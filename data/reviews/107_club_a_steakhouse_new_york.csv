5.0,4/26/2019,"Wonderful family owned steakhouse with the two generations working there. They are super friendly, treated us and our three-yr-old as family. The rib-eye we had was a 100% five star awesomeness. We will be back here soon!",0,0,0,Laszlo K.,"San Francisco, CA",8,5,4
5.0,4/25/2019,"We made reservations here for my husband's birthday. it was a fantastic dining experience. We immediately were seated upstairs with a nice view of the outdoors. We went early, when it first opens at 1700 so it was nice and quiet. The service was amazing. The waiters were attentive to our needs. We started with the crab cake which was phenomenal.  We ordered the porterhouse for two with mac and cheese and cream of spinach on the side. Everything was so delicious and tasty. That must have been the best cream of spinach ever. I wish I could take that to go and eat it at home. The porterhouse steak was so delicious and juicy. Then they had ended up giving us complimentary dessert and a photo of us that we can take home. It was one of the most pleasant experiences I have had and would definitely recommend coming back here.",0,0,0,Irene G.,"New Hyde Park, NY",24,202,158

3.0,4/21/2019,"We came here on a birthday trip to NY and this was our last big meal the night before we left. We were super excited. We got there early and the staff seated us prior to our reservation time which was nice. The tables are a little tight so there isn't much privacy but the ambiance is great. We ordered two ribeye steaks with Mac n cheese hash potatoes and creamed spinach and a couple of drinks. Our server was terrible. The water wasn't refilled, we waited approx 30 minutes for food and he was nowhere to be found throughout the meal. The two couples that ordered their meals before us didn't receive it while we were there and another couple waited 25 minutes after they had paid for someone to return with their boxed dessert. All in all when you spend this kind of money you expect a good experience and I wouldn't say this was it.",0,0,0,Andrea W.,"Downtown, Atlanta, GA",4,23,33

5.0,4/19/2019,"Club A was recommended by a trusted friend who said it was one of the best steaks she had eaten in a while.  Her recommendation did not disappoint.  The sizes of the steaks could possibly intimidate you and make you want to choose the petite filet...but don't do it.  Go all in for the bone in ribeye.  So much flavor and cooked to perfection (even though I cook mine more than the average steak lover...medium).  I thoroughly enjoyed it and it appeared I ate the whole thing, as my husband kept taking bites (knowing I couldn't finish it) and even though his fav is rare (he liked mine more than his double eagle).  We had macaroni and cheese and charred broccoli as sides.  Both wonderful.  To start, complimentary mushroom ravioli (yummy, strong, fragrant mushroom).  Also complimentary dessert trio.  Felt wine prices were reasonable and good selection.  And the staff were pleasant and the service was very good.  Overall, truly enjoyable dinner.  I second the recommendation.",0,0,0,Ramsey J.,"Houston, TX",1,75,23
4.0,4/13/2019,Visiting New York for my girlfriends birthday and decided this would be the place for her birthday dinner. Had a reservation at 8:45 didn't get seated until about 9:10. While we waited I ordered one of their signature drinks but I can't remember the name. Once seated the service was excellent. We got our drinks and rather quickly. We ordered the Jasmine and a margarita. Both were great and had a nice strong punch. The bread came next. The appetizer we ordered was a crab cake. My girlfriend loved hers. Next we received a complimentary ravioli appetizer which I assume was due to the wait. Btw it was delicious. Finally the steak arrived with the sides which were asparagus and Mac & cheese. We ordered both ordered the filet mignon medium rare and we shared the sides. The steak was excellent and the sides were good. After we ate we were offered a complimentary dessert. The vibe and atmosphere was great with a beautiful red color through out. Would definitely recommend it.,1,0,0,Trystan W.,"Philadelphia, PA",0,1,3

1.0,4/4/2019,"Would give 0 stars if I could. This place clearly focuses on ""certain"" customers. I'll let you decide what that means.

Maybe I'll go to AppleBees instead next time.",0,0,0,Nisar A.,"Sacramento, CA",0,13,1
2.0,3/31/2019,"I would have given this place five stars prior to this visit. My then-fiance and I had come here probably half a dozen times in the past three years for special occasions such as job promotion, Valentine's day and New Year's Eve and we loved it every single time. Granted, we were dressed very formally previously. Tonight we were feeling spontaneous and wanted some good steak so we figured we were just gonna stop by and get dinner. The service was horrible. The waiter seemed absentminded the whole time he was interacting with us. He first asked my order twice bc for some reason when I said it the first time, he wasn't even listening. He then left us sitting for a good ten minutes without bringing any bread. A server from another table had to come clean our plates for him and we had to ASK FOR bread. While we were being ignored and left hanging, I saw him doting over the table across from ours, servicing the side dishes on each person' plate. And no, he didn't do the same for us when our side dish came. An old white guy who looked like either the owner or the manager was walking around the restaurant greeting some tables and even taking photos and printing photos out for certain people, but we didn't get the same attention, I guess we either look not white enough or rich enough for his attention. He walked past our unattended table three times, pretending that he didn't see us--now no wonder the server felt like he could also walk past our table and pretend we weren't there. The quality of the free dessert after the meal has also deteriorated quite a lot, but since it was free, I have no right to complain. We waited about 10-15 minutes after both of us finished the dessert--I mean it was beyond obvious we were finished with the meal, folks down, napkins folded on the table, no one came to clean the plates or ask if we needed anything else. In the end we had to flag a random server to ask for the check. If this place wants to treat people differently based on whatever prejudice the servers/owners have, it better start charging people differently. I'm not paying the same amount of money as the table next to me to be ignored. Shame on you, Club A.",3,0,0,Angelina L.,"Brooklyn, NY",2,65,23
2.0,3/31/2019,"A very flavorful steak however the slogan on the back of their menu does not fit their restaurant staff or prices. The waiter who seemed to have a Russian accent, was curt and my wife and I both felt as though we weren't treated as normal costumers because we weren't dressed as formal as other guests. I asked the waiter what the size difference between a 10oz & 16oz filet was for my wife and he gave us and answer as if we were bothering him or unintelligent. I've been to restaurants before with far better food and cheaper prices and they usually will show you the size etc of a filet or how they usually are presented if you ask. Normal costumer service. This guy seemed to not want to be bothered & we felt rushed when we ordered as if he thought we weren't going to spend a lot of money when we also ordered an appetizer.The live jazz music gave a nice ambiance but was distorting the speakers upstairs extremely bad. The bone in ribeye I had was tough, nice flavor but I've had better for less money. Definitely NOT worth $58 unfortunately. Disappointed costumers.",0,0,0,David G.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,13,5
5.0,3/29/2019,"We were trying to find a nice steakhouse with a warm atmosphere, cozy but also high quality and having great food. When you try to combine all these, it is very difficult to have all at the same time regardless of the cost of the meal. So we picked Club A among all the others in Midtown and Central Park area with the help of the reviews and photos.The moment we entered the place we got the feeling that it is what we've been looking for. A live jazz trio welcomes you in this cozy place with high quality, beautiful ambiance, dimmed environment with red walls giving the impression of a high calibre jazz club.When it comes to the service and the food, I totally agree with the positive reviews. We ordered Prime Rib Eye bone in and Prime Double Eagle Skirt bone in. Both were amazing. The meat was so tasty and cooked to perfection. The sides were delicious too and the complementary Ravioli was so good.Last but least, the friendly, high quality service complemented the full pleasure of having such a great experience.

1.0,3/19/2019,"Food is good. But don't go there if you are not white, because you are not really welcomed there.

I'm giving it 3 stars based on the food.. the food was very bland, I was better off going to Applebee's to get some tasty food. The Mac & Cheese was delicious & the desserts were tasty as well. It's a good place to try out once in your lifetime. If you're celebrating a special occasion they take your picture and put it inside a card where the owner actually comes out & thanks you for coming which is pretty cool & memorable.

5.0,3/17/2019,"After I proposed to my girlfriend, we came here for dinner. We ordered two ribeyes, spinach, and potato puree; all had wonderful flavor! Although I made a reservation, I did not indicate the reason for our visit. However, our waiter was so attentive to our needs throughout the evening that at one point, he asked us if we were visiting for a special occasion and we told him that we just got engaged. Shortly after, we received complimentary ravioli and so we thought that the kitchen had made a mistake and we were just a means to avoid wasting food. But when we asked to see a menu for dessert, the waiter returned instead with a full plate of desserts on the house! Furthermore, the hostess came to our table to take our photograph and the manager came after to congratulate us and sign the photograph.

My fillet was cooked perfectly and had great flavor. The macaroni is a MUST! My husband liked the spinach which says something because he usually won't touch veggies. The waiter brought out some mushroom ravioli complements of the chef before dinner which were amazing. He then sent out an amazing desert tray also compliments of the chef!

5.0,3/8/2019,"The food especially the steak was perfect!!  I ordered the fillet minon (medium rare) as well as the mushrooms and creamy spinach side.  Not only was the food amazing but the staff, from the hostess, to the wait staff, to the manager were amazing! Any second you may need them for anything they were already there anticpating what you may ask for, or need, and already had it or did it.  It literally felt like we where the only table in the resturant although it was packed because of how awesome the service was. We ordered a bottle of wine and a bottle of water with dinner and I never had to once pour/refill my own glass of either. The ambiance was super cozy and the decor very tasteful and clean. Everything in the steak house from the decor with the rich red colors, to the very cozy fire place near the room where they take your coats,  made me feel like I was in a hunting lodge or a beautiful dinning room. The lighting was perfect as well with the decor and had a warm yellowish glow, that I personally feel made the food taste better and the evening even more relaxing and enjoyable. Last but not least the espresso and cappuccino, as well as the two desserts, we shared, the Tiramisu and Cheese cake, were a wonderful way to end the evening.  The espresso was a perfect pull and I did not even need sugar it tasted so good and paired the tiramisu perfectly.I can say when I arrived at Club A I was tired and exhausted from my work week but left feeling reenergized and happy. I was so happy with the food I need to say it again! The service also was so wonderful.... I left thinking in my mind ""What is the soonest day I can get back? Monday too soon?

5.0,3/3/2019,"By far the best steakhouse my husband and I have ever been to. The restaurant is beautiful with a romantic vibe to it. Each table has a single red rose and candle. There are two floors we ate on the second floor which seems more intimate and quiet and that's what we were looking for The staff was very friendly and attentive to us. Never did I have to refill my glass they did that for us. The waiter served us complimentary mushroom ravioli which was amazing and definitely left us wanted more.The food was amazing my husband ordered the porterhouse steak with spinach and Mac and cheese which he enjoyed to the fullest. He couldn't stop telling me how delicious his meal was. I ordered the hanger steak with a side of mushrooms . My steak was cooked to perfection and honestly can't say one bad thing about our meal. Once we finished our meal the waiter offered us complimentary desserts which we sadly declined only because we were so full from the steak. Definitely regret that choice now lol .Next time we will have the desserts .Be prepared to spend money here, but you get what you pay for we felt like a queen and a king eating at this steakhouse the decor alone will have you feeling like you are in a top notch restaurant.

Drinks we went with a nice bottle of Red suggested by our waiter , good wine went well with the food. To start u have a nice small bread basket w a nice selection of bread, really good better of course better w butter. To start we had the Garden salad very good but it was in desperate need of some dressing it had very little practically dry, good parm cheese.  The Calamari was delicious lightly battered nice dipping sauce. Main course we had the Filet Mignon & the Mushroom raviolis , great tasting piece of meet cooked perfectly with good amount of flavor the raviolis were great as well very nice light cream sauce. On the sides the Mac & cheese was OMGGGG wow! So good dripping in cheese great taste to it , the Truffle garlic fries were great as well nice taste nice & crispy. Nice looking restaurant , two floor of seating with a bar below.

It was beautifully decorated and the atmosphere was wonderful. I ordered the mixed green salad, hanger steak, creamed spinach, and the tiramisu. The salad wasnt anything new but my friend got the steak tartare that came with regular potato chips l, but the tartare itself was on point. Nothing less than great. The steak was flavorful but way too chewy (medium rare), the fillet mignon was wonderful. So soft and perfect texture. The creamed spinach was so good too, the best side dish there. The mac and cheese was good too and the garlic fries were just fries nothing special. The desserts were all good but nothing special too. We came here for the steak so it wasnt a deal breaker.

We were seated upstairs in the corner so we had a bit more privacy. The interior is so classy and romantic. The vibes here were truly wonderful. Everyone was so relaxed. The service was impeccable. The waiter was very informative and always eager to help. Both of us ordered steaks, of course. They were cooked exactly how we had asked for them to be prepared. We ordered mac and cheese and mashed potatoes as our sides. Mashed potatoes were good, super creamy. The Mac and cheese was incredible! One of the best I've had. Super cheesy, crispy on the top. Ugh, if only I could eat that everyday. They brought out a complimentary dessert plate which had cream puffs, tiramisu and a chocolate mousse cake. So sweet of them to do for my boyfriend's birthday! At the end of the night, we got our photo taken by one of the hostesses and were given a copy to take home with a letter from the business which was a great touch. We also got to talk to the owner--he was walking around talking to his guests and thanking them. He stopped at every table. It is a pleasure knowing that the people who run this place truly care about the guest experience and appreciate the patronage. We will be back for sure!",0,0,0,Lindsey A.,"Princeton, NJ",188,103,101

We were seated within minutes of our arrival. Our server was great. He was attentive and not pushy at all. Now to the food: I ordered the calamari, Filet Mignon, and whipped potatoes. My date ordered the Cesar salad, hanger steak, and Mac and cheese. The appetizers were good. The steaks were delicious. The filet was cooked perfectly, but I did like the hanger steak better. It was so flavorful. The Mac and cheese was excellent, as were the potatoes. We both ordered cheesecake for dessert. I don't eat cheesecake but my date loved his.

3.0,2/8/2019,"Food was awesome, but service was glaringly terrible for these prices.  I was there for restaurant week.  My waiter didn't seem like he could be bothered.  He came over literally seconds after giving menus to take the tables order.  He brought a regular coke instead of a diet coke.  Bread didn't come to the table, and we had to ask for it.  When the table next to ours wasn't ready to order (he did the same ""ask for an order seconds after giving a menu"" thing to them too) he actually rolled his eyes.  This is supposed to be a high end place, but this service was worse than you'd expect at a Waffle House.

The guests seated next to us sat down, the waiter comes over after about 2 minutes and says ""you know what you want?""  I've been at a diner where the service was better.  No bread. No introduction. Just rushed service.

The food on the other hand really was mostly excellent. Steaks were perfectly cooked and tasted delicious. The mac and cheese side and whipped potatoes were also great.

4.0,2/5/2019,"A couple of friends and I came to Club A Steakhouse for our restaurant week tradition. Out of all the steakhouses participating, Club A had the best options for the $42 3-course meal. Our group of 6 were seated upstairs near the window, a nice and quiet atmosphere with music that fits the scene. We each ordered different appetizers so that we can sample multiple offerings. We were able to try the Steak Tartare, Club A bacon, and the Calamari. The Steak Tartare was amazing. I was skeptical when they first brought it to the table because they served it with basic potato chips, but the meat with the egg yolk was nothing short of amazing. The slab of bacon was good, the texture wasn't the best as it was a tad rubbery (not sure of the word to use) but the flavors were great. The Calamari was nothing special, tasted like your average calamari and wasn't as crispy as I would've liked. For Entrees, 5/6 people got the Filet Mignon and the 6th person got the Hangar steak. For the sides, we got the Mac and Cheese, Cream Spinach, and mashed potatoes. The Filet Mignon was cooked exactly to my liking, it didn't have an overwhelming flavor, but Filet is Filet. The hangar steak was a bit more flavorful as it had a peppercorn sauce that was very good. As for the sides, the cream spinach was the best cream spinach that I have ever had, hands down. So good. The Mac and Cheese was also very good and would definitely recommend getting both!For Dessert, the majority of us got the Cheesecake but we were able to try the Profiteroles and the Tiramisu. I have to say, the dessert was kind of a let down. The cheesecake wasn't the best cheesecake I've had, the texture wasn't as smooth and the flavor was lacking. The Profiteroles were just little pastries with filling and the Tiramisu wasn't anything to write home about. With that being said, we did not come here for dessert, we came for steak.After reading the reviews prior to coming here, people were raving about the service being outstanding. We came here with the expectation to be blown away and left feeling a little let down. Our waiter was good, but nothing that went above and beyond. Also, it took quite a while for our appetizers and steak to be served, so it was a bit slow. This review should be a 3.5/5 but I rounded up because of how good the Steak Tartare, creamed spinach, and Mac & Cheese were.",1,0,0,Eli B.,"Queens, NY",10,103,143

They were just pleasant, welcoming, and made  sure we were happy. Myself and two friends went during restaurant week for a birthday celebration. We arrived about 10 minutes after our reservation, and was asked to wait until our table was ready. We were seated approximately 10 minutes later. While waiting, we were greeted, and thanked for visiting the restaurant. Our server Diego greeted us with warm smiles and waited on us to make our decisions. There is a special Restaurant Week menu to order from. Diego made food and drink suggestions, and took our orders. Now for the food.... I was not pleased with the food at all! The Ace margarita ($15) was disgusting. It tasted like water and tequila. The server took it back to remake the drink, and returned with a stronger tequila water. I kept it just because I didn't want to be a bother, however, my friends opted out for a glass of wine. My calamari appetizer had a burnt smell and after  taste. My entrée was salmon and mac & cheese. The Mac and cheese was very good! The salmon was dry, flavorless, and over cooked.  The cheese cake was good and better than my meal. I am unsure if the food wasn't that great bc it was restaurant week, but I was not pleased. Overall, for the service, I give the restaurant 5 stars. The food, I would give 3 stars.

The owner, Mr. Bruno also came by several times to talk to us and congratulate us on our first Anniversary together. The food was perfect. I ordered the calamari as an appetizer and my husband had the lentil soup. They were both really good! We both selected the filet mignon, and a side order of spinach and mashed potatoes. The steak was cooked exactly how we requested it and it was deliciously juicy. The spinach was amazing (I highly recommend this as a side, it's the best spinach I've ever had at a steakhouse). For dessert we both had the tiramisu, which was exquisite and the perfect end to our dinner (it contained the right amount of sugar, and was not too sweet).

5.0,1/31/2019,"I'm writing this review a bit late but I went to dinner here January 20th for my boyfriends birthday. We even showed up late to the reservation because of subway confusion but they were very nice and understanding about it. I went into a yelp search hole for about two hours trying to find the right place to get some birthday steak, so if you are doing the same, you have found the right place congratulationsFirstly my boyfriend was a little nervous about going to this place because we're college age and both have babyfaces making us look even younger and prolly out of place in a nice place like this but despite that service was above and beyond and everyone was very kind and accommodating. For an app we ordered the club A bacon, and then ordered the petite filet mignon and prime rib (not on the menu but suggested to us by our waiter), for sides we had the fries and Mac and cheese. It goes without saying everything was great. Both steaks we ordered medium rare and both came out perfect, I didn't try the prime rib but my boyfriend said it was so perfect he barely had to even chew, and mine was the same, wonderfully done for both just so so good. The fries were great and perfectly seasoned and I didn't try the Mac and cheese but good reports on that as well. One thing I do have to mention is the complimentary ravioli they gave us. It is a shame that it is not an entree because that is undeniably a game changer. I have not stopped talking about it and currently am trying to replicate something like it in my own kitchen, it was thattt good. I don't even think I like mushrooms but I guess I do now, I didn't get to take a picture of it but woww, I haven't had mushroom ravioli before so idk if that's standard for the dish but I think it was another league of its own, I just wish I could create the same myself. They also brought out a happy birthday dessert which was so nice and really did surprise my boyfriend which was so fun to watch. He loved it and I took some too and everything was great but lemme tell you that chocolate mouse cake is nutssss, so creamy and smooth wow definitely steal a bite if you can. Perfect topping to the dinner. Overall great food great service wonderful accommodations and a beautiful setting, I asked to be on the second floor in my reservation cause other reviews said to and it really was beautiful. Also the owner was so sweet as to snap a picture of us to keep, which was great because we had wanted to get a picture together but hadn't had the chance that day yet. And our waiter was wonderful and very nice and even wrapped the bone of the prime rib up for us when I asked, for my dog( i know an odd request in a place like this probably but it made my dog so happy). If you're unsure of where to go out to eat, take my word that this is the right place. The hospitality and food just make for a perfect evening.

4.0,1/31/2019,"Came here for restaurant week on a cold night. The interior decor was vintage and had a very cozy feeling. We got seated quickly. Only complaint is that the seats are a bit tight so on a cold night, you'd probably check your coats.For appetizer, I got the thick bacon. Came out in a timely manner. The bacon while delicious, was very salty. Bacon by itself is normally salty so I felt there wasn't a need to douse it with extra salt but still tasty regardless.The entree was their 10oz filet mignon. It was quite a thick piece that was cooked as asked (medium rare). The steak was pretty tender, but the taste was standard. Having been to other steakhouses (212, Peter lugers etc), something about their steak usually stands out from steak you can get at a dinner. I was slightly let down by the steak here as nothing stood out to make me go ""wow"". For dessert, I got the cream puffs. Tasted a bit weird, and not as sweet as I thought.All in all, worth a try on restaurant week but for full price, I would probably go elsewhere for better steak.",0,0,0,Andrew C.,"New York, NY",217,161,250

I usually chalk one bad experience up as a ""it happens"" but a second time is unacceptable. I ordered the 16 ounce filet and when our meals arrived to my surprise mine was the 10 ounce. When I called the waiter over and explained he swooped the 10 ounce away without asking what I would like to do. The person I was dining with had finished their meal and still no 16 ounce in site. When the 16 ounce finally arrive it was cooked at the opposite temperature I had originally requested. They took it back once again and by the time it returned I was aggravated and asked for it to go.

4.0,1/26/2019,"After reading all the mixed reviews, was excited, albeit a little apprehensive about celebrating a friend's birthday here. Had a reservation for 7pm Wednesday night. We were an hour late, so finally sat down at 8, on the second floor. There's a lot of open seating Wednesday night so don't be afraid if you're running late. You cannot reserve a table on the second floor. If you're lucky, when you come in, ask for a table upstairs and you'll be seated there. Recommend the second floor, where you'll be able to enjoy a quieter and more intimate experience along with pretty window views of the decorated streets. The first floor is nice as well, just louder and more crowded, since it's closer to the bar. The ambiance is festive and upscale. Red, white and black color scene. Live roses and candles on the tables. Red satin booths. Winter Holiday décor all over the premises. Classy music (Sinatra) on the background. Relaxing and cozy. Dress up. This is a suitable place for any kind of celebration.The service is superb. The highlight of our experience. The waiting staff are courteous and friendly. The owner walks around to check on every table, making sure everything is well. Albanian, in his 60's, he's very attentive and conscientious about the restaurant, always out and about checking on everyone and everything. At the end of your meal, you'll be photographed and receive a complementary print photo, one per your party, to commemorate the occasion. The owner personally signs and handles you your photo. Makes every customer feel valued and a priority. A good example to other establishments out there. Every table around, us including, got complementary mushroom ravioli. Every person gets an individual plate with one huge ravioli. A nice touch. Really delicious. Very meaty and rich mushroom filling. Fragrant white sauce with sage and rosemary. Wish I could eat an entire plate of these!After our meal, we got a complementary dessert plate with a lighted candle for the birthday boy. Super sweet touch! A piece of tiramisu, a piece of chocolate mousse, cream puffs, and canollis. A huge plate that fed our party of four! Very appreciative of it. The chocolate mousse was a favorite. Very smooth, light, delicate, not too sweet, just a perfect concluding note to our dinner. Tiramisu was dry and bland. Too little mascarpone cream in proportion to dry lady fingers, which weren't drenched in liquor, coffee, or any kind of syrup. Cream puffs weren't the best either--crunchy shell, but not enough of the stale whipped cream. The canollis were tasty, nothing additional to comment on. Now to what we actually paid for. The food is average, not the best I've ever had. Well prepared, but just not the best you can find in NYC.Complementary bread basket was fresh, crispy and delicious. Natural butter tasted great. Fried calamari ($16) were simple, well cooked, the batter wasn't too hard. The calamari themselves were a bit chewy and the tiny portion was definitely not worth $16. Lobster bisque ($14) was disappointing. Sweetish broth. Contained exactly one lonesome, tiny piece of lobster. Forgettable at best. Skip. Royal Platter ($31 per person) was mediocre. Cold crab leg, shrimp with cocktail sauce, half a tiny lobster tail. Definitely overpriced and not worth it. Skip. Fillet mignon ($44 for 10 oz. $51 for 16 oz.) was delicious. Perfect seasoning, crunchy exterior, soft, delicate interior. Enjoyed thoroughly and would return for this steak. NY strip ($51) was tasty and perfectly prepared. Everyone at our table was very satisfied with their steaks.We asked for steak sauces, and the waiter brought a platter consisting of three house made sauces: au poivre, peppercorn, and bordelaise. Make sure you ask! They really do complement the steaks nicely. My favorite was the peppercorn. Sage & rosemary Fries ($10) were the biggest letdown. Was super excited but we got unlucky and got cold, stale, tasteless, frozen, pre-cut supermarket variety. No one tasted sage or anything. Such a disappointment, this reminded me of a cardboard. Creamed spinach ($10) was the best side we tasted. Creamy, sweet, tender. Definitely get this. The only downside was the portion size. Could've been more substantial. Charred broccoli ($10) and asparagus ($12) were a pleasant tasty surprise and worth  a try. Flavorful and well cooked. Again, the portion size could've been bigger.Wasn't a fan of the cocktails we tried. Mojitos, old fashioned, buck, and grandaddy all tasted watery and sweeter than they should. The check came out to $440 for four people. Plus tip, you're looking at over $500. Overall, prepare to splurge, as with any steak house. A solid experience that we enjoyed but not necessarily the best we've had.

For entree we ordered the hanger steak medium well and the mushroom ravioli, the steak was dry and tough to eat while ravioli was absolutely delicious. Dessert we had the profiteroles which was the best part of the entire meal. The service however... I never felt so ignored at a restaurant. Since the steak was dry, we were very thirsty. I tried asking for water three times but was ignored. The worst part was the staff was super attentive to the table next to us, filling up there glass after they took one sip!

5.0,12/30/2018,"Highly recommend this outstanding steakhouse experience to anyone - we were absolutely BLOWN AWAY by the professionalism, customer service and quality of the food. The outside was beautiful- decked out in Christmas lights and there was a live jazz bar playing in the bar.  We came for our anniversary, and we were seated upstairs against the window overlooking the street, with a candle and a red rose. Our menus were personalized and said happy anniversary on the top. After ordering the porterhouse for two and glasses of wine, our server brought out a sample of mushroom ravioli in a mushroom cream sauce compliments of the chef- so great! Our porterhouse came out done perfectly on a hot plate and extra juice to pour on and sear ourselves. The creamed spinach was amazing as well. They cut the porterhouse thinner than other steakhouses have so it appeared we had more steak to choose from! Seasoning was great. Finally, they brought out a complimentary dessert (piece of tiramisu, chocolate mousse, and cream puff pastries) on a plate that said ""happy anniversary"" in chocolate syrup. They took a photo of us and printed it out and had the owner hand deliver it to us with a personally signed thank you note. Beyond impressed by this incredible experience and customer service.

I am really glad I chose this place. Upon entrance we were quickly taken to our reserved table and my mom was given a birthday menu. This place is really beautiful with low lighting and beautiful dark red hues. Each table has a lit candle and a rose. We ordered 2 entrees hanger steak and one lamb chop. Shared cream spinach and mashed potatoes. We were given complimentary bread and awaited our meal while enjoying this beautiful atmosphere. This restaurant feels very classy and upscale. The Christmas lights were beautiful. Onto the meal, the steaks were both medium-well which tasted delicious. It comes with a sauce which really isn't needed. What was really delicious was the lamp chop which I got a bite from. The meat really just melts in your mouth. Wished I ordered that. The creamed spinach was also a favorite among our table. It was finished pretty quickly. After finishing our meal. A complimentary desert assortment that said happy birthday was brought to our table and we thoroughly enjoyed that. They took our picture and put it in a special card. The owner (I assumed) was very involved and frequently checked on us and other diners making sure everything was okay.

The sides were delicious as well. The sautéed spinach and asparagus were 100% the best I've had in a long time. I ate at the bar and the bartender made a very nice gin martini to start.

All four of us ordered the filet mignon, I ordered it medium rare, two of my friends ordered medium, and my other friend ordered his steak medium well. All of our steaks were overcooked. We were hungry, so didn't send our steaks back but none of us were happy. My medium rare looked more like a medium, the mediums looked medium well and the medium well looked well done. So, every steak was cooked one level more than requested. Just be aware of this and maybe order it a level below what you'd normally want.

Must say the reviews were good as well.I went there with 2 friends and my sister, as a respect to her BF who just visited NY for the first time. We had reservations so we didn't wait at all, we set kinddda in the middle so it was a bit loud. It was also very dark, I couldn't understand if it was for the need of drama or trying to save on electricity bill... Anyway, food- I ordered a filet mignon and a side of asparagus and shared a side of Mac and cheese with my sister, it was supposed to be an appetizer but it came along with the food, mistakes - we all do them it's fine... We had to open with their braed platter that was very fine.You would think, how can you ruin asparagus plate? Or a nice piece of stack? Well yeah you can, very easily.The stack was dry to death, I asked medium, there was nothing medium about it. The Mac and cheese had more oil than the oil tank the fry the French fries in, it was a short way to painful heartburn.The poor asparagus was soaked with oil as if it was water. So even if you wanted to get a little bit health from eating veggies, nope you can't.The waitress realize something was wrong but he was very busy and I choose not to bother him with that, after all it seemed like a pattern.He gave us samples of 3 desserts, it's the first time that I could stick to my word of skipping dessert. Not cause I wanted, cause it was horrible. We got some type of dough dipped in guess what?! Yup! Oil! Some cake that I guess was supposed to be a cheesecake, but it wasn't. A dissaster!So why 2 starts  after all? The service.The Service was rally wonderful! You can see that the waitres work there for many years, they know what they need to do, and they were really nice.

2.0,9/23/2018,"Came back again for my boyfriend's birthday after having such a wonderful dinner last year, but was utterly disappointed.We came during the dinner rush and saw the inconsistency on the food and service. We ordered the same appetizer, the Salmon Tartare and the Club A Bacon. The salmon did not taste as fresh and light like last year. It seems like it was lacking the citrus flavor, which made the overall dish feel a bit more heavy. The bacon also had it flaws. It did not melt in your mouth like it use to and they also changed the side sauce from BBQ to plain old ketchup. As for the Porter House for Two, there was this weird after taste that I can't put my finger on. I think it was the oil that was poured on the steak when the waiter was serving us, but I'm not too sure.  For complimentary dishes, there was no ravioli appetizer this year. However, we did get the complimentary dessert, but it seems like the calligraphy for ""Happy Birthday"" has changed drastically. It use to be a beautiful script, and now it looks like a kid wrote it.  As for service, it was quite difficult to get the attention of staff whenever we needed something.

5.0,9/20/2018,"This was one of the most unforgettable experiences I've had at a steakhouse. I came in for dinner with my two friends that I haven't seen in a few years.When making the reservation over the phone, the hostess was very pleasant and asked if we were celebrating anything. Although we weren't, she promised us a good table and didn't fail. The decor is beautiful and classic for a steakhouse with pictures along the red wall. We started with a steak tartar and crab cake. The steak tartar was delicious and melts in your mouth, the crab cake was a bit on the drier side, id recommend a nice sauce to go with it. We chose a medium bodied Pinot noir to accompany our delicious porterhouse. Since we started with appetizers, we ordered the porterhouse for 2 instead of 3 and it was the perfect amount. The manager/owner Bruno, checked on our table a few times which made us feel very special and added to our experience. At the end of dinner the server brought out complimentary desserts that consisted of three large pastries and a fruit tray. The service was impeccable, not too overbearing but we also never had to look around for the server. When the food came out the server and food runners split it up for us and plated it in front which I was pleasantly surprised by. It saves the awkward reaching over each other and splitting of the food. To top off the night we also had a glass of champagne. The hostess was very sweet and came over to take our picture that she also printed out. Bruno signed it and wished us a farewell. Beautiful night and experience. I would strongly recommend this restaurant to anyone. Apart from steaks, the menu had other tasty options that I would love to come back and try when I'm in New York again.",1,0,0,Katya A.,"The Strip, Las Vegas, NV",278,38,6

5.0,9/12/2018,"We wanted to end our vacation with another amazing steak dinner and while we would have loved to return to Peter Lugars, we wanted to stay around our hotel.  After looking at multiple reviews club a steakhouse came up as somewhere nearby us that seemed like it would be a good choice. We were immediately greeted when we walked in on a very rainy and gloomy Monday evening. The location wasn't that busy. The menu is decent in size and options as well as the wine list is extensive. We were pleasantly surprised that they carried chocolate block - a south African wine we love but can hardly find anywhere. Naturally, we ordered a bottle for the two of us. Our server was pleasant enough but he seemed more concerned with a table that clearly were regulars as we watched both managers on duty stop off at the table multiple times and based on their conversations, it was easy to tell they were regulars. We both ended up ordering the bone in 24 ounce ribeye steak. My husband ordered it medium I ordered it medium rare. When my husband first cut into his steak the first couple of cuts it was easy to tell that it was definitely more of a medium well versus medium but by the time he cut in the third time it was back to being medium. My steak was cooked perfectly at the medium rare although some of the exterior pieces were definitely more on the medium well side and there was a decent amount of fat on the steak (i have a thing with fat and don't like any on my steaks).I ordered the lobster bisque as a starter and it was delicious. Shortly after I finish the lobster bisque the server brought out a mushroom ravioli that was on the house. It was delightful and delicious very earthy in tone. At the end of our meal we were brought out a small plate of desserts including tiramisu , cheesecake and a creampuff. Again this was on the house and we were shocked when our server let us know that the manager wanted to buy us a drink as well. Overall, we really enjoyed our experience and would return again.",5,0,3,Kristi B.,"Winter Garden, FL",45,105,260

Guess you can't really complain about that in the city though?The food and service were decent. My date and I were excited for the thick cut bacon but it was a little too salty for our taste.

4.0,8/25/2018,"My experience here was good overall, but it was probably not my best steakhouse experience. My friend and I came here for restaurant week. We both got med-rare 10oz filet mignon steaks; good, but not the best I've had. I would be a bit hesitant to pay the normal menu price of $42 for this specific steak, especially since the sides cost extra in the $10 range. Our meals each came with one side - I got the mac n cheese, while my friend got the whipped potatoes. We shared the sides and I thought the potatoes were better. (The mac n cheese was too greasy/mushy and did not have enough cheese or flavor.) I did, however, enjoy the House salad (mesclun mix, strawberries, pecan, shaved pecorino) and my friend said she liked her Caesar salad. For dessert, both the tiramisu and NY style cheesecake were good - on the lighter side and tasty. Overall, this is probably still a good value for restaurant week, but I would probably only come back during regular times if the food was a notch better, given the price. Service from the hostess was good, but our server was a bit curt.",12,0,8,Nataly N.,"Brooklyn, NY",355,489,1340

My steak was supposed to be medium but came to the table well done. The mac and broccoli were both burnt. I called the waiter back and we told him about our steaks and he offered to fix the problem.

The sides are a great compliment especially the Mac and cheese. I do order the dessert which is good, but never could finish it after a hearty steak dinner. My bad.

Firstly, although I did notice a portable a.c near the entrance the restaurant was a very comfortable,  cool respite from the heat outside.Food: For appetizers my group got the fried calamari and smoked bacon. Both were excellent. Everyone chose the Seared Salmon for the main course which was beautifully served and delicious. The sides we chose were garlic fries, whipped potatoes and creamed spinach. I would recommend any of these as they were all tasty. We heeded the online warning about the profiteroles and opted for NY cheesecake and tiramisu. Again, these dishes did not disappoint and the portion sizes for everything were quite large.Service: Our waiter was Mario, and I made a point of complimenting him when we left. He was friendly, funny and helpful throughout our entire meal.

I can't speak for others who have had bad experiences during restaurant week, but that was not my experience at all! From the minute we walked in and were seated the experience was top notch. Big Kudos to our waiter, Mario! He was attentive, helpful and funny. He constantly checked on us o make sure everything was perfect, without being overbearing or creepy. The food was heavenly. We had the bacon and calamari as appetizers. Delicious. Even though it was a Steakhouse we all got the Salmon as our main. Salmon was well seasoned, and beautifully plated. For the sides, we had mashed potatoes, creamed spinach and sweet potato fries. Again, all tasty. Now, for dessert, we listened to the yelpers and avoided the profiteroles and tried the cheesecake and tiramisu. The tiramisu was my favorite and it was PERFECT. I'm not a fan of cheesecake, but I did have a taste of it and it was good. The person eating it thought it was awesome. All in all 5 star restaurant. 5 star restaurant week experience.

2.0,8/3/2018,"I'm so sad that my experience here is so different than other reviewers.  I was really looking forward to my dinner here yesterday and was terribly underwhelmed.Walking in, there were portable ACs in multiple locations.  It was a bit warm, but kudos to the restaurant for trying to cool the place down.  It was still plenty warm with all the portable ACs.  I do love that people who got bottles of red wine had their wine decanted in Riedel decanters - the ones like the horn or Eve.We had a reservation at 7:15, and were brought upstairs to our table within 10 minutes of arriving.  Initially the service at our table was attentive - the water was always refilled before it was empty.  The server was nice enough at the beginning when we were ordered drinks, and then our meals.  Service just deteriorated after that initial interaction. The Food - ordered from the RW menu- Salad - fair- Bacon - good- Filet - undercooked- Hanger steak - good- Fries - average- Mac and cheese - average- Profiteroles - TERRIBLE - not edible- Tiramisu - fairWe asked for our meat medium rare, probably due to the size of the filet, it's 10oz, but tall - the middle was pretty much rare, which my dining companion did not care for.  The rest of the meal was fair, I would not trek over to the east side for this meal, nor would I pay full price for it.What really struck me was the lack of real service.  At no point did anyone ask how our meal was - b/c I would have the undercooked steak, as well as the undercooked profiteroles.  The profiteroles came with a chocolate mousse underneath - not part of the description.  I don't really eat chocolate and would have appreciated a head's up and would have ordered the cheesecake.  The pastry chef at Club A should be embarrassed to have sent out the profiteroles, but not one person asked how we were doing or how the food was after dropping it off.  While there were constantly servers walking around, I feel it was for the presence and not sure what they were doing.To top that off, the table next to us the waiter was super attentive to the 3 women who sat there.  Came multiple times to check on their drinks, how their food was, cracking jokes about his grandmother or grandfather in the kitchen, etc.  Totally different service than ours.  He even went and served their sides onto each of their plates.  While I would not have expected that, the vast difference in service proves they are capable of service, just depends on who they like.I'm disappointed in my meal, and really was hoping that we had found a gem to visit more often.  Instead I was extremely underwhelmed given all the positive reviews.  I wish I had a different experience.",5,1,0,Linda W.,"New York, NY",39,421,124
4.0,8/2/2018,"Came here with my boyfriend for restaurant week. I give it 4 stars for the amazing food, but the service was definitely lacking. I'm not sure if it was because it was crowded for restaurant week or if it was because they didn't care about you if you got the restaurant week special. Anyways, I got there about a half hour late and they still sat us which was nice. To start we ordered the Caesar salad and the bacon. I wouldn't get the caesar again, definitely better elsewhere and was very small and just lettuce not even with much dressing. My boyfriend got the bacon which was OUTSTANDING. We then got the hanger steak and the filet and sides of Mac and cheese and mashed potatoes. Both were super good and large for restaurant week portions. We took some steak home each. The steaks were cooked perfectly, I liked my filet better but its a preference I suppose. The sides were also good, I don't love Mac and cheese but the bread crumbs made it. The waiter was not very friendly. we each had 1 drink that my boyfriend got us at the bar beforehand. No one asked us if we wanted to order another drink or a bottle of wine. We also got no wine list or drink menu. Guess they weren't trying to make $ there because we probably would've. For dessert we got the profiteroles, which I did not like because they were too fried.

We called Club A and they quickly realized this was for a special occasion and were able to accommodate us last minute. Not only did we have a beautiful delicious dinner, but they went above and beyond and brought us out complimentary desserts and celebratory shots for our party of 10! They took photos for us and even had one printed for the bride. I can't say enough good things about this place!

If you come at a later time it would probably be best to have a reservation. I've come here a few times and have never been disappointed. For our meal we got the crab cake, porterhouse for 2, and the mac and cheese. Even after having not come for 2-3 years the food the quality of the food remains the same . The crab cake was nice and crunchy on the outside but soft on the inside. They also gave us each a mushroom ravioli on the house (I believe you get this if you get the porterhouse) which was nice and creamy. The Mac and cheese had a super nice crust on the top which gave it a nice crunch. As for the porterhouse we asked for a medium rare and it was cooked perfectly and tasted amazing. I was stuffed by the end and we struggled to finish our meal. They also give complimentary dessert which is another plus! The staff is great and the food is amazing.

5.0,7/15/2018,"When looking for a romantic, fancier night out for our anniversary we obviously checked out food blogs and google for recommendations and this was one was on almost every list.. the reviews are a great example of why!! Walking in, the atmosphere is somewhere you can have an intimate dinner.. theres a single rose on the table, they light the candle upon sitting and greet you with such a pleasant vibe!! We were seated upstairs where there is a window overlooking the street and although it isnt much to look at, it just adds to the ambience of the place when youre seated right there..The wine list is fantastic and has so many choices - we asked the waiter for a recommendation and we had the Emeritus vineyards 2014 hallberg ranch Pinot Noir which was delicious! The one ""issue"" (because its not really an issue) was every other table around us who got a bottle of wine had a decanter and we were not offered one but the table next to us was..?We had the jumbo shrimp and caesar salad for appetizers (along with the bread which was warm when put on the table).. both had the perfect amount of flavoring/dressing. They gave each of us a mushroom ravioli on the house - neither of us are big mushroom people but we figured we would try it... OMG WAS IT GOOD. After reading all of the reviews and speaking to others who recommended this place, we decided on the porterhouse for 2 with the mac & cheese and sautéed spinach for sides. The waitstaff was so attentive the whole night - refilling waters, wine, clearing the table, making sure we had everything we needed, etc. [Thank you Alfredo!!!!]The main course was DELICIOUS. We have been to many steakhouses in NYC and both agreed this was THE best steak we have ever had. The presentation was spectacular - the way they serve the steak, already sliced, plate sizzling, rubbed along the end of the plate with the juices and served to you... it was like watching art..We ordered medium rare and it absolutely was...The filet mignon melted in our mouth, the strip was just as incredible and the flavor was the perfect amount - just a little butter and the juices was all it needed.The sides were ...sides. They filled you up and were good but the main star was obviously what you come for: the steak.They give you a complimentary dessert since we said it was our anniversary and come over to take a picture, print it and give you it in a little fold out - such a cute idea and the picture was great! (The plate had creampuffs, tiramisu and we think carrot cake - the only flaw IF i had to say one, was they should give a choice of what to put on the sampler, we saw they had different tables getting different things and what if you had a food allergy or didnt like what was on the plate?)

3.0,7/14/2018,"I feel a little bad about posting this because the restaurant gave us a lot of extras to make up for the problem we had.  I think, though, that it's important to fellow open table users to know the experience. A steak house should know how to cook steak. I asked for char rare, my buddy asked for medium rare.  Mine came out very rare but no char.  The did not have or at least use a very hot fire on a very cold piece of meat that is required for char rare.  My buddies came out over done.  It's one thing to cook always a little less than ordered but to have one under and one over cooked seems to me to be a lack of training. I kept mine but my buddy didn't want his so he sent it back. A loooonnnngggg time later he got a new steak and it was done correctly. By that time I had finished mine. To their credit they gave us a fruit plate that was beautiful and a desert tray with three different deserts. That was really nice.  I did see the steak for two served Peter Luger style and that looked very good so it may be that the shared porterhouse is there specialty and it's worth going for that.

5.0,7/6/2018,"If you read nothing else I write, all you need to know is Club A Steakhouse is PHENOMENAL. Our experience began with the owner seating us upstairs, and wishing me a happy birthday. The menu I was given had happy birthday printed on the top, which was a nice personal touch. We started off our meal with the bacon appetizer which was THE BEST BACON I've had in my 31 years of existence. It was just the slightest amount of fatty, full melt in your mouth flavor. It did come with a sauce which tasted like ketchup and cocktail sauce together and complimented the bacon very nicely. We then had the porterhouse for two which was excellent, cooked medium rare just as we requested. The steak was perfectly charred outside and buttery soft inside. For sides, we had the potato purée and the mac and cheese. The potato purée was a straight 10/10 very nicely left gutsy seasoned and so dam deliciously creamy. The mac and cheese was good, not phenomenal. The waiter then brought over a complimentary dessert sampler of 3 desserts, they were all fantastic!! As we were given dessert, a woman came over with a camera and took a complimentary photo of us. Shortly after, the owner came over, asking how the meal was and signed a card with the photo inside.

This was our last stop in our NYC trip and were about to hop on a flight to Chicago. We didn't expect much and we were a little bit nervous because we weren't dressed up. We were both in shorts and had our luggage, but when we walked in we were greeted and they asked if they could store our luggage for us. They made us feel very welcome the minute we walked in. The waiter was very polite and attentive. We ordered our food and during the middle of the wait, I was informed that our flight was canceled and that it was rescheduled for two days later. We tried looking up other flights, but they were all booked or were unavailable till the next day. This was very bad, but to make a long story short the food and the customer service kept my spirits high and made us both very happy despite the flight cancellations. The bacon slice was thick and delicious. The filet mignon we had was phenomenal, extremely juicy and tasty. The sides of asparagus and whipped potatoes were also very good. They gave us comped mushroom ravioli, took our photos, and gave us a birthday dessert with decadent and rich desserts. They even gave us a comped photo/card with a heartfelt and special message signed/presented by the owner.

The food was phenomenal. My husband and girls ordered the Ceasar salad, I had the Beet salad with goat cheese. My girls shared a Hangar steak and both my husband and I ordered the Prime NY steak. We shared the whipped potatoes, mac 'n cheese, and asparagus. Plenty of food for the 4 of us. The steaks were perfectly cooked to medium, full of flavor, tender, and juicy. The steaks needed no added condiments but the sauces served to accompany them took them to a whole new level. In between the salad and main course we were treated to an amuse-bouche of mushroom ravioli...DELICIOUS! For dessert both our girls received a dessert platter fit for a Queen. Tiramisu, cheesecake, and cream puffs on a bed of chocolate mousse. They also brought out a tower of fresh fruit...oranges, honeydew melon, red and green apples, and red and green grapes.

5.0,6/25/2018,"This place was outstanding. I was looking for a really nice dry aged steak and I found it. Though it doesn't appear on the menu I ordered the porterhouse for one. The menu only shows porterhouse for two or more. They bring you out a heated dinner plate and then serve your steak table-side on a sizzling platter. Very cool touch. I was also treated to a complimentary taster of their mushroom ravioli in between my appetizer and main course. Dessert was also on the house. This was just a product of over the top guest service. I had nothing but compliments for the manager when he came by my table. The atmosphere is dim and quiet with nice music playing softly in the background. It would be very romantic for a date. Mario was my server and he was fantastic as well. I only have three minor critiques I noticed...1. I was offered tap water when I sat down. I have a real adversity to the term ""tap water"" at a restaurant of this caliber. Filtered or still water would have been a better word choice. 2. One of the waiters carries his wine opener in the waist of his pants. Looked very tacky and I wouldn't want to have my bottle of wine opened with an opener that's been down the backside of his pants. 3. They had a great wine list but did not offer a Zinfandel by the glass. That being said, none of that could put a damper on a fabulous meal I had here.

As for the food, we started with a mixed salad which was dressed properly. I hate when restaurants envelop the salad with their dressing. I moved into the filet mignon which had a great sear to it on the outside but I feel that my steak was cooked a bit past medium lending it to be dry on certain bites. The sides were phenomenal.

5.0,6/9/2018,"I left the choosing for our mutual birthday dinner for myself and my girlfriend up to her this year. I gave a list of about 8 restaurants and she chose Club A. So first off making reservation to this too steakhouse was very easy and they accommodated is with ease. Letting them know I wanted to make it special for her birthday. We had table for two near the big window view of the front and it was in the corner. We started off with the thick cut grilled bacon and a Caesar salad. The bacon was perfectly cooked with great flavor a salty, Smokey, goodness juicy yet crisp with the fat just melting it was a perfect pairing with their signature Club A steak sauce. The Caesar salad was not to my girlfriends liking simply because she does not eat seafood and the anchovy was pronounced as a flavor profile. I on the other hand have a different taste for foods of all kinds and quite enjoyed the true Caesar salad the anchovy was a salty addition that went well with the flavors Of the salad. We also received a complimentary pasta dish which unfortunately I ate too quickly to take a picture of that was delicious. This being our first time there for sides we weren't quite sure of the size and or what we wanted to try. So we got three sides the Mac and cheese, which had a nice crust on top yet was an ooey gooey creamy deliciousness on the inside. The charred broccoli with garlic and chili was very good the charred always brings such depth to any dish with fresh garlic in it. Lastly we ordered the crispy fingerling potatoes aioli the aioli was perfect addition to the salty crispy hot potatoes with its tang. Our entrees now here's where it gets intense. My girlfriend had the petite filet mignon which was very flavorful and still juicy although she gets it cooked way too much in my opinion. Me on the other hand I got the prime bone-in aged ribeye 24oz medium rare. The steak came to the table and when I cut into it the outside had the most perfect crust on it and once the knife got through the crust the inside was like butter, juicy, flavorful, and tender. I didn't finish it all but once I got home I did what good table Manners prohibited me from doing in the restaurant which was attack that bone like dog. Club A accommodated our birthday celebration with a complimentary picture and card printed at the restaurant and a complimentary dessert with a happy birthday wish on it. I will definitely be heading back toClub A and recommending them to everyone I know. The service was fantastic, the owner a kind and friendly man and the food simply amazing.

Tried the dry aged rib eye (24 oz!!!!) as well as the Mac and cheese and fries sides. Steak was tender, flavorful, and well cooked.

Still met expectations. Bread basket wasn't as fresh as before but bacon still better than Luger's IMO. Got the steak tartare (decent), hanger steak and filet mignon were excellent, creamed spinach and Mac&cheese equally as good. Dessert was mediocre and the wine was decent.

5.0,5/29/2018,"Steak restaurants are a dime a dozen, especially in NY. I saw the great reviews on Yelp, made reservations for Friday on OpenTable (630PM) to celebrate an event the idea being to avoid chain steak restaurants.As we walked in were pleasantly surprised to see a live jazz band playing on the first floor. We were taken up to the second floor and seated. From the very beginning, the service we received was phenomenal. From acknowledging the celebration, having a customized menu for the event and just the overall care to refill glasses ask us how everything was. Decided to skip appetizers and go straight to our entrees.... Ordered the 16oz filet (medium) with Mac n cheese and mushrooms to share. My steak was massive... in general the largest filet I've seen (no bone) is a 10-12oz. I even asked the server if the 16oz was a bone in filet to which he replied it was not.Granted I couldn't finish the steak it was a great takeout item for lunch the following day. The food was amazing, the service was stellar and the restaurant in general was very clean and nicely decorated.

I can't recommend this cut of meat more - sooo good! Had a nice glass of Cabernet that was recommended by the bartender that perfectly complimented the steak.Overal vibe here is really cool too - they had a jazz trio playing, and they've got the sound so dialed-in that it was the perfect volume even sitting right near them at the bar.This is gonna be my go-to spot for steak when I'm in the city.

5.0,5/1/2018,"My friend brought me to this place and I just had the best food experience ever. If you think the Alexander's Steakhouse (but Alexander do have better presentation though) in the Bay Area is good then you should go to NY and try out this place! Especially the price is also reasonable!!We ordered the beef tartar as a starter. The flavor of the tartar was well executed. For some of the tartar you'll taste a weird raw meat taste or the meat is super soggy, usually mean the meat is not in good condition. But the beef tartar here was amazing. The flavor, texture, and the quality of the beef is very well prepared. Nothing more I can say about it.We also ordered a 24 oz bone-in rib eye and 16oz filet Mignon. Whenever I eat my rib-eye I usually will cut the fat out because it's never reduce to the right quality and it just taste nasty for me (if the texture is not right I don't eat it. It will gross me out). But the fat on this rib-eye was perfectly reduced. You can taste the flavor from the fat, beef, and the flavor from using wood and/or charcoal to grill the steak. The flavor was so good that I wanted to order a second 24 oz bone-in rib eye.... Even though I was super stuffed by one steak. The Filet Mignon itself was a bit dry to begin with. But as you work your way to the mid-section it's more juicy and the flavor just get better. Don't think simply grilling this steak on the grill is the best way the execute the meat. But the flavor was great.We also ordered some side dishes and 2 bottles of red wine. Honest I am a bit disappointed that they do not have any European wine (more into French and Italian) but only have California Napa/Sonoma county's wine.... I am from the Bay Area so those wine are just not too appealing to me when I am in the east coast lol... But I mean those wine are still good with the dinner with a real reasonable price. One of the bottle was $100 but the Market selling price is like $70. I don't think a $30 dollar mark-up is absurd at all. Some places in California the mark-up is more than 50%.... so yea.. you can do the math!As for the complementary dessert I really loved their cheesecake. The cheesecake was creamy and with the right density. It's not overly sweet  either. The cream puff itself it's also really good. But not as good as the cheesecake in my personal opinion.if anything, I would wish they help us to celebrate my friend's graduation from CU's PhD program. But then we forgot to mention to the waiter since the food was just amazing and we just kept talking about the food all night long....Overall, I would definitely come back to this place if I ever visit NY again.

The dining area was quiet with a polite hum of conversation. I searched my brain for any remnants of etiquette rules. Sadly, the food did not live up to the fancy vibe. I haven't been to many steakhouses, but the entree is just meat with no accompaniment. You order sides separately. We started off with the crab cake, which was so fishy that we didn't care to finish it. The beet salad and bacon apps were fine but not particularly memorable. For entrees, we shared a bit around the table. The swordfish was also fishy. Filet mignon was cooked well but could have been seasoned much better. The hanger steak was probably the best entree.  I found myself dipping my filet into the hanger steak au poivre sauce to give it some more flavor. The sides probably stole the show. The mac and cheese was delicious and the whipped potato puree was quite nice. I don't think a steakhouse should be all about the sides, though.",4,2,0,Melissa G.,"New York, NY",25,211,116

I guess, me! And at that price point, they should be able to get medium well right. On the side I had asparagus. It was okay tasting, but pretty bland.

It was a very nice time that i could never forget and its main reason is this restaurant Club A Steakhouse which is impressed me with their excellent service.Me and my boss make little bit appointment here to complete our dinner and finished our final discussion. This place is really beautiful and enchanting environment which is help us to finished our personal discussed. No sound pollution and gathering here. You may come here with your FNF without any hesitations.Food service was awesome. It complemented it well for dinner. When we ordered the staff to get chicken he took the order very diligently. I am impressed we just wait two or three minutes our dinner is ready. I want to say they are very professional and friendly.

3.0,3/7/2018,"The staff deserves a 5 star rating.  The food, however, does not.PROS:  Staff was friendly.   The interior is cool looking, very nice ambiance.  Love the dim lighting and the photos on the wall.  It feels like a classic, elegant steakhouse.CONS:  The food really left something to be desired.  The free bread basket was cold and hard.Appetizer:   Seafood tower, consisting of Lobster, Crab, and Shrimp.  The seafood tasted fresh, but the platter lacked horse-radish (to add to your cocktail sauce to control the spice) and warm butter, which would have made the lobster perfect.   At most places i wouldn't complain, but for a steakhouse at this level, those touches need to be on there.   The cocktail sauce was not spicey, nor was their tartar sauce.  Both tasted like they came from a can.Entrees:   The filet was good.  Not great.  Barely seasoned, and very bland.  I had to ask for steak sauce, which is something I NEVER do.  It really must be a last resort situation.  Their in-house steak sauce was very sweet, almost like ketchup.The side dish of asparagus was extremely basic.  Nothing about it said you couldn't do it at home in 5 minutes.  I expected more.Dessert:   Cheesecake was dry.  Tiramisu was good though.OVERALL:  I wanted to give this place a 5 because I LOVED the staff.  I just don't think for the price, I'd go back for their food.  There are tons of other steak places in NYC to try.",0,0,1,Peter C.,"Boston, MA",1007,262,464

After telling the waiter the steak was medium rare (literally came with a pick in it that said medium rare) instead of medium well they threw it back on the grill and brought it out well done.... -_-.

Our Groupon deal was fabulous, however you are not told you have to order from a specific selection when you purchase the deal - photo included. Also I uploaded my receipt so show how intense they were about receiving a proper gratuity based off how much the price would have been without the Groupon. Totally understand they want a good tip but I also think that's kind of tacky. If businesses are so worried about getting tips - don't offer a deal on Groupon then. The food was delicious. Mashed potatoes and calamari were nothing to ride home about. The filet minon (make sure you also ask for steak sauce!) was good but not as hot as we expected it to come out. The tiramisu dessert was SO good though!

5.0,2/12/2018,"Club A Steakhouse is a very beautiful restaurant. What adds to its charm is its staff; they are on point with service, as well as not making me feel uncomfortable despite being WAY WAY underdressed. I came from an appointment and came in jeans, sneakers, and a duffle bag. Everyone else was polished, and to be honest I looked like I didn't belong. But they still welcomed me and I really appreciated the gesture. I came alone and was seated at a corner table. I loved it. I had the view of the restaurant and its beautiful decor. I was in luck and it was last day if NYC Restaurant Week and I got to enjoy a three-course meal for a steal! I ordered the Club A Thick Cut Bacon to start, which was really good. The sauce that came with it complemented it well. For dinner, I had a Filet Mignon (10oz) and to be honest, it was alright. It wasn't seasoned as much as I would like, but then again that makes it better than it being overly seasoned. I got the Mashed Potato, as recommended by the server, and as simple as it was, I was glad I got it. I asked for some steak sauce and they gave me the same sauce for the bacon. As good as it was for the bacon, it wasn't something I would pair with the filet mignon, just because it is lean and for the temperature I got it (rare), it just didn't go well. I'm happy that they did cook the steak to temperature I liked! For dessert, I got tiramisu. I haven't had tiramisu in years and this did not disappoint! It was good and creamy and not frozen like some places. It was a good choice. Service overall was great. Everyone was on top of their job, refilling my empty water glass, asking if I wanted another drink, checking up on how my food was, managers checking up guests... Everything was great.

3.0,2/2/2018,"Really romantic inside and good service but the food was so bland and just not good. We came for restaurant week for dinner on a Friday. When you enter there is a bar and a real fireplace with actual wood not the electric kind. On thursday to Saturday there is live jazz music which is great. The live music is downstairs where the tables for larger groups are and upstairs you can hear it on the speakers. Upstairs has a bar also with several tables for two. We had a nice table by the window.  We started with two drinks, one a glass of caubernet for 16 dollars and another a Leo mojito which was really tasty. We were brought a basket of bread which had a couple pieces. Bread was pretty good with a side of salted butter. For our appetizers we got calamari and bacon slab. Both portions were pretty descent. The calamari was ok not bad but not great, lacked a bit of flavor. Bacon was good. Next we had the filet mignon and hanger steak. Portions weren't too bad 10oz for filet and not sure how big for steak but pretty descent size. We had a side of mash potato and a side of creamed spinach. The sides were ok again not great but not too bad, the potatoes were too whipped for my taste. Lastly for desert we had cheesecake and tiramisu. I liked the cheesecake and my husband liked his tiramisu. The portions were not too small and not too big, just right. We came for our anniversary and when making the reservation noted this. We appreciated the waiters congratulating us when they seated us and at the end. Overall it was an ok experience but probably wouldn't go back again due to the food.

I don't think the meat quality is quite commensurate with the price, but they make up for it in quantity. I had the bone-in ribeye, a little tough, but it's about 18 ounces of meat (24 ounces with the bone) for $56. My friend got a filet mignon for around $50, which was good value considering the meat was good and 16 oz.- huge for a filet mignon.Here's my overall take- this is a great place to go with a group of friends who wants a relaxed, pleasant meal, especially if they are big eaters. If you're set on having the best steak available in New York, you should probably go elsewhere, but be aware that elsewhere, you may have to deal with surly waiters who rush you out after you've ordered your last item, a problem you won't encounter at Club A.",0,0,0,Will B.,"Bronx, NY",0,7,1

I would share that fatty goodness. It's a classic preparation and nothing new albeit yummy. Hanger steak is such an underrated cut of beef but cooked improperly can render it chewy. It was borderline here. Actually the filet mignon was better and I usually think tenderloin is overhyped. Next time I want the porterhouse for two because that butter waifs through the entire restaurant...The mac and cheese is BOMB and I know my mac. Awesome crust and surprisingly cheesy, not dried out.

All I know is, the food and experience was enough to get us back there again to celebrate his birthday! This time, we decided to go with porterhouse for 2, bacon (one each), creamed spinach and potatoes. For the most part, that's our standard order at any steakhouses! We asked for the porterhouse to be med rare and thats exactly how it came out! Though I normally like mine well done-for the sake of the birthday boy and learning to enjoy steak the right way, I had it and it was pretty good. Portion sizes of the sides were enough to leave you feeling full! After main course, we had complimentary dessert on the house- this seems to be a standard thing they do for everything but I did note that it was a birthday dinner so they wrote happy birthday on the plate!

3.0,12/30/2017,"Agreeing with Angela's review. Take a gander if you have a chance. My partner and I spent $170 on a prime porterhouse steak for 2, bacon, creamed spinach, potato hash and two drinks. Came in on a Thursday night by the way. I am extremely disappointed with my visit here. I did not have a reservation and I had no issue waiting for a table to open up. Everything felt extremely rushed. Let me begin;Walked in, asked the hostess if walk ins were ok and if so, how long would my partner and I have to wait for a table? The woman at the front said she couldn't talk to me and had to get her manager. Fine. The manager and I spoke and we decided that we'd get a table in 40 minutes. That was ok. Went to go order drinks, ordered the Johnny walker red label along with the Leo mojito. Leo mojito was mostly mint and club soda, I was disappointed to have spent $15 on that drink. Onto the bacon, the bacon was very good, fatty and charred. I would recommend this. Next, we ordered the prime porterhouse rare. When the steak came, it was way smaller than anticipated and the texture was fine. However, I would say that it didn't have much flavor. The texture was good until it became extremely chewy. This was a huge let down. Potato hash. They're just cubed potatoes mixed with bell peppers. I don't even know what we ordered. Don't get this. Cream spinach. Average. I really felt like cream spinach was necessary for this meal, but after getting it, I realized I could have lived without it. And for the service, I mean, honestly I think people who received great service were the ones who reserved in advance for an event or as a huge group. My partner and I felt ignored for most of the night, we had to wave down our waiter multiple times, we had gotten there at 8:30pm and got out by 11:00pm.We got the complimentary desserts at the end. Everyone receives it I suppose. The only reason why I'm giving this place 3 stars is because I'd like to make myself feel better for the amount of money I spent on tasteless steak. I wanted to like this steakhouse, I should have just went somewhere else.",9,8,6,Song L.,"Valley Stream, NY",199,179,113
3.0,12/28/2017,"Let's cut straight to the chase. I did not think the steak here was very good. I'm confused as to why they have 4.5 stars on Yelp, and am guessing it is likely because they tend to give many complementary things. Let's start from the beginning. I had booked this location for my parents' 25th anniversary, specifically indicating that we preferred upstairs seating, as I had heard good things about it. However, we were seated on the first floor in the red room (For everyone reading this, yes, I would recommend being seated upstairs. I went upstairs to use the bathroom and it is much prettier, especially during Christmas time.) For appetizers, we ordered: Crabcake: It comes with one crabcake and a beet and arugula salad. The crabcake was pretty meh. The crab was too scattered (I like it in more lumpy chunks) and it was of a glue-y texture and very mushy, which I was not a fan of. Usually I do really like crabcake, however, even one crabcake split amongst the three of us couldn't be finished. Also, might I say, I was surprised to find that the crabcake appetizer was just one small crabcake, considering it was the price of what an entree would be at many restaurants. No variation of texture at all in it. The beet and arugula salad was simple. Minimal dressing, which is fine. Nothing too much to say about the salad. 2.5/5Bacon: This one, I would recommend. It is thick cut and more like pork belly. Cooked perfectly crispy on the outer edges and tender on the inside. It is every bit of the savory saltiness you seek in bacon. It comes with the Club A Steakhouse sauce which is a red tangy sauce (okay, but not amazing). If anything, I thought the bacon was a bit on the small side. It's the same length as a regular slice of thick-cut bacon you'd buy in the supermarket (pre-shriveled), but about 4 of them put together in thickness. 4.5/5At this point, I had expected them to give us an appetizer of mushroom ravioli, as I had read that in many reviews. However, they did not. No stars deducted for that, though, as it was just something I was wondering if they'd give. For entrees, we ordered: Filet Mignon: Maybe this cut just wasn't right for me, but I found it to be very tasteless and lackluster. The inside, I will say was incredibly tender and at a stage where I was hungry, was like chewing velvet. However, a couple more bites and I couldn't eat it anymore. There was absolutely no richness of steak in it. It felt like I was just eating boiled meat at one point. Again, this might just mean that the filet mignon might not be the right cut of steak for me. However, even my dad said that he's had better filet mignon at other places. In addition, the outside of the filet mignon was rather dry. Just the inside lived up to the tenderness I was expected. I only finished a quarter of this. If you want to order filet mignon and you don't have the biggest appetite in the world and aren't sure if you'll be in love with it, I'd recommend you to just order the 10oz petite filet mignon rather than the 16oz one. 3/5Hanger Steak: I wasn't expecting too much out of the hanger steak. It neither disappointed me nor impressed me. I expected it to be a bit tougher to chew, but was hoping to be pleasantly surprised considering all the positive reviews (I wasn't). However, considering the price compared to the other dishes, it's not a bad choice if you're not a particularly big steak fan and are not that hungry. 3/5Bone-in Ribeye: This was not only the most expensive option, but also the worst out of the steaks we had. It was so much work not only to chew it, but also to cut through it. By appearance, it was cooked medium rare as the inside was the reddish-pink you would expect. However, it was incredibly tough to chew. Both of my parents agreed on this as well. My dad who usually loves ribeye, even just the kind you buy from your regular supermarket, could barely finish half his piece because he said it was just so much work to chew it. I dare say it wasn't as tender as the hanger steak, which was half the price of the bone-in ribeye. 1.5/5Creamed Spinach: It's a smaller portion than I had thought, about the size of your average soup bowl's worth of creamed spinach. However, I found it to be very delicious! It was definitely a nice break from the steak to have the creamed spinach as it was much creamier and had good flavor. 4.5/5If you want sauce, you have to ask for it. As I mentioned before, I'm not a particularly big fan of the Club A Steakhouse as it is a bit too goopy and tangy for me. However, I found that the steaks had no flavor whatsoever, so it might be a good idea to get that anyway. They also gave complementary dessert since it was my parents' anniversary. It was very nice of them and it came with 3 types of desserts: three creme puff like desserts, tiramisu, and cheesecake. The desserts weren't spectacular - I liked the creme puffs the most out of the three. Won't rate it, since it was complementary.",1,2,1,Angela S.,"Manhattan, NY",489,118,92

4.0,12/9/2017,This is a solid place to eat your steak. I have been here several times and each has been a pleasure. They place a single rose on the table that makes it a bit more homey and also feels kind of precarious during your meal. They always give you a free appetizer and it seems to be most of the time a mushroom ravioli. And they also give you a free selection of dessert.For the meal the ribeye is pretty good. You'll need to ask for sauce if you need it. The fries are pretty decent and slightly garlicky. The broccoli was also good. I'm not a fan of creamed spinach but others seemed to like this option.Overall a nice and not too overcrowded option for steak eating in the midtown area.,6,3,4,Mary P.,"Brooklyn, NY",602,1551,2818

Got 2 orders each of the shrimp and calamari. As well as 3 orders of crab cakes. You think this would be too much but we ate it all. Ordered two bottles of red wine - B.R. Cohn and Pessimist. Both were grrat but I likes the B. R. Cohn a little better.

We drove passed club a about two months ago and checked the reviews. When we saw it had 4 stars we added it to our go-to list. We made reservations for 7pm and arrived at about 6:50. Parking was great, right on second ave and only had to walk a few blocks over. When we stepped inside, I was impressed. The decor is so romantic. The fire place on the first floor is so home-y. The artwork and lighting really makes it an intimate affair. The upstairs has a great views of the streets on either side of the restaurant. We were seated rather promptly and greeted by our waiter. First step was ordering drinks. Then the bread came. Super fluffy and had a great variety. Raisin bread, onion bread, regular Italian slices, and flatbreads. We actually (or I) had the basket refilled three times with no questions asked. After checking out the menu we were ready to order apps and main dishes. For starters we went with the house salad and split an order of crab cake and an order of thick cut bacon. Everything was so tasty but the bacon really melted in your mouth. The salad was crisp and light. Loved the strawberries and Swiss cheese. Crab cake had a subtle crab flavor and was a nice consistently. For the main dishes my main squeeze went with the salmon. I went with the petite filet, medium rare. for sides we split a baked potato, charred broccoli and Mac and cheese. My steak was cooked to perfection. The Mac and cheese had an irresistible crust on top. The baked potato was the perfect consistency and delightfully plain. Sour cream was on the side. I think our waiter was shocked at how much food we ordered and consumed but he was very accommodating especially with the bread. When I made the reservation via opentable I noted that it was our anniversary. When we went to order dessert, our waiter informed us we had dessert coming on the house. They brought us a sampler of cheesecake, tiramisu and a puff pastry. The tiramisu was the best. Really delicious. I think the cheesecake could have been better. Didn't taste homemade.

1.0,11/8/2017,"I had made a dinner reservation for my fiance and I to celebrate my birthday this evening and it did not go as I had hoped. When I made the reservation on open table I had put in the comments that we were there to celebrate my birthday. I thought it was a nice touch to have ""Happy Birthday"" on the top of the menu. Everything started out right but then went downhill from there. I informed the waiter that I had a gluten allergy so that he was aware for the rest of the meal. He understood that I could not eat the bread and then proceeded to tell us that we would be receiving a complimentary mushroom ravioli. I have been to similar restaurants in the area that have gluten free ravioli so when it was placed in front of me I assumed I could eat it. After I had already eaten half of if did the waiter informed me that the ravioli was NOT gluten free. After my fiance and I had finished our meals I received a complimentary dessert. However, nothing in that dessert was gluten free. I appreciate the gesture, however it is not only frustrating, but also wasteful to put food in front of me that I cannot eat. After having told the waiter that I was gluten free I did not understand why food that I could not eat was being placed in front of me. I am gluten free because I have celiac disease. I cannot digest gluten and after eating just a portion of the ravioli I am now ill. The complimentary food is a nice gesture, but I would make sure your staff is better equipped to deal with different food allergies in order to avoid miscommunications, such as this, in the future. I sent most of the above message in an email to management before posting on review sites. It has been 4 days and I have yet to get a response. As an admin who works in the city it is unheard of to have to wait more than 24 hours for a response from a vendor. M fiance's feedback is that the price did not match the quality.

5.0,11/5/2017,"Club A has been on my to go list for about 3 years. I am not sure why it kept getting pushed back or replaced by a different steak house for so long as it is one of few steakhouses to have 4.5 stars on Yelp with a substantial amount of reviews. I went last week for my GF's birthday and it lived up to the hype. I was skeptical at first as how it could be so highly rated but can see why after the night. The service from the get go was on point. The host and waiter were very kind and professional. Ambiance and atmosphere is great for a date. Not too loud and squished up like most other steakhouses. We ordered 2 slices of the bacon which were massive but just as good as you would get from Lugers/Wolfgangs. It was a little salty however but some water should help with that. For steak, we got the Porterhouse for 2 as well as cream spinach with it. The cream spinach had a stem in it but I guess I was in a good mood and did not make a big deal out of it that night. The steak however was what you expect from a top notch steakhouse. Perfectly cooked medium rare and nice and sizzling. We did get a steak with some of the chewy tendon muscles running through it but it happens. Still it was tender as butter and satisfies the taste buds with every bite.There were some hiccups with the food but the reason I gave this 5 stars is because of the attention and human element. They knew it was my GFs birthday from the reservation I made and brought out a sampler dessert with a candle on top as well as took a picture and printed it out for us all free of charge!

Given the choices of ""name brand"" steakhouses in the area we wanted a place that was invested in the community and wasn't a revolving door of customers.The steaks that came to our table for the four of us, were all cooked and ordered to perfection. 4 different cuts 4 different temps and everything arrived at the same time hot.The service is old school and welcomed. The waiter is attentive to your every need and the support staff delivers everything promptly. You're never out of eye contact of your waiter and never waiting for anything.The sides were also table sharable sides and dropped at the same time as the entrees; all hot as well. The wine list was extensive although we didn't order wine. The drinks we did order were made perfectly and my wife made sure to ask our waiter to let the bartender know it was the best old fashion she's ever had prepared. Clearly the ingredients are hand crafted given the muddled cherries and quality of the drink.The deserts they brought out for us were just as good as the meals but were difficult to finish given all the food we had ordered prior.After leaving and later that night my friend realized they forgot their coats after finding the coat check tag. The restaurant was closed and not open on Sunday so he called to leave a message to have them shipped when the owner answered. After explaining he would be leaving the City on Sunday the owner actually met my friend to retrieve theirs coats; who does that? Not a chain restaurant I know that. This shows the family investment in their customers in my mind.This is highly recommended for those looking for high quality meals and service that's been missing for years.

3.0,10/23/2017,"Had the occasion to have dinner at this restaurant.  The ambiance is essentially old world (think Europe) with its dark wood walls) and updated just a bit with some red.  We went on a night when there was a three person jazz band playing, a nice touch.  Seated right near them and they were not overly loud.We got a few appetizers, the Club A salad, bacon, tomatoes and onions chopped, calamari and Canadian bacon.  All were pretty good.  The salad was probably just a little overdressed.  Then, before the steak, the kitchen sent out a mushroom ravioli -- unnecessary but a nice touch, not sure if that was meant to be a palette cleanser but with its thick cream, it has the opposite effect. We had the porterhouse.  It was good, but the cut seemed a little thinner than many other steakhouses.  Also, the dry aged taste did not really enhance the flavor and parts were still a bit chewy.  The steak was not unpleasant but it was just not a shining star.We received a complimentary plate of desserts -- cheese cake (good), tiramisu (ok, but a littel dry) and cream puffs (the shell a little oily).Overall, a pleasant experience with an attentive staff, but there are better places for a good steak.",0,0,0,K.

5.0,10/14/2017,"Today was my mother's 80th birthday and Club A Steakhouse treated her as if she were part of the family that brings out the best in you in every aspect of the word.  Rina, Alban and Steve of Cub A Steakhouse reminded me of a paradoxically melancholic fact: you can not pick your family but you can pick your friends in life.  Without realizing it, they all graciously resolved a dilemma I had for a few weeks.  How do I best celebrate my mother's birthday given her desire not to make a big deal given personal family issues we have been facing?  How can a group of people remind her to focus on strengths rather than perceived deficits?  Apparently, what seem to be relevant emotional issues have simple solutions that complete strangers can solve with the grace of a ballerina, sculptor, or artist whose ability to transcend silence embodies the artist's soul.When I first called Club A Steakhouse, I had the immeasurable privilege of speaking to Rina who gave me her word that she would accommodate my needs given my unique situation.  I needed to make my mother feel comfortable and seemingly surrounded by people even though we were a party of two.  Rina gave me her word she would help me.  Her integrity and dignity as one of the finest human beings I have every met convinced me I would stay with Club A Steakhouse.  Unbeknownst to her, I already had three tentative reservations in other restaurants and a possible gathering in my own home with fourteen persons.  However, her ability to understand and embrace a son's love for her son moved and inspired me.  I could not let her down and needed to be there.  Our server (note I do not call him a waiter) was Steve.  His dignity and elegant manner inspired me to re-evaluate how I could be a better person.  Attentive but never overbearing, he was wonderfully discreet yet disarmingly charming. Then came a quintessential gentleman named Alban who provided my mother with a surprise that made her decade.  A complimentary gastronomic amenity was incredibly well timed and enabled me to forget all my cynicism which is unfortunately an occupational hazard when you live in New York. Regardless of what people tell you, it is not necessarily an easy city to live in.  We are surrounded by opportunistic politicians who pillage, take and steal but do not know how to give unconditionally  They should receive training from the staff at Club A Steakhouse.I hope you will forgive a son's pride, but my mother deserves the best.  And Rina and Club A are the best.  She spearheaded the fruition of a reserved and dignified celebration given her inner beauty and ability to inspire my loyalty.  Few can do that.  On the phone she indicated ""she wanted to help me"" and all my expectations were surpassed.  Thank you again for making my mother's day so meaningful.  I could not have done it without you and the rest of the staff.To be sure, behind every great son is a great woman.......",0,1,0,A A.,"Rego Park, NY",33,323,0

The host was equally gracious. The restaurant is gorgeous - truly a beautiful atmosphere. It reminds me of a great supper club from ages past but still shiny new.

My favorite tables are upstairs where there is a gorgeous picture window overlooking this stunning tree. The wait staff is wonderful and attractive. Our waiter was Diego, who was so nice.

It was perfectly prepared and I savored every bite. I had the Mac and cheese as a side and, it too, was absolutely delicious and perfectly done. The deal came with a bottle of wine.

Sent it back the chef cut off burnt part and re-seared, then it's over cooked. I suppose the beef must be high quality, very thick cut. But because of the thickness If I were cooking it would use sous vide + pre/after searing rather than grill+broil, very difficult to get textures right. So it was overcooked. We had the steak re made but still dry and under seasoned. Plain meat taste and no seasoning in the center to bring up the beefy flavor. Maybe it should be marinated?

The upstairs is absolutely adorable...it has hanging lights that give the room a quaint romantic feel. Every table also had a single rose on it and candles. Someone quickly brought us menus, but then after that, we were forgotten about. That would probably be my one complaint...the service was kinda ehh.

The other couple had the filet mignon and said it was perfect. For sides, we had the macaroni and cheese and the mashed potatoes. I really liked the mashed potatoes. They were creamy and smooth and had a great homemade taste. The mac and cheese was good, but tasted better when you got a bite with the crunchy cheese top.

However, I learned that restaurant week is a major hit or miss with most restaurants and Club A is no exception. What is the point of restaurant week if the quality of the food is lowered to compensate for the lower price? If that's the case, just don't participate in restaurant week because you're doing your establishment a disservice otherwise. We were seated a little earlier than our reservation and the service was great throughout the meal, but the food was just okay. My beef tartare was flavorless and the chips that came with the dish were stale. My 10oz filet was slightly undercooked (asked for medium rare, came out rare). The creamed spinach was delicious (best dish of the night) but the mac and cheese was a little grainy. The profiteroles had a distinctly expired taste to them, like they were made a few days in advance and taken out of the fridge prior to serving. I left the profiteroles on the plate but the chocolate mousse underneath and the cream inside were great.

I would not picked this place on a regular but happy I was able to try it during restaurant week so I'd definitely add it to my Steakhouse list as my go to. The decor and ambiance is intimate and different then any Steakhouse I frequent and I love it especially the red walls. Service is outstanding and our server Demir was awesome and I love the outfits worn. Food was great also but I gave 4 stars as my filet was over cooked rather then the medium I asked for. It was more well done and try so I was sad. But my companions hanger steak was cooked perfectly and delicious. For appetizers we ordered the fried calamari and Apple wood smoked bacon, sides with whipped potatoes and Mac & cheese, main was the filet and hanger steak and dessert was profiterolles and tiramisu. FYI Tiramisu is to Die For!!! Like Die!!! Overall everything was fantastic again. I saw tons of tables order the porterhouse for 2 so that's my next.

5.0,8/10/2017,"This place is what Restaurant Week is all about. We both did the prix fixe and it was amazing. We started with the salad and calamari. The salad could have used a vinagrette, but was still enjoyable.  My boyfriend loved the calamari. We both ordered the 10 oz filet. I hate being the person who orders something difficult, but I ordered my steak between medium rare and medium and it was cooked to perfection. The Mac and cheese was phenomenal as were the mashed potatoes. Restaurant Week introduced us to this place and we will definitely be back for other special occasions. Two, high quality 3-course steak dinner in Manhattan, plus a cappuccino for just under $100 is a great value.

I must say somehow tonight wasn't that memorable for me, service is always excellent however. I felt the quality of the meat is less exquisite than my previous visit about a year ago. I ordered a porterhouse for two and ask for a medium rare. After waiting for 20 minutes, it finally arrives. Took the first bite, and the meat taste more like a medium well. It's tough and doesn't melt on your mouth right away. I guess a lot of their clienteles come for their restaurant week special as well.

5.0,8/9/2017,"What an amazing pre-birthday dinner here! I have NOT ONE negative thing to say about it. Very group and family friendly and amazing staff (we had JT who provided us with excellent service as well as plenty of fun and laughs). Loved having the live music on first floor, which really set the mood without affecting ability to have an audible conversation ;)All of the food was phenomenal. My mother and I both took advantage of the restaurant week menu which included an appetizer, entree and dessert for only $42; the others in our group ordered a la carte. My favorite app was my sister's salmon tartare. She and another shared the Porterhouse for 2 which was done PERFECTLY, seasoned just right and emanating the moisture and flavor from the butter in which it continued to cook after being served. My and my mother's 10 oz. medium rare filets were perfectly cooked, and my uncle's veal chop was definitely a winner. When ordering a la carte sides for the table, definitely get the crispy fingerling potatoes coated in aioli. Before lovingly embarrassing me with their rendition of the ""happy birthday"" song, the staff brought out a little variety plate of desserts (tiramisu, profiteroles and carrot cake) along with a full fruit platter. To top it off, they took our picture and had it developed and handed to me before we left! It was placed in a little frame with a lovely message of thanks from the owner.

We ended up just going for the regular menu. I had the NY Strip. My other two friends each had the ribeye. We shared the Bacon and tomato/mozzarella as appetizers. Creamy spinach, mac and cheese, baked potato, and mashed potato were sides. We got a bottle of red wine that was recommended by one of the waiters. The wine was absolutely exquisite. Went perfectly with our meal. Totally buying a few to keep at home. The steak was cooked to perfection. All the sides were delicious. I'm ordinarily a HUGE. Bacon lover but weirdly enough I wasn't a huge fan of the bacon appetizer. Staff was very friendly and welcoming. We recieved a complimentary dessert.

It has two levels of dining and I would describe the atmosphere as somewhat romantic. It's dimly lit which honestly wasn't my cup of tea. I couldn't really see the cook of my steak. For our entree we had filet mignon, hanger steak, Mac and cheese, and garlic fries. It was well cooked and I enjoyed their house seal sauce.

1.0,7/28/2017,"This place might be the reason I give up in Restaurant Week. Based on the reviews here and other reccomendations, my party of 5 made a reservation for dinner here today. On the surface it appears that the RW offering is a good value but the quality was so poor that it was just the opposite. For appetizers I had the beef tartare, which was completely bland. Others had bacon, which they liked and the calimari which was fine.For dinner we ordered the filet mignon, hangar steak, and salmon. My friend said the salmon was about fine, no better or worse than average. All of the steaks came out a) one grade over cooked for everyone b) with more of a char than is ideal for a steak dinner. One of us even sort of cut the inside of her mouth while chewing a particularly charred piece of steak. We are convinced that they must use worse grade meat or send their regular chef on vacation during restaurant week, because there is no way the food we received was worthy of these glowing reviews. For sides, we really enjoyed the fries and creamed spinach but the mac and cheese was bland and oily. For dessert, I had the profiterols, which were pretty good, light and airy, sweet but not too sweet. The other two desserts dissapointed my friends, especially the cheesecake which was cold enough to have recently exited a feeezer. Decor and atmosphere were great especially for couples. However, service was dreadful. Two of us needed to remind our waiters of our drink orders twice. The waiters also tried to pour water into my friends sprite twice. Just sloppy. Do not bother with this place. I would suggest that this restaurant either bring up the quality of their restaurant week offering or just stop participating.",3,2,0,Omar M.,"Jersey City, NJ",133,49,32
4.0,7/28/2017,"I took my girlfriend here for her birthday and didn't realize what a treat and wonderful experience we were in for. I made my reservations for 5:30 pm but my girlfriend didn't arrive till a little after 6:00 pm. The inside of the steakhouse is beautiful and gives you an old school romantic vibe. The moment I walked in, I picked up on how genuinely friendly the people who work there are. We were seated right away into a spot with a nice view and right next to the huge mirror. There was a rose and candle lit on our table. Shortly after, one server arrived with the bread. The raisin bread was very tasty. I didn't try the other breads. Our waiter was very helpful and descriptive when we asked him about the best options. I wanted to try the ribeye but decided that the Porterhouse for 2 would be a better option. We ordered mac and cheese and creamed spinach for sides. I was not disappointed when this huge sizzling plate of juicy steak arrived at our table!  This could have been for 3 people. The steak was huge! Our server showed us how to cook the steak on the sizzling plate, which was necessary because it was a little too pink for our liking! We ordered a medium well but it looked like a medium rare. Still, the steak was very juicy and tender! The crust on the steak stole the show! So delicious! The cream of spinach blew the mac and cheese out of the water. My homemade mac and cheese is much better than this stuff. The service was so excellent. Every time we took a sip of water, our server ran back to fill our glasses to the top! I've never seen anything like it!

5.0,7/23/2017,"Honestly in love with this place. I came here two yrs in a row on my bday. When making the reservation they'll ask u if it's for a special occasion, and they give you a customized menu that says happy birthday or happy anniversary etc. Definitely a nice touch. There's live jazz music in the first floor but we dined in the second floor both times. Such a nice romantic ambience with full length windows and trees lined with Christmas  lights. We had the crab cakes and a fat slab of bacon. Both were so good. The piece of unassuming bacon was so well cooked and flavored, I could eat that for breakfast lunch and dinner everyday. Probably one of the best raviolis I had was a mushroom ravioli that was complimentary (although I had it both times). The single ravioli was large enough for us to split and have a couple decent bites each. Still wish there were 10 more where that came from. Mac N cheese. Bomb dot com. I love when they have that crispy crust on top.I had the bone in ribeye both times, obviously medium rare (don't let anyone tell you otherwise), and it was so so good. I looked to the table besides me that got the porterhouse and I was wishing I got that just for the wow factor. But still the ribeye was perfect. Great char, great flavor, great texture. Not the best steak I ever had but top 5.Finally they ended with a complimentary dessert medley. There were cream puffs, cheesecake and ice cream with a cheesy ""happy birthday"" written in chocolate syrup. All things that I'm a sucker for. All in all, a very attentive waitstaff and a charming atmosphere. But even better food. All for a reasonable price for what we got.

3.0,6/14/2017,"3.5 RATING. This is my second time coming to club A. The first time I paid full price but this time I used a GROUPON that was $109 for 2 entrees, 2 apps, 2 sides and 2 desserts. A bottle of wine was also included, I chose red wine. I was charged $10 tax and then I tipped $20. Food - compared to the first time I came, this time the food fell a tad short. Im not much of a wine drinker but the wine was alright, wasn't too impressive and wasn't too bland. I then ordered a hangar steak, filet mignon, creamed spinach, Rosemary fries, bacon, steak tartare, and two tiramisu. Everything was delicious but I requested the steaks as medium rare and my filet mignon arrived HARD AS A ROCK. I had a hard time cutting it and eating it because it had the consistency of a piece of cardboard. That ruined my expectations for the rest of the meal. The creamed spinach was a tad too watery and dripped all over my plate. I was not given a spoon so I had to make do with a fork. Ambiance/ decor - This does resemble 50 shades redroom but with a more photos and older people. I really like the ambiance, it's a great place to bring a girl for a romantic date. Value - had I not bought the GROUPON the meal would of been more expensive, so I'm glad a GROUPON was available! I estimated that I saved about $40-$50. Service - compared to my visit 2 years ago, the service was not so great this time around. My last visit had me feeling warm and welcome but this time felt very cold and informal. I believe my waiter was Gene, he was more accommodating to the surrounded tables compared to us which did not go un-noticed (Both tables got mushroom ravioli complimentary of the chef, and another table got ""extra asparagus"" just because). Waiting for the check also took eternity, I flagged someone down to get me it only for them to forget so I had to ask AGAIN. That took another 10 minutes. I wasted 15 minutes waiting for a check when I sat 10 feet away from the register. Overall, I don't think I'll come back unless it's through a GROUPON special because it isn't worth it to me. What I thought was going to be a great experience based off of my visit 2 years ago fell short.",17,15,16,Michelle S.,"Brooklyn, NY",659,297,583

4.0,5/13/2017,"5 stars for service, 3 stars for food. From start to finish, service was perfect. It wasn't too annoying where the server was hovering above you but our waiter was just attentive enough and could be reached if necessary. You start off with basket of various breads and a whipped butter, all which I liked and couldn't find fault in. You're then served with a complimentary mushroom ravioli, which seems to be the standard at more high end steakhouses. We then got our steaks and sides. We ordered the rib eye and the petit filet mignon as well as the charred broccoli and potato hash. The petit filet mignon was overcooked and I didn't particularly enjoy it so much as I did the rib eye. The sides were good, but nothing special. We ordered a bottle of merlot upon the recommendation of our server, which I liked but another thought was too sweet. Finally finished with a complimentary dessert dish of tiramisu, cream puffs and cheesecake adorned with a candle and and a chocolate message. Throughout the meal we were congratulated on our anniversary and we were presented with a complimentary printed out photo of ourselves that night at the end, which I thought was a nice touch. Definitely a good special occasion type of night, and I left happy.",1,0,1,Roxanne O.,"Freehold Township, NJ",94,650,866

My mother in law asked for hot water and Franklin mocked her for ordering hot water, like hot water was a special order that was never heard of.

Started with some cocktails the vodka Martini made very well three olives the way I like it. We then had some appetizers the fried calamari hot and crispy, the thick cut bacon rich and meaty and the steak tartare with fresh made potato chips. We then went with the filet Mignon  for three of us and the hanger steak. For sides we tried the creamed spinach, the mashed potatoes, the Mac and cheese and the garlic fries. All the sides were excellent and more than enough to share. The wait staff was attentive but not smothering Steve and the rest of the team made our dinner very pleasant. The wine list has many reasonably priced choices.

4.0,4/30/2017,"A friend recommended us to go celebrate my birthday there since 2 weeks before Peter Luger had left us a disappointment for another occasion so we vow not to go back.  Parking:  Not that easy. Dinner reservation was made at 5pm.  We circled around closed for an hour.  First we love the atmosphere, deco and great helpful service from all the staffs.As starters:  We ordered the bacon which was so so good.  My husband and I will go back just for that only. The crabcakes and salad was delish and definitely recommended. All we tasted was crabmeat less fillers. The fingerling potatoes were good and not greasy.   They were baked as I must ask prior to ordering.  My husband loved it.   The asparagus were delish and loved the toasted almonds on top. It was crunchy.  I loved it.    Steak: We ordered the Porterhouse for 2.  The steak was cooked as ordered medium rare so we got.  But it was not flavorful and didn't melt in our mouth. Maybe we lay too high expectations as our friend said their steak melted in their mouth. We didn't get that. So that was the damper to the experience.   Otherwise they would deserve a 5. Desert:  Since it was birthday we were offered complimentary deserts:  tiramisu, cream puffs and chocolate cake. It was nicely and quitely served to me on the table with a happy birthday greeting which I appreciate as I did not wanted like an announcement.   I thought that was very professional and well presented. Overall it was a great experience for us. I and my husband were impressed with their starters and probably try other steak type.",1,0,0,Jenny G.,"Brooklyn, NY",68,354,2147

Their bartender was charming and engaging but small talk with us never distracted her from mixing and serving guests at the bar.  Our waiter slowed the meal down as we wanted to talk and finish our cocktails before getting into the meal.  We never felt rushed. We never felt ignored either. Water glasses were constantly filled, no assumption we would order additional wine as the bottles were running low (but ready because we did), all food (steak & sides) served in a single instant, management stopping by to check on us too.  Impressive service to go with a really delicious meal at a fair price with live soft music in a very attractive setting.  Yes I'll be back!",0,0,0,Phil C.,"Manhattan, NY",4,37,11

Any soup I have tried was so tasty.  When it comes to the steak, without any exaggeration, they make the best steak in the city, perfectly cooked medium rare..on the top of it, they use prime quality aged beef. Pick any of their sides, you will not be disappointed, they are fresh and so tasty. They gave complimentary dessert which will make your mouth water, very fresh and so yummy!

The steak tar tar was shocking delicious. It contains capers which added a very fresh taste. Entrees: hangar steak and salmon.  The hangar steak was well cooked medium rare but overall it's just a tough cut of meat. It came with a sauce that was way too salty. The salmon... I don't know what I was thinking ordering fish at a steakhouse.  The fish was cooked well,  but nothing mind blowing. Sides: Creamed spinach and whipped potatoes were both delicious. Dessert: I can't even remember which means it wasn't outstanding in any way. Again,  this was a Groupon experience. Service should've been better regardless.

3.0,2/25/2017,"Spontaneously stopped by on a Wednesday night with a 21:30 reservation for the restaurant week deal. We arrived at 21:00, thirty minutes ahead of schedule. The restaurant had more than enough tables to serve 3-4 more parties on the first floor. The second floor is much prettier since it had a window and it was nicely lit.I was hoping to be amazed by the steak, but I found it to be rather mediocre. The exterior of the steak was closer to the overcooked spectrum while the inside of the steak was medium rare as requested. I also foolishly ordered a Caesar salad for my appetizer. It was literally just leaves and some cheese. I had one crouton, just one crouton... and no anchovies. I'm not going to say the food was bad, but it was underwhelming considering the atmosphere of this restaurant. My S/O ordered the steak tartare for his appetizer. I WISH I HAD ORDERED THAT INSTEAD. So there's this raw-ish piece of meat with a raw egg on top and waffle chips. It was the best thing (in my opinion) that I had through the entire dinner-- and if I were to come back, it would be for this!! I'm going to end my comments on food here because I like ending with the best part ;) On the service side.....The waiters were really nice.

5.0,2/22/2017,"What a great night. Was in town with a bunch of 8th graders and Four of us out of town dads brought our 8th grade son's here for a special father/son dinner during our visit. Owner introduced himself and shared his family story, the history of the restaurant and about his 3 own sons. A couple of his grandkids were even there. You can tell he was a family man himself. We kicked off our evening with a few extra thick Smoked Applewood Bacon appetizers. They were not fatty and delicious. We also had Caesar Salad's which were nothing out of the ordinary but were fresh and cold. In between our main course the owners graciously provided our table with a Mushroom Ravioli in a light cream sauce. Not a big fan of mushrooms but I did enjoy it and the other dads licked their plate....tells me it was good. For our main course I had a 10oz Petite Filet Mignon cooked to my perfection and it was out of this world - juicy and tender with great flavor. My son ordered the double cut T-Bone Veal Chop which was odd since he has no clue what that was so I let him go for it. His 90lb frame demolished it. I think he found another steak to add to his list of favorites. We all had sides (broccoli, cheesy mac & cheese & fries for some of the kids). The Broccoli is seasoned with Garlic and Chili. It was cooked to perfection...not soggy and mushy,  I like my veggies a little crisp. I didn't really taste the chili but the garlic was surely present. My son is finicky and he ate his Mac & Cheese without comment or complaint so it must have been good. The owner left us in good hands with his son who really took care of us and our boys. He topped off our evening with complimentary desserts and a fruit bowl. By this time i was in a food comma so i cannot comment on the dessert but our table conquered it all.

Let's just say this was not $40+ steak....this was $15 steak at best. The mashed potatoes were tasteless. The asparagus was weirdly white-ish and soft and had no crunch. This was the first time my date and I had ever left steak half untouched. Underwhelming, disappointing, live music was annoying (at one point the singer was singing ""do doo do doop"" instead of actual words). Such a waste of a dinner/money.

It was delicious, perfectly smoked. - entree: both got filet mignon, medium rare & it was perfect!

My friend got the spinach which was apparently amazing, but i don't tend to eat creamed spinach...so I took her work for it, was good though.- dessert: tiramisu was good, but a bit dense for tiramisu and didn't have much of a coffee flavor to it, definitely need to soak for longer, but still solid.

They served steak sauce to eat with the filet which tasted like ketchup. My experience with a good filet is you don't need any sauce but this was so burned I had to put sauce on to make it somewhat edible. It really tasted like a bad cheeseburger.

For a steakhouse, I wasn't impressed. I came here with my bf for restaurant week special for our anniversary. The wait for EVERYTHING WAS EXTREMELY LONG. Waited 40mins to be seated(given that we did show up earlier than our reservation, but the host said she'd be back with us briefly. Could've just told us to come back and I would've been fine with it). Also took forever for each dish to come out -- except when the manager noticed I wasn't pleased with my medium rare steak and agreed it looked too dry and well done...the second steak came out in a couple of minutes. (Makes me wonder if it was preprepped or was declined by different table.) Even then the second filet mignon wasn't satisfying...it was medium rare center but the exterior was over cooked cause the crust of the meat poked my inner cheek and I bled a bit. I didn't want to be bothersome and just nodded when the manager came by again. Think my fav part was the creamed spinach (a bit salty), but there's better elsewhere - i.e. Capital Grille in financial district. Setting is very cramped. But does give a nice warm feeling. Rose & Candlelight dinner. Love the live music, the musicians made the wait a bit less irritating. It was nice of them to write happy anniversary on the dessert and the waiter to say it. I guess a lot of people come here for anniversary celebration since they gave us menus saying 'happy anniversary' on top.

However, since I still wanted to come, and I still wanted to try this place out: I decided to make my way here this week. Upon entry, I was immediately greeted and the hostess inquired about my name on the reservation. She also asked for my coat, which was appreciated. I'm pretty simple and went with the Filet, potato puree, and mac and cheese.

I asked for sautéed spinach instead of the creamed and the server at first said he could not substitute. After a look of disgust, he obliged. They forgot about us and left us sitting there for, what felt like an hour, and did not bring our deserts for ages. The maitre d. certainly made up for it with his baritone apologies and complimentary glass of wine, albeit the wine wasn't as good as the malbec that came with the Groupon; perhaps a glass of cognac would have been a better gesture considering there was a storm outside  that I trekked in it to get to the steakhouse  ;-).

1.0,1/21/2017,"Just got done eating dinner here, honestly not sure where to begin. Having seen the 4.5 star rating and over 2000 reviews, I figured I was going to receive a great meal, to say the least. To make a long story short, the meal was a disappointment. We ordered three 16oz filets, 2 ordered medium and 1 ordered medium-rare. They brought us our steaks, and to my surprise there was also a plate of their signature ""steak sauce."" Turns out, it was a plate of cocktail sauce. Strange, but alright more power to you. As I began to cut into my filet...and then cut into my filet some more, as this turned out to be a process, my anticipation to try my first bite began to grow. But then I noticed that the steaks looked a bit well done. The medium steaks came out well done and the medium-rare was cooked medium. Now for the taste, simply put it was dry and lacked flavor. If you blind folded me and had me try this filet vs a filet from Outback Steakhouse, Chilis, Longhorn Steakhouse, etc. I would not have noticed much of a difference. Be warned, not fooled, you're better off going for a nice steak somewhere else.",0,0,0,Danny G.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",0,2,0

1.0,1/21/2017,"I would not go back here to dine if you paid for my meal. It was one of the worst dining experiences I've ever had. Here's a quick rundown:SEATING.  If you are a couple hoping for a romantic evening, definitely go elsewhere. The only type of seating that they have for couples is seats that are right next to other couples. So my wife and I were sandwiched in between two there couples at their tables. The distance between each of our tables was less than 12 inches. I had to turn sideways just to sandwich between the tables. One of the couples talked so loudly that we heard their entire conversation the whole meal.SERVICE.  Absolutely unequivocally the WORST. Our waiter showed up 5 minutes after we were seated to offer us water and the wine list. I told him I wanted a Coke which he never brought. He came back for our full order about 10 minutes later. While we ordered he seemed completely distracted. Our food came about 25 minutes later. . My wife and I both ordered steaks but their were no steak knives. We waited for another five minutes and had to track the waiter down to get them. When he brought the knives back, he asked, ""How's the food?"" Well.....we don't know because we don't have knives. Of course I just thought that. I didn't say it. I just smiled and took the knives and began to eat. We never saw the waiter again. My wife had to get up to go ask the waiter to bring our check. FOOD. Definitely the best part of the experience. The food really was good. It wasn't the best steak I've ever had, but it was pretty darn good. My wife said the Asparagus was some of the best she's ever had. And the creamy spinach was excellent. Her filet was pretty good, although they didn't butterfly it as she had requested. My ribeye was good. It was a little over cooked, but the taste was really good. This place wasn't busy on the night we went. So, I shutter to think at how bad the service would be on a night when they had lots of customers. I think there are much better options in NYC for good steak.",0,0,0,Tate C.,"Wake Forest, NC",0,18,1

Oh before I start the previous reviews made me come to this place and try it out not disappointed at all I must say. From when we entered they ask if they can take our coats and hang it in their coat room, which I found very courteous of them. They sat us upstairs it was so nice and clean the ambiance was amazing my fiance loved it. Our waiter was Tony which was a sweetheart he was very respectful and helped me out with ordering my food and gave me good options. We ordered some wine called decoy I believe which went awesome with our steaks. Appetizers we had fried calamari and lobster bisque very tasteful.  Entrée we had filet mignon and prime rib eye both medium omggg, to die for so freaking good with sides of whipped potatoes and creamy spinach.  I could hardly eat my steak had to take mines home. They gave my fiance and complimentary dessert we shared it lol. They took a picture of us with a professional camera and they printed it for us which i thought was so generous of them. Met with the owner Bruno who was so nice and respectful.  Overall this restaurant is worth it worth the price and time. I will be coming back again with on of my best friends to celebrate our anniversary of a long term friendship.  My fiance enjoyed his food and the service I did too.

4.0,1/6/2017,"This is one of the best steakhouses I've been to. The food is delicious with excellent cuts of meat and the decor is warm and inviting. I came here with my wife for my birthday dinner, and club A went the extra mile to make my birthday feel extra special! The first thing we noticed when we entered is the warm and cozy ambiance, the fireplace near the hostess stand and the red walls that looked beautiful with all the Christmas decor. We were shown to our table, and presented with a menu that had ""Happy Birthday"" printed at the top. We ordered a bottle of excellent wine as suggested by our server, which was poured into a decanter so that it could breathe. On to the food. For the appetizers we got the thick cut bacon and the lobster bisque. The bacon was deliciously decadent, smoky, salty and meaty. The lobster bisque was light and not as creamy as in other places, which I felt is a good thing considering I was going to pig out on a massive steak soon. For the mains we got the filet mignon and the club A burger. The filet was tender and perfectly cooked, everything I'd expect from that cut. The burger was enormous and tasty, and came with a large side of fries. We also ordered a side of mac and cheese which was quite good. The little thoughtful touches at Club A that they do for a special occasion were the ones I remember most. From the special menus to everyone wishing you a happy birthday, they do make an effort to please. At the end we got a dessert that came with a candle and a happy birthday message on it. And after that they took a picture of us that was printed out and given to us on a personalized card, for us to  keep as a memoir of the special dinner. The only thing that keeps me from giving a perfect rating is the server, who was quite pushy. We arrived a bit later in the evening, and might have been one of the last set of tables, but he kept rushing us thorough the meal and hovering around our table when we just wanted to spend a few quiet moments together.

My filet mignon was cooked PERFECTLY, I always ask for no pink, chef was able to cook medium well for me with no pink and the outside was perfectly browned not dry at all. My husband said his prime ny strip was also perfect. The sides (big enough for sharing but on the smaller side of sharing) we ordered : whipped potatoes, asparagus, mac and cheese they  were all delicious. 3 sides shared between us were perfect but we were stuffed (we are slim people).

AnniversaryThis place is romantic, perfect for celebrating with loved ones or a special date.Our menu read ""Happy Anniversary"" at the top which is a lovely touch.

To begin, we didn't know they open at 5pm (our reservation was for 5pm) and wanted to be early. Upon arrival there was a family waiting outside. I attempted to open the door and then read the time as 5pm for opening. The door was suitably locked and I waited outside in the cold with the other family. Another group arrived and proceeded towards the door, I kindly said ""It's not opened yet."" They too joined us in waiting outside (all of us had reservations for 5pm). Fast forward a couple minutes later another group appeared and attempted to open the door, as I was notifying them that it was closed the door opens and an employee lets them in and did NOT acknowledge all of us that had been waiting outside. So the group that walked in last were seated first... the family that was waiting outside first were seated after us. Employees should acknowledge their patrons waiting outside and ask for their names so that patrons are seated accordingly.",0,0,0,Samantha M.,"New York, NY",54,12,11
2.0,12/26/2016,"This low review is primarily for the experience and service. The food itself speaks for itself and is really good.I came here for Christmas eve dinner with my family that had just flown in from California. We had a reservation at 9 PM and were seated a few minutes after the hour.  To say the service sucked would be, unfortunately an understatement. It was such a disappointment to the start of the evening especially after seeing the 4.5 stars from almost 2000 reviews.It really started with the super slow service. Surprisingly on Christmas Eve night, there were a few empty tables. And being a quality steakhouse and it being the day before a holiday, it would be any normal person's assumption that waitstaff is properly staffed to the demand of the night.I think they might've overstaffed. I had three or four different people attend to my table in the first 20-30 minutes. While this would normally be nice, it's not when we aren't being asked for our orders or when it's difficult to just get water served. I asked for 5 waters with straws. FYI Club A only has those skinny red straws that you usually use for coffee. They don't actually have real straws. Then the waters that my sister and I got had funny floating matter in it. We also wanted the small cocktail type of glasses for my niece and nephew and one of the waiters have no idea what kind of glassware the steakhouse owned. He literally brought over wine glasses for the kids because it was the only ""smaller"" glass then the glasses that were already on the table. I had to explain to him what kind of glass the steakhouse owned and he brought it the second time around.Another server finally brought around the decanter for the wine bottle I had brought to the restaurant. Mind you, I had to ask him to open the bottle and then further ask him to Decant it. He must've walked by and attended our table a couple times and I felt he ignored that there was a bottle on the table. FYI corkage is $40! While he was decanting our wine and serving it, I decided to ask him to take our order given how slow the service had already been in the beginning of the night. He said to go ahead and tell him what we wanted. After my brother and I said our orders for entrées ( no appetizers), he said he can't remember all of this and needed his notepad. There were three adults at the table, why would he say he wanted to take our order if he couldn't even remember two entrées??He finally took our orders on his notepad and then our steaks came out. And one of the two steaks was not prepared the way we had asked. He said he put it in the order but the cooks failed.I spoke to the manager that night, Argon (spelling?). I told him about the terrible experience and service from his staff and he was nice enough to comp our corkage and bring out some complementary desserts.

Wait staff was courteous and professional and refilled our water promptly many times. They also helped us celebrate a birthday and remembered a gluten allergy for the whole meal. The music alternated between a band playing downstairs and a prerecorded album. Unfortunately the way the music from the band was being transmitted through the speakers made it sound like someone was banging on a wall whenever they would hit some instrument (couldn't tell because I couldn't see) but it was very annoying until the prerecorded music came back on and my brain could breathe.

My steak arrived and looked great, but a little charred. It looked much better than it tasted, which was like charred meat. Even though it was between medium and medium rare, it was somehow dry and overcooked. I was very disappointed, as I've made far better steaks myself. The porterhouse was slightly better but again, nothing special whatsoever. At $56 for a steak, I expected it to be perfectly cooked and juicy. It was a bummer.

OMFG!! Service was OK, still don't know our waiter's name since he never mentioned it. He doubted that I can actually eat a porterhouse for 2 on my own cause that was what I ordered and finished!!! I totally shut him up, he said that if I could finish the entire steak then he would throw in free dessert but I think they already do that anyways. Bacon was salty but delicious. Porterhouse was tough and chewy. My friend's steaks were also tough and chewy as well. I'm still recommending Peter Lugers Steakhouse!!!!!! Fries were over fried and hollow!! Blah As for the dessert, the Tiramisu and cheesecake was good and the cream puffs were very bland. Overall, I'm not impressed at all!!!",0,0,0,Jenny L.,"Manhattan, NY",140,36,149
1.0,12/7/2016,Awful experience. Cheesy ambiance and worst service. When you order a steak a certain way and return it you would expect they make it a priority to fix it? Not here. My wife was done with her meal and our sides were cold before it came back. Also the $200 bottle of wine we wanted to drink with our meal sat in the decanter waiting for someone to pour it but nah. He seemed to go out for a smoke or something. Awful experience. Never again!,0,0,0,George M.,"New Port Richey, FL",0,3,0

5.0,12/3/2016,"Hands down, the BEST service/experience ever. The food they served could've tasted like complete doodoo and I would still give this place at least 3 stars because their service is just that amazing.Tip: this place has an incredibly romantic vibe to it lol (so great for dates...not so much when you're there for a birthday dinner with your little brother). I was seated upstairs, and they had a dim, candle lit setting, red leather seats, and outside the window, you could see trees adorn with blue lights. While downstairs, I noticed that they had live music (a cello or something of that sort).The menus had ""Happy Birthday"" printed on it, which was a really nice touch. We got the porterhouse for 2 (medium rare), bacon, creamed spinach, and mac & cheese. I enjoyed the steak but it was too over-cooked for my brother's liking (he says he has had better). The bacon was good. The sides were surprisingly good/flavorful because in my experience, generally, steakhouses have bland, underseasoned sides. They gave us a free dessert sampler (cheesecake, creampuff, tiramisu, and something else I think) because it was his birthday and everything tasted great (especially since its free~). It was really generous of them to offer a whole variety of desserts (rather than a whipped cream/icecream thing with a candle like peter luger lol).AND, what really blew my mind was that at the end of the meal, a hostess came up and took a picture of us, printed it, and made a birthday card with a message. likeeee ..... ?!??!??!?!#$%^!!??!?!?! amazing. Conclusion: great romantic spot, BEST EXPERIENCE EVER, good food.I would definitely come back for a special occasion because their service makes me feel super special :')",2,1,2,Karman L.,"Flushing, NY",331,43,11

The filet mignon was charred and dry the first time we got it but they switched it and it was excellent afterward when they did not char it as much. The creamed spinach and mac and cheese were excellent. The tiramisu was soft and decent and cream puffs were mediocre.

We wanted to try something other than Ruth Chris, Morton's or Capitol Grille.  Our waiter, who unfortunately I don't remember his name had the personality of an old man. He was young and really needs to put a smile on his face.  Also, the place needs a major facelift.  Get rid of all of the red walls!  Very stuffy atmosphere, not a fun vibe.  Menu was meh - nothing outstanding.  Steak was awful, dry and blah.  I really have nothing nice to say about this place, not sure why it gets good reviews when there are so many other steakhouses in NYC.",0,1,0,Beth P.,"Bergen County, NJ",5,195,167

We ordered the bacon strip for app and my girlfriend ordered the filet while I had a strip steak with a side of mac and cheese. The bacon strip was like what it sounds like lol, a strip of bacon. It was good a little in the salty side. Our steaks were so good!! They cooked not our steaks to the correct temperature (both medium).

Appetizers such as fish royal and steak tartare were excellent. When it came to the meat itself (the sole reason why you come to a steakhouse) i and my fiancé ordered the petite filet mignon. The server did not ask us how we liked it which I remember reading here on a yelp post, so I made sure to tell him that I wanted it cooked medium. He said they cook it where it's pink so I said ok the more undercooked the better. Low and behold, the filet mignon came out charred for us both and I immediately told the server. He then said to cut the inside of the steak which was a faint pink but surely, not medium like I had asked. I was a little disappointed...at the end of our meal they took a photo of us and gave it to us in a card with complimentary desserts which was a nice touch. But this isn't enough to make me come back. I assumed with all of the great yelp reviews this place would have been a diamond in the rough.

I called ahead to make the restaurant aware our reservation was for a special occasion.The ambience at Club A is perfect for a romantic dinner.  Think warm red tones and dimly lit dining, with tables spaced just far enough apart that the dining experience is intimate. Initially, our experience was phenomenal.  The hostess sat us at an amazing table that definitely made a favorable first impression. The hostess and staff downstairs were incredibly friendly.  They offer a lot of nice little touches, like a ""happy anniversary"" titled menu, complementary dessert and they even take a photo that they give you at the completion of your meal.The food unfortunately was not all that memorable.  The only expectation I have of a steakhouse is that if I am going to drop $50 or more on a steak, the waiter or a member of the staff should check back immediately that the preparation is correct.My wife had the filet minion and was quite happy with hers.  I had the ribeye and ordered it medium, but it was definitely well done.  It became more apparent as the night progressed that they were short on wait staff.  I've seen a few other recent reviews complaining of over cooked steaks. I suppose some would question why I didn't just send it back.  I hate doing that because it throws off the pace of the meal for everyone else at the table, especially if others are happy with theirs, complicated more so when there are sides in the mix and already served.  Great steak house.  Warm and friendly staff.  Amazing ambience.  The food itself needs a little more attentiveness.",0,0,0,M Z.,"Boston, MA",0,44,0
5.0,10/23/2016,"This was our 2nd time visiting Club A Steakhouse. The first time we dined here about 2 years ago we sat upstairs and enjoyed our dinner. This time we were asked if we preferred up or down when we arrive. A jazz duo were playing set up right between the bar and dining area downstairs so we choose to sit downstairs and were promptly seated at a nice table for two. I liked the red clubby look to the decor, a little bit different than my memory of upstairs (which was also very nice). We ordered 2 pieces of bacon to start (very good, large, smoky and tasty), the porterhouse for 2 (ordered medium though it came out withe a medium rare thing sticking out of it on the sign, we just let the meat cook a bit on the plate as we served to ourselves and it was actually perfect for our taste). We had an order of the garlic rosemary fries and each had a drink (he a martini, me a glass of red wine). The entire meal was very enjoyable not to mention the service was great and the complimentary dessert sampler was delicious.

We looked around and saw that dish on most of the tables.  That was followed by a mushroom ravioli in a lovely cream sauce.

Very tender and flavorful. A little too much char on the hanger and the veal was too rare and I was not a fan of the texture.for a side to split we ordered the Brussels sprouts since it was one of the options not smothered in butter or cream.

EXCELLENT.  Super fresh and extremely tasty!Dinner:I do not eat steak so I had the crab cake and it was one of the best I've had.  Very meaty.  Very fresh with not a lot of filler at all.  My husband at the T-bone steak which he was was EXCELLENT.  He ordered it medium rare but because he came on a hot plate with butter it cooks a little more as it sits in here and so mid way into it was more medium.  The temp changed.  Still very delicious.We were BLOWN away by the service of this restaurant and how they really made this a special night for us since they knew we were celebrating something.  They threw in a cappuccinos, a small appetizer (mozzarella and tomato), and a big dessert platter for my husband and I to share.  Oh and also an extra drink on the house for my husband!  They also took a profile with their camera, printed it, and it it in a little card for us to take him thanking us for dining at their restaurant.These little touches go a LONG way and I thank the restaurant for making these little additives as they make for a great and memorable night.Thanks again and please keep it up!",2,0,1,ThamAndrew R.,"Jersey City, NJ",83,39,79

4.0,9/1/2016,"The beef tartare tasted amazing with the raw egg yolk on top of it. It was really flavorful but not overwhelming. The chips gave it a crunch to it. The applewood smoked bacon tasted pretty good too but was a bit too smoked on one side. As for the steaks, they were both DELICIOUS!!! It was cooked medium rare, the way we asked for. As for the sides, the mashed potato and spinach were decent. As for the desserts, the tiramisu tasted better than the cream puffs. Overall, great steakhouse!! What makes this a better steakhouse is that the chef actually alter a customer's well done steak to medium well and told the customer they cooked the steak to medium well so it will be juicy. When chefs know what they are doing, they will not cook something bad.",2,0,1,Susan L.,"Manhattan, NY",318,452,827
3.0,8/25/2016,"Been here twice. The first time was so good, I thought it was going to become my favorite NY Steakhouse. The food was perfect and the service was even better, and the ambiance on the second floor by the window?? Forggetaboutit!!. 5 stars. But then I went back again during restaurant week. Filet Mignon was chewy--not because it was undercooked or over cooked...it was just a disappointing quality of beef. The creamed spinach side came out cold. The service was just ok--not bad, but not special like the first time. Peeve: They cleared everyone else's dinner plate while one person was still eating. Not the worst crime, but you don't do that with fine dining. I probably wouldn't have been so disappointed the second time, if the first time hadn't been so exceptional. I'm giving this 3 stars, and at some point I'm probably going back for one more dinner in the hopes that maybe it was just a bad one-off night.",0,0,0,Eddie M.,"Manhattan, NY",2,23,8

They seated us in the back where the window and lights were. I loved the decorations. We started off with the steak tartar. It was relatively fresh and pretty tasty. For entrees, we tried the hanger steak and filet mignon. The hanger steak was a bit over cooked for what I requested which was medium rare. The filet mignon had the right amount of flavor and perfectly cooked. My favorite part was their desserts. The cheesecake was so rich and fulfilling.

For appetizers we ordered the Tomato And Buffala Mozzarella - 5 starsWe were also given complimentary mushroom ravioli. I found the ravioli to be absolutely delicious.

I don't really eat fish or meat but the Sea Bass was cooked well and seasoned well - 4 starsMy BF ordered the Prime Dry Aged Rib Eye made well done (he hates bloody meat). He absolutely loved the steak. The steak was very flavorful and deliciously fatty in his opinion. He didn't even use the sauce he had ordered. - 5 Stars For our sides we ordered: Baked potato: Was well cooked but not that flavorful - 3.5 starsMac & Cheese: Was AMAZING!

First off the wine was so good and reasonably priced we had two bottles between us. The menus had happy birthday written across them, which was a nice touch. Our appetizers crab cakes and a beet salad, we could tell,  both were full of rich delicious ingredients. When we got our steaks each was done to exactly how we like it. I like mine kind of rare. The waiter suggested rare plus, which I never heard that term, but is between medium rare and rare, and was perfectly executed! Man and the sauces, bordelaise and bearnaise both added so much depth to the dinner. I could go on about the sides. They were very good, but they brought us a complimentary dessert for our birthday which was so darn good, and took a photo of us that we will cherish forever. Class act these guys are.

Loved the ambiance and there was a jazz trio quietly playing in the background. Everything's a shade of red as you've probably seen in the pics already and it looks amazing.We ordered 2 cocktails both of which were phenomenal, i forget their names pardon me, blame the alcohol. For appetizers, we got the beef tartare with a raw egg on top which was heavenly and also the fresh crispy fried calamari which was really good as well.For main course, we got the steak (medium rare) with the mac and cheese and creamy spinach both of which were A++ delish. Also got the salmon which was cooked to perfection and was really good.For dessert (struggling for air by now and so full), we got the tiramisu and the cream puffs, couldnt finish either but were so good. Though they dont the menu online for the restaurant week, it is quite similar to the pics that have been posted before.Overall, it was a great experience. They brought out special birthday cakes/anniversary cakes for people celebrating, snapped pictures and gave it to them in a greeting card which is nice.

Not at all deserving of the reviews seen here on Yelp, makes me question the reviews. The creamed spinach was a recommended popular dish - please don't order it. Tasted like over salted, sorry excuse of a side dish. Felt like I wasted my steakhouse night. Would have gone elsewhere had I seen a real review. Don't even get me started on the decor.

They obviously do very good business because it was full when we arrived at 7pm and quick turnovers. The service was very good, very adequate but almost mechanical because feels like they do it so many times with the high turnover. The RW menu has good selections. We had the calamari (really good) and steak tartare which were served with potato chips which is odd for a restaurant of this standard. The tartare was quite plain. I had the filet mignon which was okay, thought it didn't have much taste either. My husband had the hanger steak (1st time) which was tough and chewy. We asked the server and he said that's the way it's suppose to be (so that was disappointing dish). Dessert was cheese cake and profiteroles both again very standard nothing special. We had a bottle of wine $40 on top of the RW menu. Speed of service felt a bit fast (maybe due to RW?).

5.0,6/11/2016,"I wanted to find a nice place to celebrate my fiance's birthday so I searched for ""Best steakhouse"" in the New York area.  I braced myself for the likelihood of the number 1 spot being beyond my budget - however I ended up being pleasantly surprised at the search results.  That's how I found Club A Steakhouse.It's a very nice space - cozy, spacious, welcoming and it's got a classic feel to it.  From what I could tell, there are two floors.  The first has a bar at the front, and larger tables are in the back down a short flight of stairs.  Upstairs seemed to be for smaller parties, but they also seem to be able to accommodate larger groups. At first it was pretty quiet and empty - that's what happens when you eat at 7, on a Monday.  But there were several more couples that ended up dining around us by the middle of our meal.  I could see this place being fairly busy at a prime eating time.  Now on to the juicy parts - what we ate!Bread basket? Yes please! I know I shouldn't eat them (it fills me up too quickly) but I love bread and this had a simple but delicious variety.Appetizer: we got the Canadian Bacon.  My picture doesn't really do it much justice, but the servers were thoughtful enough to halve it for us beforehand.  The helping was hearty enough with their steak sauce.  Bacon is naturally delicious, and I'm not sure how else to describe the taste aside from - it was bacon and it was really really really good.Entrees: I got the Chilean Sea Bass (it's not the one listed on yelp menu), fiance got the double eagle strip - medium rare.  Just thinking about how good it was makes me want to go back right now.  We like to share food with each other, so these two dishes felt like a good balance (mid meal - we weren't at the food coma point yet).  The fish was perfect - soft but evenly cooked with a nice crunch on top and a nice cream sauce too; none of which was too heavy.  The steak was tender and deliciously flavored.  Both portions were good sized servings too.Sides: Brussel Sprouts & Mac n'Cheese.  The brussel sprouts were yummy - roasted, and a little sweet, I would order them again for my veggies.  The Mac & Cheese was so good.  Everything came out piping hot, and this was cheesy (but not too much) with a crunchy topping.The food here was really top notch, but the service is also a large part of what made this dinner such a nice experience. They checked in frequently to see if anything was needed, cleared away our dishes regularly and all of them were just very hospitable and friendly.  What leaves a lasting impression is also the way the restaurant gave a complimentary ""mini-dish"" before our entrees came out - we got a mushroom cream ravioli and it was gooooooood.  Since it was a birthday, they plated the complimentary desserts very pretty-like.  To top it off, someone came around to take a picture which they printed and gave to us in a card at the end of our dinner!  There's something to be said about places that treat their guests so nicely without charging exorbitantly high prices.",2,0,1,Melanie W.,"New York, NY",131,14,35

5.0,5/26/2016,"Classy old-school style steak house. The interior was mostly dark wood, heavy drapes, candlelight and a single red rose in vase on every table. You get the picture.Hubby and I were on a date night. We decided to get the mixed grill platter for two to get the most bang for the buck and since it was our first time there, it was a good way to get a variety of proteins. We ordered everything med-rare. The dish came with lamb chops which were perfectly seasoned and cooked. A small filet, hanger steak and veal chop. The lamb and filet were the best. Very tender and flavorful. A little too much char on the hanger and the veal was too rare and I was not a fan of the texture.for a side to split we ordered the Brussels sprouts since it was one of the options not smothered in butter or cream. There was more than enough food especially with the complimentary mushroom ravioli app that they really should put on the menu. Plus a small sampler of desserts that were on the house. The profiteroles were fantastic! They really do everything that keeps customers happy and coming back.

5.0,5/21/2016,"I cannot say enough good things about this place. Was jones'n for a good steak. Meeting a good friend in the city and this was close by and, based on the reviews, decided to give it a try. I'm glad I did. I don't give many 5 stars but if I could give 6 would do so. Started out with the bacon and Caesar appetizers. The bacon was thick cut with the perfect char and sweetness, not too much fat, but enough to give good flavor. To be honest, for the most part Caesar is Caesar, but you could definitely taste the anchovies here. Then ordered the Porterhouse for 2, medium rare, which is where I thought we were in trouble, because it came out medium to medium well.  This is also where the restaurant and its staff really shined. The waiter overheard me question the temperature and just said ""if you don't like, I don't like"", and whisked the steak away to be replaced in short order with a perfectly cooked piece of meat that had incredible flavor, perfect char, black but not over powering, and melt in your mouth tenderness. We also ordered the sautéed mushrooms which were excellent and the asparagus, which we ordered grilled and they were happy to accommodate this request. After we finished dinner and were contemplating desert, a plate of tiramisu, cheese cake and profiteroles appeared, which were not only delicious, but were also compliments of the house to make up for the confusion with the steak.  Lastly we ordered a Catena Mendoza wine which they were out of, the waiter made an excellent suggestion in the same price point The decor is classic steak house, red walls, liens on the table, low light, real candles, equally suited to a business dinner, dinner with friends or a romantic night out, with the extra bonus of a two piece jazz group.",0,0,0,Mike G.,"Coral Gables, FL",1,23,0

There were pillows on some of the seats, which was really nice. Food: For appetizers, we ordered bacon, seafood platter, and lobster bisque. The bacon, as many other reviewers have noted, is a definite. I usually don't like bacon but this was juicy and delicious. The bisque was a little too salty for my taste but my bf really enjoyed it. For the main course, I ordered salmon and my bf ordered the T bone, which he really loved. For dessert, we were given a complimentary 3-piece dessert with ""Happy birthday"" written in chocolate.Service: one of the best experiences I've ever had. Our water was never below half the glass. The staff were readily available but not hovering. We received a complimentary appetizer and dessert. When we received our dessert, a hostess came to take a picture of us and then gave us the picture with a thank you card.

The dish was plenty for 2, we couldn't finish! We had their macaroni and cheese as a side dish - it didn't taste like your regular boring macaroni and cheese.

We were seated on the 2nd floor, and one should note that the tables are very close together, so you are inadvertently invited into the conversations happening right beside you.My biggest gripe was with the food--perhaps the yelp reviews and atmosphere set my expectations too high. I ordered a t-bone while my aunt got a petit filet mignon. Despite my t-bone being cooked perfectly, and sitting in a dishful of butter, there was really not much taste. As someone who, in general, finds American food to be over salty, my steak was surprisingly under seasoned, and, despite my adding salt, didn't have much of its own flavour. We also ordered a grilled brussels sprouts side, which was good, but nothing spectacular. They gave us each a single Spinach ravioli, which, albeit complementary, was just massively underwhelming; again the kitchen's light touch with salt was probably the largest misstep of the night.The dessert however, was delightful, and probably the best part of the meal. Overall, for the price point and the calories, I didn't particularly feel that investing my evening into this restaurant was a good choice. If it matters, I glanced through the wine list and the only things they had by the glass were American wines, so I didn't get any.",1,1,0,Joel K.,"San Francisco, CA",103,8,0

The celebrity treatment was genuinely above and beyond what I expected and always with a smile. The nostalgic ambience upstairs with a view of lit trees outside felt like you're dining under evening stars. Unexpected complimentary mushroom ravioli appetizer, waiters going out of their way to suggest off menu items for our toddlers, non pretentious crowd, and a complimentary birthday group photo to keep as a remembrance made the experience emotional, and therefore memorable.

4.0,4/7/2016,"From start to finish, my dinner at Club A was a fantastic dining experience. The food and service were both great. I was able to easily obtain a reservation for 7:30 on a Thursday evening on short notice (which some may say is a negative...but not me!). We arrived early and they were still able to seat us promptly. The dining room and bar areas are very comfortable and inviting. A funky jazz trio was just starting, and I have to say they were awesome! They were jamming out, but still managed to maintain acceptable restaurant volume. I really enjoyed their music (including a Michael Jackson cover), and I certainly wasn't expecting to be grooving to a funky bass line at a steakhouse. We ordered wine and they brought a nice bread variety basket. The two breads I tried were fresh and delicious (downside - the butter was too cold for spreading). I didn't want to fill up on bread because I knew I was about to get my eat on! I started with the caesar salad, which I wouldn't recommend. The flavor was good (nice hint of anchovy, and not too salty), but cutting is required, the croutons weren't toasted enough, and it was a bit overdressed for my taste. We move on. They brought a complimentary mushroom ravioli. I have to say, it was the single best piece of ravioli I have ever had...by far! We're talking death row meal kind of good. The texture of the pasta was resilient, but not too firm. The sauteed wild mushroom filling was earthy and well balanced. It was the cream sauce. The sauce was buttery, silky and rich. Simply put; it was executed perfectly. It was the best cream sauce I've ever had. I could bathe in the stuff. As for the main course, I had the 24 oz. bone-in ribeye (cooked medium rare plus...yes, you can order it that way!) with sauteed mushrooms and their whipped potato puree. The potatoes were buttery delicious, as were the mushrooms. The steak was also very good. They hit my desired temperature and it was seasoned very nicely...simple salt and pepper I think. The lean, center part of the cut seemed a little tough for a prime, dry-aged ribeye. That was somewhat disappointing, but the outer, fattier parts made up for that. All in all, I really enjoyed the meal. Just when I didn't think I could eat another bite, they brought a complimentary dessert trio of cream puffs, tira-misu, and some sort of chocolate mousse cake. All three were incredible! It was quite a nice service-oriented gesture. It implies that they are not trying to rush you out of there and that they want you to return and recommend them to others. The cynical side of me says they were trying to build/reinforce value, as two of us were already in for about $250 (wine was $100). Cynicism aside, I would have happily paid for the desserts, and it is that sort of service that sets Club A apart from many other top of the line steakhouses.",1,0,0,Brian S.,"Novi, MI",0,15,0

2.0,3/27/2016,Honestly not worth the money. Came here for a Valentine's Day dinner and I ordered the hangar steak while my friend ordered the filet mignon. We were both very unimpressed. The filet mignon was tender but too chewy. Same thing for the hangar steak. My jaw was getting tired from having to chew for so long. I also felt the seasoning on the hangar steak was not balanced and overly salty.  I've made steaks at home that taste way better imo. I also didn't really like the vibe of the restaurant - felt uptight and snooty. I'd recommend taking your money elsewhere for good steaks.

5.0,3/22/2016,"Here for the first time, celebrating an early anniversary. Great old-world ambiance -- for me, perfect in a traditional steakhouse. The hostess was very welcoming, having our coats checked for us and escorting us to our table. We were in the back area of the restaurant, with many, many windows lining the back wall. Privacy was assured by the luxuriant bamboo grove outside providing us with shelter from the residents we could peek-in on in the building behind us.The chatter with the Matre 'd and the wait staff was genuine and warm. I was very impressed by their -- primarily -- domestic wine list. That they had so many of my favorite Napa/Sonoma wineries represented was a real plus. The Stags Leap Cab 2012 I ordered (at a very reasonable price) was unavailable and we were offered several other highly recommended alternatives -- all within a very close price range. I actually selected the same wine from a 2013 vintage. Knowing Stags Leap, that one was very drinkable at this time. Happy!My wife started off with their Beet Salad, which she said was fresh without too much dressing (balsamic vinegret, I believe. I passed on a starter because I was pretty much interested in red meat -- and having already feasted for lunch at some friends' apartment with salmon for lunch. The bread basket offered had an incredible variety, including quite a few flatbread sheets, which I gobbled-up. My wife enjoyed a slice of some type of multi-grain.Not having enjoyed veal in some time, my wife ordered the Double-cut Veal Chop (one of my favorites), while I felt lazy and ordered their 16oz Filet Mignon -- medium rare. Two massive cuts of meat were prepared and delivered piping hot to the table, along with a big plate of gigantic asparagus spears with a drizzle of tangy Hollandaise and a sprinkle of fine-cut scallions. The veal chop was a thing of beauty and I immediately regretted not ordering one for myself instead of the filet. Modestly seasoned, but perfectly cooked the huge bone-in chop was moist, slightly charred, and gorgeous! She loved it, but was only able to eat about 1/3 of the cut. My filet had a great ""crispy"" char to it and was perfectly done to my taste.Somewhere during the evening, my wife must have mentioned to the waiter that we were celebrating our anniversary -- following our meal (we were totally stuffed!) -- they brought to our table a platter of selected deserts, all for our enjoyment. A nice drizzle of ""Happy Anniversary"" was written on the edge around the platter. For some reason there was a lighted candle on top of a cream-puff! I blew that out and we took a sample out of each of the four offerings. Outstanding -- not too sweet, but great pastries and cakes. The hostess doubles as their in-house photographer, stopped by to snap a nice ""souvenir"" of our dining experience and before we left, dropped off a gratis photo that captured our evening. What an incredibly nice touch!We go into NYC only every couple of months or so and when we do we usually have an excellent dining experience and take in as many cultural events as we can over a Friday-through-Sunday weekend. I'm telling you, Club A is now one of, if not THE, favorite restaurants in Manhattan. We're going to be going there again, and again!

5.0,3/21/2016,"Continuing on with my birthday month celebrations, my family and I went to Club A Steakhouse for a great formal dinner. I know its Lent and I shouldn't have had meat on Friday but God will forgive this poor sinner's love of meat for her birthday. From making the reservation, to coat check to ordering everything part of dinner was seamless. Our Waiter Diego was great and Ecuadorian so we felt right at home being Colombian. We ordered for the table:  -Tomato and Buffalo Mozzarella - very tasty and a good size to share if you are looking for a little something to nibble on as you intensely await your meat to come to you. -Calamari Fritti- fresh and the condiment served with it was very tasty and spicy.    We ordered individually- Filet Mignon 16 OZ each- I tell you that medium rare is the only way to eat this.** Main dishes DO NOT COME WITH ACCOMPANIMENTS** you must order your sides additionally. We had as sides the -Creamed Spinach   -5 Cheeses Truffle ""Mac""   Listen, unless you have fasted for 2 days prior to coming here DO NOT order 1 side per person. It is simply too much and a waste of food and money. Order 1 side to share between 2 people. I do recommend the truffle mac. The team knew that it was my birthday and printed ""Happy Birthday branded menus for my party which was a nice touch. All the staff said Happy Birthday to me and took a wonderful family photo of us and printed it as a gift. Sooo nice! Also dessert was gifted to me with big Happy Birthday Ingrid on the plate.

The second floor dining room is beautiful.  You're basically eye level with the trees covered in lights... it's really magical.2) The patrons: almost everyone is a couple. This is the perfect spot for a romantic evening - candles, a flower on each table, and everyone else is just as into their date as you are :)3) The service. We could not have been better taken care of than we were by our server.  He made sure our wine glasses were full, and checked on us frequently (but not obsessively). He also was willing to try making a cocktail he hadn't made before at my wife's request.4) The steaks. My wife and I both had the petite filet medium-rare, and it was cooked to perfection.  Slightly crispy on the outside, tender and flavorful on the inside.5) The sides.  Get the creamed spinach.  We will definitely be back soon!",1,1,0,Arjun S.,"Manhattan, NY",8,54,1
1.0,3/15/2016,"Peter Luger was booked, so this was our second option. We had reserved for a group of 13 non private which later on ended up being upgraded to a private room, free of charge. We had ordered the Porter house steak for 3 of us, Medium Rare. One steak was medium RARE as expected and the other was medium WELL. Later on, when we asked for separate checks, something that most restaurants should be accustom too, they told it either it would be extremely difficult and would take more than an hour to do. Even though we opted to give him that allotted time, he still was not able to properly separate the checks and ended up that WE had to do the calculations ourselves. His coworker came down later on and jokingly mentioned that our waiter has trouble with math in which we knew that there was some truth in what he said. After everything was all paid for, they had threatened to call the cops on us because they couldn't keep track of everything(disorganized). After standing there for an additional half hour of just clarifying everything for them, it was all squared away. All in all, for a restaurant of this caliber, I would have expected at least someone in their staff to be able to separate checks which we ended up doing ourselves. Also didn't expect them to have a problem with cooking the food either since they're so highly rated. Guess we were unlucky.",6,1,0,Anthony P.,"Arlington, VA",280,30,0

4.0,3/14/2016,"I came here on Saturday night for dinner with my wife to celebrate our 1st wedding anniversary. We were greeted and led upstairs to a nice little intimate seating area. The setting was very nice but I wasn't crazy about the weird keyboard music, I it felt like I was in the Napoleon Dynamite movie!For appetizer we ordered the bacon which lived up to the hype. It was thick. Juicy and had just the right amount of fat. For entrees we ordered the Bone in Rib-eyes, medium rare with a side of the maple Brussels sprouts and the Mac and cheese. After a short wait these were presented to us. Right away I noticed my steak look very charred so cut into the middle to check the temperature. My suspicions were correct, both our steaks were very much medium. The room is so dark that I had to use this flashlight on my phone to check this and the waiter asked if he could see to after which he agreed. The waiter apologized and took them away and said he would send out new ones. We waited around 15 - 20 minutes for the replacements which was fine, but this time the steaks that came out were really rare and mostly dark purple and cold on the inside. This was such a disappointment that a highly rated NY steakhouse that charges $60 per steak can't cook a steak to the correct temperature.. Anyways I am not one to return food twice so reluctantly ate my steak because I was so hungry but it was difficult to stomach because the meat was not hot or even warm in the middle. . My wife on the other hand could  not stomach more than a third of the steak and she only ate around the edges which were medium rare. When we asked for the check the waiter asked my wife if everything was OK since she had most of her meal left on the plate and she mentioned that her steak was too rare to eat but she didn't want to complain but asked that her comments be relayed to the chef as an FYI. I said to the waiter that mine was the same but I ate it because I was so hungry and didn't want to complain. The waiter advised that he ""didn't want our steaks to be overcooked again"" which I felt sounded weird, did he order us rare steaks in the hope they would heat up to medium rare during the resting period? Shortly after this, a different waiter brought 2 filet minions to the couple on the table next to us and bizarrely asked them to cut the steaks in half to see if they needed to be more cooked. I thought this was highly inappropriate for a steakhouse since their food would get cold pretty quickly. Did the waiters not have faith in the chef working that evening?   The waiter came back to our table and offered 2 drinks on the house which was nice and when he came back with the check, he had informed us that the 2 steaks had been removed from the bill. This was a very nice gesture by the restaurant and not one we asked for or expected. We were highly impressed with the level of service in this restaurant and even though the food wasn't quite up to par on this particular occasion, the service made up for any shortcomings of the experience which is why this review is 4 starts and not 2.I would definitely give this place another try.",2,0,0,Mike G.,"Westfield, NJ",22,29,5
5.0,3/12/2016,"Really regret writing this review because once you find a gem you want to keep it all to yourself but that would be a grave injustice to the owners and staff. We took my mom here tonight for her 90th birthday. I noted that on the Open Table reservation and the staff greeted her with happy birthday and the menus said ""Happy Birthday "" on top. Anything I complain about from here on is nit picking. TJ, our waiter, was affable, attentive and knowledgeable. We had Oysters that were fresh (a few out of the dozen were small) but tasted briny and clean. The Steak Tartar is the best I've had in a long, long time. Mains were New York Strip, double cut veal chop and lamb chops.  Sides were an incredible creamed spinach with truffles, whipped potatoes and asparagus with bearnaise sauce and almonds. My Mom thought the lamb chops were fatty, I thought they were just a bit under done but no matter, we all shared. Deserts were on the house and wonderful. When the bill came the lamb chops had been removed without question. The space is intimate and the bar cozy. perfect live music.

Sautéed asparagus was excellent and truffle Mac-n-cheese seemed good though I am not a big fan of truffles. The desert sampler plate we had included cheesecake, tiramisu and profiterole.

1.0,3/1/2016,"LONG STORY SHORT - DO NOT COME HERE. I have honestly been never so offended in my life from dining at a restaurant, and I consider myself someone with pretty thick skin. If you read other low reviews you will see that they have had similar experiences as me, so dining here is like playing Russian roulette.Terrible would be an understatement of my dining experience. I'm usually pretty generous with my stars on yelp and you really have to offend me to get a one star, and Club A Steakhouse managed to do it. HOW!? A 4.5 star with 1823 yelp reviews!? On steak - my favorite food! It really surprised me too.We ordered the rib eye and the filet mignon, and waited 50 minutes for our steaks to come out. We ordered medium rare like a lot of people order their steaks, and our steaks came out on the wrong side of medium well, and the crust on the steaks tasted burnt. We call the waiter over, we tell him that we think our steaks are overcooked.Which sucks right! Waiting 50 minutes for food to come out and it's overcooked.The waiter asks my mom to cut her filet mignon down the middle, and see if it's medium rare in the middle. It's bordering on medium/medium well, which is fine, but we are paying $50 for a steak and we should probably get it how we want them.We actually had to flag down a couple different waiters who kept switching off on us, making us feel like we were the problem customers. We ask the first waiter if this is what they consider a medium rare. First waiter says ""I can't tell you how you enjoy your steaks"" and then disappears without addressing us that he was leaving to get someone else. WTF? A second waiter comes, we ask the same question. ""Would you consider this a medium rare?"" and he says yes. First of all if that was the restaurant standard for a medium rare then this place deserves a fat L and a 1 star. But he makes an effort to mediate the situation, insisting we get our steaks how we want it. We ask for medium rare, and he says he'll do a medium rare plus, because maybe we liked it a little more rare than their 'medium rare'Somehow the second round of steaks take 10 minutes to come out. Ask us to cut them open and see if it looks good. The whole attitude from the wait staff at this point just made us feel uncomfortable, but I have pretty thick skin - if the steak comes out good I will just eat it and forget this ever happened.So we cut open the steaks, it's pretty hard to tell in the dim light of the restaurant so at first glance it looks fine. Once we take a bite the steak is just rare. For me, rare is fine when you're eating a thinner slice of meat, but rare is not fine on a thick filet mignon. At this point it's been over an hour since ordering and they fucked up our steaks twice. I try and flag down a waiter again, and now they're all pretending that they aren't making eye contact with me. Finally flag one down and ask for the manager.Manager does what a manager is supposed to do, and at the end we had pretty good steaks to eat... but the experience was completely ruined. They offered a complimentary dessert but we didn't really want to be in the restaurant any longer.In all my years of eating out at restaurants, I've never had a dining experience as bad as this. It was so bad that even though I realize I'm being a petty little bitch whining about a restaurant on yelp, this is pretty much the only thing that will help me feel better about the situation.",6,0,1,Jordan L.,"New York, NY",179,246,2
4.0,3/1/2016,"THE place to go for special occasions! SERVICE (5 stars): They do an amazing job - most restaurants I have to hassle and repeatedly call to remind about making a special custom menu or writing ""happy birthday"" on a dessert, but that is not the case here. I simply made a note in my opentable reservation that it was an anniversary and then when they called to confirm my reservation, they added that they would be giving us a complimentary dessert trio with happy anniversary written on the plate, which was fabulous. They also wrote ""happy anniversary"" on the menu and greeted us with a huge, friendly ""happy anniversary"" as soon as we got in, and continued to repeat it throughout the night. They also took a photo for us and framed it in a card signed by the owner himself. The wait staff was super friendly and attentive the entire night. No complaints at all! Everything was perfect.AMBIANCE (5 stars): Ask to be seated upstairs near the window. It's a nice view and super romantic. I also like that it's quieter than downstairs, though if you want something more casual, downstairs is really nice also since they seem to have live music sometimes (they did the night we went anyway).FOOD (4 stars): Not the best we've had but definitely pretty good. The sea bass was a little overcooked and the porterhouse steak was cooked with a great deal of butter, which we didn't prefer, but to each their own (I know some people like it that way). Otherwise, we thoroughly enjoyed both entrees. I particularly loved how the vegetables that came with the sea bass were cooked. The whipped potatoes are a MUST order; they taste like heaven. The Kim Crawford Sauv Blanc was also excellent--nice and crisp just how I like it--and a great pairing for the sea bass.Will DEFINITELY return, probably to try booking one of the private rooms for another special occasion.

Though good, I prefer Peter Luger's bacon better - I feel like Peter Luger excels in the bacon area. The steak was juicy and cooked medium well as we requested. Service is where Club A Steakhouse shines. Every table was given a free side of some sort - we received free mashed potatoes, which were so flavorful. The portion was enough for two as well, so if you think free means tiny, think again. Then, at the end of our meal, we got a HUGE plate of desserts, which consisted of an entire slice of cheesecake, an entire slice of tiramisu, and cream puffs. So make sure you save room for dessert because every table is given free dessert!

4.0,2/16/2016,"My husband and I went here last night. When we first arrived, they had complimentary coat check and held our shopping bags since we just came from Bloomingdale's around the corner which I really appreciated. A lot of NY restaurants don't do that and you end up feeling super crowded with all your bags and huge winter coats at your table so I was relieved to find that they have this service for free. We both ordered the ribeye and french fries and brussel sprouts as our sides. The server gave us a complimentary mushroom ravioli starter and 3 different desserts on a plate (chocolate mousse case, cream puffs, and tiramisu cake). I can see why this restaurant is rated so highly. The steaks were delicious and the service was great! If the steak was a little less charred on the outside and a TINY bit less cooked on the inside (i ordered medium), it would have be perfect. Nonetheless, it was still a fantastic meal for us. The fries were sprinkled with garlic and thyme and it was so delicious as well. For the brussel spouts, I would have liked it to be a little less oily but other than that, the taste was great. It was seasoned with maple and lemon. For the ambiance, it was very old time New York. I would highly recommend you to sit on the second level because the view is very pretty and romantic. I wish I knew so i could have made reservations for a table up there. The total check was $147 (with tax) which included the two ribeyes ($56 each and the 2 sides) but we were really happy to get complimentary starters and desserts.

All free of charge. We didn't even ask for it. Most memorable steakhouse experience.Cons: it was my least favor steak out of all the steakhouses I've went. Probably worse than J&R steakhouse. So the main course experience wasn't a good one for sure. I was pretty disappointed. However, i only had it once, so I would give this place a second try and if the steak tastes the same as the first time, then the steak is no good. So to be fair I can't judge maybe it was just an off day. So 4 stars for now. If it's good next time I will change my review to 5 stars. Advice for management: keep up the good work with your team. Had a great time. Up the steak game and you will be my favorite. Bless up",2,1,1,Albert H.,"New York, NY",773,25,7
5.0,2/14/2016,"went here for a second time, and it was as good as the first.  4 of us, all got and loved our steaks.  i had the porterhouse for 2 with my sig other, my guests had the NY prime strip.  (all was $49 per person), we were licking the plates.  service was very very good.  so, i am giving it 5 stars, however i want to nitpik: the calamari, while not overpriced, was very underwhelming.  its like calamari u might get from long john silvers.  had i known, i wouldn't have gotten it.  in addition, while i understand that it is common practice for a steakhouse to do this, i don't like having to pay for sides separately.  any steak should at least include mashed potatoes, but thats more a general complaint than one vs Club A.bottom line: anytime i want an upscale dining exp to impress somebody, Club A is on the short list!  i will def be back!",2,1,1,Mike W.,"Manhattan, NY",9,11,0

The waiter filled our glasses and cleared the table before the thought could even cross our minds to ask. He was always checking on us without being intrusive, which I really appreciate at a nice dinner. The food and drinks were great. We started with champagne and then the waiter recommended a bottle of red to pair with our steaks. Both were delicious (I highly recommend the brussel sprouts as a side). We were brought a complimentary dessert at the end that had ""happy anniversary"" written on the plate. It was just the cherry on top of the whole dinner. On our way out, we were joking around with the manager and (at his request) made a reservation to come back next year.

Our experience  here was excellent !The service was excellent and  the dry aged steaks were AMAZING and perfectly cooked to our specifications. My side of Mac and cheese was to die for, and the mashed potatoes were merely good ( not the best I've ever had but I'm a little biased/spoiled with my mashed potatoes). The ambience was nice we would have preferred a window seat but I can't complain as we made last minute reservations. To top it all off our waiter saw that we only finished half of our meals (we were so full) and seeing as we couldn't take them to go he gave us dessert on the house which was very nice and very tasty.

1.0,1/31/2016,"Had a reservation for about a party of 14 people. They were prompt with seating, as expected. This place had let most of us down. We later found out that there was a change in management recently that could possibly be the cause of that. The bill was aboutt $1360 for all of us and we were not impressed. My dishes were the salmon, crab cakes, and macaroni. The salmon was very bland, I had to ask for extra sauce on the side 2x. It was even a bit salty if anything and I didn't finish it completely. The crab cake dish was burnt - black on the tops. It came with salad and that was good (go figure). The four cheese macaroni was horrible. It tasted like Kraft's plastic pasta, plain with a later of cheddar on top. That's right, the macaroni was not even sautéed or had sauce. The wines run about $11-20 per glass. Getting 3.5-4 glasses per bottle, there's no incentive of buying a bottle for 4x the price. They said they switch the items on the menu off/on every so often to get an idea of what their best dishes are. Honestly we looked them up prior on yelp and half of the dishes were unavailable when we got there, so beware. Some of the drinks ordered were horrible, the Margaritas tasted like Margarita mix from the grocery store and no tequila. One of the steaks was so cold and rare that it felt like it had been cooked in the AM and left out all day. We sent a lot of these items back to the kitchen/bar needless to say and there were a lot of complaints. They remade the drinks, heated the cold steak (which turned out to still be bad and they had to replace it with another dish), and still charged us for all of the mac n cheese. I would not recommend this establishment. They charge quite the price for not-so-succulent food and I'm not happy about going. Sorry, Club A!",8,0,1,Tricia C.,"Manhattan, NY",154,140,190

5.0,1/20/2016,"It is restaurants like Club A Steakhouse that give New York City's Steakhouses their elite reputation.  I have had dinner here twice.  Both experiences were absolutely perfect.  It is definitely one of my favorite places to go for dinner in Manhattan.The first time, I went with just my mom before a Broadway show.  We split a Maine Lobster and a Filet Mignon.  Both were cooked to perfection.  Our server could not have been nicer.  He was very attentive and extremely friendly.  He even took a photo of us with his professional camera at the end of our meal and printed it out for us.  So nice!We decided to bring our whole family back during our next trip to NYC around Christmas time.  We were celebrating a birthday.  This meal was, somehow, even better!  Everything was delicious- even the bread before the meal!  My sister and I split the Lobster Cocktail for an appetizer.  It was very fresh.  As our entree, we split the Prime Dry Aged Porterhouse Steak for 2.  We were amazed when he brought it out.  It literally looked like an artistic masterpiece.  It was unlike any steak I had ever tried.  It was phenomenal.  We ordered a side of Bearnaise sauce with it, but never even used it because the steak was perfect on its own.  We also split a side of the Golden Yukon Whipped Potatoes and the Creamy Spinach- YUM!As we were getting ready to pay the bill, our server brought out a complimentary dish of desserts for our table.  It was so sweet!  My favorite desserts were the Tiramisu and Profiteroles. Club A Steakhouse has a welcoming and elegant atmosphere.  Its decor is absolutely gorgeous-  bold red themes, low lighting by chandeliers and candles.  It is fun to sit by the large window on the upper floor.  It overlooks 58th Street.They are also festive during the holiday season.  They decorate the trees out front with lights that are also visible from the tables on the second floor.  It is a beautiful view.  It reminds me of somewhere Tony Soprano would go for a steak.  I would absolutely recommend this place for a dinner, especially if you are celebrating a special occasion.  They treat you so well and will be sure to make your dinner memorable!",8,1,2,Jane B.,"Buffalo, NY",273,399,5557

I'll say this: We were five minutes into our night waiting to be seated and I said to my boyfriend, ""We're coming back here for my birthday next month."" But, I'll still share the details: Ambiance: A dim, intimate that lends itself for any type of company - date, business + friendly outings. We even had a lit candle on our table. Food: Absolutely delicious! For appetizers, we have the Escargot and Fried Calamari. For our entrees, we had Prime Rib Eye (24oz), Hanger Steak and Side Trio: Truffle Mac & Cheese, Potato Puree, and Roasted Mushrooms. P.S. their moscato is amazing. Service: We felt right at home. The server had excellent recommendations about the wine and the food! We were not rushed and they wished my boyfriend ""many more years!"" when they brought out the dessert. Special Occasions: When I made the reservation, I told them it was for a birthday. When we arrived our menus had ""Happy Birthday"" written on it, they brought out a dessert platter, and they took our picture, printed it, and brought it in a ""Happy Birthday"" card signed by the owner (with a real pen - not a stamp) - and all of this was on the house !!

3.0,1/9/2016,"We came here the other night to treat ourselves to a nice steak and literally just googled ""best steakhouse NYC"" and this place was the highest rated.Service was meh, they changed our waiter half way through the meal. Not all that attentive with the water and drinks. Certainly not on par with a fine dining experience but it wasn't  terrible service.We started with a Cesar and the famous bacon- both were ok. The bacon is just a big chunk of pork belly. I really don't see what the fuss is about.We got the porterhouse for two, truffle Mac and cheese, whipped potatoes, and sautéed broccoli. The filet side of the steak was perfect, the strip side was way too fatty and chewy even for a strip. My fiancé was put off by the overwhelming amount of grease and oil collecting in the bottom of the cast iron skillet. Didn't bother me all that much but it was a little excessive. If I ever end up there again I would just get the filet by itself.Truffle Mac was super truffle-y which I don't like but I'm sure a lot of people do. I prefer a hint of truffle. Whipped potatoes were great. Broccoli was nothing special.Complimentary dessert was a nice touch but they didn't even ask if we wanted coffee. Which I did. My assumption is that because I was wearing jeans and not dressed like I was rolling in dough we got crappier service.

From the hostess to the coat check attendant at the end of the evening - everyone was pleasant and welcoming. We were seated at a wonderful corner table upstairs in front of floor to ceiling windows. Perfect view of the lit up trees outside! They lit a candle and the entire atmosphere was very romantic and special. The menu came with a personalized ""Happy Birthday"" across the top which they let him keep. At the end of the meal, they brought a complimentary dessert plate with ""Happy Birthday"" written on the rim in chocolate frosting. Then to top it off, they took a complimentary photo of us together and had it printed all before the check came. It was more than just dinner - it felt like an experience! We did not feel rushed at all and the servers were very attentive. I don't eat meat but my boyfriend said the steak was absolutely amazing. The sides were just okay (brussels tasted like you'd expect but nothing to write home about) but with the large portions of meat and fish they give you, that is truly the main event.

5.0,12/5/2015,"Walking into Club A Steakhouse, the first thing you'll probably notice is the atmosphere. The walls are red everywhere here with dim lights to enhance the romantic atmosphere. The tables were close together but far enough apart to allow the privacy that New Yorkers often crave from restaurants. There seemed to be a lot of couples celebrating their birthdays or anniversaries, and everyone was dressed up in suits and classy dresses. The wine list here is extensive, the the owner is kind enough to allow patrons to bring a bottle of wine for a $25 corkage fee (a great budget tool for us struggling 20-something year olds.) The steakhouse has traditional offerings of sides, but I have to say that the steak was definitely my favorite. I got to try the filet mignon and it was heavenly. The dinner ended on a great note when the waiter brought out the free dessert. And although my dinner companion and I were stuffed to the brim with all the amazing food, we immensely enjoyed the dessert platter.Doesn't look like this will become my regular watering hall anytime soon (being on a budget and all), but I think that I would definitely come back for a special occasion (or for mom and dad perhaps.)",4,1,2,Julia V.,"Manhattan, NY",354,142,73

Nearly everyone gave it 4 or 5 stars. Wow I see why! The decor, ambiance, and friendly staff makes this restaurant fabulous. An added bonus is how intimate the atmosphere is which is very appealing to me. My boyfriend started with green salad, both ordered swordfish w/veggies, and potatoes. Food tasted great! Our server Billy brought us an appetizer to sample which was ravioli mushroom pasta. Hmm so delicious. By the time desert came I was stuffed. But our waiter surprised us with a desert sampler. This was mini samplers of cheesecake, chocolate cake, custard cake, & two others I can't remember. All the deserts were so good. I can't rave enough about this restaurant. If you go ask to be seated upstairs. Although this place is expensive it's not the type of restaurant that is expensive and food taste awful or they give you small portions. Club A Steakhouse is a wonderful place to dine at. Being that this was my first trip to New York I don't remember the last time I enjoyed myself so much.

For the entre, I had the half roast lemon chicken which was excellent. Overall, my buddies and I had a great time when we came here. Of course it'll be a bit pricey, but this kind of restaurant and the location it is in, the price will match and justify the quality of service.

My favorite view was the second floor, floor to ceiling windows with Christmas light decorated trees outside.I enjoyed the complimentary appetizer of a porcini mushroom ravioli. Pretty good, especially the tasty sauce.It took awhile to get the steak, a 28 day dry-aged porterhouse. The steak was delicious, juicy, tender, easy to chew, the real reason to go to Club A.The side dishes of brussel sprouts (bland) and mushrooms (marinated when it didn't need it) were unmemorable. The hash browns were pretty good with a nice, slightly spicy crust on top of the potatoes.The complimentary dessert at the end was a nice touch, the slice of cheese cake was particularly good. The cream puffs and tiramisu were tasty but not exceptional.Overall, I would come back for the steak.

I'm not a big red meat eater, but given the reputation of Club A I was excited to try some steak.The restaurant itself is beautifully decorated. Low lighting with lots of red tones - a great intimate setting which augments the whole ""upscale steakhouse"" feel they're going for. As soon as you walk in there's a bar to the right, with some seating towards the back plus a second level with more seating. We were seated upstairs. Because it was an educational dinner we had a fixed menu to choose from. The bread basket contained a variety of carbs - lots of different breads, breadsticks, and crackers to choose from. For my app I went with the soup of the day which was asparagus. It was smooth and tasty - ideal for an autumn night. For my main I went with hanger steak - full of flavor and paired with a smoky steak sauce. They also served family-style sides of creamed spinach, mashed potatoes, and mac and cheese.

From start to finish, a horrible experience. For starters, it took them a half hour to take our drink orders. After that, drinks arrived quickly, except for one that took an additional fifteen minutes. We ordered an appetizer set of oysters, one of which was legit frozen solid. Cocktail sauce was literally just ketchup and horseradish. Oysters had little flavor and we're mostly small. Our steaks came to the table without adornment - just a naked slab of beef on a plate. My filet mignon, ordered rare, was chilled in the middle. Complaining to the waiter resulted in him telling me that it was supposed to be cold; I understand a rare steak being room temp, but cold? Ridiculous. Also, the silverware was dull, making it difficult to cut through the steaks. We had to really put some elbow grease into it to cut the meat. Drinks were okay, but the wine list was very poor, and overpriced. To their credit, the free ravioli was delicious, and complimentary desert was nice.

Our waiter took a long time to get to our table and never introduced himself to us when he took our order, in which he took without any expression. We tried to carry a conversation with him, but he just ignored it. When our food was brought out, we were also given a plate of french fries, which we didn't order. The owner (I think?), did come over to make sure we like the food.  After we finished the main course, we waited over 15 minutes, hoping that someone would bring us the menu for desserts. We were surprised when another man came over and gave us the bill instead. When we asked him about the desserts, he told us that we could order from their dessert menu. At this point, we felt unwelcome since we were already given the bill even though we did not ask for it, so we decided to just pay and not get dessert anymore. Our waiter never smiled at us once. We initially thought this was just his personality, but we later saw him happily chatting and smiling with other customers. I'm not quite sure why he took a personal dislike towards us. When we asked another man for our waiter's name, he was hesitant to tell us. After that, our waiter (which we learned is named Gero?) suddenly became very hospitable and offered us complimentary desserts.Overall, we are very disappointed with our experience in this restaurant.

5.0,10/5/2015,I took a party of six here for dinner last week. The food was amazing as always. Four of us had the 16 ounce filet which was cooked perfectly. Others had fish dishes which were very very good.The owners sent over a complimentary appetizer of lobster ravioli as well as a very large dessert dish to thank us for coming in.

3.0,10/3/2015,Was there with a party of 11 and had the private room which was on third floor.  They have a balcony which is nice when weather is accommodating.  Based on reviews was expecting big things but it didn't live up to hype. For apps we had bacon and seafood platter and bacon was a little burnt. Ordered the 24 oz dry age rib eye which is the signature item on menu.  Ordered my steak medium rare and it was more on the medium side. Steak tasted ok and maybe if I didn't read so many good things I may not have expected much.  The service was good and they did comp us 3 dessert plates.,0,0,0,Vincent N.,"Manhattan, NY",0,65,0

5.0,10/3/2015,"It got to be 5 stars - as it was indeed the great dinner time. May be I had better steak than what I had here, but with the great service they provided to us, it made our dinner the best. It was my birthday last night, and I was dining with most important people in my life. I was so happy that every one in our table were very much satisfied and got full with happy moodWe reserved the table only 2 days in advance yet I could grab the table at 8:00. As we mentioned that it will be b-day party and requested for a nice view spot, hostess lead us to table where has nice window view. It wasn't too crowed as it was Thursday dinner time. On the table, they were greeting us with special b-day menu. I think there are nothing special on b-day menu except the title on the top which says ""HAPPY BIRTHDAY"". Still gives little special feeling already. We ordered bacon and salad for appetizer. It was very juicy bacon yet it was too salty for us. Watch out for people who really doesn't want salty food. Salad was nothing special.Steak - it was great! We were 4 and order porterhouse for 2 and double lamb chop. They have very generous portion so it was more than enough for us. Double lamb chop was exceptional as well. It was so tender and cooked perfectly.They also gave us complimentary lobster ravioli while we were waiting for our steak. It was very delicious as well.

Not too far from her place, high quality food at a price you'd expect and not much more!They included a complimentary desert, as well as a nice mushroom ravioli compliments of the chef in between our appetizer and entree. We got a complimentary photo at the end of the meal, not to mention we were placed right by the window upstairs.... basically lots of awesome things to make the anniversary a nice outing, without much effort from myself :)We got bacon, soup and the mixed grill for two. Bacon was to die for. honestly I wish I could just stop in and buy one on any normal day. GF said the soup was great. Mixed grill had 2 lambchops, hangar steak, fillet mignon, and veal. I almost wish we just ordered a bunch of lambchops, it was so good. Someone next to us ordered a huge steak that also smelled amazing. The hangar steak was great, along with the filet mignon. I wasn't a fan of the texture of the veal, but I've also never had veal before so it might just be the cut that I personally don't like.All in all, would definitely come back again!",0,0,0,Ryan C.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,29,0
5.0,9/29/2015,the Service alone warrants a visit but throw in some good food how could you say no. I've tried 4 steak houses so far in NY and this is my favorite considering the food taste in particular. First off get a reservation. I made the mistake arriving on sunday night and was told no tables were available for the remainder. The place is not grandiose in size so its easy to imagine seating coming scarce without reserving one. 2ndly the parking is garage further down the street the restaurant is located at and they do validate parking (Discounted i believe).My my appetizer was the Club A Bacon and Caeser Salad.The salad was nothing special(good but nothing to separate from the pack) and the bacon was divine (though one spot was extremely fatty/chewy that you'd have to be daring to attempt and swallow it without choking.Entree was the Ny Strip and i was able to eat my companies Sirloin. She agreed it was the best steak tasted in our NY visit. By no means not the best I've had (I had plenty of steak however) but it does stand amongst the pack. Soft juicy with a great texture (medium prepared).Service is what throws this place ahead of the pack. Steak houses have always supplied great service(least the top ones do)but when the chef gives complimentary entrees and complimentary desserts  yes i said Desserts that are amazing quality and taste how can you really top that? Our table practically had 3 individuals serving us so things were promptly taken care off without hassleOverall a fine experience and would come here again. Would definitely reccomend it,0,0,0,John G.,"Waukegan, IL",300,119,222

If anything the service may be just slightly TOO attentive.  I kinda felt like someone was hovering at all times, but I don't have any real complaints and would like to go back.  Oh, one question--Yelp says there is outdoor seating.  Other than the bench out front, which I assume is for waiting for your table, I saw no outdoor seating.  Did I miss it?",0,0,0,Kathleen S.,"New York, NY",27,419,65

1.0,8/28/2015,"Ok, I don't know what all of you all are thinking. This place is terrible. I took my boyfriend for his birthday and it was such a disappointment. First off, the place isn't dressy or as nice as they would like you to think it is. People were wearing shorts, the carpet was worn, it does not cater to high end clientele. However, their prices would make you think they do. Anyways, once we were seated a bread basket was immediately delivered to the table. Ok, thanks. But no water was poured, no one greeted us, it was just a bunch of servers in black walking around the room. It didn't make any sense. I had to ask for water. When that finally arrived, I had to ask for a drink menu, ok no drink menu, fine. He just said ""they have a full bar."" Whatever, at least offer me something. But no, I had to ask (again) for the wine menu. A few minutes later, he brought it over. Once we had it, he never came back over to ask us what we wanted. We had to flag down another waiter ask ask him (again) if we could order wine. Unbelievable. Mind you, no one has greeted us still. They didn't know that it was our first time at the restaurant and they didn't know if was my boyfriend's birthday. Getting heated, I walked up from the table and asked a server who our table's server was and he said no one, they just kinda float. Ok, fine i said and then I told him it was my boyfriend's birthday. He said they'd take of it. Minutes later, another sever came over and plopped down complimentary mushroom ravioli (they give it to everyone, so it was nothing special). It was chewy and the sauce was watery. Getting tired of holding our menus, we flagged down another waiter and asked him if we could order. Again having to ASK. He seemed annoyed when I asked him how the fish was prepared and deterred us from ordering more vegetables. After ordering, my water glass remained empty until I got up and had to ask someone else for water. Literally, unbelievable. The food was ok, my boyfriend's filet was served on the bone (which he didn't ask for) and we were subsequently charged $49 for when the filet was listed as $42. They tried to make up for their lack of service at the end, but it didn't help. The tone was set, a nice birthday dinner for my boyfriend was ruined and we will never be back.  If you're skimming through this, just read this: it's not worth your time or money.

I ordered the New York strip, which was delicious, and my girlfriend ordered the hangar steak which was equally as good. Appetizers were calamari and clams. Very good choice. They even comp'ed us an interesting and tasty order of mushroom ravioli and desert.The only issue with our experience was the disappointment in drinks. At $13 a drink, I would expect to be able to taste the Jameson in my Jameson and ginger ale. My girlfriend also commented to me that she couldn't taste her belvedere vodka when she drank her belvedere and pineapple. This is just a small critique, everything else was delicious and romantic.

1.0,8/25/2015,"I was on a business trip to New York and decided to go to this place with my colleague. I had such a wonderful experience last year when I visited. However, this visit was a total disappointment. To start things off, our water was not refilled promptly. Our glasses were sitting there empty for a while. It then took forever to get our orders in. Once the food came, my lamb chops were much rarer than what I wanted (medium). It was totally uncooked/raw inside. It took me forever to get our waiter's attention to have him send it back to the kitchen. After dessert, we then again waited forever for the check. We finally decided to ask someone to bring us the check. Once we signed it, our waiter took the signed check IMMEDIATELY! I've traveled to so many cities and have never seen that happened. After we left the restaurant that night, we decided to go back and talk to the manager. The manager said that was their policy - not giving customers their checks until they ask and checking the signed check immediately even when the customer is still there - and said if we got his attention earlier, he could have done something (meaning nothing he could do with the bad experience we had).

5.0,8/22/2015,"This steak house is so serious about their business and I appreciate their kindness and generosity. Once one of my BFFs got hurt by a bitch and was very upset. I know to guys, the non-prescription drug to cure breakups is steak. So I brought him here to cheer him up. As an Asian, I am not a big steak eater at all so I didn't look very excited either. Among all the happy loving couples sitting around on their romantic dates, we did look like a couple who are going to divorce. During our dinner, a senior gentleman ( highly suspicious he is the owner) and our waiter came to our table several times to check if things were ok. They must have thought we didn't like the food so they kept bringing complimentary delicious food to cheer us up - soups, raviolis, and then a huge platter of all kinds of desserts. It's quite hard for my friend to put a smile instantly and it was too embarrassing for us to stand up and tell them that we were not upset because of their food here but because of a bitch somewhere else. So.... the only thing we could do was sitting there and being fed. Huh, sorry! But I really do appreciate their kindness and spirit to run this awesome business seriously. Actually my friend loved the steak very much and was indeed cheered up after the meal (maybe cured a bit too), and I was super happy about the platter of desserts...Thank you all for the generosity and I so look forward to going back, hopefully with friends for good reasons...By the way, I also love how they deco the entrance.

We started with the Canadian bacon appetizer, that was smoked and cooked to perfection.  The fried calamari was next, and it was prepared with a delicious crunchy coating and a side sauce that enhanced the perfectly cooked squid.  The lobster ravioli was beyond special - big chunks of lobster in and on top of the ravioli served with a delicate cream sauce that did not overpower the lobster.  The triple cut lamb chops were cooked to perfection and every mouthful was delectable.  This was perhaps my favorite dish, as it complemented the super Tuscan wine recommended by JT beautifully.  The glass that held my wine was also lovely and allowed my wine to breathe throughout my meal.  Our dining party also had the Chilean sea bass which was cooked with a seared crust that brought out the flavor of the fish.  The bed of baby sliced asparagus paired nicely with the sea bass.  The roasted Brussels sprouts with bacon and cheese was over the top, as was the decadent desserts.  JT our server, was cordial and made recommendations for our meal.  His pleasant disposition and attentive service added to our most excellent dining experience.  JT is a true asset to this establishment and was never intrusive, but always happened to be there when we needed something.  The live jazz was exemplary and we are going back again tonight, as our experience was so wonderful.  Great dining venue on the east side!!!",2,0,1,Deborah K.,"Wantagh, NY",0,23,5

1.0,7/23/2015,"I went to this restaurant based on the great reviews I read on Yelp. Unfortunately I was extremely disappointed:- When asked about drinks, the waiter had no idea what kind of drinks were available. The only drink he was certain the bar had was a Gin and Tonic. Which I would hope they would, most bars do... He also made a special trip back to ask if we wanted ice in our Martinis, which we thought was bizarre. - We ordered the Crab Cakes (Which were phenomenal I will give this restaurant that), however the waiter didn't seem to know how to use two spoons to deliver the crab cakes. Quite a bit of time was spent in awkward silence as the waiter shuffled the crab cakes around the plate trying to figure out how he should do it.- Here's where I really have a problem with this place: I ordered the New York Strip while my fiance ordered the T-Bone special, both medium rare. When the steaks arrived, mine was more on the medium side then rare, and my fiance's was well done. Not a sign of even slightly pink meat. It came out on a sizzling skillet pre-sliced with every slice completely brown. When this was pointed out to the waiter, he asked her to cut into the slices, which were of course all brown on the inside. I'm not sure why this piece of meat even left the kitchen considering you didn't have to cut into it to see that it seriously way over cooked. The waiter took the piece back (without apologizing), and a different waiter brought a new T-Bone over about 15 minutes later. (During which my finance insisted I started eating my steak so it didn't get cold.  She didn't want two $50 steaks to go to waste so she sat there with nothing while I had my meal). This new waiter had an unwarranted attitude and acted as if it was our fault that the steak was over cooked. He stated that since the steak was on a hot skillet, it continues cooking after it leaves the kitchen and is brought to the table. He made my fiance feel like it was her fault that the steak came out overcooked. He then proceeded to take it upon himself to disassemble the entire T-Bone in front of us and placed the pieces on top of the bone to prevent them from cooking. Easily the most unprofessional action I have seen in a long time.Firstly, the logistics of how you cook your steak, the delivery method, or excuses for why her medium rare steak came out well done is not a concern of mine. I payed good money to have a properly cooked steak brought out to me. It's pretty simple, If I order a rare steak and it comes out well done, it is not what I ordered. I understand in the case of the New York strip I ordered medium rare and it came out on the medium side of things. Fine, I can tolerate that. But medium rare and well done are two very different steaks.Secondly, the rudeness of this second waiter was unwarranted and unnecessary. If you are unable to work in a customer service field you should look for employment elsewhere. Finally, at no point did either waiter apologize for the overcooked steak. Our table was also not the only one with issues. The table to our left had an incorrect dish brought out. The table to our right didn't have one of their dishes come out at all. The customers didn't want to wait for it to be cooked and decided to split the one dish they did receive. How is that acceptable?As for the quality and taste of the steak. It was quite mediocre and disappointing to be honest. I've had better steaks from Outback Steakhouse for a fraction of the price. Even though my steak was cooked between medium rare and medium, it was dry and severely lacking the juiciness expected from a good steak.They tried to make up for it by giving us free dessert that we never asked for.  It was a nice gesture, but quite frankly, an apology would have been more appreciated, or a discount to the check.I have zero intention of coming back to this place. Even if I was gifted some sort of certificate, I would not go. There are so many other phenomenal steakhouses in the city, I'll take my business elsewhere.",1,0,0,Konrad D.,"Astoria, Queens, NY",0,2,0
5.0,7/22/2015,"I came here monday at 9pm 7-20-2015, with my boyfriend for our one year anniversary.  I made the reservations for me and him the day before, and i put ""anniversary"" as a note on the reservation. The place was a bit  hard to find when I got there since the outside is small, but once you get inside it's beyond beautiful and romantic. There was a rose and vintage candle on our table, and a special menu that said Happy Anniversary. The waiter was quick and attentive, he had a russian accent i think lol. Me and my boyfriend are both underage so I got cranberry juice and he got ginger ale, but it was placed in fancy wine cups so we got the adult experience haha. We shared the canadian bacon, and i honestly assumed it'll taste like cardboard but it was soft chewy , had a maple kind of taste yet crunchy, especially with the sweet dipping soft that it was served with. Super delicious. Then for a entree i got the hanger steak medium rare and my boyfriend had the shrimp scampi. The hanger steak was delicious with the sauce it came with but was WAY too chewy, chewy as in my mouth is tired is this a workout? chewy. My boyfriend's shrimp scampi was bomb dot com , it was super huge, buttery, and light. For sides we shared the mac and cheese and it was good, but not soul food good, which is what I am use too. We had the mashed potatoes which were too good, you can tell it's made with fresh potatoes. And lastly we had the garlic herb fries, which I didn't care for. Tasted with them fries was marinating in garlic juice it's whole life. The food deff filled us both up, that we had a whole lot of left overs to take home. On the house was given a lobster ravoli to try, it was decent, but I never cared for Ravoli. And a nice women gave us a dessert that was I think chocolate mouse cake, some coffee flavored cake thing, and a sweet donut type thing. Lol sorry for my rough description of the dessert I didn't really know it was, since it all had chocolate and I'm allergic. It was beautiful and I appreciated it but me and my boyfriend was to full to even eat it haha. It said ""Club A Happy Anniversary"" with a candel lit, and a woman to take a photo of us. The owner spoke to us asking how did we enjoy the food we said it was great. Everything came up to 113$!. I was assuming it'll be way more.

5.0,7/10/2015,"Club A steakhouse is the quintessential destination to woo your lady friend--intimate tables, candlelight, a soft cello in the background. I almost feel like I'm dining in a cheesy couple's retreat pamphlet. But rest assured, the food isn't half bad. The steak is on par with most NYC steakhouses--flank steak, filet mignon, and strip are all decent, but if you want to impress, the porterhouse is best. For the sides--ladies love the truffle Mac & cheese, but my personal favorite was the sautéed spinach. The mushrooms were a little too sour for my taste, but perhaps they were not fresh. For appetizers, I'd skip the calamari as it wasn't anything special, and go for the mushroom ravioli which was given to us on-the-house. Pleasantly surprised and I would definitely recommend. Also on the house was a large platter of desserts--adorned with a thoughtful ""happy birthday"" for me. They took our picture and printed it out for us as a souvenir.

I've never been thanked so much for visiting a restaurant as I did here at Club A. Our waiter was so attentive without hovering, just the right amount of banter without being nosy, and completely on point with his recommendations. The steak rivals other big name restaurants in the city and their prices may even be slightly cheaper. We ordered the bone-in rib eye and their lamb chops to share and oh - my - god. The juiciest, well-season and evenly prepared cuts of meats we've had in a while. Let's not forget the mushroom risotto taster that they brought out with compliments and their dessert of fresh watermelon cubes and a little cake bites plater for dessert, also complimentary! We had our photo taken and framed at the end of the meal - what a nice memento for an already memorable meal!Romantic, dimly lit, extremely hospitable staff and just good, solid steaks - Club A delivers a huge bang for your buck!

The food was everything I imagined it would be, but the service was slightly sub-par and disappointing.First, the positives...The food was very good. The Sizzling Canadian Bacon appetizer lived up to its hype. It was a large, thick cut piece of bacon, and was sweet and caramelized and savory all at the same time. My partner ordered the Rib Eye, and said that it was perfectly seasoned. It was also perfectly cooked, which is something that some steakhouses strangely don't do. I ordered the Braised Short Ribs and they were divine. The meat was tender and came right off the bone, which still had creamy nuggets of marrow for me to scoop out. It came on a bed of saffron risotto, which was a perfect accompaniment.The hostess was very lovely. There was a woman and a man, and they made us feel very welcome. We also had the most wonderful table on the second floor near the windows. It was intimate and romantic and perfect for our special occasion.Now, the negatives...Our actual waiter was strange. He was outwardly unpleasant, but was clearly favoring other tables over ours. We both ordered Manhattans, which he seemed purposefully slow to bring and refill. He actually didn't ask us if we wanted another round after he whisked our half-finished first round away. I understand that a lot of customers want service at a fancy steakhouse to be unobtrusive, but he was almost non-existent for us. For the price, I'm not sure if we would return just for the food.

Our table of 3 ordered the Truffle Mac and Cheese, Creamed Spinach, Calamaris, Canadian bacon, filet mignon, ribeye, and the 20oz T-bone steak special. The Truffle Mac and Cheese was pretty good. I found the Canadian bacon to be very fatty. The T-bone steak special was cooked with a generous portion of butter and was our personal favorite dish of the night. Surprisingly, the filet mignon was my least favorite of the steaks. It's a very lean cut and I asked for it medium rare, but it was the toughest meat I ever had to cut.

5.0,5/5/2015,"Great experience!My husband and I went to dinner at Club A with five of his business associates this evening. We all had 7:00 theater tickets, so made our reservation for 5:00 - right when they open. They were still getting organized when we got there at 5:00 and were very apologetic for the approximately five-minute wait for our table. It's a really nice, comfortably-sized space. The background music ranges from Sinatra to Motown, and it kept at a nice, low volume. (I *hate* having to yell to be heard over the background music.)Once we were seated, the service could not have been more attentive. We told our server that we were under time constraints due to our theater plans, and he accommodated us beautifully. Our cocktails, wine and food were served super-promptly. Additionally, some of our group ordered salads/appetizers, while others did not. Our server brought the latter group a complimentary appetizer of mushroom-filled ravioli. Sadly, I do not eat mushrooms, so put mine on my husband's plate. Next thing I know, our server is back with a mozzarella/tomato appetizer....but I don't eat raw tomatoes either. I did thank him for his efforts. I didn't need the appetizer anyway because the 10-oz filet I ordered was about 2x more than I could eat....even though it was perfect. Everyone raved about their meals.Oh yes - great bread too.Finally, after my husband (the host) told our server that we wouldn't need dessert menus because of our theater plans, our server showed up with a  complimentary plate of assorted desserts.

5.0,5/5/2015,"Club A Steakhouse is by and far one of the best steakhouses that I've ever had the pleasure of going to! I rarely write yelp reviews, but the food, drink, ambience, and service was so outstanding at this place that I felt so indebted to the restaurant that I had to write in. We shared a Cabernet between us, and ordered a variety of steaks and sides as a table. Between 4 of us, we ordered the hash browns, whipped potatoes, creamed spinach, the porterhouse for 2, the filet mignon, and a bone-in strip steak. They were all just heavenly, the wine included, which was recommended by our ever so friendly and attentive server -- who also gave us a delectable dessert sampler on the house! -- most outstanding was the porterhouse steak with a luxurious and decadently velvet butter sauce, it really needed no other sauces; even though we were spoilt for choice in this section with a smattering of sauces at our disposal on the table. Among the sides, my personal favorite were the hash browns with a spicy jalapeno pepper flavor interspersed between the crisp chunks of potatoes in addition to whipped potatoes, a classic choice that's always on the money when it comes to accompanying it's best friend -- steak. I'll definitely be recommending this place to all friends looking for a steakhouse in NYC and will be back the next time I return to NYC!",2,1,1,Jadey H.,"Washington, DC",5,8,2

2.0,4/21/2015,My boyfriend and I went to Club A this past Friday for our anniversary.  I was really looking forward to it since it had gotten such great reviews - I have to say I was very disappointed.  For an appetizer we got the tuna tare tare which was a special for the night.  The tuna was absolutely terrible.  I never send anything back but it was inedible and the waiter took it back.  They were nice about it and took it off the bill.  For our entrees we both had the filet mignon.  The meat was good - not great but it was good.  We got two sauces on the side - a bernaise which was overly salty and a bordelaise which was overly seasoned.  For sides we got the potatoes puree which were somewhat bland but ok.  We also got the brussel sprouts which had a very strong and strange wood burned flavor - neither of us cared for them.  The wine was good and the service was decent.  Overall it was expensive for such a disappointing experience - I would not go back.,2,0,0,Katherine S.,"Manhattan, NY",0,3,0

It is so hard to find a place like this at more than reasonable cost and sincerely genuine service. The steak was perfectly cooked and you didn't need any sauce because of how well the meat was prepared. We also ordered the three-sides combo, and the recommended sautéed asparagus was wonderful. Our other two picks, the truffle macaroni and creamed spinach were super awesome as well. And the DESSERTS!!! The desserts were absolutely amazing!! I loved every bite!! I absolutely can't wait until we go back again!! They were so thoughtful they even thought of things we hadn't considered.

The dressing was creamier and less peppery than most Caesar salads that I'm used to but a good change with a great flavor.The steak was cooked as instructed and needed no complementary sauce even though they provide you with their Club A house steak sauce and also provided me with their au poivre and béarnaise sauce upon my request to simply try them. The sides of whipped potato purée, sautéed asparagus, and broccoli rab were simply good.Due to it being a birthday dinner, they provided us with complementary desserts which was another nice surprise. The staff was generous, attentive, and accommodating. Take note that I brought my 10 month-year-old son and five other adults with me. All in all, the decor, service, and food in total were great.

5.0,4/15/2015,"Service gets an A+ and better yet, so does the food and so does the ambiance! I don't handout five stars to just anybody. But this restaurant is going in the books as the best we've experienced and tasted. This restaurant is definitely engagement, special occasion central... The walls and decor are red with framed photos of celebrities and family. We were kindly greeted by the maître d' and he took our coats. The lighting is romantically dim and each table has a freshly lit candle as people are seated and a fresh beautifully fragranced single rose in a vase. Our waiter, Adrian, was very kind and helpful! The servers made us feel like family and were not one bit pretentious. He recommended the Brussels sprouts, creamed spinach and the truffle Mac and cheese as the side trio ($24). We opted for two of the 24oz ribeyes ($55), the combo of three sides, and the tomato and buffalo salad ($15). We had more than enough food for two couples to share. The menu prices are ideal and not overly expensive for a steakhouse. The ribeye was cooked exactly as we had imagined: crispy, grilled exterior and juicy interior. Perfectly cooked medium rare and as for the other couple, they ordered theirs medium well and to their liking. I can't complain about any of the food. The steak is the best steak I've ever had in comparison to Paris, Firenze, Las Vegas, Beverly Hills, Palm Springs, Santa Ynez, etc... We absolutely made sure to tell our waiter and maître d' and they were grateful for the feedback. The sides were delicious, rich, and flavorful. Not one of them were heavily seasoned which allowed their quality and freshness to shine through. The Brussels sprouts had smokey Canadian bacon that gave a nice richness and were seasoned with thyme - an interesting pairing. The spinach was delicate and rich with a subtle scent of truffle oil. And the Mac and cheese - whoa! The servers came by to check in and all we could respond was ""Wow!!!""  We were given complimentary tastings of porcini mushroom ravioli in cream sauce, whipped potatoes as a side to share, and beyond amazing desserts. The ravioli were perfect al dente and excellent cream sauce! The whipped potatoes were heavenly and satiny. The desserts were homemade and were mind blowing! Not overtly sweet and made with love. Their dessert game is pretty strong and should be visited often! The tastings made us feel very valued as customers and, honestly, showed us that they cook high quality, gourmet food! Other restaurants need to take a hint from this family-owned and operated business. This isn't your typical steakhouse. And in the sea of restaurants in NYC there's a reason why it still stands 35+ years later.

5.0,4/8/2015,"Let's start with the description, steak and American traditional,  true yes, half and half, no.   FINE for me, but if you have picky eaters with you as I did,  they'll basically be left with Mac n Cheese as their only choice, aside from several salad selections, which are all outstanding by the way.  Just don't be mislead into thinking that there are going to be several ""American Traditional"", basic burger and sandwich type selections.      Aside from that,  my 1 and baaaasically only complaint, (other than its a tad too dimly lit for my taste. Had to use the candle light in order to be able to see the, albeit, wonderful menu), I LOVED this place!            Much like yourselves,  we chose it for its 4 stars and 3 $'s (of which the $$$ rating I don't necessarily agree with) but that's hardly their fault, and it ended up being worth every penny!   Yes, it's expensive, but this is FINE dining people.  The staff is excellent at what they do. They are very attentive, extremely personable, and very friendly. Not to mention knowledgeable and not the least condescending or short with folks like myself whom are of a blue collar background and not necessarily well versed when it comes to a more sophisticated menu.  We weren't of the upper class let's say, and you could tell just by our comfortable, casual, tour the city all day in sneakers, type of dress.  That didn't matter to them one bit.  They treated us as if we were Mr.Trump and his family, which I really appreciated more than you know.    In conclusion, if you want to treat yourself and whomever you're with to a special dinner consisting of an AMAZING selection of steak and or seafood, poulty, appetizers, specialty selections, 1000's of wine selections, fresh rosemary table bread, great appetizers and wonderful deserts, all with the service I've previously mentioned,  look no further.  Just also be prepared to pay for what you get!  Worry none as you'll surely soon see,  it is worth every single penny.  Thankyou to the Club A Steakhouse and it's staff for an outstanding,  memorable evening that myself, my Wife and kids will never forget.  And special thanks to the owner who very graciously saw us outside taking pictures and immediately came out to take 4 or 5 from every angle so that I could be in them as well!  Thank You!",0,0,0,Robert K.,"East Greenbush, NY",1,11,16

The steak was cooked unevenly. Parts of the steak was medium well instead of medium rare. The beef was also placed a little too long so the jus and sear turned into a 1/8th layer of black on one side. Slicing past the char, the beef was well seasoned, slightly juicy, and well marbled. The calamari was fried perfectly crispy. Salted and peppered and came with a sweet tomato dipping sauce. The tiramisu was light and spongy. My friend's cheesecake lacked a crunchy graham cracker crust but the cheesecake itself was sweet and had some citrus flavors to whet the appetite. The cheesecake was perfect end to that meaty beefy meal.  Thank you Club A for making a better steak than before!",5,1,1,Doreen L.,"Queens, NY",1214,1020,7030
5.0,3/27/2015,"Celebrated my fiancé's birthday at Club A and they did a spectacular job amazing her with their service, ambiance and food. The reservation was easy to make and by telling them it's for a birthday they provided special menus with a ""Happy Birthday"" message when you arrive. The downstairs seems a bit dim because it goes straight back and not much ambient window light. Luckily we were seated on their second floor which was bright and had large widows facing the street where they had decorated the trees outside with tons of little white Christmas lights. It gave off a very romantic feel to the dining experience. The tables each had long roses and a full length candle stick. It was a picture perfect environment.We ordered their Pernod Escargot with lot of herbs & garlic and Oysters (6) on the half shell for starters.  The escargot were nice and buttery with texture well balanced between soft and chewy.  Oysters were fresh and properly shucked, it even came with half a lemon with a stretch wrap (you know, a hairnet looking sort of cover that you put on a half sliced lemon to catch the seeds and unwanted pulp with).  Alright, enough about shellfish since Club A is first and foremost a steakhouse.  For the main entree we had their Prime Dry Aged Rib Eye and Double Colorado Lamb Chop.  They were both cooked to a nice medium rare.  Pink and juicy on the inside when you cut it open, but didn't have a bloody mess squirting out with every stab or poke of a fork.  Service here was spectacular.  From the time we walked into the restaurant to the time we left (and we literally were the last table on the second floor) the host, servers and busboys were all friendly and jokingly amusing.  The host came by  took a photo for us at the end of the meal and printed us a copy to commemorate our evening at Club A.  Nice little surprises like these made my fiancé feel even more special than she already is.",4,0,1,Louis N.,"New York, NY",375,218,459
3.0,3/26/2015,"I have to say... This place according to Yelp is highly acclaimed. That obviously made this a destination for me and a lady friend. It was between this and The Palm. This has a higher rating, so this was the choice for the night. We walked in starving. And we certainly ordered like we were. First off we get a beer. Customary practice for us. Delirium aka Pink Elephant. Every steakhouse I go to usually starts with a slice of bacon. You know... Thick cut Canadian bacon. It was delicious. We also thought about ordering the crab cake, but our assistant Adrian suggested ordering this appetizer that consisted of crab chunks. Sure why not. There was nothing special about it--literally chunks of crab meat with dipping sauces of cocktail and holandaise. It is what you expect. The meat was fresh and served nicely chilled. For steak we ordered the porterhouse for two medium rare. It was cooked to our preference and came out sizzling as typical for this steak. It was really tender, but the taste simply wasn't there for me. Although charred and  aged, the flavor simply wasn't there. This is nothing against the establishment because it is simply my preference. I didn't get any beef flavor at all. We both agreed it was cooked perfectly, but lacking on the taste buds. For me a great piece of aged steak might get a little salt and pepper added. I had to season it quite a bit for my taste buds. For sides we had mushrooms and had Brussels sprouts with parmesan and bacon. Both were delicious. I recommend without hesitation. For wine we ordered the Sequoia Grove Cabernet Sauvignon 2011. It was as expected, and was worth it. Good complement to the food. The decanter was awesome. Check it out. Cobra Kai style. We also received dessert on the house which consisted of home made cream puffs covered in ice cream, slice of cheesecake, and tiramisu. Simply divine. The home made cream puff was certainly the highlight. The decor is old school beautiful. We sat upstairs by the window which I thought were the best seats in the house. The place is red velvet all over the place reminding me of what a speak easy would be like. Summary:Everything was excellent. The experience is top notch for a high end steakhouse. The porterhouse left some flavor to be desired on the taste buds. Her and I are steak snobs. Verdict:Would we return? Probably. We wouldn't order the porterhouse again though, but the experience, decor, and ambiance will come calling again. Everything else was superb. Will update review and score after another visit.

This place does not compete at any levels with the other big house nyc steakhouses likes del frisco, quality meats, etc. Weak waiter, weak service, weak atmosphere. What is up with the gangster hangout feel? That is so early 90's.Appetizers were just ok, sides were just ok, and most of all steaks were plain and simple lackluster. Yes we will have the owner responding to this post telling us all how much he cares and how much he appreciates the criticism but seriously does it matter? This is simply not up to par to the other steakhouses that are available in the area.No sear on my steak after I asked for it, yeah the free desserts were a nice touch, but I feel that is an emotive move to simply counter the punch of not being able to compete with the other steakhouses.Don't fall for my mistake and book here for something special. While the food is adequate, you can get much better somewhere else. Listen to my review, and book the steakhouse that you are thinking of.

5.0,3/11/2015,Went back to club A steak house with my friends. We were running late(as usual) and they didn't give us any problem about it. The ambiance is amazing. As soon as we walk in we feel so relaxed. We started out with a bottle of red wine1. The Mac and cheese is AMAZING2. The Canadian bacon is AMAZING3. THE mashed potatoes were AMAZING4. The filet mignon was cooked perfectly They also sent us lobster ravioli on the house. THAT WAS ALSO AMAZING. We were so full from our dinner but we couldn't resist getting their cream puffs.

5.0,3/10/2015,This ranks as one of the best restaurants I've been. I've traveled the globe and previously my most memorable steakhouse was in Milan. This just topped the list.

1.0,3/7/2015,"What?!?We walked in with great expectations based off of the raving reviews on Yelp. The red decor and a nice fireplace greeted us upon entrance but our reservation didn't do us any good as we were walked up three flights of stairs to a creaky, drafty room without heat. It felt like we were going up an unmaintained slumlord complex. I kept thinking my wobbly chair would collapse like a deck of cards.We didn't hold back on 'steak night'. We got the Prime Dry Aged Double Eagle Strip Bone-in and the Prime Dry Aged Ribeye. Oysters and sides to boot.Everything about the steak was unquestionably mediocre. We were eating the Ford Taurus of steaks. The crust was a blackened and charred exoskeleton that tasted like ash. Cutting the burnt meat gave my fingers cramps. The meat's flavor was basic, lacking carnality and sophistication. I thought maybe the chef was recovering from a bender as both tables by us complained and sent portions of their meals back.The best part was the puree potatoes as it was creamy and helped cover the taste of the burned beef when walloped on in generous portions. We finished every bit of the potatoes.The staff sent complimentary desserts without prompt, which was nice, but possibly guilt ridden as other tables on our floor also got them.Really, a phenomenal letdown and I'd be a continental liar if I said I expect to come back.",6,2,1,Michael C.,"Los Angeles, CA",48,39,25
4.0,3/6/2015,"One of my favorite steakhouses in New York City. I always come here during restaurant week because their rw menu includes different appetizer options as oppose to the usual salads and soups, and their entree comes with sides which is a great plus. For appetizer I've had their steak tartare and bacon. Both delicious, I love the steak tartares flavor and pairing with the baguette bread makes it the perfect combination. For entree I've had the salmon, the filet mignon, and the sirloin. All of the entrees are delicious and they do not skimp out on portions!!!! By the time you're halfway through your entree you're gonna feel a bit stuff. They serve the sides in small dishes which is great. The mashed potato is a must if you're having steak. The Mac and cheese is super flavorful and goes well with the steak also. The French fries were good but nothing too special. For dessert you should definitely try their tiramisu!!!! I would definitely come to club A even if it's not restaurant week.",0,0,0,Teresa Z.,"New York, NY",171,58,62

Very thoughtful! The porterhouse for 2 was cooked perfectly and the meat was so juicy and tender that my mouth waters just thinking about it. For sides we had the asparagus and brussel sprouts, both were very good. All the desserts were yummy but the chocolate mousse cake was my favorite!

4.0,3/4/2015,"This is possibly the best steakhouse that I had never heard about (until the day I went).  There's a relatively small bar at the front of the restaurant, and two floors of seating area.  The second floor has some eccentric christmas light theme going on...Ordered a rib eye from the regular menu, and will have to say the quality was better than most.  Mine was a nice tender cut with very good distribution of fat, well marbled without significant big chunks.  Nice little char on the exterior, and medium rare as ordered.  Also nice was the complimentary piece of ravioli each of us received to start, and the dessert plate at the end which included cream puffs, tiramisu, and a delectable slice of carrot cake.",0,0,0,Dennis L.,"New York, NY",76,196,1

They decant (in very nice decanters) and pour the wines into excellent wine glasses. They give me the same wine service as if I had purchased a $500 bottle from them.

5.0,3/4/2015,"When the parents come to town, why go somewhere cheap where you'll get only moderate satisfaction?Why order a filet when you can order a 24oz porterhouse? And why go with a second rate wine when you can go with not one, but two bottles of Heitz Cab?Yup, that's exactly how my college-age daughter thinks. And, I gotta admit, that's how I used to think when my parents came to visit me (way) back when I was in school.So, she Googles something like ""Best Steakhouse in NY"" and off we go to Club A. I've been to some great restaurants in NY, and this one absolutely is now on the list.Yes, of course the food is good. Yes, of course they have a great wine list. Yes, of course the service is great.You wanna know what happened? I'm gonna tell you anyway. A filet came to the table ""medium"" rather than ""medium rare"". I apologized for sending it back, but I'd really rather have the waitstaff mad at me than have my wife mad at me (it was her steak). It's maybe the second time I've returned a meal in 25 years. The waiter was GREAT about it...agreed, yes, gray not pink, etc etc. 5-7 minutes later, a new filet, and NO GROUCHINESS.Dessert was comped I believe (totally unnecessary). I say ""I believe"" because my daughter and I consumed 99% of the wine that night and it all gets fuzzy.Go. It's worth getting away from the big name/big chain places.

5.0,2/21/2015,"Perfect for any special occasion. I took my boyfriend here for his birthday recently. Initially, I thought to give it 4 stars. As the night progressed that quickly changed and this place earned 5 stars in my book! We each ordered the Filet Mignon $42. I recommend ordering it medium-rare but everyone has their own preference. The meat was excellent. Juicy and tender like I expected it to be. I asked for their drink menu and they brought over a list of wine bottles. I was disappointed they didn't have a cocktail menu, so I just asked for an ""Old Fashion"" $12. As sides, we ordered the whipped potatoes and mushrooms. Both were delicious but portions were for just 1 person. What made this place incredible, aside from the delicious food was the thoughtfulness they put into the dinner. When I made the reservations, they knew it was for his birthday. They customized our menu to read ""Happy Birthday"" on the top, offered us complimentary mushroom ravioli, and best of all brought over a free birthday dessert with a candle and all. At the end of the night, someone came over with a camera to take a picture. They printed it and handed it back to us with a letter thanking us for our business. It was awesome! The photo looked great and sitting on my dresser now. Although they have minor improvements to make, I'm grateful they made my boyfriend feel so special. I had a wonderful time. FYI, bill was around $155 plus tip. Not too bad for everything we got and the quality of the food. Thumbs wayyy up!!!I will be returning.",11,1,5,Yanill P.,"Manhattan, NY",574,355,1286

5.0,2/12/2015,"Amazing! This place is as old school &Mom Pop as it gets. It's not your typical steakhouse or even restaurant for that matter in NYC. First of all its in a brownstone with real wood burning fireplaces. The 2nd floor has an amazing view by the window (make sure you ask to sit there). I've been here a bunch of times with my wife & many times with my co-workers. It's family owned & operated by Bruno, the owner, who has instilled his traditional hospitality in his staff (he's been at this location for for over 30 years I believe). Everyone is friendly & warm here. From the moment you walk in & are greeted to the busser that brings you bread to the servers that care, you will feel comfortable & relaxed. We just love this place! The steak is as good as it gets. I had the porterhouse for 2 (medium rare) and it was awesome! I'm a steak lover& I asked where they get their steaks from, my server JT told me they get it from a guy known as ""Sam the butcher"". Whoever Sam is, thank you because your meat is awesome.

5.0,2/8/2015,"Went yesterday as an early anniversary celebration. I let the restaurant know ahead of time and the service was truly outstanding. We were immediately greeted and wished a Happy Anniversary throughout the evening. They even provided us special menus wishing it to us as well. We started off with the calamari and escargot which was great. We were provided complimentary bread as an accompaniment, which I appreciated to enjoy with the cheesy garlic oil leftover from the escargot. The tbone was suggested for me and the rib eye for my boyfriend. As much as I hate well done steak, i prefer medium rare to medium, my boyfriend loves it. He was suggested by the waiter to get medium instead. I enjoyed my medium but as he got more towards the center it was a little more red than he liked so I don't think he got to enjoy it as much. He was full regardless, so we took it home to enjoy today. Also towards the beginning he didn't get a water until halfway through our second course, which should've been a little more consistent. They also provided a complimentary mushroom ravioli that was great, almost like a cream of mushroom soup. I loved the bearnaise sauce, it was delicious. Our sides, mashed potatoes were light, the truffle mac and cheese was delicious and the asparagus a lovely light accompaniment to our steak. This was probably one of the best steaks and experiences I've ever had. At the end we were given a complimentary dessert wishing us a Happy Anniversary. We have a beautiful picture, and a letter thanking us for coming there for our event. I plan to come here again for many years and special occasions.

5.0,1/15/2015,"Best steakhouse I've eaten in so far. Nice subtle decor with a live jazz band usually playing in the background at perfect volume. I have been there twice and both experiences were amazing front the moment you enter to when you leave. Everyone there is very friendly and super attentive. I only had to look at the waiter and he would come right away to see if I wanted anything. I've always been seated right away but I also did have reservations. The food is phenomenal and very rightly priced for the quality. They could bring up the prices and I'd still pay with a big smile on my face. For appetizers I've had the rich and succulent Canadian bacon that is very nicely smoked and comes to you sizzling still. I've also had the shrimp cocktail; which is making my mouth water just thinking about (the tartar sauce is heaven). Of course if you go there you must have the porter house and if you don't then go back again and have it. It was cooked exactly how I want and was to die for. I've also had the double eagle strip which was also amazing. The creamed spinach and the Mac and cheese aioli are both a must have or else you'll regret it. So as for the food it's amazing. They definitely know how to treat their customers and make sure everything is perfect. I've always seen the manager or waiter,I'm not sure, sit at every open table and see if there is enough space between tables or if the seating could be arranged better so that the customer is comfortable. Oh and they always give you something complimentary from an appetizer or dessert.

3.0,1/11/2015,"Disappointing.  We were there on a Saturday night and the live music was so loud that we couldn't carry on a conversation.  When the musicians took a break, the piped-in music was also too loud.  We told the waiter about the music but that had no effect.   When I want to go out to hear music, I'll go to a club.  I was also unfortunate enough to be seated in a seat that had all of the waiters and busboys reaching over me to pour water, deliver appetizers, main courses, etc.  They never apologized nor did they take into account whether I was speaking, eating, drinking, etc.My food was fine but the experience was not worth the money.",0,0,0,Beth L.,"Manhattan, NY",0,11,0

4.0,1/10/2015,"Came here to have an early birthday celebration for the beau. I recommend making a reservation here, it got really packed. We got the lobster ravioli. It's an entree dish but we got it as an appetizer dish (i know, we're fatties). It was delicious and I don't regret it one bit! Lots and lots of lobster meat stuffed into about 8 large raviolis, I definitely felt like I got my money's worth with this plate. My bf Eric T. got the special of the night, a 16oz filet mignon aged 28 days, super flavorful, cooked to the perfect medium rare temperature, very juicy and tender, just excellent! I followed Yelp's suggestion of the Hanger Steak and asked for it Medium rare but it definitely came out Well-done, some parts of Medium Well.... tooo overcooked for me, made it super chewy. I got too tired of chewing and kind of gave up LOL! Def still some great flavor though and came with a nice sauce on the side. For your birthday they bring out a complimentary dessert plate, actually consisted of 3 different desserts, which were all very delicious! Overall, it is a super romantic spot located walking distance to Central Park. We had a great seat by the window which had an amazing cute little view of the neighborhood. The service here is great!

1.0,1/2/2015,"This review is more on service than food.My wife and I went here for our inaugural 1st dinner of 2015. We ""brought"" a bottle of wine and decided to pay the corkage fee of $25.We ordered the escargot, garlic fries, brussel sprouts and rib eye to share (MP $54 for the rib eye).We had our wine uncorked and escargot came out in a jiffy.As we enjoyed our time, the escargot (BTW tasted like it was fresh from the can) was finished, eventually with 2 hrs passed the bottle of wine was done. No food, none zip whatsover. Ambience was loud and the jazz music they were playing over their cheap speakers would have 1 min lag between songs, weird and would create odd moments of silence, especially when other patrons would notice no music and there would be a moment of silence every 5 min or so.We decided to ask our bus boy when our food would arrive since our server never checked on us. I could see him asking the server who then came by and stated the food would come in 2 min. Tick tock...tick tock, with our bellies grumbling I saw him walking by again and I had to flag him down to inform him that its been 15 min since I last saw him, given my frustration, I informed him we were done and wanted our check.He came by 10 min later with a slab of meat that looked crisply overcooked and burnt and said, ""look here is your food!"" I told him we were no longer interested and told him to just bring us our check.After speaking with the manager he came back and said, ""your check is on the house!"" Oh geez, thanks, we drank our own wine and we ate the $2 can of escargot. Awesome! We spent 2 hours of our time for $25!!!! Thats like...minimum wage! SCORE!As we were leaving at the stairway the manager literally ""bumped"" by shoulder and said, ""sorry 'bout that""Really!?! For a place that charges $50 or more per steak should have better service. I can grab a nice piece of steak at my local butcher for 1/4 of that price, I go to places like Club A for the food, ambience and service. What a disappointment!!!!All in all....definitely NOT a high end restaurant as stated by other Yelpers! and should be rated 1/5 if any stars.....soo disappointed by the Yelpers! giving this place such praise, what a disappointment.Too many restaurants in NYC to compromise for a place like this.If I were you, go somewhere else...As we all know, a special dinner can easily be ruined by poor service as it was in my case!",3,1,1,Paul K.,"New York, NY",4,45,1

Our waiter didn't even bother to give us the wine menu or run through the specials. If I wanted this kind of service I would just go eat at a diner. I mean I literally had to flag down random waiters and bus boys just to get refills, steak knives for our food and check. If the food was amazing perhaps I could overlook the poor service. But my hubs filet was clearly overcooked. He literally cut around the overcooked areas which left very little meat to eat. If our waiter was around he would have clearly noticed the problem.

It worked well for a group Christmas dinner, I can see it working even better for Valentine's Day.  Any other day, it would creep me out.  Am I getting pulled into Dracula's den? I would avoid this place for any first dates, it is a bit much.It was nice that they were able to accommodate a large group of 10, but beware - leaning on any end of the round table will tilt it.The beginning of the service rubbed me off the wrong way. As we were squeezing into our seats, the table next to us gave me the death stare as I may have bumped into him. That may be fine, but the waiter seemed to take his side and that irked me.  Felt like we were getting dirty looks through the entire dinner. Furthermore, I was missing an entire place setting.  Their forks and knives were not set up in an organized manner, everyone was confused whose forks, knives and plates were whose.  As for the food, our steak was pretty good but wasn't as flavorful as I had hoped.  The sides were all okay, nothing stood out to me too much.  The truffle mac and cheese barely had any truffle flavor to it.They were very patient with us when we spent half an hour opening Secret Santa gifts and even came with complementary dessert (HUGE plates).",1,1,1,Diana C.,"Queens, NY",249,383,268
4.0,12/29/2014,"Came here for a holiday dinner with my significant other this past weekend. Made a reservation a week in advance requesting a table in the main dining room by the wall. When we got there, the rude host (tall, thin guy) had us sent upstairs. He obviously didn't look at our reservation notes. This is one of the 2 reasons I'm taking a star off. So we were taken upstairs and it was packed. And the tables are a lot closer together than in the dining room. It's like a lounge, not a dinner atmosphere. I refused to sit up there and asked to be seated downstairs per my reservation. The hostess asked the owner if it was okay and the owner himself took us downstairs to a table exactly where I had originally requested (he obviously looked at our reservation notes unlike the jerk hippie host). So once seated it was all good. The owner Bruno introduced himself and is an extremely pleasant man. Before I get to the food, the other reason I'm taking a star off is because the bathrooms are WAY too small for this caliber of a restaurant. There are 2 urinals with no divider and a tiny sink. It's just not acceptable for a restaurant where the service and food are 5 stars. So those are my reasons I'm only giving this 4 stars and it pains me to do so because the food and service are impeccable. THE FOOD!We started with oysters on the half shell, the fried calamari and the canadian bacon. I don't know how to put into words how amazing all 3 were. The oysters were insanely tasty and fresh and good size. The calamari was perfectly seasoned and werent overally breaded. They had a nice peppery flavor to the batter. And the canadian bacon, well I don't even know how to describe except to just say ""A Must Get"". Then we both had the Filet Mignon plus the broccoli rabe, steamed spinach and whipped potato puree. All were great. They have a 3 sides for $24 deal which I thought was good. The steaks were cooked to perfection (medium rare). Nice and red on the inside with a crispy seer on the outside. Have not had a better Filet Mignon anywhere and that includes Lugers, Mortons, Christos, etc. This is the best Steakhouse hands down food wise.I was disapointed because we didn't get the complimentary appetizer or our picture taken which I had read so much about but that's just because I had read about people getting those but certainly can't hold that against them. We did receive complimentary deserts. A beatufiful fruit platter and a tray of small deserts which were very good. We had cocktails as well, martini's and mojitos and they were both excellent. I also had an irish cream coffee which was amazing. The decor here is also incredible. Nice red walls and dimly lit. The waiter service was fantastic. They also have live music in the dining room which was fantastic. I would not recommend the upstairs if you are on a romantic dinner. It's very loungy and everyone seemed to be staring at each other. It was a weird vibe. Definitely sit in the main dining room. Just get rid of that douche host and expand the bathrooms like they should be and this would be a 10 star.",0,0,0,Master T.,"Manhattan, NY",0,44,1

The steaks were cooked just right each time: crispy on the surface, but juicy and tender on the inside. The seafood platter was amazing: fresh, sweet, succulent! Portions were big too! They had a nice wine list with wine from everywhere and Napa (my favorite as cabs are best for steaks!) at a very good price range.What's special about it is also the level of service. My friends and I feel like A-list each time we go. The staff are well-trained, funny and attentive. Bruno is the owner and he goes around checking on his customers all the time.

1.0,12/22/2014,Really sorry to say so but we got highly dissapointed. Waiter and overall service can be overlooked but if you pay +300$ for dinner you at least expect good food. Convinced my wife to have a filet mignon which was burnt outside and tough as a nail inside though it was ordered medium (rare). waiter even made us cut the steak in half to check if it was cooked properly. Which steak joint does that. trust your kitchen staff that cooks probably more than a hundred steaks a day. my ribeye was bitter burnt as well but had more flavour thanks to the fat. overall highly disappointing. Next time just stick to Peter Luger. Might be hard to get a reservation but you will know what you get. top notch quality steak. compared to that joint here. Big disklike.

3.0,12/22/2014,"My uncle and his friend were in visiting from abroad, and when they asked me to bring them to a good steakhouse, I chose this place based on yelp ratings and reviews. The ambiance and decor were gorgeous, but to put it bluntly, I was very disappointed with the food.Appetizers: Don't get the escargot; it was way too salty. The smoked salmon was well portioned for 4 people and it was good. The crab cake was good, but nothing spetacular.The steaks were served with a tag that indicated how well they were cooked. I ordered a medium filet mignon, but it was more a well done steak. The outer surface was burnt and very salty, but the inside of the steak didn't have much flavor. It was also extremely dry. I wouldn't recommend it. My cousin ordered the NY Strip steak medium-rare, and THAT was the consistency of a medium steak. It was good and I was sad I didn't order that instead. My uncle got the rib eye, which he enjoyed, but again he asked for medium, but got more of a well-done steak.Tip: for the steak, order 1 level down in cooked style from what you usually enjoy.Service: AMAZING. We got complimentary dessert, for which we were thankful.Portions were very generous.Note for bar: They don't have cocktail menus; you tell them spirits you like and they concoct something for you.",1,0,0,Jing Jing G.,"Manhattan, NY",88,65,12

As for the food, Canadian bacon was kinda chewy and thick, in my opinion. It didn't get cooked long enough and into the fat...thus making it tough and hard to eat. Escargot was alright and dry aged rib-eye was quite flavorful, but didn't like the burnt char and different sauce that came with the steak. The rib-eye was good on its own without anything. All servings came with good portions. Even got complimentary mushroom ravioli and desserts.

Honestly, it was a nice cut of meat, but I've had better. I have not, however, had a steak that was as well prepared...perfect. Asparagus was excellent, whipped potatoes were outstanding and the creamed spinach was average, a little salty. They had a good selection of wine by the glass which is great for us since my wife and I have very different tastes.

5.0,12/11/2014,"Amazing! Everything here is immaculate. Arrived on a whim with a girlfriend of mine and sat by the bar planning to just have a drink or two as we were headed downtown for a girls night out. We both had vodka and sprite that were poured with a heavy hand (who doesn't like that?). As conversation grew and we smelled the amazing aroma in the air, we decided to eat here. Although they were eager to sit us where ever we desired, we decided we wanted to eat by the bar. Our bartender was a nice young lady who sparked conversation with us and we figured why move? Bread basket was brought to us as soon as we decided to eat here. For starters, French Onion soup and a Caesar. I am a French onion soup connoisseur, as it is my favorite, and it was delicious. My girlfriend had the Caesar that she would not stop ""mmmmm""-ing at so I had a bite and again, delicious. Perfect amount of dressing and seemed to be very crispy and fresh. We got the hanger and filet mignon. For sides we decided on whipped potato puree aka mashed potatoes and the truffle mac and cheese. We split the sides and were not disappointed with either of them. The potatoes tasted like they had just the right amount of butter and a great consistency. Since I am a huge fan of truffle, the mac and cheese made me quite happy. You could actually taste the distinct taste of truffle. My steak, the hanger, which is usually a chewier piece of meat was absolutely delicious. Ordered at a medium that Club A executed perfectly. The filet mignon came and went in under 10 minutes. She loved it. Each of our steaks were seasoned and cooked perfectly. Its very easy to distinguish a quality piece of meat and this was one of the best steaks I have ever had. The owner of the establishment came over to ensure that we were happy with our meal and of course we assured him that we were more than pleased. The time to go came and we asked for the bill. I was pleasantly surprised to see the numbers because I had assumed it would be more than what it was. Price is good for an NYC steakhouse of this magnitude.

4.0,12/9/2014,"While on open table seeing where is available on a Monday night, this place came up. I was CRAVING a steak and this seemed like just the place to not only satisfy the craving, but have a great ambiance as well. It was my boyfriend's birthday and I wrote that in the comments - so on the menu it said ""Happy Birthday!"" They really cater to their customers!When looking at the menu, I wasn't sure what to get so I just decided on the Mixed Grill for two which came with 10oz Filet mignon, 8oz lamb chop split, 12oz veal strip steak & sweet and hot Italian sausage (we changed the italian sausage out a hanger steak) as well as the truffle mac and cheese and the whipped potatoes (suggestions of almost all yelp reviews).Mixed grill for two: the meat was cooked to perfection and was seasoned very well. The veal was not as tasty as the other meats, but even being the least tasty on the plate, it was still good. Everything was cut for us. It definitely satisfied the steak craving!! The only thing that was odd was they gave us an odd tasting mint jello to go with the lamb - even the waitor was a bit confused by this.Mac and cheese: I was a little disappointed in the mac and cheese - it was good (don't get me wrong) but perhaps it wasn't the best decision on our part to pair with the rest of the meal. Whipped potatoes: O - M - G, it was so good. I think we ended up licking the bowl when the spoon couldn;t get anything else (just kidding, but looking back I sort of wished we had)Wine: we ended up getting a bottle of wine (I am no wine connoisseur so I won't go into detail) but if you buy a bottle they pour it into a decanter (each one is a different exotic shape) which helps to airrate the wine and also acts as a really cool decoration.Dessert - Tiramisu and cream puffs - although I am not a fan of dessert, this was really good and was really big.Ambiance: The decorations are very different from a traditional steak house. No description is really necessary because there are so many pictures above. But the candle light/lighting was dark enough to be romantic but light enough to still be able to read everything. The only thing I thought was a little odd, was that there were mirrors on the walls - like full wall mirrors.The waitor was good and helped with a wine selection and did not hover. Bathroom: I went to the bathroom on the second floor and it was very clean.Prices: I think for a fancy steak house, the prices are pretty reasonable for the amount of food you get",3,0,0,Dana M.,"New York, NY",114,312,130

Tiramisu and cheesecake was good as well, but the cream puff was drizzled with chocolate frosting or something .... Or was it melted ice cream???? I couldn't tell because I was so full of puffs.The second floor has very nice wall art. Felt like I was in a mini forest when I went up for the restroom. Restroom was very cramped sadly. But it's ok, because you're only in bathroom for a few minutes. As long as the dining area was pretty, it's fine!",6,2,4,Jennifer A.,"Flushing, NY",305,328,502

5.0,12/3/2014,"This steakhouse is my new go to place for steaks in Manhattan. The service and consistency of the food is so great. I have been here several times and have not been disappointed. Small bar near the entrance and also a small service bar upstairs.  The star here is the food and how you are treated. Complimentary stuffed ravioli with porcini mushroom with a cheesy truffle sauce. Incredible!  The wait staff and manager checking in to make sure everything is ok. I love that!  I have tried their  rib eye, boned in filet, veal chop, osso bucco, hanger steak and T bone steaks. The food and service is very consistent and that is the true mark of a great restaurant.  The Club A hash brown is good change from the mash or baked potato. Sautéed broccoli rabe was done perfectly with slight crunch in them. I was told by a friend that this place was the real deal. I am a believer.

4.0,11/27/2014,"3.75 stars (if i can do that) Went with my GF to dinner last night. 5 yr ann. Let me just start by saying that the staff is very friendly and we were congratulated by almost everyone we passed. We began with the escargot and the club A salad. The escargot was alright, but not a truly memorable dish. The salad was very good. As my lady put it, it reminded her of an adult blt. It had nice chunks of bacon, tomatoes, onions, and shrimp. Simple but tasty and well executed. For the sides we had brussel sprouts, creamed spinach, and the truffle mac and cheese. The creamed spinach and mac and cheese were both good. The one downside to the whole meal was the brussel sprouts. They were bombarded with dry oregano, and unfortunately it's all you could taste. If not for the oregano, it would have been probably my favorite side. But side schmide. This is a steakhouse, no?! Let's talk about the stars of the meal. The true highlight. I had the Ribeye and my lady had the Strip. Both steaks were cooked perfectly. Beautiful crust on the outside and nice and juicy flavorful steak underneath. I wanted to try the wagyu tomahawk but it was not available. Moments later, a waiter came over to apologize for not having the tomahawk. We also received complimentary mushroom ravioli and dessert, a nice added touch. While the place is not cheap, it is actually very reasonable for other steakhouses in the city. We also had 2 glasses of champagne and 2 of wine. Overall, it was a memorable and enjoyable experience. Definitely a steakhouse i would return to. I've had equally good steak at other places, but in NY where great steak is not hard to come by, the service and small nuances make the difference, and Club A succeeded in that aspect. Go treat yourself. ENJOY!!!",1,0,0,Sebastian H.,"Kearny, NJ",739,297,398
4.0,11/27/2014,"Pretty good. My friends and I visited Club A Steakhouse for my birthday. We were traveling about 2 hours away from this restaurant and was not familiar with the area. As a result we were about a 1/2 hour late for our reservation. The restaurant was very accommodating after hearing how far we had traveled just to be there. Pros- we were seated very fast after our entire party arrived. The service was fast. We Had the opportunity to try their ravioli app for free. The wait staff was very helpful in choosing a tasty meal. The food was very flavorful. Drinks were VERY strong. You could tell they were giving you the ""good stuff"". Cons- we were the ONLY table that did not have a table cloth and that bothered me a ton. I did not make a big deal about it bcuz I'm a strong believer that when u make their (meaning the staff's) lives difficult they make your experience not that great. That is really my only con and my reason for four stars instead of five. We were a party of 5 and the bill was just over $500 but that was expected. I wouldn't advise you come here if your on the $20 budget because that won't even buy you a steak here. The steak was perfectly cooked. I had the fillet migon and asked for it well done and was very surprised because usually when you ask for that type of cook on a steak it comes back burnt but they cut it open and cooked it almost like a butterfly so it was cooked perfectly on all sides. THE MASHED POTATOES  were the best thing I ever tasted. They were perfect and I highly recommend. Their veggies suck! If it weren't for the fact that I like to eat a balanced meal I would've passed on that. The dessert was not great either. They surprised me with a chocolate dessert for my birthday which was awesome but never asked if I had any allergies. It just so happens that I'm allergic to chocolate so couldn't eat the dessert much and had to give it to my friends. We were a little loud by the end of the night (too many drinks) so we left a nice tip. Well at least I thought I was nice. Almost $100 bucks to the waiter lol. Overall, I would recommend. Reservation is needed. We came on a Tuesday and there was a pretty packed crowd. If your a light weight drinker like me and my friends I would say stick to one drink and stay away from the shots.

5.0,11/25/2014,"A bona-fide 5-star steakhouse that delivers everything you want. Food, service, ambiance, the experience, everything about it is first class. There are a lot of great steak experiences awaiting you in the city. Here's what makes this one stand out in my mind. There was no bullshitting this steak. When you know they've drowned it in excess butter and salt to bring out the beef taste that's your first clue something is wrong. No such thing here. The whipped mashed potatoes. I expected to get a calorie gut bomb that's half butter half potato. Nope, again, cream and milk and sparing on the butter, just the right amount of salt. A great accompaniment that served as a vegetable instead of a food weapon of mass stomach destruction. The steamed broccoli was actually, steamed broccoli done to perfection (OK, OK, we had to order something to justify that huge hunk of meat).Starter: Canadian bacon at $5 was a steal. A massive slice of pork perfectly delivered, smokey, juicy, tender, succulent. Thoughts of a private Meg Ryan moment flashing before your eyes as you consume.The evening was made extra special for me personally when I located a bottle of 2012 Angels' Share Shiraz from Australia's Two Hands Winery, at $75 I thought under-priced by NYC standards. Boom! The perfect addition to those juicy steaks with a long dark ruby finish. I had the Filet Mignon at 16 oz. while my business meeting friend had the 24 oz. Ribeye. Yes, we traded slices, both top-notch.And just when we thought it couldn't get any better, a complimentary dessert platter with Tiramisu, light cheesecake and a few scattered pieces of fresh fruit. Again, evidence that quality instead of overloading you with sugar and butter is in line. The perfect ending, accompanying espresso shots contained just the right amount of crema. There's nothing missing here.If you come:- Definite date destination, or business as was my case.- Not necessarily formal but take a shot at your best on if you're on a date dumb ass. This isn't Kansas.- Pricey? Yes, but well in line. Have spent far more at other NYC steakhouses that delivered less. The bill (I paid), just over two Franklins before tip.- Expect professional, polite service, not pretense.- Leave the camera in your coat (with the flash off, please) and enjoy the moment.  Plenty of others have already photographed (intended for the European couple at the table next to us).",4,2,1,Scott T.,"Lawrence, KS",346,967,2293

I thought that was a nice touch. Our waiter, Bryan, was very knowledgable and friendly. We sat right by the window, where the trees outside are lit with lights. Our table also had a candle and rose. Very romantic!We ordered the calamari as an appetizer. It was cooked perfectly! It had a nice crispness to it, not overcooked or over seasoned. For our entree we had the porterhouse steak for 2. It was awesome. Super filling even though it's meant for two people; my boyfriend and I couldn't finish the whole thing. We were then given an assortment of complimentary dessert. The chocolate mousse cake was to die for, definitely my favorite.I'd give this restaurant 4/5 stars if just being based on food. The extra 1 star is for their impeccable service. They really do go above and beyond to make sure you have an amazing experience dining with them. Our waiter was attentive, and even if he was not around, I noticed other waiters would occasionally walk around as well to see if anyone needed anything.

I came here for an anniversary dinner, definitely a place you go to for a special occasion. Great romantic atmosphere, but pricey as hell.We started with the canadian bacon. The service was great, good pacing! Plus, when we told them that we wanted to share everything. They were nice enough to split the dishes onto two plates when possible. The canadian bacon was PHENOMENAL. Actually, the most delicious piece of meat I've ever had - so good. For our entrees, we ordered NY strip steak and veal with some house red wine. The steak was good but nothing to write home about (and with that bill, it should blow my socks off). And the veal, we couldn't even finish the veal, not only because it was enormous - but also because it was way too salty. The entrees were slightly (steak) to incredibly (veal) disappointing. I would come back though. The service is incredible! We got complimentary ravioli and complimentary dessert platter. That's what makes people come back... And the economist in me knows that really I paid for it in my bill but yet this unexpected positive externality definitely makes me a lot happier than I should be... Hey, everyone likes free stuff!

3.0,11/7/2014,"On a Friday night, we arrived a bit earlier for our 8:30 reservation and was seated right away upstairs....sounding good so far...As we were seated, they gave us a birthday menu, thanks to the date who had told them it was my birthday...the menu was the same just with a happy birthday greeting on the top. how sweet :)We decided to go with the three appetizers for $24 (selections varied from Brussels sprouts, garlic herb fries, truffle mac and cheese and so forth), the aged rib eye steak, Canadian bacon, and the escargots. also, paired with our choice of red wines! When the escargots and Canadian bacon came, it looked as delicious as it sounded and it certainly did! The Canadian bacon came with a sauce (similar to Peter Lugers steak sauce) and the escargots were full of garlic, olive oil, and butter! mmm mmm mmm! The escargots is a must get! It comes with many escargots (I would say 10 or so) and I usually dip it with the bread provided to us. It was full of flavor in every bite. Here comes the part where my visit became 5 stars to 3 stars...Then, the appetizers of truffle Mac and cheese, creamed spinach and Brussels sprouts came along with the aged rib eye steak with the club a steakhouse sauce. As we cut through the steak, it was just well done. So, we asked for the waiter to come over and take a look at our steak. He seemed a bit unacknowledged so he took it back to the kitchen along with our sides (possibly to keep warm until we got our steak). Within 5 minutes, another aged rib eye came to our table along with the sides...boy that was quick (not sure if it is a good or bad thing). Immediately, we cut it down the middle like our waiter had told us to do while standing next to us. We were unclear because it was a tad bit pink and well done...not sure between the two. Then, our waiter asked the manager to come over. Again, it seemed like the waiter was unsure how to answer our question of whether or not this was medium or well done. The manager came over, he told us this was medium and this is what it looked like. Being that we were starving waiting for our steak and sides to come, we agreed and started eating. The steak was paired with the club a steak sauce which tasted like Peter Luger sauce, in my opinion. The truffle Mac and cheese was wonderful and full of truffle flavor so that was definitely a plus! The creamed spinach was creamy and light and every bite felt like it melted in your mouth. The Brussels sprouts came with bacon and Parmesan cheese...I wouldn't recommend this. It was lacking flavor. After a couple of minutes, I asked for the bordelaise sauce (red wine reduction sauce), but it took 10-15 minutes to come. I mean, with enough waiters, it should come quicker than that. The steak was getting colder and fat started to accumulate and I was still waiting for the sauce... just made me not want to eat it anymore. Thanks to the sweet date, he had told them it was my birthday and they had a complimentary dessert prepared for me. It was a nice gesture of the restaurant. a lady came by and took a picture for us to take home. Overall, the manager made sure that they apologized for having the steak come well done with two glasses of red wine on the house, but our waiter seemed uneducated about the meat rareness which caused some delay.

Nevertheless, it is still fancy and still offers all the top notch services that a steakhouse offers. While walking into this place, there was a live singer that was playing the piano at the same to really set the mood of this place. Dim lights, candle lit, romantic setting was the ambiance of this place. The items i tried were: Rib eye steak: This steak was good. The first few bites were amazing, however, after the 5th bite or so, for some reason it got hard and lacked some kind of taste. New York Steak: I didn't quite like this cut because i thought the meat wasn't so tender. Prime Old age steak: This cut was very juicy and tender. Even when I ate it the next day, it was still very tender. Mac and Cheese: Not good Steak tartare: Not good Hash brown potatoes: Not goodOverall, I thought the food was good, but not amazing. The sauces they gave to dip in was not tasty at all. The sides were bland and not good. The steaks were good, but wasn't amazing. The service was superior. I like the wine ports that they serve wine in, it was different and cool. The dessert at the end was a surprise and most of the items were good, but I am not a huge dessert person.

2.0,11/1/2014,"I was recently sent a list from a friend with the top five steakhouses that are a must try in NYC.  I had been to four out of the five and Club A was the one I hadn't been to.  So naturally, I did what any sane person would do and went on opentable to make a reservation for that weekend.  Needless to say I had very high expectations for this steakhouse.When you first walk in it is the bar area which has about ten seats tops, and was very busy when we arrived.  Keep making your way forward and you'll find the hostess station near one of their dining rooms with just tables, no booths, and a old-school steakhouse kind of feel.  We checked in and were brought to a couple two-tops upstairs and were told we had our choice as to which one we wanted.  We took one by a wall/the top of the steps.What I didn't notice till later on was that our table is also right next to the server station, but I'll get to that later.  The upstairs area had a more spacious feel with floor to ceiling windows on the street-side and felt very romantic with the beautiful lights on the trees outside; not to mention the single red rose on every table or the single lit candle.  There are large booths upstairs available.We were handed food menus by the hostess, and after we were greeted by our server we were then asked if we would like to see the wine menu.  Usually we get that menu first, so it felt weird having to wait for it.  The server got us a wine menu and we ordered a very delicious bottle of Chianti, which was about $90.  We also were given our choices of water and a bread basket which contained a good variety.As for the food we ordered the following:- Royal A Platter: Very delicious, fresh, large portions, and great dipping sauces.- Lentil Soup (Soup of the Day): Was good but nothing great or special, it was fully blended together with no pieces of lentil or veggies to be seen.- Canadian Bacon: AMAZING!!  Hands down the BEST bacon appetizer I've ever had at any steakhouse.  It was the perfect balance of fat to meat, smokey, cooked to perfection, and the Club A sauce that it comes with is on point.- Filet Mignon: When they served us this dish they had us do something no other steakhouse has ever done.  They had us cut it open so we can verify that it was cooked exactly the way we wanted, which was great because it shows that they care about their product but a little nerve-wreaking since you have both the server and runner watching you do this.  None-the-less the steak was cooked PERFECTLY and tasted amazing on its own.  The Club A sauce, once again did go great with it, but the mushroom sauce was not very good.- Creamed Spinach: OK.  Not very creamy as it was watery but had a good taste.  Wouldn't order it again though.- Whipped Potatoes: Very creamy and tasted great, although I wish it came with something else; e.g. green onions, sour cream, bacon, etc.  It was kind of plain so I ended up adding some Club A steak sauce on it to help boost the flavor.- Garlic Herb Fries: Soft and oily, I assume the fryer wasn't at the right temperature when they tried to cook these.  They did taste OK though and not to much Garlic or Herb as to not take away from the steak.During the meal we were given a few dishes on the house: a single mushroom ravioli and a dessert platter.  Both of which I was not able to have a single bite of.  So people with CD (Celiac Disease) beware, they do not have any GF desserts nor do they even try to really accommodate.  You need to know what you can and can't order and expect to get a nasty look as well.The ambiance, as I stated earlier, felt romantic except for the fact that by sitting next to the server station we were subject to a few things we were not expecting.Examples?  Here are a few:- Some of the bussers was constantly huffing and puffing every second they walked by to grab something- Another staff member kept cussing at fellow employees- I noticed an employee bring out clean glasses from the back area which were stacked up to his chin, and he was USING HIS CHIN to help prevent the cups from falling.  His chin was INSIDE the top cup, which he placed on the counter with the other clean cups to be given to a patron.- Constant chatter and inappropriate comments from the staff- Having to constantly push in our chairs or lean forward because the staff was getting in each other's way causing some major ""traffic"" behind our tableIn the end the meal cost about $290 with tip and tax; and we probably will never be back.  I've received better service at diners and the majority of the food was nothing to rave about.  IF I ever do return I would probably just sit at the bar for a drink and a couple orders of bacon.  But I will never want to spend close to $300 on mediocre food and service again.",9,3,5,Pia V.,"New York, NY",1913,894,1648

4.0,11/1/2014,"On our last night on holiday in New York we decided to treat ourselves to a fancy meal and as we both love steak we chose to go to Club A Steakhouse as it had fantastic reviews and wasn't too far from our hotel. It's such a pretty restaurant. We were seated upstairs where you could see sparkling fairy lights on the trees outside and a candle was lit on our table. The decor was beautiful but the music jumped around too much. To begin with it was wonderful classic music gently playing in the background which was perfect for the surroundings and ambiance. After a while it jumped to some 60's rock and roll, then to modern charts and the volume increased. There was then a bit more classic music thrown in. Very bizarre!The service was incredibly slow and it's for this that it lost a star. One guy only seemed to be topping up water glasses and when we said we were still waiting to give our order and see the wine list he had to go and find someone else. Eventually we got a wine list and then it took ages to order our wine and food. There was a huge bread basket with a great variety on the table but we weren't given side plates although other tables had them. There was also a long gap between ordering and getting our food. The staff were very friendly and polite so I definitely wouldn't fault them on that, it was just very slow.The wine was very good. My boyfriend had lovely Chianti and I had a really refreshing and easy to drink sauvignan blanc.We didn't order starters but they brought out a complimentary mushroom raviolli piece each (yep, just one piece!) which was ok but I don't like mushrooms.I was beginning to think that I'd be writing a 2 or 3 star review on this restaurant but the main course we ordered changed all that! We had the porterhouse steak for two with garlic fries, truffle mac 'n' cheese and creamy wilted spinach with the au poivre sauce. WOW! The steak was perfectly cooked for us (rare) and it was incredible. The best steak I've ever had. It was so succulent, tender and tasty. I love pepper sauce on steak but hardly had any on this as it seemed a shame to hide the taste of the actual steak. The garlic fries and spinach were good, I didn't like the mac n cheese but didn't think I would because of the truffle but my boyfriend didn't particularly enjoy it either.The meal was huge but not overwhelmingly so, which was nice. They then brought out complimentary desserts which was a plate with cheesecake, tiramisu, profiterole and I think there was one other as well. They were really good and a nice touch to have dessert on the house.It was an expensive meal ($150) before gratuity but the wine and, certainly, the steak made it worthwhile. This would have been 5 stars without a doubt if the service was quicker (it was over an hour between getting there and being served).",2,0,1,Sarah O.,"London, United Kingdom",101,170,142

3.0,10/23/2014,"Steak! Mmmmm.....Who doesn't love a big fat delicious juicy piece of meat?We were craving for MEAT and LOTS of it and since we were out of towners, we ventured on to try the best that New York had to offer. We arrived at this small, yet classy establishment. Why is it so dark in here? Although we were late, the long haired seater dude didn't mind at all and sat us down without any issues. Awesome fellow. This place is dark and everything is like........red. I guess it's to make you more bloodthirsty for MEAT and the sight of the color of blood brings out the animistic in you and it worked. I was aching to sink my teeth into some tender, succulent beefy flesh more than ever!We looked at the menu and our friendly waiter guy, forgot his name, gave us a run down on what size the portions are for the steak and the sides and etc. Really helpful chap was he. We placed our orders and ate some bread, chit chat and we got our first appetizers. Crab cakes, which was pretty good, nothing really to rave about. Them are crab cakes!  We ate some more bread and were eagerly waiting for our meal of the gods but alas, the wait time was just too long. We waited for 68 minutes, yes I timed it, for our main entrees to arrive. When we finally got our MEAT, they placed all the food at the wrong spots and I somehow got 2 orders which hell, I didn't mind but my buddy next to me with no food in front of him didn't look too happy. The staff corrected it by asking what we got and they placed the orders at the correct positions.Whatever. IT WAS ON! MEAT TIME!I just ordered a NY STRIP medium rare because I just wanted meat. First bite.......BURNT! The outside of the steak was burnt and all I tasted was burnt flesh. I was sad. The tears from my eyes soaked my pink napkin. All my urge and my will for steak had been gone with just one bite of this place's MEAT. Disappointed. I scraped off the burnt parts of the MEAT as I cried slowly. I cut into the other part of the steak and just ate it like normal. It wasn't anything special. It was just like any other steak now. I needed to get steak sauce and A1 sauce to drown out the burnt taste that was still in my mouth. Now I'm not a foody in any way and I'm super simple when it comes to food and I as long as the steak tasted like a steak, I didn't care but it was burnt. I cried as I paid for the bill because it was totally not worth it. I just wanted some steak that tasted like steak and this place actually made my steak craving shoot out of my soul with just one dark and burnt bite. The staff were friendly and were very attentive. The food was not really that good and it was just too long of a wait for mediocre burnt food. WHY DID YOU BURN MY STEAK? WHYYYY??? ALL I WANTED WAS SOME STEAK!! =(Update: The owner of the restaurant replied to my review. It shows that the owner actually cares about their customers. Things happen and I understand. I'm going to raise it to a 3 star just because of the owner comments and his care of his customers.",1,4,2,Will C.,"San Francisco, CA",25,73,0

After we were given complimentary pumpkin ravioli to try. I was a little skeptical bc I've never had them before but WOW!! The mushroom cream sauce was so savory and tied in the hint of pumpkin perfectly!! SO GOOD!!! For dinner I ordered the hanger steak and my bf the rib-eye. Juicy, tender, melt in your mouth steak. We couldn't decide on just one side so we opted for three, yes three for two people lol!! We love food what can we say!! A side of mashed potatoes, sautéed mushrooms, and truffle Mac and cheese.

We were greeted immediately by a really nice lady and was seated on the first floor. I went upstairs to use the bathroom, it looked much nicer.For appetizer, we ordered the Canadian Bacon... surprisingly good. It was a big piece, cooked perfectly, and the sauce was not too strong. Although without the sweet sauce, the meat can be a little too salty. Also for appetizer, we tried the crab cakes. Our waiter was nice enough to split the dish so both my bf and I had one big piece. It was full of crab meat and it was very flavorful. I've been to Maryland and I have to say, this is the best one I've had. For entree, we ordered the meal for two. It included pork, filet mignon, and sausages. The filet mignon was the perfect medium rare I've ever had - wish I can make steak like that. I didn't need steak sauce because it was already really tasty. The pork was a little too well-done for my tasting. But I enjoyed the dish overall.

When we got there there was a rose and a candle on the table, lighting was dark so it really looked like a romantic dinner for 2 girls. I was reading the bad reviews before I went, but I kinda don't understand the negative reviews. Lobster ravioli- Our waiter was nice enough to split our lobster ravioli in the kitchen and served it on 2 plates for me and my friend to share. The ravioli was filled with lobsters and cheese. I loved their cream sauce, it was amazing. Too bad we ate the steak first, by the time we ate the ravioli it was cold. But still good, I would go back and eat that as a starter. Steak- We ordered the medium well 24oz prime dry aged rib eye and it was great. The meat was juicy, not old, but still chewy. It wasn't as big as I thought, but it still filled us up. Crab cake- I don't really like crab cakes but that dish was surprisingly good. It was full of crab meat and it was flavorful. It didn't leave the nasty seafood aftertaste. Dessert- dessert was on the house :) it was the strawberry and blueberry with whipped cream, 2 cream puffs, tiramisu, and a chocolate cake. The berries and whipped cream was good, berries was fresh. I would go back and order the cream puff or even order some and take it to go, it's that good! Tiramisu was okay, but the chocolate cake was too sweet for me. Overall, I would DEFINITELY go back, and I will probably bring my boyfriend there to celebrate our 3 years anniversary soon. He's picky with food, but I'm positive that he will like it.

5.0,9/22/2014,"Oh my goodness, this place ranks as one of the best steakhouses that I've been to. From the ridiculously delicious meat to the perfectly tended service, Club A has balanced all aspects of a great restaurant into one classy yet modern steakhouse. There is a bar downstairs for those who would want to grab a drink while they wait for their table, although we didn't have to and got seated pretty quickly on a weekend night. We arrived early for our reservation but they were able to quickly accommodate us and didn't give us any trouble about it. Plus points for being versatile with reservation times!We ordered the porterhouse for 3, medium rare, in which some parts came out rare, but the quality was excellent so it didn't matter (I don't mind the variety of done-ness in my steak as long as its not well done). The creamed spinach had a hint of truffles, although not mentioned in the menu. The Mac and cheese had the earthy flavor of truffles which definitely made it especially palatable. The dessert menu usually has around 5 or so desserts, with the variety of cheesecake to chocolate delights. They also have multitudes of wine decanters decorated along the walls and seen with those who order bottles of wine. The restaurant has a mildly low lit mood, but not so much that you can't see what you're eating. Definitely worth visiting, and even worth a revisit.",2,0,1,Alex R.,"New York, NY",139,169,119

We had amazing experience with the following top three: Atmosphere excellent! Steaks wonderful! Service excellent!Atmosphere very American: soft lights but table well illuminated makes the your table warm saving your privacy. The tables are large and comfortable and there is much room between other tables. Steaks: women had mignon filet whose were very tasted but a little bit dry (they were medium cooked, rear were probably better), I and my friend shared a classic New York steak, (medium rear) which was very soft, delicious and juicy and a prime rib eye steak (medium rear) which was sooo soft and tender, while the taste was more intense than the New York steak (both delicious).As side dishes we tried spinach, broccoli and potato (all good).Service: attendants were always proactive and very helpful for suggesting the pest options and providing with information about the meat and wine or other. The way of the brought to our dishes all together for each person was impressive!Last but not least, we had many complementaries all along the dinner: just after placing the order (steaks and side dishes) they gave us ravioli with mushrooms, while after the meal we were offered with fresh fruit (very nice presentation) and desserts (tiramisu, cheesecake, profiteroles...). All of these were as complementary from the house... The only negative point, was the lack of good options of wines from Italy. They have good wines from US and France, but honestly there were not a good choice of Italian wines (to be improved).This long comment just to say: it is expensive, but you are in New York, if you want to enjoy a real New York dining experience about steaks, come here!",0,0,0,Michele C.,"Rome, Italy",1,1,0

Big plus- they take reservations.We arrived right before it became crowded.  This may be why we had the few issues we did.  Good wine list with nice bottles of all price ranges.  We ordered the oysters- they only had one kind but they were fresh.  Ordered dinner and here is where it broke down a little.  We had quite a wait fir it.  We were not in a hurry and they brought us a complimentary sample of their ravioli .  The steaks were very good (two bone in filet imignon , one regular filet and the lamb chops) but every one  was slightly overlooked . We ordered mushrooms (excellent) and herbed fries ( good) as sides.  After dinner they brought us dessert on the house.  I have to say the cream puffs were amazing .Price for 4 with two bottles of wine was $400 with tip- about what we expected.Will definitely return but either order my steak differently or talk to the waiter about this experience .",4,0,0,Deb T.,"South Portland, ME",4,24,1

5.0,9/18/2014,"My wife and I celebrated our engagement at Club A Steakhouse almost a year ago, and are still raving about the place. To begin with the service and experience were outstanding. We made reservations and told them the occasion to which they provided semi-personalized menus. Our waiter was attentive to our needs and knowledgeable about all the dishes/wines without being overly suggestive. Because we were celebrating our engagement, the restaurant owner provided us with complimentary glasses of champagne and a dessert plate which 4 different desserts (I can't recall all of them but they were all delicious). The Food: For dinner, we started off with the Canadian Bacon and a glass of wine (in terms of selection they have a nice variety but not the most extensive selection in the city). The Canadian Bacon is delicious, and is highly recommended for anyone who enjoys bacon or pork in  general. For the main meal we ordered the mixed grill for two along with the 5 Cheese Truffle Mac (Mac & Cheese), German Style Hash Browns, and Brussel Sprouts with bacon and parmesan. All of the meat was perfectly cooked and flavorful (Filet Mignon, Lamb chop Split, Italian Sausage, and Veal Steak). In particular I would recommend the Filet Mignon. As for the sides, the 5 Cheese Truffle Mac is probably one of the best if not the best Mac and Cheese type of dish we have ever had (and my wife is something of a cheese connoisseur). The German Hash Browns were also exceptional. The Brussel Sprouts were good as well (this coming from a person who doesn't enjoy eating them) but were not in the same class as the other two dishes.  The decor resembles an old-style lounge or club (which makes since given the name), which I personally enjoyed. That being said its not the most romantic setting if one is looking for a more traditional romantic dining experience. Overall the quality of the food and service are both outstanding. Club A Steakhouse provides a great experience which can only be outdone by some of the city's most renown (and expensive) restaurants.",0,0,0,David P.,"Manhattan, NY",0,10,0

I booked my table on yelp for 9pm. Once there, my party was greeted and seated in a very timely, manner. Inside, the decor is upscale, and I would recommend this place to someone trying to impress on a date. We ordered the, Porterhouse steak for 2, medium rare, with a trio of sides (mashed potatoes, creamed spinach, and mac n cheese. Let me tell you, the sides were all amazing. I did wish that the potatoes were salted and peppered. I noticed my friend at the table adding salt to them and I definitely know why. Now on to the steak. This was hands down one of the best if not the best steak I have ever eaten. I'm from Texas and we eat a lot of steak! The steak was cooked exactly like we asked (medium rare) and eating it  gave me some sort of euphoria! Furthermore, the owner came to our table and greeted us. After our meal was done, we asked for our check. Instead of the check coming out first, we get an amazing cheesecake and tiramisu on the house for desert. These desert items were  spectacular and furthered the euphoric feeling of me and my party. I swear it felt like they put drugs in their food. I would give this place a 10 if i could..

Almost done with our Ron Swanson NYC Steakhouse tour for the year, but this was definitely a great experience.When we entered, we were greeted by multiple hostesses, which was surprising, but very much welcomed. The inside of the restaurant was very dimly lit and it felt pretty intimate. Definitely appropriate for date night, which isn't always typical for a steakhouse.Our waiter was very professional and attentive, and I felt bad because he went through a lot of trouble listing off recommendations and the specials, when I already went into the meal knowing full well what we were going to order. ""Yeah, those specials and recommendations you had to memorize? We're going to have none of that."" Nonetheless, our waiter was still very hospitable, and kept the food and drinks coming.Started off with the usual Lagavulin neat, and obviously a slice each of the Canadian bacon. Always a good, nay, great choice. We got the double eagle strip, the ribeye, and the filet mignon, to mix it up a bit. We also ordered the truffle mac, creamed spinach, and the wild mushrooms. Everything was absolutely delicious, my favorite being the ribeye and the wild mushrooms. The filet mignon was a bit too charred for our tastes but it was still very tender. However, the ribeye was very flavorful and not too fatty, and the strip was just a good piece of meat. The roasted mushrooms had a great earthy taste and I liked that they were all various types of mushrooms.After we had finished our steaks, the waiter came out with tiramisu, profiteroles, and cheesecake, all on the house. All three were delicious and rounded out the meal perfectly. We all ordered some more Lagavulin, and you just can't beat a night like that.Overall, an awesome experience, and definitely a steakhouse I'd recommend to others.

It was absolutely gorgeous. The table they reserved us had us behind this beautifully lit tree and oh ... just romantic. They wished us a happy anniversary, was very attentive to us the entire time, and the food was simply fantastic. My husband had a mouth orgasm with his 22 day aged steak or whatever it was. Then they served us a complimentary anniversary dessert dish. Everything was delicious. I was really afraid this was going to be some gimmicky place where the ambiance was great but the food subpar. Nope! Lived up to its expectations. Just be prepared to spend a bit if you eat here.Only downside was the picture part where they used their own camera with this bright flash. Ahha .. I looked terrible. I think the lady who too it silently agreed, pfffft! But it's okay, flash sucks sometimes when its directly in your face. I say this as a photographer who would have preferred to just use the lighting already in the room.

There seemed to be families, couples, tourists, and everything in between. It's not typically a restaurant I would go to, but I was happy to experience it.The service here is impeccable, perhaps the best I've experienced in NYC. Attentive waitstaff, multiple waiters checking on you and filling your water at all times. We even received a complimentary dessert platter, along with the tables around us, so that was a really nice gesture.As for the food...all solid, except for the creamed spinach which I found too salty. Like I mentioned before, I don't eat a lot of red meat and actually feel a little nauseous when I do. But I went with their filet mignon, cooked medium-rare, and immediately knew that it was a good, juicy, flavorful steak. I could only eat a little bit, but I still know a good steak when I taste one. We also ordered the truffle mac & cheese and creamed spinach as sides. The mac & cheese was nice but I wasn't a big fan of the creamed spinach.

3.0,8/1/2014,"Came here a while ago so this review is a little dated, but nevertheless, the steak was just ok for me. I asked for it medium and described what I was my interpretation of a medium cooked steak and they just ""yeah'd"" me in response saying they knew what to do and would take care of it. When I got my steak, it was bloody and rare, clearly no regard for what I had asked for. Hence the 3 stars, plenty of great places in the city that will cook the steak the way you actually want it, so I can't really find any reason to come back here.",0,0,0,Brandon M.,"Raleigh, NC",23,132,2
5.0,8/1/2014,"I took a couple colleagues, who are local New Yorkers, to this restaurant. They had never heard of the place.  Plus considering that our office is only a few blocks away, they were quite skeptical of how good the food was going to be.We made a reservation in advance, and when we arrived we were seated promptly.  The hostess was polite and dressed nicely.  We sat in the corner of the room.  Next to the table was a glass indented bookshelf where vintage bottles of red wine were stored.  The room had a modern yet old school steakhouse feel.  Newer black and white photos of friends and patrons in frames ran across the walls.  The ceiling had well placed indirect line, which gave the place a modern flare.  We got a bottle of the Roth Cabernet S., which was outstanding for the price.  All 3 of us got a Caesar salad, which was served perfectly (just the right amount of dressing and croutons, lettuce was crisp without the bitter pieces, and they served it with anchovies, classic!).  For the main course we went our separate ways.  I had a filet, which was cooked perfectly (medium rare, well charred on the outside).  The chef brought us a free desert assortment, which was ridiculously good.  I could go on and on.  Great place.  Perfect for afterwork drinks and/or dinner!",1,0,0,Russell D.,"Libertyville, IL",1,26,2

The asparagus is an amazing side and plenty for 2 people to split. The meal was finished with a complimentary dessert sampler!

We ordered oysters as an appetizer then Prime Dry Aged Porterhouse Steak for 3 and a Prime Dry Aged Double Eagle Strip Bone-in to share. Also got mac and cheese, creamed spinach, and mushrooms for sides. The server suggested the Canadian Bacon to try and it was pretty good but a bit too salty for my taste. They also gave us each a piece of Lobster Ravioli on the house which was delicious! If this wasn't a steakhouse (and if I didn't love steak so much), I probably would've ordered that.  Steak was delicious - we ordered rare and it was perfect. I loved the mac and cheese. Overall, great meal and the service was fantastic. At the end of the meal, they gave us complimentary dessert with ""Happy Birthday"" written on the side of the plate.

4.0,7/10/2014,"We came here again during last year's Restaurant Week. While the food was still fantastic, the service was a little disappointing. We were seated right by the host stand, by the railing before entrance into the main dining area. There were only two small tables where we were seated, so it felt like we were isolated from everyone else. Due to the location and possibly because it's Restaurant Week, we felt like we were being jostled by people passing through. At one point, a waiter between the two tables had his back turned to us, and his pants almost caught fire from our candle when he bent over to pour water for the other table!We ordered appetizers and entrees very similar to our first visit. While still very enjoyable, it wasn't an out-of-this-world experience like last time; we're not sure if it's the food itself or the different atmosphere. The personal attention from last time definitely wasn't there.I would rate this experience with 3 stars; since last time was 5 stars, it's averaged out to 4 stars.

I raved about their food and service only to left embarrassed and providing excuses for the negative experience. There is an obvious bias by the staff towards guests with Groupon deals. If you do not wish to treat everyone equally, then do not partake in the coupon at all.It started off ok. The server immediately assumed that because we had a Groupon that we were financially challenged and that set the tone for the evening. You should never assume anything. Trust me. The initial red flag was when we finally were ready to order food, AfTER the server told us the soup special and opened / poured our wine, were we told that the Veal on the prix fix was not available. We ordered anyways. We were brought (dry/stale) bread and waited for our appetizers. Meanwhile another table of three was seated beside us. The appetizers (calamari & soup) was good. Tasty soup. Fresh calamari.We finished that and waited for our main courses (filet mignon and hanger steak). Meanwhile the table beside us was served veal. ????Nice. I guess your chef managed to find some after all. After about another thirty minutes our main course finally arrived. The sides were wrong and the food was cold. The steaks were tasty but cold. We had to wait without any sides for about another 15 minutes. Ridiculous. That was unacceptable and pathetic. Dessert was awful. Pastry puffs tasted previously frozen and bland.I was not impressed with the poor dishonest slow service and sub par food quality.

The mac and cheese was delicious some of the best Ive ever had. My one and only complaint and the reason this is 4 stars is because the fries were gross. For $9 the fries should be better than diner quality... we sent them back but it didn't help. The manager came over and apologized and also gave us a complimentary desert platter.

This is what I pictured an authentic New York steakhouse to be.,0,0,0,Chris M.,"Cypress, TX",11,10,4
5.0,6/11/2014,"I don't write reviews often, but a client took me here last night and the service was impeccable. When the steaks were brought out we were asked to cut into them to see if they were cooked to our liking. My filet was a nice medium with a well cooked outside, fine by me. My coworker had ordered the ribeye medium that came out a solid medium well. Us not being ones to complain hesitated when asked, but said it looked more to to the well side and they kindly offered to make us another which we politely declined. The owner and wait staff comped the steak and even brought a complimentary bottle of wine (our 4th I believe) and a dessert platter. Oh I almost forgot, the cocktail that I ordered was not available and they actually went to the local store to get the ingredients to make it since they didn't carry one of the products (which my company makes). Amazing. At the end of the meal, quite late, the owner also offered us a night cap which at this point none of us needed.",2,0,0,Cameron K.,"Hermosa Beach, Los Angeles, CA",0,4,0

Minetta Tavern and Wolfgang both had more flavor, but the service here was the best. The server is friendly and attentive but doesn't rush you, and they gave us a delicious mushroom ravioli and THREE pieces of dessert on the house. It wasn't even a special occasion or anything, but turned out to be my dad's favorite part of the meal. I think most of the tables probably got something free, but still, it's very nice of them.

All the side dishes were excellent, and the wine selection was very good, with some reasonably priced, yet high quality selections on their list to choose from. After our meal, we were treated to a complimentary dessert, and the owner came and chatted with us and even bought a nightcap for the two of us. I would recommend this as a ""special occasion"" type of place any day of the week.

5.0,5/21/2014,"My boyfriend and I were celebrating our anniversary and wanted a fantastic dinner.  I flicked through my Yelp app and Club A caught my eye - I figured with a simple menu of steak and seafood and a stellar rating from over a thousand reviews, there's no way we could go wrong.So, I went in thinking it was going to be great, but it much more than great.  We had an amazing night to celebrate a milestone in our lives and Club A was a huge part of it. First Impression: The ambience was fantastic - upscale, warm, elegant, inviting. The family pictures were a welcome and lovely touch. We were seated upstairs in the corner next to the windows - table set impeccably with a candle and a rose. The plush ceiling was really cool too. We had reservations earlier in the evening so it wasn't dark yet, but I imagine later in the night it gets even more cozy and romantic.Food/Drinks: A+. Ordered Chimays and gin & tonics while we deliberated over the menu. I was stuck in the typical lobster or steak debate so we opted for the lobster cocktail for the appetizer so I could order the steak without missing out. Lobster was perfect - DB is not a seafood person but he was converted. Perfectly cooked and seasoned, and the sauces were delicious. For dinner, I got the hanger steak, DB got the veal osso bucco, and we shared sauteed spinach and the whipped potato puree sides. Fantastic. Again, everything was perfectly cooked, and the portions were big - I took the steak home, and even though DB almost never finishes a restaurant meal, he took every last bite of the veal. I think we would have ordered another hanger steak had we had room. Spinach was just what you'd expect of spinach - healthy, vegetably, delicious - and the whipped potato puree was a delicious and creamy take on traditional mash. So good. Service: Beyond wonderful. We got there a bit early and Bruno seated us a few minutes before our reservation. Our server was personable and friendly and checked in often to see if the food was to our liking or if we needed anything - and once to deliver a plate of mushroom ravioli for us to try (heavenly. Light, delicious, creamy). Also, after we asked to look at the dessert menu, they brought out a delicious dessert dish on the house with ""happy anniversary"" written in chocolate syrup on the plate (swoooon). Just as I started happy crying, as I am wont to do, they brought out a camera and said they were snapping and a picture for us to remember the night by. WHAT. Cue awkward picture of my handsome, smiling boyfriend, me and my round face swollen with tears, and a bangin' dessert plate. Bruno brought over the picture and a thank you note and well wishes.Amazing place, amazing food, amazing people. We had such a wonderful night and have already recommended it to family and friends.

5.0,5/21/2014,"Great experience. NY Strip was excellent, not over-seasoned and very high quality. Tried the tomato and onion salad which was as expected, onion rings which were very good, hash browns which were also good (although the include green peppers which I don't love) and brussel sprouts which I did not love (not because of quality, just because the preparation was not to my taste). We were there for an occasion and they brought out some dessert on the house, which was excellent (especially the carrot cake). Service was exemplary and attentive without hovering, and the owner greeted us and thanked us on the way out. I'm a frequent steakhouse eater, and this one is now on my short list.

(Also could be because we were hungry) The escargots, which were not bad but after tasting escargots in Paris, I feel nothing here will ever measure up. I keep ordering it at different restaurants in hopes of capturing the same feeling I got in Paris but so far I have not found it.I enjoyed the rib eye steak that we had for our meal. It was big enough for the two of us and was very juicy. The Club A sauce was good, but nothing special. It tasted like cocktail sauce with a little bit of bbq sauce. We also ordered the creamed spinach, which is on the salty side and definitely small for the $10 price tag. My boyfriend and I both enjoyed the mushroom ravioli (on the house).

This time, Club A fared much better!They seemed to have changed the menu to become more Luger-esque, and still remains to be the best steakhouse in terms of atmosphere. I feel that their porterhouse steak was still slightly underseasoned, and did not have the dry-aged taste to it, but much much better than the steak I had last time. Felt that the best dish of the night was the escargot, pretty surprising for a steakhouse. Having said that, the environment is definitely what got Club A four stars in my book -- Wolfgang's, Benjamin's, Ben and Jack's, Capital Grille and Luger do not have that romantic vibe to them.

For some reason, I'm always impressed when you show up early but are able to be seated.The atmosphere of this place is wonderful. The decor and lighting are perfect for a steakhouse. Once we were seated, we were able to get our wine and food order in very quickly. My girlfriend had the filet mignon while I went for the double eagle strip. Both were impeccably cooked and had excellent flavor. Mine was a little more lean than I typically like, but that's on me for ordering it. The sides were a mixed bag, however. We went for their three sides for $24 deal and decided on the hash brown, truffle mac and cheese, and the asparagus. The hash brown was alright, although I did have a slight regret that we didn't go for mash or fries. The mac and cheese and asparagus were both good, but they both had a similar issue...they were way too garlicky. I like garlic to an extent, but there's a definite limit. When I'm pulling big chunks of it out of my teeth, that goes a bit over the line. After we were finished, we were given a selection of complimentary desserts, all of which were wonderful.

5.0,5/2/2014,"Found this place with a simple Yelp search. My wife and I were celebrating our 15th Anniversary and wanted a very special experience. Boy did we find it here. We made a reservation for 5PM and it turned out to be a great idea as the place was not busy at all yet and we had the upstairs window area all to ourselves. The huge picture windows over looking the street added to the ambience as did the Tony Bennett, Frank Sinatra and Dean Martin playing in the background. The décor is ""gaudy"" but in a very good way. I ordered a Captain Morgan and Coke and it came out in a pint glass, way bigger than the drink I had just paid more for down the street a little while before.For an appetizer we ordered the Fried Calamari. It was perfectly cooked and deliciously seasoned. We ate every bite of it. The marinara was just a bit spicy, but again, in a good way.After a full day of eating our way around Manhattan neither one of us were all that hungry so we asked the waiter if we could split a steak and he happily agreed. So we ordered the 24 Oz Rib Eye (Bone-In) and the Truffle Mac & Cheese.While we waited, the owner, Bruno, came to the table to make sure everything was good. He was so friendly and gracious.The waiter brought out a mushroom ravioli appetizer for both of us on the house. My wife missed out big time as she is allergic to mushrooms so I ate her mushroom ravioli and was happy to do it. I didn't come up for air until they were both gone and the plates practically licked clean, it was incredible.The main course came out and the one bad thing I can say about the whole experience was that it was a just little undercooked for my taste. I had ordered medium-rare, but it came out more towards the rare side. But it was still AMAZING. Along with the fantastic (heavenly) Mac & Cheese, they also brought us out (on the house, again...) 2 other sides, the mashed potatoes (which were the best I think I've ever had...) and the creamed spinach, which tasted a lot like a spinach and artichoke dip to me (not a big spinach fan, but it was good).The steak had a crust on it that was so delicious you didn't want to stop eating it. It came out with the house steak sauce which tasted a lot like ketchup with a kick (almost like cocktail sauce actually).After all of that we were SO full and not wanting to eat anything else, but soon arrived at the table a dessert plate (again, on the house) decorated with ""Happy 15th Anniversary"" and including several different dessert ""tastings."" It had a chocolate ""bon-bon"" type of thing with ice-cream, a slice of tiramisu, and two of the most incredible cream puffs I've ever had.After downing the dessert plate, needless to say we could barely breathe when we left.The price for all of this was VERY reasonable considering what we got for our money.All through the meal Bruno kept coming back to the table and checking on us and just making sure everything was perfect, which it was indeed.I cannot recommend this place enough.

I informed him it was over cook and was cooked to about medium well (barley any pink and the center was warm). He argued with me for a while saying that it was ""aged which makes it look different"". Finally he left the table and asked the manager if he could take the steak back. After he brought the steak back out he apologized saying it was over cooked and most of the customer's do not know nearly as much about steaks as them. In all every other table had plastic cows displaying the order temperatures but my table which makes me feel that it was the waiters mistake and he was trying to cover it up.

For the appetizers, we got calamari which was just the perfect amount of chewy. For the entree, we got the porterhouse for 2 and 3 sides of garlic fries, potato purée and Mac and cheese. Before I go on, do not get this much food unless you both have bottomless pits for stomachs. It was just way too much food. The steak was just HEAVENLY and the way it melted in my mouth was just incredible. We got it medium rare so it was just perfect.The sides weren't all that special, the only thing that stood out were the 5 cheese Mac and cheese with truffle oil, which was just delicious.Lastly, as it was our anniversary, the waiter graciously presented us with complimentary dessert. It was quite delicious, and we were very happy at this gesture.All in all, this is a place worth checking out. Not only do the waiters take care of you, but the steak here is outstanding as well!",1,0,1,Tashnuva E.,"Queens, Queens, NY",273,551,126

Luckily I had someone to share it with. Would of been 5 stars if there was a surf and turf combo on the menu, or even the option to add a lobster tail. I did ask our waiter but said only full lobsters were available.

3.0,4/22/2014,"Me and my partner came here during the Easter weekend where all the other well rated restaurants in NYC were booked. We decided to pick this restaurant because it was the only well-rated restaurant in yelp that has seats available for dinner. The place itself was very romantic. It's def a place where you can bring your date along. With the variety of options from the meat category, I did not know what to order. I asked the waiter what is the most popular entree among all, and he recommended the mixed grill for two. So me and my partner decided to share the mixed grill for two together. We both expected a small portion of different steaks in the mixed grill for two, however we were disappointed to see that half of the plate was hot Italian sausages. We asked for the meat to be cooked in medium rare, but I do feel like it's a little overcooked. I rated a 3-star only because of the food that we were recommended, but the overall atmosphere and service was great.

Number 1 on the list was Club A, with a wealth of 5 star reviews. We arrived without a reservation, and were seated within minutes, in an already packed restaurant with a gorgeous ambiance. A high-chair was provided for the baby, and moments later, a gentleman (who later turned out to be the owner) offered a stroller, as it would be more comfortable for the baby to sleep. We ordered a couple appetizers to share. Soon we were treated to some incredible cuisine. The crab cakes are to die for. This was followed by a very impressive complimentary course of ravioli. By this time we were stunned. We expected good, but this experience so far had been outstanding. Our entreés arrived shortly after, in the form or meticulously prepared steaks and pork chops. The cuts were magnificent, with just a little char, that was nothing short of magical. The sides didn't fall short either.

We came in 10 min before our reservation and were seated immediately. The ambience was laid back and there's an old NY feel to it. We started of with calamari as appetizer and it was the best calamari we ever had. My wife and I have always ordered calamari in different restaurants to compare and this by far tops it off.  For the main course, we ordered the porterhouse steak for 2 medium well (per my wife's preference) with whipped potato, creamed spinach and pan roasted mushrooms for the sides. The steak was cooked perfectly and tasty even for a medium rare kinda guy like me. The creamed spinach and pan roasted mushroom were amazing! It tasted like there were steak drippings on them which was good. We requested the bernaise sauce, which was one of the tip from one yelper and it brought it to another level. The service was outstanding. When I called in for reservation, they asked if there was any special occasion and I told them it was our 2nd anniversary. The owner Bruno came to our table and greeted us, they took a picture of me and my wife and gave us a printed copy attached to a card. I've never experienced service like this!

The pepper sauce wasn't peppery at all and the mushroom sauce was     also bland. Most steak restaurants back home (Australia) also offer a rang of mustards and I really missed having a good spicy English mustard on hand.

4.0,3/15/2014,"Typical pretty good steakhouse, but honestly not sure why you would venture out of your way to this pretty unideal location when there are better more convenient steakhouses in the city unless you happen to live / work in the UES / Midtown East area. Save the hassle and just go to Wolfgang's! Powerhouse- why else go to a steakhouse. They did it well as expected and the sauce is great too. I must say the complimentary mushroom ravioli and desert are a nice touch. On the desert front though if they are going to do it they might as well give you a choice on the desert depending on their availability or give everyone the same desert. I saw some one with cheesecake and got excited because its not like I would normally order desert but if they are giving me something complimentary I would like to try it. Instead we got three desserts- chocolate cake, cream puff and tiramisu- three desserts that I have absolutely no interest in. Then the table next to us got ice cream! I would have gone for the cheesecake or ice cream over the others.  On the sides front... Not sure what is with all the bad reviews on the creamed spinach.  It was the best side we got!  German style hash brown were really pretty bad (Stick to Peter Lugar/ Wolfgang's for this one) and I could cook better brussel sprouts than we got. On the canadian bacon appetizer- if you like extra fatty and salty this is a must have. Service was great and if you get a bottle of wine they serve it in an awesome wine decanter!

3.0,3/13/2014,"Steak: 4 stars, Sides: 2 stars, Service: 3 starsThe steak was very good. Our party of three had the filet, rib eye and NY strip. The rib eye was probably the best, but they were all very good and cooked perfectly to order.The side dishes, on the other hand, were pretty bland. And the portions were tiny for the price (about 3 bites each for $10-$12 per side dish). The truffle mac 'n cheese tasted like Kraft mac (the cheap kind, not the premium) with a sprinkle of truffle oil and some cheddar singles half-melted on top. The cream spinach was decent but had way too much garlic. The parmesan and bacon brussel sprouts were extremely sweet and candy like.The service was ok. They just weren't knowledgeable enough about the wine. If you're spending decent money for a bottle of wine the servers should be trained well enough to compare, contrast and, at the very least, explain the flavors of the wine. You need to offer more than ""it's smooth and full."" Or you should have a sommelier who can step in and provide support. At least the waiter didn't try to BS his way through an explanation. After several questions he flat out said he didn't know the wines well enough to provide sufficient descriptions/answers. I give him credit for his honesty.One last point about the ""complimentary"" mushroom ravioli and dessert plate: it's not complimentary when they overcharge for the steak and side dishes. The food is generally priced about 10% higher vs comparable steak houses. You end up paying for the appetizer and dessert through the other dishes.There are plenty of better steakhouses in NY.",2,1,1,Peter R.,"Manhattan, NY",29,155,2

I shared a porterhouse with my friend and it was perfectly seasoned and cooked. I had the Brussels sprouts which were the best I've ever tasted.

Although we could not get a web-based reservation for Sat. night at 7:30, the gentleman who took my call at about 12 noon was warm and accommodating. Our coats were checked and we were seated immediately upon our arrival and only a couple of table were available aside from the one at which we were seated. Service was prompt and courteous, the martini was pretty massive. We were a party of 4 and although at least a couple of us are adventurous eaters, the 4 of us shared 2 16oz filet mignons and 2 caesar salads. The salads were excellent. The steaks took a while to appear and our waiter explained that the medium cook order took a bit longer than the medium rare. The steaks appeared and the med. rare steak was slightly overcooked but the medium one was perfect. I felt that the texture of the steak should have been more tender but they were reasonable tender and VERY flavorful. We enjoyed creamed spinach, mushrooms, and asparagus as side dishes and all were excellent. Much to our surprise, 4 chilled dishes appeared after our meal and a plate with 3 deserts landed on the table, compliments of the house. Cheesecake, cream puffs, and tiramisu, all of which were very good.Like most NYC steakhouses, the ambient noise waxed and waned between moderate and quite loud. There was live music (bass and keyboard) which also varied in volume. The table was a bit small to accommodate all of our food but we've certainly had more cramped quarters in other lesser establishments. Overall, we certainly recommend this restaurant and believe it is in line with most other high end steakhouses in NYC.

And mind you, it was my first time trying out restaurant week.I remember arriving on time for my reservation.  However, I ended up staying past closing time that day even!  Upon seating, we were on the very top floor and the room was filled with Asians.  Being Asian myself, I felt like it was a bit intimidating to sit in a whole room of Asians, all on the same floor, and all there for restaurant week.My party ordered our dishes but it took over an hour before  something arrived.  I'm sure even the waiters knew it took a while for our food to come because even without complaining, they came over to apologize.  We sat there for over three hours during our whole entire Club A experience.  Yes, they tried to accommodate us by giving us this side dish that consisted of mushrooms and cheese--although the exact name, I have forgotten.  Which was inconsiderate on their part because it was a very heavy dish.  By the time our food came, the dish settled in and we were already not feeling an appetite. All my company wanted to do was  leave.  However, regardless of whether we eat it or not, we still had to pay for everything. Therefore, we all took a few bites out of our food.  It was nothing outstanding in my opinion.  By the time we were nibbling on our entrees and desserts, the restaurant was closed by then and it didn't make us feel welcomed anymore.  They didn't rush us, yes...which is totally reasonable considering we sat there since 6 or 7 (I forgot the reservation time, but this is the time frame I ALWAYS reserve seatings at a restaurant for).  HOWEVER, all the waiters were surrounding our one table that was left on the top floor, patiently waiting to collect our plates and waiting for us to leave so that they can leave work.  As if that wasn't enough, besides the waiters that were already stationed on the top floor that night, an additional waiter came up to monitor us as well.I can't come to explain or describe what a bad experience I've had at this restaurant.  Maybe others have had a better restaurant week experience, and maybe others have had it better not on restaurant week.  But as an individual, for me, I was not impressed at all. My company didn't enjoy the night either, and everything was just a huge turnoff in general.",2,0,0,Annie M.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,5,0

I have to crack it on my own. I had Filet Mignon, the steak was huge and fine cut, served with spinach cheese cream sauce on side, it had good flavor on it. and my friend ordered the fish special for the night, the chef gave us a show in front of us how to take the bone out of the fish then cut it into small pieces, fire the plate and make it hot. it was delicious.

I've been craving a perfect steak for 3 years (sad, sad, I know) and the prime aged porterhouse for 2 hit the mark! Our conversation came to a complete stop as we savored each amazing bite. We chose the Club A steak sauce, which is served on the side, but the steak didn't need it. It had so much flavor on it's own.We also had oysters, sauteed spinach, truffle mac and cheese, and Brussels sprouts with bacon.

3.0,2/21/2014,"Came here for Valentine's Day with the husband and spend a night without our 10-month old, and let's just say that I'm slightly disappointment with the food and service at this place and here's why: 1) I made the reservation at this place and nobody mentioned to me that there will be a  special Valentine's Day menu. Coming in here and finding that piece of paper with a set course was a surprise and most importantly, I came here to try their aged porterhouse and it was not even an available option on the menu. Strike One2) Then, I asked the waiter about the dessert that was called (If I remembered correctly) the valentine trio or something like that. And the waiter gave me a quite condescending look, pointed to the menu and said the price is listed, $115 pp. I then repeated myself to him and said I'm asking about the dessert, not the price. Yah, I may have looked really tired from not sleeping due to a teething baby at home, but if I'm here, then obviously I can pocket the expenses. Not to mention that throughout my meal, I had to wait like 5 minutes each time before somebody sees me to fill my empty glass. Not the type of service I expect from a place with a superb raing here on yelp. Strike Two3)  I ordered the prime strip, medium rare. It was prepared exactly how I wanted towards the center of the meat, but not the whole piece. Not acceptable for a steakhouse and for charging $115pp. I guess we just end up paying for the live music and all the valentine's day decor, which consisted of heart shaped balloons and red rose on each table. Although I have to say that their truffle oil creamed spinach was amazing. Hats off, best cream spinach I've had, that I have to give it to them. Still, as for the steak, Strike OutOverall, I was not content with the food and especially the service here. Maybe my waiter was mad that he had to serve on Valentine's Day and probably had a fight with his girlfriend, but that ain't my problem. I'm not sure I'll be coming back here. And o yah, one last point to the management staff who is reading this review. Please do not reply and give me a ""sorry about your experience and I will sure to bring it up on our next staff meeting"" kind of crap.

4.0,2/21/2014,"Service at this place was amazing!  The appetizers, sizzling bacon and lobster cocktail were soooo good.  The cuts of meat were right up there, cooked perfect.  We had the Strip and the Filet (not bone in).  The only thing that i didn't like was the creamed spinach and the béarnaise sauce.  The creamed spinach had truffle oil in it, which was weird tasting and the béarnaise sauce was super salty and coagulated fast when it cooled which made it look cheap.  When we complained about the sauce the manager comped us on an awesome desert platter.  It was a super meal, if the béarnaise was good it would have been an over the top experience.  Did I mention their staff was simply amazing!!",0,0,0,Ryan D.,"Ringwood, NJ",14,28,5

Only one of us received the filet and the others all were served a New York Strip. On top of that they were supposed to be Medium Rare and all were severely over charred and cooked to a medium. We all left almost all of our steaks behind. We were told if we wanted to get what we ordered it would really take awhile to fix the problem.

5.0,2/17/2014,"Club A Steakhouse is a romantic take on the American Steakhouse mastered by the likes of Peter Luger's and Wolfgang's with a more extensive menu, including more options for steak and sides. Set in a cozy corner of the upper east side, this double level steakhouse is here to impress.  Throughout your dinner there is live music that is very peaceful and not overwhelming.  I also recommended requesting a second floor window seat, over looking the lit tree outside.  The food: We were started with a complimentary appetizer, which was very nice of them considering that we didn't really do anything to warrant it.  It was a mushroom ravioli and it was very tasty. For the main meal, we ordered the porterhouse for 2 ($47 PP), which was very good.  I requested the steak to be cooked medium, but it was cooked medium-rare, which left one or two pieces being slightly chewier than I like, but nothing to take away from the meal. If I could make one recommendation to ownership it would be that they set the porterhouse dish down on an angle, so the juices puddle at the bottom and you can add them to your steak.  The way they serve it causes the valuable juices to just dry to the bottom of the dish, essentially wasting them. For our sides (3 for $24) we chose the german potatoes, the mac n cheese, and the broccoli.  The german potatoes were perfect and extremely good.  The mac n cheese was also very cheesy and gooey, just how i like it.  On the other hand, the broccoli was sub-par.  I don't know how to explain it, but it just wasn't good so I would suggest substituting that for the mashed potato puree or a different vegetable. The next thing we noticed is that everyone also receives a complimentary dessert.  There is no dessert menu, the waiter simply brings you out a dessert sampler that does vary by table.  Our sampler included two cream puffs (which were OK, a little soggy, which means they had been sitting there a while), a slice of apple crump pie, which I really enjoyed, and a slice of Tiramisu, which i didn't try because I am not a fan.  We noticed that another table received a alive of cheesecake instead of the apple crumb.  We were extremely full after the main meal that we wouldn't have even ordered dessert if we had the option, but it was a really nice touch.  Overall, Club A is a five star romantic date night restaurant.  Dress classy and have a great time!",2,1,1,Mike D.,"Whitestone, Queens, NY",58,152,459

Food: 5/5 We started out with the lobster cocktail, it was really good. Our server brought out mushroom ravioli on the house, it was also awesome. We got the mixed grill for two as our main course (lamb chop was best of these if you have to pick one.) Super filling and everything was delicious. We also got the three sides for $24 - did onion rings, garlic herb fries and truffle mac (best mac & cheese ever) Finished off with a dessert plate that had 3-4 things on it (also on the house.) We left completely stuffed. Drinks were about what you'd expect to pay in Manhattan - but they're strong as hell. You definitely get what you pay for here.Service: 5/5 Waiter was super attentive without being intrusive. Lots of stuff comped, absolutely zero sense they were trying to turn tables over quickly. The owner, Bruno, actually came around and introduced himself. A guy at a table behind us was so excited about this place that he offered his house & boat in Punta Cana to Bruno for a vacation. Bruno also gave us drinks to end the night. Again, these were strong as hell.Atmosphere: 5/5 There was someone playing piano and singing downstairs - and it wasn't obnoxious at all. Definitely helped created a romantic vibe. Decor was great, tables aren't packed too close together. Would definitely recommend for a date.Overall, I  would 100% recommend this place.

Overall, very attentive, courteous staff who went out of their way to make sure we had a great experience. Food: Meal started with a fantastic classic caesar salad. Authentic-you could really taste the anchovies in the dressing. We also got an excellent portobello raviolo that was compliments of the house! More of this to come. I debated between the filet mignon and the porterhouse for 2. Decided on the porterhouse, which ended up being a smart choice (though you won't go wrong choosing the filet). To my pleasant surprise, the porterhouse for 2 included a perfectly cooked filet mignon cut, along with a juicy sirloin portion. Both sides of the t-bone were charred to perfection and cooked in their own juices to keep the meat tender and flavorful. It was more than enough for the two of us. We shared a side of 5 cheese truffle mac. As good as it sounds. To top it all off, they brought us a complimentary dessert sampler of fresh fruit w/homemade whipped cream, creme puffs in chocolate creme sauce, tiramisu, and a cinnamon cheese cake that literally melts in your mouth.

And, the food here is so-so. We ordered the porterhouse for two along with  mashed potato puree, spinach sauteed with garlic, and truffle mac and cheese. The mashed potatoes were the best thing on the plate. Creamy, buttery, and delicious.   The spinach was under seasoned and bland. It could've used more salt and garlic. The truffle flavored overwhelmed the mac & cheese (though I temper this by saying I'm not a huge fan of truffle). Lastly, and most disappointingly, the steak was rubbery and a bit bland. Biting into the porterhouse, I didn't get that salty char on the outside and moist and buttery inside that I was craving. It left something to be desired.That said, the ambiance, with all the candle light and deep colors, makes for a romantic evening. And, the service was impeccable.",1,0,0,Jazmine S.,"Berkeley, CA",3,98,21

5.0,1/27/2014,"I took my wife here for her birthday last week Tuesday and it was AMAZING!! The waiters are by far the best I've ever had, and the food was great! I asked the waiter what he would suggest for a steak, and he recommended the porterhouse. We could not have been happier with this pick! We were on vacation in New York for her birthday so I looked to Yelp to help us find a great steakhouse, and this was the one we decided on, and it did not disappoint! As other Yelpers have said before, the owner was there that night greeting customers, which for a slow Tuesday night(due to the fact it snowed ALL DAY) was something I found to be cool and it showed he really cares about his business! For our first trip to New York I couldn't have asked for a better experience or a better place to spend her special occasion. Due to the snow, traffic was a nightmare, so we walked about 1.5 miles to the restaurant that evening, and after the experience we had there I would do it again in a heartbeat! The wine and the food were both epic... And to cap off what was a great dinner, one of our waiters brought out a complimentary plate of desserts for us, not just one dessert, but three different types of dessert! And I hadn't even mentioned we were there celebrating her birthday. We've eaten at a lot of different places, but this was by far overall one of the best experiences we've had at a restaurant yet, and I just wouldn't feel right not taking the time to let them know just how special they made the experience for us. When we visit New York again I will not hesitate coming back to this place to dine again! 5 stars all the way!",0,0,0,Rory B.,"North Park, San Diego, CA",0,5,4
4.0,1/27/2014,"Let me clarify first, I'm not a regular steak dinner type of person. Usually we'd go to steakhouse every 6 months or so when we both crave something meaty. But when we do go to a steakhouse, we need the meat to be very high quality, and everything comes along with it to be delicious. In other words, we are picky steak eaters. Before moving to New York, we lived in Chicago for a few years and visited several very good steakhouses in Chicago. We loved every single one of them. After dinner at Club A Steakhouse, I've concluded that steakhouses in Midwest are just better than the ones in New York. Now that's not to say it's not good, but it's just not GREAT. Club A has a very cozy and reddish looking interior, I personally like it because it looks intimate and romantic. Upon seated, our waiter promptly brought us menu, water, and bread. Comparison #1 - steakhouse bread in Chicago (in every restaurant we went to) were waaaayyyy better than the bread we got; the variety was limited, I personally think the bread was dry and too crusty. We got a bottle of wine, tuna tartare, the porterhouse for 2, and three sides (mushroom, Brussels sprouts, and fries). Tuna tartare was pretty good, you can tell it's fresh. The presentation of the porterhouse steak was impressive. They cut it up in front of you and put the slices in your plate so you don't have to do the work. I personally prefer NOT to cut up the entire steak while eating. When you do that, it's inevitable some of the juice would get lost too early. Now with that said, the steak was delicious and perfectly cooked. I liked the filet way better than the new york strip because it's just more tender (for those that might be confused, porterhouse is a t-bone, the bone separates filet from new york strip, so when you get porterhouse, you are basically getting both filet mignon and new york strip). On top of that, I think part of the plate was too hot, so the remaining meat that's left on the plate got overcooked. And here comes my comparison #2 - I may not be a hardcore steak eater, but I like to enjoy the meat pure, without any sauce. All steakhouses in Chicago we went to, not one place would serve steak along with sauce. They let the meat shine and I liked that. Here at Club A, the waiter also brought out some special steak sauce. Call me harsh, but whenever you had to serve sauce along with steak, it's either an insult to the steak meat, or you don't have confidence in your meat by itself so you need sauce to add more flavor to it. And the sides were just not that good. Mushrooms were drenched in some sauce, Brussels sprouts were undercooked, fries were A-OK. Anyways, did I mention they brought us complimentary mushroom ravioli AND complimentary dessert plate? That just made up for 1 star and hence the 4 stars rating. I think I'd come back here, and will probably just get the filet mignon and hoping to get the complimentary dessert plate again.",0,0,1,Lu H.,"New York, NY",294,570,1967
2.0,1/25/2014,"It took about 30 minutes after getting the menu to actually put in the order. I started to look around to see if there was an order desk I'd missed or a buffet. I got the ribeye (finally), and it was exceptional. Top shelf.She had the filet mignon and it was decent. Trying to find a wine they actually had on the list was a comedy routine. We went through 4 or 5 different wines before finding one they actually stocked. Why not nip down to the liquor store and grab a few bottles or at least some inkjet paper and ink to reprint your wine list to reflect what's in the cellar?Service was poor. The waiter started out with a lame joke you'd expect at Applebee's and then pretty much disappeared. Trying to get the staff's attention was a constant challenge. I think the waiter realized that he left us stranded and comp'd us a dessert. Fake cream and stale pastry. All in all, a real shame because the steak itself was so good.

4.0,1/22/2014,"Came here last night for my birthday. And because it's fresh on my mind I thought to do the review now...Here are a few things that impressed me :- The Escargot, as an appetizer, was a HOME RUN. I've only had escargot a handful of times but this was by far the best.- Ordered the Porterhouse for 2. The steak was obviously delicious. What stuck out was how lean the meat was. I know fat gives it flavor, but ours seem to be on the edges. Made it much more enjoyable. - The restaurant gave us two complimentary dishes. A mushroom ravioli and dessert. It was a nice gesture to combat an expensive meal. What I would've liked to be better : - Bread and spread selection; especially for a Steakhouse.- Entree's sides. We had the creamed spinach an mashed. They were good just not great. Small servings, as well. Overall, I really enjoyed Club A and most of the reviews from here were spot on.

The first two floors have bars along with table seating, while the third floor has table seating and views of the restaurants wine room and a fireplace.  They also had a jazz band playing but where we were seated on the third floor we could not hear it, but there was music playing softly in the background so I was still able to have good conversations over dinner.The food was phenomenal.  We received a complementary appetizer of stuffed mushroom ravioli.  In addition we had the calamari as a starter.  As our entree, we did Porterhouse for 4, medium rare along with truffle mac and cheese, asparagus and roasted brussel sprouts with bacon and Parmesan.  The steak was perfectly cooked and all the sides were delicious.For desert they gave us a platter of cannolis, tiramisu and cream puffs.  This is definitely one of the best steakhouses I have been to.  The food was perfect and the atmosphere was classy and intimate.  The prices were a little lower than expected which was an added bonus considering how much we got.I highly recommend this place for any occasion and the food beyond the steak is phenomenal as well.",3,0,3,Drex H.,"Hollis, NY",155,114,48

3.0,1/11/2014,"The normally 5-star Club A Steakhouse seems to be operating more like a Club C+ Steakhouse these days. And that's unfortunate because me and my boys throw a big yearly party here, renting out the gorgeous third-floor private room with the large outdoor balcony. Service and ambiance continues to be excellent, but this year I found the steak to be off. At almost $200 per head, I believe there is no room for error for a restaurant like this. I realize when you are cooking for 12 or more people, it can be challenging for the kitchen to get everything out at the same time, hot from the broiler. And although I always order my strip medium rare, I do have the expectation of having it come out hot, not cool. But it was a cool steak I received last night. There's something good to be said about steakhouses that serve their steaks on 900 degree plates. Club A does not subscribe to that methodology. To boot, I found my strip to be dry. While I know the ribeye is recommended for those who like a juicy steak, I am a strip guy. And I have had many a delicious, juicy strip steak.

5.0,12/21/2013,"I hesitate to recommend this spot. Not because it isn't a great restaurant. It is. But because some really good places I like to keep private, unknown.  But this spot has to be talked about. First it is still family run and you can tell they take pride in their restaurant. The staff is very friendly. From the General Manager on down they know how to keep the balance between being welcoming and friendly but not invasive.The restaurant is very pretty, warm and inviting. There are two wood burning fireplaces for ambiance. The small bar area in the front is usually crowded but the staff is efficient and they make a nice cocktail. Nice mix of high end brown liquors.The food is great. Porterhouse can be ordered for 2, 3 or 4. It is the best cut to share being both the strip steak and the filet. The steaks are great, well prepared. Fish is very good also. The shellfish appetizers are very good. Fresh. I don't eat desserts but I was tempted by the carrot cake and had a bite. Very good. The reviews from other diners are that the other desserts are just as good.Club A is going to be my go to Steakhouse in that area.",3,4,3,Tim C.,"New York, NY",266,150,0

4.0,12/21/2013,"Amazing dining experience.Great service, great vibe, and loved their live music. We ordered the porter house - medium rare. The only complaint would be that the middle was a little too rare (a bit cool), but it really was an awesomely seasoned quality steak even without the sauce.Appetizer wise their mac and cheese was excellent, whereas the brussel sprouts were not as good. Steak tare-tare was well seasoned, but definitely not their strength. Other people liked it, but the Canadian bacon was a bit too salty for me.A nice bottle of cab from Hess Winery for a reasonable price definitely sealed the deal for us!",9,4,5,Ken P.,"Manhattan, NY",34,111,29

The service was also pretty good, as was the house wine.Where it disappointed was with the steak which of course is why you are there. The Eagle steak was a too tough, salty and charcoal burned in the wrong places. The sides ranged from average to good so no recovery to be had there.In response to the feed back, the owner brought a sample of the filet mignon out for comparison and it was much better.

I was anticipating a nasty hostess, a sneering waiter, and glares from management.  Instead, we got a warm welcome and sympathy for the holiday traffic we were forced to sit in. This place is awesome as a date spot, I'm almost mad I showed up with 6 animals.  Candlelit with fireplaces and live musicians.  Gents if you have a lady, bring her here ASAP.  Appetizers were good.  Crispy fried calamari and creamy buffalo mozzarella.  Then we were treated to homemade mushroom ravioli on the house.Porterhouse and Ribeye steaks were perfectly cooked, super tender, served on sizzling plates of butter, and delicious.  The sides (which are usually overpriced and mediocre at steakhouses) were equally great.  Truffle mac&cheese and truffle cream spinach = bomb.com as were the brussels sprouts with thick cut bacon.Then, we were treated to a dessert platter of tiramisu, carrot cake, ice cream, etc. also on the house.    Overall awesome experience, this place is a hidden gem in Manhattan.  Don't waste your time with the overhyped chain steakhouses.  Club A is where it's at.",7,4,4,Vincent T.,"Long Beach, NY",387,180,3

5.0,12/1/2013,"I hosted a small party in the wine cellar at the Club A Steakhouse, and I could not have asked for a better experience.  The wine cellar is a fantastic spot for a party of about 8-15 people; wine crates make up the ceiling, the walls are a granite-looking stone, and of course there are the wine bottles themselves--which all dampen the sound and makes for a very pleasant noise level.  The lighting is nice, the chairs are comfortable, and they top it off with a rose and candle on the table.  Only one thing I wish I had known ahead of time--the music in the room is controlled by an  ipod player (pre-iphone 5), so if you reserve the room, you can make yourself a play list!  There was no room fee; just a reasonable minimum if you're ordering from the regular menu, or you can pick from several pre-set options.  All of the steaks were delicious, and they brought out a couple of different dipping sauces that were great.  We also tried a bunch of sides--the mac & cheese was my favorite, but the hash browns and brussels sprouts were also particularly popular at the table.  Someone also ordered the french onion soup, which I hear was outstanding.The service was great, and they were accommodating with letting us use multiple credit cards.  I will definitely be back!",2,0,0,Nicole W.,"Mamaroneck, NY",0,40,1

I called over the manager and shined my iPhone light on the meat to ask him of the char was on purpose, and he said yes. I ate it all, cause I'm a glutton and it's good quality meat after  all, but the charcoal parts were definitely a turnoff. Mashed potatoes were fine, as was broccoli.

5.0,11/28/2013,"My girlfriend and I ate here the night before Thanksgiving. Bruno, the owner, is a man who knows how to run a business. The staff is excellent and made us feel like regulars even though this was our first time.We ordered the escargot, which had far more than you typically get elsewhere, and an order of the Maryland crab cake to start. The crab cake must have been made to order, because they turned our one order into two smaller crab cakes and served them individually. Up next was a complimentary mushroom ravioli, which was so delicious, my girlfriend wondered why it wasn't on the menu.The 16 oz. filets are no joke. I ordered mine medium rare, and when we were served, we were asked to cut into the steaks to see if they met our expectations. We ordered creamed spinach and a baked potato to share. My girlfriend said the creamed spinach was the best she's ever had. At this point, Bruno, the owner, came over to ask how the food was. I jokingly asked for the recipe for the spinach. Not a moment later, a server brought a second serving of creamed spinach, on the house. Bruno's doing, no doubt. By this point, my girlfriend was full, and had barely touched her steak. Bruno came over to make sure everything was okay and then said if we didn't finish anything, we wouldn't get dessert. Our plates were cleared, the table was cleaned, and then more clean plates and silverware were delivered. We weren't sure why or what was coming, until our server returned with three desserts -- all complimentary. Cream puffs, tiramisu, and chocolate cake. When dessert is free, you don't ask for it to be wrapped up, so, full as we were, we stuffed our faces. Every part of this meal was excellent.

2.0,11/25/2013,"My husband and I wanted to try a new dining experience during our trip to the city and decided on Club A based on rave reviews left by the Yelp community. Sad to say, it did not live up to expectations they set. Let me explain by category...4 stars for ambience, has the setup to be romantic but it was pretty noisy and the red walls are covered with framed pictures forces me to take it down a star.3 stars for the porterhouse for 2 cooked med. rare (in most spots) but I couldn't get over the fact that it was probably the greasiest piece of meat I've ever ate. Don't get me wrong, the filet side was amazing. But the drippings+butter additions was a bit overkill for me. However, my husband did enjoy that extra flavor.Here's the kicker for me...I have to give 1 star for sides based on flavor and value...we had brussel sprouts, mac n cheese, & garlic fries. Brussel sprouts were OK, some more done than others but OK. Garlic fries were OK but a bit soggy and seem to be an after thought in execution. As for the mac n cheese...I couldn't eat it. I also noticed the people at the table next to us also couldn't either. ..it was so overly dressed with truffle oil it made it unbearably funky to eat. 5 stars for service... it was our fault for not communicating our displeasure with the sides at the time but really, who wants to complain in a setting that's so obviously setup for a special night out.

We got asparagus as a side and it was tasty, but not really a necessary purchase on our part. We were too busy digging into our steaks, so those ended up being tossed at the end of the meal. The staff was extremely friendly and courteous. They even sent over a complimentary appetizer AND dessert! The ambiance was lovely. Dark red walls and carpets, large comfortable booths, tall candles on each table. The choice in music was a little interesting - a lot of ""Americana"" songs, like Miss American Pie.

The porterhouse was cooked to a perfect medium rare and the sides complimented the steak very well. The creamed spinach was so decadent and rich with truffle oil and the potato puree was smooth and buttery deliciousness. The service of our waiter was a bit disappointing considering the raving reviews about great service. Not sure whether it was because my boyfriend and I were probably the youngest patrons at the restaurant, but our waiter came off snooty and seemed to brush us off and accommodate to the other tables more than ours. We saw that other tables with different waiters were getting great service which made us wonder whether we lucked out and got our waiter. Of course, I'm not expecting a royal treatment, but I was peeved about the attitude of our waiter considering that he made us feel uncomfortableOn the other hand, the waiter servicing the table next to ours (Danny) was very kind. Danny saw that our table was not serviced and took the initiative to service us for the rest of the night. Danny made sure water glasses were filled, asked us whether we enjoyed our meal, and brought out a complimentary dessert plate with cream puffs, carrot cake, and tiramisu for us with ""Happy Anniversary"" on it, which I thought was very thoughtful! The owner came out to wish us a happy anniversary and was very kind. This restaurant and its service staff is great, but we were just bummed that we got short ended because of our waiter. The restaurant focuses on the little things and puts thought in the little things. For example, our menus had ""Happy Anniversary!"" on it and when my boyfriend went to the restroom and put his napkin on his seat, Danny was there immediately to fold his napkin nicely and place it on the table.

After noticing Club A had over 1100 reviews at 5 stars, I knew this must have been a truly special place and needed to see first hand what made people so happy after dining.I'm very glad I made that call, because everything that night was everything I hoped to celebrate the occasion.  From the specialty drinks to the perfectly prepared and seasoned steaks, the food was spectacular and by far the best of all the great meals we enjoyed that week in New York. The filet and side of macaroni and cheese was a fantastic combo, and if I had to choose my last meal this would be the one.As great as the food is, what makes Club A unique and so top notch is the service the owner Bruno and his staff provide. He came out personally a few moments after we arrived to greet us and let us know if there was anything we needed to let him know.

We ordered a bottle of Australian Shiraz. Everything was absolutely perfect. It was a very comfortable atmosphere with enough room to get around and not knock anyone over. The other patrons were a range of ages from couples in their 20s to older gentleman, and everyone looked incredibly happy. The noise level was ideal.

3.0,10/25/2013,"Club A is one big cliché. It's not bad, but practically everything about it feels a bit off, like all clichés. It's outdated. Nothing about it is done in good taste: the food is ok, but the meat isn't quality meat (both the porterhouse and the rib eye hugely disappointed), and all the sides - baked potato, fries, bacon and creamed spinach - were all just ok, but none were great (the bacon is good though), and the desserts (which were all on the house!), including a chocolate cake, tiramisu, pumpkin pie, and cream puffs, were forgettable. The mushroom ravioli (also on the house!) was actually tasty, but again, practically everything else was just so-so. And while I appreciate the free food, it seems that there's a reason they're giving away so much free food - to compensate for otherwise mediocre meal. The service is good, but not great. The decor is somewhat tacky, like in a Russian restaurant in Brighton Beach - not attractive, tasteful, homey or inviting. The music wasn't chosen well either, and neither were the lighting or the seats and tables. Basically, nothing in this establishment feels authentic or is memorable. The overall experience feels like eating in a catering hall, or a tourist trap, or a gaudy wedding, not in a great steakhouse, which Club A is certainly not. Bottom line, as much as I wanted to like this place, I simply cannot recommend it, nor will I return to it. This was the consensus among all us 4 diners.

Our waiter was phenomenal and helped make out dining experience unforgettable. He gave us complimentary items throughout our meal, which was unexpected but wonderful. The owner came by our table twice to talk to us about our meal, which was great as well and we had a chance to talk to him right after our meal as well! Overall, great service!!Atmosphere: we were seated upstairs and the decor, music, and lighting was perfect for an upscale, intimate steakhouse.Drinks: they have a huge wine list, which was perfect for us! We wanted bottles of Cabernet and they had many options to choose from. We settled on Two bottles from mondavi winery in napa valley. We definitely enjoyed our choice!Food: AMAZING. They gave us a bread basket with an assortment of breads and crackers. Like I mentioned above, the waiter brought each of us a plate of complimentary mushroom ravioli, which was delicious! A few of us weren't even fans of mushrooms and thoroughly enjoyed the dish! 3 people ordered the filet mignon, 1 ordered the Kobe beef burger, and I had the lemon and thyme roasted chicken. Everyone enjoyed the main entrees - all of the meats were tender and flavorful! The fries and onion rings that came with the burger were also delicious! As far as sides go, we ordered the steamed broccoli, creamed spinach, whipped Yukon potato purée,  truffle Mac, of which I tried the broccoli and Mac. I loved them both, and my friends enjoyed everything they tried.  We also tried the hollandaise, mushroom, and au poivre sauces which were all delicious. The waiter brought by a complimentary plate of desserts which included 5 cream puffs, a slice of cheesecake, piece of tiramisu and a slice of chocolate cake. Although already stuffed, we devoured the delicious desserts! I thought the chocolate cake was extremely rich though so I focused on the other three items :)Overall, we had a FLAWLESS experience.

2.0,10/17/2013,"This a strange review for me. For some background I am a steak connoisseur; I also visit different butchers to see the quality meats and I enjoy cooking steaks to perfection. Also I am not just in the business of the consumption of beef since  I also have parents that ran a cattle ranch for over a decade for the purpose of if creating healthy and quality meat. I'm not an expert but I know my stuff. One of the things I ask myself when eating at a steak house is, "" Could I have done better myself "". In the case of club a steakhouse I could have and I have done better steaks than what I ate at club a. So I ordered a ribeye medium rare. Typically medium rare cones from the kitchen as rare or from rare to almost medium rare. In the case of club a their medium rare came out as medium. Barely pink with a very hot center. Right off the bat this makes for, IMHO, a tougher steak. Regardless of the doness it was not a tender steak with lots of flavor. I was even holding out hope for that one section of the steak that was good and had some tenderness and flavor all it's own....... Alas even the  cap of the ribeye, the most flavorful part of the ribeye, failed to deliver, because it was over cooked and dry. Now to qualify this a little bit..... Applebee's would be ecstatic to serve this sort of steak. However, a high end restaurant charging $48 for a ribeye should be embarrassed. So what saves the rating from being a one or two star? The service saved the day. The staff was on point and they delivered free mushroom ravioli and desert which were both really good. Also the 'house' Cabernet was kenwood at $9 a glass. Bottom line, if you are out on your 40th birthday alone a looking for an amazing steak experience, go somewhere else. Where else? I know Zeas in NOLA had better steak at half the price..... Just saying.",0,2,0,Jason N.,"Duluth, MN",0,17,1
5.0,10/15/2013,"This is the best restaurant and dining experience we've ever had, hands down. Excuse the excessive use of flowery food language but I'm not exaggerating. My husband and I came here a couple months ago during our anniversary weekend and were seated right away when we arrived about a half hour early on a Saturday night. We were taken to our table by the ""host"" who we chatted with and later realized is the owner of the restaurant, and we told him we were in town celebrating our anniversary. We were seated at a lovely table by the windows upstairs, and there was a nice view of the tree outside which was covered in little white lights.The dinner was candlelit and quiet, and the ambiance was just so nice. The owner sent over two glasses of champagne for us to toast while we were waiting for our appetizer.We ordered the sizzling Canadian bacon and the crabmeat cocktail as our appetizers, both were generously sized and tasty. To our surprise, we were also served this amazing mushroom ravioli in a cream sauce, compliments of the chef. This appetizer is not on the menu but it was SO delicious. For entrees we both got the filet mignon and shared sides of steamed asparagus and french fries. The filet was cooked perfectly, the asparagus was seasoned and just the right amount of tender, and the french fries were crunchy and salty. As if we weren't already impressed and feeling spoiled from having champagne and an appetizer sent to us on the house, the owner sent over a dessert plate with ""Happy Anniversary"" on it in chocolate. They really went above and beyond to really make our celebratory dinner special and we appreciated it.The service was impeccable, very attentive and gracious, and they really focused on making you feel important..at one point when our dinner was arriving we had four servers at our table. The timing was perfect too--we never felt like we were waiting too long for food but we also never felt rushed. It was a very leisurely dining experience. We spoke to the owner again afterwards to thank him for he and his staff's hospitality and to compliment his amazing food, and he said that he really feels that people come to a restaurant to get a full experience and enjoy themselves while getting great service, and our evening at his restaurant really exemplified this. For the quality and service, it was an amazing value, worth every penny (and it's really actually inexpensive compared to some of the other places in the city).If you're in NYC, especially for a special occasion, do yourself a favor and get yourself to this restaurant.

4.0,10/14/2013,"A coworker was visiting the New York from Shanghai, and all he wanted was a great steak (they don't really do that over there). I had heard great things about Club A before, and it seemed like the perfect excuse to indulge. The atmosphere was perfect, a plush red paradise overlooking the tree-lined street. My dining partner couldn't get over the ambiance. We both got the filet mignon (mine medium-rare, his medium-well), and they were cooked to perfection and suited our very different tastes. One thing I really enjoyed about the filet here was the subtle salt crust on the outside of the meat. Perfect. My only gripe related to the side sauces. I'm not one to obscure the flavor of good meat in a sauce, but I tried a little of each to get the full experience and found them surprisingly chilled (not ideal for hot meat) and a bit bland. As I said, I'm not a sauce person when it comes to filet, but they could use some work. We got brussels sprouts as well, but they didn't live up to my expectations (I come from a brussels-obsessed family, so my standards are freakishly high). Not enough flavor from the bacon and parmesan, but the sprouts themselves were cooked perfectly. In addition to our order, we were also brought mushroom ravioli in cream sauce as a complimentary appetizer as well as a free dessert plate. The ravioli was lovely and the perfect complement to the rest of our dinner. The dessert plate was good, and offered a pleasing variety. At the end of our meal, a man who appeared to be the manager stopped by our table to ask about our food and talk about Chinese (my entire meal had been conducted in Mandarin, and I'd also translated the menu and waiters' comments for my coworker), then offered us complimentary glasses of wine. The service was friendly, professional, and perfectly timed throughout dinner, so this was just the crowning moment on an already very satisfactory dining experience.Overall, the service here is fantastic and the meat is even better.",1,1,0,Christina V.,"Philadelphia, PA",101,58,33

3.0,10/13/2013,"In a city filled with so many fabulous restaurants that fulfill my inner foodie's quest for the best, I was ""almost"" disappointed with Club A.  I usually find myself saying how (most) NY restaurants completely smash any attempt Los Angeles restaurants put forth at dining greatness.  Los Angeles has good to really good restaurants, some even coming close to great, but usually L.A. just fails.  Sorry, but it's true.  Regardless of all that, I have found a Los Angeles-based steakhouse (Mastro's) that TOPS a New York institution...... that being Club A.  Sorry, I know it's just one person's opinion, but here it is.....Club A was very good, don't get me wrong, but it wasn't the ""shizzzz,"" or whatever the hip, cool slang is nowadays.  I'd put this at 3.5 stars if I could.  While Mastro's is my favorite, I'd also rate Tom Collicchio's Craft Bar in Las Vegas (the only one of his I've tried) better than Club A.  My standards are based on the following...Flavor.  While Club A's food had good flavor, it did not ""send"" my eyes rolling to the back of my head, or uttering ooooh's and aaaaah's out loud as I'd bite into their food.   It was good and solid, but not triumphant.  Mastro's and Craft Bar's food hits it outta the park with flavor and is super delicious.  Craft Bar has a Béarnaise sauce that truly makes me sing, and while Club A served it as well, it was only decent, and not the classic version.  At Club A, I think the Caesar salad was the most flavorful item I had.  For my entrée, I had a lamb chop here.  Tasty, but again, nothing worth noting.  At Mastro's, their lamb chop is so incredible, there are no words.....well, there are, and you should just read my Mastro's review, but it's definitely NOT worth noting at Club A.Food Preparation.  At Club A, my lamb chop was moist, but it wasn't medium rare as I had asked.  At Mastro's, they know how to prepare it to PERFECTION.  At Craft Bar and at Mastro's, I also had ribeye steak & porterhouse, and those were also perfection.... I rarely eat steak, but when it's cooked to perfection, I make allowances.  I tasted filet mignon at Club A, and while good, it wasn't great.Portion Size.  Okay, in all honesty, this is my biggest gripe about Club A.  At both Craft Bar and at Mastro's, their portions are truly huuuuuuuge and can be EASILY shared.  As often happens, I go to these restaurants not all that hungry, and even if I am, portions are so huge, there's no way I can eat one meal by myself.  At Mastro's, ONE meal of lamb chops is actually TWO racks of FOUR ULTRA MEATY chops..... that's EIGHT chops basically.  Now, at Club A, they offered ""double"" or ""triple"" lamb chops...translated, that means 2 or 3 lamb chops, and they were small and worst yet, they were fatty.  At Mastro's, all fat was trimmed off.  You can imagine my disappointment...and by the way, since I was sharing with my daughter (at Club A), we even asked which to get, and they said, ""Oh, just get the 'double,' you'll be fine.""  We got it, we looked at each other, and I was anything but fine.  I was pissed.  The poor lone lamb chop, remember we were splitting so we each only had ONE lamb chop, was lost on our plate.  As much as we tried to fill it up with the sides, our plates were empty.  So, moving onto the side dishes, as with most steakhouses now, and certainly keeping in unison with that of Mastro's and Craft Bar, the side dishes are for sharing.......more than for one person.  However, at Mastro's and at Craft Bar, they are made with anywhere from 4-6 to share EASILY.  At Club A, we had 5 among us, and the side dish portions were more like for 3 people comfortably.  Yes, we made it work, but especially for my daughter and I, we probably would have taken more.  May I note that FOR THE PRICE, yes, I expect more bang for the buck........the lamb chop thing was an utter disgrace..... for the same price as 3 measily LITTLE and FATTY chops at Club A, I could get 8 huge, perfectly cooked chops at Mastro's.  A major rip-off.The last of it is that Club A knew it was my daughter's birthday celebration, and yet, they completely forgot to bring her some dessert with a candle in it.  They did nothing for it, but I had arranged it ahead of time, so I said nothing, thinking they'd have remembered on their own (esp. since I confirmed the reservation that day and they mentioned it then).  I know people forget stuff all the time, but since we had a weekend long celebration, and other restaurants remembered, I figured Club A should have, as well, especially since it was her actual birthday day.I definitely appreciated the $15.00 discount they offered for being a first-time customer.  That was very nice.  I just want to reiterate one thing.... it wasn't a bad place, but it wasn't our finest meal, either.  In a city of great restaurants, and because we don't get to NY all that often, I really doubt we'll go back.  There's just too many places to try & some dazzling ones that I would definitely set my sights on.",2,1,1,Claudia B.,"Simi Valley, CA",1144,1299,6819

4.0,10/4/2013,"Excellent food and highly accommodating service. We were a demanding family party of 8 celebrating a big birthday. This celebration would have gone smoother had we the foresight to make reservations earlier than one night prior and reserved one of the private rooms. Alas, no private rooms were available last minute but we were assured the corner of the room we would be sat at would be private. Unfortunately it was not private enough, as we had to plug in a computer and do a quick PowerPoint presentation during dinner (don't ask), and this would surely disturb the diners around us. After some repeated begging, and being told numerous times that the private rooms were occupied the super nice management finally relented and told us we could use the private room for dessert. Now we could enjoy our meal which was quite delicious. Everyone agreed it was one of the best steaks they've had yet. I had the fish which was delicious but was cooked with a bit too much butter for my taste. I also wished they had the tuna steak which I was initially interested in ordering, but they were all out.The only thing I'll take a point off for is the waiter repeatedly forgetting that one member of our party was lactose intolerant. She kept having to remind them and at some points send some food back as it clearly had dairy.Once we moved to the private cellar room for dessert we mentally kicked ourselves yet again for not reserving in advance.

5.0,9/30/2013,"Club A Steakhouse is hands-down one of the most romantic and delicious restaurants in New York City.  We came here for my husband's birthday last year, and it was so wonderful; I have yet to find a restaurant that's as romantic, cozy, and wonderful as Club A.  The dining room is quiet and open with a live fireplace.  The service is exceptional and friendly.  We were treated like royalty, and never felt rushed.  We ordered a bottle of wine and they poured it into this adorable heart-shaped decanter.  I then realized that every table had a different shaped decanter, which is kind of a neat unique touch. My husband ordered the NY strip and I ordered the filet mignon.  Both were perfectly cooked and just divine.  They have an awesome assortment of sides to choose from and we had a hard time selecting just one so we got 3 sides.  The 5-truffle mac was ah-mazing!  Oh, to be a kid again and eat mac-n-cheese at a fancy schmancy steakhouse.  The creamed spinach was also amazing, plenty of cheese and cream but not too heavy.  We also had the yukon potato puree and it literally melted in our mouths.  I can't wait to come back to Club A again!  It's definitely a splurge, and not something we can afford to do everyday.  But well worth a delightful date night.",0,0,0,Nicole T.,"Manhattan, NY",84,272,13

4.0,9/23/2013,"A big thank you to Club A. I've been once before on a date with my fiancee and recently booked this for a group of 4 guys to celebrate a birthday (mine) and a groom-to-be. None of the other 3 in my group had ever been here so after a short wait we were seated upstairs which is the much more impressive (and excellent date spot IMHO) of the 2 floors. As 4 hungry guys are wont to do, we ordered the canadian bacon appetizer, a bottle of cabernet and a combination of porterhouses and ribeyes, all medium rare.Bacon wasn't as fatty as expected which was great, salty and delicious bacony goodness. The cabernet was a reasonably priced midrange that was suggested as going very well with red meat ($~65) and the advice was on point.For the main dish, this is the only part I deducted a star from. Asked for medium rare porterhouse and ribeyes, however it was slightly overcooked throughout. We should have asked first how the medium rare tends to be here but we expected a bit of blood but instead got mostly pink centers making them chewier than we wanted. Flavor was still there for sure, seared into the char layer present on all the steaks.For sides, highly recommend the wild mushrooms and if you have the stomach capacity the german hash browns.  Sauteed asparagus was fresh but nothing special and only came with a dozen strands at most.Showing how great the service is though, the menus had congratulations printed on it, servers were very attentive and the manager (I think) definitely all came by to check on how we were. At the end of the meal, they even remembered these special occasions and brought a plate of desserts over for us on the house. A very nice touch to end the meal.Will definitely be back but be sure to check on how the heat settings work here. I will the next time. Thanks Club A for a great dinner.",0,0,0,Chris L.,"New York, NY",35,45,3
5.0,9/23/2013,"I have been at the Club A steak house once before and I finally convinced my husband to try it out- he was very pleased and he told me that he will trust my taste from now on. Club A has a very cozy laid-back atmosphere, romantic and not overly formal.  We had a great table in a room with a fireplace and soothing live jazz music.The service was excellent - quick but didn't feel rushed.  Our waiter was very attentive -he suggested the Sea Food Platter (shrimp, lobster and crab-meat) and he was right it was perfection. My husband and I ordered the porter house medium-rare; the steak was everything you could want: juicy, tender, well-seasoned and cooked exactly how we asked for. I cut it with a BUTTER KNIFE! Yummy.

2.0,9/23/2013,"I really want to like this place. I was expecting way more after reading all the reviews.Firstly, we had a reservation for four at 8:00 PM on a Friday evening. We arrived around 3-5 mins late (subway yo), but I don't think it was unreasonable. Upon giving our name to the maître d', we were told to wait a few minutes. This ended up being almost twenty minutes of just lounging around the bar area. We didn't want to get any drinks as we were heading to an open bar afterwards at 10 PM (this comes into play later).Eventually we were seated at a small yet comfortable table along the wall. We mentioned that it was one of my buddy's birthday dinner. We ordered an escargot appetizer. I ordered an aged bone in ribeye as my entrée, and paired it with a Decoy Cabernet Sauvignon. Their wine selection was decent, although that is not my forte. We told them that we had a coupon for $15 off of a drink, which meant that we got a free glass.So far, everything was going decently. Our appetizer came out promptly and it was perfect. The escargot was cooked to perfection and seasoned very well with a garlic butter and herb sauce. I wish I could have eaten more! Definitely the best escargot I've ever tasted. The wine was good as well, and I was saving most of my glass for the steak.However, this is where our experience went downhill, very slowly. At this point, we waited about an hour and a half with no word on when our entrees were coming out. We were slowly getting agitated, as our waiter was no where to be seen and we had to get to the bar by 10. Eventually, the owner came and gave us a mushroom ravioli on the house (which was absolutely delicious, the mushrooms were incorporated extremely competently in the sauce and filling) and apologized for the wait.After almost two hours of waiting, our steaks finally came out. They were extraordinarily underwhelming. The outsides were charred to a crisp, and while the insides were cooked well, it seemed as if they've been sitting on the side of the grill for a long amount of time. I couldn't taste the fact that it was an aged steak; it was not very complex in flavor whatsoever. The plates and food were not hot whatsoever. I also ordered my steak au poivre, and the sauce that arrived on the side was delicious. My side of creamed spinach was good.We didn't really complain, seeing as how we were on a tight schedule. And as I mentioned, I really do want to like this place. The food was delicious, except for the steaks. I can see why it's such a loved restaurant, and I'm sure we just got unlucky with something. The owner was very friendly and made rounds a few times.They offered us a complimentary birthday dessert, with a slice of chocolate mousse cake, tiramisu, and cream puffs. The chocolate mousse was perfect, and everything else was good as well.Honestly, I think that if you went here you'd definitely have a better experience than we did, but for me this was the worst service I've had at a restaurant of this level.+1 star for the wine+1 star for the escargot+1 star for the mushroom ravioli+1 star for the dessert-1 star for the service-1 star for the steak",6,5,1,Tom Y.,"New York, NY",325,243,257

My wife had the onion soup which she enjoyed.I had the NY strip which was cooked perfectly and well seasoned. My wife had the sea bass which was fresh and finished to get it nice and crispy on the outside. We shared a baked potato and spinach which were fine.Before we could order dessert, they brought us some on the house! We had tiramisu and profiteroles. Delicious.The service was a little slow and our waiter was fine but not particularly friendly.

While we were waiting for our food they gave us a sample dish for free. Then the main course was excellent, we had the prime NY strip and lobster ravioli and they were both very delicious. The money spent for the meal and service was well worth it.The only con of the night was parking. On the website it says that they validate parking at Icon parking garage and I parked in the parking garage closest to the restaurant (they were on the same block) assuming that it was Icon.

I had a ceasar salad to start, which was good, but overdressed.  My husband ordered the fries which tasted all right.  They came out with a thing of homemade steak sauce, which actually tasted like homemade ketchup.  As much as we liked the steak, we won't be coming back here or recommending this restaurant to anyone anytime soon.",0,0,0,Jamie H.,"Bel Air, MD",0,5,0

The waiters seemed nice and friendly and the suggested courses and appetizers for us to try.  For appetizers, we got the broccoli soup an salads.  The soup was a bit on the salty side for us, but the salads were crisp and refreshing.  What I would recommend the most about this place is asking the waiters for what they would recommend.  They are really knowledgeable about the food there.  Hands down the recommendations were for their main dish they are known for, which is the porterhouse steak in medium rare.  The steak comes out on a sizzling plate, and they plate it on your dish for you.  It is quite possibly one of the best steaks I have ever had, totally melts in your mouth with great flavor.  The price is about $48.00 per person, which is reasonable for a good steak house.We also ordered the Mediterranean sea base on his fish recommendation, and that was also spot on with their crab meat sauce. Unfortunately the free ranged chicken (not what he recommended) turned out to be one of the most dry pieces of chicken I have ever had.  No bueno.Also our main dishes took about 40 mins to arrive.  It was pretty excessive in our opinion.  We asked about why it was taking so long and they mentioned it was the chickens fault due to them having to prepare it on the spot when ordered. The reason why I am giving them 5 stars is because what the waiter recommended  was outstanding.  Also they made up for the fact that the chicken was too dry / the  long wait time by secretly taking the chicken order off the bill and by providing a free desert sampler platter.  Excellent customer service in my opinion, will definitely be coming back.",0,0,1,David L.,"Santa Barbara, CA",28,203,120

Perhaps the best thing here was the service. We received several items complements on the house (mushroom ravioli & Canadian bacon) and the waiting staff was excellent. My water glass was rarely empty for long. As far as the food goes... it's okay. Solid, but not the best I've had as far as steakhouses go. Let's start with the sides. The Canadian bacon was pretty tasty, but other than that, the Truffle Mac & Cheese and Wild Mushrooms were okay but lacked any kind of wow factor. If you're going to a steakhouse, don't skimp out on the steak. Know what you want and order that, regardless of price. If you need help, ask the waiter, who will be more than accommodating in helping you figure out what choice of cut you want. Personally, I like my steak a little more fatty so I ended up ordering the Dry-Aged Rib Eye medium rare. The steak was cooked exactly to request... but I found it to be a little salty. Still good and tasty, but again, not the best that I've had. Overall though, a very pleasant dining experience. The problem exists for me though that once you've had exquisite steak (or any expensive food in general), anything not up to that level will seem okay to you at best. Still, there's great service and solid food here though. TIP: Don't fill up on bread. My friends made that mistake and a couple ended up being unable to finish their meal.",2,0,1,Justin H.,"New York, NY",132,137,0
5.0,8/21/2013,"Best restaurant week experience I've had.. ever!! Great food and amazing service and would definitely come back. The staff were SO nice and didn't make us feel unwelcome at all, which can sometimes happen if you're doing restaurant week or some other deal at a fancy restaurant.When we arrived, we were led to a really nice table in the middle of the restaurant. The table was bedecked with roses -- and complimentary glasses of champagne, a great start to the meal! I loved the decor - the atmosphere felt classy, intimate, and timeless. The red color throughout reminded me of an exclusive 1920s club or something.The food is simple, high-quality, and very generously proportioned. The canadian bacon starter is HUGE. For the entree, I got the filet mignon while other friends got the hanger steak. Both were great but I would say I preferred the hanger. The truffle oil spinach side was deliciously creamy like everyone says, and the mac and cheese was another favorite. The only thing I might avoid is the trout, which wasn't too special (it's a steakhouse after all).Finished up with a simple dessert. We were already stuffed by this point, but the staff offered us creme puffs as a final dessert. Usually I love free food but I could barely finish eating the tasty creme puff. Walked (or rather, stumbled) out of there completely stuffed with delicious food and blown away by the great service.",1,1,2,Michelle R.,"San Francisco, CA",58,101,51
4.0,8/21/2013,"*3.5 stars*From my bf's past experience from visiting Club A Steakhouse I picked a date that steered clear of restaurant week. Service: I must admit the service was impeccable throughout the whole night. We were offered our table even though one person from our party was running a little late.The waiters were all very polite and attentive. Our entrees and sides came right after we finished our delicious complimentary ravioli appetizer. That was when we remembered we forgot to order the  bacon everyone on yelp was raving about. We placed in the order right away and got it in no time as a complimentary from Mr. Bruno. Props for the complimentary appetizers from Mr. Bruno and the waiter who asked if I would like to take a photo before he served the bacon. I completely forgot about taking photo of the bacon as I was too busy indulging my steak.  Food: It would have been nice if there was some olive oil to go with the bread. The sizzling Canadian bacon was delicious. Nicely charred. It was hot and not too oily or salty. 5 Cheeses Truffle ""Mac"" was slightly watery that I like it. Creamed Spinach was well balanced and tasty. My hanger steak lacked seasoning. It also came our rare when i ordered medium rare, but I ate it anyways. I figured they handled it properly so it shouldn't be a problem. Shortly after dinner I got a stomachache that lasted for about 2 hours. I hardly ever get stomachaches. Perhaps I am just not use to eating rare meat. Note to self: never eat rare steaks again.",2,0,0,Shirley Y.,"Oakland, CA",9,146,238

3.0,8/16/2013,"This review is based on Summer Restaurant Week 2013.My wife and I decided to take advantage of this deal being offered at Club A Steakhouse with early dinner reservations after work on a Tuesday evening.Upon arrival, we were greeted by the hostess and were immediately guided to our table which was on the 2nd floor.  Our table included a semi-long stem rose with a candlelight to enhance the mood and overall atmosphere.  We both commented on the somewhat tacky decor they used.. felt as if I was trapped in some 1980's European / specifically Russian type feel.  Anyhow, we can for the real reason.. to enjoy the steak people have been telling us about.Just to break it down, this is what we had from the RW menu:Appetizers- Classic Caesar Salad - tasted fresh with crunchy croutons and light dash of dressing- Bacon - Very good and wasnt too oily.  Still think Lugers makes the best but this does come as the front runner for 2ndMain Entrees- Filet Mignon 10oz (Medium Rare) was prepared very well and perfectly cooked.  The center was nice and pink with some blood oozing out that was exactly how I wanted it,  Unfortunately my wife's Filet Mignon which was butterfly'ed was overcooked and not as tasty.Sides- Creamed Spinach - probably the highlight of this meal overall.  Tasted wonderful with the perfect addition of butter- Mac & Cheese - Nice and charred crust on top of the creamy goodness.. well doneDessert- Tiramisu - not something I would order here as it wasn't anything special... maybe it's because I am bias about ever ordering this since I'm not a fan- Cream Puffs - also a major disappointment as it lacked flavor and real sweetness to the taste.. very blandOverall, I think the restaurant is just OK.   I would have to think about coming here again if I do make a return visit as next time I would stay away from the RW menu.",0,0,0,Carson W.,"Great Neck, NY",113,141,0
5.0,8/15/2013,"I came here from Hawaii on vacation with my mother and best friend and let me say this was one if the overall best dining experiences I've ever had. I don't believe I'm newbie in dining either. I've just come off of multiple trips from Australia, Japan, and Korea and have eaten all over the world and this place by far was one of, or the best dining experience I have had.Let me start with the service Bruno(the owner) has his service time and his management on point. I mean top notch old school make the customer happy and be polite. Bruno and his service team has elevated my dining experience to the top.When we chose to dine here hey had a special with an appetizer, entree,  starch, and dessertWe had Caesar salad, Canadian bacon, and calamari.All three were very good but I'd have to agree with the rest of the reviews and say that the Canadian bacon just stood out to me with its smokey goodness. A must get if you have to choose.We all decided to get the filet mignon which was awesome and everything I'd expect from a filet mignon. Very tender and cooked to our liking (medium rare, medium).For our starch we got the truffle spinach, Mac and cheese, and garlic French fries and once again all were great but id have to say if you had to choose then get the truffle spinach! So awesome I swear it was great.Dessert we got both the tiramisu and the cream puffs. I gotta say both were once again awesome. The tiramisu was great not to strong alcohol tasting not too weak and not to sweet either. It was just perfect. And the cream puffs were just awesome. Soft and light in flavor. Not to heavy and nice to end a meal with.We also chose a white wine and at the time they had a  deal on wine. We were worried that the deal wine would be not to our likings but it was actually very nice. Yes... I know red wine with steak but my mom loves white wine.An overall review? Go here! It was awesome, the full package. Some places have great food some have great dessert but this place had both. The best overall experience I've had in dining!

4.0,8/15/2013,"Came here for restaurant week with a friend on a quiet Tuesday. I loved the interior and decor of the place. I settled on a four star review because I would give 3 stars for food and 5 for service. My friend and I each had Caesar salad, the filet mignon and a side of mac and cheese. Honestly none of them really wowed me and the mac and cheese actually was actually a thin and watery disappointment.The service, however, more than made up for the so-so meal. Everyone from the host to the bartender to the waiters was extremely friendly, courteous, and fun. Eating here felt like eating a friend's house. Our waiter stopped by to check in how things were and make conversation, but did not linger as he could tell my friend and I were catching up. At the end of the meal as we were finishing our wine and waiting for the check, the host came over and invited us to have a drink at the bar on him. I know they wanted to turn the table, but I felt it was a very gracious way of him to do so.

Had an average caesar's salad for appetizer. Wasn't impressed by the meat that everyone rated so high, and the french fries didn't seem homemade.

They have three floors, each slightly different from the rest, which is pretty cool.The third floor has an outside balcony that you could go onto, with a decent view of the neighborhood. The tables here are mostly for 2 people, so it's a great spot if you are looking to impress on a first date. For my meal, I got the steak tartare, hanger steak and tiramisu. The steak tartare was delicious, with sweet pieces of onions and capers throughout. A perfect appetizer to start off the meal. They also make a killer Canadian bacon, but it's a bit on the fatty side.My hanger steak, unfortunately, was cooked medium well, when I asked for medium rare. It was pretty tough, and not as flavorful as I would have liked. The sauce they included was also really bland, which wouldn't be an issue if my steak was juicier.But my dessert, the tiramisu, totally saved the entree. Everything about it was amazing, from the cream to the chocolate sauce to the consistency. They also had complementary fresh fruit and cannoli. Oh and you get to choose a side.

We got a nice big table upstairs (somewhat disappointing as the live music was downstairs but that's OK) and proceeded to dine. Honestly, the crowd in there was a bit hilarious, but maybe that's because it was restaurant week (horrific overly casual clothing and lets just say some NewJerseyesque outfits. Also quite a strange demographic). On to the food - Cesar salads to start - truly delicious (prob the best I've ever had); Filet Mignons as our entrees - YUM- and sides of mac and cheese and creamed spinach - super yum. Food was really good and portions were large so no complaints there. We got tiramasu for desert, which I physically could not eat because everything was SO filling, but hubby enjoyed. Someone at a table near us said that all of the menu items are doused in butter, which may or may not be true. They threw in 2 cannolis at the end of dinner as well, and wow super delish (you can't say no to a cannoli!) . I might not return however bc 1- prices are very high (to be expected at a steakhouse) 2- I'm not a real meat lover and this was probably my once a year steak dinner and 3- there are SO many places in the city, so unless someone specifically suggests this spot for dinner, I will move on to the next one...",1,1,0,Mila K.,"ASTORIA, NY",125,87,23

Salmon was a very basic dish and went untouched, the Veal Osso Buco was the most disappointing - rice was poorly cooked if you look at Andrew J's photo - it looked like something from a food truck and also tasted like it too - the rice has such a bad fishy flavor, I was actually surprised how bad it was SERVICE: 3.5/5Our server was a nice guy, but unmemorable.

5.0,7/29/2013,"Enjoyed a meal here Friday night at 9:30 pm for restaurant week. We ordered the hanger steak, filet mignon, Caesar salad, lentil soup, creamed spinach, potatoes, Tiramisu & cream puffs. Complimentary bread was a treat as well w/softened butter. All the food was 5 stars. We both liked the filet mignon better. Personally, I liked the potatoes better with the red meat, as opposed to the creamed spinach. They are flavored with truffle oil, and delicious but I prefer the potatoes. What a deal for restaurant week. Definitely worth it to try one of the top rated steakhouses in NYC during this discounted time. The restaurant is clean, romantic & unique. The lighting was low, with a candle and fresh red rose on our table. The seating is comfortable and spacious enough for large or small groups. There was a group of about 12 seated across from us comfortably. Our table for 2 was located in between 2 other tables, and I had no problem feeling privacy with my date. The music has a lot to do with that. They put it at the perfect level of volume. We liked all the songs they played, too. We sat on the 2nd floor near the bar, and on the ground level there were 2 musicians. Their music periodically played over the entire restaurant's speakers. But they mixed it well with other memorable hits from a CD or wherever they played that from. I would love to go back for a special occasion, or bring my family here when they come from out of town.

5.0,7/26/2013,"This is perhaps my sixth visit, and perhaps the best yet. It starts with a personal, very warm greeting from the family, which includes the owner, Mr. Bruno, and also his son, who commands the reservations. Ambience is consistently great. Downstairs is traditional and warm, with soft lighting, spacious seating. Upstairs is a bit younger and more Parisian. This was Restaurant Week, so that menu was a bargain $38, including first course, main, side dish, and dessert. Plenty of choices in each category, large portions, and absolutely delicious. (The regular menu is still available).Some dishes worth mentioning include the terrific Caesar salad, which has the perfect amount of Caesar dressing , cheese, and fresh plentiful lettuce. A great salad.Sides included a wonderful braised Brussels sprouts with chunks of Canadian bacon (I ordered this ala carte). This could be a meal in itself! Unbelievable. Another side I just loved is the four cheese ""Mac and cheese"". It doesn't get any better, just so rich and cheesy. And, their creamed spinach is one of the best, just the right amount of creaminess, and lots of flavor.For mains, we had the salmon filet, and also the Osso Bucco. Both were prepared perfectly. I always respect a steakhouse that can serve great salmon.For dessert, we both had a delicious Tira Misu. I think this one is right up there with the best.What stood out for me this time, and made the experience the best yet, was the exceptional service and attention to our every need. There were a lot of wait staff and bussers, and they were available with just a glance, to help us with whatever we needed. It is more service than you are used to in NYC, or anyplace for that matter. Just great.Last but not least, I want to mention, this is one of the best Martini drinks in Manhattan. I've sorta gotten inured to small Martinis at high prices. Here, you get a generous martini, served ""up"" in the largest martini glass I've seen, perfectly prepared, at a reasonable price. It is great. Come to the bar just for a martini!In summary, the combination of warm welcoming and appreciation by the owners, excellent food, large portions, and fair value for the money, in a comfortable, well-appointed ambiance, make this a well-deserved top rating. Thank you again Mr. Bruno! Cannot wait to return!.",2,0,0,Richard T.,"San Francisco, CA",10,229,45
3.0,7/25/2013,"My lab chose this restaurant for my friend's farewell dinner. Trying to catch the cheaper restaurant week menu, we had a reservation for 9 at 7:30 but because the party showed up late we got our orders in closer to 8pm.The bread basket they give in the beginning is pretty generous in portion (includes pretzel sticks and crackers as well). I ended up ordering a mixed green salad, the 10 oz filet mignon with a side of truffle oil infused creamed spinach, and the house tiramisu.First off, we were forced to pay 20% gratuity because we had a large party but if it were up to me I would probably not even had paid the minimum 15%. The service was below par for what many claim to be a higher-end restaurant. Food came out very slowly (our dinner lasted nearly 3 hours / the candle burned out for crying out loud!). However, the manager did give us complementary cannolis as well as an extra tiramisu to make up for getting our food out so slowly.Now onto the food itself! The mixed green salad was your typical salad - greens, tomatoes, onions, blue cheese, etc. Very fresh though so that's a plus. I ordered my filet mignon medium rare but it was closer to medium in my opinion. Either way, very tender and juicy. The seasoning was also good, not too much. The crust was slightly charred which is how I like it but that's just preference. The creamed spinach was a little too much for me. I don't know why but it just wasn't what I was expecting it to be. The tiramisu itself was a delight! Very light and fluffly and the coffee flavor really came out. I wonder if they used Kahlua to really bring out the flavor. Complementary cannolis were good too! Some of the other lab members ordered a slice of Canadian bacon-extra thick as an appetizer. My goodness the bacon alone could have been an entree. You also had your standard fried calamari. The pork chop was also really tender and juicy. They really do the meats well I must say.I would definitely come back here to try out some of the other items like the trout. Just maybe not during restaurant week as the service seems to be sub-par.",0,1,1,Brian C.,"Montville, NJ",85,18,9

5.0,7/24/2013,"By far, my second most favorite steakhouse in NYC (right behind Peter Luger's). With so many faux & spinoff steakhouses in Manhattan, you'd think it more difficult to be the one place a NYer would think of when they're in the mood for steak outside of Williamsburg.I've visited Club A twice and both times I had more than satisfying experiences - family style. It first starts when you walk into the door and are greeted by the owner himself, Bruno Selimaj, an easygoing, down-to-earth overseer of all things delicious (in a dapper suit). Then began the most amazing culinary experience compared to any steakhouse in Manhattan - Lobster Cocktail, Smoked Norwegian Salmon (5 stars), and some other good stuff that I won't get into right now...but if that wasn't enough, Bruno, the observing patriarch, noticed that we were inhaling the Lobster Cocktail and served another gratis. Like a superhero, he saved the day and walked away!Alas, the story continues: while waiting for what will be the most delicious and perfectly sizzling porterhouse - the kind that melts in your mouth and not in your hand - our server, per Papa's instruction, brought us each an individual dish of one exotic mushroom stuffed ravioli the size of a mini frisbee. Now, I don't like mushrooms but this was AWESOME! I'd eat it again and again and again. I was amazed and completely enthralled by the distinct flavor of each 'shroom enveloped within the creaminess of the homemade Alfredo-like sauce. I wanted more!But then came the grandfather of all steaks - the porterhouse - and again I am carnivore. This is by far the most amazing steakhouse in Manhattan and I've tried them all - from the atmosphere, to the service, to the food, and the free accouterments - this place has got everyone beat.

The Caesar salad and escargot were absolutely amazing and we split the Porterhouse steak for 2 with mashed potatoes, mushrooms, and creamed spinach.

We heard about this place through word of mouth and a relatively generous Groupon offer and I am beyond happy to say that this may have been the best meal any of us have had in a long time. We decided to forgo any appetizer and just dig right into our main course: 3 Filet Mignons with sautéed spinach, creamed spinach, and garlic fries. While our waiter, Duke, was absolutely incredible, the wait to get our food was a little long. He still made many attempts to take care of us and keep us laughing. Great guy. Our food eventually came and we were all left speechless. The spinaches were delicious and the fries were pretty good. The stars of the show were the steak. Legitimately melted in your mouth. Charred on the outside but still juicy on the inside, it didn't even need any of the sauces (bernaise and peppercorn were the best we tried- mostly on the fries). The owner, Bruno (an extremely friendly man), then came by and profusely apologized for our wait and then sent over a free dessert platter. So damn good. That cannoli/tiramisu was outstanding.

5.0,7/21/2013,"This place was amazing and for how good it was surprisingly not crowded on a Friday night. It would make a fantastic date night spot or a great place to go for a special occasion - the ambiance was stellar with candle lit tables and a single rose in a vase on each table; make sure to ask to sit upstairs if seating is available - there's a giant window and while there's a large tree in front of the window it still adds to the atmosphere - we ordered shrimp scampi, Chilean Seabass, and whipped potato purée and all were out of this world. Wait staff was knowledgable and attentive without being overbearing. This really is a gem of a place and the manager/owner (not sure) checked in during our meal and as we were leaving to make sure we had a good experience - he even offered us a drink on the house when we raved about how amazing everything was.

The second time was with a few friends for a full dinner experience, with the steak and all the works. Both times were pretty satisfying.The steak tartare is one of the better ones here in Manhattan, and thought my choice of a baked potato worked really well with my steak. The steak itself was prepared pretty well, with the right amount of juices retained in a lightly charred exterior. This steak is seasoned a bit more than at other places (still not seasoned as much as it is at Peter Luger's, though). The service was excellent, and the ambiance provides a very pleasant dining experience, especially upstairs where it is not as loud as the bar floor downstairs.

5.0,7/16/2013,"My boyfriend and I had a wonderful experience at Club A Steakhouse! The restaurant was decently busy for a hot summer Monday night. We started at the bar around 6:30 and then moved to the upstairs dining room (definitely recommend upstairs for the sunlight and street-people-watching aspects). The service was EXCEPTIONAL (even the owner checked on each patron) and the food was delicious. There was a nice mix of oldies/motown music playing at a good volume and the ambiance/setting was nice in an 'old school' way (lots of rich red accents, mahogany, and velvet... but not stuck-up or pompous at all... very relaxed and fun). Not including drinks, the meal came to about $115 (I guess normal for two people at a steakhouse?).We ate bread (nice variety and warm), ordered 2 slices of the Canadian Bacon (very good, but we should have only ordered 1 slice), ate mushroom ravioli (compliments of the chef! YUM), I tried the blackened swordfish (fresh and excellent) and my BF got the 16 oz. Filet (cooked perfectly and he said it was good) and we shared sauteed broccoli and spinach as sides (also very good). THEN another 'compliments of the chef' dish came out - a huge plate of dessert (two mini cannolis, a big portion of tiramisu, and two cream puffs with chocolate mousse and whipped cream and fruit).

As mentioned in other reviews, Bruno's generosity is extraordinary: we enjoyed complimentary mushroom ravioli pasta as an appetizer and dessert plate at the end.

While the waiters were incredibly nice and tried to be accommodating, the service was really not up to par.  Upon arrival, I always expect to have water glasses filled, menus given out, wine offered.  These things I consider to be basics.  After 20 minutes I had to find the waiter to tell him all of the following.  Then it took another 40 minutes, at the very least to get our appetizers.  It was more than 2 hours after we arrived that our entrees were served.  Once the table was cleared, we waited another hour and a half for our desert.  I mentioned to the waiter several times that we have young kids with us and wanted to have things wrapped up by 8pm at the latest, but we didn't get out of there until past 8:30 and that was after we just walked out without our tea, which was promised with dessert but never came.  What a disappointment from a place that really had potential.  As for the quality of the food, I would give them a solid 4.  I have to give it to them though, their truffle mac and cheese was phenomenal.",1,0,0,Anna K.,"Brooklyn, NY",137,337,22

5.0,6/19/2013,"Impeccable atmosphere and service.My review is a bit overdue as I came here over a month ago, but I didn't have time to write a good full-length review.Anyway...onto the good stuff. the decor here is awesome. Very fancy. Red lighting. Well laid out space. You'll know what I mean the instant you walk in. The 2nd story is a lot better looking than the first story in my opinon, though there is live music on the first floor if you are big on that stuff.The top floor looks more restaurante-y and each table is well laid out and creates a very intimate setting. Good for dates if you need to bring one. I came with fellow yelper Jasmine C. and we were both HUNGRAYYYY.For appetizers she got the asparagus and I got the bacon. Bacon is good. Nice and juicy. Asparagus was good tooFor main course I got the double eagle prime rib medium rare. So here is my only qualm with my meal. I ordered it medium rare but I think their standards of how the steak is cooked is a half notch up. By that I mean...Medium rare is more similar to a medium (from my experience). Next time I go I'll definitely just get rare plus. Just as a heads up for prospective goers. I think I would have enjoyed my steak more if it was rarer to my liking. Other than this...no qualms.We also got the spinach and mac and cheese as sides. Mac and cheese was madddd good. Spinach was pretty solid as well. I suggest getting these along with the bacon as musts in your dining experience hereWe also ordered a bottle of wine and unlike other places, they actually bring over a large decanter to let the wine air out and make it an overall better experience while eating your steak. Definitely props for this. And besides...decanters just look cool.I think what was really the defining moment of our dining experience here was the free glass of house wine and free platter of dessert that got unexpectedly sent to our table. So during the course of your meal, as many other yelpers mentioned, the owner, Bruno, will walk around and talk with his customers. He came over to our table a couple times and we shared a couple of laughs and funny exchanges and next thing we know...2 glasses of wine and a BIGGGG platter of dessert appeared before us. We are talking ice cream, tiramisu, and this other ice cream thing...for just 2 people! I ate it all down!As a final shoutout, just want to say thanks Bruno for the awesome dining experience.

The food (2 filet mignons - 1 medium rare and 1 medium, mac & cheese, garlic fries, bacon and calamari) were all extremely good, and we were both happy that our steaks were cooked to perfection.

3.0,6/3/2013,"At A1, the décor is warm and romantic, with rich red wallpapered walls and a fireplace glowing in the back. The service is generally quite good, with your water always full and the waiter taking the initiative to serve you more food when your plate looks empty. The owner also visibly roams the restaurant ensuring everything is running smoothly. The only exception to otherwise impeccable service was my glass of wine that I returned because it had floaters in it. (I'm not usually so hard to please but you set your expectations with the price point.) The second glass was no better - not sure whether it was because they didn't check it or because they just returned the same glass back to me. But I sucked it up and fished out the bits with my spoon. The jumbo lump stone crab meat was simple but delicious - in truth, hard to mess up. It's served with lemon, a mustard sauce, and cocktail sauce. For a side, we had broccoli rabe sautéed with garlic. It was tasty, but more or less what I'd make at home. For the entree, we had the porterhouse for 2, which as their ""best cut of meat"", was quite disappointing. It was a good steak, don't get me wrong, but as they say, it's all relative, and I could get a ""cheaper"", better aged and better marbled one at Peter Luger's, Wolfgang's, or Del Frisco's.  Also, while the middle pieces were perfectly medium rare, as requested, the outer bits were relatively well done (aka - dry). Club A has a nice ambience and would be a good place to take a date for a pre-dinner drink and/or appetizers, but save your $$$ and go to dinner elsewhere.",0,0,1,Cindy T.,"San Francisco, CA",111,101,383

4.0,5/29/2013,"Good steak - not the best I've had but pretty darn good.I ordered the filet - this thing was massive (16oz) , like you could cut it in half and easily have two portions.  I ordered Medium, but it came out medium-well; they must have let it sit for a while considering it was such a big piece of meat to be so well cooked.My date had the dry aged Ribeye which I thought came out better than the fillet.  They had a good and inexpensive Cabernet from Kenwood Vineyards in Sonoma - good selection without the pretense.Live music, good service, and a nice ambience kept it well rounded.  We were seated on the top floor overlooking the street and a nice big, LED lit tree.  I think if the steak would have been a tad bit juicier and cooked with higher heat, it might have gotten the extra star.  Still a very good place.If you love the color red, the entire place is decked out in it. $150 for two steaks, an appetizer and two glasses of wine with tip - not the cheapest, but certainly reasonable for a great tasting NYC steakhouse.",1,0,0,Arthur I.,"Beverly Hills, CA",23,54,10

Very attentive staff (our water glasses were never empty), and beautiful ambience. The live music is a great touch, and not too loud so you can either talk or enjoy the music. My father and I both had the escargot to start and the portion was tender (not rubbery like some places) and very generous - most restaurants only give 6 escargot as a starter, but they filled the plate - mine had 18! My mother had the tuna tartar which was also delicious (melted in my mouth), and large for an appetizer. She finished it and had only ordered a soup as her entree (she generally has a small appetite) and already felt full after the tuna tartar. Then we were each given a mushroom ravioli, on the house. Also lovely. The entrees were wonderful - I had the fish of the day special, branzino stuffed with crab, which was tasty. My boyfriend ordered one of the steaks of the day - an enormous T-Bone that arrived on a sizzling plate, perfectly cooked to be a little red/pink inside, and so tender. But I have to say that the entrees are enormous, so I think maybe next time we might share rather than each order our own - it was a little like an orgy of food (in the best way!) so while it was a perfect celebration, we came home sooo full. Given the way the menu is set up, I think the best bet might be to share a meat entree and a few sides among a couple people (maybe 2-3 people, depending on their appetites) rather than each trying to eat their own entree.And then they gave us a complimentary platter of dessert. OOF. And they were all so good, that we were really tempted to finish them all but were just too full. My favorites were the cheesecake, tiramisu, and the profiteroles (especially the profiteroles - so light and yet so luscious). My boyfriend also found the chocolate mousse cake really amazing.

5.0,5/18/2013,"When I decided to have my first ""Guys Night Out"" in about 2 years, my initial thought was to go to Peter Luger's. Been there a few times and it's a great place; just a pain to get to and to make reservations that aren't at least 2 months out. A friend of mine who had been to Club A Steakhouse suggested giving them a try for the occasion, and am I glad I did.To start with, I was able to score a private room so that we could truly make it a ""no holds barred"" type of guys night. One of the guys in my party had got caught in traffic and was late; but they had no problem seating us before he arrived. Not being a huge steak fan myself (though the other 4 guys in my party are), I decided to order the grilled tuna. The piece of tuna they sent me could have been mistaken for a steak filet given its size. It was served with both a teriyaki sauce and a spicy glaze on the side. Now, I've had huge pieces of tuna in the past where half of the filet is gristle. Not here. This giant filet was sashimi grade; hardly a piece of gristle to be found in it. I don't know where they found this tuna, but I hope they find more. After some cajoling from my friends, I wound up having some steak. I'm far from a steak connoisseur, but it tasted phenomenal. Juicy and flavorful; my next visit to Club A might make me a steak eater yet.In the private room we were given the privacy we wanted, but never felt neglected by the wait staff or the least bit rushed. We ordered desert and they brought us out a plate consisting of cream puffs, tiramisu, chocolate mousse cake and cheesecake; all of which were absolutely phenomenal. The owner, Bruno, even came by twice, once during the meal and once as we were paying the check, to make sure everything was to our liking. True class act. By the time the evening was over, we were telling our stories to the waiter and the night felt more like we were hanging out at a friend's house rather than in a restaurant in Manhattan.After last night, two things are clear: I can't wait another 2 years to get this group of guys together, and when I do, it's going to be at Club A.

5.0,5/17/2013,"I was looking for a classy but not too formal dining experience for a special occasion with my family. After asking friends and looking up on yelp, I decided on the Club A Steakhouse for a dinner on a weekday night. I made a reservation online through the restaurant's website. It was quick and easy. Later, I called to make schedule changes, and it was also quick and easy.Once my family got there, we were promptly seated. We said this was our first time and that we heard about the restaurant from yelp. The ambience was great. Even though we are surrounded by people, we felt that we had our own space for ourselves. The noise level was just about right, and the lighting was slightly romantic. After we finished our breads, which were actually not that good, the server brought mushroom stuffed ravioli for us to try for free. The raviolis were amazing and made my family crave for more. Then, we had our filet mignon cooked to perfection and just melts in my mouth. The outside is a bit crispy and salty while the inside is soft pink. Just amazing. :) We also had 3 sides: mac and cheese (my favorite), sauteed asparagus (must-get), & brussel sprouts with bacon (good but little too sweet for my taste). The server brought creamed spinach side as a compliment. The dish was fantastic. All the food went very well with a glass of wine.Overall, my family and I had an excellent dining experience and are very happy to visit again and to give recommendations to our friends. First and foremost, the food, especially the steak, is just amazing. Second, the ambience is great. Third, the logistics of making reservations and service are quick, easy and smooth. The house compliments were pleasant surprises.This is one of the best steakhouses I've ever been to!",0,0,0,Eric L.,"New York, NY",13,1,0

The prices are extremely reasonable and even downright cheap for the value of the exquisite meal, the warm atmosphere, and the incredibly friendly and attentive staff and owner. We walked in with travel bags they offered to take aside for us, invited us warmly with casual dress, and still gave us top notch service. The filet I ordered came out perfect and was succulent and flavorful. The brussels sprouts with bacon and parmesian were delicious, but the german hasbrowns take the cake as a perfect pairing of tart to the beauifully prepared steaks savory flavors.

5.0,5/16/2013,"My wife and I had a phenomenal dinner accented by superlative service and a personal touch by the owner.I had the bone-in filet - perfectly done and delicious. My wife had the trout - very light and flavorful. Not starving, we went without sides only to receive 2 portions - mashed potatoes and creamed spinach -  that miraculously appeared free from the kitchen. Tasty!  At the end of the meal, we received a tasting/sampler dessert plate that, too, was the perfect conclusion to the meal. The decor is warm, rich, red, and accented with pictures of the proprietor's status on the world stage.  After touring the upstairs to take in the plush and sumptuous surroundings, we were offered a cocktail at the bar. What a lovely evening!Frankly, still a bit perplexed by the tremendous and unexpected hospitality we received, I can only postulate that it was due to:A) I resembled the owner's long, lost relative orB) I mentioned Yelp when asked how we alighted there orC) My wife is pretty darn attractive orD) All the above.Bottom line - your mileage may vary but either way...forcefully recommended!",1,1,1,Thomas R.,"Littleton, CO",7,29,1

3.0,5/14/2013,I'm not sure how i feel about Club A Steakhouse. I just wasn't wowed and after reading the multiple reviews of people with and without a deal i'm leaning towards that it may be just a hit or miss for people. I made reservations last minute for monday night at 7:30 thank goodness i did because it was packed i was asked how i heard of the restaurant and i mentioned yelp (im not sure if that made any difference maybe she thought i was using a deal which i did not have). While we were waiting for our entrees we were given a complimentary appetizer of a mushroom ravioli with a creamy mushroom sauce that was delicious. While eating our appetizer we realized we did not recieve any bread and had to ask for it. When our entrees came out my porter house for two was not medium rare but more to the medium not a big deal because it was still delicious but not wow in my book. Later on i realized that there were sauces available which were not explained to us again we had to ask for it.  My mother's and sister's lamb were prepared properly and were quite tasty at least.We also noticed the owner spoke to everyone except us and we were there till it was almost emptied out. The bus boy attempted to scrape the crumbs off the table before dessert came but instead left the pile in front of my boyfriend and walked away i'm assuming he was distracted. For dessert i ordered the zabaione and was told it was with mixed berries and they prepare the zabaione in front of you with a tabletop stove. Unfortuantely it took a some time because they had to change the fuel canister and no one seemed to remember how to install it. Once the waiters had the stovetop working everyone was already halfway into their desserrt and what i recieved were strawberries in zabaione not mixed berries. I'm not a stickler for these things but for the amount of money i was paying and reading all the reviews i really expected a better experience in terms of service.,1,0,1,Reno A.,"Queens, NY",53,49,0

The appetizers arrived really fast, within 2-3 minutes of placing the order. Steak tartare was good, although a bit on a un-sophisticated side, with a bit too much onions. But we liked it, check.Then the major wait for our entrees had began. ABout 25-30 minutes after our appetizers were cleared away, the food arrived -- fillet mignon and hangar steak. Both done not as ordered. The medium rare fillet was overdone (still pretty good though) to medium-well and hangar steak was bleeding on my plate and hence rather tough to chew. The meat itself tasted good though, and from a good cut, I would give them that. The sides were ok, truffle oil creamed spinach and  mac and cheese...solid but not amazing.Finally the deserts arrived. Cream-puffs tasted bland and out of a store, and tiramisu was rather wet and nothing to write home about... definitely not a steakhouse quality, but more of an average NY deli/diner type.I really don't know what is all the hype about this place with 4.5 stars?!

5.0,5/11/2013,"I've taken way too long to write this review only because I wanted to provide Club A with as good a review as they did a meal to me.It all started when my friend and I discovered it was Restaurant Week in NYC when we were in town.  We decided we wanted a steak, and we cross-referenced the list of steakhouses with reviews on Yelp.  Club A had no competition with its amazing reputation on Yelp, so we booked our meal there with a 3rd friend.The meal was absolutely perfect.  A huge bread basket was provided on top of the generous 4 course meal.We each picked a different appetizer and shared all 3: steak tartare, Canadian bacon, and fried calamari.  The bacon was the stand-out as it was extra-thick, as advertised.  For our main courses we had filets and hangar steaks.  For our sides, we shared mac & cheese, creamed spinach, and mashed potatoes.  All 3 sides were huge!Before our dessert arrived the owner Bruno came by to say hello.  We ended up getting into a nice conversation with him about his origin and the history of his steakhouse.  He's such an awesome guy, and he ended up sending over a round of complimentary drinks to our table.  Classy!We enjoyed our drinks alongside our desserts of tiramisu, cannolis, and cream puffs.  All were great.Definitely one of the best steakhouse experiences I've ever had in my life, and ridiculously reasonably priced for RW.  Cheaper than a solo steak in a lot of steakhouse.  Definitely try to make it out for this event if you can!",7,1,4,Rob P.,"Austin, TX",2111,2530,1129

Dessert was Tiramsu  was smooth and creamy.  I really don't know what else to say that hasn't been said, I mean...people, come on.  Look at the Yelp reviews and the Star ratings this place gets!  It's not by accident  They also provide discount parking at a indoor lot across the street for only $12!

We ordered two Prime Dry Aged Rib Eye steaks, one medium well and the other one medium rare, both were super dry, chewy, almost burnt. I never ate a steak THAT dry in a restaurant that specializes in steaks, i couldn't even finish half of it. The other steak was bloody red inside and guess what, also super dry, I don't know how they did it. Very disappointing! Next, we ordered sides, mashed potatoes served in enamel chipped pot, they were salty and with bits of skin, I felt like I was in Applebee's, except the steak in Applebee's is better and three times cheaper, yeah, the steaks in Club A were that bad. Caesar salad was literally soaked in dressing. We skipped dessert to avoid further disappointment. Oh, about dress attire, 95% of people were wearing jeans...so much for classy.

It wasn't so I sent it back. They nuked it a bit & it was ok. Eating it however was something else. I feel like if you're going to charge $42 for a steak it should melt in your mouth. This was 1/2 grizzle & fat. One of the worst steaks I've ever had. The head waiter asked how everything was & I told him I've had much better. He was kind of insulted.

He should have sent it back too.  Since I recommended the place, I felt pretty bad that he didn't love his steak. I'm not taking stars away because of that though.   Anyway, based on the reviews, I was hoping for much more.  I also had the carrot cake for dessert, which did not taste fresh to me.  It tasted like it had been in the refrigerator for a while.  Ambience was very nice.  Service was good but not like what was described in other reviews.  It was a Tuesday evening around 6:30 and every table was filled, which is a good sign but sadly, I was a little underwhelmed by my first experience at Club A.",0,0,0,Lily C.,"Islip, NY",35,461,428

But by the end of my meal, none of that mattered.Service: Excellent. They were understanding and patient while we waited for the rest of our party of 7 to arrive. The owner made his rounds and stopped by almost every table to chat. He gave us a sampler plate of literally each of their desserts on the house. Then, when he found out it was my birthday, he gave us more ice cream.Wine: Only in legends have I heard of such decanters.Appetizer/Sides: I had the calamari to start, and it was forgettable. It was easily the weakest part of the meal, as it neither looked nor tasted like it belonged on the menu. For sides, I had 5 cheeses truffle ""mac"", creamed spinach, and wild mushrooms. All 3 dishes were excellent.Steak: I order my steak well-done everywhere I go. That's just how I like it. Club A does it right. I got the Prime Dry Aged Double Eagle Strip bone-in. Before I made even the initial incision, I could see that I was in for a treat. The meat glistened in the candle light, as if to whisper to my lips ""Tim... I am moist for you"". I both eagerly and regrettably cut the masterpiece before me. My eyes crossed as I watched myself bring the first piece to my mouth. What should have been a bite was not, as I found great pleasure in leaving this tender morsel as it were, on my tongue. I let it rest, and I closed my eyes, as I let the wondrous burst of flavor take over me. Basically, my steak was well-done, still tender, still juicy, and oh, so delicious - so much so, that I neglected to try the house steak sauce, which I had been previously looking forward to.Dessert: literally everything was delicious, and I can say that literally, because I had everything.May not have the allure of a Luger's or Keen's, but the steak here is at least on par.(o_O) Decor(^_^) Service(^_^) Options(^_^) Steak(^_-) Bang for buckGlad I came.

I ordered the hanger steak for the entrée, and while traditionally this is a tough cut of meat, I was hoping that this upscale steakhouse would do it justice. Unfortunately my jaw nearly fell off from fatigue from chewing this tough cut of meat. Did you ever just chew so much that your jaw hurt and you just didn't want to eat anymore because your jaw hurt? Well that was my case this evening. I had to cut the meat up into tiny pieces to make it easier to eat. The steak sauce accompanying it was similar to Peter Lugar's steak sauce as it reminded me of sweet cocktail sauce.

3.0,4/5/2013,"Apparently, the owners of Club A do care about reviews on Yelp.  I was contacted by the owner's son and invited back to try their restaurant.  After mulling over it for a couple of days, I decided to give them another chance.  This time, I included a couple of friends of mine to make sure I was not biased.  After going back and forth with the owner's son for a week and half, we settled on Friday night reservations for a party of 4.  (The long back and forth was due to schedule conflicts as well as little bit of unresponsiveness from the owner's son - no big deal, I know he's not a reservationist and had other things he's responsible for.)  Friday night arrived and the dinner began on a great foot, we were seated within 5 minutes of checking in and had a wonderful table upstairs facing the sparkling Christmas lit trees outside.Our table ordered a porterhouse for two, a NY Strip Steak and Salmon.  For the sides, we went basic with the mashed potatoes and creamed spinach.  The table had appetizer salads so we didn't go overboard with the sides.  The food came out perfectly and the steaks were all done as requested.  As we were on the tail-end of our meal, we were pleasantly greeted by the owner checking in on our meal and service satisfaction.  Now, I'm not sure if it was noted in the reservation to check on us, but it was greatly appreciated.  He even treated us to a free round of drinks, which was not necessary and such a sweet gesture.  Overall, Club A has easily earned another star on this reviewer's book.  (However, they're still not quite 4-star level since their beer still was still lacking.)",3,0,0,Lisa R.,"Denver, CO",259,1003,60
5.0,4/4/2013,"We went there tonight for dinner. It was fantastic. The service was superb. I had the fillet of sole, which was perfect. Two others shared the porterhouse steak which they said was also perfect. The appetizer, which consisted of 3 types of seafood, was excellent, as was the onion soup. The asparagus, a difficult vegetable to get right, tasted very good, as did the hash brown potatoes and mac and cheese. The servers were very polite and attentive, but not overly. I also very much appreciated that  although it is a NYC restaurant, the tables are not all on top of each other. One of my least fond things about many NYC restaurants is how patrons are all squeezed together so there is no privacy of the occasion. This restaurant takes that into account, so I did not feel like we were dining with our neighbors. The owner was very kind, and seemed to care a great deal that we enjoyed our experience there, which we did. Very impressive place. One of our party takes his law firm associates to meals for occasions, and this will be where they will go from now on.",1,0,1,Mary A.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,15,0
4.0,4/4/2013,"I went here with a few friends a while back and I cannot stop thinking about how good everything was.We ordered everything family style and shared everything and there was no leftovers (yes, that good)We started off with the oysters, fried calamari, crab cake and ordered a caesar salad to share. The portions of the appetizers were rather large and was enough to feed the four of us. The oysters were not that sandy and it was fresh. The lettuce in the salad was crisp and fresh as well.For entrees, we ordered the filet mignon,  kobe burger, and the pan seared salmon. The filet mignon was perfect! We asked for medium rare and the center was nicely pink. The burger was big and was enough to feed two people. Salmon was nicely cooked.They also have a nice selection of wines there as well.

5.0,4/4/2013,"This review is a long time coming. My boyfriend found this place during NYC Restaurant Week two years ago. It is is the ONE restaurant we go to every time Restaurant Week rolls around. Additionally, we had also gotten LivingSocial Deals here. This place is FANTASTIC. We came for our birthdays and than appeared again for our anniversary. They knew we had been there for our birthday (and my grad school graduation). We were seated immediately (we had reservations). The most recent visit here was during the Nemo storm and we still had incredibly attentive staff and it was a warm, inviting atmosphere. The food is unbelievable. I have had the salmon, the filet mignon, the NY Strip. They were all prepared with incredible flavor and exactly to my liking.The steak is high-quality and seasoned perfectly. The sides are delicious as well. We are partial to the whipped potatoes, which we order every time. The appetizer selection is fantastic as well. We have had the steak tartar, the calamari and the bacon. I love the calamari the most. It is crispy on the outside and perfect on the inside. It is a lot of calamari and perfect start to the evening. We have been given complimentary champagne to celebrate our special occasions. They do not neglect one detail. I only wish we could afford it more regularly. It is a place we will continue to come to for years. As life goes on and improves, we will come here to celebrate many a occasion. I already promised my boyfriend I would take him here to celebrate when I finally land a new job!This place might not be as well-known as some other places but it is the best around.

5.0,4/3/2013,"I planned our night at Club A Steakhouse for months.  We knew we were going to be in New York for my boyfriend's birthday, and we knew we wanted to eat some amazing steak to celebrate.  It didn't take much searching to decide that Club A would be the best option.It became an even bigger celebration after my boyfriend (now fiancé) popped the question earlier that day in Central Park!I was impressed with Club A from the moment I walked in.  The atmosphere was cozy and relaxed.  There was a jazz duo that played gentle music throughout the evening.  Our coats were checked free of charge.  We had a reservation (that was confirmed over the phone that day), and we were seated immediately.I didn't realize that this restaurant had a second floor, but I was delighted when we were seated up there.  The booth was soft and comfortable, and the decor was warm and romantic.  From the plush ceilings to the dazzling lights on the trees outside to the single long-stemmed red rose at the candlelit table, we couldn't have asked for a more romantic location to celebrate our lives together and toast to our future.We skipped out on appetizers and dove right into the main course and sides, as we had many sides we wanted to sample.  I had the filet mignon ($42) and my fiancé (I LOVE saying that) had the prime NY strip ($45).  Sides are priced between $7-$11 or 3 sides for $24.  We opted for the pan-fried mushrooms, the truffle mac and cheese, and the garlic fries.  The food didn't come out too quickly, which was actually appreciated.  When I visit restaurants like this, I want the chance to enjoy the ambience and take my time with the meal, and not be rushed out the door to make room for the next customers.The meat was cooked perfectly, and the sides were very sizeable.  We definitely couldn't finish everything!  The truffle mac and cheese was super creamy, and the fries were unbelievably good.  Even the mushrooms, which I'm not normally a huge fan of, were little grenades of flavour and were quite enjoyable.The only problem I had throughout the night was with our waiter.  He was really wonderful and was taking care of us and then all of a sudden, after our food was served, he just disappeared!  I literally have no idea where he went, or if he was just sent to another section.  When we finished, we had to wait awhile for the bill to arrive because our table had been handed off to another waiter.  All the waiters were all very capable and helpful, I just wish we could of thanked OUR waiter for taking such good care of us throughout the evening.Also, there was an obnoxious mutton-chopped man sitting nearby who was a nightmare the whole night, speaking VERY loudly and being very demanding.  He was so drunk by the end of the night that he starting banging his utensils against his table demanding his coffee and dessert be brought to him that second.  Good job to the staff of Club A Steakhouse for handling this difficult customer and keeping him from ruining our evening with his rude and horrible behaviour.We were given a complimentary dessert (tiramisu and cream puffs) to finish off the night, and we walked away stuffed, happy, and with pleasant memories of a beautiful evening spent in New York City.  Thank you Club A Steakhouse for being the cherry on top of an unforgettable day.",2,1,3,Kyla C.,"Toronto, Canada",17,111,84

5.0,4/2/2013,"I'm not sure how you can argue with 950 reviews averaging out to 4.5 stars - that's an impressive feat. The customer service at Club A is what makes it stand out above and beyond any other traditional steakhouse.My colleagues and I had dinner here last week to celebrate a new project, and everything was top-notch from start to finish. The hostess offered us the choice of upstairs and downstairs, and encouraged us to try the upstairs area since it was our first visit - it almost felt like it was too fancy to be there on a weeknight, but really brought the dinner to a whole other level. Our waiter was attentive and helpful in the recommendations for our meals.I don't think there's any need to go into detail on the foods we ordered - I will say, it's a traditional steakhouse, and the menu is somewhat predictable. The escargot, though, was the standout for the appetizer round. They also surprised us with a single lobster ravioli in between the appetizer and entree rounds. Everyone was pleased with the steak for the main courses. The three sides for $24 deal is nice, and then they even threw in a side of mashed potatoes. They also ""threw in"" a dessert plate, before we even had a chance to look at the menu! That's the way to go - the tiramisu and carrot cake were delish. Finally, they offered us a free 2nd round of our after-dinner drink of choice.Naturally, we left with a hefty bill but also very satisfied and very, very impressed with the service. So many times, restaurants overlook the fact that they're not just in the food industry.

5.0,4/1/2013,"Thanks to the people of Yelp for showing the way to the Club A Steakhouse. My girlfriend is a huge steak lover. I wanted to surprise her and take her to a steakhouse in the city. Lived here for years and never been to one before. I listend to the reviews on here and took her to Club A on her birthday. Best. Idea. Ever.We arrived on a weekday around 6. It was quite empty (besides the business men bar flies sitting at the bar). When you go, ask to be seated upstairs. The large windows are great! You won't regret it. The waiter we had was very nice and talked us into cocktails before we even looked at the menu and wine list. Nothing like sharing cocktails when you're picking out your food and wine. We ordered a bottle of red. I ordered the 18oz NY Strip and she ordered the Rib Eye. They offer 3 sides for $24 so we got whipped Potato Purea, 5 cheese truffle Mac and Cheese, and Brussel Sprouts with bacon and parm cheese. The potatoes were amazing the other sides were so/so. My NY strip was cooked perfectly. I usually have some sause on the side with my meat but I devoured my steak with out any. Unheard of for me! My GF loved her Rib Eye. She offered me a couple bites. I was happy we got different meats to share with each other. The whole time the waiters were coming by to check on us and refill our wine. The owner or manager (not sure which) came by a couple times and asked how we were enjoying the food, how we heard about them, if we were celebrating anything. When I told him we were celebrating her birthday he wished her a happy birthday and asked if we would like any after dinner drinks on the house. I mean, if you're offering! When they dropped off our drinks they also brought us ice cream and cheese cake with a candle on it for her to blow out. It was delicious. We were stuffed by the end. When I got the bill I was quite happy to see they gave us the desert and cocktails we ordered For FREE!Great food, Great service, Romantic atmosphere, good music over the speakers, and Oh yea the foods amazing.

The bacon is a big hit too but since I am not a huge bacon fan, I am a little biased towards it. My favorite part of the meal is the creamed spinach with truffle oil which is simply the best. (And the flute they use to pour your wine is pretty neat too.) If you're doing the prefixed menu, go for the hanger steak and not the filet mignon.

And all weekdays booked until 9 pm. But then I went to Open Table and they had pretty much every slot open. Interesting...My first impressions were that the ambiance is very classy without being too overwhelming fancy. However, I thought the attitude of the servers were kind of too hoity-toity. We had asked was Bearnaise sauce was and our waiter had given us a snotty look as if he were thinking, ""Really?? you don't know what Bearnaise is?"". Then for everything that came out, he over-explained everything like we had never seen food before.Aside from that, the food was pretty good. I got the Chilean Sea Bass while my boyfriend got the Bone-In Ribeye. And we shared the Truffle Mac & Cheese, Creamed Spinach, and Garlic-Herb Fries. They also gave us a complimentary Lobster Ravioli and a dessert assortment. I really enjoyed my sea bass a lot. It was very crispy on the outside while being soft on the inside. The Truffle Mac & Cheese was also delicious. You can really taste the truffle oil in it, and it makes a simple dish so much richer. I was disappointed by the steak. I'm pretty sure it was the rub that they used that I wasn't a fan of. I prefer the standard salt and pepper seasoning. The sauces didn't pair well either in my opinion. The lobster ravioli wasn't anything special. But I did appreciate that they brought us this free of charge.I was really blown away by the dessert platter that they brought out for us because it was our anniversary. It was humongous. We got cream puffs, cheesecake, and tiramisu. I don't really like tiramisu, but it was still pretty good. The cheesecake.... I'm not sure if that's what all NY style cheesecake tastes like, but I really didn't like it. The cream puffs, however, were amazing!Taste wise, I think it was generally really good food. Service was alright but a little on the slow side though. But it's obvious that they care about customer service a lot. The owner likes to walk around and talk to customers to make sure they're enjoying their meal.",3,0,0,M L.,"Irvine, CA",376,414,196
3.0,3/11/2013,"Ah, it makes me so sad to rate this place so low - I bought the Groupon deal (4-course meal for two) a few months ago and had really high expectations because of the stellar reviews. We came here for dinner this past weekend and had the following:1. Steak tartare - I've always been a bit hesitant about consuming raw beef, but this was probably my second favorite dish of the night (after the filet mignon)!2. Fried calamari - Not bad, but not great. We've both had better calamari in the past.3. Brook trout - Really good! The light flavors in this dish really helped balance out our meal.4. Filet mignon - Oh my, this was perfection. Cooked perfectly rare.5. Truffle oil infused creamed spinach - I'm not a big fan of creamed spinach, but my friend really enjoyed this.6. Mac and cheese - Holy truffle oil overload. They should have named this dish the truffle oil infused mac and cheese, not the creamed spinach. This actually made us feel super nauseous by the end of our meal, which is why I docked two stars.7. Cream puffs - Nothing special. The cream that they dolloped on top actually made the choux pastry a bit soggy.8. Tiramisu - Good, but I've had better tiramisu before.The service was impeccable, but other than the filet mignon, steak tartare, and brook trout - I'd say the food was a bit lacking.",2,0,0,Anne K.,"Philadelphia, PA",479,423,104
3.0,3/11/2013,"This was an interesting place.  I am quite torn on what to rate it, but I guess overall I can give it 3 Stars.Once you enter, the bar is to the right, making the walk way a little bit cluttered.  Once you pass the bar, the actual hostess stand is on the right hand side, tucked away in the corner next to the bar.  They are friendly enough but the staff sounds a little less formal than you would anticipate.  The first thing you notice about the place is that there is a lot of red.  Well it seemed romantic enough, but more of a 1950s, 1960s sort of romantic...So the hostess takes me and my cousin upstairs and allows us to choose any table.  That was interesting...  So we chose a table and sat down.  From there on out, I must say the service was spectacular.The food actually comes out quickly, we had the groupon with the pre-fix menu.  We ordered the Steak Tartare, Calamari, Filet Mignon, Veal Osso Bucco, Macaroni and Cheese, Creamed Spinach, Tiramisu, and Cream puffs.Steak Tartare was pretty delicious but the calamari on the other hand, it was good, but the marinara sauce, I would definitely not eat it, it was overly salty.  The calamari on its own was fine though.  The veal osso bucco was good, however the rice was way undercooked.  The filet, well I ordered it medium rare, and it came out medium and charred.  I ate a little bit, but it just tasted like ashes so I sent it back.  They brought out another steak, which apparently was a filet butterflied.  It was cooked medium well this time.  I just ate it cause it did not seem like they could get it right especially if they needed to butterfly it.  My suggestion would be for people to order 1 temperature level below what you were looking for so that you can get what you actually want.  The accompanying sauce tasted like cocktail sauce bah.  macaroni and cheese was good, even though there was a little black on the top, which some people might not like, but I enjoy and the creamed spinach was good.  The tiramisu was standard and the cream puffs mehhhhh.My major critique would be the steak though...  Do not call yourself a steakhouse if you cannot cook steak.  Everything else can be fantastic but if you are supposed to be able to do something, do it right...  That is all.  I was glad that I had a groupon for this place, because if I didn't I would think that it was a complete ripoff.",3,0,1,Kent C.,"Fresh Meadows, Queens, NY",345,314,422

5.0,3/8/2013,"Came here for my 2 year with my boyfriend so basically we went ALL out with the food. I'm proud to say, that I planned the date, and everything went smoothly. Upon walking in, we were asked to check our coats and there was a nice real fireplace burning. Cool.We went upstairs and were seated next to a huge window with a gorgeous view of a lit up tree outside. Food came, and it's pretty much just as good as the reviews say.  The appetizers were amazing: steak tartare and sherry gruyere onion soup for appetizers. Definitely recommend. By the time our main course came we were actually quite content. For our main entree we got the mixed grill for two...and holy crap, the portions were HUGE. It came with 5 spicy Italian sausages, two lamb chops,  two cuts of veal, and two cuts of filet mignon. Oh, not to mention we got sides of the triffle mac and cheese (amazing, btw), spinach, and grilled mushrooms. My bf and I are pretty hearty eaters and we came in starving, but by the time appetizers were over we were full. And by the time we were done with about half the entree, we were in a meat coma...Last but not least, the waiters brought us (along with about 3 other couples in the room) a three piece dessert of cream puff, tiramisu, and a to-die-for cheesecake saying Happy Anniversary on the house. We were stuffed but still ate the whole plate of dessert...Safe to say that we probably gained about 5 pounds each from that, and were still able to make really good meat sandwiches the day after.

Our waiter was excellent and the rest of the staff was very attentive but not intrusive.

We ended up chatting for a while and I could tell that he really personally put a lot of care into maintaining the quality of his restaurant  which impressed me.

The mac and cheese was alright.We got the filet, which was decent (again). I asked for rare, but I feel like it was a tad overcooked and switched steaks my friend.

5.0,2/24/2013,"On 2/23, we had a private event with a party size of 16 to celebrate my brothers bachelor party.A month prior, I called Club A Steakhouse to book this event at an odd hour expecting voicemail. Instead I spoke to a very pleasant gentlemen that provided me all the details of what they had to offer. He stated that this is not the usual business hours but will connect me with their event planner (Marsha) to solidify plans. He was kind enough to hold the wine cellar until I spoke to Marsha. Little did I know I was speaking to Bruno the owner, the entire time. Bruno's passion in his restaurant is clearly felt with every conversation you have with him.Th following morning Marsha followed up with me. She was professional and very patient with all my inquiries. She provided all the details of the menu options and the atmosphere of restaurant, exclusively the wine cellar. She even sent me photos via email. Throughout the event planning process I was well informed with no gaps of doubt.On the day of the event we were welcomed and accommodated by their staff as soon as we got there. We were escorted to the wine cellar and was fortunate to have Livio as our waiter. Livio was stellar. He was always available and never in the way. He knew the menu very well and was a shining example of the world class service Club A Steakhouse exudes. As for the steakhouse, the food, the atmosphere etc etc it is top notch and would rival the best steakhouses in NYC. My wife and I are steakhouse aficionados and have been to the best. They have the standards that meet the ones we love the most. The difference maker was Bruno himself. He ensured a memorable evening, decadent food, a striking wine cellar room, and most of all service excellence. He visited us frequently and delivered all that he stated he will while meeting our expectations.On that note, the best steakhouses will usually provide great dining experiences but it is the service & the food that will have you running back.

Calamari was great and my husband has a tomato/moz salad that was good also.  My husband order the porterhouse and I had a seafood special.  Both were great but very pricey.

We became hooked on Club A when we tried it out for Restaurant Week last week. This place is not stingy, like every other steak houses during Restaurant Week. You get several, top-quality choices, plus they offer special $25 bottles of wine. Not the best wine, but pretty good to start the meal and then open up a nicer bottle to enjoy with your steak. What especially stood out during restaurant week was their service, they don't treat you like a second class citizen because you are paying a fraction of the normal price.  The owner is constantly walking around, making sure everyone is pleased.Also, they are just plain cool. We have been there several times since then and once were there late one night with friends, the last table there. Any other restaurant would rush you along, wanting to close up.

4.0,2/5/2013,"It's pretty obvious if you looked on this website why a lot of people come to Club A. This easily has to be the most well reviewed steakhouse in the city. I was happy to come here on a Saturday to give this place a try. Was it worth the hype?When we arrived it was plain to see that this was a real date spot. Lots of young couples and young groups all well dressed for a night on the town. Not as loud and abrasive as some of the other high-testosterone, high-fiving, men's clubs that invade a lot of the steakhouses in this city. I guess the difficulty of getting a reservation puts the brakes on all that. Makes the occasion more special. They sat us down upstairs where we had a nice view overlooking the Queensborough bridge traffic on 58th street. At least it's a view of something, right? They had the tree out front lit up nicely with blue bulbs to add to the ambiance. I ordered one of the specials, which was a T-bone steak. At 22 ounces, it was a little smaller than what I'm used to but enough to satisfy a normal person. As tasty as it was, they did not cook it to my specification of medium rare. It was more of a medium with a slight pink inside. I knew there was something amiss when the waiter put the plate in front of me and said: ""It's cooked the right temperature."" If you have to reassure me before I even say anything, that's not a good sign. Like I said, the steak was tasty so I let it slide. No big deal. I guess I shouldn't have ordered the special. We also ordered two thick slabs of Canadian bacon as an appetizer. I had no idea how huge they would be or else we would have settled with one slab instead of two. It was very good but next time I will think twice about having meat with my meat. It was a little daunting eating two of my favorite barnyard animals in one hefty sitting. We tried the cream of spinach which was decent but a tad too soupy in consistency. We could have done without the brussel sprouts with bacon chunks. Nice idea but didn't quite work. I really wanted to try the mac and cheese but I looked at the table next to us and it looked a lot like Velveeta, as one other reviewer had mentioned. For dessert we tried the cheesecake and it was as good as I expected. The service here was very attentive. The owner really did his best to make it to every table to ask how everything was at least once or twice.

We were brought to the dingy little room on the third floor which they claimed to be the ""private dining room"" which seemed to us more like ""separate you guys from the full-price paying public"" space. And this place is racist too.  Everyone around us was pretty much young people or dressed down Chinese college students ( I am Chinese and saw 80 percent of the room were Chinese speaking people). The waiter was rude until we ordered two glasses of wine. There was nothing special about the food. The appetizer was interesting but so salty. The main and dessert were just a whatever. You could get the same quality meal at Applebees at much cheaper. I have to say this place is really snobby (for no reason---plenty of good restaurants out there better than this in NYC).

4.0,2/4/2013,"- REVIEW FOR 2013 WINTER RESTAURANT WEEK -Service was great. Steak was great/good. Rest of the food, eh...whatever.I really like the fact that their restaurant week menu didn't jip too much and was similar to their regular menu.My parents and I had the steak tartare, canadian bacon, and fried calamari for appetizer. My dad (who is EXTREMELY hard to please) said the salad for the steak tartare was too salty. I assume the steak tartare was fine then. The canadian bacon and calamari were fine. For entrees we got filet mignon and hangar steak. The secret to getting your food cooked correctly here is to ask for it to be cooked on the rare-r side. My parents were very happy (HARD to do) with their filet mignons. My hangar steak was a bit chewy and I didn't care for it all too much. For sides, we got creamed spinach, garlic fries and mac and cheese. All but the garlic fries were good! Very disappointed w/ the garlic fries...McDonald's could have made them better. -_-"" For dessert, we got the cream puffs and the tiramisu. Both didn't leave much to be desired. We did get canolis on the house and those were delicious! Crunchy and filled with sweet (but not overly sweet) cream on the inside. YUM. In the end, we were VERY filled as the portion sizes were good. We also ordered the wine special of Malbec 2012. It was sweet and alright, but what is to be expected from $25 bottle of wine?!So my parents liked their food and were very happy, which made me happy. They said they would return.",0,0,0,Kah L.,"JAMAICA, NY",0,6,0

4.0,2/3/2013,"With all of the Living Social, Restaurant Week, Groupon, Gilt City deals that this restaurant offers, I kind of don't understand how anyone would ever pay full price to eat at Club A.I will say that the staff is not snooty about whatever deal your party has arrived to dine with. We came on a Saturday night and inquired about the Restaurant Week menu. Our waiter explained that usually they didn't offer RW on Saturday evenings, but after inquiring with management, he arrived back at our table with the RW menus, which I thought generous.Between the four of us I sampled the steak tartare and thick-cut bacon appetizers. The bacon is a force to be reckoned with and quite imposing when they plop it down in front of you. It's like 8"" x 1"" of pure guilt. Mostly filet mignons all around and general approval from the table.I mostly wanted to highlight the excellent service. A particularly picky diner at our table asked for au jus as a side to her filet, and our waiter obligingly returned with a selection of four different sauces - an au jus, a bearnaise, and mushroom and au poivre reductions.  Which goes to show you, ask and you shall receive.",4,1,2,Alice L.,"Manhattan, NY",89,173,0
5.0,2/2/2013,"Club A is officially my new favorite restaurant. There are so many great restaurants in NYC but this place just gets it right. Every little bit of it. From the service, to the presentation, to the large, delicious portions. My boyfriend and I went for a restaurant week dinner and it was amazing. Everything was delicious and they did not limit anything just because it was restaurant week. The wine was fantastic, the servers were so nice and the owner walked up to us twice to ask how everything was going.

2.0,1/31/2013,"my husband and i came for my birthday on 1/29.  This was our first time here.  we live in the neighborhood but have never come here because we don't eat a lot of steak any more.  We used to be regulars at Ben & Jacks which is a really terrific steak place.  Because of the yelp raves i wanted to try Club A.  Here's what happened.1. I made a reservation and asked for a romantic table.2. We arrived and stood around while the maitre d smoozed with the regulars ignoring us while we stood there with out coats in our hands.  We stood there for 5 minutes until someone finally took our coats.  2 minutes later a woman came and told us that our table would be ready soon.  Since we had been regulars at Ben & Jacks we know what it feels to be welcomed and it was the opposite here.   There is a small bar in front of the restaurant which was packed and there is really no place to wait.  it really felt uncomfortable. If it had not been raining we would have left.  finally 10 minutes later we were shown to a beautiful table on the second floor.  It was a great table and the place is great for a date.  The first floor seems to be more for regulars and is more clubby.3.  The best part of our dinner was Duke our waiter.  He was friendly in a steak restaurant kind of way.  If it had been a french restuarant he might have been too familiar but for a steakhouse he was great.4.  I didn't realize that Club A was a restaurant week participant so I probably made the mistake by ordering from the cheaper menu.  I ordered a bottle of wine a argentianian Malbec which was $ 25 for the bottle.  An ok wine but a great price.  My husband doesn't drink-i had half the bottle and gave the rest to a young couple who sat next to us.5.  For apps we had the bacon and the steak tartare.  My husband liked both but i thought the bacon was very salty.  The steak tartare was fine.6.  They never brought bread.7.  For mains my husband had the hanger steak and I had the filet.  We ordered rare.  When the orders came they were cold through most of the steak.  The waiter asked that we cut it open to check so he must have known there might be an issue.  he took it back to be refired immediately.  Neither steak had a crust which is Steakhouse 101 guys.8 For the sides we had mac and cheese which i cleaned out it was really good.  the spinach with truffle oil was ok9.  Desert:  they gave us a happy birth day plate with cannoli, cream puffs and teramsu.  Nothing was good.The owner came around but he was robotic and not really engaged as described by others.  It's funny because we are the demographic of people who eat out often.,I would never go back...but obviously they don't need our business.",0,1,0,bonnie w.,"Manhattan, NY",6,70,35

5.0,1/30/2013,"We wanted to write a review for the owner of the restaurant as he was tremendously accommodating.  We were out for a semi-special occasion but ran late for our reservation that night, but the staff turned what was awkward into an amazing night.  Seeing that we were in a mess, they were kind enough to be able to seat us by a window seat with a view of the city streets and also genuinely helped us find the right parking.  The food has always been top notch with a extensive wine list...We would recommend the Filet Mignon and the Canadian bacon as dishes to try.  The owner and staff has made it a great place to take a romantic date and we certainly cannot wait to be there again.

4.0,1/30/2013,"Went for Restaurant Week with my husband and two friends.  We were running late but they were able to seat our friends who had arrived on time.Unlike some other places, the Restaurant Week menu is very extensive.  I ordered the steak tartare, filet mignon (rare), side of mac and cheese and the home made tiramisu.  The steak tartare and filet mignon were amazing, the mac and cheese was excellent and the tiramisu was good, but not spectacular.  I highly recommend getting any steak cut rare; they use very high quality beef and it's cooked and flavoured to perfection.  My husband got the filet mignon as medium rare; normally I'm a fan of medium rare but comparing his medium rare to my rare steak...well there was just no comparing - my steak won hands down!Service was good, but not great. They did check back consistently to make sure we were ok, but other than that, they were busy taking care of a full house so it wasn't anything amazing.  Servings are large; we asked for half our sides and desserts to be boxed, but only the desserts came back, seems like the sides got lost somewhere in the kitchen - I assume due to how busy they were, or it might have been that our waiter didn't understand.Overall it was a good dining experience.  I would come back, but only for the steak and have dessert elsewhere.UPDATE (30/01/2013 5 PM): Wow, talk about quick to respond to feedback.  I just received a call from Bruno, the owner, who personally apologised for the service not being top quality and then offered us the Restaurant Week menu for the next time we dine.  Now that's pretty amazing!",7,1,2,Deborah L.,"Manhattan, NY",62,69,10

4.0,1/27/2013,"My second time visiting and both service and food is still good! Ordered steak for 5, 24oz rib eye along with 3 sides--sautéed broccoli, garlic herb fries and the truffle  mac & cheese for our group of 6. Steak was prepared med. rare as requested. I personally preferred the rib eye because it was juicier than the porterhouse, but that's to be expected with the higher fat content. The porterhouse was still really good, but not the best I've had. Definitely get the mac & cheese if you don't mind truffle oil. It is delicious!! The broccoli, friess, and breadbasket were alright. Only down part was that we originally asked for bacon for our appetizer, but our order was accidentally left out.  However, our waiter came over and sincerely apologized twice and at the end of the meal we received complementary desserts and a full fruit platter. I believe we got all the desserts on the menu--cream puffs, tiramisu, carrot cake and cheese cake. The carrot cake and tiramisu was pretty good. Not a fan of cream puffs, but everyone else at the table enjoyed it. The cheese cake was standard. Pretty solid steakhouse and would return!",0,0,0,Jen L.,"Brooklyn, NY",38,29,1

The restaurant is well managed by a professional GM overseeing an attentive wait staff. I got a few slices of bacon and the double eagle bone-in.

There wasn't any real negatives, but there also was not an WOW factors. The service was ok, a little on the snooty side, rather than personable and warm. The food was strictly ok, and very typical steak house fare. It drives me nuts that they charge you for every plate and it adds up so quickly. The time of getting our main course was way too long I felt, about 25 minutes from when they took our appetizer until it came, so 40+ minutes since ordering. The filet mignon was good, the sides so so. The dessert, Tiramasa, AWFUL and DRY.  They did bring some complimentary cannolis that made up for it, but I don't think dessert is their forte.

The table next to us, one of the girls got the soup, apparently she made a face that looked like she had something less than satisfactory. The steak tartare was also pretty good but I think there were too many pickles. We got the hangar steak, and the filet mignon. OMG! It was amazing. I loved it. My girlfriend thinks Mastros is better for the filet mignon. She thought it didn't melt in your mouth and was a bit tough to cut. I loved both steaks. ;p I love it when my girl can't finish food when it is super good. Our sides were the truffle oil infused creamed spinach, and the mac and cheese. Both were super amazingly good. We were so full by the time we finished theres. It was weird though because we had a much bigger helping of the sides than other people but hey I'm not complaining!The desserts on the other hand were not that good.

5.0,1/21/2013,"Went here on 1/19 for a friend's birthday --- party of 8, just guys.  The decor is a little more suited for a romantic date, though.  Noticed that the vast majority of tables on the first floor were for 2 people.  If you have a larger party, consider booking the upstairs areas --- less dark, better for groups.Got two great red wine recommendations from the waiter.  My half of the table ordered the porterhouse for 4... which ended up being 2 porterhouses for two.  No matter --- the steak was absolutely delicious.  Ordered medium rare, the filet side was smooth and delicious.  Strip side was delicious as well, juicy without too much gristle.If you have a big appetite, I also recommend the Club A salad --- big chunks of tomato, chopped onions, thick bacon chunks, and shrimp.  For the life of me, I can't remember the sides we ordered... not because they were bad, but ... that wine was really good.And service was great.  We got to try the lobster ravioli on the house, the owner (or manager? I think his name was Bruno) got us extra shot of Petron, and we got a big plate of desserts to sample (a couple of cake slices, a few creampuffs) while our birthday boy got his own dessert.Delicious food, terrific service.  Prices are in line with other steakhouses (the porterhouse was $47 per person).  So it's not cheap, but worth every dollar.  Highly recommend for a special occasion.  Or really any occasion.

5.0,1/16/2013,"Club A was one of the best dining experiences I've ever had, period.  Now if that sounds like a stretch, hear me out.  - We called Club A at 8:30pm on a Saturday night and they were able to accomodate a 9:30 reservation.  That's awesome in it's own right.  When we got there, they seated us all the way upstairs in what is normally their Private Party room since they no longer had room in the normal dining area.  The Private room was AWESOME and there were only two other parties eating dinner in the room with us.- The staff was really on point.  They were friendly, prompt, and helpful.  Once the other two parties finished up their dinners and left, they allowed us to pretty much do whatever we want.  We turned on the big screen TV in the room to catch the tail end of the NFL playoff game that was on at the time, and stepped outside on the Private Room's balcony for a break mid-meal.- We were there to celebrate my friend and his sister's newfound US citizenship, as they had been naturalized earlier that day.  The staff was exceptionally hospitable regarding this fact.  The manager Bruno came over and spoke with us for a while, recounting his own experience with becoming a U.S. citizen.  They gave us a free sampling of delicious Lobster Ravioli between courses, gave us a free round of Black Label shots to celebrate (and took shots with us!), and as if that wasn't enough, gave us a free fruit salad and tray of cake for dessert.  Needless to say, Club A took care of us.- You know it's a good restaurant when you're 3 paragraphs into an online review before you even talk about how good the food was.  The appetizers were all fantastic (try the Steak Tartare and Lobster Ravioli!), the steaks we each ordered for our main course were AMAZING (I got the 24oz Ribeye), and the sides and dessert were equally delicious.  The Creamed Spinach finished with truffle oil is ridiculously good.  There wasn't one bad item that we tried on the menu.Very few restaurants deserve a 5/5 for both food AND service.  Club A is most definitely one of them.",1,1,1,Anthony M.,"Manhattan, NY",177,2,0

I also like that they treated us really great despite the fact that we went with a groupon. I've been to places where the attitude is a bit snobish if you go with a groupon- I'm assuming it is because they are assuming that you can't afford it if it's not with a discount. NEWS FLASH TO THOSE RESTAURANTS-- BIG MISTAKE ON YOUR PART!! Not only do you miss out on repeat business, you also miss out on patrons who, like us, usually tip over 20% for excellent service and food, and don't mind paying top dollar for these two elements. This is a new favorite for sure and we will be returning with or without a groupon!Only negative was the woman at the bar, hence the 4 stars, not 5. She was a bit aloof and not very friendly.

It was a tad salty but still some of the best I've had in a while.  The wine was standard, but a good deal for the price.For the main course, I got the hanger steak with truffled creamed spinach, she got the filet and fries.  The hanger steak was properly cooked to medium, pre sliced and served with a most excellent side sauce.  The steak was a tad chewy with some stringiness which afforded me more to savor this flavorful peace of meat.  The spinach was so creamy and delicious.  I tried some of the filet and it was what you expect from the most tender cut of meat.For dessert, we got cream puffs and tiramisu served with a birthday candle and ""happy birthday"" written in chocolate sauce.  I nice way to cap off the meal.  Both were good but not amazing.

Sides- Creamed Truffle spinach was SUPER YUM. Puree Potatoes were also SUPER YUM. SERVICE: VERY attentive. Probably because there were only about 10 tables but still very attentive. They did forget to bring my steak sauce and brought it out in the end when I finished my steak. I love the ambiance. It's so romantic actually with a rose and tall candle at every table. The second floor has ceiling to floor windows that's really nice. The room is all red with crystal chandeliers. They advertise that their private rooms there is no charge and no minimum to reserve. Would be great for a family or intimate gathering with your BFFs. I also like the fact that it's a family owned business.

5.0,1/8/2013,"Mmmmm what a fine piece of meat you are!  Yes, you ARE!  You wanna go on a trip?  To a place warm and juicy?!  Come into my mouth you piece of meat...there you go....::nom nom nom nom::Club A Steakhouse was on my hit list for a while, and having come here last year for Valentine's Day week, and then again for an annual friends Christmas dinner gift exchange, we weren't disappointed.  For a party of five, (no pun intended), we were seated in the basement - the wine cellar.  Perfectly intimate, quiet, and cozy, we were thrilled to be seated in the corner of the room.  Walls and ceiling were actually real wine boxes that they have happily emptied on prior guests, and wines are on diamond shaped racks, beckoning to you.  Piped in music played tunes of the season, and the decor was simple, clean and crisp.  I was at first wishing we were seated upstairs in main dining, but then realized this was a much better atmosphere for all of us; we could talk without screaming to each other and have wonderful private moments that a camera couldn't provide.We got some appetizers to start, such as the lump crab meat, tuna tartar (the night's special), crab cakes, and steak tartar.  Appetizers are reasonably priced for the portion, the presentation, and taste; they all were stellar and would highly recommend the tuna tartar and the lump crab meat - divine!The main event, we got two meat platters for two - I'm talking sausage, different cuts of steak,...it's just mouth watering!  I was barely able to finish this with my gal pal because the apps were totally filling; however, we did finish the bottle of wine that was compliments of the house!  I had showed that I had a prior Yelp deal that expired, but was good for $80 credit, so in addition to applying the credit to the meal, the wine was free.  I even kept the wine cork!Service is absolutely nothing short of amazing.  Helpful wait staff to best accommodate what we were looking for in a wine, and even opened more than one bottle to help us better decide.  How many places take that much time investing in their returning customers?? Not many sadly.Club A moving forward will be a tradition I'm sure, and more than just for the holidays.",2,3,2,Jaclyn C.,"Brooklyn, NY",1216,896,1227
5.0,1/7/2013,"So I went back to Club A this past friday after scoring another Groupon deal. Thank goodness for Groupon b/c it helped confirm that I am indeed in love w/ Club A Steakhouse. From the minute we stepped inside where we were greeted by a lovely hostess, and then brought to our table right in front of the fireplace (as was requested and so kindly met) by Bruno- the owner, we were again in love. The downstairs room in which we were sat was a beautiful red, with many black and whites on the walls and a warm fireplace at the end. It reminded me of Strip House but better!Overall, the service was great. Our waiter was attentive, friendly and courteous, and everyone that brought our food or serviced us in other ways was extremely professional and personable. The food (2 filet mignons - 1 medium rare and 1 medium, mac & cheese, garlic fries, bacon and calamari) were all extremely good, and we were both happy that our steaks were cooked to perfection. Being a steak lover, there's nothing more annoying than ordering a medium rare steak only to get it medium. At Club A Steakhouse, though, they did it just right.After this second visit, I believe that this will now be our go-to steakhouse. It's classy, tasty, friendly, warm, not too loud, and everything else that I could want when I want a nice, intimate steak dinner. Bonus points to for them allowing you to bring your own bottle! They have a nice selection of wine, but since the hubby and I have grown quite the collection of nice wines, we figured we'd bring our own and make it feel that much more special.Thanks Club A for a wonderful friday night and for being everything that we could ask for.",12,6,9,Nerissa I.,"New York, NY",181,151,121

1.0,1/5/2013,"We visited Club A last night for the first time for my husband's birthday. While the Club A salad and the steaks were excellent, the service was terrible. I had called ahead and requested a table in the second floor front room near the window. The hostess had us wait near the top of the stairs, assuring us that our table would be available shortly. After several minutes, the manager began to lead us to a back room table. When we inquired about the table the hostess had us waiting for, he coldly replied, ""They're not moving,"" with no further apology. Next, there was confusion about who our waiter would be: one server began to speak to us only to be interrupted and replaced a moment later by another. When our salads arrived, brought by another server, he did not know who ordered which dish. (We were at a table for two.) Then, instead of bringing the steak knives (and a second fork which I requested) before the steaks, the server brought the steaks first, left them (to get cold), and then returned with the silverware and, eventually, the side dishes. The special steak sauces were never mentioned; the sauce that was brought tasted like ketchup, which a previous reviewer noted.  Finally, despite the fact that I mentioned my husband's birthday when I called ahead and reminded the hostess as we were being escorted upstairs, it was not clear that the servers were aware of it. I then discreetly reminded the waiter when he brought the dessert we ordered; once more, a different server brought out a special dessert (which was nice) and asked whose birthday it was.  I also needed to remind the servers about the salad dressing (twice) and sugar/sweet and low (which for some reason were not brought with my coffee). The manager passed by our table many times during the meal, but never once inquired about our dinner or the service. We wonder if this poor treatment was due to the fact that we made reservations through Savored or the fact that we did not order alcohol. In choosing Club A, after reading many fine reviews, we had hoped it would be a restaurant we could visit periodically with friends.  However, we'll never return due to such poor service and management.",1,0,0,Arlene B.,"New York, NY",0,2,0

I also loved the fact that the owner (I think?) came out and paid a visit to the tables to see how his customers were doing! That one little thing makes a customer's experience all the better. Food presentation was awesome. They cut your food and let you take pictures, too. When your wine glass is low, they'll come to refill you. We ordered the Porterhouse for four and it was plenty of food for all of us. It was really good! Pricing isn't so bad either, I would say it is worth it. If you're a mac n cheese fan, you MUST try their mac n cheese it's soooo good!!!They even have a live band performing.

Luckily that night we came (1st night of the Christmas tree lighting) it wasn't busy that we walked right in. I love how the ambiance is dark and sexy, also that the host would take your coat for you. It was a huge restaurant with a upstairs and downstairs. Service is top notch from the waiters to the busers constantly asking us if we needed anything, how our food was, recommendations, our waters were always filled and our food came out perfect timing.I got the Chilean sea bass and the truffle mac and cheese and the boyfriend got the rib eye steak with a huge loaded baked potato. We also ordered a glass of moscato wine for me and beer for him. I love the bread basket they serve! Different types of bread but my fave has got to be the onion with black sesame seeds...it was so good that I asked them to bring me another basket. The sea bass has got to be the best I've had in my life..literally it's like butter, melt in your mouth! The mac and cheese was delish and so was the baked potato. The bf also said the steak was fine cut. The price here is expensive but worth the price with the quantity and quality of the food plus the superb service and atmosphere.

5.0,1/2/2013,"I have been here many times and I am not a typical 'write a review' kind of person but I have to say that this is just a great place.  The last visit was on December 18th with all the staff of our business - 15 people. The steaks are really exceptional and I've been to almost every top steak house in New York to compare them to.  The last time we went with 15 people and everyone loved everything we had so we returned again.  Most of the people were real 'foodies' and have been to all the top steak houses as well.  The owner is on hand to oversee every detail and dining here is much more intimate affair even with a large party of people.  It is much more like being in someone's home or personal presence rather than a big 'steak mill' kind of place. The owner remembers his diners and remembers what you like.  The greeting is genuine and personal and not just 'another customer'.  We take our staff out for celebrations pretty often and have tried many steak houses and the consistent consensus is to return to Club A Steak.The service staff are great.  Very natural and professional.  They adapt to the mood of the diners in the most appropriate way and know their business.The wine list is great and there are many reasonably priced wines that are exceptional.I have been here on dates and small business dinners and large parties.  All the food is consistent and really 'spot-on' all the time - whether for 2 people or 15 people.There is not much more that one can ask for in a Steak House. I have a lot of 'pet peeves' about dining in New York - principal among them is arriving for a reservation and having to wait 20 or 30 minutes for the reservation time to be honored - this is so common in big steak houses.But at Club A Steak - it is never the case as it is the diner / customer that is most important and not the business first.For me, its really one of the very best Steak House experiences in New York.",0,0,0,Ron B.,"Manhattan, NY",3,1,0

5.0,12/29/2012,"What a fantastic steakhouse in East Midtown!  I came here with my best friend and decided to dine here for our first dinner based on their stellar Yelp reviews.  Let me say, they exceeded our expectations.  The moment you walk in, the dim lighting, the deep rich velvet red interior and bar sets the mood.  We made reservations for 8:30pm and were immediately seated.  The place although large is packed tightly.  There are tables that overlook the streets and the Christmas lights on the trees combined with the outside snow really helps set a fine intimate space for you and your company.  The rose, candle light, red velvet walls and ceiling and dark wood makes this place very romantic and just the perfect place to bring a date.The food overall was excellent, better yet exceptional. In fact we both had the best steak we ever had tonight.  We started off with the half dozen oyster appetizer.  The oysters were huge and it came with three sauces.  One was your cocktail sauce, a chili infused oil, and a spicy horseradish sauce and yes it had some kick!  Everything was lovely and fresh as you'd expect.  We also ordered the porterhouse steak for two which was the most tastiest and moist steak I've ever had. The steak was very well seasoned with the outside charred perfectly while being medium rare in the middle.  It came presented still sizzling on the iron skillet and pre-cut ready for us to devour all that meaty juicy goodness! Oh man did we get a treat and some.  The portion size is very generous.  So much so that we couldn't finish our steak!  We also ordered a side of the Yukon potato purée and the truffle Mac n' cheese.  Both were excellent.  The Yukon potato purée was creamy, smooth and buttery.  Just fantastic!  The truffle Mac n' cheese was also wonderful.  There was a light hint of truffle that I tasted in the Mac n' cheese.  It wasn't too heavy, it was creamy, smooth and light despite being a pasta dish.Our waiter surprised us with two additional side dishes to try out on the house!  Yes, we weren't charged for these dishes which runs $9 to $10 each!  The creamy spinach was flavorful and rich and we also were given brussel sprouts cooked with pork belly.  Wholly cow, this was taaaasty!  We managed to eat close to everything but we did find room to order the cheese cake.  The cheesecake was rich yet light and the whip cream with a sprig of mint was a perfect accompaniment to this wonderful dessert.  I do have to say, this was very sweet so if you have issues with super sweet deserts, I probably recommend choosing an  alternative dessert.Our waiter was awesome!  What can I say, I never had a waiter so attentive to detail and thoughtful to being to us such an exceptional experience.  The staff here display exceptional care, attention to details, and teamwork to a level seldom seen in even the finest restaurants.  I also found it very classy that the owner of the restaurant took the time to greet us as well as other neighboring diners to ask them about their experience and to thank them for dining at his restaurant.  Overall, I highly recommend this restaurant not only for the stellar quality of their food but for an exceptional dining experience that you'll remember forever.",2,0,0,Tet W.,"Portland, OR",44,230,93

5.0,12/17/2012,"Ate here for dinner during my first night in New York this past weekend.  Our group hadn't planned to eat here, but man were we glad we found this spot!  After all, you can't go to New York and not have some steak right?We didn't book a reservation until the day of so all we could find was either 5pm or 9:30pm for a party of 5.  We opted for the 5pm time (so we could go drinking later at night of course).When we arrived, the staff was friendly and nice, checking our coats right away.  It was somewhat empty at the time, but then again it was only 5pm.  (The place quickly got crowded over the time we were there).  The place is definitely fancy and would probably be perfect for a date or intimate setting.  It's definitely one of those places where you feel weird if you take pictures of your food before eating haha.  I also noticed there are tons of servers around.  This probably helps give each table a lot more attention.  Side story: there was one point we were joking about how bad the steak was, and one of the servers standing near us was instantly on it in asking us how they could better the situation... now that's service!The prices are what you would expect for a mid to high end steakhouse, fetching about $40 a steak.  I shared two steaks with two other people while the table shared 5 side dishes across the whole table.  The staff was kind enough to divide our sides evenly amongst each person.  For our sides, we got the broccoli, fries, mushrooms, calamari, and macaroni and cheese.  The clear winner was definitely the mushrooms for all of us at the table.  It's one of those dishes where you must figure that it's due to tons and tons of butter just perfectly utilized.  The other dishes are as good as what you would expect from a steakhouse like this.The steaks I shared with two others were the prime rib and ribeye.  The prime rib was really good, cooked to perfection, but man the ribeye was pure perfection.  Really melts in your mouth good is how juicy and amazing it is.  And even though we shared so many different things, steaks included, we were all more than full and satisfied with how much and what we ate.  The owner made sure to ask us about our experience when we left being the good host that he should be, and we let him know it was great.I'm always looking for a great steakhouse, and this place certainly did not disappoint.  I'm glad I was able to find a memorable steak experience from New York.",1,0,0,Travis D.,"Santa Ana, CA",450,53,26

I was sort of cold so I kept my jacket on and without a word said to anyone, a random server came over and adjusted the AC so it would not point in my direction. The food is well prepared. Appetizers- Their Caesar salad was the best salad I have ever had in my life! The calamari was good. (Def going back to try the bacon tho because I def want to try it!)Entree- The Filet Mignon was good. Well cooked on the outside while prepared medium as I requested on the inside! The brook trout was refreshing. Sides- The spinach and mash potatoes which were huge portions!!! I wasn't a fan of the spinach tho because I realize can't stomach truffle sauce.

After some behind the coat check deliberation I was seated..I was all prepared for a experience that mirrored those of restaurant week..you know fast in fast out, no hospitality you minion! Boy was I wrong!! Never mind the fact that the Yelp certificate was a great deal, but 1/3 of the restaurant also had deals, along with the rest of the crowd that DIDNT have a certificate all received the 5 star treatment! Me and my companion received hors d'oerves on the house, met the Manager, and extra appetizers, and that was BEFORE the main dish! The crowd was great, unpretentious and just down and out awesome. the wine in the fancy decanter WILL make you go and cop another bottle just for the shyts and giggles! The steak was very good paired with my cabernet, and the Love was neverending. The shrimp was great according to my home girl, and the love was endless. It gets tight in there, that must be a good thing then, means its popular.

When we arrived, we were quickly seated at a beautiful table by the window. It is just before Christmas - the restaurant was decorated beautifully, complete with a Christmas wreath on the window, a decorated tree right outside the window, and a lovely poinsettia on the table. Ambiance was romanic yet festive. We ordered drinks and some salads (salad was good, not too much dressing). Next we ordered a main course with a bottle of wine. The wine was great (recommendation of the server) and the steaks were wonderful!! Sides of whipped yukon potato puree and sautéed asparagus were excellent compliments to the steak (Filet Mignon and Prime Dry Aged Rib Eye - both great). Our server (or servers - a couple worked together to make a wonderful experience) was excellent! After dinner my boyfriend proposed!! It was a beautiful setting and everyone applauded us. The owner, Bruno, came over to our table and congratulated us very soon after (with giving us plenty of time to enjoy the moment with each other). He told us he has been happily married to his wife for 37 years and sent his congratulations. Our server brought us a dessert tray with ""congratulations"" written on it and glasses of champaign to toast the event. Club A Steakhouse provided THE PERFECT setting for our engagement, we are so happy to share this moment in our lives at this restaurant and will return for sure. As we were leaving, Bruno offered us a drink at his bar. He was wonderful, celebrated with us, and even brought me a rose for the occasion!

I made a call on the day of requesting that we get the best seats in the house since I wanted to make my husband's birthday extra special. We arrived at the restaurant at 5:30pm and sadly, the live jazz music was unavailable as we assumed that it was because we were early. We did expect the music to start somewhere around 6:00/6:30pm--but no live jazz that Saturday night, sad, but heard some CD-played jazz music--boo!We ended up sitting on the top floor right by the window---beautiful! The lights and the view made the night extra special, and I was happy that they were able to meet this request. We ordered: Classic Caesar with shaved parmesan to share; Filet Mignon (my husband); and Hanger Steak for myself. I was somewhat satisfied with my steak although it was not as flavorful or tasty as I had expected it to be--and my husband was not happy with his steak as it was EXTREMELY well-done (he had asked for well-done...) to the point that it was hard for him to chew and savor the meat. He had thought about returning the meat; however, he decided to be ""nice"" about it.   For our side dishes, we got: German Style Hash Brown; Creamed Spinach; and 5 Cheeses Truffle ""Mac"". The ""Mac"" was actually too heavy for both of us and the Creamed Spinach had an interesting after-taste that was too strong for my taste-buds. Boo, for the food in general. I did appreciate the owner coming back our table and greeting us and was thankful for the birthday platter. The birthday platter looked great in terms of presentation;  however, as I noted above--it lacked in flavor (and trust me, I've had MANY yummy desserts...). Will we come back? Hmm, I'm not sure. We may just stick with our usual, Ruth Chris' or Peter Luger despite the price. Side Note: If you sign up for email on their website, you'll receive $15 off coupon for your visit.

In fact, whenever I'm in a steakhouse without him, I feel weird and fear that the meal will not be good (*cough* Les Halles *cough*). That night, it was blustery and N just got out of work and did not feel like dressing up while I was just getting over the flu and looked like a day patient on release from nearby Bellevue hospital. I did not expect them to treat us well- c'mon we all know plenty of these places put a premium on your appearance because it's the outside gauge of how much you are going to spend. We went inside and the Maitre'd didn't even bat an eyelash. He greeted us warmly, took our coats, and ushered us to our table. A waiter was over in less than 5 seconds and took our drink orders. He came back with red wine in a very cool looking snake decanter. Tally = 1 star for the maitre d + 1 star for the decanter. 2 stars and dinner hasn't even started yet.After we placed our orders, we were surprised when one of the 3 waiters buzzing around our table brought over shrimp cocktails. I was quick to point out that we didn't order it- turns out it was on the house. Free food? Hellz yeah. N and I started digging into the plate and when I looked up, another waiter was there with another dish on his hands. 2nd comped app of the night - a potato dish with melted cheese and asparagus. At that point, I was running out of stars to dispense. N and I were grinning like cheshire cats and toasting our good fortune ..... and the maitre'd came over with truffle mac and cheese. Free.

That's right ... big smile.Me: My face hurts.Entrees time! They brought over our yummy cuts of meat ... with several other yummy cuts of meat topped with bacon strips (free, of course). I was ready to give them 10 stars at this point. As the meal was nearing its end, a waiter comes out with a portable stove on a rolling cart, parks right at our table, and prepares a flambe of assorted fruit and cream. I always make room for dessert so I said to N: ""I got this, dude, no worries.""

We were treated very differently from those around us who did not have a Groupon - to the point that the manager actually came around and asked every table around us how their meal was - every table EXCEPT for ours. He could have made it a bit less obvious.As for our waiter, it was like he was asleep at the wheel - I have to say that it didn't seem like anything personal. But it took 10 minutes for any of the waitstaff to even acknowledge that we were at the table and bring us even a wine list. Our waiter forgot which side dishes we ordered, next - brought me the wrong salad, after that, had my steak overdone (we didn't send it back because we were too hungry to wait for another one). Our waiter also failed to mention the sauces available with our filet - so I guess we got the special house sauce - which tasted like ketchup. Unbelievably bad. We asked another waiter if there was anything else, even worcestershire, that he could offer us and he said there were a bunch of other sauces available which our waiter hadn't even told us about.We had eaten here before - about a year back and our service was vastly different - manager and all. But I guess at that time, they didn't have all the positive Yelp reviews yet and actually cared, even for those with 'coupons.'

Sat upstairs which the host said ""was more romantic"", it was quieter and quiet lovely-although they really went hard with the red velvet and red roses.Had the Canadian Bacon and clams to start. The Bacon is excellent-it comes with their steak sauce which is a way better version of ketchup. For our entree we split Prime Dry Aged Porterhouse Steak for 2 and we were not disappointed. It was cooked perfectly. They gave us creamed truffle spinach on the house which was light and delicious.We were full, but they brought out tirimisu and cream puffs on the house and we couldn't say no.My one complaint was the service was a little faster than I would have hoped. One course came out right after the next. Shared wine and got a discount on that because we found a coupon on their website.",0,0,0,Bee C.,"Brooklyn, NY",2,382,0

Its is a really nice setting (both on a date or otherwise).Best NY Strip I've ever had (got the bone-in). I've also been to Delmonico's in NY, Manny's in MN (used to be top 10 in the country), and Murray's in MN. GF was very happy with her filet.Both steaks were huge. We actually had to take big doggy bags.A bunch of complimentary items- this is a great idea as I wouldn't usually get desert but now I can recommend it and I would get it next time!Bruno spoke with us multiple times to make sure we were doing great. Very attentive. Wait staff was perfect. Did not rush us one bit. When I was at Delmonico's I felt out of place and that someone was constantly watching me eat/talk. At Club A, you get space and time! Maybe the wait staff realized we weren't in a rush and therefore waited on us as they saw fit? Who knows...Though I am also not one of those people that complain I need my meal 10 minutes after I ordered, complain I have to ask for water, or that I need the check as soon as I am done eating.....I don't see what the big deal is about raising your hand to get something....This is a nice place, people, take your time and enjoy it!Anyway, definitely going back, definitely recommend it.",0,0,0,Michael M.,"Hoboken, NJ",54,132,34

4.0,11/1/2012,"Dinner for two on a Thursday evening, in the wake of Hurricane Sandy. I know we would be running late so I called to move the reservation back 30min. Hostess was very friendly & understanding, so that had us off to a good start. Food was fine: I had the filet mignon, my friend had the New York strip steak, both were done right, although both also dried out really, really quickly, rendering the last third of our steaks too dry to finish. The au poivre sauce provided was scant. A more generous portion could have helped remedy the dry steak situation. Overall, they do well for being a steak house. The sides - creamed spinach and potato puree - were decadently delicious (because a ton of butter sure makes it better!). Ambience: The interior is swathed in bold reds, dimly-lit, with a rose and candle on each table. Honestly I felt rather embarrassed by the cliched ""romance"" they were trying to create. The best thing going for Club A's upstairs dining room is that there is a tree covered in dainty lights outside the window, effusing the space with much-needed lightness and effervescence.  Service: Unfortunately, we had a server that seemed disoriented and confused. After giving us waters, we sat there waiting as neither menu or wine list manifested itself. A good 10 minutes passed until bread appeared on our tables, at which time, we still had neither menu nor wine list. Finally, someone else came by and basically took over our table. The table beside us also had the same dismal service. I don't know if there was confusion over whose section we belonged in, or the server could have had a hard time getting to work due to the hurricane / dealing with a personal tragedy etc., so I'm only taking away 1 star.

3.0,10/25/2012,"Upon walking into the restaurant you'll notice immediately that the decor is a bit outdated.  I wouldn't try to impress a date by taking him/her here, nor would I do a GNO at this overwhelmingly RED restaurant.  It's great for a family outing on an empty stomach. There's no need to dress up here - it's a tad bit above casual.Despite arriving 30 min early for our reservation and 1 party short, they were kind enough to seat us regardless.  But for a party of 6, our table was a bit  too large for intimate conversations, and sharing dishes - it made for awkward reaches that kept me from more helpings (which may be a good thing).  Service was okay.  I was annoyed with the fact that when I had asked the server if an 8 oz filet mignon was available, he offered the 10 oz ""petite"" but failed to mention that it was only $3 less than the regular 16 oz filet mignon.  We ordered 3 of them...I didn't even finish mine. We could've shared.  We knew his intentions : party of 6 = gratuity included = $$$.  I was even more annoyed that after we paid the hefty bill, it took 3 waiters to get brown sugar for the espresso - the espresso that everyone else finished and T had to down when the sugar finally arrived. Food overall was okay. Great if you're the meat and potato type.Lobster Ravioli - Nice complimentary sample. It was quite good and made me wish I had ordered this instead.Petite Filet Mignon 10oz - For $3 more you might as well order the full 16 oz.  and take the rest home for a steak sandwich for lunch the next day. Of course they didn't inform me until we got the bill.  Despite my disappointment (of feeling ripped off), my medium rare was perfect.  One Pound Baked Potato - Way too heavy. Nothing special. Just plain baked potato and sour cream.Whipped Yukon Potato Puree - Again, nothing special. 5 Cheeses Truffle Mac - This was good (I think), but I've had better.  Onion Rings - Good.Creamed Spinach - Not my favorite.Food coma.

5.0,10/21/2012,"Love, love, loved this place! It was better than I could have imagined. I took the fiance here for his birthday dinner hoping for a restaurant that would be fancy and romantic without skimping on portions. I made the reservation a couple months in advance to be sure that I got the date and time that I wanted. The steakhouse is tucked away on a quiet street in the upper east side; the outside is low-key and beautifully lit. The inside of the restaurant was beautiful and luxurious, primarily done in hues of dark red. Our table was a booth on the second floor. I loved everything about our table, from the plush velvet seats to the tall, flickering candle and the single red rose on the tabletop. The noise level in the restaurant was very quiet despite there being a lot of people there.We started our meal with a bread basket that contained a variety of different breads and crackers, along with a tub of fresh-tasting butter. Our server brought out complimentary lobster ravioli for us to eat before our entrees came out. It was delicious and perfectly cooked, with big chunks of meat on the inside and covered in a buttery sauce. We ended up ordering two glasses of champagne, the meat plate for two (filet mignon, sweet and spicy sausage, veal, and lamb chops), and sides of truffle mac & cheese, sauteed asparagus, and rosemary garlic fries. We were absolutely stuffed before we were anywhere close to finished with our meal. We took home three containers full of leftovers, and the servers were really nice about it. The meat was incredible: tender and juicy and full of flavor. The filet mignon and the lamb chops were the best; the plate of meat could have easily fed 3 or 4 people. The truffle mac and cheese was full of flavor with a distinct truffle undertone. I can't say anything bad about any of the food we were served.At the end of our meal we were served the complimentary birthday platter, which came with cannoli's, cream puffs, a slice of tiramisu, and two more glasses of champagne. The dessert was beautifully presented, despite us not being able to fit much of it into our stomachs. The tiramisu was the best I've ever had.The meal was a splurge, yes, but completely worth it for a special occasion.

They then gave us a choice between upstairs or downstairs seating.  We chose upstairs, but you really can't go wrong - the décor on both floors is great.  The food was amazing, the service was fantastic, and they brought out a birthday dessert platter - complimentary - at the end of the meal.  A great dining experience!",0,0,0,Lindsay N.,"Manhattan, NY",1,4,0

I purchased a Groupon deal (an excellent 4 courses for ~$40pp), hoping/praying we wouldn't be treated the way many restaurants do during Restaurant Week - you know the deal: poor seating, a 'wish you weren't here' attitude from the waitstaff, etc.  But at Club A, I couldn't help but crack a wide smile when the maitre d' softly asked to see my groupon code and then waited patiently as my phone slowly loaded it up. Point, steakhouse.Onto the seating, in a casual, cozy room, with burning fireplace. I was intrigued with the slow burning tall candle, wondering if it drips down over the course of the meal to various lengths to indicate things to the staff. Probably not, just pontificating ;)  Our waiter, a bearded gentleman, was warm, friendly, and happy to assist. We asked a few questions and got some pointed recommendations. In fact we were so content with the meal, we could hardly touch the desserts. Speaking of the food: I had the footlong, inch-thick, canadian bacon slab, creamed spinach, 10 oz filet (cooked rare with charred edges), and puff tarts.

4.0,10/12/2012,"I used to believe a steakhouse is a steakhouse, and when you've seen one, you've seen them all.  This is still somewhat true, but I'm starting to pick out some of the key differentiators among the big names in town.  Club A was recommended to me by an expert for Tom's birthday: It was between Luger, Wolfgang's, Club A, or Del Frisco - so I went for the one I'd never heard of or visited before.  The lobby is so old school.  Red decor & wood, with a bassist and loungey singer standing above the tables.  It's an older clientele, a classic vibe, lacking some of the polish and trend of Quality Meats or Strip House.  We're going for 1930s authenticity rather than what I'd consider ""sexy.""  The host was prompt, and brought us right upstairs to a nice two-top a little further away from other diners - this I appreciated.  Hate sitting on top of other people or having them overhear your conversation.  Outside, holiday lights lit the trees at window level, which created a beautiful effect.Our waiter was top-notch.  Really giving it his all - he was EXTREMELY attentive, and intuitive - catching eye signals and delivering courses in perfect cadence.  And, as it was a birthday, we went all out.  Caesar Salad - a little wetter than I like, but garlicky, so I loved it.  The same Canadian Bacon that they serve at Luger - ridiculous, absurdly thick, almost scary, but if you're a carnivore, you'll be all over it.  Filet was filet - not the best I've ever had, but cooked as per instructions and satisfying enough.  Sides - killer.  Truffled mac & cheese, truffled creamed spinach - overload.  So good.  Brussels Sprouts with prosciutto and parmesan - augh, super-soft.  The sides always end up being my favorite part....and Cream Puffs / Tiramisu for dessert.  Wish I'd been able to try more than a bite of the cream puffs, but I was absolutely rolling by that point.The waiter also recommended an excellent pinot noir, and their dirty martinis are filthy, and just as strong as you'd expect.  Club A wasn't full of surprises by any means - it was pretty typical - but they hit all key points.  They set out on a mission to be a lovely, classic Manhattan steakhouse - and achieved it.  Had a great night.",1,0,2,Emily R.,"Manhattan, NY",452,361,4

Upstairs is brighter, quieter, and seemed to have older diners. Just FYI.We started by sharing a seafood platter. Lobster, shrimp, crab meat. Pretty decent.I actually wasn't in a steak mood so I opted for the lobster ravioli. It wasn't good unfortunately. The flavors were bland and the texture was similar to what you could get at a supermarket and then boil yourself.I tried a few slices of my friends bone-in ribeye. It was excellent. Probably should have gone with the steak.Truffle oil mac and cheese was fantastic although VERY heavy and overpowering.

For the entree, we had the Pinot Noir Braised Short Ribs Osso Bucco style and Prime NY Strip. I love Short Ribs and I usually have osso bucco lamb shank so this was definitely my favorite dish! It was so tender, that the meat just fell off the bone and the sauce/gravy was melt-in-your-mouth delicious. The NY Strip steak was cooked just right and was just as tender as the short ribs.

4.0,10/1/2012,"Summary:Food = 5 starsWait Staff = 3 stars (very slow and not very attentive)Overall experience = 4 starsPrice = 5 stars (this is not a ""value"" restaurant but I thought the price matched the quality and quantity of food provided.Atmosphere was quiet and simple.  A nice place to sit and talk with other people at the table.  When we arrived we were greeted by the owner and provided an option related to where we wanted to sit.  We chose the upstairs dining area and had a nice view out of their second story windows.  Light music was playing in the back ground but it was at the perfect volume.  Not so loud that you couldn't converse at the table but not so quiet that you couldn't hear it.  The service had a very European feel (we were there from 8:30 until midnight and didn't even order dessert) and the servers were a bit slow (we had to remind them twice to get us refills on our drinks) but they were very kind and knowledgeable with regards to the menu.  The food was fantastic!  We ordered the fillet and salmon, asparagus, five cheese mac and cheese, and mashed potatoes. Everything was delicious. I would recommend this restaurant for those who are looking for a relaxing evening in a restaurant.  However, if you are looking to eat and then do something else I would recommend letting the wait staff know in advance and/or selecting a different restaurant.",0,0,0,Spencer R.,"Keller, TX",6,47,3
4.0,10/1/2012,"Had a rocky start, I called about an hour before and made a reservation over the phone, sure enough when we shop up, there are no reseravations under my name so we enede up waiting for 20 minutes. I gave them bit of attitude because hostess was not most accomodating, she did not ever offer to sit at the bar while we wait or she could have brought two drinks, o well what ever.Now to the food, well that was well worth the 20 minute wait. Order 18 oz steak with side 1lb potato and asparagus, also ordered chianti to pair it with the meat. Boys and Girls this was excellent meal, steak was done just the right way, side were excellent. At the end of the meal they brought complementary desert platter which had a tiramissu, a puff and cannoli, I did not care for desert but I think only because I was stuffed from my meal. Mind that we did not order any starters. My huband thought desert was excellent and he doesn't care about desers so I am going to take his word for it. The place was full so waiters were hustling but he did check at least twice if needed anything or if everything was good. Bus biys brought water alll the time. We had very cozy corner table on second floor and it offers wonderfull view to outside, very romantic. There are candles on each table and red roses, over all decor is heavy red, kind of old school.One thing that I would fix is the bathroom, that was by far the dirties bathroom is high end place, no toilet paper just a mess.Other then the bathroom and snotty hostess I would come back for the food and do recommened eating here.",1,0,0,Regina D.,"Forest Hills, NY",8,119,1

It isn't long, but it has what you should want. We enjoyed two amazing Brunellos. Presentation and decanter were delightful.The food...the food! I am still dreaming about the Canadian bacon appetizer. If I could order a wedge salad with five slices of the Canadian bacon on it for dinner, I would. Also had the onion soup, covered with gruyere - delish. I ordered a special; that day they were offering Porterhouse for one. Except it was still big enough for two, at least! Cooked to a medium-rare turn. All that I have come to expect from Peter Luger and MORE. WTG, Club A. I highly recommend the Club A steak sauce. Sides were sauteed broccoli (yum), onion straws (solid), and truffle mac (not recommended). Nothing really wrong with the truffle mac...it was just, shall we say, uninspired? Needed more flavor. I'd try a different side next time...or get more Canadian bacon with the entree. No, seriously. MORE. CANADIAN. BACON.The highly attentive staff knew it was our first time at Club A and made the experience all the better. They even brought a complimentary, massive fruit plate and coffees for us...we were so stuffed it was laughable. Best part, I get the feeling they treat everyone this well, first-timers or not.Oh - and the entertainment - on a Saturday night - there was a two-person jazz combo. Nice, low-key music that just augmented the ambience nicely. I loved hearing a mix of old standards and some unexpected stuff, as well.

4.0,9/26/2012,"Ate at Club A for the first time because I had a Living Social deal, which was for a pre-fixe menu. First off, the restaurant has NO dress code, so if you think this is going to be your run of the mill fancy steakhouse ... you're wrong! Although it looks fancy, there were patrons at the restaurant surprisingly in sneakers and t-shirts. The  restaurant is dimly lit like any other steakhouse, but the noise level was quite high. I was actually surprised at how loud everyone was and it sort of distorted the intimacy of the spot.For the food, I ordered the hangar steak, medium rare, and my other half ordered the filet mignon, also medium rare. The hangar steak was a tad chewy and wasn't as soft and tender as I would have liked. As for the filet, it was perfect! Soft, easy to chew and cooked to perfection. We also ordered 2 sides, mac and cheese and the spinach. I absolutely loved the sides! Nothing to complain about. The spinach was very creamy and delicious.In summary, I did like that there was some noise at the restaurant, but it was a bit over the level I expected. It's semi-romantic b/c it is still dimly lit, but if you want an extremely quiet romantic (you have to whisper) restaurant this might not be your spot. The food is still GREAT though and even though it's not the best steakhouse I've been to, it's still an excellent choice for a fancy dinner!",0,0,1,Chris E.,"Brooklyn, NY",530,1118,9624
1.0,9/25/2012,"I went to Club A Steakhouse last night and had reservations for 2 @ 9:30PM and the short of it is --- I don't plan on going back and I do not recommend this place! I'd much rather spend a little more to go to Wolfgang's or Del Frisco's or any other NYC steakhouse! Overall, the wait time was longer than expected at every point in the meal, my steak was not seasoned and COMPLETELY overcooked - to the point where about 1/3 was simply inedible (charred and dried meat bits flaking off the edges) and to top it off, no one came by to check on our meal nor was anyone available to even complain about the absolutely overcooked steak. My boyfriend and I got there early but we were seated 15-20 minutes past our reservation time. Fine, they are busy... We had a Living Social deal and it took a while between each of the 3 courses for food to come out. Again, busy night - fine. The worst part was the fact that both our filets were totally overcooked. I ordered mine Med-Rare and my boyfriend's was ordered as Medium. After a fairly long wait, our steaks finally arrived and we were completely disappointed. Both of ours were Med-well at best and completely under-seasoned. Also the filets definitely didn't look like 10 ounces but the absolute cherry on top was that mine was so charred and so overcooked that with the exception of the very center part, it was virtually inedible. I was starving and tried to eat more but it was so chewy and just tasted bitter & burnt. No one came by to check on us and it was extremely frustrating. I really couldn't even get anyone's attention and I really didn't want to wait another 30 minutes for another overcooked and under-seasoned steak so I gave up and ate what I could, which wasn't much.   By way of a busboy to whom I complained when he was taking my plate - I finally spoke to the waiter after the meal was over (close to 11PM BTW... due to various lengthy wait times). The waiter didn't come back for a while and when our desserts came out, we were given 2 tiny cannoli.. The waiter came back and offered a free drink on the house. On a work night, that late, I wasn't going to start drinking so I politely refused the drink. At the end of the night - we asked for the check (also took forever even though we had no plates or drinks in front of us no one cared to come by) and we were told not to worry about it...Thing is, we used a Living Social voucher, which means that we had already paid for the meal. So, telling me ""don't worry about it"" just means - don't leave a tip...  I wasn't going to not tip, so we left a tip and left. Thanks Club A for the sub-par experience from beginning to end. What a total disappointment... I will not be going back and highly recommend going to pretty much any other NYC steakhouse but this one.",0,0,0,Jen K.,"New York, NY",0,8,1
5.0,9/25/2012,"I know saying ""it doesn't get any better than this"" sounds extreme, but Club A was just that amazing! Like many others, we went last night with a livingsocial deal which I'd been waiting to use on my birthday. As soon as we walked in, we were enchanted by the romantic decor and professional yet friendly host. We were quickly seated upstairs, a beautiful area with floor to ceiling windows looking out at tree tops covered in twinkling white lights. As part of the deal, we ordered from a prix fixe menu which offered more options than most. My girlfriend opted for the filet mignon which was perfectly cooked and delicious. Since it was my birthday, I threw my ethics out the window and (gasp!) ordered the veal shank osso buco. It was SO worth the guilt! The meat was fall-off-the-bone tender and so flavorful! The sides were all just as delectable and there was so much food I'll be enjoying it again come lunch time today. Beyond all of this, we found Bruno just as delightful as others have noted. He visited our table several times (but was never intrusive) to see how the meal was progressing. Knowing it was my birthday, they even wrote a special note on the dessert plate and surprised us with complimentary champagne. This was after several small unexpected additions throughout the meal.

2.0,9/23/2012,"Im surprised this restaurant received such rave reviews. I went here last night with my husband and thought it was OK. We usually dine at Capital Grille, Ruth Chris, STK etc. so we know good steak. Anyway, I bought the living social deal hoping that Club A would be added to my list but that will not be happening.We arrived at 8pm and were seated right away on the 2nd floor where the windows overlook trees with lights which was pretty. It was FREEZING in the restaurant, I'm talking uncomfortably cold. The couple next to us complained to the waiter that they were freezing and he replied ""it's the AC."" Thanks Captain Obvious! Apparently the restaurant wasn't aware that it was 60 degrees out and the AC set to 40 wasn't necessary. This made the meal that less enjoyable.Anyway, I must say the living social menu had a lot of options which was nice. I had the fried calamari which was Delish. For my entree, I had the the filet and Mac and cheese both ok and garlic fries. The fries at Smashburger are more gourmet than what we were served. Dessert was tiramisu which tasted like it had dish washing liquid in it..just tasted weird. My Cosmo tasted like juice which was a waste of money. I think the breaking point for me was when we received the check and they had the audacity to put a note letting us know what the meal actually cost and we should tip accordingly. With or without the note I was planning on leaving a $25 tip even though I was underwhelmed by the whole experience.Overall, I would not go back there, I am happy I didn't pay full menu price (not sure why people do) and would have been more content going to Outback.",0,0,0,Jay J.,"Bronx, NY",0,7,0
5.0,9/23/2012,"I've been holding off to write this review as I truly wanted to dedicate the right amount of time and energy to craft it with hopes to include and indulge in every fabulous detail.  So here it is...To begin, Jen V. had found this restaurant of course through Yelp's help while home in CA. With almost a near perfect review track record it was no doubt that our expectations of this establishment would be high and we would receive no less than that near perfect experience.  Boy, were we blown away as our dining experience, by far, trumped what our expectations were.  The menu is straight-forward and wine list even more spectacular.  We ordered some apps in which the escargot was the most memorable.  A few sides (truffle mac & cheese, steamed broccoli, brussels sprouts with bacon - YUM!, and wild mushrooms).  I had the Salmon, while the more carnivorous ones in our party each had either the Prime Dry Aged Rib Eye or Prime Dry Aged Porterhouse Steak.  All of this was cooked to perfection with no complaints from any of us.  We were all pretty fascinated by how well each and every dish was presented and tasted overall.  We paired all of this with a smooth 2007 Archery Summit Pinot which was poured via a Decanter that resembled a king cobra providing quite a flamboyant, yet very impressive, presentation.  Besides the food, Bruno and his entire staff was accommodating.  Bruno stopped to chat and check up on us several times throughout our meal ensuring that we were well taken care of.  This simple gesture added quite the personal touch for the evening; he seemed to truly care about his patrons.  In addition, he provided us with a taste of their famous Lobster Ravioli (on the house) - such an amazing surprise.  The ambiance was warm, welcoming and very romantic; the red walls and simple decor uttered a subtle uniqueness and air of mystery both at the same time.  To add to this, there was a band playing the night we dined which definitely contributed towards the elegance of the evening.Another member of our party had a birthday, and the restaurant provided us with an array of desserts (carrot cake, tiramisu, cream puffs and fruit) which were all so filling and incredible in flavor and consistency.I highly recommend Club A Steakhouse if you're searching for that unforgettable dining experience in NYC.  You won't be disappointed.

Aside from the amazing - perfectly cooked - steak, great service and beautiful decanters, the highlight for me was the manager. He's run this place for 30+ years and still walks the floor, speaking with guests, pouring wine and ensuring your food is cooked just the way you ordered it.

The vibe is more of the older crowd but comfortable enough. Service was friendly but a bit hard to get their attention at times when the restaurant filled up later in the evening. Now on to the food... To start we had the calamari which was very flavorful and a nice serving for four people. It was served warm and cooked quite nicely remaining perfectly tender. Next were our steaks. I had the filet mignon 10 oz (smaller size) cooked medium rare. It was super thick, nicely seasoned and perfectly cooked. They served it with a variety of sauces, but my favorite was the Club A steak sauce which had a nice sweetness to it that went well with my savory hunk of meat. For our sides, we got the creamed spinach, macaroni and cheese and the roasted mushrooms for the table. All were tasty and nicely prepared. I would recommend any or all of them. Since it was my friend's birthday, they brought a huge dessert platter to our table with a candle for my friend to blow out.

5.0,9/18/2012,"My fiancé and I have dined here twice, thanks to Living Social deals. Coincidentally, on each occasion one of us had been given some disappointing news earlier that day.  However, each time, this restaurant provided such a wonderful experience that we were able to forget those worries for the rest of the night - it really helped turn the day around. First, the food is delicious and the portions are generous. The appetizer salads were perfectly dressed and the calamari was nicely seasoned. The steak tartar is perhaps overkill if you are going to order steak for the next course - which you should.  The 10-oz filet (medium rare) was gorgeous: perfectly seared, seasoned and cooked.  We didn't need the homemade sauce - the filet was delicious on its own and neither of us experienced the wall of meat fatigue that we usually feel in finishing a steak.  For dessert we sampled the cream puffs and the tiramisu.  Just as our eyes widened at the rich creamy sweets already before us, the waiter brought out two crisp cannoli, compliments of the house.  Meals here are lavish from beginning to end. What makes this place special is the service, which is every bit as generous as the food.  For example, once I asked the waiter to remind me what the name of our wine was.  He disappeared for about ten minutes or so, and came back with the label. He had retrieved the bottle, soaked the label and carefully removed it so I could keep it (and then, incredibly, apologized that it was still ""slightly damp"").  It was touching, and just one of several examples of exceptional and warm-hearted service we have received here.  We look forward to coming back.",1,0,1,Kathryn R.,"ASTORIA, NY",3,5,0

We shared calamari and thick bacon as appetizers, both were yummy. We both ordered filet mignon as our entrée and the meat was tender. Sautéed spinach and garlic fries tasted good but they got cold quickly. Sadly, my favorite part of the meal was the most unmemorable.

Wherever you are, you somehow feel as if you're in your own little world...like a king with his own staff. It is a family place so you do not get that corporate steakhouse feel. You have the mother, father, and sons running the place, and by the end of the night you feel part of their family. Ok, now the food. Definitely the BIGGEST portions of any steakhouse. BUT more importantly, big portions of quality meat. It is hard to pull off simplicity, but here the 24 ounce Prime Dry Aged Rib Eye was perfect without any crazy tricks. Just a great piece of meat perfectly cooked. AGAIN..perfectly cooked. MANY times other places screw that up, but I and the other 5 people with me were impressed how exact the steaks' cooking were. Sides were great too. I forgot to mention appetizers...we all had the thick bacon. Very good. After the dinner, my brother noted, and we all agreed, that while we ate a lot of food, we somehow did not feel stuffed or bloated. My father, an ex-restaurant owner, always said : ""The best restaurant is where they know you"". At Club A, I felt like my friends and I went on some family vacation. For the icing on the cake....my friend who frequents Club A many times had his heart MELTED when Agron (one of the owner's son) presented him with a frame size pic of him and his fiancee' who got engaged at Club A just the week before!!!   It's THAT kind of place.

The meal was evenly paced, and no detail was overlooked. The porterhouse was as good as any I've had and coked perfectly to order.  I was a touch disappointed in the lamb chop only because I feel that a fine steakhouse should showcase a loin chop.

I was so taken aback by the exceptional service that I felt the need to put my thoughts down on ""paper"". My best friend and I have a tradition of finding a place that serves mouth-watering, Brontosaurus size steaks for celebratory occasions. We read reviews and decided to try Club A. We started the meal with a Caesar salad and a side of the bacon. THE bacon. My image of bacon has been forever altered, as this flavorful slab of pork fat was head and shoulders above anything that I have ever come across. For our main course, we had the Porterhouse for 2, presented in a manner that was fit for kings. As we were enjoying our meal, Bruno , owner of the establishment, came over to the table and politely asked how our meal was going. Nothing but good things to say. He asked how we had heard about the restaurant and we explained how we followed yelp reviews there. He graciously sent over not one, but two rounds of drinks on him.

We both got the NY strip, which was delicious!!! Perfectly cooked, no frills, just  salt/pepper/meat on the grill. The sides were also good: macaroni and cheese with creamed spinach. My only complaint would be that the macaroni and cheese was too saucy. After eating through the crusty, bubbly cheese on top (yum!), I felt like the rest of the noodles were just swimming in cheese sauce (not yum...)Although it was not the best steak I've ever had in my life, or in NYC, it was a good experience with pretty good food and service.

3.0,8/27/2012,"Where to begin.  This restaurant in NO WAY deserves 4.5 stars and how 700+ people had good experiences here is absolutely beyond me.I will start at the beginning.  My sister and I came here a couple weeks ago, I was visiting NY and wanted a good steak.  Some of my critiques may seem nit-picky, but if I am paying $100+ for a meal, I expect everything to be perfect down to the table setting.We get to our table and the first think I notice is the ugly tan tablecloth and napkins.  There is only one acceptable color for tablecloths at a nice restaurant, white.  On top of that the salt and pepper shakers were the exact same ones I bought at Walmart for $0.99, and they were dented.  The cheap candles were melting all over the place creating a puddle of wax on each table.  That is a look best reserved for family Italian, not a fancy restaurant.  Our waiter comes by with our water, mine has a bug in an ice cube, and the pitcher is a cheap plastic one that you would see at Denny's.  The waiter noticed the bug and brought me a new glass.We both ordered the filet mignon with Yukon gold potatoes.  Here is where they really failed.  The filet mignon wasn't cooked evenly!  The outer  was overcooked, tough, and crusty from being seared too long, and the inside was raw, not rare, raw (I ordered medium-rare).  Despite being a mostly raw filet mignon it was still very tough from not being cooked correctly.  If you are a steakhouse and can't cook a filet mignon correctly you fail as a restaurant.  Next were the potatoes, my sister and I agreed that the only seasoning that had been added was butter.  I can make better potatoes in my sleep, please try again.The dishes they served the food in were awkward natural clay that didn't match anything else in the restaurant.  For this kind of money, I expect a decent plating. Before leaving I went to the restroom to blow my nose, and they had the cheap, sandpaper toilet paper, and cheap napkins trying to be passed off as fancy paper towels.  Really guys, for $100 a person you can't splurge and get some Charmin and real paper towels??  My sister and I compared notes after dinner and she had noticed all of the things I mentioned, especially the toilet paper.In short the only thing that qualifies Club A Steakhouse  as a ""nice"" restaurant is the price and the wall decor.  Everything else, service, cleanliness, FOOD, table setting, was all on par with an Applebee's!I will never, ever go here again, nor would I recommend it to anyone.  It gets three stars because it was a decent meal despite being ridiculously overpriced for what you are actually getting, which is a poorly cooked steak with bland potatoes.",0,0,0,Jordan F.,"West Lafayette, IN",0,8,3
5.0,8/27/2012,"I had dinner here with 11 others for my bachelor party on Saturday and we all absolutely enjoyed every aspect of the experience here.

5.0,8/27/2012,"Following up my previous review:The next morning after writing my review for Club A, in which I highly praised the food but expressed my disappointing experience with the service, I received a phone call from Bruno, the owner of the restaurant. The fact that he paid personal attention to customers' reactions on Yelp and actually cared was impressive enough. He was extremely gracious, remembered where my boyfriend and I had been seated, and apologized for the sub-par service. He very generously invited us back to the restaurant with an offer of a bottle of wine on the house.To cut the story short: the food was again delicious, we were treated like royalty by the team of servers (yes a team, and I did observe that other tables were also treated equally well), Bruno was again there to oversee his restaurant and personally greet us, and we had such an enjoyable, lovely experience that before we knew it 3 hours had passed.I really can't stress enough my appreciation for a restaurant, or any business for that matter, where the owner puts so much time and dedication into his work and is willing to do so much to make his customers happy. This attitude is very obviously visible in the way the servers, bus boys, and hostess interact as well. Thank you again, Bruno, for a wonderful evening!",3,0,3,Dorothy L.,"Santa Monica, CA",11,6,0
5.0,8/27/2012,"Incredible experience. My friend picked me to be his best man, so I was responsible for planning the bachelor party. We wanted to start our night out with a nice steak dinner. So, I did some asking around and Club A came very highly recommended. I am not the best planner, so I just made a reservation for 12 and told them it was a bachelor party. When we arrived, they brought us to a private room with a TV, sound system (with iPod dock), and a balcony. It was perfect for a bachelor party. We were able to get a bit more rowdy than if we had sat in the regular section of the restaurant. Bruno, the manager I believe, was more than accomodating and our waiter, Patrick, was great. The staff was very professional but also made us feel comfortable.The steaks were phenominal. Very juicy and cooked to order. Probably the best steak I've ever heard. We had a few bottles of wine which were great and we were given a free round of Patron shots. They also gave us complimentary lobster raviolli which was excellent. When the bill came, it was less than we expected (about $110 per person). Very reasonable, in my opinion, for the amount of food and alcohol that was had.Overall, it was the perfect way to start our night. Couldn't have been happier with Club A. I will definitely be going back with my girlfriend or parents for a steak.

4.0,8/22/2012,"1 pound (16 oz) Filet Mignon is the best slab of meat I've had.  Sounds weird but at $42 it's a bargain bin type deal.  Looks like an asteroid and inside it's a perfect fade of grey to pink to red and it cuts like cake, not a trace of grease yet it was packed with juices, each bite was heaven and at same time depressing to know it would soon be gone.  If you're craving a steak and don't care for side dishes then Club A is a must visit.Free warm olive bread and freedom onion soup came out like bats outtve hell and it seemed we were headed for a 5 star meal.  Would've been if not for those disgraceful side dishes.  Truffled mac n cheese was more like trifling mac n cheese as it was a mirror image of Kraft Easy Mac, serving this with that great steak is like throwing spinner hubcaps on a benz, couldn't be a worse pair.  Mushrooms were pretty good but all that's required to make good shrooms is a pulse.  Brussel sprouts tasted like they were ordered in from the nearest asian joint, if i knew they were ordering in I would've asked to get me some good side dishes from Del Friscos.  Not that I'd ever put sauce on a filet but if I did it wouldnt be Heinz 57, which is what their homemade steaksauce tasted like, has to be different people calling the shots on the steak and the rest of the food.Selecting a dessert is like picking your poison, weak selection that seems italian influenced, we chose tiramisu.  Not bad but nothing memorable, they need a good chocolate cake, not mousse but cakeInterior is classy as it gets and service was greatFilet & soup combo get an A+ but the supporting cast are F listers, if the steak isn't consistently the best then I'd skip this place for sure, they need to take notes from Del Friscos on how to offer great sides and desserts and make a start to finish great meal",4,3,2,Nick A.,"Pompano Beach, FL",106,337,189

THREE groups of people who sat down AFTER us got their food before us. and you could tell we were waiting a LONG time because our candle melted down and spread all over our table. i'm not one to quietly overlook this and was seriously upset when i had raved about this place to my bf. it just made me look like i appreciated bad service.the scowl on my face and the crossed arms must have sent some alarms because 3 waiters came NONSTOP filling our glasses with water and brought 3 FREE sides.the spinach, i dont like. i just don't like how it tastes like seafood. which is disappointing because i love truffle oil.the mac & cheese has some herb to it. it's ok.garlic fries had more rosemary than garlic. i would love to taste more garlic.the potatoes were incredibly soft and whipped into clouds of heaven. the asparagus was ok. i suggest eating the asparagus with the whipped potatoes and eat the garlic fries with the mac & cheese- they complimented each other well.my bf got his meat medium but it was cooked medium well. he said the food was good but he couldn't properly assess it because it wasn't cooked to the way he prefers his steak.the meat just wasn't as tender as the first time so the experience fell a little short.all-in-all, i was ready to come home to write a negative review, but they pulled through with the service. they apologized numerous times and really showed their remorse by stuffing us with food.the boss was also there watching everything--WHICH i appreciate because it shows that he cares about excellence and quality. he walked around SEVERAL times--i think i saw him about 6 times, but then again, i was at the place for 2 HOURS also.i still highly recommend this place to anyone. service, in the end, was good and the steak was great.OH! and the red sauce. i don't know what it is but it's sweet and GREAT with the steak.

4.0,8/17/2012,"4.25 starsLook people, this is the BEST STEAKhouse! Go here and order just that, nothing more or you may be slightly disappointed. The filet mignon is the largest, most amazing steak I have ever had....and for a bargain price of $42 it was worth every red cent!! Warm olive and french breads was served to us first and what a great way to begin this feast. Both breads paired really well with the French onion soup. It was cheesy, full of onions and a nice taste of sherry at the end. When the main course came I though I died and went to heaven; a 16oz gigantic steak looking like a million bucks, just waiting to be devoured by a hungry little brown bear (me!) It cut like butter and inside was cooked to perfection; it literally melts in the mouth so chewing is optional but not required. We ordered the 3 for $24 side dish special to try a little bit of everything and this is where the disappoint lies. ""truffled"" Mac and cheese was almost an embarrassment to our table, it looked like Velveeta and there was nothing truffled about it. The Brussel sprouts were cooked with Canadian bacon and that smoked flavor was all I could taste. The mushrooms were really good but not hard to make at home if you wanted to. Next time I want to just order the Idaho potato purée and hopefully that changes my mind about the side dishes here. For desert we ordered a tiramisu. It was good but not the best I've ever had (@Johns on 12th) the waiter gave us some complimentary home made chocolate and vanilla ""ice cream"" thing wrapped in a fudge outside and a maraschino cherry on the inside. It too was good but I wouldn't order it unless I was craving ice cream which is rare. We must have had the best table inside the restaurant because I fell in love with the ambiance and the service was perfect too.

I ordered the Royalty Platter which is a seafood appetizer. It was very large compared to what other places provide and a good value for the large shrimp, lump crab meat and lobster. Truly, it could have served as my entree. I also ordered the lobster ravioli as my entree and it was delicious! Everyone in our party agreed and received their own taste. But I honestly have to say however, that what really blew us all away was the spectacular service we received from everyone who served our table. My husband's steak was overcooked and the things staff did to rectify this were above and beyond the call.

4.0,8/16/2012,"My friend Angie, got the idea of going to a steakhouse for restaurant week, and I was like suuuuure. I looked up the menu before going, and I got excited about the steak tartare. One of my favorites when a restaurant does it right. I would love to give this place a 5 star rating, but there was two dislikes. The first one, the steak tartare, I felt it should of came with something crunchy. If it wasn't for the crackers in the bread basket, it would be a totally down fall. The Steak Tartare itself was seasoned great. Second it would be the garlic fries. I asked the waiter, if the fries was hand cut fries. He told me ""it was"", even though it didn't say that on the menu. I took his word, but once I received the fries at the table, I didn't believed it. It looked like fries that they got from a bag that was frozen. It tasted like it too. I wish I got the mac and cheese instead.I enjoyed the warm fresh bread very much. The olive and rosemary bread was my favorite in the basket.I ordered the filet mignon, which was seasoned great, and was juicey. I was happy about that piece of meat. For dessert I got the tiramisu, and that was delicious. They gave the table cannolies on the house. Which was very nice of them, and delicious as well.The staff of the place, was friendly and wanting your experience to be the best. The hostess even went to pull out my char for me.

We chose this place because it was a convenient location and not wanting to go deal with the better known carnivoriums around the area. The restaurant ambiance was nice. Quiet setting downstairs for smaller groups. Upstairs had a nice bar and and semi private area that seemed to be perfect for large groups. It looked like they had a number of larger groups up there. We ordered a lot of food. started out with a decent ceasar salad. Predictable and unassuming. Ordered a slab of canadian bacon which was thick and smelled great. It was not as crispy as I would normally like it and a little too fatty. I actually had to use the steakhosue sauce which gives you an indication of taste. they brought out lobster ravioli as an amuse bouche which was a pleasant surprise. One of us was allergic to lobster so they brought out a mozzarella and tomato replacement. Very nice. Main course we ordered the t-bone steak for two medium rare. It came out sizzling and drowned in butter. Steak had potential but it was just ok in flavor. Not sure why but just didn't give me the same mouth watering anticipation that a medium rare steak normally gives me. We had mashed potaoes, creamed spinach, french fries and mushrooms for sides. The service was top notch, ambiance was nice and relaxed. Unfortunately steak was average.

I convinced a group of friends to come here over some other steak houses for Restaurant week...and convinced a friend to buy a Living Social deal a couple of months ago..thinking my visit last summer was a fluke after the great experience I had the first time.  Service was ok this time, better than the last time I was here but nothing like the first time I came.  The bacon appetizer was great as always and the highlight of the meal.  Calamari was good.  But like the second time I was here, the steak was just ok - they seem to be cooking on the more ""done"" side, so I would recommend ordering under by a shade.  I ordered my filet medium and it was cooked well - not pink inside in the slightest.  I don't think anyone was particularly impressed with their steaks (filets and hanger steaks).  Sides - creamed spinach, whipped potatoes and mac and cheese were good.  Tiramisu was good, though I think the lady fingers could use another dose of espresso, they were very dry this time around.  So the biggest disappointment is the steak, which it's hard to give a great review when it's the entree that is the issue and this is a steakhouse!",0,0,0,Food E.,"Manhattan, NY",8,587,219
5.0,8/12/2012,"Amazing place.. some of the BEST service I have had in the city and amazing food. Went during restaurant week but my date and I will be back again. All the servers and hosts were so nice, and the owner even checked on us a few times and sent us complimentary drinks, just because we were enjoying ourselves so much! They had live jazz there but I highlightly recommend sitting on the 2nd floor, you can hear them music throughout but you get a really nice open view and the trees outside have lights so it adds a nice ambiance.Between my date and I we had the calamari, steak tartar, filet, truffle spinach and  tiramisu... it was phenomenal! I ate everything.. and the Riesling there is so tasty.Can't say enough good things and left feeling great and full.. the hospitality feels like you're dining at a close family friend's restaurant.

5.0,8/12/2012,"Five stars for being treated and fed like royalty!!! Also, forget taking etiquette classes if you're ever crazy enough to consider that; I found myself conversing with my dinner companions formally, sitting up straight without being told to, and refusing to eat french fries with my fingers- because that's utterly uncouth in such an elegant steakpalace like this! I know I'll never be royalty no matter how much I pretend to be, but thanks for the experience, Club A Steakhouse, which is not only high-end in terms of their food, but their service and decor as well, and I would go back in a heartbeat wearing my best business casual outfit or a lovely dress.I immediately looked up the menu online after a recommendation by a fellow yelper for a great steakhouse (thanks again, Shing Yiing O.!) and thought it would be a great restaurant to get my steak fix, and off me and two of my guy friends went on a Thursday night. What a great, great choice!!! I was absolutely blown away by the decor of this elegant and classy place. The dim lighting, candlelight, roses, and red color scheme on the walls and ceiling truly makes this restaurant a romantic gem worthy of proposals and anniversaries. On Opentable where I made my reservation, I requested a table on the second floor, and sure enough they were happy to oblige. The waitstaff were extremely polite and friendly, and even gentlemanly- when a waiter came to take our orders, he looked at me first since I was the only girl at the table. For an appetizer, I ordered classic Caesar salad with shaved parmesan and pepper- which turned out to be a delicious salad that I savored with each bite. My friend didn't like the bread that was served because it had olives in it, but the waiter made sure that he got bread without olives- I hate olives too but the bread was delish, so I happily continued munching.It was also at Club A Steakhouse that I found out that steak could be butterflied. When the waiter asked me if I wanted my filet mignon butterflied, I truly revealed my peasant status by admitting I didn't know what it was- after I stared at him for a few seconds, dazed and confused. He explained and demonstrated how the steak would be cut and I agreed to have it done, only for my friends to tell me that butterflying would dry out the steak. Oh well...but even though it wasn't juicy- leaning towards the well-done scale- it was, so far, the best steak I've ever had. Oh-so-flavorful, just the right amount of tenderness and toughness... I never wanted it to end. The french fries that I ordered with it has such a pleasantly salty and garlicky taste that put all other french fries to shame- it was the elite class of french fries, that's for sure! For dessert, we shared cream puffs and tiramisu... and cannolis on the house!! They were all sweet and tasty, but my favorite was the tiramisu.... the best I've ever had!! When putting out and removing our dishes, the waitstaff were incredibly efficient, swooping in to remove our plates and utensils and replacing them with the next course, refilling our water, asking us if everything was okay, and even fielding questions from my friend about whether the fries were hand cut or not (they said it was, but my friend remained skeptical. Hey, as long as the fries tasted great, that's all that mattered to me!)If I could give this place 10 stars, I would. I could only fantasize about being proposed to over steak and wine in an elegant place like this! Well, never hurts to dream (and it sure beats being proposed to in a diner, that's for sure!) But proposal or not, I will be back!",2,1,1,Angie K.,"Brooklyn, NY",65,60,144
5.0,8/10/2012,"6 of us went to Club A for restaraunt week and I have to say - best decision ever. Our table wasn't ready exactly at 7:30 for our reservation so Bruno (the owner, who we all fell in love with by the end of the night) came down and ordered our next round of drinks on him. We only waited another 10 minutes before being seated so it wasn't a big deal at all. Once we got upstairs our waiter, Astrik, came by to explain the menu. Just like Bruno, we adored this guy. He was attentive, efficient and very friendly. As for the food it was delicious. The only thing that didn't tickle my fancy was the macaroni and cheese. I ordered: - Mixed Greens Salad- Chicken - the chicken was so moist and so soft it was basically melting in my mouth.- Mashed potatoes - some of the best I've EVER had. And mashed potatoes are my favorite foodFor desert, Bruno took care of us because we were celebrating 2 birthday, an anniversary and an engagement. At the end of the meal we ended up with cheesecake, cream puffs (my favorite!), tiramasu and a few other things I didn't recognize. Overall, I'd come back her again and again.

I been here twice, both for restaurant week, and the service and food was amazing! I ordered the Fried Calamari the 1st time, Steak Tartare the 2nd time as an appetizer, Steak Hanger the 1st time, Filet Migon the 2nd time as an entree, Cream Puffs the 1st time and Tiramusu the 2nd time for dessert.

5.0,8/9/2012,"We came for our anniversary dinner which happened to fall during restaurant week. Score. I  was a little nervous that we would get the side eye for our $35 RW menu choices but it was a wonderful experience. We were 10 minutes late for our reservation but we only waited 5 minutes to be seated. We were seated upstairs by the window with the tree that had the white lights. The ambiance is very romantic. Everything is red as other Yelpers have stated, they light a real candle at your table, the lights are low and there is a red rose at your table. Sexy time! The servers were friendly and asked my questions about the choice of wine. They constantly came to check up on us but not in an annoying way. They were friendly and attentive. Our wine and water glasses were never less than empty. My husband told the waiter "" Your making our anniversary dinner so  great!"" (Remember this for later in the meal.) Now let's get to the menu.  We got the bottle of Malbec 2011 ($25 why not?) For appetizer hubby and I both had the classic Cesar salad. It had a nice flavor and was not too overdressed. For the entree we both had the filet Mignon. I didn't know what to expect as to the size but it wasn't too small at all. I ordered it medium and it was perfect on the inside. The outside had a nice crust on it which I actually like. For sides we got the Yukon mashed potatoes and the creamed spinach with truffle oil. The potatoes were divine and oh so creamy. The spinach was good but the truffle oil gave it an off taste (mind you I have never had truffle oil before so I am not taking points off for this).  We scraped the plates on everything. For dessert hubby ordered the tiramisu and I got the cream puffs which we were going to share. When they brought out dessert it was on a giant plate that had ""Happy Anniversary"" on it with a candle. How adorable! I mean how could you now love that?! They also gave us the complimentary cannolis and 2 glasses of champagne. Lord I fell in love with this place! The tiramisu was on par with others that I have tasted but the cream puffs needed a little something. Towards the end of the dinner the owner came over and wished us a happy anniversary and told us that he had been married for 37 years with 5 kids and 3 grandkids. I thought that was very nice of him to come over and speak with us. Overall we had a wonderful experience. The food was delicious, the service was spot on and the overall ambiance of the restaurant was just right for our anniversary dinner.  My hubby is already planning the next meal here!",0,0,0,Suriyati B.,"Queens, NY",35,276,9

4.0,8/8/2012,"I came here for restaurant week for the price fixed menu with a big group of people, 14 people large. The service was wonderful, very attentive. I chose to have the Canadian bacon for appetizer (before I knew they were going to give everyone half a piece of complimentary bacon), Filet Mignon for main course with a side of truffle oil infused creamed spinach, and tiramisu for dessert. Complimentary lobster ravioli and canolis were inserted in between. I could have done without the canolis, I thought they were too sweet, but it was the only low point of the feast. The 16oz filet mignon was absolutely tender, spiced to the right degree. Perfection. The best steak I've had in NYC. Spinach was also the melt in your mouth kind. A good offset to the heartiness of the steak. Tiramisu was alright, the lady fingers somewhat weren't part of the cake as they didn't cut easily and fell out, but overall, very much enjoyed the meal.Wine, good food, good service.

5.0,8/8/2012,"I love Restaurant Week, but I always feel a little skeptical towards it, like high end restaurants who normally charge $40+ for an entree may harbor some resentment towards you and your underpriced meal and not quite go out. Enter Club A Steakhouse, one of the few RW menus to also feature a side dish with the entree. I ordered the Canadian bacon, filet mignon with mac and cheese side, and creme puffs. I didn't have high hopes for portion size and half expected the filet mignon to be the size of a quarter. Turns out I couldn't even finish the meal! The canadian bacon slice could have been an entree on its own. The filet mignon was larger the steaks you get at Outback and perfectly done. It shames me to mention Outback in the same breath as Club A, but everyone knows Outback so it makes for good size comparison. Lots of macaroni and cheese. Three creme puffs AND they gave us cannoli. Insanity. But I don't question it. Excellent meal, good service, and would be totally worth paying full price for. Will definitely be back here!",2,1,0,Katie I.,"Brooklyn, NY",23,139,1

My friend and I made a 9pm reservation for a Saturday night, which is not normal for Restaurant Week, but the host assured me that they would offer the menu on Saturday. Sweet.My first impression was that this is definitely a good date spot. The lights are dim, there's live jazz music playing in the background, and the overall feel is very intimate and cozy. It was still quite busy for a late hour on Saturday, but the service was attentive when we needed them. We ordered a bottle of white wine to complement our meal, which was top notch.To make a long review short, here are the things we ordered:Appetizer- Fried calamari - How can you ever go wrong with fried calamari?- Soup of the day - Mmm mushroom puree...Main Course- Filet Mignon (medium rare) - Bloody, tender and flavorful! And I'm not usually a fan of blood.- Brook Trout - Served with asparagus and a lemon butter sauce (I think?), the whole trout (no bones!) was moist and delicious!Dessert- Homemade Cream Puffs - Probably the worst thing on this menu, but that being said, it was still pretty good and we ate the whole thing!- Homemade Tiramisu - OMG...I think I just had a mouth-gasm...- Cannoli - Our water offered cannolis for us to try on the house! We were so full though that we took it to go and enjoyed it the next day.By the way, there was a huge snake-like wine pitcher that came with the red wine that the table next to us ordered.

5.0,8/7/2012,"This was more than a great meal, this was a fantastic dining experience. I was in town with my father and brother to watch the Yanks play at the new Stadium. I was looking to get a nice steak after and we made reservations through Yelp at Club A. Great decision. The decor is very unique. It's dimly lit, and there were quite a few couples on dates. The servers were very friendly and attentive. We had 4 sets of hands at our table through the course of the evening and our wine and water were never empty. Started with the escargot, shrimp cocktail and buffalo mozz and tomato. All were prepared perfectly. Especially the escargot. Cooked in butter and garlic, just can't get any better than that. All 3 of us decided on the 16oz filet (at $42, quite a steal), and we had the truffle mac and cheese, asparagus and mushrooms. The steaks were cooked perfectly, which is very hard to do with a pound of filet. Sides were good. Mac and cheese was well done, not an overload of truffle like most. We opted to skip dessert to go to Club Macanudo and smoke a stick. The owner brought our check over with 3 grappas in hand. Great way to wash the meal down, and was just another little thing that made this place great. Food - AService - A+Decor - BBang for your buck - AOverall, this place was great.

It was such a nice personal touch. All the waiters were super attentive and nice and even cracked jokes with us. Food was AMAZING. I came for restaurant week and started off the with the steak tartare followed by the veal and then the homemade tiramisu. Honestly by the second bite of my veal I was full. It is definitely worth the money. And they gave complimentary dishes like their crab stuffed ravioli and homemade cannoli. Honestly the food was just so tasty and when the service is just as good it makes a meal just that much more special. Im definitely coming back here.

Ladies and gentleman, Don't come here wearing t shirt and jeans!; but I think you guys already know that. This place is dimly lit so it's perfect for romantic dates.Onto the food: We ordered from the restaurant week menu so we got to try 2 different appetizers, entrees, sides and dessert and all of them were fairly good. The dishes that really shined for me were the bacon, creamed spinach, filet mignon, and tiramisu. Things to skip: Cream puffs, mac and cheese. Mac and cheese was good but it wasn't anything I couldn't make at home. It also lacked flavor along with sharp flavor I usually like in my mac&cheese. My cream puffs were kinda soggy. The shell wasn't crispy and fluffy. (something fresh cream puff shells should be) Overall a decent meal for two came out to be around 50 a head.(tips and tax included- we paid a big tip) Not bad for a steak house but I don't think I'd be back here when there isn't restaurant week deals going on.

It goes very well with all kinds of grilled menu. Okay, back to our main subject!- Fried Calamari (appetizer): Great! crispy, not overly battered. Marinara sauce was also great.   - Filet Mignon: Great! What can I say more..- Prime Dry Aged Porterhouse steak (for 2~3): It's not on the restaurant week menu. My friend got this and he really loved it. There are two types of steak: dry-aged and wet-aged. I heard that the real high-level steakhouse is usually very good at cooking dry-aged beef. Bingo, Club A Steakhouse is so! This dish serves half filet mignon and half sirloin. It's just perfect. MUST try. - Side dishes: would recommend sauteed jumbo asparagus. Creamed spinach, ah-okay. - Dessert: go for Tiramisu! It's actually really good. Not overly sweet. All the servers were very careful. Interior design is very antique, something like in Romantic era.

5.0,7/26/2012,"Holy cow, Club A is the steakhouse of my dreams. I hate to admit it, but before my recent trip there, I had never been to a steakhouse (Outback doesn't count, right?), so much as ordered a steak anywhere. So when my boyfriend suddenly recalled that he had an expired Livingsocial deal there, I decided I had waited too long and jumped on the chance to go. I called and the hostess was extremely nice and said we can, of course, put the value towards a meal. A few days later I was walking into the beautiful and romantic restaurant, shaking in anticipation. I was greeted by the host and was seated upstairs by the windows. Holy cow, the place is beautiful. Its romantic and extravagant and everything a restaurant should be, as you suddenly realize.We started off with fried calamari. What are these heavenly pieces of squid? This is calamari, you say? Because...if it is, what have I been eating my entire life up until this point? As per my reaction, our very knowledgeable waiter informed us that the owner used to be in the Italian cuisine game so naturally the fried calamari is to die for. I literally don't know how I'm going to eat fried calamari anywhere else now.I knew right away I wanted to try the Filet Mignon. In fact, I might have dreamed about it every night after making the reservation. Medium, filet mignon, with a side of truffle oil spinach and the softest potato puree you will ever taste. After taking that first bite, I think it was the first time I have ever truly been left speechless. This was what I have been missing out on. This is what I was missing when I've been ordering burgers? Burgers? I can never eat a burger again. [Okay, so that's a lie, I do love my burgers] but seriously, the filet mignon is GOOD. The sides are GOOD. Everything is just so...delicious.I was in such a trance, I barely registered what kind of wine I drank or dessert I ate. All I recall was that it was heavenly, as the rest of the meal suggested. I cannot begin to stress how great of an experience my time at Club A was. Its restaurant week right now, so I highly encourage you to visit there and try everything I just mentioned.

But lets get down to the food shall we? bacon appetizer - good! It was a bigger portion than I imagined, could definitely fill you up if you're not a big eater. And maybe I was lucky but mine wasn't THAT fatty either. 2/3 of it was meat and 1/3 fat. Very nice balance. beef tartare - awesome! It was my first time eating it and I have to say I was thoroughly surprised. Reminded me of tuna sashimi hahaHangar Steak - not so good. It was kind of chewy and tough, even though it was cooked medium? Maybe because I've been to tons of steakhouses, but the hangar steak didn't impress me much. Veal Shank - good! big portion and really soft/tender with good flavor. Plus you get to munch on the marrow if you're into that. Spinach - awesomeWhipped Potatoes - awesomeMac n Cheese - awesomeGarlic Fries - not so awesome...actually they suckedDessert was okay. Nothing impressive, in my opinion. The tiramisu was kind of heavy and not that moist. Cream puffs were okay, then again I don't think you can really mess that up? They also gave us cannolis on the house and they tasted like they were in the fridge for a whole week....so, if I knew better I'd skip dessert and go somewhere else.",2,0,0,Arthur L.,"Chinatown, Manhattan, NY",164,121,63
5.0,7/23/2012,"Club A Steakhouse was an amazing experience. I found out about this place through a LivingSocial Deal recommended through a friend who has given this restaurant high praise for everything from their service to the food, and I can now see why. The atmosphere of this place evokes qualities that ask for you to come here for special occasions and/or dates, intimate gatherings, etc. Upon entering, expect to be greeted by a warm, friendly staff member who brings you to your table. Waiters greet you politely and converse in a friendly manner. Now, for the food, I must say that for even under a LivingSocial deal, I could not have been more satisfied by the choices before me. In terms of appetizers, I really liked the steak tartare, but you must try their thick cut bacon; it's the most succulent piece of bacon you will ever have in your life that literally melts in your mouth. For entree, I definitely recommend their Veal Osso Buco or the Hanger Steak. Actually, you cannot really go wrong with any of their choices. The food here is absolutely delicious and of high quality. Expect to leave here with a fully satisfied appetite. For dessert, I could not have been happier. On top of the dessert my husband and I ordered, they were so generous enough to give us a free dessert on top of our order! How amazing is their service.

The service was absolutely faultless. I ended up choosing the Canadian bacon to start with and the filet mignon as a main. That bacon was amazing! Just shut your eyes to the fat content and enjoy the juicy succulence! I'd never had filet mignon before and wasn't sure what to expect - but was not disappointed with a thick piece of veeerry tasty and tender steak. I'm glad I ordered it medium rare though as any more well done and I suspect it would have been a little dry.  We shared the truffled spinach and mashed potato which made excellent accompaniments. My friend was very happy with her steak tartar and salmon - the latter was a surprisingly generous portion. The desserts I have to say were slightly underwhelming (hence the docking of one star) but we were so full from the previous courses we didn't mind so much.So...

I'm not a big steak tartare expert, but it tasted a little like relish. A sweetness to it.  Nobody else at my table loved my appetizer.  But the Canadian bacon was delicious, as was the calamari. A friend commented that the marinara was very nicely done.I ordered my steak medium, and I was disappointed at how dry it seemed.  My friend also ordered hers medium and the deep center of her steak was the only part I really enjoyed.  My husband got it medium rare, and it made a huge difference. We thought it was good, but nothing spectacular. (Well, I thought it was just ok).Surprisingly enough, our friend's thyme chicken was very juicy. I was jealous. He enjoyed it immensely.As for the side dishes, we could smell the truffle oil in the spinach but couldn't really taste it. It was good though. I thought the highlight of the side dishes was the mac and cheese. The desserts were a little bland. I've been spoiled with really tasty and authentic canolis, so I didn't approve. The cream puffs were bland.  They had a great special on wine for $25.  We got the Malbec.  It was lovely, and yes, it did get poured out of a zany looking decanter. It looked like a coiled snake and we were told it was worth $500. I made sure not to knock it off the table.We got a lot of friendly good byes on our way out.

5.0,7/11/2012,"I've eaten here twice, and the second time was even better than the first! On occasion, Living Social offers discounted vouchers for this restaurant and I jumped at the chance after trying it once. Both times, I ordered the filet mignon. The steak is tender, juicy, and slightly red inside cooked medium-rare, just the way I like it. Compared to other NY steakhouses, the quality of the steak belongs right up there in the top tier. The starters and sides are just as good as the main course. I absolutely loved the thickly sliced bacon and steak tartare appetizers. I have a very difficult time recommending one side over another since they are all so good, but my favorites would have to be the homemade macaroni and cheese and the cream truffle spinach. For dessert, you really can't go wrong with anything, but my personal favorite was the homemade tiramisu.As excellent as the food is, the service truly deserves a shout out. On both visits, our waiter went out of his way to make sure that our time here was truly memorable. He was happy to recommend a perfect wine, was very friendly, and provided instant service.

4.0,7/6/2012,"We came to Club A Steakhouse last Friday night with a Living Social deal for $75 that was for a three course dinner for two. It included an appetizer, entree, and dessert for each person! Awesome deal! They collected the voucher at the host's counter and they led us upstairs to a nice quiet private area upstairs by the window for our 7PM reservation. There was only one other couple sitting there at the time.I ordered the calamari for appetizer, filet mignon for the entree with mac and cheese as the side, and the tiramisu for dessert. He ordered the calamari for appetizer, hanger steak for the entree with garlic fries as the side, and the creme puffs for dessert.Let's start with the calamari. They were nice and crispy and it came with the marinara sauce for dipping. It was pretty good. We both liked it.The filet mignon looked small, but thick. It was okay. Since I ordered it medium-well it was a little dry. I'll know to order it medium next time. But it was really filling with the mac and cheese and the garlic fries. The mac and cheese were amazing and I loved it! We killed the mac and cheese because we were just hooked on it. The garlic fries were okay because I had it somewhere else before that was even better. As for the hanger steak, it was nice and juicy and big since it was medium. I liked the hanger steak a lot more.The tiramisu was so good! Nice and soft! I loved it! The creme puffs came in 3 pieces and was drizzled with the creme and it was so good too! It is fried dough, but it was light and perfect with the creme! Amazing! :)I would definitely come back here another time because it is a really nice and classy restaurant. I liked it a lot. The waiters were all attentive and the plus side was that we felt like VIP because we had such a huge private section since nobody else was there yet until we were almost done with our meal! Then, it started to get really busy for them. However, the location is not the best because it is on 58th Street between 3rd and 2nd Avenues. It is a lot closer to 2nd Avenue so it was a long 2 avenue walk from the 59th Street and Lexington Avenue station and it was just really hot that day.",0,0,0,Amy M.,"Manhattan, NY",51,303,615

I cannot thank everyone enough at this restaurant for the extraordinary service and food. For appetizers, we had the fried calamari. It was seasoned well and tasted even better. For entrees, I had the salmon which was cooked to perfection! Probably the best salmon I have ever had. The truffle oil infused creamed spinach was creamy and even for you non spinach lovers, this is a treat! My mother had the pork chop which was equally as good. My niece had the steak and it was ""melt in your mouth"" good. Since it was my mother's birthday the waiter brought out this elaborate dessert with just about everything on it (see pic). We also had additional homemade cream puffs to eat which were light and fluffy! The waiters were attentive and could not be kinder.

I happened to have the same experience and this could not be just a coincidence but rather their way of doing business. In my case the waiter tried to add a random item we never ordered to the bill; I guess he really wanted my extra $20 on top of $120+ bill.The worst part was that steaks were very mediocre at most. Atmosphere is what tourists think the definition of old New York should be (read other reviews; this will be confirmed). Strange.I am honestly shocked by the high ratings that this place gets.

The waiters were incredibly sweet and attentive, the single red rose on each candlelit table was a lovely touch, and the live jazz music made for a truly romantic evening for me and my boyfriend on his birthday. He started with the fried calamari which was wonderful (the marinara dipping sauce was a bit spicy which I love), and my steak tar-tar was perfect. I love steak tar-tar. I'm still upset that Petite Abeille got rid of it years ago.For main course I got the filet mignon while he got the hanger steak. Both were delicious. He was concerned about the redness of the filet (I ordered it medium rare) but I assured him it tasted as medium rare should taste. We also split three sides: creamed spinach (amazing), mashed potatoes (so creamy and buttery!), and the mac & cheese (perfect). For dessert we had the tiramisu and cream puffs. I don't like cream puffs so I cannot comment on them but he enjoyed them.

4.0,6/18/2012,"First time eating there.  We sat upstairs which was quieter than the main level and thought the space was nicer because there were windows.  The crab cake appetizer was very good and the steaks (ribeye & filet mignon) were perfectly cooked and seasoned.  The herbed fries were only ok, but the wild mushroom side dish was really tasty also.  Our waiter was very attentive and wasn't remotely bothered by me changing my mind on which bottle of wine I wanted to order with dinner when my first choice was sold out.  The most impressive part of the night was when the waiter picked up on the fact that it was my friend's birthday - didn't say a word - he just saw him being handed a card.  Shortly after dinner was finished they came over with 2 plates and then afterwards a dessert sampler with Happy Birthday scrolled in chocolate in the plate and 2 glasses of sparkling wine.  I was really impressed by that and it definitely left an impression.  I would definitely go back there again.",0,0,0,Dayna C.,"Hampton Bays, NY",0,5,0

Sure the servers were nice but nothing out of the ordinary.  Given we were there with the Livingsocial deal.We started with the green salad and the Canadian bacon.  Both were good, but I've had better.  The bacon could have been cooked a little longer to dry out the fat just a little bit longer because it was too chewy. Both had the filet mignon which were both cooked to perfection.  The best part of the meal and the reason why this got 3.5. The meat was intact but soft.  Ordered medium rare and that is exactly what I got.For sides we got the creamed spinach and garlic fries.  Who likes the spinach ever?  And well the garlic fries were soggy and flimsy, two qualities I do not like in fries.  The two desserts were good, creme puffs and tiramisu, my favorite being the latter.  I feel like only half the effort is put in.  They do certain things well others not so well.  Call me picky.  I don't think I'd go back without a deal.  My date made the dinner enjoyable.",0,0,1,Patrick M.,"San Francisco, CA",22,61,2

For our entrees we tried the hanger steak and the filet mignon but both tasted on the chewier end to me. I could not eat too much of either. For the desserts, they brought us cream puffs, tiramisu, and carrot cake on the house for my birthday. Candles, singing, the whole thing.

BEST Customer SERVICE I've ever received!I came for dinner with 6 other ladies after walking the Brooklyn Bridge in 50 degree weather. We were tired, hungry, and decided to treat ourselves to a lovely steak dinner as it was our first trip in NYC. We were all winded and cold, when you first arrive for dinner, lights are dim, candlelight at every table, live music, and red walls create a romantic and intimate appeal. Definitely impressed. We were a little hesitant at first thinking, 16oz. steaks for decent pricing?... interesting. Portions came out huge. I ordered the Filet Mignon and we shared the three sides that included, mac and cheese, potatoes, and creamed spinach. We ordered one bottle of wine, which they served in a very innovative and visually pleasing aerator resembling a french horn. The servers here were very attentive and friendly. We were all impressed by how friendly they were as they were very quick to fill our glasses and serve everything fresh. The owner is such a sweetheart, we observed how he greeted every party in the restaurant, and even stopped by our table to proudly show us a picture of his granddaughters. The walls of the restaurant are lined with pictures of the owner with various guests over the years, in black and white photographs. This is definitely a man who has guests coming back. You can tell the owner treated all his guests like family and truly enjoyed making sure everyone was taken care of. Not only were we given complimentary appetizers, we were also taken care of on the house with a bottle of wine, platter of steak shared by the table, 3 sides, and an impressive fruit platter for dessert. When we left for the evening, the owner came out again to personally shake our hands and thank us for coming to his restaurant.

5.0,5/27/2012,"Club A is a phenomenal restaurant that happens to be a steakhouse and I enthusiastically recommend that everyone who enjoys fine steak dining try this place out.  I have dined here three times already in short order, the first on my birthday, the second as a family gathering and the third on a living social deal.  This restaurant was recommended to me initially by co-workers who had purchased a living social deal.  I will discuss the food shortly, but make no mistake the real reason to go to this place is to experience outstanding service as well as get acquainted with Bruno, the delightful patriarch of this restaurant family.Let's discuss food.  You are immediately greeted by a basket of delicious bread; the onion bread is my favorite.  As for appetizers you cannot go wrong with trying a slice of the bacon, which is similar to Wolfgang's and Peter Luger's in that it is thick cut.  Additionally the steak tartare is another go-to appetizer that when combined with the bread, already provided, is feast of the senses.  My only wish is that they offered the ability to get an even larger portion of the steak tartare.  The meat is extraordinarily high quality and I suspect it is purchased from the same distributors that the other high quality steakhouses buy from.  I enjoy the softball size Filet Mignon (16 oz) but I have also been known to wolf down the Prime NY Strip (18 oz), if the mood should strike me.  The sides are a real treat and I appreciate the effort to promote value with the 3 sides for $24 option.  I recommend and have enjoyed the Creamed Spinach, Whipped Yukon Potato Puree, German Style Hash Brown.  My hat goes off to the 5 Cheeses Truffle ""Mac"" and the Brussels Sprouts with bacon and parmesan.What sets this restaurant apart from its peers is excellent service and hands on approach by Bruno, the man behind and in front of the curtain.  The first time I came to the restaurant, Bruno came and greeted me like an old friend.  He came at various points during the meal to check on our experience.  When he learned it was my birthday he wanted to buy me dessert, which apparently to him meant champagne and a entire dessert platter of samplings from the restaurant.  Then as if that weren't enough he bought me a glass of 18 year McClelland scotch.  Bruno then remembered me again when I came with family and again bought dessert.  With the latest outing even though it was a Living Social deal he told his hostess to seat us in a prime location and treated us as full paying customers.  That was after when I called to place a reservation, which Bruno himself picked up the phone to take, and gave me a choice reservation spot because he remembered that I had dined there before.  Bruno understands that the key to the restaurant experience is the atmosphere that is created and he is a master at ensuring a perfect dining experience because he treats customers like family and that is rare in this city.Bruno's wait staff keys off his lead.  I like the onion bread, so they always make sure to bring me fresh new onion bread.  My water and wine glass is never empty and I never have to search around for a waiter.  One time they overcooked a steak, slightly, but they immediately apologized and fixed it by bringing a brand new perfectly cooked steak.  Everyone makes mistakes, but for me a measure of excellence is how quickly and sincerely an effort is made to correct the mistake.Also a word about the Living Social deal, and service.  The deal was great, $75 for $150 of food.  The choices presented, though limited, were of some of the best choices of the menu (Steak Tartare, Bacon, Filet Mignon, Truffle Mac, Yukon Potatoes etc.)  They treated me like a regular full paying customer and devoted the same amount of time, effort and energy to my dining experience as they would anyone else.  I implore the people reading this review to also be mindful of that fact when it comes to the tip.  The deal creates enough value for you that you can afford to be generous with tip and urge you to do so.I will likely be going again very soon on another living social deal and after that on the regular full menu because I would rather give my money to a place that really values my business and makes a sincere effort to make the experience of eating there as pleasurable as it can get.",0,0,0,M J.,"New York, NY",1,4,0

I like that.The meal itself was great: calamari, canadian bacon, and onion rings for appetizers, filet mignon and steak for the main course with mac and cheese and cream spinach on the side, and tiramisu for dessert. Everything flowed very nicely: I was surprised how good their mac and cheese was despite this being such an upscale restaurant: sometimes a place can get too beyond simple dishes but not this one.

2.0,5/23/2012,"600+ reviews on Yelp and counting. Four and a half stars (higher than both Luger's and Keen's). I had never heard of this place prior to it suddenly coming up on my Yelp search for ""steak"" in New York City (trust that I search it frequently enough), and none of my prolific carnivorous friends on Yelp have reviewed it either. There is even a Living Social deal for this place being advertised on Yelp. Doesn't it all seem a little fishy to you?  The only thing to do of course was to go try it for ourselves. We had made same day reservations on a Friday for prime dinnertime (7:30) and while we were there half the dining room sat empty. The mystery continues. The atmosphere could be described as how someone who has never been to a fancy steakhouse might imagine a fancy steakhouse to be. Dim lights, white tablecloths, candles, single red roses, dark wood paneling. Not saying there's anything wrong with any of this, but in hindsight it does seem like someone was trying very hard. We suspended our doubts and ordered. The thick cut bacon that received so many rave reviews was not bad, but seemed a bit flavorless and kind of begged for the barbecue/ketchup-like dipping sauce it came with. Definitely not as good as Wolfgang's (*I still haven't been to Luger's). Okay, could be a fluke, let's wait for the steak. We shared the ""Prime Dry Aged Porterhouse"" for two. It was cooked to the right temperature (rare), and there was a nice crispy char on the outside, but -- I can hardly believe I'm saying this -- the meat itself had no flavor. I ate about a quarter of it before finally succumbing and using the additional barbecue/ketchup sauce they brought out with the steak (I think they called it their signature steak sauce). On the side we had brussels sprouts which were cooked to the point of being mushy and again, flavorless. It was all rather disheartening. We were perplexed. We wanted very much to have ""discovered"" a quality steakhouse that actually didn't cost quite as much as a quality steakhouse. Instead we got all the trappings of a steakhouse without any of the substance. Final verdict: Buyers beware.

2.0,5/17/2012,"Had a later reservation here during restaurant week a while back(a bit delayed on my review)Came here with my girlfriend for a anniversary dinner. Reviews seemed great, service sounded great and consistently people have said to come try it. And so I did. I made a reservation for 8pm. I made a reservation through open table as it was on my phone at work. Stated it was for an anniversary in my comments box and that was that. Arrived during our reservation time and was seated downstairs on the main level. I hear the upstairs was much better and intimate but we were placed in the back wall near 2 large groups of 5+ tourists. Not my ideal location and the hostess rushed off before we could say anything so I didn't make a fuss of it. We both opted for the pre-fix.Apps: Calamari and thick cut bacon. Calamari was good, a bit on the oily side and hot whilst the sauce was flavorful. Bacon was also good and well flavored. Main: My gf got the Salmon - she was not too impressed as it looked to be pale.  I got the filet in which it was good (I orderd it medium rare and it came out more so on the medium side. Sides: Good size,  we got the creamed spinach and mac n cheese - these were great. Tasted very good and hot. This is where the experience was ruined.Dessert: Cream puffs and Tiramisu. Tiramisu was good and creampuffs as well. In the middle of eating the bus boys took our plates away... when we didn't even finish our desserts (we literally just started eating it). I said to them we were not done... he said one second... and just took it anyway... we then got brand new empty plates? At this point I was thinking maybe it was something special since I indicated we were there for our anniversary? I was wrong, we ended up just sitting there for another 15mins. Our dessert was just taken from us like we were some children... I asked our waiter what happened and he said what do you mean they took it? He would look into it. Afterwards I didn't see him for another 10mins or so.  At this point I was just frustrated and wanted to check and to leave.A few things I noticed during our time here...- It seemed they were concerned with just turning over tables during restaurant week- Service was spotty. Very attentive in the beginning then impossible to get a hold of afterwards.Perhaps this type of service was like this bc it was during restaurant week. Who knows. But I will not be returning as it ruined a special occasion for me.",3,0,0,Tim K.,"Manhattan, NY",192,26,0

5.0,5/16/2012,"After my last visit, the owner Bruno messaged me and offered me his sympathies to my slightly less than spectacular service and also to return to his restaurant and how he would gladly give me the same livingsocial deal I had used on the previous occassion. What a sweet man... this is someone who truly cares about the quality and performance of his restaurant and this is what makes Club A so great. Though I did not take him up on his offer, I did return another 2 times (because the food is THAT amazing!) and they did not disappoint. Once was last week, my cousin and I were seated on the 2nd floor. It appears they have redecorated since the last time I've been up there, very red indeed but also very quiet and nice. It definitely has a more romantic feel with the upholstered seats and cushions, very fancy! I ordered what has turned into my usual staple when coming here, the canadian bacon, the filet mignon, potato puree, and the tiramisu (AND I got my coffee this time) and I enjoyed every single moment. BESTEST food EVER! I've also come to realize that it was mainly the white boyfriend putting ideas in my head about the seating arrangement, it just so happens that their clientele is 40% asian on any given night. I suppose us asians just flock to good food (and good deals). Haha. Sorry Club A for my previous post... I feel terrible about that.Yesterday's visit was a disaster though, through no fault of Club A. I made reservations for 5:45pm and the rest of my party was unbelievably tardy to the point it was embarrassing.... they ended up showing up an hour late. Thanks family... you never cease to disappoint me and mess up my birthday. But Club A so very kindly still managed to fit us in on their super busy evening (which they made clear when I made the reservation a week ago) and I really, reallyyy appreciate that. What amazing service! The owner Bruno even gave us complimentary lobster ravioli which is as delicious as everything else I've tried on their menu. Thank you Club A for all your wonderful hospitality and good graces... and ultimately saving what was turning out to be a pretty terrible birthday.

5.0,5/15/2012,"Went with the Living Social deal.  First stop was the bar where the sassy bartender Christina told me they were closed before smiling a second later and asking me what I wanted.  This type of service with personality was consistent and welcome throughout the entire meal.Place was quite nice to look at.  The downstairs area was indeed quite red a la Striphouse but without the overt attempt to be sexy.  I dined upstairs with a buddy which was also a really nice room.  Ambience was enhanced by a bass/organ combo on the ground floor whose music was piped in upstairs.The LivingSocial deal cannot be beat and even though we were getting a deal, they treated us exactly as if we were paying full price.  We enjoyed a caesar salad and very thick-cut canadian bacon to start, rivalling any of the other steakhouses.  Then we each got a 10 oz Filet medium rare, cooked perfectly mind you, along with creamed spinach and garlic fries.  The food was delicious and genuinely holds its own with the other top steakhouses in the city (trying to compare/contrast between all of the excellent restaurants is simply a fruitless and wasteful exercise - just know that it's good).  Yes, I wish I had been able to order the porterhouse but we were getting a great deal as is so no complaints.  Both the creampuffs and tiramisu to close went down very well.Also, ordered a bottle of the Grgich Hills ($95) that was spectacular.  They decanted it in a beautiful tall snake-like decanter and kept our glasses filled throughout.And again, the service.  From the busboy to the waiter (who recommended the wine after we gave him a choice of a few) to, finally, Bruno himself who came over a couple times to ask how things were and talk about his restaurant (at our prodding).  A warm figure who takes pride in his business and enjoys seeing his customers happy, you cannot help but root for him and Club A.Club A has officially entered my rotation on steakhouses and I'll certainly be back.",0,0,0,Frank N.,"Manhattan, NY",85,30,7
5.0,5/14/2012,"The husband and I have been here twice for dinner already, and food is consistently good. Steaks are cooked to order, appetizers are good portions, and desserts are simply stunning... stunning because I'm usually too full to walk, and cannot finish it.Apps: tried the calamari both times. crispy, hot, delicious. the marinara sauce side has a bit of kick to it, so that's pretty awesome in my book for not being just a tomato puree. hubby always gets the thick cut canadian bacon - he loves the saltiness of it. I'm not such a big fan unless there's oodles of water around but wait... water service is great, so I guess I do like it after all.Mains: Filet mignon. What are you here for, really? The MEAT. Medium rare is cool in the center, bleeding enough to mix into your creamed spinach to say mmmmmm. Bearnaise sauce? Sure. it's got a sweeter flavor than most bearnaises I've had (yes, I have made this at home from package and scratch, mind you), and it's very nice.Sides: good portions, not tiny like at Strip House. Truffle oil creamed spinach and mac n cheese were both fantastic -- hint hint mix it up and you get ooey gooey goodness.Dessert: Cream puffs. You get 3 big ones. Tiramisu. You get a big square.

4.0,4/25/2012,"OK. Here's the thing: I have been to this place four or five times. But I have never paid a dime. Because of some coincidences, always someone else has picked up the tab. (Now, don't get me wrong, I am not some freeloader. Actually, I feel comfortable when I know I am the one paying. In that case I can freely go for the most expensive dish or wine. When someone else is paying, I don't like to look as if I try not to go nuts with the menu. It may all be in my head, but that's how I am.)OK, now why I am explaining all this? The thing is that when you don't pay your judgment is a bit less sharpened. Isn't it the same with you guys (read: imaginary readers of my review?) I loved it here. The food was always delicious and (Bruno?) the owner, always a gentleman. I usually go for the fish, but I have loved the soups and appetizers as well. The place is nice and once I was in the second floor for a private group dining. Now what I want to know is did I really liked this place or was I being too relaxed, because it was not on my dime so what the hell...The only way to know is to go there and have a go by myself and make a more trusted evaluation.

We had an enormous amount of food for $35 (two appetizers, two entrees, two sides, and two desserts). The service was still exceptional that night. Marks a good restaurant, that wants it customers to come back ...The decor is classy and intimate with lots of red. There is a downstairs and an upstairs with a bar. I have only sat upstairs, but I love the window with the bamboo growing around it. They have a very extensive wine list ranging from reasonably priced to high end. I have found a very nice Rhone on the menu that costs about $48. They will decant the wine for you in crazy, handmade decanters that are sure to be a topic of conversation. Personally, I let the waiter poor the wine as I am not going to be responsible for breaking the very unique, expensive decanter. In terms of food, everything I've had is very well prepared.  - The extra thick bacon is to die for, but also might be the cause of your death (I certainly recommend sharing).  - The calamari is another good choice for an appetizer.  - The filet mingnon was cooked perfectly to my liking.  - For sides get the creamed spinach and mac and cheese.

4.0,4/23/2012,"Club A Steakhouse is hard to review. I took advantage of a living social promotion (apparently, they are one of living social's largest customers) and for the price I paid I had a really great meal. The hard part of the review, however, is deciding whether I'd come back at full price.I'd really have to nitpick to find anything wrong with the meal. The restaurant is tastefully decorated; the color red is the predominate theme but it's tastefully done (even down to the thin, red accent mattes in black and white photos on the walls). On the night we attended there was also live Jazz music, which added to the ambiance. Service by and large was good, although for reasons unknown we were switched to a different waiter midway through the meal (I normally wouldn't mind this, but I'd prefer the new waiter to at least introduce himself). One big advantage of living social and similar promotions is the chance to eat a full, multi-course meal and by and large all the courses were very good. The Canadian bacon slice (you get just one slice as an appetizer, but it's huge) was very flavorful; my wife's Caesar salad was also very good. I ordered the 10oz filet medium rare, it was perhaps the only disappointment, and only a minor disappointment at that. Because it was a smaller cut it meant that having a medium rare center (still just a bit red) entailed the outside of the meat being cooked to medium or even medium well. There was one really delicious bite right in the center; the rest of the filet was good but not quite as memorable. Overall it certainly wasn't a bad steak, but I don't think it would even make the top ten of the steaks I've had in NYC.  The desserts (cream puffs or tiramisu; my wife and I shared one of each) were also very good.At that's where the trouble in reviewing this place - everything was very good, at the only complaints would really just be nit picking. The problem is that without the promotion this place isn't cheap; it's among the most expensive steak houses in the city; at menu prices I'd really expect a meal that was exceptional, and while this place was very good, it wasn't memorably exceptional. If you can find a promotional deal for the restaurant definitely take advantage of it; you won't be disappointment. If not, Club A certainly isn't a bad choice, but there are better (as well as cheaper) steaks available elsewhere.",1,0,0,Jon L.,"Forest Hills, NY",67,151,32

First, the decor is very romantic, done in shades of red with velvet, which totally works, along with a candle and rose on every table. Bring your date here if you want to impress her!We sat upstairs, which offers nice views out the windows. The steak portions we got were very large, the filet alone was 16 ounces, which is certainly larger than usual. We also got the NY strip and both were outstanding and cooked to order, which seems to be a lost art. The owner also gave us an appetizer portion of lobster ravioli, which was very good. The wine pour was also very generous, easily two pours in other places.The most outstanding part was when I mentioned it was my birthday They brought out 2 glasse of wine, a desert plate with tiramisu and carrot cake and also a HUGE fresh fruit tower (not just a plate with strawberries). This is more than I think I've recieved in my past birthdays combined.The only disappointment were the french fries, which were under cooked and the baked potato, which came out luke warm. To its credit, they replaced both and took them off the bill and also gave me more wine while I waited for the replacements to come out.I strongly recommend Club A and will also go there again anytime I'm in NYC!",1,0,1,Howard L.,"Chicago, IL",61,152,12

5.0,4/16/2012,"Feeling baller and craving steak, I surprised the special man in my life with a date night here. Club A Steakhouse delivered on a romantic yet casual atmosphere with food that made love to our taste buds.The restaurant is big with bars and tables over two levels. By the front, a 2 man jazz band will strum your appetite into hunger. The decor is chic and walls are filled pictures of the owner and friends.For appetizers, we each got a slice of their Canadian Bacon. All bacon should come like this! It was to die for! It was thick, juicy and fatty (that's what she said). It came with a condiment that was a sweet type of ketchup that complimented the bacon perfectly.For entrees, I ordered the Filet Mignon (med-rare of course) and he had the NY Strip Steak (medium). Both meats were cooked to the right temperature and were very hunky pieces of juicy heaven. What impressed me was the variety of sauces that came with the steaks and their Au Poivre sauce was divine. That peppery tang was evident but subtle so that it wouldn't overpower the plain deliciousness of your steak.For sides, we shared the Creamed Spinach and received complimentary Mash Potatoes on the side. I usually prefer my Creamed Spinach a little more on creamy spectrum but given how full I was getting from my huge steak, I liked that Club A's version focused more on the texture of the spinach than the heaviness of the cream itself.The prices of the wine by glass was very reasonable and they have a great variety. My glass of Merlot was perfect for my meal.The service here is stellar. We were never rushed despite how busy it was and I always appreciate when waiters check on me throughout my dining experience.

4.0,4/14/2012,"We went back after being contacted by Bruno, and we had quite a wonderful time, a complete 180 from our first experience.  It was such a nice gesture, thank you Bruno!  A few highlights:~Maryland crabcake (4.5 stars): absolutely the crab meat-iest crab cake I've had yet.  Full of actual, slightly sweet and very fresh crab, with a perfectly crispy outer shell.  The salad it came with balanced it out very nicely.~Porterhouse for two (5 stars): half filet mignon, half sirloin, all perfectly seared and absolutely tender, medium rare on the side of rare.  Obviously, if you come here, the steak is definitely the star, and they know how to do their steaks.  I'd probably just get the filet next time, but the sirloin was also some of the most tender I've had.~Broccoli rabe (4 stars): cooked just right with a great deal of garlic.  I wish they'd packed that for us with the rest of our meal though, since I'd eaten so much I couldn't finish it.~Lobster ravioli (4 stars): deliciously plump with lobster!  The sauce was a bit on the saltier side, but it was so good I almost mopped it up with bread.Service was wonderful.  There was always at least one server in the room we were in, and they even came by to serve us more steak if they noticed that our shared plates were nearing empty.  Even though the restaurant was pretty full, they didn't rush us at all, and Bruno came by a few times to check up on us.All in all, this was really a wonderful experience.  If you are looking to have a great steak with a beautiful ambience and fantastic service, this is it.",0,0,0,Jiahui L.,"Manhattan, NY",32,369,41

We had a living social deal that didn't come with wine but gave us an exception house wine for $20 a bottle of Cabernet. The food was delicious where the filet Mignon and sides melt in your mouth.

4.0,4/11/2012,"K, went back again for dinner. Same good food, however I am going to take back my tip from last time and recommend you to sit downstairs.Reason: just a little background info: My family owns some stores and my father always insists on making every customer feel special. Here at Club A, you get exactly that. For the second time, we were greeted by the owner himself, and taken to our seat. He came upstairs couple of times and again made sure everything was going smooth and I find that VERY CLASSY.HOWEVER, everytime that this gentleman would go downstairs, so would the service. Our waiters would just stand around and chit chat, and as soon as the Owner would come back up, you could see the waiters getting their act together and wallah! service is top notch again.We didnt complain cause for most part, everything was going smooth. However there were a couple of times that we had to sit around for couple minutes to make that eye contact with our server, and we were the only ones upstairs!However, dont let this get in your way of going here, I say it again, having tried most other steakhouses in the city, this is Bang On the best in NYC.",0,0,0,Yashar Y.,"Newark, NJ",73,94,5
5.0,4/10/2012,"I took my boyfriend here for our two year anniversary. Fantastic Ambiance. It's very romantic. Had some live music in the background. Every table with a candle and dim lit. We arrived 15 minutes early for our reservation. We were accommodated quickly. The service was great. They were very attentive and I think my water got refilled 5 times. They're very quick and attentive. The food was great. We shared the porterhouse steak. Tasted great. It's sizzling hot when brought to you and they serve it to your plate. It pretty much melted in my mouth. I had the mac & cheese and the fries. Both were delicious as well.What I really loved was how at the end, when I got my bill, a complimentary dessert that said, ""Happy 2nd Anniversary,"" arrived a few minutes after I had already paid. I made a special request for an anniversary plate & without having anything said, I did not have to worry. It blew me away. And the manager was extremely nice. He offered to take a picture of me and my boyfriend and told us how he just celebrated his 37th anniversary, It was so sweet.My only negative comment on this place was the person who took my order. He was a little rude. I was deciding on what to order and I felt his negative aura on me and when I saw his face (looking all annoyed) I stuttered ordering my food. How embarrassing. But overall, 5 stars. I'm not going to take off a star for that one employee. It'd be different if it was all the employees. But GREAT JOB Clubhouse.

1.0,4/9/2012,"After reading all the great reviews here, my wife and I decided to give the Club A Steakhouse a visit during our weekend trip to NYC (we're from Maryland). After the visit, I left wondering how this place could possibly be rated so high. We arrived at the restaurant right on time for our reservations at 7 PM on a Saturday and were seated in one of the tables in the upstairs dining area. Apart from us and a large party by the window, the entire floor was empty...which seemed odd for a place that's supposed to serve such great food.Throughout the meal, the service was ok but there was nothing really special about it. We got the shrimp cocktail as an appetizer which again was just ok. But then things really started to go downhill with the main course. I got the dry aged rib eye medium rare and my wife the filet mignon medium, along with a loaded baked potato and the creamed spinach. My rib eye was tough and stringy with excessive amounts of fat, whereas my wife's filet was dried out and flavorless. We really could have gotten better steaks at Outback for $20. I don't have any comments about the baked potato but the creamed spinach...oh it was quite disgusting. My wife and I both took one bite and we looked at each other thinking the same thing. The only way to describe the flavor of it was to compare it to say that it tasted like certain bodily fluids.From reading other reviews, I can only conclude that our poor experience was an aberration, maybe a disgruntled kitchen employee or a bad batch of meat from the supplier...but with so many other great steakhouses in NYC, I can say with certainty that I'll never be going back to find out.",2,0,0,Chris L.,"Laurel, MD",0,4,0
5.0,4/9/2012,"Food was delicious, service was great!Only hiccup was that when someone in my party asked for their meat to be cooked ""Rare +"" aka in between rare and medium rare, the staff acted confused and proclaimed that it couldn't be cooked that way however they suggested that if the meat wasn't cooked to our liking, it could be sent back and cooked for a little bit longer (which is what happened).All in all, the food was delicious and the atmosphere was great.

2.0,4/8/2012,"*please read my previous reviews now since this is an update* My first visit was OK at 3 stars...My second visit was excellent at 5 stars...My most recent visit?!?  Read on...Back in October I saw a LivingSocial deal: Three-Course Steak Dinner ($69) or Lunch ($49) for Two.  I decided to buy two of the lunch vouchers as it would be a chance to return to Club A while catching up with 3 friends.  Since I'm not living in NYC anymore and have been way too busy traveling on business trips, I had BFF J call in last week for a reservation.  She informed me the reservation was set for 7 on Saturday and it surprised me since we had lunch vouchers and all.  BFF J said they were extremely accommodating as the person she spoke to said they wouldn't be busy at all.  So yesterday we went with TL & SL and they seated us promptly.  But a few minutes later, the maitre 'd approached me and said my vouchers were for lunch and they were only serving dinner at this time.  This would result in an extra $20 charge per voucher since dinner portions would be larger.  Since I had BFF J make the reservation, I figured she forgot to mention how we had lunch vouchers.  I agreed because of that and it's not like we had much of a choice with being seated already.  Here's what I ordered:1.  steak tartare:  it was OK, but I was a little underwhelmed as the flavors weren't as refreshing as my first visit.  2.  Canadian bacon:  always good at a mere $5 a slab (BFF J's favorite)3.  hanger steak:  I ordered it rare and thought it was OK4.  mac & cheese:  I don't know why i keep ordering this at restaurants in hopes of a life-altering experience.  Always skip the mac & cheese wherever you go and just make it at home....5.  tiramisu:  nice flavor and good ratio of layersIn regards to the service, it was off...1.  the cappuccino episode:  Because of the LivingSocial deal, we were asked to order our appetizers, entrees, sides, and desserts from the beginning.  Everyone made their orders without a problem except for SL.  When he ordered his tiramisu for dessert, he also asked for a cappuccino.  I thought SL was being very sharp and doing the waiter a favor by ordering everything at once.  But the waiter gave him an uninterested glance and abruptly said the cappuccino order would be taken later.  I considered the exchange to be very rude.2.  the tiramisu episode:      So we each ordered 4 plates of tiramisu in advance.  When our desserts were served, we were instead presented with 4 plates of cream puffs.  They looked nice, but too bad it wasn't what we ordered.  Maybe if SL's order was taken specifically from the start, they would have remembered we had ordered 4 plates of tiramisu with an annoying cappuccino.  But I'm just speculating here...So why the harsh two star rating?  During dinner, BFF J mentioned how she didn't understand why we were being charged an extra $40 because when she made the reservation, she explicitly said we were using the lunch vouchers from LivingSocial.  She had a good point and it became apparent it was not our fault as to why we had lunch vouchers for a 7pm dinner.  At the end of dinner, I mentioned my dissatisfaction to the maitre 'd of what transpired, but it fell upon deaf ears.  He kept reiterating how l had lunch vouchers and that I had agreed to the $40 surcharge for dinner.  But I hope my fellow Yelpers realize that BFF J EXPLICITLY made a reservation with full disclosure of our LUNCH VOUCHERS and they AGREED to a 7pm DINNER.  Sure we ate dinner portions, but I am absolutely puzzled as to why we were in such a predicament to begin with!  Because of this, we will not be returning as there are plenty of other places to check out in Manhattan when I'm back in NYC...",0,0,0,Harvey C.,"New York, NY",84,273,2290

5.0,4/1/2012,"A-mazing!  Yelp did not disappoint, as I was looking for a steakhouse to check out here in New York.  Having gone to a dozen or so steak restaurants in Chicago, I was used to having excellent service - but this place really tops the cake!  I felt like my boyfriend and I were slightly underdressed as we both were in jeans, though my boyfriend did have on a blazer.  The place felt comfortable and intimate.  I like the simple touches of the single rose and the white candlestick. The red walls make the place feel cozy and warm.  We figured that we'd be full with our entree so we skipped the appetizer and yet received a complimentary potato pancake appetizer.  We had gotten the Mixed Grill for two since I wanted to try a lot of things, and this included the New York strip, veal, lamb chops, and sausages.  We did get mashed potatoes on the side along with the brussell sprouts with bacon and parmesan.  The meat was juicy and flavorful and our side dishes were tasty as well.  Our waiter had recommended the chocolate mousse and it was perfect!  It was the right amount of decadence but yet light enough to not feel so heavy.  The owner had come by to ask us how things were and wanted to buy us a drink, but we were already so stuffed.  After we had refused that, the waiter brought by a platter of one of the most extravagant fruit dishes I had ever seen.  I had to send this back because there was no way I could eat it.  I would have finished all the meat, wine and the rest of the chocolate mousse if I had any additional room in my stomach.  The staff there were so attentive, friendly, and great with the recommendations.  The prices were affordable and the overall experience was memorable.  I highly recommend making a reservation and coming here again!",0,0,0,Leang E.,"Chicago, IL",436,2114,560

Reservations are a must here, the place was packed on a tuesday night(we still had to wait about 20 minutes with it). The second floor is the place to dine, you may even get lucky and be seated by the large glass window with a nice street view.  The bacon appetizer was great, charred enough to get a nice blend of crisped fat ans well as meat. A must try.The filet mignon was simple and delicious. The skirt steak was overcooked and did not have the best flavor. As for the sides, creamed spinach was just okay,not to be compared with other more ""famous"" versions. Potatoes were standard. Wine was served in large glass almost whimsical decanter. While we waited we too did receive the complimentary lobster ravioli and 2 plump shrimps in cocktail sauce.Cream puffs are the dessert to try,light and velvety. We also were given a small plate of mini desserts on the house. The owner was very attentive to all and treated us to a round of drinks on the house.

3.0,3/29/2012,"While on a trip to NYC, found Club A on yelp and because of the reviews we decided to go. The service was good. They had numerous people checking if we needed water or anything else, but after the food was delivered, no one asked how the food was. I started with a lobster cocktail which was ok. It was a good size portion (half of a full lobster), but any lobster that has barnacles growing on it is not fresh and it had a bad after taste. They did bring out some lobster ravioli complements of the chef which were pretty good. Then the entree's... because we were in NYC I ordered the NY strip while my wife had the half lemon thyme chicken. The steak was a large portion which I thought was awesome. However, being from California where I am use to Tri-tip and carne asada which are very flavorful, the steak was tasteless. No flavor, no juice, no nothing. I normally love steak, but I only ate half my meal. My wife did enjoy her chicken. We also ordered the creamed spinach, which was good and they brought out some mashed potatoes complements of chef which were really good! Overall I have to say that Club A was ok, but for the price, should have been much better. The people who say this is a great restaurant probably have not been to many good steak houses and to give 4 or 5 stars to a restaurant with a B health rating is crazy!

5.0,3/26/2012,"This is one of the best restaurants in the city in my opinion. I was especially  surprised to find this in the otherwise barren restaurant land known as midtown east. This place had a ""fancy"" vibe and the service was top notch, but I got no feeling of pretentiousness when I viewed the menu, saw the prices and tasted food.For starters I had the Caesar salad, crab cakes and Canadian bacon/ham. The salad was of noticeably higher quality and taste, and the crab cakes were big and rich. I can recommend both, and I would probably order both again, but the ham stole the show. For five bucks, you don't just get a ""strip"" of Canadien bacon, you get a legitimate half inch thick steak that's flavorful and juicy.Moving on from there I got the lamb chops, which were top notch. It was exactly the quality you'd expect from this restaurant. By the time dessert rolled around I was in quite the food coma, which makes any details on that course a bit foggy, but from what I remember it was great as well.All in all I can recommend this restaurant to anybody staying in New York.

I am not a big fan of the chain steakhouses and I have been to some of the best of those. The atmosphere/decor was more for a couple than the traditional steakhouse (masculine).

The place is clean, dim lit, and at a perfect temperature.The service was top of the line, it really does not get better unless they sit there and feed you.

The servers will make sure you have a great dinning experience. The FOOD: I had a steak of course and she had a seafood dish. The steak was probably the best I have had but it is difficult to say, I have been blessed with great steaks in my short life. The steak is dry aged and you can taste the flavors in ever bite. They have a homemade steak sauce which is good but you do not need it. The fries were great and the onion rings we even better.

I made reservations for a table of 6 which wasn't needed cuz the place wasn't crowded at all! They also had a 2 man crew Jazz band to set the romantic & passive mood. I ordered the porterhouse steak for 2 medium well & it was like BUTTA... Served to perfection! However, what caught me off guard was the seafood sampler platter. OMG... It was AMAZING! The platter includes Lobster tails, Claws & sweat lump Crab meat which makes my mouth water just thinking about it as I write this. Lol I also tried their famous Canadian thick sliced bacon which was also delicious & a must try when you order. I was a little puzzled cuz at the end of dinner they brought out a full tray of tiramisu & cream puffs for everyone at my table for FREE! Maybe it was the $700 I dropped at dinner but either way dessert was delicious too! So, the moral of my story is the food, staff, service, ambiance was 5 Stars!

They took incredibly good care of us, down to all the little details. I've often found that using vouchers can decrease the level of service you receive, but that was definitely not the case here. They did an amazing job of being incredibly attentive, yet never seeming to be in the way or there too often. On the second occasion, they even gave us an additional appetizer, side dish, and dessert--all complimentary. (It was St. Patrick's Day, so maybe not as many people went out for steak dinners that night?) We both had filet mignon, wich was excellent. Truffled creamed spinach was great. as was the (also truffled) mac 'n cheese. One reviewer complained of soggy cream puffs, which surprised me. I'm actually not a fan of cream-filled things, but these were quite good--not too sweet, nice & light, and definitely NOT soggy. They must've been there on an ""off"" day, or something.

A couple people at our table got the filet, we ordered a hamburger, the hangar steak, the short ribs and a strip steak. For sides we shared the creamed spinach, the 5 cheese truffle Mac n cheese, the broccoli rabe, the Brussel sprouts and a side of mashed potatoes purée. First of all, it was all great, but the filet was by far my favorite. They offer a 16oz filet on the menu, but you can ask for the 10 oz petit filet which was way more than I even needed. The sides were all good, but the potato purée was my favorite and the sauce on the brussel sprouts was my least favorite, although still tasty. We shared bottles of pinot noir (cant remember which one, but it was really good).  For dessert we had were celebrating a birthday, so the restaurant served us tiriamisu - so yummy.

4.0,3/15/2012,"Was I impressed....no... Normally I really look forward to NY steak houses but I don't know if it was the initial feeling when I walked in the door or what it was. I like the cool red decor for a steak house, it different. I liked it. The breakdown:Expect to pay appx $100+ per personDress attire: Many people were dressed up but equally people in jeans with nice shirts and shoes. Only saw one or two people wearing sneakers and it did look out of place. Reservations: Definitely make reservations because it gets packed quickly and the tiny bar gets backed up too with walkin's. Staff: I was expecting top notch service there and to be wow'd from all the other reviewers... I wasn't, I had better service at mortons and even outback! They weren't bad but I wouldn't even think of complimenting them. To me their job is to be of service, guidance and advice. I asked a couple of questions about their signature dishes and any recommendations. I had better feedback from the staff at outback. Again, not to knock them down, but with this kind of steak house, they need to know the menu like the back of their hand and also talk about what is what. I still give the waiter an A for service but a C on being helpful with recommendations.Food: Prime Aged Porter House for 2: At $94, I think the flavor from the meat was good but I don't like when my steak comes out precut. Its 40oz, comes out precut in slices on a searing hot cast iron/metal platter so you can continue to cook your meat. This I would never get again. 16oz Filet Mignon: $47? This was the award winning steak, perfect crispy sear and medium rare edge to edge. The flavor, cooking and size is perfect. I couldn't believe it was 16oz, but with something this good... Why not.. Absolutely A+ all the way.Prime Aged Double Eagle Cut NY Strip 24oz with bone: $53, This was recommended by the waiter when I asked him. As for the sear and flavor of the meat, it was a A+, my only gripe with the meat was that I didn't like the texture and how tough it was. NY strip is obviously tougher than filet mignon, but I didn't like it. It was tough and chewy. I would never get this again. Not bad, but wouldn't.Sides: The german hash brown had decent flavor but was way to salty and not crispy. Truffle oil mac and cheese was tasty, but they really didn't give much for a side... It was pretty tiny. Overall I think the apps and sides from mortons are a lot better, Overall.. I would go back only to get the bacon slice I forgot to order, a filet mignon and a new side. I wouldn't get the deserts or apps there. I would say if you are in the mood for a steak house, definitely try them out. I was also intrigued but wondered how they can charge $30 for a burger.. I debated on trying it but not that night.",4,2,2,Phoenix X.,"New York, NY",338,220,29

2.0,3/2/2012,"2.5 * and disappointed enough to avoid going backIn all fairness, a single episode is just a slice in time, but then again I decided before I went in that I would be writing a review as I was excited to try this 500+ reviewed 4* restaurantIn the realm of expensive steak dinners;  Manhattan is probably sitting with few cities with regards to competition. This means to me that everything has to be good and the quality and char of the steak go without saying......this was not the case on my visit.  I always try to go in with an open mind and role with any imperfections as to ensure my pleasant experiences.  It was hard to justify my nearly 3 hr dining experience, not slowed on my account.  On arrival our table was not ready, which I actually dont care about...but after 10 minutes I decided it would be appropriate to just grab a couple of drinks from the crowded bar while we continued to wait...10 minutes later and feeling like the bartended actually tried to avoid making eye contact with me... I was getting antsy. About to make myself known, a server placed a glass unevenly near the register which tipped and fell shattering on the counter near the ice... I was happy to see the bartender frustrated as she was,start to empty the ice- ""well done!"" I thought, but then she stopped at about the half-way mark, as if there was some invisible glass barrier that would keep the rest of the ice safe!  So nix the drinks and wait for seating.I was happy to see that we were eventually seated upstairs where there was an assumed  uncontaminated bar, YES!! I could still get a glass-free vodka soda :)Bread was good, appetizer took a bit, but the Calamari did come out nicely crisp with a pretty tasty sauce. About 45 minutes later the steaks and sides came out...Forgotten about- maybe. But what counts is that they're perfect right?perfect as a square peg  and round hole, my medium rare beef was at least 2 options too far and just below well done. Accidents happen, I understand that. The disheartening part was when I asked if that was actually medium rare and the server pointed out the pink tag on the steak and telling me, obviously yes.  Again to be fair, I pointed out that it was far overdone, which they eventually agreed with and offered to make another; unwilling to invest another 45 minutes of cooking, I declined. They instead comp'd our drinks (which had no glass fragments).  In addition to the dessert we ordered they also gave us complimentary canolli - which I was too full to eat. OVERALL:an unremakable eh... wouldn't spend another 3 hrs here or risk an esophageal laceration; there are far too many places in Manhattan ensuring that you have an overall great experience at this price point.",1,1,1,Doc H.,"San Francisco, CA",4,32,29

5.0,2/28/2012,"I absolutely love steak. So it's no surprise that I also love steakhouses. They are quite literally houses of steak. What's not to love? Well, if you ask my girlfriend (and apparently other women)...a lot. If she is to be believed (an admittedly big ""if"", considering her obviously questionable judgment), most places like Keen's and Luger's are boys' clubs dripping with testosterone, and they don't really cater to the fairer sex. If your lady happens to feel the same way, bring her to Club A. With multiple fireplaces, live music, candles illuminating the red walls and the most accommodating, charming owners anywhere, this is the date steakhouse. This is the first steakhouse that I would classify as truly romantic. And not just romantic for me -- because I actually do find sharing 30 oz of bloody meat romantic -- but romantic even for her. In addition to such inviting ambiance, the meal is perfectly paced. You never feel as though you are waiting for anything, nor do you feel rushed. The service also is impeccable; every server and busboy reflects the courtesy and old-world hospitality of the owners. And of course, the food is excellent. The calamari is amazing, the shrimp cocktail huge and fresh. The Caesar salad is as good as it gets, and the filet is beautifully cooked. My osso bucco was tender as can be, and the risotto it's served over was unsurprisingly excellent, given the Italian roots of the restaurant.

5.0,2/24/2012,"I decided to give Club A Steakhouse another chance since the food was delicious on my first visit and the ambiance was 5 stars. This time around, I felt as though I was treated like a queen! The level of service my dining partner and I received was really amazing. We got sat at a huge booth seat that could fit 6 people at the table, and we had it all to ourselves. It was as though our booth was designed to have front row seats to the floor to ceiling windows that overlooked the beautiful scenic trees outside that were decorated with lights. It was a very pretty site. We had wine, and it was served in this very unique snake shape pourer. Every time our waiter refilled our glasses, it was exciting to watch because it came out of a snake and he had to keep twisting it as it got emptier. I kind of wonder where they bought this pourer, because I kind of want one for a future wine and cheese party of my own! Very ingenious and creative design. To start, we had the Sizzling Canadian Bacon. This was served in a big thick slab. It was so good! I actually have never had bacon like this before, and am only used to having the kind that is served at brunch that is thin and crispy. This kind was juicy, full of flavor, and something that I had never tasted before! My dining partner happens to be slightly obsessed with bacon, and confirmed that this bacon was top notch! For our meal, we had the Porterhouse for Two and it was huge! We asked for it to be cooked Medium Rare, and it definitely was cooked to our request. The meat came out sizzling on the plate and was served to us. It was also accompanied by various dipping sauces which added excitement and experimentation to the meal. I am also the biggest lover of sauces! So that practically made the meal for me. But to be honest, the meat was seasoned so well and cooked just the way I like it, that the sauce wasn't even necessary, but definitely an asset. I definitely had to bring home leftovers of the  porterhouse because there was enough there for 4 people! For sides, we ordered the Mac and Cheese and the Yukon Potato Puree. The mac and cheese was sooooooo good. It was extremely creamy and loaded with flavor. I also loved the touch of crispness on the top layer that added the extra texture to each bite.The potato puree was buttery and delicious. I love butter, so this made me so happy! The potatoes were blended together into a very soft puree that was extremely delicate and packed with flavor.  For dessert we had two desserts to share. We had the tiramisu and the cream puffs. The tiramisu I preferred over the cream puffs because of the moistness of the cake and the delicious flavor of expresso. The cream puffs were also very good, but so creamy! They were definitely genuinely an italian delight, but I am more of a chocolate girl than a cream girl :) Luckily my dining partner ate more of the cream puffs, while I over indulged with the tiramisu. I highly suggest you visit Club A Steakhouse. I think the first time I went, it must have been an off night with the service.

Definitely would be a great venue for a date so long as your partner is a meat eater. We ordered the Calamari as an appetizer and the mixed grill (filet, lamb, pork chops, and hot and sweet sausage - all medium rare. The calamari was good but nothing spectacular. The meat, however, was incredible and on par with Sparks, Capital Grill, Bobby Vann's etc if not better. However, the best part was that we were sent two side orders on the house.

Club A Steakhouse had stellar reviews, plenty of options and the perfect east side location.  We started with canadian bacon and caesar salad appetizers. I had to try this thick cut bacon that everyone talks about! The smoky flavor was incredible...

4.0,2/19/2012,"I got a Yelp deal last year and finally got around to using it on the last day the deal was good for. My first impression of the class was that this was the vibe of the place is really relaxing and romantic. The owner was super nice and led us to a table upstairs it seemed that the upstairs was filled with couples. After reading so many reviews about this place I think I had very high expectations especially about the service and since so many people talked about all the complimentary food they got. I have to say that my experience turned out like a lot of my fellow yelpers. Our waiter was very nice and attentive. To start my bf ordered the steak tartare and I calamari. I really liked the calamari, it was not rubbery like in most places and be warned that their portions are huge. I was so busy eating the calamari that I did not even try the steak tartare. For my entree I had the hanger steak and we ordered the mac and cheese and garlic fries. After finishing the appetizers we were brought out a complimentary shrimp cocktail and this was really good. After that we were also given the lobster ravioli and that was unbelievable. I think is actually very smart of this place to bring out these complimentary samples since it allows the customer to sample other items on the menu and it made me want to go back and order some of these items. My hanger steak was done perfectly medium rare and it came with a peppercorn sauce that was wonderful. My bf ordered the Ossobuco and he wolfed it down really quick so I guess it must have been good. My only disappointment was with the sides, the mac and cheese was OK but that's it. The garlic fries were so bland and just meh that I kept eating them to see if I could discover some hidden flavor but sadly that did not happen. The fries had absolutely no taste to them, just to give you an idea of how lacking in the flavor department these fries were I did something I've never done before and that was to reach for the salt shaker. I tried adding salt but it really didn't even help. We just gave up on the fries. Despite the side situation I really enjoyed this place and the Yelp deal was a great value.

3.0,2/17/2012,"I took my husband here for a belated Valentine's dinner. I am a vegetarian and he braved a vegan restaurant for me last year, so it was my turn to take one for the team. Upon arriving, I really liked the atmosphere of Club A. Dim lighting, candles on the tables, not too crowded - very romantic. We were led upstairs and I was a little turned off by the fact that we were seated at a table for two in between two other couples. The seating is just too close to keep that truly romantic vibe going (we could hear every word of their conversations). But we did our best to block out those around us and focus on each other.Service started out great and we were immediately brought a basket of yummy bread (the onion bread was amazing) and our drinks. I ordered a salad to start and it was very good. For dinner, I had got the 3 sides for $24 and picked a baked potato, the truffle mac and steamed broccoli. My husband got the 16 oz filet with a side of garlic fries. We were both really happy with our food, but the clear standout was the truffle mac. I'm not even a huge fan of truffle oil, but it was just so, so good in this dish! I'm a big fan of leftovers and ate just enough (and kept fending off my husband's fork) to have at least half to take home. We got our extra food wrapped up and the table was cleared. Then we waited. And waited. And waited. We wanted to order coffee and dessert, but our waiter just completed disappeared! My husband finally flagged down a busser and got us dessert menus. Once we'd made our choice (we split the Tartuffo), we had to flag someone down again to place the order. After such great service at the beginning of the meal, it was disappointing that it changed gears so quickly.Anyway, we paid our bill and got home and I started to put the leftovers in the fridge. My heart SANK when I saw that the leftover truffle mac was nowhere to be found! There had definitely been enough left that it was obvious we wanted it boxed... so disappointing!

4.0,2/17/2012,"Every few years the latest and greatest take on reconstructing the classic steakhouse comes along.  Most are quickly flagged as being too distant from the notion of an enjoyable place to drop a small fortune on a stellar experience.  Like it or not, there are boundaries which evolve much more slowly than do the creative impulses of steakhouse restaurateurs.  The difference is more than subtle; it is the difference between successfully hailing a cab on Eighth Ave. versus volunteering to become a human hood ornament.Club A may have tweaked the classic formula just enough to be unique.  It starts with the atmosphere; elegant, intimate, inviting and comfortable.  Machismo-fueled ""beef cave"" fans may not immediately connect with the Club A vision, and while it is a bit of an acquired taste, the relaxed feel is nice.  I get it.The owner of this vision is a true gentleman named Bruno.  He will greet you as you enter, and instruct his highly-trained staff to pamper your culinary desires.  The mix of comfortable setting and over-the-top service is absolutely wonderful.  The impression given is that you're not only welcomed at Club A, but that your satisfaction is their reason for being.  Free appetizers or desserts have been token gestures of their appreciation on each of my two visits, but consistency at this nirvana-level of service is more than sufficient.Starting with the appetizers, the food is exceptional-- although the desserts lacked the same stellar quality as the prior courses.  You'll find the same 2 oz. shrimp in their cocktail that made the Palm's shrimp cocktail legendary.  A word of warning, however, Club A violates the standard NYC pricing for prime dry aged steaks by a few dollars.  My advice is to indulge a large appetite on the 24 oz. bone-in strip ($53)-- it is amazing.  Their steaks are nicely seasoned, correctly seared and accurately finished to-order.Club A brings its creative interpretation to the standard steakhouse side dishes in a manner which can be appreciated for their uniqueness, but at the same time, be an unwelcome distraction.  On balance, they are better than most.  I found their take on creamed spinach to be enjoyable, but lacking the assertiveness to contribute to a steakhouse experience (maybe it's a guy thing).  The mac and cheese is similarly light, but in this case, accented with truffle oil.  I didn't enjoy it.Where Club A shows a lack of polish is in infrequent and seemingly random exercises of whim.  In a dining room which is, by NYC steakhouse standards, manageably noisy, blaring (but well-chosen) 80's rock will suddenly be broadcast.  Why is this necessary?  For no apparent reason a fantasy-level dining experience is brought crashing to the ground.  Sure, the hip irony of such self-destructiveness is conveyed, but this is a horrible, self-indulgent way to stand out.Overall, an excellent steakhouse clearly worthy of second-tier status among NYC's best.  Further, while still a work-in-process, an interesting and enjoyable steakhouse experience.",12,11,12,Steve G.,"Union, NJ",681,831,0

The food was delicious: the crab cakes had big flakes of sweet crab with very little filler, the onion soup was not too salty (as it tends to be in many places), the truffle mac & cheese was simply to die for, and the steaks were expertly cooked, with an absolutely perfect char on the outside. The owner was warm and hospitable, stopping by our table to introduce himself. He later sent our table a surprise...lobster ravioli...that was delightful.I made the reservations online, and in the ""special requests"" section, simply asked for a ""quiet spot"" for my husband's birthday. Without ever mentioning it again, they went ahead and surprised us with a lovely dessert presentation, which was as yummy as it was beautiful.The meal was not cheap, but (as I only do this once a year) I splurged, and it was worth the price to have such a wonderful meal and to be treated so well.",0,0,0,Dee S.,"Forest Hills, NY",0,7,0
4.0,2/16/2012,"I came during restaurant week and we ordered: Beef Tartare, Filet mignon, cream of spinach, tiramisu, bacon, and mac and cheese (in no particular order).  The beef tartare was very very strange and not what I expected.  It looks like raw ground beef and it was mixed with an odd seasoning/sauce.  The filet mignon was great.  No complaints.  Very tender!  The cream of spinach was extremely watery and lacked flavor. The rest was ""okay"" as well.  All in all, I really enjoyed the steak itself and I think they do very well with the steaks but not so much with the rest of the stuff.  If I come here again, I'd come back for steak ONLY.  I guess if the name of your restaurant is Club A Steakhouse, you better have some damn good steaks.  :)I still give this place a 4 star because the steaks are worth going for.  Just watch out for the sides and appetizers.",0,0,0,Anita C.,"Austin, TX",53,404,53
4.0,2/16/2012,"Came here during restaurant week for my birthday.It started off with us arriving 30 minutes late for our reservation because there was horrendous traffic throughout Manhattan and it was rush hour. There was even an accident nearby, so it was a complete standstill for a bit.We parked in a parking garage and hurried over, where we were greeted warmly despite our lateness. We were seated and given our menus.I ordered a glass of red wine and the boys ordered beer.We started off with the fried calamari, steak tartare (2X) and the canadian bacon. The bacon came with a gravy-like dipping sauce. It was good, but the bacon was a tad bit too salty, especially for such a huge slab. The fried calamari was pretty good, but not that spectacular, even though it did come in a very generous portion. The steak tartare was my favorite. It was well seasoned (is ""seasoned"" the right word? haha) and it was a very good size. It also came with a fresh side salad.The entrees took a little while to come out, but they brought us complimentary lobster ravioli, which I thought was REALLY good. Good sauce, good filling, taste-able lobster chunks. They apologized a few times for the wait, but we were having a good time and it was fine. The lobster ravioli helped as well (:For our entrees, we ordered the filet mignon (2X), hanger steak and trout. The hanger steak was just okay for me. It was cooked more than I would have liked, hence it tasted a bit dry-ish (maybe it's supposed to be like that). It tasted good with the side sauce though. The filet mignon was pretty good, but I was TOO full to eat more than a few bites. The trout was very light and well-cooked. The almonds added a nice touch to it. The mac and cheese and mashed potatoes were pretty good. But I really loved the creamed spinach. It had a nice texture and perfect amount of creaminess.For dessert, we ordered 2 orders each of the cream puffs and tiramisu, but we were WAY too full to eat more than a bite. They also gave us free mini cannolis, which were really good. The cream puffs and tiramisu were also good, but we decided to pack dessert to go, since we were so full.Overall, this place has REALLY good service. The food was pretty good as well.",1,0,0,Gina K.,"New York, NY",192,533,1052

5.0,2/16/2012,"ADDENDUM!!Gabriel and I returned to Club A to celebrate Valentine's Day and WOW, what a special evening it was. There was SO much food we practically rolled out of there at the end of the night, but the overindulgence was worth every single calorie and  I can't possibly say enough good things about the way we were treated and the food we consumed.We were treated like absolute royalty by the staff and Bruno, the owner. First, a bottle of champagne and a basket of bread was brought over. Next a complimentary bottle of wonderful red wine was elaborately decanted for us.Two of the largest shrimp cocktail were our next surprise, YUM!We shared a caeser salad and a garden salad and I must rave for a moment about the outstanding caeser dressing. It was thick and creamy, with a lovely anchovy flavor and a hint of parmesan. One of the best caesers I've ever had.We were then surprised yet again with a treat of lobster ravoili. The chunks of lobster inside were so decadent and fresh, this might have been my favorite part of the meal. At this point, we already felt SO full, but there was still a ton of food coming so we prepared ourselves. I began thinking that my skintight pencil dress might not have been the best choice for my outfit.Out came our hanger steak and NY strip, cooked to perfection with the perfect amount of pink in the center. The outside was crisp and had so much flavor and juice inside...we were in meaty heaven. We also shared 2 wonderful sides of truffle oil creamed spinach and amazing mashed potatoes. We took some of the steak home and began thinking that perhaps we'd opt to take our desserts home too... Just then, out they arrived before we even ordered them! A PLATTER of sweets for us to squeeze into our bellies. It's funny how there always seems to be just a little more room when you absolutely need it. We shared a gorgeous array of chocolate heart-sharped cake, cream puffs AND tiramisu and were blown away by the beautiful presentation of fruit that arrived  shortly after. WOW.This was seriously the most food I've put away in one sitting. I was still full the next morning! Thank you SO much to Arben, Bruno and the whole staff at Club A.

4.0,2/15/2012,"I decided to round up 3 friends for the last stretch of Restaurant Week and have dinner at Club A. What a wonderful establishment on looks alone! Our server was eager to assist, even as we devoured our bread basket at an alarming speed while waiting for one of our dinner guests who was late. We ordered a bottle of Sauvignon Blanc becase, well, we fancy. The pre-fixe menu had an amazing lineup of goodies to try. My friend and I decided to order two different things so we could maximize our tasting. To start, I had the caesar salad with shaved parmesan and shared the fried calamari. The salad was decent but not my favorite and the calamari was good... but it could have been better. Lobster Ravioli for the table came out, compliments of the chef and that, i have to say was AMAZING! The pasta was perfectly cooked and the lobster filling was delicate and sweet to not overpower the light cream sauce it was covered with. I could have devoured an entire order! My friend and I split the 10 oz filet mignon that was cooked to a perfect, juicy, Medium. And we also split the pan seared salmon. I wished it was the center cut of the salmon as that is the meatier part, but all the same, the salmon was still tasty. We were offered, since we had 4 people in our group, to get each of the sides plus an order of garlic fries at no extra cost. The truffle cream spinach was better than i expected and it just just the right amount of truffle oil. The mashed potatoes were creamy and addicting! The mac and cheese was good... but not great. And the garlic fries were crisp and not too heavy on the garlic. For dessert, we received, compliments of the chef: Cannoli's! The tiramisu was okay. The lady fingers were a little on the chewy side but the cream puffs? Oh my cream puffs! HEAVENLY!I was thoroughly impressed with the filet mignon and know where my steak is coming from!

5.0,2/13/2012,"On a weekend birthday trip, My girlfriend found this restaurant on the restaurant week listing. We decided to come here because of the yelp reviews and also the prefixed menu sounded delicious! We arrived a little late for our reservations but didn't wait too long for a table. Initially walking in you can feel the comfort and love! The atmosphere was wonderful and you can tell you were in for a great experience! We got our table and were offered drinks and wine, the dinner was all over a candle light, it was amazing! We all ordered and then waited for our food to arrive. Our appetizers came out and it was amazing! I had the beef tartare and it was perfect! It was the perfect size and perfectly seasoned! My boyfriend had the calamari and that was delicious as well. Since it was my birthday my friends and boyfriend told the restaurant and they said that they would take care of it. by taking care of it they meant they were going to treat me like family and make this night amazing! Between our appetizer and our entree our waiter brought us each a lobster ravioli on the house! The lobster ravioli was amazing! I mean the texture, the size and the sauce was just perfection! I couldn't be more amazed by the quality of the food and the service! The owner came by our table after wards and made small talk and cracked joked with us, he was amazing! Our entrees came out and we were all so surprised by the size of our plates! usually high end restaurant don't usually give you large portions or filling portions but Club A Steakhouse surprised us all! My Fillet Mignon was cooked to perfection and the Homemade Mac and Cheese was Delicious! I also had some of my boyfriends Homemade Yukon Potato Puree and it was amazing! My girlfriend ordered the Veal and it came out so delicious and a hefty portion as well. My other friend had the salmon and I usually do not like fish, but I could eat that salmon all day! We probably all ate about 60% of our food before we realized how full and satisfied we were with our dinner and experience. We got the rest of our entrees to go. Realizing we still had dessert we waited patiently for the last of our three courses meal. Little did I know they bought us out all the desserts on a giant plate stating happy birthday to me! It was topped with a candle and song :) it was amazing! They gave us extra desserts and brought over Champagne, all on the house! The owner came over and wished me happy birthday and we proceeded to dig in to our desserts. We had the homemade cream puffs w/ coffee mousse i believe and it was to die for! The homemade tiramisu was amazing; it was a perfect balance and texture. Champagne to top it all off and great great great service. The waiters didn't come by too often to interrupt your meal or conversation but just enough to make sure you had what you needed and that everything was okay. I have never experienced such great atmosphere, service and quality of food anywhere in new york! THEY MADE MY BIRTHDAY SO SO SPECIAL AND MADE ME FEEL LIKE I WAS FAMILY TO THEM!

The steak was good but I liked BLT prime's better although my husband said he thought the filet mignon here may have been better than BLT prime. He really enjoyed his cauliflower soup and gobbled it up. I got the fried calamari which was fine. The truffled spinach was too truffle-y for me. As was the truffled mac & cheese. I know truffle is expensive and a lot of people love it so if you do, then you would love the menu here but it is too overwhelming for me. I liked the mashed potatoes. The tiramasu was good as well-very creamy. They threw in a plate of mini cannolis which was very nice of them. The ambience here is great-nice decor and lighting. Candle light, a rose in the center.

We were serenaded by the sweet soulful crooning of a two man ensemble close by. Fireplace was roaring. If any of the couples here were on a date last night the ambiance certainly helped make it a panty dropper evening!We were handed the menu for the Yelp deal, and it even had a ""I Love Yelp"" logo on it. Bruno suggested we try the porterhouse for two instead of the filet mignon or any of the other entrees. We decided to go for it and when the plate came to the table we both thought - ""Good God - that thing is huge!"" Half of it was NY strip steak and the other half was filet mignon. Medium rare and pink in the middle. Wow - just wow. Not only did we get a good bottle of red wine with our meal, but we also received complimentary jumbo shrimp cocktail, lobster ravioli, cannolis, and a fresh cut fruit sculpture. We also had the cream puffs as part of the deal for dessert and the malty cream they were covered in was terrific. Again, the truffle creamed spinach and yukon gold mashed potatoes as sides were scrumptious sides too. This meal went on and on and on. Everything was delicious.After we were finished Bruno needed our table and asked us to take a seat at the bar where he treated us to an evening ending cocktail. Just a perfect ending to an outstanding romantic meal. We arrived at 7 and did not leave until close to 11.

We had a reservation for 7PM on a Saturday night and arrived a little late, but were greeted warmly and Bruno seated us right away. The bar was bustling and there was live jazz music playing. The ambiance was nice and reminded me what I've been missing since the last time we were here. The staff greeted us promptly and gave us our menus. It was so cool that they had a special one for yelp which said on top: We heart yelp! (it was an actual red heart!)We ordered the Steak tartare and Thick sliced Canadian bacon as appetizers again. For the entrees, I ordered the King Salmon and he got the chicken. For the sides we got the truffle infused cream of spinach and decided to try the mac and cheese. Desserts we ordered one of each - cream puffs and tiramisu. We also had a bottle of red wine - Cabernet Sauvignon.We first received some bread with butter and we both enjoyed the bread that tasted like it had olives in it. Yum! Now if you read my last review..my boyfriend doesn't eat red meat or seafood so of all the things we ordered, you'll get a small idea of what i was going to eat...The bacon came and halfway through, i felt a little disappointed in myself for feeling a bit full.. on to the steak tartare. Finished the tartare and side salad. I felt so bad because a waiter walked by and asked if there was anything wrong with it! NO! IT WAS SO DELICIOUS! but i was able to pack it to go! =)THEN we were brought COMPLIMENTARY JUMBO SHRIMP on ice with the appropriate side dips and lemon. Again i had to eat it...THEN AGAIN we were brought COMPLIMENTARY LOBSTER RAVIOLI - these were so good! AND AGAIN.. I had to eat both of ours...By the time the entrees came, i was about ready to pop while the bf sat there and had a good laugh every time something complimentary was given to us. The king salmon was KING indeed and sitting on top of spinach sauteed with garlic. Very delicious! This time, my bf thoroughly enjoyed the chicken and very much so enjoyed his meal! He also thought the mac and cheese was very good! I sadly did not get a chance to touch the truffle spinach...but my fat self did finish my entire dish...a bit laboriously.. haha :)Time for dessert!Cream puffs were soft, but didn't really have much taste. I wouldn't say it was bad - i ate the whole things..tiramisu was good as well and as if i needed this.. we were brought our ANOTHER COMPLIMENTARY dessert - carrot cake. The cake was ok - had nuts in it, but like i said..i was too full to enjoy much!We had a wonderful time at Club A and were so happy we went! The staff was so nice and attentive and as hoped for - every time I got up to go to the restroom or something, my napkin was folded for me! Even upstairs near the restroom and bar, they greet you with a warm hello! The waitstaff and helpers were all so accommodating and polite! Bruno was amazing and such a nice man! He came by every so often to speak with us (and others and well as with patrons upstairs) and made us feel important and well taken care of. He saw the table next to ours and noticed they were low their on puree potato side so he whispered something to one of the waiters and within minutes, i saw the waiter bringing them a new dish of potatoes. What a kind and generous man! Little things like this make Club A Steakhouse the classy and upscale place it is!I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND CLUB A STEAKHOUSE because it is such a treat to be a patron here! Everyone is treated with the utmost respect and even though we had a voucher, we were treated just as highly as someone without one. Portions are HUGE, ambiance is great for a romantic dinner or a nice night out with friends. Music was nice, but not overbearing and you are always being looked after whether or not you know it! Go and enjoy yourself! Thanks again Yelp and Club A! :)One more thing I'd like to add. We didn't specify that it was our anniversary so the treatment we received was genuine and authentic and I can't imagine what else they could do to improve a special occasion, but we'll definitely be back to see! :)",2,0,1,Melissa N.,"Brooklyn, NY",339,576,1025

The girlfriend got the seabass was on a bed of carrots and asparagus with a balsamic; tasty but a bit overcooked. We got three sides, creamed spinach, brussel sprouts, and asparagus. The creamed spinach had just the right amount of cream and garlic. Same with the asparagus. The brussell sprouts were OK. They also tossed in a complimentary truffle Mac n' Cheese which just blew us away in taste. For dessert, we got a sampler plate of tiramisu, puffs, and canoli. The tiramisu was awesome, not too sweet and paired perfectly with the coffee. The canoli was really good too, the shell was nice and light and the filling was smooth and not too cheesy.

It's got an intimate bar up front, staffed by a friendly and efficicient bartender, Christina, who offered me a sample of a single barrel bourbon I'd never heard of before (hard to believe such a thing exists).  The owner (Bruno) was there to greet us when we checked in and periodically stopped by our table to make sure we were happy. He bought us an after dinner drink as a thank you for our patronage. Very classy gentleman and attentive proprietor. Been there 40+ years so he must be doing something right. The service was great, bordering on over attentive. But the waitstaff were comfortable expressing their personality, which added a level of charm and fun. Most of these men were from Kosovo, and expressed a pride in their jobs and homeland that was impressive Ordered grilled seabass on sautéed asparagus and carrots. Fish was crisp on outside and tender on the inside. Maybe just a tad overdone, but maybe not. I tend to like my fish rare. The veggies were crisp, fresh and delicious Ina balsamic reduction. The NY Steak was big, juicy, aged and delicious. Side of mashed potatoes was rather small and overpriced ($10?).  Everything else was fair priced for NY. Knocked off a (half) star as they were out of the first three wines I ordered. I guess I could've added it back as the replacement they found was more than serviceable. They decanted it at the table and served it in great stemware. No dessert, too full.  Don't hesitate to try it.  You won't be disappointed.

4.0,2/10/2012,"I've been here 3 times over the course of the last year (2 restaurant weeks, 1 regular meal), and it's on my list of steakhouses to visit if I'm looking for a chunky piece of BEEF. The service has been consistently attentive, and the manager has made a point 2/3 times I was there to check in with us, which is a great personal touch. Now for the food:For one general comment: portion sizes are LARGE. I felt like each part of the meal could've been the size of a meal I'd eat...so every time I come here, it's like eating 3 meals over a course of 1.5-2hrs. Not that I'm complaining of the huge portions (better that than leaving hungry), but just to keep in mind!Appetizers:- Steak tartare -- it's raw beef as it should be, sauced as it should be to cut the taste of the raw beef. But honestly, I just don't think I'm a huge fan of this dish in general. I found it tasteful enough, but not out of this world.- Sizzling thick strip of bacon: smoky, charred nicely, absolutely DELICIOUS hunk of fat. It's about 1-1.5cm thick, about 10cm in length, comes with a sauce that I personally didn't care for much (I like my foods in the original taste). It was so flavorful without anything on it, and it wasn't dry at all, which was awesome. The only caveat is that fat = makes your body think it's full faster; therefore, as appetizer, it's literally the most filling thing you can get!- Fried Calamari -- they do great fried calamari here -- I love that the calamari is FRESH, chewy to the right amount. Because the way to screw this dish up is to use crappy calamari that is like rubber chewy fried in batter. And they certainly don't do that here!Main dishes: (pic of veal shank!)- Filet mignon 10oz cut: I've had this twice, both times medium rare and cooked to medium rare correctly. Reading other reviews, seems like this isn't a consistency they keep up with, but for me, it's always been faithful. And let me just say that it makes me happy to be alive, being able to eat that delicious cut of meat. And happy to be not vegetarian...anyways. Compared to filet mignons I've had in life, it's definitely up there although not at the top. I'd be delighted to get a chance to eat it any time.NOTE: Pair it with a wine! Their decanters are fascinating =D And red wine really should be aerated properly (on that note, their wine list is pretty extensive, with price ranges equivalent to the meal to...probably one's month or several months' rent). - Veal shank osso bucco. Let me just say that veal = delicious meat. Osso bucco = acquired taste. You should try it once in your life if you have yet to -- but as for the veal itself, it was TENDER. and perfectly cooked. Literally falling off that bone such that you didn't even need a knife. The sauce it was drenched in (again, I like my foods without huge amts of sauce due to my usual low-sodium preference) was delicious, but there was definitely a LOT of sauce. The rice that it was served over was just...rice. Not undercooked or overcooked, but flavor-wise, not much extra flavors I gathered from it. If I were not so ridiculously full from everything that preceded the main course, I'd have finished this dish clean (I brought it home instead)!Sides: (see pictures for the spread!)- Creamed spinach -- used to be more powerful in taste when I first came here -- it was relatively watery last night when I went for restaurant week. The truffle oil taste has been diminishing. And trust me, it's not a healthy side haha it will be heavy enough along with the rest of the heavy meal. - Potato puree -- who doesn't love a smooth side of pure potato awesomeness with their filet mignons? I got to have this side when getting steak. I also sensed a hint of truffle last night, although I don't recall that from the other 2 times I've been here.- Mac and Cheese --  this is definitely my second favorite side. There is also truffle oil in this, I'm pretty sure. Not super cheesy or creamy, which helps bc rest of the meal is heavy!Desserts: (tiramisu, cannoli pictures!)- Homemade tiramisu -- nothing remarkable but light and not heavy on the rum. The taste is there, but relatively one-dimensional. I like the lightness of the cream on top, but by this point, I'm literally bursting. =) From awesome food, that is. Goes awesome with a cup of coffee.- Homemade cream puffs -- I honestly would prefer this without the garnish it comes with -- a creamy...sauce and chocolate syrup drizzled over it -- honestly, the cream puff itself is relatively good, and the sauce just makes it soggy rather than letting the puff pastry stand on its own.- COMPLIMENTARY mini cannolis -- definitely the highlight of the dessert for me. I devoured this! It's not the best cannoli I've had, but Club A does a great job with this cannoli. I'd love to get this as my dessert of choice.highly recommend for RW! Awesome deal for sure.",2,0,1,Jihye K.,"New York, NY",13,21,12

We shared pictures of his family and my g/f of her new niece. He sat us upstairs at the table for two in front of the window. At night, it's stunning to see the tree behind full of lights.

They have separate rooms for other large parties.I went here for restaurant week due to its extensive options. For appetizer I got the caesar salad. It was your typical ceasar salad. The Mrs got the calimari, which was your typical calimari. We got some free lobster ravioli in between. It was good. The bartender mixed the drinks very well. We had two waiters in our room which moved both swiftly and efficiently.For dinner, The Mrs ordered veal. It was so big, I think we got the whole cow. I go the beef with side of creamed spinach. It was quite tasty. The Mrs got the side of mac n cheese, which I was not a big fan of.For dessert, another hug dish, I got the puffs, and the Mrs. got the tarimisu.

5.0,2/7/2012,"So this is going to be my first review of any restaurant and usually I'm too lazy to type up a review but this place has forced my hand. We came here for 'restaurant week' with a friend who has been here before while it was my first time. I arrived first and chilled at the bar. Very friendly bartender who was willing to chat and make me a random drink of her choosing. After my friend my arrived, we were promptly seated and welcomed by the owner (i'm guessing) and we talked about his photograph with him and his 'granddaughter?' (memory's fading). We chose the 35 dollar 3 course meal each and added an extra appetizer for us to share. Appetizers came out promptly, He had the canadian bacon and i had a caesar salad and we shared the seafood platter which consisted of half a lobster, 2 jumbo shrimp, and some crab meat with some mustard mayo and cocktail sauce for dipping.  After we finished with those, we munched on the free bread. After a few minutes, the waiter noticed our filet mignon was taking too long and got us some lobster ravioli to occupy us. After that, we got our filet mignons and our sides of creamed spinach and mac and cheese. By now were feeling overly stuffed but then came dessert. I got the tiramisu and my friend got the cream puffs and they also gave us complimentary cannolis. I'd rate the food a 4 but the service a double 5. Service totally makes this place worth it alone. The owner (again, guessing) came back to check on us couple of times. All the staff is friendly and random complimentary food! Who hates free stuff? Quick rundown of the food:Bread - good variety.Caesar Salad - average.Canadian bacon - the seared parts tastes too burnt but has the fatty parts on still which is a plus for me. :)Seafood Platter (royal?): average. Lobster Ravioli - Great.Filet Mignon - Medium rare, good. Rare, great!.Creamed Spinach infused with Truffle oil - Good.Mac & Cheese - Didn't think this would ever be in my vocabulary but, too much butter... All I tasted was butter, got sick of it real quick.Cannoli - Awesome!Tiramisu - Good.Cream puffs - Very bland. Did not like.",1,1,1,Minh D.,"Garden Grove, CA",142,6,0
4.0,2/7/2012,"RW dinner review!!It's a GREAT deal for dinner!Started out with the caesar salad, and friend got the bacon. The bacon... ohmygoodness. Had to be 1cm thick, and was tasty, chewy, crispy, and delicious all in one bite. I'd suggest serving it over a bed of veggies or something, because by the end it was overwhelming my taste buds. They surprised us with a lobster ravioli on the house, covered in a cream sauce and topped with asparagus. Yummy, but nothing special. Definitely save room for the steak.DEFINITELY get the spinach with truffle oil, and the mac n cheese! They don't tell you, but I think that the M&C has a hint of truffle oil in it as well!And delicious steak! Got the filet mignon (although I was DEFINITELY eyeing the osso buco at the table next to us--may try that if I ever go back) and it was wonderfully cooked with a nice sear on the outside with lots of flavor.Dessert was a little bit of a disappointment, but they did throw in extra cannoli on the house too! The cream puffs were drenched in some sort of sauce that I didn't think was necessary. When I did get a bite where it was more cream puff than sauce, I thought the texture was great. Tiramisu was pretty standard, and pretty rich. Service was great and attentive, but the deco/atmosphere was a little bit strained. They tried to add a romance factor with a long-stemmed roses in vases + long tapered candles, and there were several occasions at our table and the ones around us where the candles caused a lot of smoke, or toppled over and spilled glasses of water! Definitely make an effort to get around here during RW. They run it during lunch, too!",1,1,1,Hetty W.,"Seattle, WA",50,245,17

5.0,2/4/2012,"I feel SO blessed to have been able to come here for dinner/restaurant week! I literally felt like I was treated like the most important person on the face of this earth. My friend and I walked into the restaurant, cautious that we weren't dressed properly, and that they would judge our appearance since we had just traveled to the city from our school. Boy, was I wrong. They smiled at us, and welcomed us in. When our table was ready, the waiter brought us upstairs to our seats; I half-expected him to sit us down at a tiny table next to the restrooms, but he led us to the paneled-glass windows in the front of the restaurant. I must say, the view was beautiful, especially the tree decorated with Christmas lights. Then, right when we finished ordering, Bruno (the owner of Club A) walked over to us and humbly welcomed us - he was so heartwarming! Prior to coming to this restaurant, my friend had yelped it and noticed how many people received complimentary dishes. So, we didn't expect much, but when our appetizers came, we received a complimentary shrimp cocktail. We ordered the steak tartare and the sizzling canadian bacon. The steak tartare (to me) tasted very similar to raw salmon - I thought it was delicious, and the salad that came with it was tarty and refreshing! The sizzling canadian bacon was made just right - juicy and tender; however, it was a little too salty for me. Otherwise, great appetizer choices. Then, out of the blue, we got a complimentary dish of lobster ravioli (one pc per person). This, was downright delicious. You can definitely taste the lobster, which is balanced by the ravioli and the cream sauce. If I come to this restaurant again (not for restaurant week), I would definitely get the lobster ravioli dish. After appetizers, we got our entrees and side dishes together. For entrees, we ordered the hanger steak and the filet mignon (both medium rare); the side dishes were the creamy truffle oil spinach, and the potato puree. ALL of this was delicious. The hanger steak was very beefy tasting; however, it's impossible to focus on that sole taste because the meat itself was tender, juicy, and flavorful. The filet mignon was crunchy on the outside, but the inside was so soft and succulent. As we were getting started on our main course, the waiter comes by with ANOTHER complimentary dish - this time it was a huge bowl of lobster mac and cheese!! This was absolutely magnificent - creamy, cheesy, and hints of lobster. I usually get sick of mac and cheese, but I couldn't stop taking bites of this mac and cheese. The creamy truffle oil spinach was delicious - it was buttery, and sweet. It went well with the potato puree (fancy for mashed potato). Excellent combination of entrees and side dishes.When we moved on to our desserts, we told ourselves, they definitely won't give us the carrot cake or the cannolis....but when the waiter approached our table, with three plates in his hand, we were downright shocked... We received a complimentary carrot cake with lots of whipped cream (!!) and cream puffs and tiramisu! ... The desserts were delicious, the carrot cake especially. The exterior of the Cream Puffs was fried, but you can tell that they were definitely freshly made. The interior was not too sweet and blended well with the exterior. The tiramisu was pretty good - the lady fingers were so soft. The carrot cake was dense and decadent - and I LOVED THE CREAM CHEESE frosting!! and the huge pile of whipped cream next to it... The atmosphere itself is very romantic: great for a date, but also perfect for a relaxing night out with some girlfriends. The waiters are so polite, so patient, so humorous, and so sweet. I will definitely come here again... Club A Steakhouse let me feel so welcomed, and I think that even despite the very few flaws in their food, their wonderful service overpowered everything else!",1,0,0,Isabelle Z.,"New York, NY",38,30,37
5.0,2/4/2012,"So we walk in are almost immediately seated, 1 waiter took our drink order, a second waiter came by and gave us the menus, a 3rd waiter came by and took drink orders, we didn't feel overwhelmed, it was actually very well handled and no matter who you ask for anything, everyone is ready and willing to help.I began my order HOPING that they would have the Kobe ribeye, unfortunately they did not and the waiter recommended the regular ribeye, he told me that there is absolutely no comparison to the regular ribeye but it is still very good.I also ordered the creamed spinach, slice of bacon and the tomato & buffalo mozzarella.Bacon - AmazingTomato and mozzarella - SuperbCreamed spinach - one of the best I have hadRibeye - I asked them to make it medium rare and to make sure it will not be over cooked and that I would rather have it a little undercooked.

One of the best steaks I have had.I read reviews about how they randomly bring out complimentary dishes, and, come on really? Didn't believe it even for a second.

3.0,1/31/2012,"I was looking forward to trying Club A for Restaurant Week after seeing the other great reviews, and having gone a long time without a good steak. Their Restaurant Week menu had tons of great-sounding choices.The atmosphere/decor was nice, and the location was handy. I had the fried calamari for an appetizer, which were tasty and a good non-rubbery texture. My main course was the filet mignon, with a side of delicious mac & cheese with some cheese blend that was far from the standard American/Velveeta concoction some places put on. My dessert was the cream puffs, which, as others have said, were delicious. We also got a couple complimentary things brought out that were good, and the wine was tasty and went well with the meal.Now, by this point, you may be wondering why I'm only giving it 3 stars when so many things went well. Or you might be wondering why I didn't say anything about the steak, which actually answers the previous point. The steak was just bad. I ordered it medium rare, and the stick in it said medium rare. For some reason, it was wedge-shaped, much taller than wide, which I've never seen before, anywhere from the Outback chain to Emeril's top-notch steakhouse in Las Vegas. My friend got the filet mignon as well, and hers was shaped like a regular filet mignon. The first sign something was wrong was the crunching sound and shards of burnt steak flying off as I began to cut into it. Sure enough, it was gray throughout. I cut the thickest part and it had a little pink, but this was NOT a medium-rare steak. My friend's medium filet had a little more pink than this burnt piece of meat. So I told the waiter, and showed it to him, and he finally reluctantly offered to replace it. No understanding, no apology, like he was doing me a favor by bothering to get my order right. A minute later, he comes back with someone else (the manager?), sets the plate back in front of me, and tells me to cut all the way into the thickest part. I do, reiterate it's not medium-rare, he says it is, I shake my head in disbelief. I've never heard of any restaurant bringing your food back to you after you send it back; even McDonald's won't do that. I decide I'll work on what pieces of the steak are edible. A couple minutes later, without warning, they bring me another steak. I hoped that meant they'd realized their mistake, but it was shaped almost as badly, and done just like the first. The waiter came by later and asked about it, I told him, and he didn't say a thing. How does a steakhouse like this not have any clue how to cook steak?It's interesting to note as I read the reviews here more closely, lots of people who gave it 4 or 5 stars also indicated their steaks were not cooked properly. Diana S., like me, said the steak was her only gripe (though I'd add their reaction to my complaints about the steak). I guess they're more able to overlook a steakhouse that doesn't cook steak correctly.As good as everything but the steak was here, I wouldn't come back. That was the main course and the main reason I went, and 3 stars is generous.

When we sat down on our table we asked for a wine list/cocktail list and our waiter just said it was an open bar. Not really setting the right impression. Just telling us it's an open bar doesn't mean anything. So off to not a great start. For our appetizers we ordered the canadian bacon and the steak tartare. The canadian bacon wasn't too bad but I thought the cocktail sauce complemented well. Was it worth it? Meh. The steak tartare was probably one of the best steak tartares I have ever had. The fresh salad it came with went really well together. It had all the right flavoring. For the entree we ordered the filet mignon and the hanger steak with the spinach and the yukon potato. The filet mignon (cooked medium)  was extremely dry. I didn't like it at all. I felt it needed some sort of sauce on the side or maybe the steak itself needed something. The hanger steak (cooked medium rare) was a smidge too rare for me. The sauce was pretty good but the steak itself was not flavored. The truffle oil spinach was not that great. I've had better flavored spinach and this doesn't go near it. I thought the yukon potatoes was pretty good. They were velvety smooth and had good flavor. During the entree we had a complimentary dish - the lobster ravioli. The sauce was good but I felt the ravioli was a little bit thicker than it should be. The asparagus was good as well but whoever prepped them didn't do that great because some of the outer layer was not shaved off. It was lukewarm as well. For desserts we had the cream puffs and the tiramisu. I thought the chefs were too heavy on the chocolate mousse in the cream puff dish. The cream in the cream puff was just regular whipped cream. It would've been better if they actually flavored the cream to add it another dimension. The tiramisu was a better dessert in my opinion. The cake was a little bit thicker and the mousse tasted better. They also gave us cannolis. I've never been a fan of them because after a bite they usually fall apart. This was no different. It was average. Would I go back? It depends if I'm going with someone whose going to pay for me. For the price points they have - it wouldn't be worth it.~happy eatings!",0,0,0,Rosa C.,"New York, NY",397,236,27
5.0,1/25/2012,"This place is a must-go for restaurant week. It was a really good deal and I wonder if the restaurant is making a loss by offering such a decadent menu for restaurant week.So for $35++ ... from a more selective menu (which still has really good choices) you get a choice of a starter (priced between $5 - $18 on the actual menu), an entree (which could be as expensive as $35), a side ($8-$11) and a dessert.We ordered and enjoyed (tremendously) the following:Starter:- Canadian bacon (which is highly recommended by yelpers) - though a tad cheaper than the other starter options, I felt it was really good and is a must-try at Club A. Don't be deceived by its highly affordable price tag. It was a solid, fat and long piece of bacon which could be an entree on its own.- Steak Tartare (regularly priced at $18) - good beyond words. The side salad which came with it was fresh and nicely dressed!Entree:- Hanger steak - the sauce (which I think was club A sauce) was a perfect complement to the nicely done up medium rare steak! It was a generous serving - even as a big-eater, I could not finish my portion!Sides:- Mac n Cheese - better than the average mac n cheese- Truffle oil infused creamed spinach (highly recommended by yelpers) - 6 STARS. It was so delish. You could taste the truffle which went so well with the spinach. It was not oily at all!- Potato puree - average(just go ahead and order spinach and skip the other two sides)Desserts:- Tiramisu - it was not fantastic but delicious enough to give a nice ending to the sumptuous meal!- Cream puffs - one of the best cream puffs I had in my life!!!! (order this over tiramisu)BONUS: The waiter accidentally toppled my friend's tomato sauce on the table (nope, it did not affect my friend's appetite nor attire in any way). Despite my friend being really nice about it, the chef sent us the following compliment dishes:- Lobster Ravioli - this is a lobster ravioli with a lot of lobster substance. The cream sauce was delish to the max!- A sweet cream-filled croquette-like pastry- Chocolate+Vanilla ice-cream in chocolate crust with cherries! (mind-blowing good)Club A totally blew my mind off with its generosity and willingness to please its customers who were here to dine with a restaurant-week budget! Immaculate service - the servers kept checking on us, refilling our water and wine (check out the cute decanters they used)! The manager of the restaurant even walked us out of the restaurant and sent us off in a proper and polite manner - so as to make our entire dining experience as wholesome as it could be.This is the best service I have received in any NYC restaurant so far.

5.0,1/25/2012,"I'm sooo happy I discovered this place through yelp! THANK YOU YELP REVIEWERS! & on top of it going for restaurant week was sooo worth it!The waiter came by with bread and water very quickly. I'm not a big fan of bread but I liked the multigrain one; soft and tasty.Me and my friend both had the prefix. I started with the calamari and he started with the Canadian bacon. My calamari was spicy and I really liked it. It was a big dish for a small person like me too. The Canadian bacon was so unique. I thought it tasted like ham. We totally forgot about the dipping sauce, so can' t say anything about that. Then the server came out with lobster ravioli, on the house. At that point we were already semi full and was so surprised that they would serve us more apetizers! The one ravioli was palm size and had a big piece of lobster on top. The lobster was delicious! I had some of the ravioli and it was really good. Our main course was...steak! I had the Hunger steak. 10oz, was more than enough! I actually had to take it home. It was very tasty and juicy! And the sauce was light and flavourful! My friend had the filet minion. Crispy outside and sweet overall.Our two sides were the spinach and the mac and cheese. I'm not a great fan of mac and cheese; he felt that it was a little generic, nothing special. The spinach was a little sweet for me. Lastly, my favorite part of dinner creampuffs and tiramisu. And more compliments of the chef, canolis! I was so impresed. The tiramisu was very creamy and bready. But both were presented very well. But out of the three I like the canoli. The light and flaky bread reminded me of a danish and the canoli cream was lemony sweet! Absolutely loved it!Highly recommend & can't wait to go back!!!",0,0,0,Amanda L.,"Brooklyn, NY",12,350,0

5.0,1/25/2012,"HOLY FOOD BATMAN! Forrealzzz the most amount of food I've gotten during restaurant week (even more than Asia de Cuba!!)Where to begin? The food was good, the service amazing, and the atmosphere fun! I''ve honestly never received such warm, fun and friendly service at any restaurant ever.Drinks: Two of my roomies didn't want to really drink that night (Birthday girl included) so I wanted to split a bottle with my 3rd roommate. We didn't know what we wanted, but was recommended a $25 bottle special of Malbec as part of RW deal! Shhhaweett. My wine glass and my water glass was NEVER empty. I don't even remember them refilling it. Ninja'd for sure.Appetizers: I ordered the Canadian bacon because I just can't resist me some pork fat. My slab was a little too fatty and chewy, but my roommate's slab looked better so I think it was just bad luck. As much as I do enjoy it, I'd have to say Peter Luger's was better. We also received lobster raviolis on the house. I totally foodgasm-ed. Can I just get a vat of that to go? Yum. They didn't skimp on the lobster either. I usually don't like creamy sauces but ended up swirling my ravioli around to soak it up. The birthday girl who doesn't like lobster at all, finished hers before all of us.Entrees: I ordered the hanger steak medium but probably should have gone with medium rare because it was a bit tough to chew. My steak was probably the only gripe I had about Club A. I think if I were to come again I'd get the filet and definitely opt for medium rare. The osso bucco was tender, delicious and seasoned to perfection. I don't like salmon but took a small bite and it was bearable, so I'd consider that a win (getting me to even try salmon!). Sides: OH EM GEE so good. Since there were four of us, they brought out one of each side for us plus garlic fries that aren't on the RW menu so we can try something different. Each side was amaziinngggg. My favorite thing to do is to combine two of the sides (i.e. mac and cheese and creamed spinach) into a single bite! The potatoes were light and velvety, mac and cheese had a punch of sharp cheese flavor and the spinach with truffle oil was crack. Dessert: While the birthday girl was in the bathroom, our waiter asked us for her name and what she was turning so he can write it on a big plate for her with all of our desserts (+ free cannolis!). We were also offered free champagne and SHOTS - haha how awesome is that. We opted for champagne in an attempt to be ladylike after our protein feast. The tiramisu was good but I still dream of the one from Financier. However, I adore the cream puffs! There is this coffee whipped topping that makes them TDF.I absolutely love this restaurant. The food would probably earn 4 stars, but the entire package definitely 5! We felt so special that the owner took his time (with his drink in hand) and went around to all the tables to ask how our meal was and if we were enjoying it (he also was took a picture for us!).

5.0,1/24/2012,"All the three time I've been here, I've been blown away! THIS IS MY FAVORITE NYC STEAK HOUSE! After our second time, my husband and I decided to celebrate our birthdays here. We immediately reserved the private room on the third floor for a party of 15. We were assured that they would take good care of us, and they could not be anymore right. A few days upon reserving, I received an e-mail from one of their event coordinators asking how they could better accommodate us. I was very impressed with their level of professionalism and response time. They did not pressure me to go one way or the other.On the day of our party, my husband and I arrived a bit early. To our surprise, the room was already ready and we were able to enjoy some alone time together next to the fireplace in their beautiful room. Since we had called ahead of time, we were then offered the restaurant week red and white wine, which was a super awesome deal. If you aren't interested in that, they also offer a reasonable corkage fee per bottle. On top of that, they have these really cool looking decanters!To our pleasant surprise, Bruno (restaurant owner) put in a special order for fresh salmon/mozzarella bites that were passed around by their friendly waiters. And the bread was just as good as I had remembered. My guests trickled in, and yet, there was no pressure from the waitstaff to order food. In fact, I was amazed at how much time flew by before we even placed our order. The guys were even watching the Syracuse football game on the flat screen, while some were just chilling on the private balcony outside.When it came time, I, myself ordered the Canadian bacon, potato puree, filet mignon cooked medium rare, and tiramisu. And I don't even know how the mac and cheese and spinach got there! YUM! Club A never ceases to satisfy my big tummy. I will post up pictures soon even though they won't do it justice. The only downside was that everything was so good, that I ate way too much for my own good. I can't believe I even took home the leftovers.. and I was not the only one.Surprise after surprise- we were also each given a slice of birthday cake.. along with our dessert plus cannoli! Even my friends who did not order a dessert got one. I love it! They made us feel SO special! And when we thoughts things could not get any better, Bruno came in to announce that he would give us each a drink of our choice- on the house! We ordered cocktails to ports to martinis. It. was. great. Honestly, I started to hope he was not taking a big hit because of us. I have never been treated so well by a New York City restaurant. It was surely a HAPPY birthday to us.Don't think twice about this place. You won't get better service/quality anywhere else and definitely will not go home disappointed. Seriously, I don't rave about too many restaurants, but when I do.. I go all out! Thank you Club A! We will most definitely be back! :)",4,1,0,Christina Y.,"Arlington, VA",144,308,68

Don't judge us most of it was wrapped up, honest.The only thing that sucked was the mac n cheese which ive had better at chain restaurants, where is the crunch? Anyways onto the good. The potato puree was so light and airy +1. Jumbo shrimp were the size of my fiance's fist, no joke +1. Canadian bacon was like the size of a steak and MUCH better than peter luger's +1.  Pea soup and house salad were also well liked.  Finally the filets, medium rare cooked perfectly inside with a delicious crust on the outside +1.Lastly, the service was superb, water was always filled and were very well taken care of +1.It breaks my heart that my phone with all the pics broke over the weekend but life goes on...Check it out!!",1,0,1,Dave C.,"New Hyde Park, NY",44,193,48

So this time, I came without any expectations, and the night turned out to be amazing , the reviews on yelp were true, and the service at the place was spot on! We had a reservation on a Monday night, i havent seen my girl friend in like months, there were a lot of catching up to do! And having dinner here was perfect! The place was so cozy, and romantic, definitely a great spot to take someone on a date. Since we both just got off work, and had tons of stuff with us, our host actually took us upstairs to the second floor and gave us a table with the sofa seatings! We had the yelp deal, so the menu was different from the regular menu, and our waiter did not..I REPEAT, DID NOT treated us any less than someone who was paying full price! LOVE IT! We went with Red Wine, since we were going to have red meat. I had Cesar Salad, Filet Mignon - Medium Well, Potato Pureee, and Tiramisu for dessert!Food came at their expected rate of time, there wasnt much awkward moments and our waiter always came by to make sure everything was good and that we were taken care of! Cesar Salad was yummy, and to our surprise they gave us Shrimp Cocktail on the house, super yummy as well! And then we got the Lobster Ravioli on the house as well....OMG, it was delicious and sooo creamy!!! Then came my Filet Mignon which WAS Medium Well. For the first time, my meat was actually Medium Well, not Well Done! Thank You! The meat was tender, and so easy to cut through....love it!  Potato Pure was yummy, but a bit on the salty side, and last but not least our dessert came! And again, we got spoiled!

4.0,1/21/2012,"Loved it!   The ambiance, the decor, the live music, the timing, and the food. I started with an order of ceasar salad but after mentioning to the waiter that I have a shellfish allergy he promptly alerted me that the ceasar salad comes with anchovies and suggested that I try their mixed green salad instead.  The mixed green salad contained fresh spinach, radicchio, red onions, radish, feta cheese, and was very delicious.  Loved it!Next,  I ordered their filet mignon and my date ordered the King salmon along with side orders of 5 cheese truffle mac & cheese and their cream spinach. The spinach was kind of bland, the mac & cheese was pretty good, the filet mignon was tasty...a little on the chewy side (maybe because I ordered it well done), but it was still tender enough to slice without much force and tasty nonetheless. My date enjoyed his salmon and was given a complimentary sample of their lobster ravioli (so much for a good night kiss).  I was given a complimentary sample of their Mozzarella and tomato since I have the shellfish allergy.  That was nice of them. Liked it!For dessert I had the cream puffs, my date had the tiramisu, and they gave us complimentary cannolis. The desserts were very delicious and all meals were very well presented.  They also have a great Reisling.  Loved it!The check in and coat check staff were all very pleasant and our waiter was excellent.  The owner of the restaurant personally greeted and shook hands with the patrons who sat at every table...except ours. I don't want to believe that it might have something to do with the fact that my date and I were the only African American Patrons in the restaurant at that time. Instead, I'd like to believe that maybe he thought he greeted us already since we did arrive and were seated before the patrons who sat next to us.  I guess I'll know for sure if/when I decide to dine here again in the future.

5.0,1/16/2012,"Basically joined Yelp to write this review as my experience here on two occasions have been spectacular.I've been to some of the major steakhouses in NYC but I must say, Club A Steakhouse has to sit near the top of my list. For appetizers, I have tried the Jumbo Shrimp, Onion Soup, Escargot, Canadian Bacon and the Oysters and they have all been fresh and delicious.  Both times I've gotten the escargot, truly an amazing appetizer there.Tried both the Ribeye and Porterhouse and both were cooked to what I expected and were truly enjoyable.  The staff also provided a choice of 5 or 6 different sauces, which they didn't mind us trying almost all of them.  Some were better than others but didn't really need too much sauce along with the steak, more eaten out of curiosity.With the sides, I really enjoyed the hashbrowns, wild mushrooms, and truffle oil mac and cheese.  The others were good but these three are the ones that stuck out to me.The food you will find to be comparable to the other major steakhouses in NYC but what really stands out about Club A Steakhouse is the service. Bruno, the owner of this establishment, has really defined what a great restaurant owner should be doing. We made conversation with him the first time we were there, not knowing he was the owner, but over the night he really took care of us and made sure we enjoyed our meal. The amount of attention he showed was nowhere near overbearing but actually made us feel very welcome and definitely made the night more enjoyable.  The first night, we even got the chance to get two rounds of Bruno's favorite liquor with him.On my second visit, he remembered us and made sure to walk us to our table and make sure we were doing well, as well as offering us some dishes on the house for us to try, which were all very enjoyable and appreciated.This is definitely a steakhouse I will frequently choose to visit as Bruno has really made sure our experience there has been excellent, and it truly has been.Definitely check out Club A Steakhouse and get to know Bruno, as he is an exemplary restaurant owner that really knows how to make his customers happy!",0,0,0,Tim M.,"Manhattan, NY",547,31,9

4.0,1/12/2012,"Okay.  Because of Yelp I went here (although I had walked by many times) so now I must comment on it and must say it far exceeded my expectations which were reasonably high based on the reviews here.  The atmosphere is reasonably nice, although a bit loud.  We identified ourselves as Yelp customers (on the last day of our coupon).  We were escorted to a lovely corner table and felt like we were at a tasting dinner at a great restaurant.  We were not treated as ""coupon customers"" but frankly felt more like VIPs.  The breads were very good and various breads were offered.We were served our wine and frankly I did not expect to enjoy it as I am very particular.  I believe the brand was Fox Hollow.  It is a very inexpensive cab, but actually very good.  Really.  Did not need decanting, but why not.  Can't hurt and it did look nice in their strange decanter.There were many choices and we went with the highly recommended Canadian Bacon, which is superb.  I had never seen bacon like that or frankly tasted bacon like that.  In fact, I rarely eat bacon, but had to make an exception and glad I did.We were brought two large shrimp as a bonus and they were very good. Since we were here for the steak, we ordered the fillet  and it did not disappoint.  Perfectly medium rare.  Seemed bigger than the 10 oz. listed and was very good.  I am normally s New York Strip fan, but this was good.   In fact the bottom of the fillet was frankly succulent.  We ordered the fries and the spinach.  The fries were good, but not exceptional.  The creamed spinach was very good.  We also were brought the mac and cheese, which I really had wanted to try, although not one of my favorite dishes to order.  It was definitely good here.For dessert the tiramisu and  the cream puffs.   Both were good, although not exceptional, but I tend to like a chocolate dessert anyway.  Preferred the tiramisu.We were some of the last to leave and were very nicely bid good night.All in all a Yelp experience to really Yelp about.  For value received both Yelp and Club A get 5 stars.",0,0,0,Randall S.,"Manhattan, NY",837,109,13
5.0,1/12/2012,"My husband and I went to this restaurant for the first time last night as part of a Yelp deal for a 4-course meal that we bought. You never know what you're going to get when you buy a deal and.... WOW... we were more than pleasantly surprised with the whole experience!!We stepped into the restaurant and it immediately had a warm, cozy feel. There were a few fireplaces which I totally loved. The music volume was only a tiny bit loud, but definitely not overpowering. We were greeted by who we later found out was the owner, Bruno Selimaj, who asked us for the Yelp coupon which we presented. A nice hostess also took our coats. Bruno welcomed us and asked if we wanted to sit downstairs or upstairs. He looked at us and had that look of ""ah, it's your first time"" so he showed us the upstairs which was so beautiful and romantic. No brainer there. It had such a unique and pretty red fabric ceiling, chandeliers, red accents and long thin candles on the tables. We were given a choice of sitting at a cushiony booth right next to a party of four or a table a bit further away, the latter of which we chose. Our table overlooked the street level and was right in front of a tree with Christmas lights, which, we later found out that they leave on all year round because it is so pretty. Definitely added to the already beautiful ambiance. The team of extremely attentive wait staff immediately made their way to our table, putting the napkin on my lap and asking if we want bottled or tap water. They were so organized that they had a menu customized for the Yelp deal which had all the choices on it, I think at the top it said ""Club A Loves (with a heart symbol) Yelp"" or something like that. A nice touch. Our cabernet sauvignon that came with our deal was opened and poured into a lovely decanter for the table. A beautiful bread basket came out too. I think that is always so nice to have, I wish more restaurants did this as a general practice. For our apps I had the calamari which was nice and tender with a light breading, very flavorful. It was served with a slightly spicy red marinara sauce - delish. My husband had the mixed greens which were good. Alongside our apps they brought us another dish  - shrimp cocktail, compliments of the house! The shrimp were huge, nothing shrimpy about them at all. Tasty cocktail sauce. Next, another complimentary app - lobster ravioli! It was so scrumptious and not too rich, so flavorful. We really felt like we were getting the royal treatment even though technically we were the ""coupon couple"". (However later we saw more couples come in who were also presented with what looked like the same bottle of wine, and the 'deal menu', so we were not alone). Well there was no doubt about it, they definitely were impressing us to get us to return again. It was very obvious that they were a very hardworking establishment. There was enough time in between courses too, they didn't rush the food over too much. Next came our main courses, we both wanted to try the steak since it was a steakhouse (how can you not??) I had the filet mignon medium rare which was cooked perfectly to my liking, with Yukon whipped potatoes that were so smooth and creamy, I wish I had ordered a second helping! My husband had the hangar steak which was also cooked perfectly and served with a delicious sauce. He ordered the garlic fries which were also good. Another complimentary side dish was brought out - creamed spinach with truffle oil. We each tried it but didn't really like it that much, then again neither of us are creamed spinach fans. Also the smell was a bit strong too. Still, having one dish out of the whole meal be not to our liking was amazing. The fact that they kept bringing us complimentary foods was really going the extra mile. I cannot emphasize enough how great the wait staff was. If they had been more attentive it would have been borderline annoying. I'm sure restaurants constantly try to find the right balance of giving enough attention while also allowing a couple to enjoy their alone moments during a romantic meal together. We both appreciated the effort and we definitely felt treated very, very well. We were also visited by the owner later in our meal. He was so nice and asked if we were enjoying everything. We told him this was such a nice place, great food, great service, we were so happy. He also showed us a room in the back where people can book parties. It was also beautiful. We were getting so full that we asked if they could pack our desserts to go. They graciously accomodated. I got the cream puffs and my husband got the tiramisu, both of which were very tasty. When we got home we discovered our final surprise which was, you guessed it! A complimentary dessert! A slice of carrot cake! Tasty. So it goes without saying that we were incredibly happy with our first experience here. We hope to return one day would highly recommend this place to anyone!",0,0,0,Holly R.,"New York, NY",7,9,2

5.0,1/9/2012,"'When you're at Club A, you're family.' At least... that might as well be this resto's mantra, because it's exemplified in the service that -everyone- on staff here delivers.Nearly a year later (and less than a month before it expired), we finally had an opportunity to use the Yelp Deal the boy purchased back in early 2011. And -man- was it worth the $80 for a three-course dinner for two people, plus a bottle of wine.... but that wasn't all! In addition to the bacon (don't miss it) and Caesar salad starters, the house sent out a lobster ravioli and some massive prawns as well. Along with our fillet and osso bucco mains, we were proffered some extra sides of buttery mashed potatoes and potatoes au gratin. And as if we weren't already stuffed beyond reason, the kitchen sent us an extra carrot cake on top of the two desserts we already had.Needless to say, I waved my white flag of surrender well before making a dent into our final course, and I only have the boy's strong constitution (and growing love handles) to thank for finishing the last bites of our meal, which could only be described with the word 'excessive'.Even without the Yelp Deal (which, if you must know, is priced at half the value of the meal, sans freebies), it'd be a pretty reasonable value. And if they take care of you like this when you're paying half price, I can't begin to imagine what it's like when you're not...",11,3,7,Kevin L.,"New York, NY",1049,1344,4648
5.0,1/8/2012,"My husband and I had the pleasure of dining in this wonderful restaurant twice. This place stands up to its name as it truly is an ""A"" list steakhouse. First and foremost I would like to point out their customer service is outstanding, the staff and the owner went above and beyond to make sure we were enjoying our meal and having a great dining experience. I may be old-fashioned, but I really value such high-quality customer service and I believe places with these standards will go far.The environment is very chic and intimate. Love the live music too. And the place is spotless. We got a special table during our second visit, on the 2nd floor by the floor-to-ceiling window. We had a nice view of the beautifully decorated block with lit up trees, very nice. Our waiter for the night was Frank and I would like to mention that he was excellent. He was friendly, yet very professional and attentive, and always made sure we were happy with our meal choices. As for the food, it is nothing but outstanding. Probably one of the best dining experiences we have had so far. Food was delicious both times.During our first visit we used our Living Social coupon. My husband had a thick slice of bacon as an appetizer, which he said was excellent - I tasted it too, it was really good. I had their soup of the day - it was cauliflower soup and it was absolutely delicious, I loved it, the flavors were spot on. As the main course we both had a filet mignon (well done) - I had it with mashed potatoes and my husband had the garlic fries - again, delicious. Then we had their Tiramisu desert which was truly divine. During our second visit we both had the soup of the day as an appetizer - it was mushroom soup and it could not have been any better. For the main course we went with Frank's recommendation and tried their signature Porterhouse steak (medium-well) - we never eat our steak medium-well but Frank explained it's much more enjoyable that way and we were glad we listened. It was exceptional. Very tender and flavorful. We loved it. It was a masterpiece. The lovely Cabernet Sauvignon definitely enhanced the experience. We shared 3 sides - mashed potatoes, garlic fries and mac & cheese. All were delicious. My husband couldn't stop talking about the mac & cheese. He said he had never had better mac & cheese and this was coming from a very picky mac & cheese eater.While we were enjoying our deserts - Tiramisu (my husband) and Creme Puffs (me), which were very good, Frank surprised us with a very special desert - in front of our eyes he cooked what I later discovered was the most delicious creme ever and he poured it over fresh berries. It was heaven.I was so impressed by the amazing service that night. This place deserves all the stars. Highly recommended!",1,0,0,Veronika B.,"Jersey City, NJ",1,39,10
4.0,1/8/2012,"It's been over a year since I first heard about Club A and I have been yearning to go ever since, so last night I was quite excited that the time had finally come!The ambiance is really lovely.  The decor is warm and inviting. I loved all the rich red tones that they used.  We walked in and were shown to our table on the second floor, which was pretty; especially seeing the lit up trees outside the window.We started off with the Club A Royal Platter, which had shrimp, crab and lobster cocktail.  This was a perfect size to share and was quite good.  The cocktail sauce needed a bit more heat and acid since it was a little on the sweet side, but the aioli served with the plate was delicious.  A great start to the meal.Entrees we tried the rib eye and the hanger steak.  Both were ordered at medium and  were cooked fairly well, but medium rare may have been a better way to go.  The rib eye was delicious.  Tender with a great savory flavor.  The hanger steak was good, but a bit tough.  The peppercorn sauce was delicious and added a nice layer of flavor to the meat.  The steak sauce was reminiscent of the cocktail sauce we had with the appetizer and was just too sweet.  We opted for 3 sides, the Whipped Yukon Potato Puree which was silky and indulgent; the creamed spinach was yummy and the roasted mushrooms had a touch of truffle oil and were a perfect compliment to the meat.The wine list was OK, but we opted to bring a bottle of our own and were charged a $25 corkage fee. As soon as we sat the waiter offered to open our bottle and decant it for us.Whenever I see zabagione on a menu I am compelled to order it, so I did.  Made table side and served over berries, it was good, but lacking some flavor.  Not the best I've had but I wouldn't call it bad.  The profiteroles were OK as well.  I don't think dessert is their forte and they focus on the other courses which is fine by me.Service was friendly and attentive.  On each table is a white taper candle, once the couple seated next to us left their candle was blown out and my husband got covered in wax.  After we had paid, I just let the waiter know what had happened (I mean they should be careful about blowing wax everywhere), anyway they were quite apologetic and offered to buy us an after dinner drink, which I thought was nice.All in all it was a lovely meal in a warm cozy setting.",0,0,0,Krista M.,"Kew Gardens, NY",353,719,289
4.0,1/7/2012,"We came here with a Yelp deal we bought awhile ago. We read all the great reviews about service and food with the deal, and they were totally true!We were seated upstairs. Right away we were given menus, bread and offered a drink and our bottle of wine. The wine was included with the deal and they put it in this funky carafe. As far as wine, it wasn't the best out there, but it was good (we had the red).The menu had a lot of selections. I think there were two salads, soup and two or three others to choose from for appetizers. There were at least five entrees (two were steaks). There were four sides to choose from and two desserts.We had:Appetizer-fried calamari (pretty good with a somewhat spicy dipping sauce)-sliced canadian bacon (very good, a bit fatty, but tasty)-complementary shrimp cocktail (the biggest shrimp I've ever seen with traditional cocktail sauce and a mayo based one that tasted like horseradish)Entree-complementary lobster ravioli (two pieces of delicious, overstuffed ravioli with chunks of lobster on the side)-filet mignon, 10oz (cooked a little more than I'd like and a bit blackened on the outside with minimal spicing. It was good but not great)-veal (with a creamy sauce, served over rice. It was really good and a huge portion. Very tender and delicious)Sides-mac and cheese (very garlicky, a little too much so, but very cheesy and creamy-pureed potato (so creamy, so delicious)Dessert-cream puffs (very good homemade cream, nice sauce and a large portion)-tiramisu (very good)-complementary carrot cake (not very moist, loved the cream cheese frosting)All of that food and we were utterly stuffed. We took some of the leftovers home. It wasn't the best steak house we've ever been to, but the food was very good and the service made the experience fantastic. We were there on a pre fix deal and I felt that we were treated better than those paying regularly. Yes, we didn't have all the options of the main menu, but there were many, very pleasing options that we had nothing to complain about. The timing of the courses and in between each course was perfect. I can't say enough about the service. They weren't too in our faces, not too aloof. All of this for $80 (plus tax and tip).

4.0,1/7/2012,"The best part about this place is the classic steakhouse dishes in which your sides are served (think deliciously creamy spinach in a piping hot mini casserole dish). And not like those ""other"" steakhouses that give you your mashed potatoes in a foofy little soufflé ramekin - this is the type of place where you could make a whole meal out of the sides.  But then you would be missing the juicy steak. Lots of deals to be had with this steakhouse (see Yelp, Travelzoo, etc.), so it is crowded most nights.

Upon entry, the manager seated us in a decent location on the first floor. That was the highlight of the dinner. When I asked the server for recommendations, he told me every entree was good. I specifically asked about the osso bucco and was told it is good and very tender. He did not even attempt to develop rapport, I still wonder why I tipped 15%. He took all three course orders at the beginning of the meal and returned two times. Once was to bring our wine, the other time was to ask about our entrees. He did not seem to care that we did not enjoy them nor the salty side dishes. The dessert was flavorless and the osso bucco was removed from the table without question why I barely touched it. The manager spent his evening by the bar and I did approach him about the experience as I left. Overall, I would've been a lot happier going to a true steak house and paying double for a steak dinner. I read other reviews and was a bit confused as a lot of people had different experiences.

3.0,12/27/2011,"For a short Manhattan trip that I am currently taking with a sibling, I did a lot of researching on the top steakhouses in the area for us to visit. I ultimately settled on Club A due to the reviews I read, and was extremely excited for the visit. Unfortunately, it didn't truly deliver for me.A little about the decor, since some people seem to get really hung up over that sort of stuff. It was a somewhat smaller place, but certainly not cramped. Dimly lit, but not enough to be bothersome. It was, overall, a nicely laid out place.For appetizers, we started off with calamari and the bacon (due to the rave reviews). The bacon was amazing. I will probably never eat it again because it took three years off of my life, but it was essentially a fried piece of bacon/fat that was crispy, chewy, smokey, and delicious. Best thing I ate during the meal. The calamari was also good. It wasn't anything extraordinary, just calamari. It tasted fresh, and that's what counts.For sides, we got the garlic french frys, the sauteed spinach, and the truffle mac and cheese. The frys were.. eh. I wouldn't recommend ordering them. They weren't bad, they just weren't worth the money spent. I would rank them below fast food frys in terms of taste and texture, personally.The spinach and mac and cheese were both great. They were probably my second favorite part of the meal. The spinach still had a bit of crispness to it, which I liked, and a great garlic flavor. The macaroni had a great taste as well. My only complaint is that I wish they served a little more of it since it didn't go very far split two ways.For the main course, I got the aged ribeye and my brother got the aged strip. This is where it became a 2.5-3* meal, in my opinion.The strip steak tasted very good. However, it was (and I'm not exaggerating) as thick as a heavy book, and it was fairly raw throughout (asked for med-rare). According to my brother, the parts that weren't extremely raw was one of the best steaks he has ever eaten. I will agree that it was very good, and certainly one of the better cuts I've had. My steak, on the other hand, was a bit disappointing. For a $54 dry aged steak, I expect the best steak I ever ate. Period. I don't think this is unreasonable as the best steak I've had currently was somewhere in the neighborhood of $23-24 at a higher end steakhouse in my hometown.The steak was juicy (mostly). The first few bites I had were very dry and overcooked, but as I cut into it, it wound up being perfectly cooked throughout the rest of it. The problem was that it was just very bland. With a dry aged steak, I expect a very strong beef flavor, and it just wasn't there. The char was also a little overdone on certain parts, to the point where a few bites were very bitter and unpleasant. It wasn't a bad steak in the least, but it wasn't great. To be perfectly honest, I ate a steak the other day at a chain restaurant that was $16 and it tasted comparable.All in all, not a bad meal in the least. I'm just disappointed that my $54 cut of meat, the main part of the meal I was looking forward to, was disappointing. I never expected to enjoy a slab of bacon and some side dishes more than the dry aged ribeye steak at a steakhouse. I'm sure my steak was a fluke due to the overwhelming reviews on here, but with the $160 + tip tab we walked out with, it's not something I'm going to gamble with again on this trip.",1,0,0,Jeremy H.,"Rochester, MN",3,50,2

3.0,12/26/2011,"The cult following here from Yelp has gotten so ridiculous, that I just had to give this place a shot.  And honestly, I don't get why the following.  Yeah, if you have one of those yelp deals, it's a good deal, but are we judging it based on that price or the listed menu prices?  The thick cut bacon I think was just pure fat, which made it good, until I woke up the next day feeling a bunch of fat just sitting in my system.  The steak itself was good, but not out of this world like everyone's making it sound like.  Though the red sauce that kinda looks like ketchup, now that's something that deserves five stars.  Anyway, all in...yeah worth a shot if you get one of those coupons.  If you don't have one, I think there are better spots in this same price range.",3,0,0,David W.,"New York, NY",168,834,0
5.0,12/25/2011,"So we came to New York to celebrate a friends birthday, I had called in to make reservations for 9 people at first.  When we were in New York, I had to make last minute changes and add two more to our party.  They were still happy to change the reservation as well, the person I spoke with asked how I heard about them and I told them through yelp and that I was from the bay area. When we arrived we were seated immediately and they had our table ready.  They had live music playing which was awesome because the restaurant itself has that old classic NY look inside, dim lights, red walls and pictures.  I even saw the next Iron Chef Geoff Zakarian at the bar!We ordered our steaks and sides... of course our order was pretty big so I noticed that the steaks would take a while.  They brought over a complimentary plate of bacon and caprese salad.  WOW that slab of bacon was AMAZING!  Then afterwards we got our steaks and sides, my steak was cooked perfectly!  I did think it was a bit over seasoned for my palette and the sides were pretty good but not the best I've had.  We were all pretty stuffed and when they cleared the table they started bringing out the dessert menus, I was seriously to stuffed to even think about dessert.  Then all of a sudden they bring out two huge plates of desserts and two plates of fruit. WOW all for the birthday table.  That was AMAZING service!  We all left super happy and ready to hit up the night life!  I shook the owners hand and told him that I was very pleased with our experience.  Also, if you're taking someone here on a date, you should request the upstairs dining section because it is absolutely beautiful up there with the lighted tree and the dim lights.",1,0,0,David K.,"Cupertino, CA",791,1033,305

5.0,12/19/2011,"A bunch of friends and I went there for my birthday on a Saturday night and it was wonderful! We had gone last year as well and enjoyed it so much that we made sure we went back again this year. This time around we had people from all over - Chicago, DC, Philly, NJ, CT and Alabama. Since it was such a large group they put us in the wine cellar - which was perfect. It gave us a chance to talk and enjoy each other. The service is wonderful from the moment you walk in the door and they check your coat up through the time you leave and they call you a cab! They have a tasty wine list and plenty of wines by the glass which are a more than generous pour. But now onto the most important part of the evening - the food. The Onion soup was a great start - it was not too salty and had the perfect amount of cheese. We also indulged in the bacon (a smokey must have), crab cakes (excellent mustard sauce and large amounts of crab), truffle fries (can't go wrong with truffle anything), and the escargot (tender little garlicky morsels). Next came the steaks. Now imagine getting 12 steaks prepared at the same time with all the right temperatures.....well Mission Accomplished! I had the Prime Dry Aged Double Eagle Strip Bone-In. It had a deep meaty flavor from the aging which was delicious. Others enjoyed the filet and the bone-in filet (which was a special). The filet was fantastic; you could (and trust me I did) cut it with a butter knife. The bone-in filet had a bit of fat around it, but the bone gave it a deeper flavor than the regular filet. Everyone was very happy with their steak. We also ordered a couple of sides - I highly recommend the brussel sprouts - they're roasted, giving them a sweetness, and then accompanied by the previously mentioned thick bacon, giving them a salty, smokey side. The pan roasted mushrooms were a mix of oyster, shitake, and cremini's with a hint of tuffle oil and a perfect accompaniment to the steak. With such a large table we got all the sauces - but to be honest, I'm not a sauce girl - and preferred the steak by itself. Finally, as if we didn't eat enough, we got an array of desserts. The tiramisu was not soggy and had a light coffee (not too overpowering) flavor. The carrot cake had a fantastic cream cheese frosting with a hint of lemon. And finally those cream puffs were the perfect topper to the meal - not too sweet, just a little chocolate sauce and plenty of fresh whipped cream filling!Over all it was a fantastic meal and a spectacular night! Thanks Club A (Bruno and staff) for making my birthday perfect!",0,0,1,Chefanie L.,"New Haven, CT",1,9,1
5.0,12/18/2011,"First timers for this place and expectations were pretty high given the high ratings. After spending the day taking in the Radio City Christmas show and all of the other midtown Christmas sights, we arrived hungry. Bruno greeted us at the door as if we were old friends. We sat on the second floor overlooking the beautifully lit trees outside the window, The decor was warm and welcoming. Knowing we were in for a feast (plus a desire to save room for dessert), we decided to skip the appetizers and get straight to good stuff. We opted for the porterhouse for 3 along with three sides which turned out to be more than enough for me, my wife and our two boys (11 and 8 yrs old). However, as we waited, Bruno sent an order of Canadian bacon and order of calamari to the table, complements of the house. And were we ever glad he did. As others have said, the bacon was the best we've ever had. Our sons who are true carnivores gushed over it, but they would never touch calamari. Our server JT, promised that if they tried it and didn't like it, they could kick him in shins. Suffice it to say, JT walked away unscathed, and our kids, who have never eaten calamari before (although I eat it quite often), ate half the plate. The calamari really was really outstanding. Crispy outside and tender as can be inside. Then it was time for the main attraction. First, we heard it. From half way across the room, you could hear juices on the serving platter boiling as though it was still under the broiler. Then, the smell hits you. Intoxicating. And it looked just as good too with the juices continuing to sizzle for at least two more minutes on the table. It seemed like an eternity as we waited for the staff to fill our plates. But worth the wait as the taste sealed the deal. This was the best porterhouse we've ever had. Done perfectly. The sides of truffle mac & cheese, garlic herb fries and sauteed asparagus were all excellent. Dessert really put us over the edge. The chocolate mousse pie was killer. Rich and creamy, yet light as a mouse should be. A thin cookie crumb crust added the right touch. My wife had the profiteroles which were delicious as well. And I won't forget to mention the mini ice cream bomb that was sent courtesy of the house. More like chocolate and vanilla gelato coated in a dark chocolate shell.  Another winner,JT and the rest of our serving staff were on the ball the whole night. They didn't miss a beat. Thanks to all of them and Bruno's great hospitality, this was truly one of the best meals we've ever had. We can't wait to come back.UPDATE (Jan 2016) - just wanted to note that we come here at least three times each year. This is now the default restaurant for birthday dinners. My kids are now 15 and 12 and they still choose Club A over any other steakhouse not minding the 1+ hour trek in from Long Island. It's been just as good every time since my first review in 2011.

The service. Everyone here is exceptionally nice and make you feel extremely special. Tonight was my boyfriends birthday, and not only did they give us a free bottle of wine (they were out of the one we wanted), we also got 2 glasses of prosecco and dessert, on the house. 3. last but not least, the food. To start we got a slice of thick cut bacon, one is enough to share, for sure. It is served with the Club A steaksauce which is soooo yummy. Its like a mix between ketchup and bbq sauce..sweet and tangy. We wanted the kobe ribeye, but unfortunately they were out of it, so instead I got the short ribs which were served wtih gnocchi and my boyfriend got the porterhouse for one which is not on the menu, they made it special for him. For sides we got the creamed spinach and sauteed broccoli. Everything was amazing. I cannot say enough about how wonderful of an experience going to Club A is.

4.0,12/12/2011,This place is sooooo romantic! Paul H. took me here for my birthday and I loved every minute of it. There's a reason why this place is in business is because of their service and attention to detail. The owner noticed us shifting away from the fireplace (it was getting a little steamy in our intimate nook) and offered to turn down the flames. I loved that each table got their own candle. I enjoyed looking at other people's candle and gauging how long they've been sitting. I wished I had taken a time elapsed shot of our candle. :)The food was not as memorable but I think it could also be due to what we ordered. My filet mignon was overly charred but I was glad it was still pink inside. Thankfully it wasn't dry and very tender. I really liked the lobster ravioli. It was complimentary and I think I would order it as an entree the next time I return. The sides weren't very memorable. I just remember enjoying the calamari. I really liked the tiramisu and thought it was a perfect ending to an enjoyable meal.

The establishment was very accommodating and polite. There was a waiter present at all times during the evening for us to order food, drinks, or just water.

5.0,11/23/2011,"After reading my review, Bruno (the owner), contacted me because he was unhappy that I was dissatisfied with my main course, mainly my steak.  He invited me to return as his guest and offered the same as the living social deal I had purchased.  Since I enjoyed my first time at Club A, I decided to give it another chance.  They did not disappoint.  I was greeted by Bruno upon entering, but that isn't special treatment - everyone gets that treatment.  Many times I saw Bruno seating guests and ensuring their satisfaction.  We elected to sit in the lower level because they had a live jazz duo playing. BTW: They were excellent and made for such a relaxing experience.  We started our dinner with a Malbec - another, more expensive wine was offered as part of our dinner, but I really enjoy their Malbec regardless of price.  As I had stated in my previous review, their decanters are absolutely gorgeous and one of a kind.  They are blown glass and magnificent.  For appetizers, we selected the calamari and canadian bacon.  The calamari was perfectly cooked, crunchy, and seasoned (didn't even need the sauce).  The bacon -  it's bacon - perfect balance of meat and fat. :)  The sauce is a good accompaniment.  For the main course, we ordered a porterhouse for 2 at Bruno's recommendation.  It came out sizzling!  Generally, I dislike sizzling steaks (like at Ruth Chris) because it often times over cooks the steak.  Not the case at Club A; it came out perfectly cooked and remained that way throughout the course of the dinner.  The waiters prop the plate so that the natural juices of the steak do not over cook it.  Nice touch.  It came out sliced which was an added touch of presentation, and the waiters individually prepared our plate.  The steak was perfectly seasoned and cooked (medium rare).  Of course, I preferred the filet portion of the porterhouse, but the NY Strip section was pretty tender as well.  The sides of sautéed jumbo asparagus, mashed potatoes, and creamed spinach were delicious and of good portion.  At this point, we decided to go for a second bottle of wine. Why you say?  Because we were thoroughly enjoying ourselves.  And if we weren't full enough, Bruno surprised us with a sampler of desserts and a fruit platter!!! (Must see pics)  We tried some of everything because it was all amazing (don't judge).  There were decadent cream puff pastries, tiramisu, absolutely delicious cheesecake, and chocolate coated ice cream (I cannot recall the exact name of these).  Again, AMAZING!  We had to take the fruit to go, but it was a great snack the next day.  Needless to say, we rolled out of Club A; we were FULL.  The food was excellent and the service stellar.  It's probably safe to say that everything tastes excellent in this establishment.  I strongly recommend.  I have been to a lot of steak houses and am very picky.  But based on my two experiences at Club A Steakhouse, the quality, taste, and ambiance make it a strong contender in NYC.

We not sure he was the owner or not, but after dinner, we went downstairs at bar area, and we saw many photos between him and his family, which is why we thought he might be the owner, very unusual, because I never once went to a restaurant that owner seem to care so much about his customers opinions, which I thought is greatAfter our dinner, we're about to take off, everyone is so full, but when we asked for the check, the waiter said we would like to give you all a complimentary dessert. We all was just looking at each other huh? All 4 of my friends and I got a very tasty tiramisu. Mm..... sitting here thinking about it, I would like to have some now. lol But the bad thing is, I was so...full, I cannot finish it!!! Yes, that's bad, cuz is so...GOOD!! lolWe don't know what we did to deserve the complimentary dessert, but I do know they're smart business people, because now when my friends and family ask me about a good steak house, I will tell them ""Club A"" good food and excellent serviceIf you're in the area, make sure you look this place up, and also make sure you save some room for the dessert",1,0,0,Kenny T.,"Las Vegas, NV",49,196,34

4.0,11/20/2011,"This is a beautiful, romantic restaurant with excellent service and good food. We came here with a livingsocial and were happy to see that they had truly embraced the deal. Many restaurants look down on patrons with deals and do their best to hide the fact that they signed up it. A's steakhouse, seemed to embrace it. They created a separate Livingsocial menu, which featured a lovely prix fix selection of appetizers, entrees, sides and dessert.The rolls were yummy, but it would have been nice if the butter had been softer. We started with the calamari and the caesar salad. Although both were good, the breading on the calamari continually fell off as we picked them up with our forks, which was very frustrating. The salad was nothing remarkable, but tasty nonetheless. Boyfriend then had the filet mignon and I had the veal osso bucco. The filet mignon was cooked far too rare for our liking, but we decided to suck it up and just eat it. I think the steak could have used a sauce because it fell a little bit flat. The osso bucco on the other hand was delicious. The meat literally fell off the bone--yum!We had the creamed spinach and the mac'n cheese sides, both of which were overwhelmed by the truffle oil. I wish they hadn't had such a heavy hand with it because it really overwhelmed the palate. And for dessert, we had the tiramisu and the cream puffs-both delicious, light and refreshing after such a heavy meal.

The owner himself brought us over to our table in the main dining room along with the wine I'd gotten at the bar. The waiter came over quickly, lit a candle, presented us with our bottle of wine and asked if we would like it in a decanter. Let me just say that the decanter was stunning! After a few minutes our waiter took our order and would check on us every so often mostly to refill my glass.Okay the food! Sooooo good. I had the filet and my bf the hanger steak. Yum! Cooked just the way we wanted and seasoned well. The presentation left a little something to be desired. It was just steak on a plate with a sprig of parsley and the bf's came with some sauce.  I understand that the steak should speak for itself but a little something extra would have been nice.   As for sides I got the truffle oil infused creamed spinach and the bf the mac and cheese. Both very good. For dessert the only options were tiramisu or cream puffs so we got both naturally. It wasn't the best dessert I've ever had but it was yummy.

First, we shared our courses of crispy calamari with homemade cocktail sauce and beef tartare with mesclun green. Second, Roasted Pork Chops and Filet Mignon. Creamed spinach and Mac and cheeseFor dessert we had the Tiramisu and Cream Puffs. The Calamari was over cooked and chewy, although the cocktail sauce was somewhat flavorful. The steak tartare looked as if they ran it through a food processor and had too much sweet pickles. The Filet of beef which was ordered medium rare was delivered medium and the pork chops which were ordered medium was medium well.  Each had absolutely no seasoning what so ever and had to be drowned in their steak sauce, which tasted like a homemade mixture of ketchup and cocktail sauce. The cream puffs and tiramisu lack distinctive flavors as well.    I fully understand that this was a prefixed menu but if the chef and owner expect to have return patrons they should invest in creating  more flavorful dishes.I will not recommend or return to this restaurant.PS.

The sides were really good: creamed spinach, asparagus, mushrooms, etc. Wine was great. Ordered a $55 bottle of chiraz and tasted awesome. My only complaint was - contrary to some of these bad reviews - the service was too FAST. They were immediately hawking around our table for finished plates even when they weren't done. I wanted to save my bacon, but the guy kept asking me if i was done. However, they do bag it up really quickly for you if you request it.

4.0,11/2/2011,"A steakhouse that goes beyond that boys' club feel, this impressive Midtown East restaurant is more of a romantic than it lets on. Between the striking, ever-present red decor, the series of black and white framed photographs geometrically assembled and allocated across the establishment walls, and the white Christmas lights on their curbside tree peeking through the second floor glass windows, Club A Steakhouse achieves the ornate without the overkill. If there was an aspect of design where they attempted to skimp on the details, I couldn't find it.But let's take a step back for a moment. Seeing as this place has had a nearly unavoidable presence across multiple social media vehicles, I can't lie - I had my reservations about the joint. There was the I'd-be-crazy-to-pass-this-up LivingSocial deal for $80 that included a four-course dinner for two and a bottle of wine. There was the now-infamous Elite ravaging of March '11, further proving by the growing popularity of both Yelp and Club A Steakhouse, that there is no such thing as bad press. And then there's the general distrust from our info-before-experience generation of a hyped-up anything that appears to have gotten too big for its britches.Well, fear not, virtual friends, for my first-hand Club A Steakhouse encounter was pretty fantastic. With discount voucher in hand, I never once felt any sort of inferior treatment from the wonderful staff, never once felt like we were being rushed out the door*. In fact, to harp upon the romantic bit once again, I'd say the tempo of our meal was deliberately slower and more anxiety-free than what I typically experience when paying full price elsewhere and having dishes from course after course piling up on one another. And this change of pace is a good thing. Because really, when's the last time you allowed yourself the opportunity to sit down and truly enjoy the company of your loved one without wondering what time it was? Well, the red wine helped in that department too, I suppose.Anyway, onto the food. The Filet Mignon was a beautiful cut, cooked precisely as requested, but also more tender than flavorful. It could've used a bernaise or bordelaise or hollandaise or any old 'aise, but that's also my aise's fault for not asking. Any Sizzling Canadian Bacon offering at Gotham steakhouses are a must, and Club A's truly lives up to its ""extra thick"" description, arriving upon your plate as more of a block than a slice. It was, however, a bit fattier than most slabs I've had around town. The 5 Cheese Truffle ""Mac"", which had come at the recommendation of our server, was a delicious reminder how good this seemingly simple side can be before you start throwing bacon bits and lobster chunks in there (although, please - don't get me wrong, that's delicious, too). I appreciate Calamari Fritti that isn't 80% breading, where you can actually taste the squid a bit - as is the case with Club A's appetizer. The Creamed Spinach was a bit too creamy for my liking, but helped in my absence of steak sauces. And as if that wasn't enough, there was dessert. I thought my favorite was the Tiramisu, a really nice, relatively light, evenly liquored take on the Italian staple, but it was the Cream Puffs dish that I managed to scoop clean, probably due to my criminal lack of ice cream intake lately. Either way, you can't go wrong. Four gluttonous courses and one empty bottle of red later, I felt like I'd treated myself for sure, ready to pass out in the back of a cab (and I did).I only see this establishment continuing to build buzz and business, and perhaps fine-tuning their culinary prowess a bit to really bring them into the New York steak-joint big leagues. I like how a place with such a classy-meets-modern mentality as Club A has been adopted by a younger generation of carnivores as their flagship big-meat, big-date spot. All things considered, you can go 'head and tell those old crony steakhouses there's a new kid in town. Club A Steakhouse is on the up-and-up.*Not to sound like a dad, but please make sure you tip off the full amount if you've been budget-savvy enough to purchase one of these many internet deals. The waiters aren't treating you like 50% of a customer, you shouldn't treat them like 50% of a server. This lecture has ended. Carry on.",9,5,7,Dan R.,"Brooklyn, NY",633,551,148

4.0,10/24/2011,"My husband and I loved Club A Steakhouse.  We celebrated our two year anniversary and were treated like a King and Queen of the house.1) We used our Yelp deal for two, came with wine, appetizer, entree, dessert2) We were personally greeted by the owner and he would gently check in on us (we could tell who he was because he was practically in every picture around the restaurant)3) On top of our meal, we got a complimentary lobster ravioli in a rich cream sauce.4) We got the corner seat, which made it extra special.5) They caught wind it was our anniversary (probably from the time we made reservations and talking to the owner) and they decorated the dessert platter and also gave us champagne on the house.  Top it off with a card which we didn't even buy one another.Only problem we had was...the steak.  Not a spoiler for us but since it is a steakhouse we had to take one star away.  We asked for med rare and it came out a little bit too well done for both my husband and myself.  Great job Club A, you really made us feel like stars.",4,0,1,Christine K.,"New York, NY",93,222,27
5.0,10/23/2011,"I have been to this great restaurant 7 times now, and each time it continues to impress. No doubt about it, the value for the Living Social deal is unmatched and the food is absolutely incredible. The thick cut canadian bacon, the steak tartar, the fried calamari..all amazing. I've had the veal shank osso buco,  the 10oz filet, and the hangar steak...impressive. You can't go wrong with this place. We showed up with a party of 20 for my sister's 40th birthday party, the staff including the owner himself (Bruno) were all extremely friendly and also super helpful. Even though we may not have been paying full price, we were still treated like royalty in that place, Bruno set us up with a huge private room upstairs with a glass enclosed wine room, ornate molding on the walls, and a massive balcony overlooking 58th street. This place is amazing. Do yourself a favor and check it out as I will be continuing to frequent this great restaurant. Bravo, Bruno to a job well done.",0,0,0,Andrew S.,"Toms River, NJ",0,3,0
5.0,10/23/2011,"Talk about meant to be...so we plan on eating here anyways during our trip to NYC, and lo and behold there is a Living Social coupon for dinner for 2 for $69!!!  Not far from our hotel on 57th, we arrive at 7:30 and it was nice to see it was mostly full, and seated promptly.  Live jazz band was a good touch for the ambience.Best thing about their LS menu was that it has many items to choose from, unlike most prixe fix menus.  A good assortment of starters, entrees, sides.  Dessert was choice between tiramisu and creampuffs which was fine since I love Profiteroles and the missus loves tiramisu so we were covered.We both started  with salads, which come out in a very generous portion.  Also the nice thing about the LS menu is that the portions are normal ""retail menu"" portions.  Filet is 10oz, not a small cut that many prixe fix offer.  Needless to say when the steaks came out they were awesome.  Perfectly cooked filet, easily one of the best and I've been to a lot of established steakhouses.  You cut thru it like butter and was seasoned well, cooked perfectly.  The missus' hangar steak was also great, and perfectly cooked.  Sides of macaroni and mash potatos good, tho next time I'd get the creamed spinach instead of the mac.Overall service was fine, tho our waitress seemed to disappear half way thru dinner, I dont know if she was off the clock, but it is normal practice to let her diners know there is a change in waitstaff, as a result it took a few minutes to get our bill, but overall wasnt a big deal and the food spoke for itself.  We'd def come back even without the LS coupon, as you get a top notch meal.",3,0,0,Jason H.,"Pasadena, CA",217,406,342
5.0,10/22/2011,"Back in May I bought a Yelp deal ($80 for a 4 course meal w/ a bottle of wine) for Club A Steakhouse and we didn't get around to using it until tonight. Now we're kicking ourselves! WOW, what a place. I literally had no expectations walking in, I just thought, we'll give it a shot it's a good deal. When we left my husband and I felt spoiled, completely satisfied and excited to come back and try the full menu! First, let me tell you; the space itself is completely underrated on their site. None of the pictures I've seen even come close to capturing how lovely the space is. The place is elegant, comfortable and very romantic. I'm not sure what we did to deserve it but the owner (Mr. Bruno) sat us on the 2nd floor in this cozy, spacious booth with pillows and the best view in the house!  Everyone was attentive and helpful. The service was probably the best I've received in any restaurant I've been in for some time. Our waiter was friendly and checked on us frequently. Mr. Bruno was also circulating throughout the place during the course of our meal. The food was delicious and an excellent value. From the pre fix menu for the deal I had the calamari appetizer, salmon entrée and mac and cheese side. My husband had the steak tar tar appetizer, filet and garlic fries side. Everything was incredibly tasty! We both had the tiramisu for dessert which was arguably some of the best either of us had ever had. Again, not sure why Mr. Bruno was so kind to us (not that I'm complaining) but he also sent out a complimentary yummy ice cream dessert.  We will definitely be back to try something from the full menu, it was hard to ignore all the other amazing things we saw go to the other tables. Club A is a class act. If you want to try a new place I wholeheartedly recommend you give it a shot.",2,1,2,R S.,"Portland, OR",4,87,9
3.0,10/22/2011,"Yelp defines 3 stars as A-OK - and that is what Club A was.  We were using the prepaid Yelp deal ($80 for 2 apps, 2 entrees, two desserts and a bottle of wine).  Having lived a couple of blocks away for 8 years, it was time to give it a try.The service was great. Friendly and attentive.  The ambiance was a bit dated, but definitely upscale and nice for a date night.The fixed menu (they gave us a Living Social prix-fixe menu which I assume was the same as Yelp) was not tiny, but still limiting.  The sides, for example, were all heavy creamy sides like creamed spinach, mac and cheese, whipped potatoes.  The desserts were either cream puffs or tiramisu, and the wine was ""red or white"".The Canadian Bacon app (not sure why it's called Canadian bacon since they don't seem to eat that in Canada?) was delicious. Like a ham steak. And my steak (the hangar) was perfectly fine though nothing special flavor-wise - maybe a bit bland.  And I finished off that delicious truffled mac and cheese (though as a true Yelper, I think it would have been even better with a better pasta vs the simple elbows)But what we really felt was that we didn't enjoy the place with the deal as much as we would have for the same $80 because we had to get this or that. We didn't need two apps and we didn't need two desserts. But she would have had a different entree if not for the deal and we probably would have had different sides and split one good dessert.  It would be nice if you could even pay a supplement to buy up to other menu choices.I also think all these deals waters down the perception of Club A. My email is just full of Yelp deals, Living Social deals, etc for Club A. Every couple of months they sell a new round.So I bet I would have given it 4 stars if we could have really ordered what we wanted, but with the deal, I have to give it 3.",0,0,1,Dave G.,"New York, NY",26,68,15

2.0,10/19/2011,"Another example of how an online deal can turn out to be a disappointing fail.It was hard to resist the Living Social $40 for $80 worth of food deal (4 courses + bottle of wine), so we were pretty excited when we arrived and promptly plied with a nice bottle of cab.The appetizers were really delicious: you can't go wrong with steakhouse bacon, as the thick, succulent cut served here proved to be true; and the steak tartare was a savoury delight punctuated with just enough notes of acid to balance the dish.The sides were also good:  I loved how the truffle oil just permeated the creamed spinach, and the mac and cheese was better than most (but still a far cry from standing favourite La Laiterie).  So why the two star review?  When I come to a steakhouse, I expect the meat to shine, and shine they did not.  We ordered both the hanger and the 10 oz filet, and neither seemed to impress.  All I could think about was how much more amazing the hanger was at a non-steakhouse restaurant like Hudson Clearwater, and how the filet was clearly not as tender as I expect a filet to be.  Execution wise, both steaks were cooked perfectly to the requested temperatures with a perfect sear.  But for the overall experience, this is definitely not what I expected from what appears (as per many other reviews) to be a highly touted steakhouse.By then, I had lost interest in the desserts and just spent the rest of the night reminiscing about the amazing thick-cut bacon and steak tartare appetizers.  Perhaps I am overly jaded by previous bad experiences with Restaurant Week meals and other online ""deals"", but I guess I can't help but wonder if Club A brought anything less than their A game for those who come in with a coupon deal.",3,0,3,Dan T.,"New York, NY",111,430,157
4.0,10/16/2011,"Living Social Coupon Alert!!The great deal came into my inbox on Thursday, so I called immediately to see if it could be redeemed on Sat night. The sweet gal on the phone, told that she would give us the same deal for $69(Party of two gets two entrees, two apps, and two desserts off of a small pre-fixe menu). Deal was we would pay the restaurant directly.Done! 7pm reservation turned into a 7:15 or so seating, but my request for upstairs seating was fulfilled. If you want a nice romantic date night, ask for the upstairs; wow! Beautiful white lights surround both the front and the back section, and on the ledges you get to check out some of the most fascinating decanters I've ever seen! Very cool.Positives- VERY attentive service, very kind people, excellent timing of all dishes, the filet nailed it, the truffle spinach blew our minds, and the wine list had a very large choice of wines. Finally, Bruno, the owner, came by and offered us all a round of drinks on the house. He was a super nice guy and that says a lot of about how much he loves his restaurant and supports this staff. He was ALWAYS wandering around.Not so positives- Our party asked for a wine sommelier, and they didn't have one, but worse, the waiter didn't seem to know what a sommelier was? And he said he could help with the wine list but wasn't very helpful. Another gentlemen came by and did a beautiful pour of the wine into a crazy looking decanter and told us how nice our choice was. The hanger steak was meh. The total bill came up to the $69 plus a $80 out of nowhere and the bottle of wine. They took off the $80 without question, but a little strange how it got there?

2.0,10/16/2011,"Living Social deal.  Deserves 1 star but the service was good so I bumped them up. Food and drinks were pretty bad.  Four out of five people in my party were dissatisfied. Be warned: All Living Social diners eat upstairs and are given a stained, flimsy one-page print out of the available menu for the deal. Regular menu diners eat downstairs. I guess it avoids the awkwardness of menu mixups.  Not a bad idea.  But for a supposedly upscale restaurant they should have at least tried to make a good first impression by having decent looking menus.  Just unappetizing to have to hold stained copy paper.APPS: Plenty of options for the deal but nothing too good. Tried the steak tartare and caesar salad.  Salad was pretty plain.  Steak tartare was presented nicely but had huge chunks of pickles that gave it an unpleasant texture.ENTREES: Veal shank was a good choice. Very tender. Unfortunately, the rest of us had hanger steaks. Awful. Overcooked and served with a bowl of weird sauce/gravy that was white and aggressively peppery. Never seen anything like it before. Not one person liked it. Thank goodness they didn't drizzle it over the steak. The sides dishes were the best part of the entree. Creamed spinach was good, not overly rich. Mac and cheese was good but not good enough to make up for bad steak at a steakhouse.DESSERT: Cream puffs and tiramisu.  Cream puffs were filled with Cool Whip-like substance and then drowned in fluffy, mousse-like chocolate sauce.  Not too appetizing.  Tiramisu was adequate.DRINKS: Don't expect a cocktail menu.  Also, don't expect them to be able to make a cocktail.  Sidecars, vodka martini, manhattan: forget it.  They don't know how to make them. Don't waste your money because they used cheap alcohol despite the fact that we specified the brands we wanted.  I think this is to encourage diners to order wine.  About 75% of the wine list is wines over $75 per bottle.  Not good bottles either. Totally overpriced with very few choices under $50. BOTTOM LINE: May give the regular menu a try but no more coupon deals. May not even be worth it since the wine list was so overpriced and they can't make a decent cocktail. Wouldn't bring clients there because too much chance for disappointment.",2,0,2,Tess D.,"Hoboken, NJ",2,83,81

So we had to wait at the bar and have some drinks. The beautiful bartender took great care of us. She whipped me up her own potent sangria, which is just what i needed.Despite having to wait a while for our table, which was no fault of the restaurant as I had only called in reservations a few hours earlier, we got seated and were promptly served. We were given a special menu to choose from for our meal, but we weren't charged extra when i asked for a second side order to go with my steak. The steaks were cooked perfectly and tasty, as were the sides and the bottle of wine. I had both the Mac & Cheese side and the garlic fries. I also had the Canadian bacon appetizer. For desert, i went for the cream puff. This was also very good; a crispy puff pastry and french cream but not soggy.We will be back again and i hope they'll put up another Yelp deal in the future!

The decor is what you would expect from a 5 star restaurant; nice decanters, a fresh rose for your table, excellent glassware, a plush table right next to a large plate glass window, music which added to the mood without impairing the ability to have a conversation. We started with Canadian Bacon and Caesar Salad and both were absolutely delicious. Big thick cuts of bacon with an excellent home made steak sauce to go with it. I can't necessarily speak for the other members of my party (although all of us agreed the food was excellent), but I ordered a filet mignon and I was extremely impressed. I'm very consistent with my orders at steak houses; a filet mignon, butterfly cut, very well done. Generally this is an order that is never fulfilled, either far overcooked or far undercooked.What really sold me on the place though was the service. The servers were extremely attentative without being intrusive and the pace of the meal was perfect. We also had the opportunity to meet the owner, Bruno.

However, once we were there, it was clear that we were not their top priority, presumably because we were there for the deal and therefore would not be their highest paying customers. The atmosphere was lovely and the jazz downstairs (where we did not get to sit) sounded great. Servers were all very polite, but service was extremely slow. We waited half an hour for our appetizers and after those were taken away, we waited another 45 minutes for our main courses, while we watched others around us receive their food quite promptly. That said, the fried calamari, mashed potatoes, and filet mignon were all outstanding. Really, really delicious. The caesar salad, hanger steak, spinach and desserts were good.

5.0,9/29/2011,"I can't wait to come back again! =) I got the deal through Livingsocial for a 4 course prefix meal with wine/sangria for two. I was so excited about dining at this restaurant with my boyfriend when I checked yelp and read the good reviews. It has been awhile since I have been to a nice upscale restaurant that doesn't disappoint on the food, customer service and ambiance altogether.Once i stepped into the door, live jazz music filled my ears. The main level was pretty loud with the people talking and the music. The host led us upstairs to our table and it was so perfect. It was a beautiful quiet atmosphere with romantic songs like Frank Sinatra playing and our waiter led us to the tables and even asked us which table we would prefer. I love that we were given the option to choose our table and so we chose the one near the windows. The windows are really big and all you see are the lights from the trees. The red walls, the windows, the red couch with pillows, the lit candlestick with a rose on the table, and the chandeliers hanging above just put me in such a good mood and felt like Christmas.  Our waiter was so awesome. My boyfriend asked about some of the choices on the menu and he gave us informative answers and great suggestions. He was very professional and had a positive attitude. So for appetizers we tried the fried calamari and the steak tartare with arugula salad. The fried calamari was delicious and the sauce was extra tasty, it tasted homemade and had a nice spicyness to it. It was my first time trying steak tartare and now I'm in love with it. The texture of the tartare was light and flavorful by itself and when you eat it with the arugula salad, it added a nice bite, texture and nuttiness taste altogether. Next, the entree we had was Fillet Mignon and a veal shank. The side choices we ordered were the macaroni and cheese and the garlic fries. The steak was juicy and cooked so perfectly to my liking (medium-well) and although I am not a fan of veal itself, the veal was cooked well and tasty. The portion of the veal shank was a lot bigger than I thought it would be. There was a mistake on our order between the macaroni and cheese and the garlic fries. The macaroni and cheese was so garlicky and unbearable to eat. We let our waiter know and was given a new one with apologies. For dessert we had the tiramisu and cream puffs. Delicious, not too sweet and perfect choice for end of night. We ordered the cappuccino with our dessert as well. I only drink wine on special occasions so I do not know much about wine served here. For me, I enjoyed the red wine that they gave us because it was light, not too strong, and I can taste the sweetness that wasn't overbearing. Our water was constantly refilled, our table was cleaned after every dish, and the manager was walking around a lot to check to see if everyone was enjoying their meal and even asked every table personally.

I ordered the hanger steak which was perfectly cooked and came with a great dipping sauce, the creamed spinach was not overly creamy so it wasn't heavy and the cream puffs were a great ending to the meal.

The bartender was very nice, helpful and made a great drink. We moved to our table shortly after arrival and were greater immediately with great service. We ordered wine and our food. From the moment we sat at our table the weight staff was attentive and personalized. They checked with us often and always ensured that our wine glasses were full and our needs were met. For dessert we ordered the creme puffs. The weights staff being as attentive as they were found out we were on out anniversary and brought out a special dessert and their famous strawberry flambé on the house. Also included was a very nice card from the employees working tonight and glasses of champagne.The night couldn't have been any better for our anniversary. The staff was very personal and looked to make the night special for everyone dinning that evening. The owner even got involved and talked with each and every table present.Overall the experience was unbelievable and very much worth every penny.

5.0,9/21/2011,"I came with my gf using the Yelp deal. I've been to most of the good steakhouses in NYC but haven't tried Club A yet. The ambiance is very nice for a date unlike some other steakhouses which are much more rowdy (Wolfgangs/Lugers). The owner was there are talked to us before, during, and after our dinner. That was appreciated and I wish this was still the norm for restaurants everywhere.Food was top notch. We had the calamari as an appetizer and it was delicious. Before our meal came out, we got a complimentary crab stuffed ravioli which had huge pieces of crab in it - just the way I like it.We both love steak so we had to get the Filet - rare, the way it should be cooked! This filet is on par with any I have ever had. It is always tough to compare a filet to a porterhouse, so I prefer to keep the two separate. That said - at a nice restaurant like Club A, I got exactly what I expected: perfection. Extremely tender, sea salt on the sides, every bite a little piece of heaven.The sides included creamed spinach and mac n cheese. As others have mentioned, the spinach wasn't over creamy and was enjoyable, even though I'm not a huge spinach fan. The mac n cheese was awesome, hands down.Desert included cream puffs and tiramisu, both of which were great although my girlfriend and I agreed we should have gotten two of the cream puffs instead. I mean - tiramisu is tiramisu, even when it is done well. The cream puffs were something different and were wonderful. We couldn't finish the tiramisu since we were so full.My *only* complaint about the whole dinner was the bottle of wine which was not very good. We weren't exactly surprised since it was the house cab, but it is tough to drink bad wine with such a great meal. I let my gf order some better stuff and I polished off the house bottle =)Summary: If you are looking to impress a new girl, longtime girlfriend, wife, or family, take them to Club A steakhouse. You won't be disappointed.",2,0,0,Mike L.,"New York, NY",5,17,0
5.0,9/20/2011,"Every restaruant week, I make it a point to try a new steakhouse.  However, I broke my rule with this one... I came back twice.  The portions are huge, the steak is amazing, adn the sides are great.  With each steak you get potatoes and spinach, which compared to other steakhouses is very generous.  Aside from the great food, the staff and the owner really stand out.  They are so kind and always want to make your dinner special.  We went with a group of 6, my bf asked if his steak was medium rare, as ordered, becasue he felt that it looked a bit over cooked.  They assured him that it was (and it turned out that it was, must've been the lighting).  After eating a few bites, the owner came out with a second brand new steak for him.  I have never seen such generosity.  The restaurant itself is well decorated, dim and romantic but also great for groups.  I will be coming back AGAIN!",1,0,0,Kathy B.,"Manhattan, NY",121,7,0

5.0,9/14/2011,"Absolutely delicious! My girlfriend and I were visiting NYC and we enjoyed our last meal at Club A Steakhouse. Their double eagle new york strip steak was simply one of the best steaks Ive ever eaten in my life (Mastro's in Beverly Hills and N9NE in the Palms Casino in Vegas being close) and was very reasonably priced for a steakhouse in Midtown.We also ordered some truffle mashed potatoes, which were also excellent. We came to club A at around 9:30pm after a Yankee game and it was about to close. When we told them we were visiting from out of town, they brought us some delicious truffle mac and cheese on the house. I think they had already made it and were about to close, which is why it was gratis.Anyway, Id return on any future trip to NYC. I simply loved the food.

4.0,9/13/2011,"I'm being a little generous here because the people were very nice, and we had a great LivingSocial deal..whether that means LS should get more starts, is up to you. In sum, the service/ambiance is nice..the food to decent to moderately good. My bf purchased the LS deal that was $80 for a 4 course pre-fixe + a bottle of wine. There were a lot of choices on the menu: an app, a main, a side, and a dessert. More on this later. There were a lot of restrictions on the deal too (can use only Mon-Thurs, from 5-6, or 9 after.. something like that). But when my bf called to make dinner reservation at prime time- 8pm, they let him. The service is really nice. It's not as superb the way that people describe here but very prompt and cordial. They have a large waitstaff, so in my mind- there' s no excuse. The decor is nice. It's not stuffy like some of the other steak houses, and you can actually bring a date here- not reserved for client dinners only. It looks like a boudoir- all red. The space is pretty big too- upstairs and downstairs. Should have no problems for client dinners and other group things if you need it... Now. The FOOD. But first, the wine. Of course, it wasn't an expensive bottle, but it was not a bad cab. It was not too dry and smooth- I liked it. They ask you if you want red or white- that's all, and you get what you get. Can't speak for their white selection. The FOOD. Hands on, it's been said. GET THE CANADIAN BACON AS YOUR APP. Thickly cut, juicy, perfectly salted, and fatty... it was so delicious. It's bacon, with more fat- I don't need to describe more.  That is what my bf got.But I got the caesar salad, which was also really good. Lots of parm cheese savings, croutons, and romaine (not iceberg). No dressing- which is the way I like it. They had a mixed green salad, and I forgot what else as an app - nothing else but the bacon matters. Best thing I had all night. Onto the mains- these were the worst courses, actually. At least on my end. I don't eat steak, which may explain it. I got the brook trout- it tasted... too broiled. Like the fish you'd get at an old person's place.. it was mushy. It didn't taste very fresh..it was too sauced up, and had almonds and brocolini atop which was a bit misplaced, I thought. My bf got the veal osso buco--bone marrow on top and all. He told me it was really salty. But the bone marrow was good, as the veal. Just salty. It looked sauced.. and very brown. My fish, very.. off-white. I don't know about the presentation. For dessert, we both got tiramisu and it was really good. It nicely soaked in coffee liquor and had all the right ratios of mascarpone. Yum. The other option was a cream puff- meh. Key thing is, everything was paid for in the deal, and they weren't sour about us having one. Tax and tip not included.  Can't elaborate on their regular menu but my bf was eyeing people's steak all night, so I'm sure it's good.",4,2,2,Stephanie Y.,"New York, NY",878,1242,25

We ordered from a special menu - We started with the Bacon and Calamari. The bacon had a smokey flavor and with just the right amount of crispiness. TheCalamari was not over battered.  It was light and cooked right. Our main courses were the filet mignon and the hanger steak. They were cooked to perfection.  Our sides were creamy spinach- I'm glad that this was not overly creamy like steakhouses tend to be - and whipped Yukon potatoes - light and fluffy. We ended with dessert that we couldn't even finish - cream puffs and tiramisu- were tasty but we were just so stuffed at that point. Everything was just so tasty and good!

I had the filet, cooked medium. It could have used a little more seasoning but it was cooked PERFECTLY.  I added a little salt and pepper and it was delicious.  My friend had the salmon, which was also cooked wonderfully.  The whipped potatoes are to DIE for.  The cream puffs were all right - they were a little too flimsy and not a lot of cream in the center, but they were topped with a delicious chocolate mousse.  Upstairs is the better seating place I think, because they decorate the trees with lights outside and it makes the inside of the second floor glow.  Very romantic.We left, and i had to come back about an hour later because I left my umbrella there.  The owner asked us how we liked our dinner, and offered to buy us a glass of wine.  The bartender was really knowledgable about her wines and offered us a red that I've never heard of before, and since it was free I said, ""why not!"" and I'm so glad I did.  Delicious.  Thank you club A!",0,0,0,Leanne M.,"ASTORIA, NY",16,11,0

4.0,9/6/2011,"So I purchased 2 livingsocial deals because I am a sucker for a good steak and for some reason I just had a good feeling about this place.Upon entering, the ambiance is rather inviting and the living music was definitely a plus. both times me and my gf went, we were seated upstairs and both times with a cocktail that was nice and strong (find it a bit annoying when restaurants give you super light drinks) and reasonably priced.The waiters were helpful and were in tune with what a place of this caliber should be. Prompt with service, attentive, and cordial.Before going on I feel it pertinent that I let you know that for whatever reason, it's the little things that got me about this place--otherwise I give it 3.5 stars.The first time was after dark and though a touch loud, had a nice intimate setting. The place just makes you want to like it (if that makes sense). The second time we went it was a bit quieter being early in the evening and seemed a bit more casual--the natural lighting that comes in seems to make that difference.The first time the bread basket was a huge disappointment; it was cold and dry--almost like stale croutons. In my mind there was just not excuse for it--the second time the bread basket was fine. The butter is served hard and cold(for those that care)The steak knives are the thick wooden handled ones which for some reason bothered me--it just didn't seem to fit with everything in the restaurant. I would've liked to see something that better fit the classy theme of the place.The steak tartar was something I enjoyed. The Fried Calamari was well prepared ( not heavy with grease, texture was on point, and well seasoned), the bacon was....well...bacon... I don't know why I was expecting something else..I kind of hoped it to be a bit crispier on the edges--but these were not bad.Sides:The creamed spinach seemed to lack the uhh...Cream.... the potato's were a delight--light creamy and perfectly seasoned. The Mac and Cheese was almost a bad addiction as we tried our best but failed to get greedy with it.Entrees:I feel it unnecessary to tell you how good the filet was--we'll just say that it was on par with what a steak house should make it--seasoning was just right, the meat was cooked right (we like it medium rare) and it was just delicious.The osso bucco seemed a little shy on flavor and seemed a little dissapointing.The hanger steak was ok, the first couple pieces was wierd though... the texture of the meat was almost as though it was steamed--like over crowded meat or something...the texture or the meat was a touch chewy but the rest of it was fine.The pork chops were overcooked and dry which was a shame because I was really looking forward to trying this dish.Dessert:The tiramisu doesn't didn't quite taste like how it should but it was pretty good...the cream puffs were surprisingly better than I had anticipated as well.All in all, it seems to be small things that seem to hold it back. With the food, there seem to be some inconsistencies with execution, however, it's hard for me not to like this place.After the first dinner there, my gf expressed her concerns in a review and the owner/manager offered to make things right. Though we didn't accept that offer, ( we had a second living social deal anyways and I figured if it was bad I wouldn't want to come back and if it was good...well what's wrong with paying for it?) we appreciated the gesture. Too often we find places that simply don't care--here they seem to make a conscious effort to make sure your experience here is a good one.Overall I'd say 3.5 stars--I'll round up here because they just have that x factor that this place wont be wasted potential.",2,0,1,Alexander L.,"Brooklyn, NY",351,412,82

5.0,9/2/2011,"My BF and I celebrated our 2-year anniversary here for dinner during extended Restaurant Week and the service was unparalleled.  Honestly, the food was not the best I've ever had (though it was very good; it is a nice steakhouse after all, can't go wrong) but I would give Club A 10 stars for service if I could.  By far the best I've ever been treated at a restaurant and as far as I could tell, it is because I'm a Yelper.  So read up kids:When we checked in for our reservation, the host asked us if we'd been there before so I mentioned I'd been for a Yelp event (the infamous over-crowded debacle I'm sure some of you remember).  We were seated at the best table in the house, upstairs next to the window with all the pretty Christmas lights outside.  Very romantic.  We asked for the restaurant week menu and started ordering, and midway the owner (or manager, I'm not sure - the extremely nice man with the grey hair) came over and said that because my previous experience was so crowded, we could order the porterhouse for 2 at restaurant week price.  Umm really?  Wow.  (Obviously we took him up on the offer).  And the generosity didn't stop there. They also brought us each a complimentary (huge) lobster ravioli as an appetizer, topped with huge chunks of lobster, a delicious surprise.  The porterhouse was perfectly cooked medium rare and everything we chose from the prixe fixe menu (caesar salad, thick cut bacon, truffle creamed spinach, and mashed potatoes, tiramasu and carrot cake) were all very good (and way too much food).  We had also decided to get an extra side of truffle mac & cheese from the regular menu, and when the check came we were told they took this off our bill.  We started to wonder if they mistook us for Beyonce and Jay-Z.Worth mentioning also is the epic cobra decanter they brought us for our bottle of wine.  They apparently have only one such decanter and it was so cool that neighboring tables were oogling.  They never let our glasses go empty.  And then after we (aka my awesome bf) paid the bill, they offered us complimentary champagne.  I still don't even know what to say.  B gave his highest % ever tip last night; they were so deserving of it.  Even if the food wasn't eyes-roll-back-in-the-head good, after that kind of service I'd go back in a heartbeat.  I don't think they knew it was our anniversary and yet thanks to them we had a very special night.  And that is why I Yelp.",0,0,1,Sherri M.,"Brooklyn, NY",214,384,148

It didn't feel like we were being treated any differently because we had the deal, and moreover it was a LOT of food.The calamari was pretty good for calamari, but in retrospect I probably should have tried something a bit more unique, like the Canadian bacon (which looked amazing) or the steak tartare (equally amazing). The hanger steak was perfection, although my friends thought the filet mignon was a bit tough. The creamed spinach was probably the best I've had (and you could definitely taste the truffle oil), and I thought the tiramisu was great.Overall, the amount of food we got was very very filling. In fact, the combination of foods we got might've been too heavy together, but every dish in itself was great (so advice: if you're going with the Living Social deal, maybe pick one of the courses to be slightly lighter. They certainly have enough choices!). We didn't even break into our second bottle of wine that came with our deal, and the restaurant was nice enough to let us take it home!

3.0,8/25/2011,"I came here after all the wonderful reviews but to be honest the food, service, decor was OK.  Maybe it was because all the high reviews kicked up my expectations but in my opinion I have tasted & experienced better (Old Homestead Steakhouse, Del Friscos for example).  Our party of 4 all ordered from the restaurant week menu so we got to sample a bit of everything...the food was okay but nothing spectacular.  The desserts weren't all that...the pastry shell of the cream puffs I ordered were quite soft/soggy.  The service was attentive but at some point it gets annoying as several different wait staff come to your table to ask if everything is ok instead of your waiter.  We ordered a side of onion rings which were forgotten about & by the time it came we were almost done with our entrees.  The onion rings were thin too whereas I prefer a thick cut to get more of the oniony & batter taste.Update: Since I posted the review the owner of the restaurant contacted me & offered me to come back in to try their porterhouse.  I have made no plans to return to Club A but wanted to note that I appreciate the fact that the owner of the restaurant takes pride in his place & wants to keep his customers happy.",0,0,0,Allie L.,"New York, NY",6,66,161

The hanger steak was cooked perfectly, it was tender and flavorful.  The creamed spinach was so fresh and creamy, I am hungry just thinking about it.  For dessert, we had the tiramisu and the cream puff, it was good but nothing too special about them.At the end of the meal, the waiters brought us a complimentary tartufo to share.  We were full from the meal but couldn't say no to this nice gesture and delicious ball of ice cream!

4.0,8/23/2011,"We got a LivingSocial Deal here for a bottle of wine, two entree, two appetizers and two desserts. Came here on a rainy night and it was packed. We were taken to a secret speakeasy room upstairs and wow it was so cozy and cute. I felt like I was in some manson's entertainment room. We picked the red wine and it was OK but since it is included, you can't really complain :) For appetizer, I picked their mushroom soup and my hubby got the calamari. The soup was AMAZING! It was creamy, mushroomy and just savory. The calamari was a decent portion and the mariana sauce was great for the crispy calamari. For entree, I got the skirt steak with house sauce and my husband chose their filet mignon. Wow I was blown away by their hanger steak and especially their house sauce!! It just made the steak that much better. The filet mignon was not the best I have had but the flavor was definitely the top. We also got a side of mac and cheese and creamy spinach. I think mac and cheese is decent but nothing special. The creamy spinach was great though.We were so full at this point but we managed to finish our desserts, which are cream puffs and tiramisu. The cream puff came in 3 but I could only had 1. It was homemade and was great. TIramisu was creamy and soft. We had a fabulous and romantic fare at Club A. The owner greeted us when we entered and chatted with us when we left. He was such a pleasant owner to be around with.

2.0,8/23/2011,"Although I was excited from all the good reviews, I was sadly disappointed about my experience here.I had the livingsocial deal, like many others, and noted that when making the reservation. When I got there, the reservationist berated me slightly for not having printed out the voucher (I used the code on my phone) - that was slightly annoying, but not really a big deal. He brings us up to the second floor, which my boyfriend and I found quite pretty and intimate (especially with the lights on the trees right outside the window). The service was superb - the waiters were very attentive and polite, and I was very pleased with that aspect. Our appetizers were mixed (bacon - delicious, comparable to Luger's, the calamari - average), but we were really excited for our steaks (filet mignon for me, hanger steak for him). IT came, we cut into it, and I instantly noticed that mine seemed overdone for my taste, and his more rare for his tastes. He had ordered medium steak - me medium rare. Okay, seems like they may have switched up our orders. Annoying, but we'll deal.As we're talking to the staff (a manager?) about the mixup, they happily take my boyfriend's back (since they can just reheat it), but they insisted that my steak was done right. It was not. I am a medium rare steak girl, my boyfriend is a medium guy, and we both knew that the steak was medium, and not what I had asked for. The staff leaves without taking the steak back, and another staff member (the same manager) walks by asking if everything is alright. My boyfriend exclaims that my steak was overdone and that we wanted to send it back. They again examined the steak, said that ""that is medium rare,"" and asked if I wanted it black and blue. I'm pretty sure there is a huge discrepancy between the two. Anyhow, the steak was redone, this time, too rare for my liking (NOT black and blue at least, but definitely more rare than medium rare), but I was too annoyed with the attitude to want to speak with the staff again, as I simply wanted a pleasant evening.Ultimately, I was very disappointed with how they handled the situation. I am sure that they get customers ordering their steak the wrong way, but it felt extremely unprofessional when they insinuated that I did not know what I was talking about, and I would not return because of that. They get 2 stars because the waiters were great, and the other food wasn't bad (I gotta say the spinach was impressive, my boyfriend and I wolfed it down as we waited for our steaks to be returned).",0,0,0,Amy Y.,"Dallas, TX",11,79,0
5.0,8/20/2011,"Very late on this review. I went here on July 6th for the 2nd time and I had a fantastic time. The owner did so much for my girlfriend and me so we can have an awesome time. I asked him to reserve a spot for us where there weren't any people or had very little people. When I show up, I find out that he reserved the whole section for me.  We ordered the crab appetizer and the bacon slice, and he gave us extra shrimp and lobster ravioli on the house. When we got our entree, he offered to buy us wine or champagne. We chose the red wine. After our entree we got free dessert and a HUMONGOUS fruit basket! I was shocked and speechless throughout the whole dinner. And the food was delicious nonetheless.

5.0,8/20/2011,"Went to Club A as part of the Living Social deal.  Had not been before so was excited to try this new restaurant.  The decor is different from a lot of steakhouses in NYC.  Whereas Sparks or Old Homestead might be a place to go with the boys and be loud while eating some big hunks of meat, Club A is more subdued, and more of a place to go on a date or with a few other couples.  Personally, I really liked the decor.As for the service, I would describe it as attentive but not obtrusive.  The wait staff was on top of anything we needed, but I never felt like they were hovering around us.  And when one of the people in our group wanted to make a small substitution (which wasn't allowed with the Living Social deal) they happily allowed it.The food was also very good.  I had the 10oz filet, which was cooked perfectly and was very tasty, and my wife had the salmon, which was a good size and also cooked perfectly.  Someone else at our table had the hangar steak, which came with a delicious sauce/gravy.  I have absolutely no complaints about the food, but if I wanted to nitpick, I could say that the mashed potatoes side dish could have used a little seasoning.Overall, a great meal, a great experience, and I will definitely be coming back.",0,0,0,Henry W.,"Manhattan, NY",0,11,0

The food was great, the steak was a little over salted, but still good. The service was spotty unfortunately. We waited a very long time to put our order in, serveral times (maybe due to the saltiness of the food) I found my water glass empty, and other times when we asked for condiments to be served with the food it was forgotten. We were not sure who our waiter really was, usually a bad/weird thing for a nice steak house. That being said everyone tried their best once we reminded them what we needed.

4.0,8/17/2011,"Came to Club A last night with the Living Social deal that many other Yelpers have already reviewed, so will keep it short. The service was spectacular and I think they changed the bread selection after all the reviews here on Yelp. The olive bread was warm and tasty without being overly salty. Tried the Fried Calamari and Canadian Bacon appetizers, and they were pretty large as far as individual appetizers go. Both were pretty good with simple spices but nothing to rave about. The entrees of Hanger Steak and Filet were clearly the standout of the meal and were cooked to the perfect temperature. They really know how to do a rare steak, which is something not every restaurant in New York does well. The sides I tried were the whipped potatoes and creamed spinach, and both were of great steakhouse quality. The wine (Malbec) was borderline drinkable but came with the deal so that was nice. Desserts weren't my favorite so if I had the option I would skip, to try another one of their sides. Probably the mac and cheese.",1,1,0,George H.,,121,148,29

Great place, ask for the table upstairs by the front window for an extra romantic night. Its also ok to bring well behaved kids. Not the type of establishment you want to bring rowdy kids.

4.0,8/15/2011,"Went here last weekend using the living social deal. Didn't really know what to expect, but it wound up being a great experience!1st thing, the ambiance is absolutely beautiful. It has an old world NY feel . Dark lighting, quiet conversation, a rose and candle on each table and live jazz. It is a perfect date spot. The room upstairs and downstairs both have equally good environments. Service was very attentive and informative. Now, onto the food. We had a limited menu because of the deal - it was similar to a restaurant week menu but with more options. We started with the Canadian bacon and the calamari. The bacon was thick and had a delicious smoked flavor. Came with a sweet cocktail sauce to balance the high salinity. The calamari was standard, but cooked well - not overdone or chewy. For the mains, we obviously had steak. I went with the Fillet Mignon. It was cooked to a perfect medium rare. The flavors were strong, but not overpowering. One of the best Fillet Mignon's Ive ever had. The sides were good but average. Nothing special about them, but we didn't care too much since the steaks were so good. Dessert was also average. Nothing special, but they did the job. Steaks were definitely the highlight of the meal, which was okay with us. Overall, definitely recommend it for a special night. Although, without any of the coupons floating around, it can get quite pricey as the entrees hover around $45-50 each.",0,0,0,Joseph F.,"New York, NY",51,183,5
4.0,8/15/2011,"Elle W. and I took my parents here for dinner on a Saturday night with not one, but two LivingSocial vouchers.   The dinner deal included appetizer, entree, side, dessert, and a bottle of wine for two for $40.  Since we were using the deal, initially I was concerned with the variety of options available from the menu and the service.   I am always happy to be pleasantly surprised, and Club A did just that.  First, there was a variety of options available on the special menu for LivingSocial.  We had six appetizers to choose from including steak tartare and fried calamari.  I got the tartare and it was a generous portion.  I shared it with the table and there was more than enough to go around.  Mushroom was the soup of the day, and it was creamy and flavorful as expected.   Entree options included filet mignon, salmon, roasted chicken, Brook trout, pork chop, and veal. The Filet Mignon was cooked very well and worth coming to Club A to try.  They are after all a steakhouse, and their filet was very delicious, and quite sizable - this was no petite filet.  The only thing is that it looked plain on the dish.  I know that sides are meant to go with the steak, but it just looked so unaccompanied and un-garnished.   The Brook Trout was also very nice -- I really enjoyed the fact that it wasn't overly salty as some steakhouses tend to do with seafood.   It had a nice smattering of chopped asparagus.  The sauce it was in was slightly creamy, which I could have done without, but the taste was very nice.  The Roasted Chicken was surprisingly good.  Chicken is often overlooked at a steakhouse and frequently dry. It was very well done here, the meat was cooked in a way that it locked in the juices.  For sides, we had the option of creamed spinach, mac n cheese, yukon potato puree, and fries.  Creamed spinach was an obvious choice from the sides, and the potato puree was like a fluffier lighter version of mashed potatoes.  My mom really enjoyed the potatoes, and the creamed spinach wasn't too creamy.  We also got the mac and cheese to try, which was decent, but not a repeat order.  For desserts, we had the tiramisu and the carrot cake.  Tiramisu was most appreciated for not being overwhelming on either the expresso or the alcohol.  It probably could have used an extra kick, but it was a nice way to end the meal.  What I appreciated most was the service.  Every person was courteous, kind, and prompt.  At no point did I feel like a second class citizen because of the deal.   Since we only finished one bottle throughout dinner and we had two LivingSocial deals, they even let us take home the unopened second bottle of wine.  That kind of service, in addition to the quality of the food, makes me want to return for another meal or organize a large work dinner here.  Overall we were pleased with the experience.  The only reason I may not return soon is because of the plethora of steakhouses available in the midtown area, and how many more I have yet to try before returning to Club A.",5,3,4,Lu H.,"New York, NY",1218,411,1977
4.0,8/15/2011,"Club A Steakhouse is a 3.5 but I rounded up since it was a pretty good deal. I, along with many others, had the living social deal for a four course steak dinner for two with a bottle a wine. As we walked in, the environment is very dark but very romantic. We were seated in the second level and it was gorgeous. The lighting in the trees, the large window, the candles, and the red roses. My only issue was how close the tables were to each other. We started off with the Malbec wine. When we got our bread basket, I was disappointed. Minus one star for the cold bread and the hard to spread butter. I thought a restaurant of this caliber would at least have fresh hot bread. For appetizers, I got the steak tartare and the bf got the calamari. The tartare was pretty good...nice flavor and textures. But even better was the calamari. What really made it was the sauce; it had a really good kick and spice. For entree, I ordered the filet, med rare and the bf had the veal shank osso buco. YUM, my filet was cooked perfectly and had a flavorful crust. The veal shank was enormous! Very tender but the gravy/sauce on it was pretty gross unfortunately. For sides, we had the creamed spinach and the truffle mac and cheese. I was expecting a better creamed spinach but it fell short. It didn't melt in my mouth at all. But the mac and cheese was divine and had a nice crust on top. Dessert was disappointing as well. The cream puffs were pretty good but not great. The tiramisu had a weird aftertaste..like fruity pebbles.. It was a crowded restaurant so it took impossibly long for us to receive our check (we ordered additional items aside from the dinner). Aside from a few service hiccups, the dinner was quite enjoyable but took about 2.5 hours in total.",1,1,1,Nancy P.,"New York, NY",405,600,236

My man and I came here with a Living Social voucher and our interest was immediately piqued when we saw the jazz trio playing on the lower level. We were ushered upstairs and were lucky enough to have a table right by the front windows. The tree in front of the restaurant is covered in white lights, so the effect on the second level is pretty magical. Every table has a candle and a beautiful dark red rose and the ceiling is upholstered in that same rich rose red. Everything feels intimate and luxurious and so so so romantic.We were given a choice between a bottle of red or white wine and went with red, obviously. Malbec...my favorite! Bread came soon after and our appetizers followed. I went with a classic caesar salad - hard to mess up, but actually particularly good with big, thick shavings of parmesan. He had the steak tartare and, while I politely declined his offer to share (blech!), he reports that it was delicious with the most perfect flavor and texture.We both opted for the hangar steak and chose the creamed spinach and potato puree to accompany the meal. Not only were both our steaks cooked to absolute perfection, but they were served with sides of au poivre sauce! I was ecsatic - I love all kinds of sauces and dips, but that happens to be one of my faves. The steak itself melted in my mouth and I found myself doing the happy food dance every single bite. The potatoes were good, but just okay, and the creamed spinach was subtle and not too heavy.I'd say the weakest link of the meal was the dessert, which is saying something, because it certainly wasn't bad by any means. We had the tiramisu - again, good, but not excellent - and the carrot cake was nice...but not as nice as mine. :) I found it didn't have nearly enough cream cheese frosting for my taste.I wholeheartedly recommend taking someone special to Club A for an absolutely unforgettable meal.",1,0,0,Megan C.,"Astoria, NY",236,265,45

3.0,8/12/2011,"My weekly date night with Jake took a serious upscale turn recently thanks to an amazing deal on LivingSocial.com. Steak and wine are two things we both love--but don't often get enough of on our shoestring budget. I read up on Club A Steakhouse before I purchased the deal, and I'm happy to say yelp.com got it right!The upstairs dining area was intimate and cozy with warm red walls and candlelight. We were whisked to our table and a bottle of Malbec soon followed. I loved the assortment of breads--olive and rosemary, sesame sticks, flat bread and yeast rolls--and had to stop myself from filling up on the fresh-out-of-the-oven doughy goodness.Our menu choices were a lot like those present at NYC Restaurant Week, so I already had my eye on the Steak Tartare. I'm a big fan of tuna tartare, so I figured the dish would be much the same. Boy, was I wrong. It was good, don't get me wrong, I just wish the dish had more acidity and less of a mayonnaise aftertaste. It couldn't have been that bad, however, because Jake lapped up my leftovers. His Fried Calamari was fresh and crisp. Unlike a recent dining experience at Smith & Wollensky, you could tell the calamari wasn't frozen because it was tender and not overly chewy. Filet Mignon was the obvious entree choice, and I must say, Club A Steakhouse has one of the best I've ever tasted. The meat was cooked perfectly with a wonderfully crisp outer layer that gave way to tender, juicy pink filet. The Whipped Yukon Potato Puree brought me back to my childhood. Flavorful and creamy, these mashed potatoes were cooked exactly like my Granny does them. They tested even better with a bite of steak.I read online that the Home Made Cream Puffs were a must have. Eh. They were good I guess, but I'm not partial to fried dough that isn't piping hot.I enjoyed the Tiramisu much more. Each layer was light yet rich and not too boozy. This cocoa and coffee dessert was a perfect way to end a delectable meal.",0,0,0,Victoria P.,"Astoria, NY",25,57,0
5.0,8/11/2011,"We came here for Restaurant Week and were completely blown away by the service, menu options, and an unbelievable meal. I had already been warned (and experienced) not to judge a restaurant by it's Restaurant Week options - both food selection and meal satisfaction. Thus, already having been disappointed, I didn't expect we'd be taking a cab home because I would be too full to walk, nor did I expect to be recapping the entire meal right now. Anyway, allow me to re-live my wonderful meal (:Upon sitting down, I was really impressed with their numerous options for the Restaurant Week menu. Fortunately, there were four of us, enabling us to take advantage of their menu. For the appetizers we had the steak tartare (which was delicious!), classic caesar salad (get something else), and sizzling Canadian Bacon...the bacon was amazing. It was the thickest bacon I'd ever had and so perfectly cooked - I definitely could've made a meal out of that! We all had the filet mignon (no experimentation there) and it was very good. It was charred a bit on the outside, but was perfect on the inside. For sides, we got the creamed spinach and the potatoes - both perfect! The dessert was nothing to scream about (but I'm not a huge fan of cream puffs, which everyone else thought were pretty good).Regardless of the amazing food, our experience wouldn't have been what it was had it not been for their amazing service.

When the beers were brought to the table they were not poured for us. Different waiters keep coming by, none was dedicated. The food was average at best. The lamb chop portion was way too small (came with mint jelly, very lame, hoping they don't think they are dinner). The lamb wasn't evenly cooked they are clear thick shock lines.  The Osso Bucco sauce was tasty but not rich enough or deep enough to penetrate the meat. The steak was average.

Their steaks are perfectly aged, and cooked exactly the way you want it every time. There is absolutely no need for steak sauce because it is seasoned to perfection. I will say that the steaks look a bit charred but you can't judge a book by its cover and apparently the same goes for the Club A steaks. I've tried three different types of steaks while I was there, the Porterhouse, the Filet Mignon, and the New York Steak. Honestly I can't decide which is my favorite because they are all so good. The meat is juicy, moist, just sheer perfection. The wines that they offer pare perfectly with the steaks, the ambiance is wonderful, a nice dim setting that just screams class. A side of the creamed spinach is rich and absolutely delicious. A helpful and courteous staff just tops it off.

He told me that he wanted to open a steakhouse that you could bring a date for a nice meal. He has succeeded!!! The decor is a rich red with dim lighting and pictures of regular diners on the wall. There was a jazz band playing great music and me and my girlfriend sang along all night. By the way , the band was the perfect volume (not too loud where you had to yell to be heard). Bruno actually cares about your opinion and is thankful to have your business. How many steakhouses make you feel like that? The food is just as good as any other steakhouse in NYC ! The Canadian bacon was awesome! The porterhouse was perfect! The deserts are better than any other place in the city! Get the Saybion sauce over fresh berries. The chef makes it right in front of you and pours it nice and warm over the fresh berries. It was unbelievable. It really was a refreshing break to have a great meal in a steakhouse and not feel like I am getting mugged when the waiter hands me the check. Guys....if you want to impress a date with a great meal , this is it. I have officially moved Club A Steakhouse into my regular rotation and I will be back very shortly. What a great night we had.

3.0,8/6/2011,"Club ""C"" Steakhouse was just that, a C in my book.  When I think of a single adjective to describe Club A Steakhouse it would be ""prosaic.""  Nothing about the place is special.  From the food to the pictures of the owner and random people on the wall, its nothing I haven't seen or tasted before.After being seated 45 minutes after our reservation, Club A had already started the evening on the wrong note.  It had several opportunities to make up for the lack of punctuality but failed on every occasion.  Upon our seating, we didn't even submit our food orders for another 45 minutes.  The restaurant was severely understaffed.  Our server was very apathetic and carelessly brought the wrong bottle of wine to our table.  If I did not catch it, the extra $200 definitely would have been a surprise.While the service was detestable, the food was satisfactory and even plentiful at times.  You see, they tried to make up for the long wait by giving us copious amounts of 'free' appetizers.  By the time our entrees arrived we were already full with all of the rich (and heavy) extras we had received as compensation.  Their wine decanters were about the only bright spot of the evening, they were unique and frightfully delicate.There are a million places in the city like Club A Steakhouse, I suggest you try them before coming here.",2,1,0,Adam K.,"New York, NY",61,106,0

5.0,8/4/2011,"Club A definitely gets an ""A"" in my book! Booked it through open table on a Sat night. First off, it is a $$$ dollar steak house in Midtown Manhattan. Is this place for real? It should be like $$$$$ dollars! Back to the place though. Had a res for 4 peeps. The gf and I arrived and waited at the bar for 45 minutes for our friends. The hostess never complained or came up asking if the rest of our party is here. The bartender was really funny. She made me a Bombay S. gibson martini (Bombay S gin, vermouth, pickled onions). I always am sure to ask if the onions are really old. She said they were a little old, but they were fine. Usually the bartender will just say that they are fine and that is that. I appreciated her honesty. Friends finally arrived and we were seated. Ordered a 16 oz fillet ($42 dollars) cant beat that! It was cooked to perfection and delicious. My buddy had a 24 oz rib eye (around $40 dollars). Gf's split a fillet because they are so damn big (the fillets, not the gf's....Yikes). All the meats were cooked perfectly. Sides were mac and cheese, creamed spinach, and mashed potatoes. My fav was the creamed spinach. It was actually made fresh and not some crap that came out of can. It was great. Then they offered us a comp fruit plate for dessert. It was a nice touch to the end of the meal. Best part was total bill for steaks, sides, and a bottle of wine was $290 bucks for 4 people. Cant beat that price. Club A you are the steakhouse king of Manhattan!",1,3,0,Steve S.,"Chicago, IL",92,179,8

5.0,7/31/2011,"Club A... where do I begin?  It's my favorite steakhouse in the city.  Better than Luger's, by a mile and a half.  It's kinda become a little tradition of my boyfriend and me, to go here.  The ambiance is classy, beautiful, and intimate.  The red walls (I usually hate the color red, but trust me, its beautiful), cozy booths, lighted trees outside, and rose on your table are as romantic as it gets!  The location in manhattan is perfectly upscale, while being slightly off the beaten path.  The service has always been good, if somewhat inconsistent.  It's classy, but not overly stuffy or formal.  It's a little upscale but laid back, which we like.We've found that it's actually a better value to order off the regular menu with the wider range (and bigger portions) of sides, as opposed to the pre fix menu (which is the same for groupon, couples night, and restaurant week).  The desert the pre fix comes with doesn't make it worthwhile.  Oh yea, the one thing this place is lacking is decent desserts- don't even bother with those.  But don't let that deter you! The steak.  I'm drooling just thinking about it.  I've had the fillet and the ribeye, both are superb.  I like the ribeye better as a cut, just because it has more flavor (and more fat).  The ribeye is big enough to split; with the fillets, we each got one.  The sides.  We've found that they give a bigger portion when you order just one side, so we generally get asparagus with hollandaise.  It is soooo good.  Speaking of hollandaise, oh god, the sauces.  THE SAUCES.  I could come here just for the sauces.  With the steak I got bernaise (favorite) and bourdeliase (good).  The wine.  I've had the Francis Ford Coppola Cabernet Sauvignon which was excellent.For 2 people, we usually spend about $120 including tax and tip, which is well worth it.  Thanks Club A!!  We'll be back, that's for sure.",1,0,0,Ava S.,"Brooklyn, NY",57,41,10
3.0,7/31/2011,"When I first heard the name ""Club A Steakhouse""  I thought it literally meant clubbing a steak with a Flintstones size club and dragging the carcass to the cook who'd prep it for me. Stone age fantasies aside, the ""A"" in Club A refers to the three sons of the owner: Arben, Agron and Alban. Hence Club A.I was in da club last night, making the most of a non-yelp social media coupon deal site's offer of $80 for $160 worth of food and , most importantly, drink.Firstly, hats off to the staff for showing tremendous patience with our party, half of which suffered through a traffic delay of Biblical proportions.The staff was friendly but did commit one faux pas when presenting side dishes, mainly scooping out a small portion for me and my wife but failing to serve my friends in a similar manner. A minor quibble but duly noted.I started with the sizzling canadian bacon, extra thick. And I tell you, I could have had five slices of this glorious pig part, complete with succulent fat. If this is the bacon of Canada, I must expatriate.Up next was the main of 10oz filet mignon with a side of mac and cheese. A sizable chunk of filet, my first impression bite was one of satisfaction. However, as I continued to nibble I realized that this wasn't particularly tender or that flavorful. I almost was tempted to ask for steak sauce...almost.But the side of mac and cheese returned a smile to my dining game face as this was creamy, cheesy and really easy to desire a larger portion.The final course was a dessert  of cream puffs, three to be exact. I did navigate my fork around the plate so as to remove any remaining bit so these were good.So canadian bacon and mac 'n cheese take top honors. I'd go back for those two plates alone. The filet mignon, well, I've had better but a noble effort. Three stars it is.",2,3,5,Tom K.,"Forest Hills, NY",337,820,47

3.0,7/29/2011,"I was expecting so much considering the amazing reviews on Yelp, but alas, I was slightly disappointed.  :(The service was great once we were seated, but I wasn't happy with the hostess, as I felt like she gave us a bit of an attitude.  First of all, she ignored us for 2 minutes while we stood in front of her. That's not usually a long time, but at a restaurant, standing in front of someone as they looked down at a paper in front of them, it's a long time.  We arrived at 6PM and even though I had made the reservation the night before, she couldn't find it.  She kept reading off names that obviously weren't mine at different times ranging from 6PM-8PM, meanwhile the whole restaurant was empty!  Finally, the manager came over and she told them she couldn't find our reservation, he promptly seated us at one of the many empty tables.  Once we were seated, the bread basket was brought out quickly and drink orders taken.  They were very good at keeping our waters filled and continuously asked us if the meal was OK.  My bf and I both got the filet mignon and although good, not great.  He got his med rare and I got mine medium, both a little on the dry side, and the outside was a bit burnt.  I've had better steak at chain restaurants....The sides were really good though.  Like other reviewers mentioned, the spinach was creamy and the potato puree was whipped and smooth. I can't say the same for the desserts, I got the carrot cake and my bf got the creme puffs.  We usually devour our desserts, but these both left us wanting more.  The carrot cake tasted like they had recently defrosted it- the cake was cold and the frosting pretty stiff.  To quote my bf- ""these taste like Costco creme puffs""I'm really sad to say that I had high hopes and was disappointed.  Not bad, but not great.",0,0,0,Eve C.,"Oceanside, NY",97,81,13
4.0,7/29/2011,"Just visited for the 2011 Summer RW. Me and my bf both went for the RW menu.Appetizer:Fried Calamari: Solid, but nothing special.Soup of the Day (broccoli soup): this was excellent! it was creamy but not too heavy, and quite flavorful.Entree:Salmon: it was cooked to perfection. The sauce that it came with was especially delicious.Filet Mignon: I ordered it medium and it was cooked just about right. It kind of lacked flavor though. It was definitely good, but I wouldn't say it was the best filet mignon I had. Sides:Creamed Spinach: might be the best thing we had at this place, quite surprisingly. I never thought spinach could be so delicious!Potato Puree: pretty good mashed potatoes, but nothing more than that.Dessert:Tiramisu: this was the only disappointing part of the meal. Certainly passable.Cream puffs: really light and fluffy! I wish it was a little sweeter, but my bf thought it had just right amount of sweetness. Nonetheless, it was definitely a pleasant ending to the meal.Overall, it was definitely a very satisfying meal for both of us. The service was quite good as well.

3.0,7/29/2011,"After my friend gave this hidden place a glowing review, i just had to try it.  It was this or DB Kitchen.  Decided to go for this place first, and then try Kitchen at a later date...Place was easy to find, good location.  My reservation was set for 8:30p.  I managed to slip away from work earlier so i wanted to go in at 8p.  The hostess wasn't very accomodating at all over the phone and said that we'd ""maybe"" get seated earlier.  Decided that the uncertainty wasn't worth it so we went around 8:30.  Food:Steak Tartare -Great!  served with Meslun salad on the side.  Perhaps could have used a bit more greens, but then again, we were at a steakhouse.Sizzling Canadian Bacon-Extra Thick by the Slice -Not a big fan of bacon, but this was so good...

3.0,7/26/2011,"My bf and I came during Restaurant Week to celebrate our anniversary.  The restaurant has a nice ambiance overall; perfect for a romantic dinner. They had a live pianist at the sitting area on the first floor. Most of the rooms are draped in red cloth.   The reason why I gave it a 3 is because the waiters generally ignored our table to cater other tables. We had to ask for lemons 3 times. I would like to make that clear that that was the only thing we requested. No complaints prior or bad attitude to the waiters what-so-ever. We received our appetizers at an average time for salads. Our entrees on the other hand, took about 20-25 minutes to arrive. My bf ordered the hangar steak which came with delectable sauce while my Filet Mignon was a bit over-charred on the top layer. Thus, it was a bit hard to cut/chew.  When we finished our meals, it took the waiters 15 minutes to come collect our plate AFTER the OWNER/MANAGER started collecting our plates as he realized nobody has come to tend our table. That is when the bus boy hastily came.   We were just about ready to leave from the slow service. We asked for the desserts and our check.  Our check came. And the dessert did not... UNTIL we informed the waiter that we did not receive our desserts.   *As an apology for the forgotten desserts, they gave us two glasses of complimentary champagne.  Do not get me wrong, this would be a great place to dine. Yet, based on our experience, I am a bit saddened that we did not receive the 5 star experience as listed by fellow yelpers.",2,0,0,Becky Q.,"San Francisco, CA",582,213,197
5.0,7/25/2011,"First of all, I have to apologize for this monstrosity of a review. But seriously, I don't think it would be complete if I didn't tell the WHOLE story. To begin, my boyfriend loves steak so for his birthday, I picked Club A as the dinner venue for a little celebration with a couple of friends (I made the choice based on the rave reviews from my fellow Yelpers). I made a reservation about a month in advance and included a little note that this occasion was for a birthday celebration and that anything they could do to make it extra special would be very much appreciated. Little did I know how seriously they take us customers! Before I begin my review, let me just say, we spent THREE hours at this restaurant for dinner, and the time just FLEW by.Fast forward a month... the boyfriend and I arrived 15 minutes before our 8 p.m. reservation. Once our friends arrived, I let the host know that we were all here. Unfortunately our table wasn't ready yet (it was just past 8 p.m. at this point), but OK, I can wait 10 minutes, no problem. Once we were seated, we were handed a wine list. We were so engrossed in picking out a wine the first 20 minutes that we didn't notice we hadn't gotten actual food menus until AFTER we had ordered wine. (NOTE: We had gone on a double date with this same couple to Nino's in the UES for Valentine's Day a few months earlier--using a TravelZoo voucher--which was a complete disaster. Nino's had ""messed up"" our reservation so we basically didn't have one, AND they had run out of lobster but failed to tell us until we were ordering it. Needless to say, I was deathly afraid that this night at Club A was going to turn into a repeat.) Our friend, god love him, waved over a gentleman and said bluntly, ""Uh, can we get some menus and some service, please??"" The poor man kind of started and then said, ""You haven't gotten menus?!"" He then proceeded to start scolding some guy and when he was finished, he came over and apologized profusely and said, ""I will make it up to you.""So let the feasting begin! First, I was under the impression that Club A did not do Restaurant Week on the weekends; it was even written in my OpenTable reservation that they DO NOT do RW prix fixe on the weekends. OK fine. But wait... when we GOT to Club A, the manager said they ARE doing RW. Wait, what? Uhm... ok, I'll take it and run with it. So three of us did the RW prix fixe (each of us got a choice of appetizer, entree, one side, and a dessert), and my boyfriend gets the special T-bone (24 oz.). He asks the manager what he would recommend for a side, and you know what he says??? ""Oh don't worry about the sides, I'll take care of you."" Hmmmm... curious, but again, OK, we'll take it. So we've ordered and are sipping on our wine and munching on the bread in the regular bread basket when the manager comes out with garlic bread and Canandian bacon, both dishes on the house. We all literally said, wow.... not one, but TWO free dishes! That's great! And they both tasted very nice. After gobbling down our appetizers (I just got a regular house salad), it was time for the main event. Our entrees came out, flanked by... you got it, two more side dishes on the house--a nice and tender asparagus and the truffle mac 'n cheese, both of which were AWESOME. Highly recommend the mac 'n cheese. I had gotten the 10 oz. filet mignon, medium rare. I'm not a big steak person, so I probably didn't enjoy it as much as a steak connoisseur would. But I still enjoyed it. My boyfriend's T-bone was humongous, and I'll give it to him, he's not a big guy, but I knew he would finish the entire thing.  The Yukon potato puree and cream of spinach were also delish. For my boyfriend's dinner, I had brought a homemade cake, which I asked them to keep in the fridge for us while we had dinner. After clearing our main courses, they brought out the cake with a candle on it and started singing ""happy birthday"". Bruno, the owner, even came by and personally wished my boyfriend a happy birthday. He asked him how old he was turning, to which my boyfriend replied, ""28."" Bruno responded, ""28??? I'm 39."" My boyfriend laughed and gave him a high-five. Bruno then proceeded to give us a round of champagne, on the house. Needless to say, we all had huge smiles on our faces.After we were done with the homemade cake, our friends at Club A brought out our prix fixe desserts and even handed my boyfriend a tiramisu, ON THE HOUSE AGAIN (he didn't order from the prix fixe menu and didn't order a separate dessert). All we could do was thank them and sit there in awe... with huge smiles on our faces yet again. And not only was the tiramisu on the house, it was pretty good, light and perfectly balanced.To sum it up, after a slight delay in getting seated and another slight delay in getting our menus, Club A more than made it up to us. I can't thank you enough for making my boyfriend's birthday such a success! You can bet we'll be back for our next special occasion!",1,1,1,Carolyne S.,"San Jose, CA",78,28,25
4.0,7/23/2011,"Delicious, lovely, friendly, comfortable. I'd give it a 4.75 if I could.  I came in very early (5:15) for dinner for two. While chatting with the (charming) owner and and the (lovely, smart) bartender I learned that the restaurant was Italian for thirty years and was reinvented as a steakhouse: It shows in the generous hospitality. We were using a Living Social thing and while there was a little confusion about whether we could use it during Restaurant Week, they were super gracious about it. We had: A terrific Argentine Malbec. It could've been slightly colder but it was decanted and cooled off in the room, and was delicious. A great bread basket. A phenomenal Ceasar, which the kitchen split onto two plates without being asked, and good, toothsome but not chewy, crispy calamari. Then, compliments of the chef, an oversized lobster ravioli in cream sauce with asparagus. Oddly plated, meaty, evocative of the sea and a really nice surprise. Also, delicious. The entrees were a remarkably great filet mignon, perfectly cooked and served with a truffled creamed spinach that I would marry if New York would just, y'know, lighten up, and the brook trout with almonds, asparagus and buerre blanc. I love tasting the wine in buerre blanc and this was great. The trout was very nicely cooked and a nice sized filet. The side, whipped Yukon potatoes, I didn't love like the spinach. I ate them, don't get me wrong, but I like texture and these were so smooth and slightly watery that I imagined a little box of Idaho Spuds.  For dessert we had the cream puffs which were phenomenal: little super fresh, light zeppole with a delicate (giandua?) cream, and tiramisu which, befitting a former successful Italian restaurant, was f'ing awesome. I love this place. I want to come back and try the whole menu. The service is great-- lots of servers and runners, all gracious and unobtrusive. We were seated in a great cushy round booth in the upstairs dining room despite being only two. There's a pretty tree right out the window, crazy chandeliers, and everything was a pleasing red and black color scheme. The music is a problem-- alternating volumes, songs (New York, New York,) repeating, but I bet they're working on it-- it doesn't seem like something they'd overlook for long. It's great for parties and celebrations and intimate dinners-- the overall sound was well modulated by all the insulating cushiness, and I'd be happy to bring the foodiest friends.",0,0,1,M.M.

5.0,7/13/2011,"I'm giving this place 5 stars BUT with 1 very slight disappointment... I always read reviews on yelp before eating out at places... its become quite the habit. Upon reading the other reviews for the Yelp deal, i saw that people got free lobster ravioli or free coffee or a fruit plate... sigh... but for us... nothing. OK... before you roll your eyes at me... i know i can't complain because i didn't get anything free... BUT don't you think there should be some level of consistancy? I guess i get stuck on the principle of things, if youre going to do something for a majority of your customers it should be consistent throughout all... thats all i'm saying. That aside... this place is beautiful and spacious. We got to sit at the second floor and wow, i was surprised at how beautiful and warm those lights in the tree made me feel. The service... my goodness the service is AMAZING. We were seated at a two topper but they immediately moved us to a more spacious couch once it became available. Very nice.  I think we were one of the last tables of the night and we were not rushed at all! They left us take our time and finish our whole bottle of wine. Although towards the end it was really hard to do with stuffed bellies. I knew to order my steak medium as it would come out more like medium rare in the center. Usually I need some sort of sauce to dip it in but i did not need it at all. It was seasoned so well i just ate it as served. I forgot to mention the appetizers 1. mac and cheese 2. creamed spinach. I got an overwhelming flavor of truffle oil from both of these dishes... or there was truffle oil in one and it seeped into the other? Either way... i wasn't complaining, i love truffle flavored anything... We had so much food leftover that we had a nice little brunch the next morning.

After not one, not two... but THREE overcooked steaks at some of Miami's best restaurants during a recent vacation, I was losing hope. Preparing myself for a beefless future of anemia. Alas, Club A to the rescue! My steak was mooing and bloody red all the way to the ends, and I savored every bite. Definitely some of the best beef I've ever had, and I'm grateful NYC's Summer 2011 Restaurant Week gave me an affordable opportunity to eat like a queen at one of the city's best steakhouses. Go, before it's too late!The ambiance is classy and elegant, as you'd expect, but with a modern flair and splash of color that makes it particularly memorable. Unfortunately, I was too pumped up with antihistamines (damn you, vicious NY mosquitoes!) to indulge in the wine specials, but I highly recommend ordering a bottle just to see the beautiful way it is presented and served. Service is attentive - you will never, ever have a glass that's half full (or half empty, to you hardened, embittered New Yorkahs out there). One server was particularly awesome, and I wish I knew his name..... he brought my girlfriends and I complimentary champagne that perfectly capped off our wonderful evening, and he always had a smile on his face. I definitely consider myself a member of this ""Club""!",7,5,3,Erin D.,"New York, NY",935,342,58
4.0,7/13/2011,"when i dine out, i expect good food and attentive service.  i don't think that's too much to ask considering i am paying for both.  club a has now landed on my list of go-to places when i'm looking for a superb dining experience.from the moment we walked into club a, my boyfriend and i felt welcomed into the restaurant.  it was about 15 feet from the entrance to the host/ess area.  when i explained that i had reservations under my name, the host (possibly owner?  manager?) knew exactly who i was.  not that we had met before, but he clearly knew the names of the people who were expected that night.  that acknowledgment was a first from all the fine dining places that i've been to.  it was nice.  there is a bar and a dining area on the first floor.  we were taken up to the 2nd floor where i noticed ceiling to floor windows looking out to lots of shimmer!  on the side of the restaurant that we were seated, the windows looked out to white christmas lights strung onto the branches of a tree.  between the dark interior (lit by candlesticks on each table and red chandeliers hanging here and there), it was really an enchanted experience.  the ceiling was also covered in red silky and pillowy like designs that made the room feel very lush.clearly, i was impressed by the decor.  the food and dinner service did not disappoint either.  my medium 10oz filet was so tender (to the point of coming apart if i gave it a little tug with my fork) with a little crust on the outside and my cream puffs were just so decadent.  i couldn't help but swirl my vanilla filled cream puffs around the chocolate cream that each puff was presented in.  it was almost unbelievable, but everytime my glass of water was even 10% less filled to the brim, someone came by to re-fill it.  the service was timed so well that i even got to enjoy the varied assortment of breads that came at the beginning of the meal.  it reminded me of how much i love carbs with steakhouse cold and hard butter.  we definitely ate more than half of the break basket.  i left describing the appetizer last because it was good, but what's there to say about fried calamari that is prepared well?  i was impressed with the little net that was wrapped around the lemon so that i didn't have to pick out the seeds after dressing the fried calamari with lemon.  the dipping sauce was also a little spicy.after a 90 minute dining experience, the only time i felt a little rushed was with paying.  and if you haven't already figured out, club a is pricey.  nevertheless, i will return again for another special dining experience.",0,0,1,Foodie C.,"New York, NY",5,232,32
5.0,7/10/2011,"This Steakhouse is hands down one of the finest dining establishments I've been to in a long time.Club A makes for a perfect romantic date or a celebratory special occasion for couples, families, friends, anyone! The ambiance was perfect, dark enough to be romantic but not so that you can barely see your food. Candlelit is always a plus!The service was outstanding. Waiters were very, very observant and tended to all of our needs. They wouldn't even let me pour my own glass of wine! Once they saw me about to refill my glass, a waiter quickly came to pour it for me haha.The food was phenomenal. I mean, my filet mignon was cooked to perfection. Tender and juicy. I believe I had the macaroni and mashed potatoes for sides. Even something as simple as that tasted out of this world.As a tip, as fancy as this steakhouse is, you don't have to have a fat wallet to enjoy the delicacies of Club A. If you are a couple, make sure to ask about the couples night out menu. For $100, you get 4 courses each. I believe you start with a salad, entree, side, and then desert EACH. AND you get a WHOLE bottle of wine!! Now if that's not bang for your buck then I don't know what is my friend!Please do yourself a favor and try out Club A!

5.0,7/7/2011,"As a promise to the staff and the owner, Bruno, I have created my Yelp account, and proceeded to pen a review for Club A Steakhouse.  This isn't a review entirely about the food.  Rather, I give Club A Steakhouse 5 stars based on the totality of a streamlined experience, a friendly staff, a comfortable atmosphere, and a reasonable pricetag.To begin, it was my distinct pleasure to organize a surprise dinner for my buddy's 30th birthday.  After a lengthy consideration I decided to contact Club A Steakhouse.  I don't like making phone calls, so I opted to email Jaime.  The entire reservation process was handled via email - it was informative, concise, flexible, and prompt.I arrived 30 minutes before my reservation, and was greeted by none other than Bruno.  He offered me two private dining rooms to choose.  The one on the 2nd floor was larger and fancier looking.  However, I chose the ""secret"" room on the 3rd floor, because I liked the square dining table, the balcony (for smokers in my group), the iPod docking station (BYOMusic), and the flat screen TV. The members of the staff presented to be knowledgeable, professional, and affable.  We'd crack jokes back and forth throughout the night.  They offered to aerate and chill our wine, store our cake, and play along with our plan to surprise the birthday boy.  Bruno would check into the room and make sure everything was okay from time to time.The food was delicious. We ordered our dinner a la carte and ended up with the usual steakhouse appetizers, entrees, and sides.  I had the opportunity to scavenge from people around me and noted some of my favorites: Canadian bacon, mushroom soup, filet mignon, NY strip, creamed spinach, and lobster ravioli.  Mind you, this isn't to say everything else wasn't as enjoyable - I am looking forward to conquering the rest of the menu next time I go to Club A Steakhouse.To say that I've had one of the most delicious meals in Club A Steakhouse is a mere understatement - because a good meal is what I had expected prior to arranging this dinner.  What I did not predict was that I felt as if I'd been dining at Club A Steakhouse for years.  Moreover, Club A Steakhouse went above and beyond to hook us up with complimentary dishes (yes, more than one type).  It's dilemmatic for me to comment on this because I don't intend to encourage people to expect freebies - however I would just like to emphasize the excellence of the entire dining experience beyond my expectation.  Thank you, Bruno, from the bottom of my heart, for making me feel like I was having the best Kobe burger at home.

5.0,7/5/2011,"hands down the BEST service i have ever received at a nyc restaurant EVER (including daniel, le bernardin, picholine, etc.)  if you are planning a dinner for a large group, do not think twice and do not even hesitate in calling club a to set up a reservation!i came here with a group of 14 for a friend's 30th birthday. they offered us a private dining option (cozy room upstairs with a private balcony) and did not force us into a prix fixe option (as do many restaurants that attempt to cater to large groups). the serving staff was polite, friendly, and *gasp* FUNNY! it was a surprise 30th birthday and they were great about playing along with all our little requests. they were super patient and did not let on any signs of exasperation even though the guest of honor showed up an hour late! on top of that, they let us bring our own music (ipod/iphone player), bring our own wine ($25 corkage fee), bring our own cake ($2.25 cutting fee to which they even added their own flair by decorating with chocolate syrup) and did not pressure us to order off their own dessert of wne menus (which we eventually did anyway because we were having such a great time). as if that weren't enough, they threw in SO many freebies including a lobster ravioli appetizer plate for every person, free sides (mashed potatoes, mac&cheese, mushrooms), free glasses of champagne for everyone, and profiteroles. the owner and manager both looked in on us continuously throughout the night to ensure we were having a good time and to make sure we had everything we needed.  their standard sauvignon blanc was crisp and fruity without being overly sweet and was a nice aperitif. the balcony area was beaut fully decorated with Christmas lights in the trees and the cool summer breeze made the night nearly perfect. the portions were enormous and the food was delicious. i would personally recommend the canadian bacon or oyster appetizers followed by either the filet mignon or veal chops. the meat was tender and cooked to perfection! they had a variety of sauces but the club steak sauce was by far the best. the only thing lacking in this entire dining experience (and this is not an understatement by any means) was the quality of the side dishes. the mac&cheese, mashed potatoes, sauteed spinach, were all very standard and nothing amazing. but that being said, their steaks were cooked so deliciously that i didn't even really find myself reaching for any sides. in addition, there is a flat screen tv in the dining room so that no one has to miss a pivotal moment on espn. our group didn't care for it, but i'm sure this could be great for another party.",4,3,3,Diane P.,"New York, NY",145,109,121

4.0,6/24/2011,"The prevailing notion is that ""steakhouse = stuffy and ostentatious."" But I must say that Club A dispels that notion while still retaining measures of class and welcomeness.The only reason I'm not giving them five stars is because I'm a hater!But a few more visits may force me to concede that last star...My love and I went to Club A for dinner, prior to watching a performance of the New York City Ballet.  Now I normally don't report on service and hospitality- not because they aren't important but because it is much too easy to let a staff's sour attitude improperly sour the perception of your food. I try to stay focused on the dishes themselves and report on the staff is they've been grotesquely rude.  However, our waiter [though initially stiff and stilted] was accommodating and made for a pleasant time. As he loosened up over the course of the evening, so did we and it really made for an enjoyable time. Furthermore, the manager visited our table at least twice to ensure our satisfaction, and he was not pushy or curt in his approach.I must also say that, while the service did not skew my view of our food, my lady and I were in agreement that the dishes were well presented and cooked to order. Her filet mignon was succulent and not overcooked or dry, and my salmon entree was sublime in how it melted on my tongue. Neither was oversalted to hide a lack of flavor (as is the case in many lower establishments), and our sides of creamed spinach and mac & cheese were robust in taste and more than we could finish (which is impressive when you consider the price).Club A is a gem and stands in contrast to Delmonico's or Ben & Jack's- not in a bad way but as an alternative to a younger elite that still has an appreciation for fine cuisine and service.",0,0,1,Alex Z.,"Jamaica, NY",43,9,0

5.0,6/24/2011,"WOW!  What a delightful and amazing experience! We haven't been treated this well since Spain, so it was a nice delight to be welcomed here at Club A Steakhouse.I'm so glad I purchased the four course dinner for two Yelp Deals (back in January).  It was a great introduction to Club A Steakhouse and Bruno, the very friendly and accommodating owner.We arrived 15 minutes early, expecting to wait at the bar but Bruno greeted us and took us upstairs to our table.  We were seated at the private, quiet setting at the semi-circle table by the window upstairs.  It was perfect and just what I wanted since we were celebrating for my husband's birthday.  To start off, we had the steak tartare and the bacon as our appetizers.  The steak tartare was done just right, and the bacon was super big enough to feed 2-3 people!  Before we got our entree, we were offered a complimentary lobster ravioli, which was absolutely delicious!  I guess you can't assume that steakhouses don't have good seafood!  The lobster was really fresh and cooked to perfection with the delicate cream sauce.  We then had our entrees; I had the filet mignon, medium rare, cooked just right, and my husband had the skirt steak, just as tasty.  We knew dessert was coming, but what we didn't know was that they surprised my husband with a huge platter of dessert (more than what was included in the menu) and inscribed Happy Birthday!  My husband thought I had secretly requested for it (I couldn't lie so I didn't take the credit), but what really happened was that Bruno and his staff carefully read my online reservation notes :-) How thoughtful!! In summary, the service, food, and ambiance was excellent, which is why I give five stars to Club A Steakhouse!  I highly recommend this place for special occasions because they will make you feel even more special!",4,0,0,Caroline C.,"Brooklyn, NY",381,311,298

5.0,6/20/2011,"We bought a Yelp deal back in January and have been dying to use it. Finally my schedule opened up a bit so that we finally could. $80 for a 4 course meal & bottle of wine was a real steal! We arrived 30 minutes early for our reservation and were seated within a few minutes. The owner, Bruno, brought us to our table. The decor was red, the lights were dim, and there were black and white photos of people, who I assume are Bruno's family and friends, making it romantic but with a feel of home and coziness. We ordered the Malbec for our bottle and the waitress poured it for us to taste, which I was excited about because I've never done that before. My bf said they usually only pour it for the man, so I was happy that I got to try it as well because I am the type of girl who would be ticked off by that. Then she poured it in a decanter. All of the different tables had a different designed glass decanter, a rose, and a wax candle. Our glasses were never empty and we never had to call anyone over for anything once. I felt like our meal flew by, the service was so speedy.The food: For our appetizers I got the Fried Calamari and my bf got the Caesar Salad. We always try each others food. We loved them both. Then we were surprised with Lobster Ravioli...compliments of the house! :) This made my day. We were joking that the walls must be bugged because I had literally just been talking about going out for lobster soon. It was amazing!! I def. want to check out the rest of the menu! Then, for our entrees we both got the 10 oz. Filet Mignon. I get rare, he gets medium rare. It was sooo tender and melted in my mouth! I honestly don't think I've ever had filet mignon that tasted like that before. It was amazing!! I liked my bf's too but I prefer rare... We were super nervous about the sides. The options were Garlic Herb Fries, Whipped Yukon Potato Puree, Mac & Cheese, and Truffle Oil Spinach. We got the Potato Puree but because I didn't want anymore carbs we went with the Truffle Oil Spinach. Why we were nervous: We watch MasterChef haha so we learned that Truffle Oil is a chef's worst nightmare and is a pretty big no no. I kind of agree with MasterChef on that one. The Spinach was my least fav. of the whole meal but I was so excited/scared for the Truffle Oil experience in itself. It wasn't as bad as I expected but I def. see what they mean about it. For dessert I had the Tiramisu and my bf got the Cream puffs. Again, both were excellent. I am so glad we took advantage of this Yelp deal because otherwise I would have never been able to come here. My bf's eyes were actually  glazed over and partially closed for most of the meal haha. I also appreciated Bruno taking the time to meet and greet us even though we were young kids with a coupon. It really meant a lot to me. I will definitely come back if I have the opportunity to do so. Thanks for the Lobster Ravioli!",1,1,1,Chelsea B.,"Secaucus, NJ",329,335,187

We were originally trying to go to Keen's, but they were booked when I tried to make the reservation a while ago. So I searched on Yelp for another place and came across Club A Steakhouse which looked great!From the moment we entered Club A, we were treated like gold! As soon as we were settled at our table, the owner Bruno (a lovely man) came over and asked how we were doing. I had told him we were celebrating our parents anniversary, and it turned out that both he and his wife were celebrating the same anniversary year. They started us off with a complimentary appetizer of the sizzling bacon with the homemade steak sauce. This was delicious!Then we moved on to dinner which was also fantastic. My mom and I shared the Porterhouse for two. My brother got the T-bone which was the special of the night. My dad got the NY Strip Steak. For side dishes we got creamed spinach, 5-cheese truffle mac 'n cheese, hash browns, and a baked potato. The steaks were all amazingly tender and had such a great taste to them, and this is coming from someone who likes but does not love steak. After dinner, we were treated to complimentary dessert. They had given us a dessert platter filled with the tiramisu, creampuffs, and carrot cake. They also put ""happy anniversary"" on the plate for my parents. It was a lovely touch to the night. Dessert was also fantastic. The cream puff was my favorite (I think, but they were all really good). Bruno came over one last time, where we couldn't thank both him and his waitstaff enough for everything they had given us. He offered to buy us a round of after dinner drinks as well, but we were honestly too full at that point.Club A is an exceptional place! The restaurant was exactly what we were looking for with ambiance. It was beautifully lit and low-key. We could actually sit and have a conversation and actually hear each other.

I took the waiters suggestion and ordered the slab of Canadian bacon served with the house made steak sauce. What an experience!. I normally dislike Canadian bacon but this was in another league!. So smokey mello and full of pork goodness. I found out the owner gets it from his meat provider. The house salad and light as air fried calamari were great too. For entrees I thought I would change it up since I had steak last time. I had the sole almondine. Pan fried with browned butter, almonds and baby asparagus. Delicate and elegant. My companion had the garlic roasted organic chicken in a garlic Demi glace. Simple yet perfectly executed. We ordered 3 sides. Truffle Mac and cheese( sinful), garlic mashed potatoes and a terrific creamed spinach. We also loved our bread basket filled with onion foccacia, French bread, raisin walnut pumpernickel, and three kinds of crackers. Dessert was not to be missed here!.

Looking for a top notch elite dinner we searched Yelp and Openbook for days trying to find the perfect spot to check out and hopefully enjoy for later purposes (company get togethers.) Club A is not just a Steakhouse its a family. The owner Bruno is a man of great intellect, culture, and most importantly love for the product he presents to his guests (notice I didn't say clients. When you dine with Bruno you are truly not just a paying client but a guest into his kitchen.) The meal was surprisingly well priced for a fine dinning experience and the service was out of control. The servers are very knowledgeable about the menu and the wine to pair. Most importantly to me though is Bruno's generosity with his product. If you want to know what something tastes like, he will bring you a healthy sample (wine and menu items.) The most amazing thing came after our meal. While talking to colleagues about future meals with coworkers Bruno went a step above and personally sat down with us, offered us fine Cigars, and comped wine so that we could really find out what Club A was all about. Now I am not saying he can do this for every guest, but as a members of a large corporation who travels frequently and dines at fine establishments all over the world Bruno knew exactly how to make us fall in love with Club A and Bruno himself. If you are in New York don't fall for Capital Grill, don't get pressured into the famous Chef restaurants, save some coin and get treated like a king.

5.0,5/14/2011,"What more can i say about this place, the owner Bruno literally treated us like royalty.  I took my lady here for her bday and it was a star studded treatment from beginning to end.  We got a nice romantic candle lit table by the live musical band.  Then let the 4 course dinner begin with a bottle of wine, we had: ceasar salad, fried calamari, mashed potatos and cream spinach.  I must admit my favorites were: the mashed potatos and cream spinach, the taste and flavor were perfect and literally melted in your mouth, and it complemented our filet mignon very well.  I have to be honest, the steaks were good but i've definitely had better, but the service, ambiance, and overall food was exceptional.  Then Bruno, continued his customer service by sending a staff over and sang happy bday with a HUGE dessert cake mixed with: carrot cake, tiramisu and cream puffs with my ladies name on it.  It was a great classy touch, and furthermore when we were leaving, he stopped us, and gave a large stem beautiful rose to my lady ;)  Needless to stay, class act and we had a wonderful time from start to finish.  The owner Bruno is one of a kind, very charismatic and genuinely nice guy.  I will definitely be going back!  Thanks again Bruno for a beautiful evening!  Cheers!  :)",1,0,0,chris p.,"New York, NY",30,19,0

I got another livingsocial deal of a 3 course prefixed meal with two sides and a bottle of wine. The deal itself was great. Everything from the appetizers to the entrees were awesome. We had the hanger steak and the fillet mignon, both were cooked perfectly and juicy and tender. Bruno was so kind to give us a complimentary appetizer on the house of jumbo crab meat and shrimp cocktail, two glasses of champagne and a huge fruit platter on top of everything! We felt so special! The ambiance was so romantic. We sat on the second floor, and the decor was very luxurious and the lights from the trees outside the window looked beautiful from inside. They had a live piano player and singer that night too. The service was just excellent. They took good care of us and were very attentive without hovering.

Not the waiter that attended to me, but another waiter decides to show my date an awesome balcony and then the wine cellar while I am waiting for her from coming back from the restrooms.  I'm glad Mr Tall and Scrawny wasn't my waiter.

The 10 oz. meat ordered medium was lightly pink and cooked medium well in the center and well done everywhere else, with a subpar, stringy texture.Did you know that being a yelper has perks at restaurants?

I'm not sure how I feel about that.**Thank you to Mr. Selimaj for contacting me with regards to this issue.

5.0,4/12/2011,"First time writing a review so I hope this comes out alright for all of you to read.Came here with my girlfriend for Valentine's Day, and I jumped on the 80 dollar special they were having for that day too so that's plus, not including tips and tax but still worth every penny even when I paid everything.The place was beautiful, red all over the place so it was a good setting, for the night, fire place here and there gives it a nice cozy feeling to set the mood. we got there at 8pm on the dot with a reservation, only a 5 min wait while they set up the table for us, so that's no big deal gave us time to admire the place and making me feel good that I picked a great place that night. The host was nice and our waiter was very attentive, our meal came with wine and our glass never reach empty til we finished the whole bottle.Time for the food. It was a prefix menu for that night for the 80 special, which got me thinking what's on the menu. For appetizers, I got the Canadian Bacon and my girlfriend got the Fried Calamari. The Canadian Bacon was huge and delicious! talking about it right now makes me want to go back just for it, with every bite you take you just want to savor the flavor in your mouth. The Fried Calamari was good, nice and crispy but doesn't top the Canadian Bacon, even my girlfriend had wished she pick that instead of the Calamari and she's a big Calamari lover.For the main course, I got the pork chops and mash potatoes as the side and my girlfriend got the hanger steak with fries as the side. The pork chops was a little bit dry but the apple sauce help make it so much better. The hanger steak was really good too, cooked medium well, nice and juicy. For Desert both of us got the cream puff cause they seem to be the best out of all the other deserts, and boy were we right, it was the best we ever had. My thoughts of this place? The best steakhouse I ever been to so far, great for romantic dates, anniversaries, or even as a big group that want good food.

Appetizers - Canadian Bacon was mind blowing *note it was very large and was actually perfect for two people to share. The fried calamari left things to be desired. I am a HUGE fried calamari lover and the plate was on the smaller side and was pretty tasteless. Main Course- He ordered the filet mignot which may have been the best I have ever tasted and I have had my fair share of filets. The hanger steak was also delicious and was at the opposite end of the steak spectrum.  The steaks alone were, in my opinion, worth the 80 dollars.  Sides-The mac and cheese was very yummy and I opted for the fries which were pretty good.Wine- The Malbec was very good, neither of us had a problem polishing that one off :0Desert- Now I read various reviews about the cream puffs and I was a little upset I only got two when I heard three was the norm but either way they were absolutely spectacular! Best cream puffs I have ever had.  My date ordered the tiramisu and we spent the remainder of the evening arguing whose desert was better, both of us boasting to have ordered the better one.  Do NOT skip out on desert.  So delicious.Overall a really excellent steakhouse.  Great location, ambiance, and for 120 bucks, a more than reasonable meal!",0,0,0,Sarah M.,"Brooklyn, NY",4,78,2

Their calamari was good as well; it's crispy on the outside, juicy inside, but all I can think about is the smoked bacon. The size was huge and the smoke flavor will knock you to bacon heaven. Never thought it could be made this way and I had to literally stop myself from eating too much for too much grease gets me sick so BF sliced the fat away for me. Otherwise I would have gulped the whole thing.So the steak was hanger and mignon and both of them were cooked to perfection. I stopped ordering mignon long time ago because I always felt most of the restaurants overcooked it - but that was long time ago. Yum...juicy, flavorful - wish I was younger when I had more room in my stomach. Needless to say, we couldn't finish but no sir were the leftovers were going to the trash. Leftovers were just as good the next day.The cream of spinach was delightful - not too heavy but I would SERIOUSLY skip the garlic herb fries.

5.0,4/6/2011,"I have to say, Bruno over at Club A immediately contacted me after seeing my review of our last experience at the steakhouse and offered to have us in as his personal guests, at our convenience.  His staff alerted him as soon as we arrived last Friday and he personally greeted me and apologized for our last experience.  He asked where I'd like to sit (since seating was an issue last time) and gave us a beautiful table on the first floor.  When we ordered a bottle of wine, the waiter suggested another one that might pair better with our meal.  It wasn't in a pushy, upsell kind of way...he genuinely wanted us to have the best.  The caesar salad was made tableside (a total improvement from last time) and the Canadian bacon was delish.  The staff was extremely gracious and conscientious (my fiance had to take a call that left me alone for 20 minutes) and they repeatedly checked in to see how our appetizers were without making us feel rushed.  I ordered the petite filet and my fiance ordered the 16 ounce filet.  Our waiter suggested he get the bone in filet, saying the taste was a bit richer and my fiance figured he'd take his advice.When they brought out our entrees, the meats were cooked to perfection and they brought out an additional side (the truffled mac & cheese) because they wanted us to give it a try.  And it was amazing.  The fries and potato puree were also perfectly cooked and delicious.  For dessert, they brought over a cart to make some sort of delicious berries with cream and all I remember about the cream was that there was both champagne and prosecco in it.  They also brought over a delicious fruit platter on top of the berries that hit the spot.  When we tried to tip, Bruno at first refused but we insisted - the staff had been absolutely phenomenal to us and made us feel so very welcome.  There was no awkwardness or fake kindness, they genuinely seemed dedicated to making our night lovely.As we left, my fiance personally thanked Bruno, who then invited us upstairs to listen to some live music and have another drink on the house. It was a perfect evening and we will definitely visit again.  One last point...last time I mentioned how we were sat upstairs because we had the coupon.  This time around, I took note of several couples sitting alongside us with the coupon on the first floor so it seemed that Bruno and team definitely took our feedback and adjusted their approach which I very much respect.  Bruno also followed up to ensure that we had a lovely evening and that he hoped to see us again soon.  And he will.",0,0,0,Erin D.,"New York, NY",0,16,0

The sauce that came with the hanger steak was delicious, the creamed spinach was excellent, and I would come back just for the tiramisu.

2.0,3/28/2011,"Went here a couple of months ago. The experience left me pretty blah-ed and confused. Where are all of the five-star reviews coming from? The food was mediocre. We had the calamari to start - it was cooked decently in terms of texture but completely bland in flavor.  I had the filet, which was tough - not sure how that is possible when you order it medium-rare. My boyfriend had the osso bucco and he was disappointed in it as well. The caesar salad was the best thing we consumed that night. Service - not very good either. I ordered my steak ""au poivre"" and the waiter looked at me like I was crazy, proceeded to tell me they do not offer steaks au poivre... only to come out 10 minutes later to tell me he was wrong. In all fairness, it was our waiter's first day, so I could look past the  lacking service if the meal had left any impression on me. Perhaps the chef was having a bad day - that is the only thing that could explain our experience compared to the other reviews on Yelp. 2 stars because the food was not completely inedible and the place is cozy...",0,0,0,Karolina P.,"Manhattan, NY",10,5,1

5.0,3/26/2011,"Me and my date were late for an hour for our reservation but we got seats anyway eventhough the steakhouse was quite packed. I ordered sea bass and my date ordered the 24oz prime rib eye. We shared the yukon potato purée and crab cake. I am pleasantly surprised that the staff came out with a portable stove and my entree wrapped in an aluminum bag on a trolley. He heated the bag and it ballooned up with all the steam tenderly cooking my fish. Then he cut the bag open and immediately I was hit with a sweet buttery aroma. People at the tables nearby looked on as the staff dished out the sea bass and assorted vegetables. One lady even asked the staff what is the dish he was preparing. The sea bass was soft and buttery and every bite melted on my mouth. The brussel sprouts, asparagus and broccoli were amazingly flavorful. My date's rib eye was superb as well. The crust was slightly charred which is good because it brought out the smokey meaty flavor of the steak. The inside was perfectly prepared to medium rare as ordered. With a spectacular balance of meat and fat, the whole steak was phenomenal. I was only slightly disappointed with the potato puree because it tasted like regular mashed potato. We were given a generous portion of mac and cheese on the house. For dessert, we ordered tiramisu which was also very good. My date said it was very refreshing and I thought it was because they added a tinge of orange liquor in the base layer. And to our surprise they gave us another dessert on the house. It was fresh berries top with some sort of Bavarian cream. It was very good.

5.0,3/25/2011,"I practically asked the coat check lady to pinch me to make sure that the experience that I had really happened. Yes, THAT JUST HAPPENED! Why did I not know of the place ages ago? This is by far the most romantic restaurant that I have been to in New York. And I have had some fairly fabulous dates before, including the usual suspects such as One If By Land. I took my boyfriend here for his birthday. It was absolutely perfect. I knew we were in for a treat when I saw the real, wood-burning fireplaces downstairs. not to mention the plentiful wooden shelves holding bottles of wine,  and the red velvet walls and ceilings. At first, I was disappointed when they started to lead us upstairs. BUT, I was even more impressed when I got up there. There is a grand piano in the corner and later in the night a really talented player/cabaret singer came out. He was so personable, cracking jokes, taking requests and dedications. That was definitely one of the highlights of the night. The huge full-length window looks out on the a large tree that is lit with white lights. It looked like a winter wonderland... in a good way. On to the food, and yes that was good too. We got one of their specials on the website. $80 for a couple to eat 3 courses and wine! The wine was really good too. No unmarked bottle/flasks here. It was an incredibly smooth Malbec. I will say the only downside of the experience was the salmon. It was very well cooked, but they got a little aggressive with the garlic. They love garlic here. The canadian bacon... hello! YUM!!!! The filet was excellent. I love their club A steak sauce. Dessert was a little bit of a let down. The carrot cake was one the most moist I've had in a long time, but the cream puffs...meh.Overall, I am just dying for a reason to go back!! 4.5 stars only because of the garlic.

We were seated shortly after we got our drinks, and the server transported them to our table upstairs.  We sat by the back window, also looking out on sparkling lights, and the bf smilingly said that the place seemed magical :)  The food started coming, and our assessment never dipped.  Even the onion rolls in the bread basket were phenomenal!  The only thing that didn't blow us away were the caesar salads, which were good, but a bit heavy on the dressing for me - next time I'll just ask for mine on the side.  But the steaks.  Oh my goodness, the steaks.  Delicious and perfectly done.  I had the filet mignon medium, and it was exactly how I wanted it - just pink and tender and oh so flavorful.  The bf got the hanger steak medium well with a delicious sauce, and it was also cooked to a T.  We were both beside ourselves with steak happiness (a very wonderful variety of happiness), and the sides only augmented that.  We had the whipped potatoes, which were incredibly smooth and buttery, and the truffled spinach, which was also wonderfully creamy.  We also had a bottle of surprisingly affordable malbec, which complemented the steak beautifully.  Another fun thing about Club A is their selection of decanters - our waiter chose an adorable blown glass outfit with a heart cut-out, perfect for our romantic date night :)By the time dessert came around, we were full of steak and wine, but we still enjoyed the simplicity of the cream puffs and the decadence of the carrot cake, even though we could not come close to finishing either one.  As my abundance of adjectives suggests, we loved the food.  But the service was even better - we were catered to all evening, but never in an overbearing manner.  The owner even stopped by to ask us how our meal was and where we heard of them, and when I mentioned Yelp, he smiled and said ""We love Yelp.""  Yep, we do too :)  And yes, delicious food and awesome service can make me a bit verbose, so here's the TL:DR version:GO, get an espresso martini and the filet, have your wine decanted.  Enjoy!",4,0,5,Sarah B.,"New York, NY",100,78,3

I'd turn around and my wine glass was refilled. The table was small, and it's amazing that they not only got everything to fit on there, but also served and cleared without knocking anything over. At the end of the meal, we asked for the wine label of the Malbec that we were having. We expected them to just write down the name and date of the wine on a piece of paper. But 10 mins later, they came back with the actual label from the wine, stuck to the back of a menu for us to take home!History: We even chatted to the owner, Bruno, for a while. Turns out that the restaurant used to be an Italian place for 30 years before they transformed it into a steakhouse. I am so glad that they did. Food: Melt in my mouth Canadian Bacon and a just as good steak tartar. I'm honestly not a bacon person, but I still loved my bacon. The filet mignon was perfect! Crispy and slightly charred on the outside, but juicy and busting with flavor on the inside. I couldn't stop eating! With such an amazing meal, my expectation for the dessert were too high. The tiramisu had probably too much cream and not enough liqueur. However, as we were eating, they brought over a plate of cream puffs on the house. Ambiance: Every table had a candlestick. The decor is a beautiful red that almost borderlines cliche, but somehow reaches a good balance. The view on the second floor is a romantic Christmas lights display hung on a wall of vines. At some point in the night, they switched from Frank Sinatra type house music to a live musician. This guy was great! He played all the classics and people loved it so much they started dancing on the non-existent dance floor between tables. Once dinner ended, we didn't want to leave! So we headed over to the bar for some wine and to extend our stay. Bruno came over again and signaled to the bartender that our drinks were on the house.

We sat on the second floor, which is a little quieter than the first and decorated in dark lush red - makes me think of the 1950s! We had the porterhouse for four - the steak was perfectly cooked and completely delicious. The sides were all fantastic and the service could not be beat. Everyone was super attentive and treated us to excellent service. As if the dinner weren't great enough by itself, Bruno, the owner gave our table a complimentary fruit platter that was amazing and champagne to top it off.

So I bought it, and it was worth every single dollar.The place is gorgeous, red-interior, candles lit and single red-roses on every table = incredibly romantic.The deal = 4-course meal + a bottle of wine.We started off with the fried calamari and the cream of mushroom soup, both very delicious.For our main course, I ordered the filet mignon-medium rare while my BF ordered the hanger steak-medium well. Both steaks were cooked to perfection, but my filet mignon was a little burnt on the outside so I didn't finish it. My BF's on the other hand, licked his plate clean. Our side dishes were delicious as well, garlic-herb fries and creamed spinach. We ended our meal with carrot cake and cream puffs, nothing to brag about here.I really wanted to sit upstairs but to my surprise they sat us downstairs, it wasn't packed like upstairs was, and the vibe was completely different. The upstairs seating were closely-knitted together, and overlooked the pretty-lit trees outside. The downstairs seating were more-spaced out, and more private. Overall, I'm not complaining, the deal was sweet, and we had a wonderful experience.",0,0,0,Onnicha G.,"Woodside, NY",85,116,19

5.0,3/14/2011,"I came to Club A Steakhouse last week to celebrate me and my boyfriend's 1 year anniversary. The place was very romantic and cozy.  They had a single rose in a vase at each table, which I thought was a nice touch. The restaurant was't overly packed or noisy either. We used the $80 Yelp Coupon for a 4-course meal and a bottle of wine for two, which was a great deal especially since everything was really good. I can't really tell the difference between really good wines but we got a white wine and it was fine. I ordered the steak tartare as my appetizer and it was delicious. My boyfriend had the canadian bacon, which was good but really fatty (but you feel kinda gross after you eat it but that's probably bc it's fatty bacon, not bc of how it was prepared.) I ordered the hangar steak, which was good. It was kinda on the dry side but still good. We had side orders of cream of spinach and the potato puree, both which were really good and good portions. As for dessert, I had the tiramisu, which I happily finished and my boyfriend got the cheesecake, which wasn't bad but I personally prefer my tiramisu.The service was amazing. Their waiters were very attentive and nice. There was also a man who was very nice and welcoming. I believe he was the manager. He asked how our service and food was and even offered us free champage at the bar but we were stuffed so we declined nicely. I would definitely come here again.

His operation at Club A was flawless, and atypical to a lot of restaurants, as the staff genuinely seemed to care about your service.  From making the reservation on the phone, all the way through dessert, every member of his staff was professional and accommodating, and we were not an easy bunch. I made a reservation for 4, arrived and reduced it to 3 as one of our party ditched out. ""No problem!"" and we were promptly seated. As our first bottle of wine arrived, my friend who ditched, arrived with his date, saying he changed his mind. Our four top, plated for 3, now just became 5. Again, ""No problem,"" and our table was quickly whisked to a five-top as if it were nothing. The food was great (Porterhouse for 2, for one, is always a great idea), and don't miss the Brussels sprouts with bacon. After slyly mentioning It was my friends birthday, we got a full spread of desserts, with a personal happy birthday from Bruno, complete with a round of drinks on the house. Classy.

5.0,3/10/2011,"I'm not usually a steakhouse guy -- and not because I don't like steak; to the contrary, and consternation of vegetarians, I love steak! But I like to consider myself somewhat of a grilling specialist and never really understood the need to go out and overpay for the kind of meat I could put together myself for a bunch less money.*But this isn't your standard steakhouse, and I wouldn't come here strictly for the steak. I would, however, come here to spend a wonderful Saturday night in good company, eating a host of good food and listening to one of the best lounge singers I've ever heard.The first thing you need to know in deciphering that this isn't your dad's typical steakhouse is that it's red, really red. It feels more like a club than a restaurant, but there's no stuffy club vibe at all. The hosts were incredibly welcoming, found our reservation quickly, checked our coats and has up and at our table where bread was served and we were greeted by our server in no time at all.Coming from the restaurants I usually go to, where service isn't bad, per se, but definitely more lax, the clockwork operation here was shocking and pleasant all at the same time.Our wine was poured in the world's coolest aerator and though I ended up drinking most of it, I think it really helped enhance the flavor. The food: really good, especially the bacon appetizer. Like Jonathan N. said, it's about an inch thick, succulent, deliciously fatty yet still crispy and the best thing we tasted all night. Which is not to diminish the hanger steak, which was flavorful, or the filet, which was buttery and delicious. The sides were nothing really to write home about, but I'm not in a temple du meat if I'm really excited about creamed spinach or french fries.However, the thing that really kicked this up to a five-star rating is the ambiance -- definitely make sure to sit upstairs if you can, the view out the window to a Christmas light-like display on the tree outside is beautiful, and there's more room to move around. In addition, and most importantly, try to go on Friday or Saturday nights after 9:30 or so -- there's a lounge singer who does everything from classic Italian steakhouse fare (from some guy you might have heard of -- a Yelper named Frank S.) to Lady Gaga to Irish drinking songs. We had so much fun listening and possibly singing along** that we're tempted to come back and just sit at the small bar in the front of the upstairs just to listen to him again.A fantastic place that I'd be happy to bring friends from out of town. Just make sure to make a reservation.* - Which inevitably lead to me buying a three pound roast and challenging Adam Richman for the title of ""idiot who eats too much food before finally putting it away"".** - Alice?

The food is good but pricey but if you have a big date and they like steak, it may just be the right place. You definitely have some privacy as far as table space and distance to other tables which is nice. The filet was cooked correctly (medium) and tasted great.

The filets were cooked and seasoned perfectly and everything was delicious from the apps to the sides to the deserts. And lets not forget the comped lobster raviolis, delish!  I could tell from the other diners around us that their food was equally as good. The service was also excellent. It was our Anniversary and they certainly took care of us. We used the Yelp deal and they were very accommodating to our needs.  We didn't feel that there was any differential treatment because of the deal.Let me just say, I've had steaks alone that cost as much as this entire deal and they were not as good as this.

Service is impeccable, both the owner and the waiters go out of their way to satisy the customers. The decor is warm and ambiance is romantic, lighting is perfect, you can see what you eat yet feel intimate. We ordered the calamari and steak tartare, calamari was subpar steak tartare was tasty. Since I love a good fillet mignon I decided to give it a try. I ordered it medium, it came out to be medium rare. Although the texture was right I was expecting more blood coming out of my steak as i cut it. It was a little peculiar, pinkish meat yet no blood, perhaps it is due to the aging process? Cream spinach tasted good, mash patatoes were average. The Argentinian wine that came with the $80 prepaid deal beat my expectations. The deserts were very commercial, almost tasted like the ones I buy from Costco. Not that Costco deserts are tasteless but I expected something that tasted homemade. And deserts should be homemade. The surprise was at the end when we recieved the check, apparently the $80 deal was originally priced $160, therefore we were charged tax based on the $160 which was a little weird. I did not see such a clause on yelp disclosure or on the certificate. With the tips and the additional tax the night cost us wround $130.

We got there and we asked for upstairs seating (as this was recommended by other Yelpers! as it is more romantic and live music is played here at 9:30 from Wed-Sun) but they gave us downstairs due to a private party. They offered to move us up later in the night during coffee/drinks. Downstairs was nice (old school steakhouse from the 50s/bordelloesque feel). We had oysters (wow!!!), lobster and a thick cut of canadian bacon appetizers (all tasty and huge portions!!) and then a porterhouse steak for two (we ordered it rare and they listened - it was GREAT!). Food was superb!!!!  At the end of the night they moved us up, it was beautiful and the music was being performed by this eccentric old school type crooner. The setup was a laptop, a classical piano, chimes.  Both my boyfriend and I were both wondering what was ahead of us. During the beginning he put on a little techno/disco music while he mingled at tables, drank dirty martinis.  During this time, 6 waiters came to my boyfriend with tiramasu, ice cream and cheese cake and sang happy birthday!! They were so kind!Then the crooner began playing and singing-- Amazing -- what a amazing voice!! He played oldies like Sinatra, Morrison, Presley.

FANTASTIC.  I was just glad that i wasn't the steak knief they were using because i swear i could hear how much force they were putting into cutting that steak... and the plate.I think only reason I would've EVER considered giving this place 3 stars is because of their steak.  It was pretty good, but even without that music or those two korean ex-lovers or lovers trying to kill each other over there dinner, the steak was definitely not that of an elite steakhouse.i was disappointed.  i'd much rather go somewhere like benjamin steakhouse....

3.0,2/21/2011,"I was here for Valentine's Day Weekend and the ambiance certainly worked - Valentine's Day balloons, sexy Frank Sinatra tunes in the background and an all around romantic-vibe.   But, in my opinion, the food was 'meh.  I asked for my steak medium rare and it was more like 'medium raw'.  Same with my date's steak.  We were pretty wowed by the size of the seafood royal appetizer platter we shared - shrimp cocktail with three GIGANTIC shrimp for each of us, a lobster tail EACH and crab meat.  But the quantity was more impressive than the quality.  The prices were steep and so I was hoping for tastier food but, in view of the raving reviews before mine, I'd definitely try it again if given the opportunity.",1,0,0,Meri S.,"New York, NY",50,137,0
5.0,2/21/2011,"I came with my girlfriend the day after Valentine's and was very impressed.  Food was fantastic and service was good.  A tiny bit annoyed at first because the waiter didn't give us the restaurant week menu even when we asked for it.  I wanted to at least look at it.  That's okay, I'm glad we stuck to the regular a la carte menu.  We ordered the Canadian bacon, truffle mac and cheese and their porterhouse for two. Canadian bacon:Fantastic!  Thick and juicy.  Just the right amount of meat and fat.  Came with a side of sauce that tasted like a mix of cocktail sauce and BBQ sauce.  Surprisingly good dip for the bacon.  You should definitely order this. Truffle mac and cheese:Full of truffle flavor and cheesy goodness!  The texture was decent.. a bit watery I would say but overall a very delicious mac and cheese as a side with the steak.Porterhouse for 2:A very large piece of steak.. probably about 40 oz including the bone.  A perfect medium rare with already cut pieces when it comes out.  The waiter even served pieces of steak continuously.  Perhaps not the best porterhouse I've ever had but still a very juicy and flavorful steak.The service was impeccable.  Definitely get the warm feeling of an Italian family restaurant but with a romantic setting.  The owner came around to each table greeting guests which is always a nice touch.  The decor was pretty good.. my girlfriend thought it was a bit too red and overdone.  But in general, we thoroughly enjoyed our dinner at Club A.  Would definitely recommend it!",1,1,0,Jonathan C.,"Brooklyn, NY",119,85,19
4.0,2/20/2011,"My boyfriend went there on a Yelp special discount they were offering a 3 course meal for 80 dollars (a steal!) The place is close to public transportation and relatively easy to find. I walked in and felt a little intimidated but the staff there treated us like everyone else, for which I was quite grateful. Apparently this restaurant participated in NYC's famed Restaurant Week quite often and so there was a preset menu of choices to choose from. I had the well done fillet mignon and it was delicious but the real star of the meal were the pureed potatoes. They were DELICIOUS! Loved them. The cream puff dessert was also just so delicious. The waiters were attentive but not in your face and I thought it was nice that they took it upon themselves to refill your wine glass. It's definitely a great steakhouse.

5.0,2/20/2011,"Club A Steakhouse is an illustration of a great dining experience.  They may not have served the best steak I've ever had, but the whole evening was too nice to deny it a 5 star experience.We took advantage of the $80 Yelp deal (which gives you a 4 course dinner for two with a bottle of wine) and booked a last minute reservation for a late Friday evening dinner.We hung out at the bar for bit after checking in our coats (and bags) before making our way upstairs to our table.  The restaurant oozes the color red in its decor from its furnishings to its walls.  The entire northside of the restaurant faces window which gives view to the giant tree decorated in lights outside which gives off a very romantic ambience.  My fiance and I don't believe in celebrating Valentine's Day, but did admit it would have been a great choice for anyone looking to celebrate it.To start off, my fiance chose the steak tartar, which was flavorful and light, while I opted for the behemoth that was the sizzling Canadian bacon.  Don't be duped into thinking you're going to get some dinky Jimmy Dean slice.  This slab was nearly a foot long, flavorful, and like pure butter in your mouth.  Amazing.We waited a bit between our appetizer and entrees, but I'm not sure if it was because it was so late in the evening.  Eventually though, my fiance got her Osso Bucco (veal shank over risotto) while I got my filet mignon.  The Osso Bucco was tender, and my steak could have been seasoned a bit more, but was cooked very well.  We also shared our sides of potato puree which was really good, and the creamed spinach with truffle oil which has me craving creamed spinach for the first time in my life.By the time dessert rolled around, I was too full from the entire bottle of wine I had just imbibed (my fiance doesn't drink) and the huge meal, so they kindly packed up our carrot cake (which we tried later and were happy with), but did have enough space to take down the tiramisu.  Some of the best tiramisu I've ever had.The service was friendly, and accommodating, and the place was just pure fun.  It's a good place to go to, but you'd be a fool not to ever take advantage of the deal if it's ever offered again",1,2,1,Philip N.,"San Ramon, CA",67,248,89

I also thought the staff was very friendly and accomodation.However, I just didnt LOVE the food. We bought the Yelp deal so maybe we missed out on a few dishes due to our limited menu. I thought the sizzling bacon was great, but the steak tar tar was only so so. My fiance got the filet while I got the Veal Osso Bucco. The Filet was somewhat underwhelming. A little tough considering she ordered it medium rare. My veal osso bucco was a highlight for me, but not enough to save the entire meal. For sides, the creamed spinach was good but the fries were pretty soggy. For dessert, we got the carrot cake and the cream puffs. Both were kinda meh.Now I'm not a scumbag. I appreciate the generosity. For $80 total, that meal for 2 (including a bottle of decent wine) was amazing. I would do it again and again.

The meat was really low quality and the filet mignon was really tough. I didn't know that it could happen. We were so disappointed since it was a steakhouse, and we expected that at least the steak would be good, if not the sides. However, the sides were greasy and the service was awful.The owner tried to make it up to us, but the filet that he gave us the second time was tougher than the first one! Horrible! Then they gave us extra dessert and glasses of prosecco. But, it just doesn't make up for giving us and other customers the lowest quality steak they could find. Everyone in the restaurant was eating on this coupon. I can't blame them, we were doing the same. It would be much much worse to pay full price. I will not come back.

They only give you the option of 1 type of red (Malbec) or white wine with the Yelp deal.Appetizers - we sharedThe Mixed Green Salad was nothing better than any other restaurant. Please try something else.Entrees - we sharedFilet MignonThe 10 oz Filet Mignon which we ordered medium rare was cooked properly in the inside, but the outside was burnt beyond recognition. Later on we mentioned it and they told us they would replace it if we wanted. Still, the meat wasn't anything great, just OK. The normal size and price would have been 16 oz  for $42 which means we at $26 worth of meat and it was just OK and not mouth watery.Hanger SteakI believe I had the Hanger Steak which was better than the Filet Mignon, but I didn't see online.Desserts - we sharedTiramisu was the same as any other restaurant and according to my friend probably came from a package.Freshly made cream puffs tasted like it was store bought.Shortcomings on deals:Yelp or any other deals you get always have something you gain and loose. You gain by going to restaurants that you would rarely ever go b/c of the cost or there are just too many restaurants so it is hard for any one of them to stick out unless they offer you a deal. The losing side is you get smaller portions and limited selection. Here they went with 10oz Filet Mignon and 1 type of red or white wine.The Yelp Deal info:Two (a $160 value) at Club A SteakhouseYelp exclusive 4-course menu for two includes a bottle of wine, appetizer, entree, side dish & dessertA variety of options offered for each course - entrees include the Pan Seared Wild King Salmon, 10 oz Filet Mignon and Veal Shank Osso BucoBy reservation only - mention Deal Certificate when making reservations and present it to host staff when you check in",0,0,0,Fikre D.,"Alexandria, VA",7,13,0

5.0,2/16/2011,"Words cannot express how grateful I am to Club A.  I had bought a deal from LivingSocial which I was planning on using for my boyfriend's birthday since we love our steak.  Turns out the site was displaying that the coupon I had bought for $75 was expiring on 10/1/11, but was expired on 1/10/11 on the actual printout of the coupon.  I started to freak out since that's $75 down the drain for naught.  So I decided to call Club A to see if anything could be done even though this is completely not their mistake.  The first person I talked to (a woman), told me there was nothing to be done about it because it has expired and they don't run that deal anymore.  I kept begging her to help me out so she nonchalantly told me someone in charge will call me tommorrow.  I figured no one would call me back, so I called again.  The same shpeel, it's expired, they can't do anything about it.  I kept asking if there was anything they can do at all since I really wanted to try out their restaurant.  He finally relented after speaking to the manager and told me they can give me a $75 credit on my meal and I thought that was better than losing my money.  I was told to ask for Bruno, when I get there to get my credit.When I got there, I felt like I was at a Big Boys place.  It was missing cigars and maybe a few glasses of scotch.  The place was intimate, dark and upscale--complete with your suits.  To me, the decor was done well, and not tacky.  A modern take on an old school steakhouse.  Bruno came down to meet me and immediately knew my situation already.  It was almost like he was waiting for me.  I told him thanks for helping me out when I was in a bind and he told me I didn't need to thank him cause I bought this dinner, and I should still get it.  I thought that was super nice.  When I got to my table, I realized they were giving me the same deal I had bought originally(including a free bottle of wine), and not just a $75 credit off a normal dinner.  I was SO HAPPY.  This was above and beyond what they needed to do.  Honestly, they specified the expirartion date, LivingSocial did not display it correctly; Club A literally did not have any obligation to do anything else.  But they did anyway, even though out of the $75 deal (for a $160 dinner), they only get $30 out of it.  I was truly amazed they were this generous.Everyone here has already critiqued the food and ambiance from the Yelp Deal.  But I'll give a run-down anyway:-Steak tartare:  Just the right amount of acid, and salt from the capers.  Delicious and well-balanced flavors with the texture (it is afterall raw meat)-Carrot Soup: Creamy and sweet from pureed carrots.-Veal Shank Osso Bucco:  I love Osso Bucco.  There's something reminiscent of a rainy day in and  sweat pants.  It's comfort food where the meat is braised for hours, and the meat literally falls off the bone with a touch of your fork.  I feel like this dish is overlooked for everyone who comes here since everyone orders the filet mignon.  But believe me, you will not regret the flavors nor the amount of skill and effort in creating this dish.-Filet Mignon: Steak is traditionally supposed to be ordered Medium, where the inside is pink and the tiniest bit of blood oozes out.  They cooked this steak perfectly (I've seen disasters at other places).  The outside is charred with a flavorful crust.  The Bernaise sauce was so velvety and just enough tart to balance the steak, but was completely unneccessary--if you wanted to just eat the steak on its own, the flavors held up.-Truffle Oil Creamed Spinach:  How can anyone not like truffle oil?  I love creamed spinach; so putting these two together was a great match.  I will say, that the spinach was heavy on the truffle oil, so it became very rich.  But, hey I can never get enough truffle oil.  I'd drink that stuff.-Garlic fries: Nice crisp outside, soft and tender on the inside.  Just enough salt and garlic flavor.  -Tiramisu: So light, airy and delicious.  I love me a well done tiramisu.  -Carrot cake:  huge chunks of walnuts give this cake a great textural contrast.  Great cream cheese frosting.I will definitely be back for that porterhouse sometime soon.  Top-notch food with top-notch service.  Thank you again Bruno for helping us out!  This will be my go-to steakhouse from now on.",1,0,0,Lisa Y.,"New York, NY",32,101,3
3.0,2/16/2011,"The Yelp deal was phenomenal, but you could tell that Club A was having capacity issues the evening we came.

Fortunately, their bartender was amazing, and she was able to keep two us of entertained during our wait. Not sure how the other 20-ish people fared, however.The capacity issues continued into our meal. The servers brought out our bread and drinks punctually, but then took about 45 minutes for our appetizers. 10 minutes later, our entrees came, and the porkchop and side of mashed potatoes were already cold. Filet was OK, and our creamed spinach was mediocre. It took too long to attract our servers' attention as they were scrambling around to all the other diners, so we quietly finished our meal without even bringing it up.All in, very satisfactory meal for the price, but not given our expectations and other reviews.

Thank you, Yelp, for the $80 coupon which allowed a friend and I to enjoy a spectacular meal consisting of 1 bottle of wine and 2 appetizers, 2 entrees, 2 sides, and 2 desserts! First of all, you absolutely can't beat that pricing.I loved the ambiance at this restaurant - romantic red hues and coziness all around with a fireplace on each floor. The lighting on the first floor seemed a little dimmer than the second floor, perfect for an intimate date. The second floor had a huge window with a view of the tree with sparkling lights in front of the restaurant - very special!Now, on to the food...1. Bread: Now people say not to judge a book by its cover, but I always judge a restaurant by its bread. Our bread basket was wonderful! There was an assortment of soft raisin rolls, garlic rolls, and a crunchier baguette - something for everyone. 2. Appetizers: We ordered the Calamari and the Canadian Bacon. The calamari was very delicious, but ladies and gentlemen, the bacon simply blew me away...you get a very large slab of sizzling, juicy, fatty, flavorful ham. It's a MUST ORDER ITEM!! 3. Entrees: We got salmon and filet mignon (ordered medium rare). I don't think I have ever had filet cooked the way Club A does - a little more charred and crispy on the outside, but definitely very delicious and still perfectly medium rare on the inside. 4. Sides: Truffle creamed spinach and mashed potatoes - both very good, especially the truffle spinach! 5. Dessert: We both had the cream puffs - also delicious, although at this point we were so stuffed we couldn't even finish.Along with ALL of the above, we also had a fantastic bottle of red wine. The only thing that wasn't absolutely perfect was that they dimmed the lights a little late on the second floor and also the service could have been smoother.

DON'T go here!!  RESERVATIONS:  After dealing with a rude reservation staff by phone...from the minute you walk in, (after you notice the lovely décor)  you will find yourself among quite an untrained staff which will become a sure source of frustration.  (Seems like the owner spent all the money on the décor and NONE on the professionalism necessary successfully run a restaurant business.)  Was commanded to check in our coats, only to have to wait behind couples who just walked in behind us and didn't even have their coats ready (manager stoodby just watching!)--unacceptable.Was checked in not once, not twice...but THREE times (once during the MIDDLE of service by our waiter!!  Unacceptable!!)  And for what?  The place was not even packed...and I ended up wishing we hadn't reserved!!SERVICE:  Untrained, novice waitstaff who are not only untrained on the menu (don't bother asking questions about the menu) but don't know a single thing about wines (this place desperately needs a sommelier!!).  Also inattentive (have had better service at a chain restaurant ...) and so incredibly slow on service, had to fill up on bread not only in the beginning, but also after apps!And even though we told them we were dining from the restaurant menu when we checked in (they ASK almost as if they decide how to treat you for the rest of the evening based on that answer), we were given a regular menu by the waiter and NOT provided a restaurant week menu, forcing us to ASK for one (to which they respond snobbishly and return almost as if annoyed at YOU!)  Unacceptable.DRINKS:  Asked for several different bottles of wine on the menu but turns out they were out of all of them (one I can understand, but multiple bottles?  Are these just for show?)  Ended up paying 2006 prices for a just barely born bottle of wine that wasn't even on the wine list! Also unacceptable!!FOOD:  Overpriced and mediocre.  Steak was overcooked (unacceptable for a steakhouse!) and prep was so long, we ran through two whole servings of bread, half the wine, and even had time to get hungry AGAIN after apps!  DÉCOR: Decor is what initially drew me, with romantic red atmosphere inside (definitely not a business dining location)... but turned quite unromantic with songs like the theme song from Rocky amongst several cheesy others (no money for a full night of classic romantic melodies?)  A few times, the music cut out in the middle altogether and you could hear comments nearby: ""did they really just cut off the music?""  Totally unacceptable.  Again, it seems like after paying off the upholstery, there's no money to pay for a piano player for the piano sitting silently on the second floor (if it's even real....).  Totally unacceptable.  Now it seems the owners only use the décor to lure in customers since nothing else will.NOTE:  Watch out for the seating...i found that they seemed to follow a ""diversity"" seating arrangement.  Manager was walking around the restaurant but didn't bother asking ANY of the tables in the room how things were going (coincidentally, we were seated in the seemingly ""diverse area""); hopefully he overheard the SEVERAL tables of unhappy patrons complaining to each other about all the same things during what otherwise all hoped would've  been a romantic dinner experience.   I bonded more with the complaining tables next to us than with this restaurant.  Unacceptable experience overall.My date and I spent the rest of the evening nursing upset stomachs and trying to rid the bitter taste of disappointment from our memory.",0,0,0,Bo C.,"New York, NY",0,2,0

2.0,2/13/2011,"After reading all the positive reviews here, we also purchased the Yelp offering. I don't often write a review unless I am very surprised in a good or not so good way by a restaurant. Unfortunately, I was disappointed with this place. I am confused by this restaurant because either the food is spotty or the reviews have been overly inflated. For the price $80.00 with a bottle of wine, the food is okay and it's worth a try. I have to agree with the reviewer below who said the service wasn't good, and I usually overlook service. Food is what is important to me. They quickly sat you, gave you the special menu and returned so quickly I didn't even have a chance to read it. And they wanted the entire order with dessert. I felt like I was at a wedding the whole time. Appetizers came quickly and were good overall. My husband and I had the cauliflower soup which was nothing special, my friends had the bacon (probably the best choice here and was good) and calamari, which looked small and not that appetizing. Three of us had the filet and my husband had the salmon. The filet was pretty good but nothing I would rave about. I can see how it could be dry if you order anything but rare. Certainly not comparable to the numerous steak house in NYC that I have been to. Perhaps equal to a Outback or Ruth Chris at it's best, but no where equal to Lugers.  The portion was adequate. My husband had the salmon and he said it wasn't fresh and was dry. Sides were okay. The spinach was the typical creamed variety and was good. The garlic fries tasted fine but were soggy. We had a long wait for out entree and not once did they come over to refill our bread basket or to tell us the food would be coming. Nor did they ever came to see if the food was alright.  Desserts were surprisinly good and I am not really a dessert person. I found the cream puffs and tiramisu fresh and delicious. The wine was very good also, but I am not that much of a drinker. They never came over to give us a bill so we left and then they found us. I never checked to see how much they taxed us on..the $80.00 or the $160.00. That would have pissed me off too.  The place is pretty, quiet and comfortable. Perfect for Valentines Day since it's all red! The manager seemed eager to please but then you don't see him till you walk out and we didn't complain. I would suggest he walk around more and make sure it doesn't take a hour for your food to come out. Overall, not bad for the price, but won't go back. Too many better restaurants. Just to add, we saw people leaving who raved to the manager, but they appeared to be the ones who ordered off the regular menu. I did see a steak come out that was sizzling and looked and smelled very good. Unfortunately, this meal didn't leave me wanting to come back and try again.",0,0,0,DEnise S.,"Queens, NY",23,75,3
1.0,2/12/2011,"Very very similar experience as Tim J.  Maybe we had the same waiter.  After reading all of the positive reviews on Yelp, my girlfriend chose this restaurant from every one in the city to take me for my birthday dinner.  After she made the reservations, she checked back and saw the deal for the 4 course dinner for 2 for $80 and bought it, why wouldn't you, it's a great value.  Unfortunately it turned into some of the worst service we've experienced.  We ordered all four courses at once and received our appetizers in a timely fashion.  Then...the wheels started falling off the bus.  After about 30 minutes of waiting for our steaks with no explanation or even an acknowledgement from the waiter that he didn't completely forget about us, we had to flag him down to see what the issue was.  We both ordered our steaks medium well and when we got them they could be defined as nothing else but rare.  I'm sorry but 40 mins for a steak that comes out the exact opposite as the way you ordered it is a bad joke.  We had to send the steaks back to the kitchen and when they came back to us they were now complete hockey pucks.  Perhaps they finally realized they screwed up and decided to try and compensate by giving us two sides on the house, which would have been nice... except they gave us sides we already had-- cause that makes sense. At the end of the meal, they had the nerve to act surprised when we didn't want to take home any of the leftovers. All in all, one of the worst dissapointments in a while.  We spoke to some ladies at the coat check on our way out and they said they had a good experience that night, but were ordering off the menu. I know that Club A reads their yelp reviews so here is my advice to you... You have a beautiful place but if you are going to resent people taking you up on your $80 offer and treat them to inferior service just don't bother.  Your reputation will be better off for it.",2,1,0,Chris D.,"Astoria, NY",0,3,1

Boy.was.I.wrong.The thing is, I'm honestly not even that hard to please and it's very difficult to get me mad. Their service--or severe lack thereof-- was such a disgrace that my blood was boiling. They never came to check in on us, decided we didn't need water, and after apps they even decided we didn't need dinner. It took 40 minutes for the main course to show up. Fast forward through a whole undercooked then severely overcooked scenario and they actually brought out dessert with a candle and happy birthday written on the plate. Cute gesture, if they didn't completely mess up the rest of the meal. That also means that they actually remembered that we were celebrating a special ocassion and STILL had the audacity to treat us like second class citizens. Unbelievable.

The view outside was the lit up tree in the front. I felt like I wasn't even in the city. First, we got an assortment of bread in our bread basket- baguette, garlic, and raisin! RAISIN!! I've never gotten raisin! For the apps, we ordered the fried calamari and the caesar salad. HUGE portions, so by now I was quite full. Both of us had the 10oz filet mignon, a little over cooked for me, but still delicious. The steak came with creamed spinach and mash potatoes on the side, which were both phenomenal. And for dessert, we got the homemade tiramisu and the carrot cake. The tiramisu was absolutely delicious and the carrot cake even more delicious. And all of this for $35 a person!?? CRAZY.

1.0,2/12/2011,"Good food, but the service here was so bad I'll never come back.I was excited when I got an email from Yelp about a 4-course dinner for two at Club A for $80 ($160 value--- an important number later).2 appetizers, 2 entrees, 2 sides, 2 desserts and 1 bottle of wine for $80 is an outstanding deal. However, once we were seated and placed our orders, we were literally not spoken to again. The food was delivered in a fair amount of time, but not once did our waiter ask us if anything was ok, or if we wanted anything else (my girlfriend would've ordered some coffee after dessert, I would've ordered another drink). After our meal was finished and plates were cleared (again, w/o any verbal interaction at all) we sat there for a good 15 minutes until we had to specifically ask to be brought our check.Remember, this was a pre-paid $80 deal. However when they brought the check for the tax, they taxed us for the $160 ""value"", which is total b.s.If you charge $80 for a meal, and the customer pays $80, then the tax should be on $80.It's really disappointing to leave what was actually pretty decent food with such a bad taste in my mouth.

4.0,2/9/2011,"As a steakhouse with ""Steakhouse"" in the name no less, this is a very contradictory and nearly ironic restaurant experience, as the only thing I didn't enjoy was the filet mignon.AtmosphereLet me start with first impressions.  Even before we walked in the door, we were delighted with the way the restaurant looked from the outside.  Christmas had just passed, and there was a tree right outside lit up with brilliant white lights. Upon entering this finely decorated establishment, the eyes are greeted with grandly themed bar lit by delightful combinations of red and black, countertops and velvet paddings. Our coats were quickly taken care of and the maitre d swiftly sat us down at a small table upstairs.  A grand piano was situated in the corner, however unfortunately no one was there to man it this evening; with live music I'm sure it would have been a magnificent atmosphere.On our table was a strange decanter, shaped in the form of a snake. This was the coolest decanter I had ever witnessed, so naturally I had to ask the waiter to do it again while I videotaped, and he politely consented. FoodMost of the food was fantastic.  The calamari was not too rubbery but not too crispy, the creamed spinach was amazing.  The pre-meal bread was even incredible with the help of the freshly whipped and super creamy butter. Even the desserts were excellent, the cream puffs literally melted in your mouth (sometimes a few seconds before... didn't quite make it) and the tiramisu was full of rich flavor and also very creamy.Unfortunately the steak was very disappointing. It was overcooked, definitely not a medium rare. It was difficult to chew until you got to the very middle, and even then it was not juicy enough to be tasty. We ended up barely being able to choke it down.All in all, this is a very nice place. The atmosphere, most of the dishes were amazing, except the one dish I expected to be amazing.",0,0,0,Jon W.,"New York, NY",73,31,7
3.0,2/8/2011,"I came here for restaurant week friday 02/04. The establishment is nice and cozy, but my only complaint is that it was cramped. Our chairs were touching other table's chairs and I just felt that there was not enough spacing. I read that the 2nd floor is beautiful but i was seated on the 1st floor. My party of 4 started out with a bottle of Cabernet that was pretty good priced around 55 bucks (the wine is reasonably priced). The food on the regular menu is also not too pricey.For appetizers, I had the Canadian bacon which was juicy, fatty and just perfect. The steak tartare was also very good. The calamari was nothing special and i recommend you guys to stay away from that. For my entree I had the osso bucco. This was cooked very well and it was tender and tasty. The rest of my group ordered the hanger steak and filet mignon. The hanger steak was cooked well and had alot of taste but of course that cut of meat isn't great so i wasn't expecting much. The filet mignon wasn't good. It was overcooked, dry and cooked medium to medium well even though my friends asked for it to be cooked medium rare. The sides we ordered rated from 1 - 5:cream of spinach: 2mac and cheese: 4fries: 3Mashed potatoes: 4When it came time for dessert i was too stuffed so i just had a small bite of everyone's dessert. The tiramisu was pretty good but the cream puffs and carrot cake were just bad.I would have gave this place 4 stars but the food was subpar. If i only tasted the food i ordered (canadian bacon, osso bucco and tiramisu), I would have been satisfied but the food my party ordered wasn't as good.

While this restaurant is not cheap, the atmosphere is very calm and one feels much more comfortable than in the hustle and bustle of a more 'name brand' steakhouse like The Palm or Ruth's Chris.

4.0,2/7/2011,"Club A steakhouse doesn't give off that steakhouse feel at all. I'd say it's simple and beautiful high end American restaurant. Each table was topped with a tall candle and a single red rose, very romantic. The service was good but nothing to write home about. I came here for their restaurant week ($35) dinner and found it to be one of the best values available. I got one of their Chardonnay's and honestly it was probably the best I've ever had (I wish I remembered what it was). For an appetizer I got the thick cut Canadian bacon which was a single slice but it was 1/4"" thick, incredibly tender with a great grill flavor and served with an addictive steak sauce. For an entree I got the 10oz fillet Mignon with whipped potatoes. This was a great value as most other steakhouses during restaurant week don't offer that cut or if they do, they offer either 10oz without a side or 8oz with a side. I should have asked for them to bring back out the steak sauce (though it didn't need it). It was cooked perfectly but wasn't really seasoned with anything and wasn't the best I've ever had (that award still goes to Delmonico's with Angelo and Maxies taking second). I also got to try the lamb shank osso bucco which was a huge portion and cooked correctly but was a little too bland for my liking. For a dessert I got the carrot cake. This came extremely cold with the top cream cheese frosting almost frozen. The portion of it was small but not too small and the flavor was great, I just wish it tasted fresher (or not like they just took a slice out of the fridge moments ago).

5.0,2/6/2011,"I've never been to a more romantic restaurant in NYC!My boyfriend and I came here to celebrate Valentine's Day early since we won't be able to on the 14th. We took advantage of Restaurant Week, and I'm so glad we picked Club A Steakhouse! They offered plenty of choices in each category, and there were no supplemental charges for anything on the menu, which can sometimes be a drag during Restaurant Week. The restaurant is decorated in lush red and burgundy, and the pictures truly don't do it justice. We walked in, and there were two roaring fireplaces going, and it took my breath away. The lovely hostess took our coats, and we were escorted upstairs. At first, I wished we could stay downstairs with the fireplaces, until We reached the upstairs and the glow of the giant tree covered in lights outside made the upstairs room absolutely spectacular looking. There was also a back room which looked like it was covered in illuminated vines that also looked awesome. We sat at a large sized table for two, and they lit a long single white candle for us, which made the lush single red rose on the table twinkle. They had a sumptuous basket of bread with butter presented to us, filled with onion brioche rolls, french baguettes,  raisin nut bread, etc. DELICIOUS! For appetizers we ordered the Canadian Bacon and the Calamari. The bacon was giant and flavorful without being too fatty and came with a yummy sauce. The calamari was the perfect texture and the marinara it came with was sweet and delicious. By this time we were already full, they gave us so much food!!Then came the entrees: I ordered the hanger steak and he got the prime pork chops. When his plate came my mouth was on the floor. They served two GIANT chops, and it was enough for two complete meals all on its own! My hanger steak was a 10 oz portion, pre sliced, medium rare, and perfect. There was just enough chare on it, and the sauce served on the side just added to the flavor. We chose the truffle oil infused creamed spinach, which was excellent, if not extremely rich!Usually desserts at a steakhouse are just an extra and usually pretty mediocre, but the cream puffs and tiramisu were to die for. We just kept looking at each other and laughing and saying ""Outrageous"" to each other. The cream puffs were the better of the two shockingly enough, but both were excellent. We were enjoying each others company in the romantic atmosphere, talking and laughing well after the plates had been cleared. No one ever asked us if we wanted the check, which we thought was awesome. We never felt rushed, even though the place was packed. They just kept refilling our waters over and over (they were never less than half full), until we asked for the check about a half hour or so later. Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful service. We never felt like we were being treated any less special because we were Restaurant Week customers. From the decor to the service to the food the place is 5 stars and a MUST for any couple in the city.

You probably need to make reservations ahead of time, if you want to get the designated time and seats you want. But, if you do wait, there is a bar to kill time. The service was good and they always refill your empty cup. In terms of food, I ordered the Caesar salad w/ shaved parmasean, Filet mignon (medium rare), Creamed Spinach, and tiramisu for dessert. The salad was mediocre, but fresh. Salad can only be so good lol. The filet mignon was definitely worth having, and is pretty juicy. It was only 10 oz., but its restaurant week what do u expect? it was a good steak, but nowhere close to Peter Luger status. The Highpoint of the meal was probably the Creamed Spinach, it basically tastes like melted gold. I was so stuffed from the meal, I didnt even finish my tiramasu, but it was mediocre.

3.0,1/31/2011,"Reading thru all the other reviews posted for this place made me think that maybe I am either too picky or had a fluke experience.  Either way, I think there are plenty of other steakhouses in the city that I don't have to try this again to see if my experience will change.First off - my sister and I tried this place out since they had an AWESOME deal on Yelp: 3 courses + a bottle of wine for 2 ppl for only $80.  For that alone, it probably deserves more stars.  The service was attentive and polite, despite the fact that we were using this ""coupon"", so for that I am grateful not to be treated as a 2nd class guest.  Our glasses were never empty and the servers checked on us enough to know we weren't forgotten.In terms of ambiance, this place is very romantic and cozy.  We were seated upstairs, and you could see the Christmas lights on the tree tops from both the front windows and the back windows - very pretty!Now onto the food...perhaps this is an unfair review bc we didn't get to select from the entire menu.  My friend SWEARS by their mac & cheese, but unfortunately that was not an option for us...*sniff*Food:1) Bread - nothing spectacular, but the butter was awesome...LOL.  I am a fan of any place that uses GOOD butter.2) Calamari - large portion for one person as an appetizer.  I would've been full if I finished the whole thing.  My sister was not a huge fan of the breading (a little crumbly).  The accompanying marinara sauce was delicious though.3) Mushroom soup (soup du jour) - my sister was expecting a creamy soup, but I thought this was pretty good.  Not too heavy on the mushroom flavor, although a tad salty for me.4) Filet mignon - we both ordered this,  and now I regret not getting the hanger steak as other reviewers mentioned.  Mine was slightly more done than I like (I prefer med-rare, but it came out more med).  My sister said hers was a little too charred on the outside for her liking.5) Creamed spinach - I'm personally not a huge fan of creamed spinach, so I'm thinking my review of this may not be accurate for all.6) Garlic Herb Fries - disappointing.  Plenty of herb flavor but not much garlic.  I was even more disappointed when some of the fries didn't seem fully cooked and some were soggy.7) Carrot cake - moist, although nothing spectacular.  The icing was slightly sour, which was kind of weird for me.8) Tiramisu - just OK.Based on my experience, you can see why I don't understand all the hype around this place.  If they had at least gotten the steak right (as I assume a steakhouse could), I would've been more of a fan.  Unfortunately, that alone would push me to try a different steakhouse next time.  I WILL say that it was worth the $80 deal, but I would've been upset if I had to pay full price for that.On a side note - several tables got the porterhouse for 2, which smelled amazing (it comes out sliced on a sizzling plate).  Maybe I will have to return to try that and the mac & cheese...",0,1,0,Tricia R.,"Ballwin, MO",41,231,0
5.0,1/30/2011,"HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!No Kidding, If I was a Michelin editor, ClubA definitely deserves two stars.I am so serious that I even check the standard for a two-star Michelin ranking represents ""excellent cuisine, worth a detour"", yes, if you came to visit New York City or somewhere near, this place is certainly worth a detour.We are here for 2011 NYC Winter Restaurant Week, and is the BEST dining experience in NYC EVER!The manager is so warm and so kind, he led me to my table without even asking me anything, simply said, please come in, it's very cold outside and your friends are waiting for you (probably it is obvious that I was with two other Asian girls, lol). Oh.. and every waiter is so friendly and sweet, too. For appetizer, I was thinking to order steak tartare, then our waitress, Ardi, reminded me that this is raw meat, we even had a conversation about the sushi and sashimi, it is so funny that he doesn't eat raw meat but he does love sushi/sashimi. He recommended the Calamari or Canadian Bacon... the Holy Pig as Jonathan referred. But we thought steak would be heavy enough so we all made lighter choices (2 salads/ 1 soup of the day - Broccoli Soup) and they are good, but now I wish I had ordered the Canadian Bacon. Next time!btw, of course this is the kind of restaurant that you don't have to mention which plate goes to whom, they remember it and just serve the plate directly to you. :)The bread basket is also very good and their butter is so delicious, we finished all the bread with their butter, amazing.While we finished our appetizer, the manager came and brought us another bottle of kenwood red wine on the house....... Even though they doubt if we could finish two bottle. :pThe decanters are very exquisite. Our second bottle was severed with a snake shaped decanter which is also a gauge of a glass of wine (you need to turn into certain angle to pour out the wine, very intersting). For Entrée, we all ordered 10 oz Filet Mignon (Reasonalbe, since we are in a steakhouse ^_^).My Filet Mignon - medium - was exactly the way I want my steak to be cooked. It is slightly charred on the surface but perfect pink in the middle, I am not a meat lover but I can tell this is a succulent steak.My roommate's medium-well is a little bit over-cooked for her, she thought medium well will be more pink, but that's actually a medium. I cut one piece of mine for her and she said she should have ordered mine. Lol.We shared the side dishes, 2 truffle Oil Infused Creamed Spinach, 1 Whipped Yukon Potato Puree, and we got truffle mac & cheese on the house, they are all delicious. The Creamed Spanish is probably the best I've ever had, with the aroma of truffle oil balance the creamed, yum!Because they gave us so much food and wine, I was so full (and I am the type of girl who eat A LOT!) and I decided to take a break... I went to check upstairs because my roommates both told me how beautiful it is. The upstairs are quite amazing, with one side of the street view shows all the Christmas lightening on the trees and..... blocks the snow storm....hmmm.... (serious, a huge snow storm hit New York that night).The other side is a private room with the bamboo decoration, very unique design and good for any private events. the bartender upstairs was very nice and we talked a little bit. He showed me how to slide the door to separate the private room and told me that's the real bamboo and how much he likes this idea.The other waiter, Tony, who is friend with our waiter also talked with us a lot that night (they are also roommates, too). While I went back to my seat, another sweet suprise from ClubA! Tony was ready to make us strawberries with homemade zabaione, table side. We named our beautiful tiramisu with strawberry zabaione ""TONY'S SPECIAL!""I wish I could upload the video when Tony was making the zabaione! =)I was really full so I could not finish the tiramisu, but I finished all the homemade zabaione. The most amazing thing is as Asians grow up in Asia, we usually don't drink ice water. I normally don't ask for water without ice, but my roommate did that night, and the busboy still remembered it after 3 hours while Ardi was refilling my roommate's glass. The busboy promptly reminded him that she wants water without ice, they quickly grab a clean glass on next table and reserved a glass of water without ice. How sweet!Ok maybe you can say I am bias, but I am, for this service. How could I not be? and the food is also delicious. We definitely had a great night here, I think I tip like 45% because I had such a wonderful dining experience. I will love to come back or bring my personal important meeting in this restaurant.

I obviously cannot recommend you to dine here but the steak was good and perhaps your experience won't be as shitty as mine. The only reason why they're getting 2 Yelps is because the 10oz filet mignon was pretty damn good (top 15 steaks) I've ever had and the bacon appetizer was also really good.This evening started off really nice and I'll tell you why:+ Our table was ready when we got there and was a nice corner table+ The interior is lined in everything RED. RED RED AND MORE RED. It is my favorite color and this place screams in red. LOVE IT.+ Sound dampening red ceiling keeps the crowded dining room's noise level at a decent decibel level+ Filet Mignon was quite good+ The bacon appetizer was also damn good+ The upstairs has beautiful christmas light lined trees overlooking the street...classy.+ The bartender upstairs was actually quite friendly, Cory I think was his name.+ Good side dishes - mashes potatoes and creamed spinach. The typical side dishes for moo cow food.Then as the evening went on we started to notice that things were going downhill and here's why:- Our waiter Artie was very quite unfriendly and curt. Upon asking for the wine bottle and the decanter, he made some general comments about the price of wine and people's thoughts on what they're ordering and how they're focused on the price in relation to taste. Umm, excuse me, I don't need YOU to tell me anything about wine, let alone the fact that you aren't the restaurant's sommelier. If I ask for your recommendation, you give it...otherwise keep your mouth shut on what people's opinions are on price vs quality vs decanting the wine or not.- We had requested a different decanter for the 2nd bottle of wine which was sitting on the decanter stand right behind our table. They weren't too happy that we did this - mind you folks that they took the decanter AWAY from our table? who does this? - Had to ask several times for olive oil for our bread- We ordered our wine and wanted to wait before ordering the appetizers - there was complete confusion in the dining room between the dining team as we were asked by 5 different waiters if we were ready to order. FFS guys - get your act together! COMMUNICATE!- We ordered the steak tartare butttt calimari showed up? umm. How about the waiter checks what he's bringing to the table?And then for the finale folks:- I had asked for the manager who was in a pinstripe suit and he goes by the name of Bruno. He was completely unwilling to hear my frustrations of the evening and instead was more focused on buying us a drink upstairs at the bar. So we followed him upstairs as he bought us a drink and after an argument ensued between him and I, we had one sip of our drinks and left. An almost shouting match then ensued between us upon my departure as I told him he has absolutely no idea how to run a restaurant. He then complained that we sat there for 3 hours and that's all he kept repeating!!! WTF?! I didn't know there was a LAW stating that we couldn't sit at a restaurant for 3 hours? We even ordered 2 bottles of wine...so hey Bruno, go screw yourself. It's sad that a restaurant that's rated this well has a douchebag as a manager. I then proceeded to tell him that I sit in restaurants for 5-6 hours so he's lucky he only saw my face for 3.Side foodstuffs note:- the dessert we had was tiramisu which was missing the typical tiramisu type items (lady fingers, cream, etc) and instead was a pile of whip cream that we received. There was no resemblance of anything except whip cream! ugh!save your money and go somewhere else for restaurant week in NYCThis has been a review by Gaurav",5,3,0,Gaurav P.,"New York, NY",486,512,2436
4.0,1/29/2011,"We went to Club A for restaurant week, it's a place I've wanted to try for some time, and unlike some places they had a good selection on offering for the restaurant week menu. Appetizers and sides were a cut above standard steakhouse fare, the caesar dressing was excellent as were the whipped potatoes and sauteed asparagus. The filet was a nice cut of meat, cooked to perfection. Desert was really good, both the cream puffs and tiramisu. Service was good without being intrusive, wine and water glasses constantly topped off. Wine list was decent, heavy on California Cabernets and Italy, would like to see more variety there, but their corkage fee is reasonable so you can always bring your own.",0,0,0,Jon J.,"Strongsville, OH",5,87,0
5.0,1/28/2011,"Two words can sum up the steak I had at Club A last night: Holy Cow! And two words can sum up the Canadian bacon I had as an appetizer: Holy Pig! Combine those two delectable cuts of meat with a $35 prixe fixe menu and a $25 bottle of red wine for Restaurant Week and you've got the makings of one hell of a meal.A few more words on that (Holy Pig!) Canadian bacon: It was about an inch thick, deliciously crispy on the outside, and plump and juice in the middle. I've never had anything like it and my mouth is watering now just thinking about it.But it wasn't enough to satisfy my carnivorous cravings. I also had the 10 ounce filet, cooked perfectly medium with a bit of charred texture on the surface and a perfect pink center. My date had hers at medium rare and it was slightly more red than mine, as it should have been. She also had the fried calamari to start and it was quite good. Holy Squid!For dessert I made room -- barely -- for the tiramisu, while my date opted for the carrot cake. Both were beyond good, if not quite as spectacular as the rest of the meal.The space is quite comfortable, as it's draped in red velvet and features Frank Sinatra tunes being pumped through the sound system. The service was also excellent -- attentive without being annoying.I had never heard of Club A until yesterday but I sure am glad to have found it. I'll definitely be back for another meat-fest.",6,6,7,Jonathan N.,"New Orleans, LA",1470,258,53
5.0,1/26/2011,"I took my boyfriend to Club A Steakhouse for his birthday and we were both really impressed by their food, service, and decor.  Overall, it was delicious and I would go back for a special occasion.Appetizers:Calamari - Good but I've had better.  It wasn't as crunchy as I prefer.Bacon - This is a large cut of Canadian bacon.  I didn't think I would like it but it was surprisingly flavorful.  It had a nice grilled flavor to it.Entrees:10 oz fillet Mignon - I got this cooked medium and it was very tender and flavorful.  It was seared nicely on the outside with just enough char. When I go back, I would consider getting everything cooked rare rather than medium because there was very little pink in the medium.  However, the medium was cooked so well that I still loved it.12 0z hangar steak - He got this cooked medium and it was marinated really well and so juicy.  Again, I would consider getting this rare next time.Sides:Potato Puree - This is basically amazing mashed potatoes.  It had a nice hint of garlic that nicely complimented the full flavors of our steaks.Truffle Oil Creamed Spinach - hands down the best creamed spinach I've ever had.  The truffle oil makes the creamed spinach really light rather than the usual heavy flavor.  Desserts:Homemade Cream Puffs - Best dessert we tried.  It was so light and fluffy.

5.0,1/21/2011,"As it turns out, I'm a bit of an alcoholic.Let me explain:I got the Yelp deal here to take my friend out as a thank you for dogsitting for me and my boyfriend next week when we go to Vegas (EXCITED!). The deal sounded great: $80 for a three course meal + wine... I figured I would get out of there for about $100 total with tip which is pretty great for dinner for two.Instead, I got to the restaurant, found my friend drinking a glass of wine at the bar, and promptly ordered a martini (exceptionally well-made). Our wine was quickly decanted for us (a decent Malbec) and the food started coming. I had steak tartare and the hangar steak, she had carrot soup and the filet. All of it was tasty -- well cooked, well-portioned. Not five star food, by any means, but solid steakhouse fare. Then it was time for dessert.So why the five star rating? Well, before dessert, I decided to have an after dinner drink. I have always been rather partial to armagnac, and even though the cheapest glass of the stuff was $25, I decided to splurge. After all, I had already enjoyed half a bottle of wine and a huge martini... I was buzzed and I wanted to really get my buzz on. The waiter brought it over promptly and filled the glass at the table (the service here, by the way, is nothing short of impeccable). Then Bruno came over to chat with us for a minute, my friend ordered a bourbon on the rocks, and our desserts came out. Desserts were pretty standard (tiramisu and cream puffs) but tasty.Then, as we were sitting around talking after the desserts, another waiter came by with the magic rolling booze cart. I guess some people get free champagne here, but we got comped our choice of home-made grappa, limoncello, or sambuca. I kid you not. Apparently they reserve this booze cart for the heavy drinkers. I happily obliged them (and me) with a huge pour of grappa. They even put some booze soaked grapes in the glass. My friend got the limoncello, which was also excellent.Then we paid our check and as we were getting our coats on, Bruno offered us a parting shot. Who am I to say no to a parting shot? It was SoCo lime or some such awful thing, but by that point I was feel pretty good and definitely wasn't going to say no.

The place is flat out awesome, from the reasonable prices (by Manhattan standards) to the decor and of course the food. It is very well decorated with a red rose and candle light, the service is impeccable, attentive and watchful but not overbearing and definitely no hurrying you along. I had the Canadian bacon appetizer, which for $5 was not only delicious but huge, it was thick and salty. For my entree I had the 16oz Fillet cooked to perfection, the portions are extremely generous for the price. My side dish was the mac and cheese with truffles, this is something i wish was offered everywhere, the truffles took the mac and cheese to a new level. For dessert I had the chocolate mouse, which definitely did not disappoint. Also, the wine list ranged from $40 bottles to accommodate the common folks but you could go nuts on bottles priced over $1,000.

4.0,1/17/2011,"I was another LivingSocial coupon person (the 3 course meal for $75 w/wine).I'm definitely pleased I purchased the coupon but not entirely sure I'd do it again. I would go back, but maybe not with the coupon. We were seated in what was obviously the Living Social Section where the 6 other couples also had the coupon. We were all seated really close together, so if the people next to you are obnoxious it can detract from the atmosphere. I wasn't exactly the most romantic date I've ever been on. But on the other hand, the couple to my right ordered most of the same things we did so I got a constant preview of what I was about to eat. heh. The service was really amazing - I think the biggest thing that makes this place worth absolutely every penny and then some is the service. Everyone in there is incredibly attentive and friendly. The wine was also super great, I wish I'd remembered the name of it. I got the filet mignon and it was pretty good. I have very oddly strong opinions about baked variations of gourmet mac & cheese and TBH, it wasn't even in my top five. I was sad about that, since I love truffled mac & cheese.  Their desserts redeemed any sort of sadness I felt about the mac & cheese though - we had the cream puffs and the tiramisu and I could eat my weight in both of them. If I go again I just want to eat the steak and all of their desserts. The weirdest part of the experience was the music. Their music was this medley of things like Fly Me to the Moon and various unremarkable jazzy or Italian things up until....The Rocky Theme. In it's entirety. I started laughing so hard I couldn't breathe and everyone around us were having a ""...wait what?"" moment as well.

Beautifully fried and served piping hot, this plate of calamari was not chewy/rubbery at all. If these were frozen, then I definitely had no idea.Entree: Filet MignonActually not the best I've had. This was an unusually thick slice, about 2 1/2"" thick. I ordered it medium, which I got, but the outside was particularly charred. It was fine, just not something I was used to. The center was certainly tender, and melted in the mouth. Served with a steak sauce that was (I swear) ketchup but.. fancier/more flavorful. If you eat here you'll know what I mean. Side: Lobster Macaroni and CheeseThe only lobster flavor came from the pieces of actual lobster, and the mac and cheese had some good flavor to it. A small layer of melted cheddar(?) topped it off in addition to the creamy cheese the pasta was in. Stand alone, this was quite tasty, but it didn't exactly complement the steak.(My friend's) Side: Yukon Potato PureeLet's be real. It was freakin' mashed potatoes. The texture makes this noteworthy simply because it was smooth as heck, pressed through a strainer no doubt. Dessert: TiramisuNice, but not outstanding. You could get an equally good slice at your local Italian bakery.(Mt friend's) Dessert: Cream PuffsAgain, nice but not outstanding. Quality pastry with a smooth creamy filling and soft bread-like outer portion. I think you get three? I was too busy with my tiramisu to notice.Wine: RedI'm am absolutely not a wine connoisseur nor that much of a fan, but I followed the rule of thumb: red wine for red meat, white wine for white meat/fish. If you don't like red wine normally, I think you'll like this one. Sweet, smooth, and -definitely- not dry. I guess that makes it.. wet? Hah, not sure, but it was easy to drink and we didn't expect to finish the bottle.FAQ.. ATTIRE!: This is always a big question! As long as you are not wearing jeans, a T-shirt, nor sneakers, you should be good. Unless you are so ridiculously rich, don't give a crap, and will spend more than $800 then I guess they won't really care either!Overall a solid 4 stars simply because I prefer my filet mignon not as thick and not as charred, and because a few of the items were good but not outstanding as you'd expect a high end restaurant to be.Still, I'd absolutely return if they hooked up with LivingSocial again.",4,2,0,Daphne M.,"ASTORIA, NY",66,246,97

5.0,12/8/2010,"John, a Lunch Belle reader from Florida, asked me and a friend to join him for dinner at Club A Steakhouse during his recent business venture in NYC.  For me - a woman who, by fault, doesn't take herself that seriously - receiving an invitation to dine with one of my readers was both flattering and exciting.  Without question, I invited my dear Emily, who just so happens to be my biggest cheer leader and unofficial publicist.Unlike some of its competitors who are located on ""grittier"" blocks of NYC - ahem, Keen's Steakhouse or Peter Luger - Club A Steakhouse resides in one of East 58th Street's ""dime a dozen,"" pristinely-maintained brownstones.  And it's location, believe it or not, is what truly sets this particular ""beef shrine"" apart.  Diners seem a tad bit more elegant and sophisticated, a trait that lends in creating a more demure and, coincidentally, romantic atmosphere.Em and I chose to arrive on the earlier side of our 7pm reservation so that we could briefly catch up over a glass of wine at the restaurant's bar.  Between sips of pinot noir and nibbles of CAS's (Club A Steakhouse) devilishly delicious house-made potato chips, 7pm quickly approached, as did our gracious host.When John arrived, we greeted one another as if we'd been the closest of friends for years.  Actually, there is some truth to that statement, because John and I have been in contact for a couple of years.  Although he resides in the southeast, he makes frequent trips to NYC for both business and pleasure.  And prior to his arrivals, John typically emails me for restaurant recommendations, namely with his daughter, the theater buff, in tow.The three of us were immediately whisked off to our spacious round table, which was covered with a crisp, white cloth.  A single, tall dripping candle and a vase containing one freshly-cut pink rose adorned the table top.Our meal began with a bottle of red, a bountiful bread and butter basket, and a small tray dotted with Greek olives and nuggets of parmesan cheese.After perusing CAS's menu, we chose to begin with the Extra-Thick Sizzling Canadian Bacon.  Assuming that it would be similar to the version I've had at Peter Luger, I was completely surprised by what was actually presented.  CAS's bacon was at least three times the size of what is served at Luger's, meaning that there was much more succulent, smoky, and slightly caramelized meat.  For all of you pork lovers out there, this dish ranks at the top of my ""must try before you die"" list.  Absolutely phenomenal.  Quite possibly, this bacon could put an end to world wars if given as a peace offering.  Trust me, this hunk of love will change your life.For my entree, I ordered the bone-in filet mignon, to be prepared medium-rare.  With a selection of seven side sauces, I chose the creamy-mushroom as an accompaniment to my steak.  And for the table, we agreed to split three side dishes: truffle macaroni & cheese, hashbrown potatoes, and creamed spinach.Not since my experience at Wolfgang's Steakhouse have I had such a quality cut of beef that was perfectly charred on the outside and moist and buttery on the inside.  Each bite was more tender and rich than the last.  Of the side dishes, all three were equally outstanding but, if I had to choose just one, then the hasbrowns would take home the trophy.  A crisp and salty exterior gave way to a pillow-soft interior.  As if tons of bread and butter, bacon, steak, and three rich side dishes weren't enough, our server returned to make strawberries with homemade zabaione, table-side.~Oh, what a night!  After dinner, we retired to CAS's second floor, where we sipped champagne and listened to live music.  From everything that encompassed CAS - decor, food, drink, and service - to my fabulous company, I had the pleasure of experiencing one of the most memorable and magical meals since the inception of The Lunch Belle.  Thanks again, John.",0,0,0,Lindsay F.,"New York, NY",376,277,184

As with movies, I become worried that raised expectations of a restaurant will result in me leaving with a feeling of disappointment; I'm happy to say I couldn't have been more satisfied when I left.From the moment we walked into the primarily red-themed main dining room, Bruno and his staff went out of their way to ensure we were comfortable. Because we came for RW, it was a prix fixe menu. Between the four of us, we were able to try most everything offered, and I can say it was one of the best meals of my life.The food itself was great, but what really set the experience apart was the attentive service and the special touch provided by the owner.Throughout the meal, we noticed Bruno constantly walking around the main dining room and interacting with all of the guest: answering any questions, offering interested tidbits of information, ensuring everything was exceeding expectations. When our meal ended, we were offered a complementary drink in the lounge upstairs. There was a gentleman playing the piano and entertaining the guests. If you have the option to choose, I would recommend the upstairs lounge as there is an amazing level of excitement...at least on a Friday night!Will definitely return, especially if I am playing host to family or friends, or need a place to celebrate a special occasion!Note: There seemed to be a mix between casual and dressy parties.

Here's why:When we randomly chose this restaurant on yelp, I debated whether 51 reviews was enough to be considered worthy of one of my precious meals in NYC. I'm so glad that we decided to try it. Upon entering the cute and warm restaurant, the owner and Frank (our waiter) welcomed us offering us an empty table for 2 in the middle of an very full lower dining room or ""the best table in the house upstairs."" We chose to check out the upstairs. Another great choice! We sat by ourselves overlooking the street below us with Christmas lights everywhere and Frank Sinatra playing in the background.Our meal started with 4 different kinds of warm delicious bread. Then continued on to 42 oz of Aged Dry Rub Porterhouse Steak for 2 with creamed spinach, german hash browns, and mac n cheese baked in truffle oil. The steak arrived precut with bone still on a sizzling plate. Our waiter Frank served us 2 pieces of filet side and 2 pieces of the NY each along with a scoop of each side dish. We were really impressed with the presentation and the service. At the end of the meal we were absolutely stuffed and couldn't even finish the delicious side dishes. It was like we had 3 private waiters (busboy, water/bread person, and our waiter), so we felt very well served beyond what we expected.THEN, to top it all off they brought us dessert ON THE HOUSE. First a plate with a slice of carrot cake, a slice of cheesecake, and 2 cream puffs with mocha ice cream with chocolate swirled on top. THEN, Frank, pushed over a small serving table with a hot plate and made us this fruit with fresh made cream dessert.

But we felt like eating steak anyway (other place was more for sausages) so I searched for a steak place nearby on yelp, and found here.

Freshness is the key.

We both expected to get subpar service because we were using my living social coupon, but it was NOT the case. When the maitre'd noticed that i was using the coupon he didn't seem disappointed or mad about it at all. He had a sincere smile and was very accommodating since we showed up to the restaurant a 20 minutes early of our reservation. We got seated, and they brought us water. The living social deal was great; it offered us 50% off on a 3 course meal for 2 as well as a bottle of wine. The atmosphere of the restaurant was awesome. It was dimly lit, so it had a very romantic setting. When we got seated, one of waiters lighted a candle and indicated that our table was very romantic. We got a bottle of 2009 Argentinian Malbec. It was fresh, and fruity. It was smooth and it went really well with our steaks. They poured the bottle into one of coolest looking decanters i ever saw. They have a whole variety of decanters, which is really cool. Each table got their own special shape. For apps, she ordered the fried calamari while i had the Caesar salad. The fried calamari was a huge portion, which definitely could have been satisfactory for 2-3 people. It was thick cuts of squid, and they were breaded and fried to perfection. The marinara sauce had a lot of flavor to it. The Caesar salad came with shaved parmesan and croutons. The salad was a bit soggy due to the fact of the dressing, but it was a nice complement to the heavy calamari. Even though it was soggy, the salad itself tasted very refreshing because they did not douse the whole salad with dressing.For entrees, she ordered the 10 oz filet mignon med rare and I got the hanger steak med rare. Both steaks were seasoned and cooked to perfection. We didn't need any sauces. I didnt expect a hanger steak to be so tender but it was. And the filet mignon was so much bigger than we expected. Eating the middle of the steak was like eating a tuna sashimi, that's how well they cooked it. It was heaven in our mouths. For sides we got the lobster mac and cheese and truffled creamed spinach. Both were divine and the best mac and cheese and creamed spinach we ever had. The lobster bits were more thicker than the ones served at dylan prime. I believe they also added truffle to the mac and cheese. The creamed spinach was soooo creamy and good. The truffle flavor enhanced the dish perfectly.For dessert, she had the tiramisu, and i had the creamed puffs. Both were very delicate and not too rich. It was awesomeOverall, the food was great. It deserves a full 5 stars. The service was also impeccable, also deserving 5 stars. Throughout the night, we had like 5 different servers helping us whether it was pouring us more wine, pouring us more water, giving us our food, taking away our empty plates, and asking how everything. Even the manager came by our table and asked how everything was. This place is top notch, and deserves all the praise in the world.

I went with my boyfriend after buying the $75 3-course meal for two from Living Social recognizing the AMAZING deal that a $75 dinner for two at a steakhouse is. We were not disappointed! The fillet mignon he ordered was perfectly medium-rare throughout, and a much more flavorful piece of steak than FM usually is. My hanger steak was also quite delicious. The food was very well portioned overall -- we only left feeling a little stuffed, and that was because everything was worthy of continuing to eat past the point of fullness. I would recommend this joint over Luger's any day of the week, even at their normal prices. The creamed spinach here is absolutely perfect and the lobster mac & cheese was sweet and buttery. The best surprise of all (to me) was that the bottle of wine that came with the meal was totally decent! I can't say the same for the $50 bottle we had to buy at Luger's when we went last year.The only thing on which I sadly cannot comment is dessert; we were so full that we decided to wrap the desserts up to take home, and then absent-mindedly left them sitting out on the kitchen table overnight.

It was a great ambiance and there is of course the lounge singer which can only make the night that much more entertaining.  The downstairs is nice too but more like the place where you would take your parents, whereas upstairs is great for a Romantic night.Bathrooms are clean, staff is courteous, there is a free coat check, and they make wine service an artform....OVERall: A MUST if you are in NYC.",2,1,3,Mardory V.,"New York, NY",463,508,2114

5.0,10/21/2010,"This place was phenomenal, and shame on me for forgetting to review it right away.  MY GIRLFRIEND took me here for my birthday dinner, and we took advantage of the awesome Living Social deal of $75 for a prix fix dinner for 2 with a bottle of wine.The place oozes old school NY steakhouse style and glitz, and every member of staff is on hand, polite and courteous.  From the moment we walked in, to the moment we stepped out, we were treat like family (more on that later)For appetizer, I ordered the thick cut Canadian bacon.  I'm a Brit, I love bacon.  I'd bathe in bacon if it was a liquid, and I thoroughly enjoyed this.  The bacon was nice and fatty, with a good dosing of salt - perfectly savoury.  For main course, I got the hanger steak  and my girl got the fillet Mignon both medium rare. Each came out cooked perfectly, my hanger steak having a great char, and being deep in flavor. I think it's my favorite cut now.  The lobster mac and mashed potatoes were both pretty good, absolutely nothing to gripe about.Back to the service - like we mentioned, the waitstaff was superb.  I was expecting to be treated differently because we were using a deal that was cutting the price of the meal more than in half, but it wasn't the case at all.  As we were leaving, the owner of the steakhouse came over to talk.  We chatted for a while and he talked about how his young granddaughter often comes in and so my girlfriend made her customary post-dinner origami turtle from a dollar bill for him to give to her. He was so touched that he invited us to have a drink at the bar, at which point his daughter came in with his granddaughter, who promptly starts playing with the origami turtle :) He was kind enough treated us to another round of drinks before we left, for my birthday.I can't fit enough superlatives into the review for this place, it's the best steakhouse I've been to in the US to date on the basis of service and unbelievable courtesy alone.  I don't think any other high-tier steakhouse in NY would treat you in the same way.",1,2,3,Ken P.,"Brooklyn, NY",38,60,0

Let me start by saying that it was incredibly romantic--the decor, the ambiance (light Sinatra music, flowers)--while at the same time not being a place where you have to feel selfconscious about being middle class and out for a nice evening rather than upper crust. We each had the calamari and fillet, which were just outstanding. The creamed spinach was also good, but the lobster mac and cheese was amazing--rich but not overwhelming! Dessert (cream puffs and carrot cake) were also delicious. The service was just top notch, too. Our waiter was attentive without being all up in our evening.

From the moment we sat down to the moment we left, we were treated well.  Servers always talked to you with a smile.  They seemed to know when to interrupt us and when not to.  Because of that, it made the dining experience that much more memorable.The food: Slab of bacon, Porterhouse (medium rare), creamed spinach, whipped potatoes, hash browns, truffle mac.Bacon was (is) amazing.  It's probably the best slab of bacon that I've had at a steakhouse.  The steak was perfectly cooked.  I wouldn't have minded a bit more salt on the outside prior to the sear, but still very good.  All of the sides were good.  The creamed spinach had a nice balance to it.  Whipped potatoes had the perfect consistency.  Truffle mac was good, but needed more flavor (maybe a saltier cheese).  Hash browns were decent, but not memorable.Conclusion: The food was good.  The service made everything shine.",1,0,0,Christopher L.,"New York, NY",2,44,1
4.0,9/30/2010,"I too took advantage of the Living social $75 3 course meal with a of wine for two. Coincidentally K. and I ordered the exact same items as Lily T. on her review: Fried Calamari - This was good however this is the smallest portion of calamari I've ever seen! Usually an order of calamari comes in one big mound, but this came with 17 pcs of calamari. It was enough for us but it still was a small portion of fried calamari I've ever seen. Bacon - sooo fatty, but I loved every bit of it. Much better than Peter Luger where I had this for the very first time. Salty, fatty, thick.... just the way bacon was meant to be. Fillet Mignon- Cooked perfectly~ between rare and medium rare, very tender. Skirt Steak - We asked for rare and was also cooked perfectly. Cream puffs & Tiramisu - Cream puffs seemed like they were just taken out of the freezer not very good. Tiramisu was decent but nothing notable. The Service - was good, we did not need to pour our own wine the entire evening. The atmosphere - very red, very dark and can be somewhat romantic with the long candle at our table, nice view of the tree's outside with the pretty lights. It was also pretty empty on a Wed. evening, I wonder if it's like that on the weekends? The bill - This is my very first time taking advantage a deal like this so I was a bit surprised when the bill arrived. The bill without any discounts was $165 before tax, but since we purchased a meal coupon online for $75 I expected to be taxed on the $75 only. Instead they bill you tax on the $165 which I thought was weird, but what do I know. Anywho we saved about $100 off this meal so it was a steal!

5.0,9/25/2010,"Syndi & Serge were taking a trip to NYC & Niagara Falls.  A difficult trip to plan, Syndi began, as it was also for Serge's birthday and she wanted it to be perfect...Before the trip, she decided to check out the Living Social coupons that she gets in SD, for NYC.  I thought what a great way to try some cool places for great prices. I got one for a Club A Steakhouse.   You get a lot of restaurants that arent so great so I decided to check their reviews before I purchased.  They had stellar reviews, most everyone who ate there had something great to say!  When I looked at the deal, it was an amazing deal . . . 3 course dinner & bottle of wine FOR 2- $75.00!!!  I couldn't wait to go!!!  I needed a special place to celebrate Serge's birthday away from home and this would be perfect.  I called to make the reservation.  The guy that answered the phone was such a delight.  His name was Arnon (sp) and he was the owner, Bruno's son, one of 3 that worked there.  He was great and made me feel really excited about coming there, we had a lovely conversation, I felt like I knew him personally. What I loved about these guys was that they didn't do what a lot of restaurants do, they didn't put their least expensive food from their real menu as the items to choose from for this special deal menu, they had great choices.  The only thing I could possibly say that was less than a '10' for me was the bread.  We started with a bread basket that was OK.  It was cold bread, not hot and I prefer hot. There were a few choices and it was fresh, it just didn't entice me to eat it, I'll leave it at that. I had the Caesar salad and Serge had the Garden Salad.  Mine was so delicious, the dressing was perfect and I left off the grated cheese.  We had a bottle of Cabernet with dinner and it added making everything so wonderful.  The timing of the food arriving was also perfect.  I had a 10 oz. Filet Mignon cooked perfectly red inside and grilled delicious on the outside - clean, without spices.  Serge had a Hangar Steak well done that they brought already sliced for him which he loved.  (I think that was something they had just for the special as I dont see it on the regular menu but were told it was similar to the strip steak.)  For our sides, I had the Whipped Yukon Potato Puree that were so good that the boyfriend couldn't keep his fork out!!  But his side was equally delicious, the creamed spinach, just perfect, not too salty.  For our dessert, we split the Tiramisu and Creme Puffs, so delicious!!!  But what was so special was that they wrote HAPPY BIRTHDAY SERGE on his plate and the piano player, who was so great, sang to him.  It was a beautiful night.  But it gets better . . . in all of our fun, we left behind under the table, a caricature print we had drawn for us down at the piers. It was a funny picture of Syndi & Serge dressed in cocktail gown & tux with a big heart on top and was funny, romantic & lovely all at once.  We called later that night and I spoke with another brother, Agron (sp) who again, was so delightful and pleasant.  I asked if they would just put it behind the bar for us and we would come pick it up the next day, Saturday.  As Saturday came and went, Agron actually CALLED ME!  He called because he knew we would be leaving town soon and they were closed on Sunday and didnt want us to miss getting our picture!  Now that is service and just plain classy.  We told him we would be in before closing that evening.  We did go in around 8PM that evening and there on the mantle out in front where all the guests walk in, next to the photographs of the family, the beautiful baby niece . . . is the caricature of Syndi & Serge!!  Agron came out and he told us that people were coming in all night and asking them, ""Who are those people?"", and he would answer . . . ""That's Syndi & Serge from San Diego"". He said they liked it sitting there.  I got an idea and asked if he wanted to keep it for a while and he actually said they did!  So we left Serge & Syndi to continue to dine in their favorite restaurant in NYC, CLUB A Steakhouse until they decide to ship it back to me.  But what a great place, great people and great experience.  I come from a family that has owned restaurants for over 50 years and one is still a top steakhouse in it's own city and I can tell you, this place is as good as it gets. If you're near NYC, you have to visit for the food, the piano player, the ambiance, or just stop by to meet the family . . . they all exceed anything you can ask for.  Thank you for a wonderful experience. You made my trip to NYC the best by making that special night excellent for me and Serge.  Just so anyone knows, the actual cost of our whole meal would have been around $163 with two 3 course meals, dessert, a bottle of wine & tax. Add 20% for tip (and dont forget to tip the piano player!!) because they are worth the special service and it is just short of $200 for 2 for an amazing night with entertainment & ambiance.",1,0,1,Cindy R.,"San Diego, CA",2,27,15

No sneakers, etc.As for the food:  A-.  The canadian bacon appetizer was delicious... and the fried calamari was pretty good- but nothing to rave about.  I've had better... ( Sequoia's blue corn batter calamari for example) but it definitely didn't suck...lol. The filet mignon was AWESOME.  I wish i ordered medium rare, rather than medium-well.  I didn't care for the house steaksauce, since it tasted more like cocktail sauce than anything else. I mean, come ON.  Anyway, the sides rocked...truffle infused creamed spinach and lobster mac apps nearly brought tears to my eyes.  DEE-FRIGGIN-LISCIOUS!As for dessert, the house tirimisu was yummy.

5.0,9/11/2010,"Walking into this place, I was skeptical. It was a Saturday night and most of the tables were empty. There was nobody up front to welcome us into the restaurant and show us to a table. But soon a nice gentleman, who I later guess is either the owner or manager of the place, offers us a table upstairs. If you come here, ask to be seated upstairs. The wall facing the street is a floor to ceiling window with view of the street, and the tree just outside is covered and lighted with lights.The booths are deep and comfortable, and even come with throw pillows. The chandeliers add a nice touch, as well as the jazz playing lightly over the speakers. And now on to the best part - the food. I had the hangar steak, rare, with a side of creamed spinach. The steak was cooked and seasoned perfectly - the center was lukewarm to cool, as I like my rare steaks. The creamed spinach was delicious. Halfway through the meal the man who seated us came by to every table and asked how everything was - which I thought was a nice touch. The staff was attentive, but not overbearing - staying just out of sight but still letting us know that they're there if we needed anything, never rushing us.

The menu- the regular menu looked very good, however, we had the RW menu which was comprehensive and had a number of very good choices. 4.

It was amazing, made perfectly which you unfortunately never see anymore. perfect in every way.   For our entrees we both had the 10 oz filet mignon, YES 10oz filet mignon on a RW menu...unheard of! we also had the creamed spinach and mashed potatoes which were great.  the owner sent over an order of the truffled lobster mac and cheese which was insanely good and a nice touch.   For dessert we had the cream puffs and tiramasu, both great BUT the crown on the night was the TABLESIDE zabaigione over fresh berries which was on the house.  very special.Frankly, if you've read my other reviews you know I don't gush, Well here I am, recommending that you try this restaurant, because when you combine the graciousness of the staff, the great food and overall ambiance, you will find yourself leaving with a smile, as I did.

The appetizers were really nice, we liked the beef tartare. I ordered 10oz filet mignon for main course, and the meat was tender and nicely cooked (medium-rare). I wished the meat could be a little juicier but it was still not bad. Personally I think 10oz for filet mignon is enough to taste the meat and not too much that actually makes you sick. The desserts were really good too. Both the home-made creamy puff and tiramisu were rich and delicious. If you don't like creamy and richness dessert, they are probably not for you.

The steak tartar was delicious and came with a small side salad of field greens. It was excellent but the thick cut bacon was ethereal and stole the show. A moist cut of heaven that is more reminiscent of Canadian bacon than the bacon we normally would have for breakfast. Its up there with the Peter Luger and Wolfgang's bacon!Main: A 10oz. cut of filet mignon. It was great but I felt it was a little more than the medium that I requested. A great steak but just can't compete with the other great steakhouses. Please don't get me wrong, its like saying that a Porsche is an inferior car compared to a Ferrari or Lamborgini. It maybe true but its still an excellent car.I would like to echo what numerous reviewers have already stated concerning the excellent service. It was prompt, efficient, and one of our dining companions had to have her pork chops returned to the kitchen numerous because the center was raw. Sorry tapeworm is something we would like to avoid.

My steak was a bit dry, but my wife's was juicier than mine and the broccoli soup & Yukon potato puree were very delicious. My sister loved her salmon. The carrot cake dessert was so-so, but really, by that time we were quite full and satisfied. However, where Club A really excelled was the service. Seriously, I don't remember the last time I was treated so nicely and well in a NYC restaurant. Initially they sat us down at a table that was not in a good location -- middle of the flow of traffic on both sides. When I told them that it really wasn't acceptable, they nearly fell over themselves to put us at a different table. Then, both the owner and maitre d' came up to us later to apologize and ask how things were. I can't express how rare that sort of attention is and how much it buys my loyalty. You need to really love red because the place is suffused with it, but the decor and lighting are understated.

4.0,7/23/2010,"I made a last minute reservation via OpenTable for Restaurant Week at Club A since hubby got off work early.  The area is horrible in terms of parking since it's right by the Queensborough Bridge and within proximity to the UN so a lot of streets are marked ""Diplomats Only"".  Hubby found parking after 20 minutes of searching 6 blocks over, so not a huge problem.The restaurant is not flashy, as in, you can't really see it from a block away.  It has a red awning, but no apparent signage telling you that they are who they are.  It is dimly lit in the way that some steakhouses are and I can totally see people going here for a special date night.  There is a small bar as you walk in and as it was a Thursday, plenty of happy hour white collar types enjoying their night.We were greeted warmly and led upstairs.  We sat right next to the piano and good thing no one was playing because I doubt I would've enjoyed the seat if that was the case.  Their second floor is quite beautiful as there is a huge window overlooking 58th Street and plush seating.  They even upholstered the ceiling in a dark red fabric in an asymmetrical pattern that might look tacky elsewhere but I thought it was just right.We were given the menus, but no drinks menu, so I asked for it from the busboy who filled our water glasses.  None came and even when the waitress came by to ask us what we wanted to drink she didn't notice it.  My husband stuck to the usual Heineken.   After about 10 minutes and after taking our orders, we were asked again if we'd like anything to drink by a separate waiter.  There is just too much disorganization in terms of waitstaff here and no one seems to know what's going on and there is no communication.  This is where they lost a star with me because I was a bit disappointed since everyone raved about their service.  However, this was the last of the neglectful service so I guess I can somewhat forgive them for it.We ordered the fried calimari, steak tartare, 10 oz filet, trout and potatoes & creamed spinach for the sides.  The food was full portioned so there was no need to get anything extra.  And seriously, where have you ever seen 10 oz steaks offered on the RW menu?  AND sides?  Absolutely unheard of!  Not only that but the food was actually very good.  Quantity + quality.  The calimari was crispy and not oily, the tartare was fresh and tangy, the filet was perfect at the requested medium rare and my trout was melt-in-your-mouth.  I wish I wasn't so full that I couldn't finish my trout but they had to clear away about 1/3 of it.  Hubby could only finish about 2/3 of his meal as well.We finished with tiramisu and cream puffs, which were slightly disappointing but at that point we didn't really mind all that much since we were full to the brim.The waitstaff would come by and check up on us every once in awhile but since we were fast eaters, it didn't bother us much, although this can seem intrusive/annoying to others.  We were in and out of there within 40 minutes, which is basically our MO.As an addendum, I can absolutely see the second floor being rented for engagement/bridal events.  It's a gorgeous space and the setup is perfect.",2,0,1,Annie H.,"Floral Park, NY",104,503,87

5.0,7/18/2010,"BY FAR the most amazing dinner ever. We had such a memorable night at Club A Steakhouse last night. We went there specifically for their restaurant week menu. Here is the rundown. -Fried Calamari: wonderful! The tomato dipping sauce was so tasty! -10 oz. Fillet: are you kidding me!?? on the RW menu? I would expect maybe 6 or 8 oz., no, 10 oz. of the most wonderful meat ever. My husband and I both like our steaks medium and they were perfect! I felt like mine was borderline medium rare but it was great! I can't wait to eat the leftovers today! -Spinach and Potatoes: Good. I wasn't blown away or anything, but I wasn't really there for the sides. I was there for the meat. :) -Carrot cake and cream puffs: Both were good but at this point we had stuffed ourselves to the point where we could only take a couple bites. ....and yes there is more. Drinks on the house after dinner! What?! Uhm, the only time we have ever received anything on the house was after a mistake was made by the kitchen. Absolutely blown away by the owner. Such a nice friendly person. He showed us around the upstairs and just talked to us for a while. There was no rushing us out the door and telling us to come back soon. Just nice conversation. The upstairs is beautiful. There was a singer in the corner playing the piano that gave it a very romantic feel.  But would also be a great place for dinner with a group of friends and/or company dinners. Thank you Club A - we loved the food and had a great time!",2,0,0,Lindsey S.,"Leawood, KS",16,152,82
5.0,7/13/2010,I went here for Restaurant Week last night and was so impressed I have already booked to go again before Restaurant Reek is over! The service is great! The filet mignon was tender and full of great flavor. The sauce for the calamari appetizer was delicious with a slight bite. My favorite dessert on the Restaurant Week menu is the cream puffs! You have to give this place a try!,0,0,0,Shane A.,"Long Island City, NY",0,1,0
4.0,7/8/2010,"Had a fantastic time at Club A Steakhouse. The waiting staff are courteous and attentive without at all being 'in your face'.On a hot day, we opted to go for an entree each in our group of three, the 3 sides for $24 and a bottle of red wine.Between us, we ordered a 24oz Rib Eye steak, Triple Colorado Lamb Chops and Blackened Swordfish. The reviews of all three dishes were exemplary.The only reason for 4 stars rather than 5, was that the side dissappointed slightly. The creamed spinach was a little too creamy, and hence lost a little flavour, the herbed garlic fries were a little dry (possibly a godd thing) but also lacked flavour. Had they been sold as regulary french fries, they might have received a better review. The truffled mac was too saucy and didn't really have a truffle flavour. The best truffled Mac I've had so far was at Spitzer's in the LES, so that should be the target at least for these guys.The wine list offered plenty of choice and even though we went for the cheapest bottle of Merlot, it wa very easy to drink and complimented the meal perfectly.On top of that, we went on a quiet night and the owners were extremely friendly and interesting to talk to.",1,0,0,Vikash R.,"New York, NY",24,12,11
5.0,6/4/2010,"Me and my girlfriend were looking for a good place to eat steak after visiting the MoMa and came upon this beautiful little restaurant.  The front bar was full of suits that just finished work. Honestly I felt I was out of place in my shorts and sneakers until a man who I thought was part of the suits came to assist us. After that, everything was ace. The service was perfect. I ordered a Filet Mignon cooked perfectly. My girlfriend ordered the Seafood Feast and was pleasantly surprised to have ""real"" cocktail sauce. To top it off we had for dessert the Chocolate Mousse cake.  It was a beautiful experience. Best part, after the dinner, me and my girlfriend needed a cab to go to the Cirque du Soliel show.  The man in the suit came out, walked down the street and helped us find a cab and gave us directions to the show. I highly recommend this place if you're in the area, or not.",0,0,0,Luke V.,"Brooklyn, NY",82,4,6

5.0,3/9/2010,"I was deciding between 4-5 stars and the free drinks at the end of dinner put Club A Steakhouse over the top.We were referred to Club A Steakhouse from a friend living in the area. We went here the night NYC was supposed to get 20-30 inches of snow and ended up with 0 inches, so the restaurant was pretty empty. We both got the 16 OZ! Filet Mignon which was enormous and equally delicious. It was tastefully seared on the outside warm and red on the inside, Perfect! 5 Stars for the Filet. We heard that the upstairs seating was really great but that section was closed because of the fake storm. Request to sit up stairs if you make a reservation.They have a good deal for sides 3 for $24 which were all pretty good, but not amazing.The service was also excellent. I assume that we got over the top service since the restaurant was empty but I will take it. 5 stars. Definitely check out Club A Steakhouse the next time you are in NYC.",0,0,0,Nate R.,"North Andover, MA",19,114,1
5.0,2/5/2010,"I just had dinner at this amazing establishment for the first time.  My boyfriend took me out on an amazing anniversary dinner last riday night.  We walked in to a beautifully decorated red themed bar area with a super friendly bartender and referred us to their amazing wine list.  When we sat for dinner we could hear the live music (piano player) playing through the duration of the dinner which highlights included escargot and the Porterhouse for 2.  Everyone from the waitstaff to hostess were kind and hospitable.  Also, we got to meet the proprietor himself...Bruno who has owned the establishment since the '80 (there were loads of pictures with him and many famous people that obviously had graced the establishment for years).  Long story short this is a place that you must check out...with your mate, with your clients, with whomever.  Its worth it.  I also noticed that there is a private room upstairs which would work well for a company meeting or wedding rehearsal dinner and could probably sit 30-40 people.",1,0,0,Amy S.,"New York, NY",27,3,0
4.0,1/22/2010,"After much research all over the net and calls to many people, I decided on Club A steakhouse for my birthday dinner. We were a group of 8, we all love a good steak (Peter Lugers, BLT, Porterhouse, Prime, craftsteak, strip house, uncle jacks - we have all eaten in many steakhouses) and we all enjoyed the food, the atmosphere, which was cozy and not loud, and the service. I would def put club A right up there with the best of them! We ate porterhouse steaks, filet mignon, Chilean sea bass, shrimp cocktails, onion soups, crab cakes, mac n cheese, creamed spinach and french fries. We had one minor complaint, the crab cake, which was just OK. Everything else was fab! We enjoyed so much that I convinced a friend to change her reservation with her boyfriend for the following evening from BLT Prime to Club A. I will def be back!",0,0,0,Kaity S.,"Astoria, NY",16,19,4
5.0,1/15/2010,"I love Club A. I've been there several times before both with a group of friends (5) and on a date. I've always walked out with a big smile on my face. Finally I decided to write a well deserved review on a quality restaurant.The last time I went there was in the end of Dec.  Some things I like about the place are,the food is excellent, the atmosphere is sexy, but not overly done, I would feel comfortable having client dinners here, the wait staff is attentive and professional. Bruno the owner visited the table to see how things were, actually bought us a round of drinks after a short friendly conversation. He seems to be a kind man who takes great pride in his business.  We were never rushed throughout the night. After dinner and dessert headed upstairs to listen to the live music (piano) and have a few more cocktails.  All I can say is if you need a sure thing for a special night Club A  is the place.",0,0,0,Brian B.,"New York, NY",5,19,3

5.0,7/29/2009,"Hmmm...what to say that doesn't just parrot previous reviewers?.....After a disappointing steak last night, I was looking for redemption and found it. In most other cities, Club A would be hoofs-down the best steak joint in town; here in NYC it is one among many, but it still deserves 5 stars.I normally prefer a more full-flavored cut like a bone-in ribeye, but they were all very LARGE steaks so I went with the smaller filet.  And onion soup.  And creamed spinach.The onion soup was very good, made with gruyere.  Creamed spinach was exactly like it should be -- a little onion, a little garlic, nice creamy sauce, not cooked to death.The steak was *extremely* good --- of course cooked perfectly, brought out reasonably quickly, with such a flavorful, crispy outside that I didn't even use the bordelaise sauce I asked for on the side.  Not the best steak I've ever had, but right up there......Service & whatnot:  I sat at the bar as I ate alone, several other guys were there after work.  Most wore suits.   A couple of locals (ie, lived on the same block) were dressed very casually like me, we didn't feel like second-class citizens.  Service was good... attentive but not too chatty, and paced very nicely.  Prompt, not with a rush, but didn't keep me waiting.  A glass of wine, soup, side and steak were $88.As another review said....there are lots of other places to try before repeating Club A, but if you haven't been yet it's definitely worth a try!",2,0,0,Jeff K.,"Longmont, CO",62,64,2
4.0,5/15/2009,"I love steak, and even though I've lived just a few blocks away from Club A Steakhouse for years, I had my first dining experience just the other night.  The restaurant is kind of hidden on 58th Street between 2nd and 3rd Avenue (closer to 2nd).  It has a distinctly Russian feel to it, lots of red walls, a roaring fireplace even on warm nights, a small comfortable dining room just three steps away from a small bar area.  I shared the Escargot appetizer, which was very good; the snails were already deshelled and dripping with butter.  For my entree, I opted for the Filet Mignon ($42) which was prepared perfectly, and the portion size was so large that I couldn't even finish it.  For the sides, I shared the HashBrowns (good but not great), the Broccoli (amazing...served in a garlic sauce), and the Truffle Macaroni and Cheese (took my breath away...I could eat this dish every day for the rest of my life). At the end of the meal, even though my friend and I did not order dessert, we were served a bowl full of fresh green grapes.  The perfect sweet treat.  My experience at Club A Steakhouse was very good though it doesn't top the best steak I've ever had, which is from Delmonico's.  And there are still so many steakhouses in NY to visit before I'd return to Club A.",4,2,2,Krista J.,"Brooklyn, NY",749,1181,35
