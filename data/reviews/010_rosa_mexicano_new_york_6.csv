1.0,4/29/2019,"Not gonna lie, I'm so disappointed. The service was non existent. Even when you manage to get a hold of someone and ask for small things like straws, salt, to order a second round of drinks- they say ok and then never comes back with anything. It's a Monday night, it's not even busy, just a couple tables which makes me wonder what all the staffs are doing. The food is another story. Under seasoned fish tacos with not even a speck of salt, the churros were cold and a week old, the corn that was uncobbed served with the meal included chopped up pieces of the core - it's like eating pomegranate where you have to chew it and then spit the rest out. I totally get and understand expensive manhattan food, even expensive manhattan average food. But this, this is lazy and the negligence is unacceptable.I couldn't take any pics of the food because the lighting is blue at night and you can't see any color of your food (so you can't tell if it's fresh) other than blue. What I could see is the black specks of dirt or whatever the black specks are in my cucumber drink.",0,0,0,Florence V.,"Dyker Heights, NY",116,71,292
4.0,4/22/2019,"I love Rosa as do my kids. The restaurant is spacious and doesn't feel like you are almost sitting in your neighbor's lap and listening to their conversations. They have the best margaritas and guacamole, their suizas are delicious, my kids love their quesadillas, and their corn side is so good. They used to have esquites which they don't have anymore but will make it if you request it. The Mexican hot chocolate is also good, and their churros are yummy, fresh and hot! Love this restaurant. Reservations highly recommended. Their East side location is also pretty good and easier to get reservations for.",0,0,0,Pearl M.,"New York, NY",48,199,29
1.0,4/19/2019,"WORST. DINING. EXPERIENCE. EVER. Actually barely a dining experience. If I could give zero stars I would. We waited almost an hour to be seated despite having a reservation for a Passover dinner. This with several groups being seated ahead of us due to ""reservation glitches."" The manager compd one drink each and one app, so we thought maybe things would get back on track. NOPE. It took 45 minutes for the waiter to take our order. At that point we were told NONE of the passover entrees were available despite it being noted in our reservation that's what we were coming for.  90 mins after we entered we walked out with no food and will never come again.

5.0,4/19/2019,"I had a wonderful Passover dinner at Rosa Mexicano on 62nd and Columbus with my mother and aunt. The food is always great, but the management and staff at Lincoln Center truly went above and beyond tonight. The restaurant was very busy and it both took a while to order after everyone came and the entree took a little longer than normal. It wasn't the type of thing that we would have even complained about. However, the manager saw us waiting and saw us looking unhappy about something completely unrelated to the service and gave us two desserts, a date cake and tres leches. This was the first holiday since my father passed. The wonderful food and service truly made a difference for us.",0,0,0,Ron L.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,1,0

3.0,3/31/2019,TL;DR Food is outstanding except one dish. Ignore the hostess she's having a bad day. Hostess was frigid.  No smile. No welcome.  Didn't say anything and walked away after getting our name for the reservation.  Came back to seat us a few minutes later with the same icy stare.  Server was friendly and accommodating. Food was great with the exception of one dish ROLLO DE PECHUGA.  The chicken was so dry and over cooked.   The only part of the dish that was good was the poblano creama; it was subtle and incredible.  Guacamole is always SO good.  PESCADO PRIMAVERA Was delicious.,1,0,1,Kere W.,"Manhattan, NY",0,37,34

2.0,3/19/2019,"I've been coming here since this location first opened and have watched it sadly decline over the years. Mostly the service was careless, but the food remained delicious. But our last visit a few weeks ago was just terrible -- food and service. We were ignored for about 10 minutes after being seated before someone came over. We were not greeted, we weren't even sure if this man was our waiter because all he said was ""Do you want guacamole?"" We said yes because it's the best and asked for it extra spicy. We also placed an order for nachos and drinks. About 15 more minutes passed before our guacamole was made (still no drinks in sight). Obviously there was no communication between our ""waiter"" and the server who prepared our guacamole because it was super bland. Next our drinks arrived (the margaritas were watery). We had to ask if we could order our entrees. Were there specials? Who knows?! Our nachos came shortly after our drinks. We were still working on our guacamole and nachos, barely into them, when suddenly our entrees appeared. Our appetizers were removed (didn't even ask if we were done) and our dinner placed before us. Maybe I'm a weirdo, but I like the table cleared between courses and 5 -10 minutes to digest. I also like to finish the food I ordered at my own pace. Well so far the food was OK, but the entrees were terrible. I ordered the Enchiladas Suizas. The tortillas were like cardboard and the meat tasted sweaty. I did order a side of plantains I really enjoyed and that was all I ate; it's also all my husband ate. He ordered the beef tacos and he stopped on the first taco and looked at me funny because he bit into something that tasted and felt ""really not right"". After the weird burst of activity with our food, we were then ignored forever, both anxious to get out of there. I don't think I will visit this particular location again which is a bummer because it's close to home. Oh well, we had a good run.",2,0,0,Austen C.,"New York, NY",0,4,0

3.0,2/26/2019,"Rosa Mexicano is a decent place; their food is of good quality and their cocktails are fine, but it's definitely overpriced.

1.0,2/8/2019,"Worst Restaurant Experience in over 40 Years of Dining in NYC!!!I wished I could give a negative star.The worst thing was having gone there in the first place, and we did it knowing better, and only because we were entertaining friends from Canada who somehow wanted to go there (and it is close to our house). Rosa Mexicano - the original one on the East Side - was once a truly great restaurant but that was decades ago. Since then it has become a kind of chain restaurant with many location all of which have the same formula. (Olive Garden, anyone?)I had made a reservation online requesting a QUIET table for 4. When we got there, trying to go to the upstairs section to get away from the bar, we were told it was closed for a private function, and they shunted us to a downstairs table for 6 or 8, far too large for 4 people trying to have an intimate dinner. Moreover the downstairs noise/""music""  was deafening. We asked the waiter to turn it down and they did. We only stayed because it was pouring rain outside.  We ordered drinks, and then food. Right then a group of about a dozen inebriated people with party hats walked in and set down at a table reserved for them. They put on the worst sh-t show I have ever seen in any restaurant. Banging fists on the table and singing drunken songs the whole time. Then a couple of them got up, stamped their feet, hopped around the table like apes while scratching their genitals and grunting while they were being filmed by one member of their clan and cheered on by the rest of the frat boys. Everybody else in the room was horrified, and people started to complain. We called for the manager who promptly came over. When I asked her how they dared to allow this kind of thing to happen at the expense of all the other guests, she just shrugged her shoulders and said she was sorry and that she had been hoping ""they would calm down"". He she admitted they were regulars who came there all the time. She told us we did no have to pay for our (rather mediocre) dinner. The worst thing about this experience, apart from our ruined evening, was that this group of frat boys (and girls) was obviously more important to their business than the rest of the diners. So why not pick up all the other guest checks so that this group could go on with their obnoxious alcoholic (I have to say it again) sh-t show, and come back for more in the future?No one could pay me enough to go back there.",1,0,0,Beate E.,"Manhattan, NY",0,7,0
3.0,2/7/2019,"I must admit that the interior is great and our waitress is very nice. Always checking up on us and always smiling but the food is not good, Its okay. We went for a saturday night dinner and wow, lots of people is waiting. Theirs 5 of us and wr got seated right away because one of my friend made a reservation. We ordered margarita for drinks and it was pretty strong, maybe because I dont really drink. For appetizers we ordered chips and guacamoke and it has chunky avocado because they made it on the spot close to our table. They really have this guacamole guy who constantly making it so its fresh. We also got the shrimp civeche. This is okay, not so tasty. I've tried civeche before and I had a good one better than this. For food we got 4 types and we shared it.  We got hongos, its all vegestable like mushroom, black beans, yellor peppers and corn for our vegetarian friend. We also had carnitas, its pork with cilantros, grilled pineapple and a lot more. All their food is okay and not the food you will crave. This is not a place to hang out or catch up with friends. I feel kinda uncomfortable when the manager went to our table and said do you guys need anything? Coz we have lots of reservation for tonight.

3.0,1/12/2019,"Made a reservation for 2 here for 5:30 pm on a Saturday night, and we were led to our table upstairs just a couple of minutes after our arrival. All seemed fine so far; we were given menus. We sat for about 10 minutes when a waiter came over and asked if we wanted a drink from the bar. We didn't at this time, just asked for water. That was a mistake, because we did not see him again for about 20 minutes afterwards. We got the water and some chips, but no one took our food order.The waiter who asked for our drink order never told us his name, so we asked another waiter who was helping customers sitting in front and next to us who our waiter was and could he help us please. Weird that our table was not part of that server's section, who had tables all around us. This waiter was cordial enough and said he'd get our server. My husband watched him go over to the person who'd first ask if we wanted drinks; apparently this was our waiter, who was leaning against a wall in the back. Some words were quickly exchanged that we couldn't hear. Yet our server still did not not come over to us for another 15 minutes or so; no apology, no excuse when he finally did. Our menus had clearly been face down on the table for a good 20 minutes and we were looking all around for him. Now it's nearly 30 minutes into sitting at a table with just water, chips and menus in front of us while everyone else was getting their guac and appetizers. I was just happy that he finally came to take our order, and didn't want to rock the boat by asking what took so long.The food we finally got tasted good, but I was so annoyed at being ignored for no good reason that I could barely enjoy it. We had a show to make and had plenty of time, as I made the reservation for 2 hours before showtime, and still we barely made the curtain with 15 mins. to spare. If the kitchen is moving slowly, let me know. If you're overwhelmed with too many customers, explain yourself. Don't just make customers sit there. Granted we weren't ready to order after just being seating; that doesn't mean you punish us and make us wait 20 minutes before showing your face again.

The original location stands out and I want to go back there to see if they have maintained the quality since it is a much smaller venue.That said, all of the other (large) locations are sub-standard and certainly not worth the price! This was last night at Lincoln Center - The margaritas were good albeit not much tequila. We order the guac, which they always make table-side, except this time. We got a bowl that was so salty (and I love salt) that we sent it back. The chicken in the fajitas was bland and overdone, the tacos were tasteless and not worth eating, and the rice was beyond ""al dente"" or maybe just cold. The black beans were good. The enchilada suizas were lifeless. Nothing was hot except the plate on which the enchiladas were served. The food was unimpressive in the Flatiron District as well.

The ambiance was also nice- upscale yet relaxed. Overall we thought this was a solid choice for quality food, drinks, and experience. We also saw many families, couples, and business groups at the restaurant.

We got to the restaurant on time (even checked in early), but they had no table for us.  After a 20+ minute wait we were given a dark narrow table in the back up against a wall (not a nice location); we had no choice but to take it.  After ordering, they got one of our drink orders wrong, and one of our entrees wasn't delivered (apparently they forgot to put the order in); it came to the table 5 minutes before we had to leave.  Everything was rushed, and at the end there was no time for coffee/dessert.  Not what I expected, and not a great experience.

4.0,11/25/2018,"So much to love about this restaurant. Beautiful ambiance and water features when you first walk in leave a great first impression. Ample seating room means you will almost always get a table. Carefully chosen one-page menu of Mexican food that's sure to satisfy you, and the other page is full of some crowd-pleasing drinks. The service is very good, prompt and friendly and what you'd expect at a more high end (read expensive) venue. Price is usually cheaper than what you'd expect for the product. All in all I give it a solid A.For appetizers, you've got to get the guacamole, prepared table side in a mochajete. We got ours spicy. There were some minor execution flaws (missing salt and some of the chips were burnt), but otherwise very solid. Most tables in the restaurant had guacamole on them. We also got the queso, but as a perveyor of Mexican fast food (which is more creamy), I felt Rosa's queso was very very stringy. They served it with burritos, but I was confused. Isn't queso prepared with chips? In any case it was fun to try and eat without the cheese following us to our plates. For mains, we are pescetarian, so had the fish tacos and the grilled vegetables (cauliflower cooked in achiote). Both were great, but the fish could have used some extra crunch, maybe with a different type of batter (ie tempura). Drinks were awesome. They do a great frozen Margherita with all types of flavors. For dessert, highly recommend the churros. SAVE ROOM!In terms of value, seems that you'll always end up spending around $100 for two people, which for this is a very good value.

2.0,11/10/2018,"I've been dining here pre Lincoln Center since the restaurant opened 18 years ago but after this evening, I don't think I'll return. We had an Opentable reservation made a week in advance for 6pm. When we arrived at 6pm, we were told it would be a few minutes. 5 Minutes later we were told that the only table available was on the ground floor or it would be a long wait.  I quickly went to my Opentable App on my iphone and saw that 6pm, 6:15pm and 6:30 pm were available for parties of two. So, the host and hostess were telling me that the ONLY table available was on the ground floor despite the fact that they were still accepting reservations for the time we arrived? Having to attend a concert at Lincoln Center we agreed to accept the table. First off, our server was fine. He was overwhelmed with the number of tables that he was assigned to but was attentive. Our appetizers were the Ensalada Caesar Mexicana and the Empanadas de Pollo con Chorizo. Our entrees were the Rollo de Pechuga and the Pescado Primavera. The Caesar Salad was good but nothing special. The Epanandas were OK The Rollo de Pechuga tasted like a dish that if the executive chef had created it would have been amazing. But it fell flat. The Pescado Primavera was cold. Dessert was the chocolate cake which was good.. Coffee was good, Decaf was mediocre and overpriced at $4.00.

The prices are right, the drinks are not watered down, the food is much better than the other Rosa Mexicanos, the location is easy for people to get to and I realized I ALWAYS get the same waiter:Napoleon.First, I will say - The fried fish tacos are my go-to yumminess (yes, that IS a word)Second.. The ""Street style corn"" side dish IS MY LYFEUH! (also a word). Each time I have it, I go (Mentally) back to Chicago when you could find corn on a stick being sold at any freakin corner. I appreciate the fact Rosa  roasts the corn to give it a perfectly charred yet smooth and spicy flavor. I could swim in that freakin sauce. Finally, and most importantly, NAPOLEON! I realized last night, I have always had him as a waiter! His service needs to be recognized in this review because his timing and hospitality are spot THE FREAK ON! He is very attentive without being overbearing, has great suggestions with drinks (importante), and his explanations/knowledge of dishes are extraordinary. When you have served before (like many of us) really good waitstaff sticks out, and I would have to say that his talents not only makes Rosa Mexicano look good, but he makes ME look good when I take my friends out to eat.

The entrees are also massive.  For the quesadilla, the appetizer size is 4 full slices and the entree size is 8 full slices, so if you're asked whether you want the appetiser size of any dish or the entree size, know that the appetiser size is plenty, but if you're feeling really hungry, feel free to eat the entree the size of Australia.  Also, they bring out beans and rice for the table, so between that and the chips and guac that you definitely ordered, it's a lot of food.I ordered the hongos tacos, which was also super filling because it came with 3 tacos and some corn on the side.  And top tip: order the spicy salsa on the side because unless you can handle your spice really well (and I mean really well) you're gonna end up sobbing at the table and drinking so much water.Best part, our food arrived at 7.10pm and our show started at 7.30pm and we made it in time thanks to the fast service! 10/10",0,0,1,Jiwon K.,"Sheffield, United Kingdom",75,19,29

The hostesses, the service, the food; absolutely delectable. I can't wait to tell everyone that I know to go have an experience here. We even meet the General Manager, Amedeo, and that was really the icing on the cake. You could tell from speaking with him that he was genuine and truly cared about  the guest experience.

3.0,2/7/2018,"At Lincoln Center, even middle of the road chain restaurants like Rosa Mexicano sport a branded trash can street side.  A subtle hint perhaps that you are about to enter a pricey joint that -- regrettably -- serves only average food.They mix a killer Mojito here and the guacamole made tableside is full of flavor -- as are the light and crispy tortilla chips. Can't say the same about the rest of our meal.The salsa served with the chips tasted flat -- like it was poured from a jar that had been sitting in the walk in for a very long time. We ordered fish (Baja) and Tinga (short rib) tacos. The tacos themselves were soggy and tasteless -- and the filling in both versions was very average -- even mushy. Both were bland and screamed for some sort of textural counterpoint. The shrimp ceviche consisted of about 4 shrimp, some cukes and onions with diced jicama -- in a pleasant citrus base. Like the other dishes we ordered, the shrimp were tasteless and on balance -- the dish did not read like ceviche -- more like a shrimp cocktail.We finished with Churros -- served in a pink bag that was shaken tableside by the server -- to coat them in the cinnamon/sugar coating -- then presented in a plate with decent chocolate and raspberry syrup. The churros were crispy outside but partially raw inside -- not the best version of this dessert I've eaten. Our tab for two with drinks (we each had a mojito) plus tip came to $160.  Considering what we ate -- this meal seriously underwhelmed.Top Tip:  perimeter seating on the second floor with a view of Lincoln Center is very pleasant and is a nice perch for drinks, snacks and people watching.",7,3,6,Yuri Y.,"Ridgewood, NJ",449,440,1563

My entree, the carnitas, was much too salty, so that I could take only a few bites and my favorite dessert, the tres leches, was different from how it used to be.

Their chicken like fajitas is a huge portion and people really enjoyed it. The carnitas was another huge portion and very good.The desserts we tried were ice cream sandwich which was excellent, the taco which was pleasing, and the coke float with Mexican coke different taste than standard and worth trying.

2.0,9/5/2017,I really wanted to like Rosa Mexicano but it failed to deliver. The spicy guacamole was good but the chips served weren't warm (but advertised as warm). I had the vegetarian Al Carbon. This was the single most disappointing thing I've had in a restaurant in a long long time. Nothing was warm (I usually associate these to be hot and steaming). The cauliflower was uninspired with absolutely no flavor and tasted like raw cauliflower. There was copious amounts of bitter kale which also lacked in flavor. The tortillas were served in a box meant to keep them warm but the box was superfluous since nothing was warm! There were some roasted peppers and rice/beans that were alright and saved me from going home hungry.

2.0,8/23/2017,"My friend and I were looking for something relatively casual in the area and this was perfect. The actual restaurant is really cute and the food ended up being great for the most part but my reason for 2 stars is because our service was horrible. Each table receives complimentary chips & salsa - our table however was skipped and it wasn't even that busy (it was a Tuesday night). We had to ask a runner to grab one for us 15 mins after being sat. And the salsa was so bland. Additionally, when we were ordering, we asked our server for a small side of guac to go along with our quesadillas. He explained that the only way to get a ""side"" of guac is by ordering the $15 appetizer. When my friend ran to the bathroom, she stopped at the host stand to ask for the side of guac and was told that they can indeed provide the guac for $3.50! It's a silly complaint but the servers need to get their facts right (unless they were tying to weasel us to spend more).

I had called around 12pm and spoke with a gentleman that took my reservation over the phone since OpenTable was currently not working. I called to change my reservation from 7 to 730 hey couldn't find my reservation and after a few minutes on hold they found it and did the change. When we get to the restaurant this very unprofessional hostess manager, began giving me attitude because I approached her and said I had a reservation of 5 people at 730. "" you have no reservation, there's nothing in our system you'll  have to go else where"" not even mad upset at what she said but her entire character and attitude. I said I called earlier made a reservation, called again to change the time and they were able to find it, she said well I you didn't make a reservation here and at this point she was speaking very loud and others heard the way she spoke and stared at her. Then magic happened and boom after all her attitude and stank face she found my reservation, didn't apologies at all when she unfortunately was the one at wrong and although she claimed to be a manager didn't know how to work the system to find a reservation that was there. Very disappointed and won't be coming back . For a big name restaurant I believe a manager should have the proper communication skills when it comes to dealing with customers and shouldn't have an attitude when dealing with one especially when they are wrong, in which she was cause my reservation was there. Very poor service on her end and with her managing a big business that has to do a lot with customer service . I'm a manager at a high end restaurant on the upper east side and when a customer claims to have a reservation and we don't find it, our first priority becomes them and what we tell them is we'll do everything possible to accommodate them and to just give us a couple of mintues.

The guacamole would be better with some citrus, but even without it was still tasty. I got the Mexican Caesar, which was a disappointment and the carnitas, which was fine. I prefer my carnitas quite crispy, but it did have decent flavor. Cadillac margarita was a bit of a let down, but I still managed to drink it all.

It came as a positive surprise after a whole day walk next to less appealing places. We ordered guacamole as a starter and I have to say it was one of the best I ever had! However, this is where I draw the line with the ""wow"" factor. My husband and I were a bit disappointed with our main dishes as guacamole raised our expectations pretty high :) He ordered Fish tacos Plancha and I ordered Flautas de Pollo. Flautas were assorted with rice and bean mash. There were many ingredients in both of our dishes. The food was presented nicely and was of good quality...

The bartender at this area was not that attentive but he did recommend a house favorite (pomegranate maragarita). The drink was good. We came there a bit hungry and waiting almost an Hr at the bar one of the people I was with decided to order a nacho appetizer which took about 20 mins to come and when it arrived needed to be sent back because it wasn't given the way she ordered it minus whatever she was allergic to.We finally got seated and the waiter was vigilant in taking our orders and making sure we were set on drinks. Ample menu, many options. Now guys, I LOVE Mexican food but this place had so many options. We all ordered something different and each order for the most part came with a side on rice and a side of refried beans. The rice was soooooo dry. I tried to like it, I really did but my taste buds didn't allow me to and the refried beans was salty but pairing it with the dry rice made it manageable to eat. Meats were all tasty ESP the shrimp over spicy green sauce and the chicken was slightly dry but not anything to complain about. Edible for sure.

1.0,4/8/2017,"Very disappointing! We go to other Rosa Mexicano locations which are excellent, but this one was terrible. Ordered several dishes. Kids got they food about 30 minutes before our plates arrived. The beans were totally salty (also confirmed by my wife), so it was not my taste buds. I ordered my skirt steak medium and got charcoaled steak that was far from medium well. I told the waiter, who was friendly and accommodating and he then brought me a decently cooked steak. The manger came at some point to our table next to the entrance, even though there were several better tables upstairs available, which was another joke. When I pointed that out, I was given a ridiculous explanation.   At some point the manager showed up in a snooty tone, who wanted to pay for my steak, which I gracefully declined. My 5 and 7 year old daughters ordered taco plates and left everything. That's how much they liked it. We will not be back, even though we live close by. Very disappointing lunch and a total waste of money. Avoid this location if you can!

I've had great dishes here in the past off their regular menu many times in the past (I usually go for the arrachera) but the carnitas really turned me off.

Love guac though so I didn't mind.Fish tacos - comes with three tacos and a side dish of creamy corn. The tacos were tasty. Fish was grilled so it's light and contrasts well with the crunch of the cabbage. The creamed corn was buttery! Rice and beans - also complimentary for the table that's comes out with the entree. Pretty standard, nothing to write home about here.

3.0,1/3/2017,"Rosa Mexicano was all about the ambiance. It's showy, it's touristy, it's impressive to look at. Immediately upon entering you see a large staircase leading to the 2nd floor. Behind it is a sculpture with rows of divers. The top row shows the divers beginning the dive heads up and each progressive row show the divers arching downwards until the final dive position at the bottom. The guacamole presentation is also showy. A server wheels a cart loaded w/avocados, jalapenos, onions, tomatoes, cilantro, and salt to your table. He checks the spiciness level and then proceeds to make it while you watch. It was good guacamole, but again for $15 you are paying for the show. The staff were all gracious and dressed to the nines. Although most of the patrons were dressed casually, you would not have felt out-of-place dressing up.Regarding the food, the tortilla chips were very fragile and broke easily when dipping in the guacamole. The salsa was fresh, light, and easily my favorite dish besides the guacamole. We also had the suizas enchiladas which were chicken tinga in a tomatilla sauce with chihuahua cheese and the tres enchiladas which is one suiza, one mole and one mestiza enchilada. The mestiza was braised beef with queso fresco. The mole was chicken tinga covered in mole sauce. I was not a fan of any of these. The mole was particularly chocolaty which didn't suit my taste-buds. The entrees were served w/a family style serving of beans and rice. The beans were pasty and the rice bland despite it's red appearance indicating it would be spicy. In general I was very disappointed by the food. The prices for all of the dishes were considerably higher than I would expect for equivalent Mexican food.With so many great food options to choose from in NYC, I doubt I would return here.",1,0,0,Pat D.,"Madison, WI",58,248,8

Now let's talk about the food. Child, that food was delish. First of all,  the guacamole was freshly made in front of us. I've had better guacamole, but it was cool seeing someone make guac. The drinks were strong and all of the food was flavorful. Now, the desserts were good. The flan could have been better, but the tres leche was divine. First of all, the tres leche was huge. To be frank, it was as large as a brick (see my photo). So, it is certainly share worthy. It wasn't like the typical tres leche that is super sweet. No, the tres leche at Rosa Mexicano was sweet enough. Side note: I don't know about you, but I find it so hard to pronounce the restaurant's name in English.

One of the best things about this city is the cuisine. Unfortunately, it seriously lacks in the Mexican department. But, we do have Rosa's!

As I've dined here before (also the Flatiron location), I remember how pretty the décor was---there's a waterfall against the wall leading to the upstairs level.We decided to order appetizers but as we waited, the chips and salsa were set on the table.  In addition, we ordered the tableside guacamole which was delightful, chunky and made to perfection! I think I had an entire basket of chips to myself, that's how good they were.  To me, when I dine at a Mexican restaurant, perfect chips determine the fate of the rest of the meal. It's my thing and it's important to have good chips at a Mexican restaurant. Their salsa was also made to perfection with a good hint of spiciness as well as lots of other nice flavors going on.We also ordered one round of Margaritas and I chose the spicy cucumber which was extremely good but spicy, just what I was looking for. My friends went for the frozen pomegranate and they were equally pleased.For our ""main"" which was really an appetizer--most of us ordered the shrimp quesadilla. This was a generous 4 piece portion (quite filling for me after all the chips, salsa and guacamole) and really delicious--enough pieces of shrimp, spice and cheese all integrated very well with a side of pico de gallo and more guacamole!

I was running behind by quite, but was surprised that they hadn't even placed the orders when I got there (they had been sitting there for at least 30 minutes). We continued to wait and had to flag someone down to get our order. I was of course dying of thirst, and had to wait quite a bit before finding someone to bring us a bottle of water. I ordered the braised beef enchiladas and the table split the guacamole. The guac was tasty, and they make it right at the table which is cool. The enchiladas were a bit spicy, and hard to stomach in the state I was in. (I took it home as left overs and they were very tasty the next day when I was able to actually eat).Overall, this place was just meh.

We got on the wait list and waited 30 mins before we were called. Table had guacamole to start and sangria. Both were delicious. Sangria came with different fruits and cucumber (strange to see it but oddly good). Table ordered quesadilla, veggie tacos, and beef tacos. All served in a timely fashion and were seasoned well.

3.0,10/28/2016,"I consider myself a lover of all things Mexican so it was only a matter of time before I found myself at Rosa Mexicano because I have heard about it so many times but just never got a chance to dine. So its really huge and the décor is beautiful; especially the waterfall with the little men that look like they're diving. Ok.. so we were seated promptly and the service was great but I had a couple of gripes that I cant overlook. First of all, this restaurant is very overpriced especially for the portions. I was so taken aback by the size of the entrees.. they looked like samples -- for 25$ I expected a lot more. The empanadas that I got were about the size of cocktail patties and they didn't taste that great.The guacamole and the drinks are what I would come back for if I was ever in the area again because we devoured that guacamole like it was our last meal ... it was so good and flavorful and fresh because they have the guy come around and make it to your liking. My mouth is salivating right now just thinking about that--even the chips it came with were warm and fresh. The drinks were strong-- we got the mango margaritas and the first one was sooo good but the second one had way too much mango nectar in there. With all the Mexican options in the city I definitely wouldn't rush back here because it was just an OK experience besides that yummy guacamole.",4,1,2,Shari P.,"Hempstead, NY",758,225,2361
1.0,10/27/2016,"I had a terrible experience at this Rosa Mexicano about two weeks ago.  Having recently moved to the Upper West Side, this was my first time visiting this location and I don't plan to return. My friend and I went after work on a Thursday night and planned to order a few appetizers and enjoy some margaritas.  Unfortunately, we were completely ignored the entire time.  Our first round of drinks took 10-15 minutes to arrive (they arrived after the guacamole came out) and while we didn't complain or say anything, the waiter apologized and blamed a printing machine that ran out of paper for the delay.  Fast forward to our next round of drinks, the waiter just complete forgot - we ordered them, waited another 10-15 minutes then motioned for the waiter back over to the table and he apologized and admitted to just forgetting this time around.  He then offered us free bacon ice cream to make up for it (while we're in the middle of eating apps and on our second round of drinks - no thank you).  Margaritas were average at best and it was an all-around horrible dining experience, especially for the price you're paying.  I would recommend you find another Mexican restaurant in Manhattan - there's no shortage to choose from!",1,0,1,Kaitlyn K.,"New York, NY",161,11,6

The red sangria is a must. Last time I went I got the carnitas - definitely a must if you go. The tres leches is to die for!!! Seriously one of the best I've had from a restaurant. The guacamole is delicious and fresh. Service: service is friendly and attentive the only *little* complaint I have is that we were sitting at our table for 45 minutes after eating dessert to then wait on the bill and getting the credit cards back so we can leave.

2.0,9/29/2016,"My experience at this Rosa Mexicana was overall subpar. I felt this location was all about the decor and the experience and not about the food. The interior decor and ambiance was great. Spacious restaurant, lots of seating available upstairs and downstairs. Decor was modern, and with the lighting inside, at first, I thought I was in a lounge. My friends and I decided to eat in the dining room upstairs. For apps, we decided to share the fresh Guacamole made table-side. For entrees, we shared the Pollo Adobado which is basically Grilled strips of Chicken w/ slow-cooked peppers and Chihuahua Cheese, and I ordered a Tres Enchiladas, which, according to the menu was a trio of ""Rosa Mexicana's signature enchiladas."" And I decided to order a Mango Frozen Tropical Margarita as well. Table-side Guacamole was pretty good. Not the best I've had, but it was definitely fresh with a decent sized portion. Could've used a little more salt and lime juice in my opinion as it didn't have enough acidity. The star of the Pollo Adobado dish was not the chicken but the delicious, gooey cheese! Loll The chicken overall was overcooked. As far as the enchiladas go, I didn't expect the plate to be drenched in sauce. The inside of the enchiladas were bland and I definitely did not enjoy that dish. And the Mango Frozen Tropical Margarita was pre-made..No surprise there. It's too bad they couldn't make one from scratch because they have a great looking bar area. I definitely won't be back. This place is like a tourist trap.

1.0,9/10/2016,"I usually come here because it is convenient to something that I'm doing near Lincoln Center; the place serves average Mexican food and I have never considered writing a review of such an underwhelming place. Today's experience, however, warrants a review. The fresh guac took an hour to arrive, the beef tacos ordered by my partner were not only chewy, but one of those tacos may not have even contained beef (I'm thinking shoelace, but I didn't check the chef's shoes, so I cannot say that with certainty), the drinks were warm and watered down and the food that was edible was bland.  Furthermore, the restaurant wasn't crowded at all, but the waitstaff was incredibly neglectful and absent through the entire meal. The only extended exchange I had with any of them was when one bumped into me and then proceeded to hold onto my arm for a much longer than needed period of time while he apologized.",0,0,0,Dominique M.,"Williamsburg - North Side, Brooklyn, NY",0,1,1

Very tender and full of flavors chicken/layered tortillas/corn/cheese and a creamy sauce. My friends had the Mole Poblano $22.00 and the Polo Adobado $23.00.

We had to tell the server he forgot to wrap up the tortillas then when we get home, come to find out he never wrapped up the rice. The carnitas, the actual protein (pork) was bland.

We got 2 servings of the guacamole and the white sangria which were good. There were some avocado shells in our guacamole though.For me, it was just very average Mexican food. I got their steak fajitas. I think it's listed on the menu as tequila and lime marinated flank or skirt steak. The meat was very tender but it came out on a pool of congealed cheese which wasn't very appetizing. The veggies were very sparse. Rice and beans were served family style to the table. There is no dessert menu which I also did not like, even if it's just 3 items (churros, tres leches, and flan) it's still nice to get the menu so you can see the prices. We got one tres leches cake for the table to share and it was PLENTY for 4 people as it was, as expected, a very rich cake.",4,0,0,Huy H.,"Fairfax, VA",156,145,45
2.0,6/6/2016,"I've ordered from Rosa Mexicano a few times now and I can't say I've had any spectacular experiences with them. The food is really good, which is why I order. But their service and timeliness is horrible. This past instance was definitely the worst. I ordered my lunch over seamless at roughly 9:30 and scheduled the delivery for 11:30am. Once 11:30 came and passed and I had still not even received a confirmation email from them, I called and they let me know that they just opened at 11:30 so that' why. That, obviously isn't their fault - it's Seamless' for letting me order still. However, they said I would have it delivered in 30-40 minutes. Over an hour passes by and I have no delivery yet. So of course, I give them another ring. I was then placed on hold four different times and each time someone picked up the phone, I had to re-explain what was going on. Once I re-explained it the fourth time, the girl said, ""Oh yeah, that just went out but the delivery guy is taking other ones first."" And that was it. Terrible service and needless to say, I will not be ordering from them again.",0,0,0,Natasha G.,"New York, NY",299,13,0
3.0,6/6/2016,"Came here before a night at Lincoln Center. The decor and the professionalism of the staff are on fleek here. I just didn't think the fare reached those same heights. They make the guacamole tableside. Big deal, I do the same thing in my kitchen and mine is better. I got the fish tacos. They were tasty but meager. I was hungry again half way through the show. My two dinner companions, however, were blown away and raved about it. But they don't get out much and this is my review, not theirs. LOLI asked the guacamole guy why the restaurant is named Rosa MexicanO and not Rosa MexicanA, since Espanol requires gender agreement, but I didn't really understand his answer. I don't think he did either. I could see coming back once I hit lotto and sitting by one of the giant windows that overlook the street, people watching, enjoying the air conditioning and knocking back a few moderately expensive cocktails before a show.

1.0,5/4/2016,"Came here with a friend on a cold Wednesday night after shopping in the area. The hostess asked us if we had a reservation, which we did not, and told us that there was a minimum of 25 mins wait. We didn't want to wait because, you know, shopping makes people hungry. There was an empty small high table with two seats by the bar so we decided to take that spot instead of waiting for a ""real"" table. It was at an awkward angle. I was facing the back of the hostesses and the front door next to the guacamole station. My friend was facing the waterfall wall. I tried to remedy this and pulled the table over closer so that we would face each other. There was plenty of space for that. The hostess looked at us with what I can describe as a look of horror. And much too soon, the waiter came right over and pulled it right back out and said ""This table has to stay here because the bar is going to get full of people and need that space"".  Umm... really? At that moment, the bar still had some empty seats. My friend and I exchanged a ""that is weird"" look but decided to not let that ruin our night. We ordered the guacamole to start and while we were still looking at the menu, a second hostess asked us if we would like to seat at a table because they will have one cleared in just a few minutes. She told us we would have to first pay our bar bill before moving to the table. No problem. The guacamole came and we decided not to order until we sat at the other table. Minutes passed and still no word from the hostess. While people kept coming in and some had reservations, some didn't. They were all seated. I went up to the hostess, not the one that offered us the table as I didn't know where she disappeared to, and asked her about the table. She said we didn't put down our names so she had to give priority to the other people that were waiting. Oh, and that there would be another 20 mins wait. I should have argued that when we were offered the table, there wasn't any ""list"" because there weren't any people waiting. I would have been completely fine where I was but why make the offer and take it back?We finished the guacamole and our drinks and decided to go somewhere else.

The company dinner was fabulous! The catering/events manger was very professional and communicative and it all went off swimmingly. They had both vegetarian and vegan options and service was impeccable. 10 stars for that evening. I loved the dinner so much that I took my husband to Rosa's a couple of weeks ago before seeing an opera at Lincoln Center. It is crazy how different the service (and food) was on this occasion. Now granted, we sat in the bar area and the hostess was wonderful (she was able to find us a seat near the bar during dinner rush) but our waiter was horrendous. Not only did he wait on every table that came in long after we did, the ""bar menu"" does not offer anything vegan or vegetarian aside from guac. Knowing that they definitely do have veg options, when our waiter finally came to take our order, he was very perplexed by what we wanted. I requested the tacos  -- on the menu they were listed as having beans, corn, and rice with the option of adding various types of meat. I asked if we could get the tacos, but without the meat or dairy. Looking beyond confused, he asks, ""ummm, what exactly do you want in your taco then?"" and, once explained, he proceeds to bring out individual plates of soft tortillas, corn (covered in cheese), rice, and beans (sprinkled with cheese). I was sort of confused since the couple next to us received tacos fully assembled, but whatever we didn't mind doing it ourselves. What we did mind though was the fact our waiter did not bring us plates, napkins, or utensils, but did for all the tables around us. He also claimed that he ordered/brought out all the dishes separately to ""save us money""; however, our bill for all the taco ingredients added up to be $20, more than some of the tacos with meat.

I felt like I was in a resort restaurant- the decor was awesome and so calming, but also fun. We were seated immediately and the staff was SO kind. Our waiter came over right away with water, chips, and salsa (tey give you 2 or 3 salsas which were pretty spicy but had a smokey hint to them- awesome) and asked if we wanted drinks or guac- of course we said yes to both. Sangria was good, but definitley not strong. Maybe its because my friend and I look like were 12, but I can assure you we are both 22. They make the guac right at your table and in a HUGE bowl it was one of the best guacs Ive ever had and they give you flour tortillas with it. Genius.I got the shrimp tacos and they were.... unreal. The tortillas it came on were so soft and had crusted shrimps, kale, pickled onions and chiptole aioli. I took out the kale because I hate Kale and the onions were a little too pickled for my liking but nonetheless, it was a DOPE dish. It also came with a side of corn in this sauce that was basically heaven and I was very pleasantly surprised. They also brought out a side of beans and rice for the table- so many lovely surprises.We wanted dessert but couldnt settle so we asked if we could just get a brownie with 2 scoops of vanilla ice cream to share and they brought us out 2 individual brownies with a scoop on each PLUS little bowls of caramel and chocolate sauce.

My family and I went today to celebrate new year and took some relatives visiting from out of state. FOOD - The place should be  an embarrassment for chef/owner the food wasn't good at all. Cold rice and beans, the skirt steak had no taste. The shredded beef tacos were dried, and over salted. Chicken was dry, the sauces served with it didn't look fresh at all. The taco came with a small corn in the cob drenched in cheese and I what I think it was mayonnaise, who wants fat on their vegetables? The tortilla soup looked so dark, never seen it that way, my cousin didn't eat much of it. Pico de Gallo had green peppers, not very good or authentic. SERVICE- We were sat in large round table, it wasn't sturdy, a drink spilled because of it. (Table top had a cushion, not a flat service). What a ridiculous table for a restaurant.

It's not extraordinary, but it is great.Unfortunately we did not have dessert, so hopefully I'll be able to write another review later on.The reason this is not a 5-star review is that our waitress was not the most pleasant in the world.

I informed the manager (Ray, I was told by the hostess) at the start and several times along the way about what was happening with service, and he gave us the closest and most focused attention to correct our experience.

3.0,12/13/2015,"A buttoned down, pre theater kind of place where the way things are done and the service are as important as what you eat. The tableside guacamole makes you feel like a ridiculous human being as they roll out the guac station directly to your table. The drinks are a little weak, but good.The food was pretty nice. Obviously the guacamole was delicious, although I did find a piece of avocado skin that had gotten into it, no big deal though. My companion got the ropa vieja-ish enchiladas (forgot the name) and I had the chicken mole enchiladas. The mole sauce was excellent, one of the better ones I have had in NYC, but at $17 it better be good.Overall, I liked Rosa Mexicano, but it felt very similar to Fonda, which was a little less pretentious and a better value. I would rather go to Fonda instead of Rosa Mexicano, unless I explicitly had someone to impress. Maybe not coincidentally, the guy who runs Fonda was the culinary director for Rosa Mexicano for 5 years before startingn Fonda, so go figure.Note: They don't really have a brunch menu, they just open earlier for lunch on weekends.",0,0,0,Josh K.,"Jackson Heights, NY",295,1319,57

(Note, NOT ORDER, just ""have"" a round of tequila.) After a $200+ alcohol infused lunch, we assumed this was a ""thank you"" from the house for our business. Fortunately, only my husband said yes (to the first and second offer of a re-fill.). Imagine our surprise when the tab arrived with an $26 charge for the two drinks. (Thank goodness my sister and are are not tequila drinkers!) We paid the bill (and our lower tip reflected what we thought was a mis-representation on the waiter's part.)

If you haven't eaten at a taco shop or Mexican restaurant in SD, you're missing out! Put it on your bucket list! This place didn't taste like taco shop or traditional Mexican, but I enjoyed their light take on Mexican immensely! The food wasn't trying to authentic Mexican in my opinion, which is good! Because for whatever reason, no one outside of SoCal can ever seem to get that right! I thought it was a great tasting, kind of healthier version of what you could get in So Cal. I had a goat cheese chile rellano. I was expecting something more decadent originally, but was happy in the end that it was very light! I didn't leave feeling like a stuffed sausage!

I have to say the service has declined and it was not a pleasant experience. I ordered the flautas de pollo and the empanadas. My flautas were extremely spicy. To the point where I finished almost all of my water and my mouth was burning. I couldn't even eat the empanadas because my tongue was numb.The waiter had disappeared and did not appear to check on us until much later. When he did, we were getting late for the opera and couldn't return it. I told the waiter the flautas was very spicy but that my husband and I wanted the empanadas and the fish that he ordered but couldn't finish packed to go. He barely said ok. Picked up our food and boxed it.I can understand that sometimes food will be spicier than expected but, given this dish was not marked as spicy on the menu, I would've at least expected an apology or a comment that he will tell the chef or an explanation or an offer to see the dessert menu. Nothing. We were charged for the flautas. What was even worse is that we realized after we left the restaurant that 1) my empanadas and his fish were packed in the same box and so my untouched empanadas were soggy in the fish sauce, 2) he didn't pack the sauce for the empanadas, and 3) the box wasn't closed properly.Horrible service and very disappointing.  It's certainly not what I would expect of this restaurant.

An Arizona native, I am no stranger to authentic Mexican cooking, and have been to my share of upscale Mexican eateries far superior to Rosa Mexicano. The problems are many. The food is absolutely soulless, whitewashed, and overpriced. Table side guacamole for $15 is robbery. They use ONE avocado for an order and our table of four people got maybe two chips worth each. Only in NYC can a restaurant scam you into paying $15 for a $2 fruit. The rest of the food we ate was just whatever and definitely not worth the prices. I have this theory that people are less likely to give bad reviews the more money they've paid for something because they are absolutely embarrassed to admit how much of a waste the experience was. I think that theory applies here. I suppose if you are coming for a margarita and some chips/salsa, fine.

The tacos completely stuffed and were filled with big chunks of Mahi, cabbage, salsa and a flavorful tartar sauce. The flavors are an awesome mixture of spice and sweetness.

We had the guacamole made at your tableside, white sangria (refreshing on a very hot day), and I had tacos carnitas. The greatest compliment I can give Rosa Mexicano is that the food tasted just as good as the excellent Mexican food I get in a hole-in-the-wall restaurant in a Mexican neighborhood in Staten Island (Los Potrillos). In Staten Island, it costs maybe a quarter of the price -- but then again, over there, you aren't at Lincoln Center, and there's a huge difference in decor and presentation of the food. But I love that style of food -- nothing like the slop I never liked at the ""Mexican restaurants"" I used to know and dislike. If you know what I mean.",0,0,0,Laura B.,"Staten Island, NY",10,20,0

The waiter was pleasant and efficient.  We started with the table-side prepared guac. For entrees we chose the vegetable taco dish and the shrimp 'Alhambre' (?).  The vegetable dish was tasty, but the ""wild"" shrimp were somewhat over-cooked and just dull, and at $27 a big disappointment.  The $7 Pacifico beer was barely cold and served without a glass.

The Paramus location comes in second with great ambiance since the west side location is a bit dark and dreary. We made a 615P reservation for an 800P showing of War Horse at Lincoln Center (directly across the street) and everything worked out perfectly. I arrived a few minutes early and the hostess allowed me to be seated while waiting for my brother. The pomegranate margarita and guacamole (made table side with ease) are a must. We were pleasantly surprised to learn that Restaurant Week was going on -- and we were able to choose 3 of the popular items for $35 (we each had a margarita, shared the guacamole -- which counted as 2 items -- and also had two entrees). The chicken tortilla pie was a combination of delicious flavors (baked soft corn tortillas filled with lots of cheese, pulled chicken, peppers and sauce) and the shrimp brochette was a lighter option with grilled shrimp, tomatoes, onions and peppers over rice. They also gave us rice and beans on the side. We shared everything, and ended the evening with two double espresso. Despite a very crowded restaurant, service was excellent too.

It's classy and service is good. However, the food was beyond mediocre. The famous table-side guacamole is not better than any other place I've experienced - I'd say it's a pretty standard guacamole. I had cheese enchiladas that were so overstuffed with cheese (and so lacking in sauce) that it was like eating a big blob of melted cheese. The most offensive was my elote (Mexican corn on the cob). It was slathered in mayonnaise to the extent that it was inedible, whereas good elote should have queso fresco and spices on it. Fish tacos were decent but pricey for the portion size.

My boyfriend and I came here on a Fridaynight during dinner service and didn't have very high expectations after reading some of the reviews , we both work in the industry and have high standards, after dining there I must say that from start to finish everything was AMAZING! I arrived 15 minutes late but since I called the hostess was wonderful enough to save my table, as we walked up the beautiful stairs we were greeted by another lovely host who had a wonderful smile and greeted us with a friendly HOLA. She escorted us to our table where she pulled out the chairs ... All while keeping the smile. A few minutes later we were watching another smiling employee make us table side guacamole, which ended up being the best we've ever had. Our server Francisco came over and greeted us explaining the guacamole and guiding us thru menu, he was so pleasant and so knowledgable about the food showing great passion and enthusiasm really making our experience amazing. His table side demeanor was wonderful and we couldn't have asked for better service. The food was absolutely amazing but the service really took it to another level. I myself manage an upscale steakhouse in the city an I must say the friendliness of all the staff from the hostess when we walked in the door, to the bus boys , to the wonderfully happy women making the tortillas really made my experience exactly what a dining experience should be.

You would expect big plates with no food inside but this is not the case.Lobster flautas, Pork pozole, Cochinita pibil enchiladas and Mahi-Mahi. It was all spectacular specialty the enchiladas (there were 3! And big) that came with a really tasty rice and bean puree.But that was not all! The desserts! They got me there...

The sauces they provided were both unique and spicy. For the main course, I had the pork tacos. This was fantastic for me because they allowed me to build the tacos myself. I made somewhere around nine or ten tacos with what they provided. It came with juicy pork, grilled pineapple, sour cream, two sauces, refried beans, and brown rice. All for $20.

I also really like the artwork displayed on the waterfall by the stairs. My last visit here I even insisted on taking pictures by the stairs this was of course after one too many margaritas. This is definitely a place for upscale Mexican food. I've always been more than satisfied with the service at this location as well. On most visits here we automatically order the guacamole and this is probably the reason why I give this place 3 stars. For some reason I unlike the majority of the other reviewers I am very unimpressed by the guacamole here, is really nothing special except that they come to the table and mash it up in front of your face. I also think the guacamole here is completely overpriced for what it is that you are truly getting, but I know that I am in the minority on this. I tend to stick to the same food items whenever I dine here and is usually seafood. I absolutely love the way the salmon dishes and that's usually my go to order. Last time I was here I ordered the salmon poblano with kale and the sauce was delicious!! Of course if you are coming to this place you really need to drink a margarita, my favorite is the Unica margarita.

Now let me say this again.... WHY DOES THIS PLACE ONLY HAVE 3.5 STARS???? First, they called me in toronto to confirm my reservation and in case I needed any special arrangements. Then I almost got drunk off the one margarita they made for me... I love tequila. Like LOVE tequila... But I'm a total lightweight. They have the guac table just like Vegas.... Love it.

1.0,1/18/2015,"Trying to find something new near Lincoln Center. The food was acceptable, our waiter Napoleon was lovely and attentive. But the greeters downstairs behaved awfully. The world ""hospitality"" means that you're there to make people feel welcome. We were there with a friend in her 80s. When we arrived, they said it was too late to seat us downstairs and that there was an elevator to get upstairs you had to take by going outside again. Which we would have done, but the hostess made into such a big deal of it...so that our older friend was determined to just use the stairs. Making fragile or disabled people feel bad about needing an elevator, or making them wait longer than necessary without assuring them you're on it, and you care - there are actually laws that govern this kind of thing. We had a late dinner after a late film, and we were closing the place down. We went downstairs to leave, and one of us went to get the car from a garage.  The two of us who remained (including our older friend, who can't walk distances)  waited inside as it was 30 degrees outside. Getting the car took longer than expected, and rather than saying, ""Excuse me, do you need help with something?"" or ""I'm so sorry, but we need to lock the door now,"" the bartender literally made a shooing motion as if to say ""get out of here now!"" as if we were annoying pests or stray dogs rather than paying customers waiting for a car on a freezing night. So we went outside, and our friend with the car came like 3 minutes afterwards.It was clear it was closing time, and we would have waited outside, too, except that my friend is older and standing isn't the best for her leg. Have these people, like, never known an older person? We wouldn't have even minded being asked to leave -- we realized the place was closing and wouldn't have wanted to keep the workers longer than they were supposed to stay open, but YIKES, if you can't act like a host, don't do this job. It's about making people feel comfortable, and about understanding that people literally have different physical abilities. I feel about this kind of treatment the way I would about racism or gender discrimination  at a business. Don't serve the public if you can't leave your prejudices and your stupidities and your irritation at home. Respect older people. Pay attention and be professional. Clearly this business knows how to hire professionals, because of how helpful and pleasant the waiter was, but they need to get their ground-floor host staff together. I'd say it was just one nasty person, except that both people on the ground, the bartender and the hostess, were icky and mean-spirited  and unprofessional. Bummer.",0,0,0,JM L.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,19,0

3.0,1/4/2015,"We spent Christmas in NYC and slacked on making dinner reservations so had to scramble at the last minute. Our options were limited, complicating matters was that I need to eat gluten free. Rosa Mexicano fit the bill and had openings on Open Table.The food was good, not great - but I did like that it was unique Mexican food. We did the prix fixe menu and got to choose an appetizer to split, entree, and a dessert for $40/each - great deal in NYC.  We ordered the guacamole which was probably the best part of the meal. It was freshly made and spicy - although didn't care for the tomato. My steak/chicken was tasty but not great - I think I only ate less than half of it since the tortillas were cold. Can't speak to the dessert since neither of the two options were gluten free.The restaurant itself is beautiful with great decor - especially the wall of divers going up to the second floor. However the service was really slow and poor - even though everyone was really friendly.We had an Open Table reservation and we waited about 15 minutes to get seated. Once we got to our table we could see why - there were a ton of tables that were empty but not cleaned off. Maybe short staffed on Christmas?Our table had no napkins and we waited a good 20 minutes for water. Then there was a mix-up as we had 2 different people come take our orders. Our guacamole also took yet another 20 minutes or so and when it finally arrived, they were out of tortilla chips so we sat there for a while looking at our guac. Finally our waiter came back with a half-filled basket of what clearly looked like bottom of the barrel tortilla chips. It had taken so long to get our appetizer that our entree came out about the same time and then it took forever to finally get the check. The staff was apologetic for all of the delays, etc. but it still made for a not very enjoyable Christmas dinner.

During our meal, we tried the mango margaritas, which were good but not as great as the pomegranate ones. I was definitely feeling a little tipsy when we left. For dinner, my date got the Mahi Mahi... and said it was alright. I got the shrimp taccos that were pretty tasty. The biggest disappointment of the night was the guac. Out rolls the large cart and we were expecting it to be made in front of us like all the reviewers mentioned... however, the waiter just put it down on the table, already made. Although the portion was large, the guacamole itself was kinda average. Nothing memorable... Overall, I would come here again (if I wasn't paying for it). The food was good, but forgettable. The margaritas were delicious but you could get them cheaper at other places on 9th ave. If you want to take someone to a nice location, with great service, and a decent meal (and don't mind spending a decent amount of money), this is your place. However, there are other (and better) hotspots to explore on 9th ave.",0,0,0,Maria C.,"Manhattan, NY",16,24,15

We ordered the guac and it was made within minutes table side. You also get chips, red salsa, green salsa and ""warm"" handmade tortillas. Hubby got the mahi mahi which he thought was just ok.

This is definitely not your average Mexican food restaurant, as well as not your average casual restaurant. Upscale Mexican food with upscale decor and prices.Granted, they have a really cool cart with fresh guacamole and ingredients- but I think it's a little overpriced for good guac... I actually prefer mine from the local Tex Mex places in the neighborhood. I ordered the Pork Tacos- which actually came as deconstructed. They even came by with fresh, homemade tortilla shells.

After being seated, chatting for a bit, and going back and forth on what to start with, we couldn't decide what we wanted most (I probably drove that indecisiveness, when don't I want to eat everything?!). We decided on the table side guac medium spicy. The waiter comes by, pushing a guacamole cart on wheels with tons of fresh ingredients, and makes it to your liking. I love this! Not only was the guacamole delicious, it was super fresh. I even squeezed a couple avocados to determine their ripeness (when he wasn't looking of course). Ask for extra salsa (both kinds), even though they aren't spicy, they are mouth watering delicious and compliment the avocado perfectly.Veg friends ordered the enchiladas with sides of beans, rice, and veggies. I ordered the steak tacos but nixed the tortillas. I asked for the steak medium and it was made really well, super flavorful and delicious. It looks like a tiny serving but it's super filling, don't be fooled! The mixed peppers complimented the steak and they were perfectly sautéed.

I wish I could give a review without even putting a star because that's how disappointing the restaurant was. We live in the area and never went to Rosa Mexicano but today we were walking past and decided to give it a try based on fantastic reviews. First of all, the service was so slow, we ended up canceling our guacamole after 15 minutes had past from ordering it. Oh and our drinks? Took nearly the same amount of time to get. Super slow service was only the beginning. The food was average, and then we got our entrees. I got the Salmon Kale Salad, which sounded very appetizing, but when I got the plate, it was a plate of kale. Finally I found some salmon in it and when I did it made sense on why it was hidden - it was raw! We're talking sashimi style! After just pure annoyance I asked for the manager, who then proceeded to pretty much blame everything on me and the server, who he claimed should have told me that that's simply the way they cook their salmon - medium rare. That wasn't medium rare, Sir, it was raw and it was still cold in all the pieces. Disgusting. I couldn't even stand to be in the restaurant any longer.

2.0,10/6/2014,"Came here for a friend's birthday dinner. There were six of us, service was fine, drinks were good, food was ok. It's just a chain Mexican restaurant, a little upscale maybe, but still just a chain restaurant. Standard Mexican food, nothing special, prices are a little high for what it is. If you've truly elevated the cuisine I don't mind paying more for ethnic food that is traditionally inexpensive, but here they've just elevated the prices. You're paying for atmosphere and the exorbitant costs of running a chain of huge restaurants, the food isn't really that high quality, delicious or authentic. That being said, the atmosphere is enjoyable enough, maybe has a touch of that sterile, corporate feel, but overall it's pleasant to look at. We ate on the second floor, it's nice that the dining rooms have enough space so you're not squeezed in elbow to elbow with the tables next to you, there's some breathing room, rare for a NYC restaurant. I personally wouldn't choose this place for a night out, there are too many other good places in the city and I'm not really a fan of chain restaurants, but I guess it's fine if you're in the area with a group and just want some drinks and appetizers.

You can get much better for less, in a real NYC experience, with actual NYers just a handful of blocks south along 9th Ave in Hell's Kitchen. (Many to choose from.)The real question: Why would you travel all the way to NYC to dine out, and then eat in a chain restaurant? Aren't most people coming to NYC to experience NYC?This is a tourist spot, where you can mingle with other tourists, wondering what it's like in the NYC city all around you.It's also extremely loud with a cold, sterile feeling--which is perhaps how tourists imagine NYC, so they assume they have experienced it--but the opposite of most good, cozy NYC dining experiences.The guacamole was quite good. (And made tableside: a touch of Benihana added to the Bennigan's.) I had the pork shank, which was OK/bland flavor and very dry. Last time I had the Alambre Camarones, which were much better.

We had the short rib-seasoned perfectly, each chip was filled with nacho-goodness! Definitely wanted more after that. Very decent size-good app for 2!Ok, the trio enchiladas. It was just ok. I enjoyed the chicken the most I think solely bc the sauce was most tangy (the brown sauce). What it was wrapped in was not soft or tasty. I already forgot how the pork tasted. Next! Actually, the only other dish my husband & I surprisingly enjoyed was the sides-rice & beans. We were sure to savor every last morsel!

Finally came here after attending a ballet performance at Lincoln Center and um wow! First off the guacamole (which almost everyone has commented on) is fantastic. Super fresh tasting and delicious with the right amount of flavors. We ended up getting two orders of this. Then I was in loveee with the queso fundido. Some places when you order this it is just a glop of cheese and a ton of grease and no real flavor. That was not the case here. It was creamy and a nice texture plus the rich flavors and just the right amount of saltiness. A little bit greasy to let you know what you're eating is probably not going on a Weight Watchers menu anytime soon but well worth the artery clogging. I had the flautas (delicious, perfectly crisp, nice tender chicken filling with two coordinating sauces which were the right amount of heat and sweet) and the mexican street corn which was absolutely perfect (nice juicy kernals, fair amount of the chili powder mixture, crema and cheese... yum!)

4.0,5/8/2014,"Disclosure: I live in Tucson, often work in Mexico, and went to school in Santa Fe, so I know great Mexican food. This place was SO close to getting five stars, but the outrageously expensive sangria and so-so guacamole brings it down a notch. Otherwise, the food was phenomenal and the service was top notch. I couldn't believe how attentive the servers were, and even when I went to the bathroom, all the employees I passed said hello and smiled, whether they were other servers or kitchen staff. Our server knew almost every ingredient, and if he didn't know he was happy to check with the kitchen. He suggested substitutions for vegetarians and recommended getting huitlacoche for the queso fundido. Yes, you read that right; huitlacoche!  Who knew you could find such a fantastic ingredient outside of Mexico?  And that leads me to the next point. All if the ingredients were amazing. Even though the guacamole wasn't as flavorful as one finds here in Tucson, it was exquisitely fresh and ripe with no hard chunks like you find at lesser places. We just had to add some of the salsa on the side and it was good (though not great).  The veggie tacos, on the other hand, were divine. Again, stellar ingredients all the way around. Sadly, we were shocked to find that our little pitcher of sangria cost nearly fifty bucks once taxes were included. Ouch!  It was good, but not great, and you can get a better, larger pitcher here in Tucson for less than half the price. Plus the interior of the restaurant is beautiful, but so noisy we practically had to yell, adding to the cacophony. These were fairly glaring minuses, but the blatant quality of the food and service more than made up for it, and I would certainly return again.

On busy nights, be prepared to wait even if you have a reservation, though it's typically not too bad if you arrive on time.I would warn that take out takes a long time even for nearby locations.

I wanted to celebrate my B-Day again this yr here, this time I wanted to bring my Cake. They told me that it's $5 per person to cut my cake (reservation of 16 ppl), if I wanted to get their cake it would be $8 per person plus 18% gratuity. My cake itself cost $40 and now to eat it I have to pay another $90! That's RIDICULOUS!! Most restaurants charge $3 on the bill. I ask what does my cake come with a mariachi band!? They said no. I told them no thanks, cancel my res. I'll spend my $700 else where just because you can't cut my B-Day cake for $3. Manager had the nerves to tell me that's a reasonable price, and that's how they stay in business (ripping people off!?), I asked him to name me 3 restaurants that charge per person to cut a cake, he couldn't answer. I told them to send me an email of my cancellation, instead I got an email of a reservation confirmation.

4.0,2/24/2014,"So my partner made a reservation for restaurant week.  Got there for lunch and they were right on time, checked our coats and generally had excellent service.  So for me, almost every mexican food experience begins with the guacamole.  Here they make the guac fresh at your table.  It was a fairly sizable amount as well.  It was quite good.  In addition to the chips most places provide, they also give your small flour tortillas so you can make little guacamole sandwiches or whatever.  My partner loved this (mostly because it probably allowed her to eat more than her fair share of quac) but I still prefer the chips.  The salsa's were also very good.  I read a review that said everything is salty, but that wasn't my experience outside of the chips.  The chips were a little salty, but that's how i like them.  So on to the menu.  I had the chicken enchiladas.  They came out nice and warm (as did the plate which always makes me wonder) and my partner had their version of steak fajitas.  We'll start with her.  Her steak was excellently prepared.  I thought the flavor on the beans could have been better.  My chicken enchilada was fine.  I didn't notice it one way or another as we chatted our way through the meal.  So in my opinion that means it wasn't horrid, but it wasn't amazing either.  For dessert we had the flan.  It was pretty doggone good.  Had sort of a coffeeish flavor too it.  I was quite stuffed by then, but definitely put down a few bites before having to give up.Finally my drink.  I'm totally blanking on what it was, but it was a house special margarita of some sort.  They definitely don't hold back on the tequila pour here.  If i had to rate this place on just my meal alone I'd say three, but the dessert, drink, guac and overall feel of the place was great.  Maybe a little pricey, but it's NYC....",1,0,0,Kendrick W.,"Chicago, IL",125,273,130

It starts early around 4 and goes till about 6 or 7. Make sure you check! The selections are great and because of this area seating gets packed. NY is very strict about people moving chairs around due to fire code violation. So you just might be standing or waiting for an opening, if you are determined to do HH. I had the margarita, fish tacos and my friend got  a carafe of sangria, which is 2 drinks for one HH price.

2.0,2/7/2014,"Rosa Mexicana (Lincoln Square) dinner on 02/07/14We decided to go to this restaurant because it was my brother's friend's birthday celebration. He was in the mood for mexican and something a little nicer; Rosa Mexicana was an obvious choice for that. However, I hadn't been here for quite some time and was very disappointed with this visit.-Atmosphere: great lighting (not too dark, not too bright), white table cloths, large restaurant with plenty of comfortable space; noise level was a little high (nothing to really complain about though), not impressed with the lack of decoration-Food: Baja fish tacos- yummy! perfect amount of food, although it was a ridiculous price; they gave it to me dairy free which I was happy about. Fried Plantains- fantastic! they were as authentic as I have ever tasted them and the price was perfect for the amount of plantains you receive. -Drink: A frozen pomegranate margarita- delicious; but I could buy all the ingredients, make it the same or better, with 10 more times the amount, for the same price. -Service: staff isn't the best; it is not fun to go to a restaurant when the staff has no sense of humor. I totally understand being tired from a long day of work, I worked in a restaurant and hopefully will get a job in one soon; but to not smile and ignore customer's comments is just plain rude... in the long run a great attitude will make everyone's evening better.-Overall: Rosa Mexicana is an upscale mexican restaurant that has pretty good food but for the price it is somewhere I never wish to return. Authentic Mexican like I have had before is better, cheaper, and will always have a better atmosphere; it is my goal to find the best in this city. To want to return over and over again I'd need something more. In the meantime I will enjoy eating at Chipotle- which never disappoints.",1,0,0,Liza D.,"Manhattan, NY",121,4,0

The table side guacamole came out first. It was really good (I've dined at Rosa Mexicano in NJ a number of times so I have an idea of what to expect). Then came our appetizers. I chose the lobster ceviche, which basically was a lobster salad that was extremely salty. I wouldn't order that in the future. My one friend ordered the hamachi tacos and said that the aioli sauce overpowers any other possible flavor. For entrees, I ordered the crab enchiladas. Once again, the sauce for my enchiladas was ridiculously salty. My other friends ordered the filet mignon, steak and chicken, and the shrimp over rice. They seemed to enjoy their selections, but none of them raved about it. For dessert, we were all given the churros with dipping sauce. They had chocolate, raspberry, and caramel. I know it isn't saying much, but these were probably the best churros I ever tried. Granted I've only had like 50 cent churros at places like Costco.The service was fine here.

2.0,9/3/2013,"IN SHORT: A restaurant that can talk the talk, but can't seem to walk the walk. With sterile, unexceptional food indifferent to any flavor, Rosa Mexicano is best enjoyed by a group that will too be indifferent to the outcome of the meal.THE STORY: 15 years ago, William Grimes of The New York Times described the food at Rosa Mexicano as ""pallid and dull,"" and yet he still believed that there were ""enough bright spots along the way to offer hope."" Today, after too many mediocre, flavorless meals, I have a hard time imagining what those bright spots might have felt like.From chilly guacamole with an unripe, stiff, and chunky texture that highlights tomatoes more than it does avocados, to oily, under-seasoned fried white fish in the Baja Tacos, the food at Rosa Mexicano hits the palette like one major disappointment after another. These disappointments are made even more surprising when the menu itself reads like a more thoughtful composure of fine foods written by someone educated in the craft. The Baja Tacos advertise Dox XX battered, panko crusted fish topped with house-made slaw and jalapeno tartar sauce, but in reality are stale, dry, and begging for more salt. The grilled corn on the side is a single saving grace, offering the balance of sweet flavor desperately needed in the dish.But this represents Rosa Mexicano's deepest failure: offering a genuine promise to provide authentic, regional Mexican cuisine, and instead serving cheaply made food that lacks the passion and vibrancy so integral to such cooking, while caring very little for this conceptual inconsistency.So with all of its shortcomings, how has Rosa Mexicano managed to stay in service for over 30 years? The answer is the eternally busy and cheerful staff that recalls the zeal and enthusiasm of our beloved neighbors to the south, as well as the restaurant's pervasive reputation for its tableside presentation of guacamole. The showy display, belying otherwise disenchanting food, nonetheless manages to add the festive flair so often craved by the crowds that embrace ""Taco Tuesday"" and are only after bottomless, slushy margaritas from a Slurpee machine.The long list of cocktails serves not only to increase the youthful volume of the raucous, downstairs space, but also to numb the tastebuds to the weak, subdued fare. The ""signature"" pomegranate margarita is marketed by all the servers with fervor, yet has not mastered the depth of its bittersweet flavor. It is a drink for happy hour, for an exuberant night in Las Vegas, not for a restaurant that aims for culinary excellence.Even its two-story fountain wall designed by David Rockwell promises far more than the restaurant can actually deliver. Over the entire wall, a series of little plaster men appear to be swan diving in joyful euphoria toward the bottom of the pool trumpeting a crescendo of flavor that never comes to fruition. Alas, perhaps a glimmer from the iridescent blue tiles on this wall is the only bright spot that remains at Rosa Mexicano.",4,2,1,Ali M.,"New York, NY",31,234,245
2.0,9/2/2013,Update:Rosa Mexicana contacted me to try and I guess talk about my experience.  Except as of Sept. 10 they never got back to me.  The Manager of this location Jay Holmes said he would call me and he never did.  I don't care if they ever call but I don't think it is fair that they respond to my review to make themselves look like they care and never follow up further.   Very disappointed in my overall experience.  The restaurant is beautiful but the food and service didn't match the prices.   This isn't cheap Mexican food by any means.  Most dishes are between $20-$30.  We started with the guacamole which is made table side.  Our waiter was very specific to point this out to us even though we were sitting outside.  When you sit outside you don't get to see it made.  Not a big deal but don't tell us it's going to be made there if it isn't.    Another service issue was I didn't have a place setting.  I asked 3 times and never got one.  After the food arrived I asked again and I was given a fork and knife.  I still had no napkin and had to take one from the table behind us.  The guacamole was very good but could have used a touch more salt.  The chips were a little soggy but maybe that was the outside factor again.While placing our dinner order we asked what was in the house special rice and our waiter said it was rice with cilantro and scallions on top.  Perfect my wife has some dietary issue but that all fits into her can eat list.   She ordered the shrimp brochette entree.  I ordered the chicken skillet style. The dishes came out and as they were being placed down I noticed the rice was brown rice.  I asked the waiter to confirm and he said we only have brown rice.  Brown rice is not an ok food for my wife.  It wouldn't be an issue had I not asked the waiter to tell us what was in the rice and He failed to mention it was brown.  Now my wife was left eating 5 tasteless shrimp for $27 and nothing else.  Mexican food is supposed to be full of taste from all of the great spices.  This was plain grilled shrimp nothing Mexican about it.My chicken was a little dry and not overly tasty the street style corn saved the dish.  Nothing I would ever crave again.   Maybe I'd go for a drink and chips but the food and menu otherwise was not exciting.  A step above a national chain.,0,0,0,Jeff G.,"Forest Hills, Queens, NY",162,208,259

Tuesday , where according to the website, all tacos are available for HH.  The bartender told us it was only the fish tacos and the pork belly and scallop tacos that were available that day....ok....I ordered one of each, and received two fish tacos.  When I inquired about my original order, he told me they couldn't be mixed and matched, which I think was utter BS on his part.  At the very least, he should have told me that when I placed my order.The two of us also ordered the guac, which was sadly missing salt...of all things!  The margaritas were decent, but you can't really mess up a drink.Either the website needs to be updated, or the bartender needs to be regulated, OR BOTH.  In any event, our experience here sucked.",3,1,1,Sandee L.,"Discovery Bay, CA",235,494,105

Its served with roasted corn, rice, and black beans. Its a little silly of a dish as the entire dish is very dry when you assemble your fajita which is quite unfortunate. We were seated next to their waterfall which is very nice ascetically but little did we know they seat you next to the water fall because there isnt a chance on earth you'll ever get a refill of your water or drinks. The service is atrocious. After our order was taken we were practically abandoned and had to continually get up to ask the hostess for basic things like silverware, serving spoons for the salsas etc. I'd go back for guac and margaritas at the bar but thats about it.

The signature pom margaritas are good... but I've had better.  I mean, her food is solid.  The place is cute.  It's just a wee but overpriced for what it is (I don't care what you say, Mexican food is never worth $28 for an entree.)

Bummer.  They happily re-made it = good service, and with a good attitude. However it was marginal.  Too much cilantro, not enough or any, fresh jalapenos.  The scallops + pork belly tacos...out-f***ing standing.  As a previous reviewer noted though the fresh corn tortillas experience break through so I doubled them up with the extras from the guacamole.  Recommendation is to order an extra set of corn tortillas.  The dish was substantial - you could easily create 5 from the 3 they deliver.Service as ""ok.""  Water was filled...once.  My beer went dry twice.  But it was busy and the server had a great attitude unfortunately he was also of the ""everything is good on the menu"" variety and when looking at such a substantial menu doesn't help much.  Would I go back.  Yes?",0,0,0,Jason K.,"Troy, MI",125,64,194

Although meant for two, I finished it off myself.For the entree, on the server's recommendation, I had the Chicken Tortilla Pie (Baked soft corn tortillas filled with pulled chicken, Chihuahua cheese, corn and roasted Mexican peppers, served with a poblano pepper cream sauce.)  It was very good, I really enjoyed it - it did not blow me away, but I would go back for it again.  However, the refried black beans DID blow me away.  I have never had refried beans that I liked - never.  But, it is my NYC trip and it is RW, so I tried them.....and then I had more....and more.  They were delicious with the Tortilla Pie, adding a bit to each bite just created a wonderful taste combination.Finally, the Espresso Flan was delicious!

4.0,7/14/2013,"Rosa Mexicano over Dos Caminos any day! My fiance and I took my parents to this location for Sunday brunch since although they'd been to NYC over dozens of time, they'd never walked through Central Park or even knew what it was exactly. So on this lovely 90+ degree summer morning, we walked over a mile from the east corner of the park to the west.. a little over 30 mins later, we finally arrived. Despite seeing numerous empty tables, we were told there was a 35 mins. My bad - should have RSVP on opentable prior but we were so used to the Midtown East location where we just stroll in. We hung out in the corner by the bar while studying both the lunch and brunch menus. Some customers chose to order from the bar. We considered it but since it's not often that we get to take my parents out, we wanted the full dining service. By 25 mins mark, we were finally led upstairs.Our host was at the end of the stairs to welcome/greet us. We were seated at the booth by the stairs. The upstairs dining room is spacious and well lit by natural light - surrounded by window. My parents were impressed by the deco and immediately took out their ipads to snap pictures. Upon given the menus, our server asked us if we were interested in getting their signature guac. We initially said no in which our server made a really surprised frowny face. Then my fiance and I decided we should let my parents try it even tho us two weren't craving. After waving down our server and told him we changed our mind about the guac and ready to order, the guac master and his station was moved right next to our table and we were ready for his demo. Although the guac was simple, the taste was simply amazing. It came with 2 types of salsa - the green is much milder than the orange one. So glad we decided to order it for the table. The small was portioned for 2-3 people but more than enough to be shared among the 4 of us. At first glance, my parents stopped and asked me how to eat it. My fiance and I showed them how to scoop the guac with the chips and tried each with the 2 types of salsas. After first bite, they became instant fans! They began discussing getting bags and bags of corn chips and avocado from Costco and making them themselves lol. My parents are so Asian and cute.I was pretty full from all the chips and guac but there were still entrees to come! My dad had the chicken tortilla pie, mom had the scallop/pork belly taco, fiance had the egg/porkbelly torta, and I had the tuna loin salad. My dad loved his dish - creamy but not too heavy and it came with a side of rice and black beans. My mom's dish was the most unique, pork belly with scallop? who knew the flavor profile would be so amazing! Even with my mom's picky palate, she was a huge fan. My fiance thought his pork belly and egg sandwich was well made. The bread a little too hard to bite through so he broke it apart after the first half of the sandwich. I'm not a big pork belly fan so I didn't ask for a taste. The only disappointment from this place was my salad. The tuna loin was pretty blend so I ""shared"" all my tuna pieces and ate more of everyone else dishes. Wished I could trade in my salad for another small guac instead.  Overall, a very enjoyable dining experience. Service was attentive, food was delicious aside from blend tuna.

It's more on the smooth side, but you can tell it's not highly processed like smooth guac that you would buy packaged at the grocery store, and it's not too rough either. The consistency is good, and it's not too thick either - as in it stays together, but they put enough liquid in it to keep it more on the ""liquid-y"" side.It tastes very fresh, and has a slight spicy kick to it. I liked it (and I can't eat spicy food at all).The braised pork ribs are okay, they are nothing to write home about. Left much to be desired actually. Neither juicy nor super tender.

I have never had Mexican food this bad. First and foremost, neither the guaca nor the nachos were anything special. But still it was eatable.Then came the raw Tuna starter and what a travesty. Raw tuna with orange and cucumber. The dish just made no sense. I mean we knew that when we were ordering but we thought maybe the chef will fashion an awesome dish out of it. Unfortunately had to leave half of it as it was totally tasteless.Finally, I ordered the grilled fish (in skillet). From the looks it looked awesome! But it was equally tasteless. Most of my friends had the same experience (Those who did not were too drunk to notice :)).Anyways the deserts were the saving grace, but I guess that can happen anywhere",1,0,0,Asad A.,"Jersey City, NJ",52,14,0
4.0,4/24/2013,"I mean, you know, typical theater district dinner prices (so rather expensive); attracts a pretty diverse crowd of theater-goers, tourists, and locals. They have some pretty good drink specials. I would recommend for a special occasion or a date. The guacamole was quite good, but I wasn't WOWed like others seemed to be (perhaps the price threw it off for me, and it wasn't a lot for 2 people...) Order a pitcher of sangria- it's awesome! I had the ahi tuna ceviche to start, and the pork belly and scallop tacos as my entree. Everything was cooked perfectly and the seafood was fresh. The various toppings were really delicious. Overall,  I was very satisfied with my meal, but with drinks and guacamole it was around $70/person... way more than I was expecting to spend walking in. And we didn't order dessert. The ambiance is lovely, and on a crowded night it's still not too loud so you can carry a conversation.

Both times I have ate here, I was upstairs which is quite nice with the large windows. I've been there for both brunch and lunch. Every time I visited was on a weekend either before or after a Lincoln Center performance, so, I suspect their busiest times.The table-side preparation of the guacamole is their signature. It's generally very good, though nothing out of the ordinary. The kids love the process. The chips are nice and thick.They have a kids menu with the usuals which makes it good for families. The tables are generally spacious and comfortable. They have some tables that are also half-booth.Everything I have tried there is good, some is great. The braised short ribs - great. The enchiladas - good.Really, the other thing that sets Rosa apart is their impeccable service. I have always found everyone there very attentive, trying to anticipate and meet your every need.

We also had the Ceviche Sampler, which again was fresh, but definitely missing lime juice. It was served at room temperature - I would have preferred chilled.

1.0,3/20/2013,"This place is a HUGE joke.  It's in my nabe so I ordered delivery.  I ordered crab empanadas, chicken flautas and plantains.  The best thing about the whole experience was the lovely hostess or waitress who took my order over the phone.  She's a real assest to the business.  She helped explain things about the menu and was friendly, professional and fantastic in her service.  Then, it was all downhill from there.  Instead of the delicious, flaky crust you expect from an empanada, theirs had a gummy, spongy texture that was pretty bad.  The lump crab inside was okay, but the pieces of onion were too big.  But mostly the crust really killed the experience.  Bad, bad, bad--and an empanada should be basic for a fancy joint like this, right?  The plantains were extremely oily, like they took them out of the fryer and didn't even bother to rest them on a paper towel or anything.  WORST of all were the flautas--chicken rolled in corn tortillas with crema (which they were extremely stingy with) and cheese on top.  The sauces that went along with the empanadas and flautas were okay--tasty but nothing special.  The flautas were soooooo dry, lacking flavor and any of the unctousness you expect from a rich dish with lovely cheese and crema on top.  They were so stingy with the crema, there was barely any on the flautas.  I should have known better than to trust some Americans trying to do Mexican food--they have a nerve even calling it Mexican!  This is a pretentious, ridiculous establishment with pretty decor and a good location.  But when I sit down at a table I can't eat the pretty pictures on the walls or the fact that its across from Lincoln Center, so who cares?   If you want Mexican on the UWS, and you live closer to the upper 70's/80's  try The Great Burrito on Broadway.  The food is ten times better than this pretentious, over priced crap, and is authentic--made and owned by the real people of Mexico.

4.0,2/25/2013,"A few friends and I checked out Rosa Mexicano after catching a movie at Lincoln Center. We got there around 9:30, and it was SO packed. Luckily, just as we arrived there was a couple leaving their bar table who let us have their seat.Loved the ambiance of the restaurant...there's definitely a modern, hip feel to it. First thing I noticed as I sat down was an entire wall of water along the staircase going to the upper level. The wall was dimly lit, as if from within. There were tiny clay figures of human divers placed all over it, as if they were all diving off the edge of a waterfall. So cool!On to the eats/drinks. I ordered the signature pomegranate margarita. To my delight, it came in a cute glass with a salted rim. And it was delicious! It was smooth, tangy, and sweet but not overly so, with just the right amount of kick. My friend ordered the classic margarita, which was a beautiful bright yellow color. It was definitely much stronger than my fruity drink, and I don't think I would be able to finish it had I ordered one myself. The menu also had an extensive list of wines as well as sangria, which I would love to come back to try sometime.Next up was the guacamole. It was freshly made next to the table and served in this cool stone vessel-like bowl. It was definitely more on the chunky side as guacamole goes, but that happens to be the way I like it. Texture aside, the taste was fantastic. The blend of spices made the guac uniquely flavorful, and it the soft corn tortillas on the side made for a perfect base. There was also some habanero and tomatillo salsa served alongside the guacamole, and man these were spiiiicy! I am an avid spicy-foodie so many of what my friends consider to be spicy are pretty mild to me, but the salsa here definitely packed a punch, especially the habenero one.Lastly, we ordered a plate of fried plantains topped with a cream sauce and freshly shredded cheese. I'm not the biggest fan of fried plantains but these were really good! The tartness of the plantains were tamed by the sauce, and the cheese added savoriness that paired nicely as well. I'd definitely recommend Rosa Mexicano if you're looking for a relaxed night of food and cocktails with friends.

It doesn't look huge, but it sure is filling. For desert, the banana chocolate chip (bread pudding?) was exquisite, although a tad on the small side for sharing (no, I'm not a pig). The server was excellent, always topping off my sangria, and the manager came by and gave us a free sampling of an appetizer of pulled chicken.

The signature dish, though, has to be the table guacamole, which is made in a stone bowl fresh in front of you by a guacamole artist who uses whole avocado and other ingredients to whip up the best guac you've tasted.The vibe is a bit more upscale than the typical Mexican restaurant and you will see a mix of well-dressed ""after work"" patrons, patrons on dates, and casual tourist-types all  eating together.   Their signature drink is the pomegranate frozen margarita, and you should try it.  Service is usually wonderful, and even when it is not at its best it is still pretty good.If you're hungry for extremely high-quality Mexican, you will not be disappointed.

It's not cheap, unfortunately -- but the food is always tasty, expertly prepared, and doesn't make you wonder why you skipped the taco truck.Something I found interesting was that Jonathan Waxman was associated with Rosa Mexicano -- sort of a Chef Emiretus, of sorts -- and I had lots of regard for Rosa Mexicano prior to learning this, so it didn't shock me or affect my opinion. Essentially, I know that if I'm craving some really excellent mole or table-side guacamole, this is where I can go to procure it. The kitsch -- the swimming/diver guys on the fountain wall -- are nice, and the decor is really lovely, in a sort of post-modern 70's Brady Bunch house vibe -- but holy calypso, the margaritas are great, the food is wonderful, and the bill isn't too-too bad at the end of the night.A worthy location for visits and return visits.

3.0,9/30/2012,"Capping off a weekend in NY,  I came here with the parents and the BF for an early Sunday dinner.  This gorgeous upscale Mexican restaurant near Lincoln Center and Columbus Circle has a buzzing crowd, strong drinks, and delicious food.  Although our waiter was attentive and the service was good, a slow kitchen and noisy neighbors did put a small damper on our evening.  Still, it was definitely a cut above your typical chips and salsa joint.We started with the guacamole, crab empanadas, and the crispy chicken tacos.  All were fine, but especially the guacamole.  I really like how it was prepared tableside, and it tasted just as fresh and bright as it looked.  For dinner, I had the steak tacos: a little cast iron pan full of delicious, perfectly seasoned sliced Carne Asada with metled cheese, and three different kinds of sauce (a creamy corn sauce, a smoky bean sauce, and a spicy chipotle sauce) with corn tortillas.  Very very delicious and while the meat may have been a little more tough to chew than I would have liked, it was still good.  I probably enjoyed it more since at this point I was nearly two pomegranate margaritas in (see next paragraph).  For dessert, we split the espresso flan (good) and the tres leches cake (better).  I love tres leches cake, and this place had some of the best tres leches cake I've had in a long long time.  You should definitely save room for dessert.The only downsides were that we were seated next to a couple of young families with loud children, who spent their time either sleeping or making noise and crawling around us.  Not terribly thrilled to have been their neighbors (which led to my mom, myself, and the BF to get another round of margs), but did appreciate their apology to us on the way out.  The kitchen was also really slow tonight, so while the guacamole and the appetizers came out rather quickly, our main dishes took a really long time.  The waiter informed us that a large delivery order was to blame for the backup, but when our desserts also took awhile to get to the table, we all started having doubts about the kitchen's ability to keep up the pace.  I also didn't like how other tables around us, who arrived later than us, seemed to be served faster and finish ahead of us.  Not that we were in a rush, but I didn't appreciate that.  Nevertheless, our waiter was very nice and attentive, and the staff definitely tried to expedite our food and make our experience pleasant.Overall, it's a beautiful space with really good food, drinks, and desserts.  However, the slow kitchen and our poor location in the dining room did mar our experience a little bit.  It's able to fit any and all groups, from small to large parties, but I think this place truly excels in working the pre- and post-theatre crowd, as well as smaller parties.",2,0,0,Barrett L.,"Washington, DC",822,287,0
1.0,9/29/2012,"Inconsistent, overpriced and vastly overrated. I've been here a few times and the food is ""alright"", not all right. Like many Mexican restaurants, they try to get you with the overpriced drinks and appetizers. I don't care how much you love guacamole, it's not worth $14 for an appetizer. A half pint sized margarita is not worth $10 and neither is Sangria for $14 a glass.The entrees aren't any more impressive as my suizas (chicken) was overcooked & dried out.

I always walk past it going to school and I had always wanted to try it. Finally my friend and I went on Cinco De Mayo. As you can imagine the place was packed but luckily I was able to make a reservation. We got a seat outside as it was beautiful out, perfect for sitting outdoors. They start you off with mountains of tortilla chips and homemade salsa. The salsa was delicious. Nice chunks with a little kick..it was good because it was a little bit spicy but it didn't build on you which I hate. They had a fixed menu because of the holiday so they didn't have their regular menu which disappointed me..at first. The meal certainly made up for my disappointment. I got chicken enchiladas which were a grand slam in my opinion. They chicken melted in my mouth and the sauce and they cheese were balanced perfectly in the dish. The flavors were so good it was like a party in my mouth. My taste buds were certainly happy. I had a chance to go back and eat off the regular menu and the second time I got quesadillas which were perfect. The cheese and chicken were so tasty I finished my whole plate.

3.0,6/29/2012,"My husband and I were invited for a dinner gathering to celebrate our friend's MBA graduation party. The interior at this location was impressive with its rustic furnishing and upscale ambiance. We all shared the guacamole en Molcajete and fresh salsa as well as a round of pomegranate sangria and signature cocktails for our table (though I had to skip due to pregnancy). The guacamole was nothing spectacular and came out rather a bit salty. The salsa had a much better consistency.  I had the salmon con salsa de frutas with sweet corn, kale, and pancetta ragu over a habanero-winter fruit white wine sauce. Hub had the carnitas (lamb) tacos. The dish came with onions, salsa picante, and poblano peppers. And it was served with red bean chorizo chili, corn esquites, and warm corn tortillas. The rest of the party ordered chamorro (pork shank), chicken tortilla pie, rancheras (vegetable) tacos, and Flautas de Pollo (rolled crispy chicken tacos). Dessert was the fav highlight for everyone. I had coffee and Tres Leches de Zarzamoras (Blackberry three milk cake). Hub enjoyed his Flan de Rosa (espresso flan). I loved the sour pound cake soaked in three milks, infused with lemon and lime, and finally topped with blackberry-hibiscus glaze and toasted meringue. Now that's what I call sophistication, the pastry chefs did an excellent job! Hub's dessert was no exception since the vanilla flan was infused in espresso over a warm chile brownie and topped with Mexican cinnamon whipped cream. It was marvelous! I would come back for dessert. The food is a different story. For the high pretentious authentic upscale Mexican cuisine, I'm sure there are definitely other places that tops over Rosa.  The bill came out to over 400 not including tip for a party of 6.

And yes, when you do choose to visit, margaritas are a must!Months later, my boyfriend and I lucked out on a table without having to make a reservation. The host was very nice and accommodated us by shifting a few tables around. I was super excited, and of course, we started off our meal with some margaritas and table side guacamole. I was super psyched to see duck with mole on the menu and decided that I had to have it. The mole was spot on and the gnocchi were great  as I hate nothing more than mushy gnocchi. However, the duck itself was a total disappointment. Upon ordering duck, one would expect to have a crispy skin to go along with the succulent game. Unfortunately, the chef that night failed to render enough of the fat to crisp up the duck skin, but at the same time, magically overcooked a good portion of the meat. Now, here's the thing..... if this dish was given to me at some average Mexican restaurant, I would have given it lots of love, but this is Rosa Mexicano we're talking about.

4.0,4/15/2012,"We had a pre-opera nosh here; we snagged a table for 2 at 5:30 without much competition from the UWS after-work crowd. The pomegranate margarita is as tasty as the rest of Yelp says it is, and stronger than one would expect from a pink blended drink (and how brilliant for such a large restaurant -- make your signature cocktail something that comes right out of a slushy machine, so it's a fast pick-up). Be ready to settle your bar tab before you are seated; apparently they don't pool tips here. Our server was not only foxy and well-versed on both food and drinks (he offered me the requisite warning about the Mezcalito cocktail -- although it lists strawberries as an ingredient, more prevalent on the palate is the smokiness that comes with any well-executed mezcal drink, so it's not as girly as it reads on the menu), he was also an incredible busser. You may not realize that clearing a table -- in one trip, without having to ""be right back for that"" last plate, without dropping a knife on the floor with a mood-killing bang -- is a skill, but you should appreciate a great busser when you see one at work, especially when heavy stone guacamole bowls are involved. The aforementioned guacamole is made table-side, and is as fresh and delicious as you would expect, but not as spicy as I would have liked. (""This is gringo-spicy!"" said my dining companion.) The hamachi tartare is topped with a cilantro granita that looks weird but works. The crab empanadas and chicken flautas are A-OK as well. Don't skip dessert -- they have a lovely espresso flan and a fine selection of homemade ice creams and sorbets (mmm... salted caramel).It's the poshest of the Rosas, with the blue tile wall fountain adorned with small white diving figures, and a big upstairs where they have private events. The last time I was here our bartender said he had been working at this location for 9 years, which in the restaurant world might as well be a lifetime, so despite mixed reviews I've heard about how the company treats its employees, they must be doing something right.It's fancy Mexican food in a sexy setting. Perhaps if it were located in another part of town I might only have given it three stars, but for the UWS-Columbus Circle-Lincoln Center area, this is a solid option for pre-show nibbles or post show potables.",4,2,3,Maya F.,"New York, NY",70,147,21
3.0,4/6/2012,"After reading a bunch of reviews, I know I'm in the minority, but  I really thought Rosa Mexicano was just average.  Let me get this out of the way first - the food is tasty.  I didn't have any problem with the food itself.  And the waterfall / diving man situation was pretty awesome.  What I did have a problem with was the following:1. The hostess had bitch-face on the entire time while we were waiting for our table.  We had reservations, we were on time, we were friendly.  What more do you want from us?  Honestly, she reminded me of the hostess from ""Date Night"" when Steve Carell and Tina Fey go to Claw.  2. The service was pretty lackluster.  There was a pretty long wait between ordering our drinks and ordering our food.  And we were starving.  At least we ordered the guac right when we sat down. 3.  The portion size.  If I'm paying $25 for a taco, I'd like to think I""m getting more than 6 slices of steak, and 6 tiny soft shell tortillas.  4.  This place just exudes ""chain restaurant""2.5 Stars, rounded up because the Margaritas were extra tasty.",5,5,1,Clifford R.,"Manhattan, NY",50,169,8
4.0,3/25/2012,This is the best Mexican restaurant I have been to. It was very good. Service was great. The big event there is the fact they will make guacamole at your table. I have to say though a fun idea the appetizer was not as good as mine. I asked for spicy and it was as mild as you can get but it was still good. The chips though were great. I was surprised they didn't have shrimp tacos and so I ordered the steak ones. Delicious. The mexican rice is the best I ever had. They had the most fabulous list of tequilas I have ever seen. I would have loved to try them. I had the sangria which was delicious. Great time!,0,0,0,Diane B.,"Oviedo, FL",21,252,6

2.0,3/6/2012,"One of my favorite things about Spanish food (other than the fact that I'm Spanish) is that it is so ridiculously easy to order vegetarian. I always have a sense of relief when I walk into a Mexican restaurant; I know I wont have to worry that there aren't any exciting vegetarian options. In spite of what I just said, as a vegetarian, I know that I would be a fool to not check a restaurant's menu before I go. What hooked me about Rosa was the huitlacoche fondue. Huitlacoche is a type of corn mold given the same sort of worship truffle is usually afforded. I'm not a huge fondue fan, but I've been hankering to try huitlacoche since Rick Bayless sang it's praises on Top Chef Masters forever ago (also when I fell in love with Rick Bayless, Latin inspired chef with multiple Chicago restaurants). I was excited about the fondue, but I wanted to get something other than the appetizer. Right about this time I remembered that you should never come to restaurant that you only want one thing at. I ended up also ordering a one note salad, and that's all that needs to be said about that particular menu item.When we ordered, the server seemed shocked that we didn't want the guacamole. I've seen guac made at the table before, it's not that impressive and I'm sure theirs wasn't any better than the (fantastic) guacamole I make at home. I was a little put off by their expectation that everyone would order this one dish. I guess maybe I looked extra touristy or something that day. Or perhaps the server was just surprised that someone who lived in Manhattan would come to Rosa Mexicano. My partner ordered some sort of meat sandwich with fries, which he ate about a third of, so we'll let that stand as his commentary.The fondue was bland, and came with limp little tortillas. The fondue to tortilla ratio was way off, I was left putting far too much cheese on far too little tortilla. I couldn't even identify a flavor for the huitlacoche. All I tasted was the mushrooms and corn that were also in the fondue.I also ordered a michelada, my partner just got a negro modela or some other cerveza, I can't really remember. My michelada came without a salt rim in a glass with a really chunky lip. Weird. I sent it back asked for salt. It was pretty tasty once it was made properly. Rosa was okay, but all in all, I just was not pleased with this place and I'll most likely never go back.",1,0,0,Amanda G.,"Manhattan, NY",136,27,3
4.0,3/5/2012,"This is where you go when you want a classy taco.I've been to the one by Union Square and really enjoyed it; and to leaving the Metropolitan Opera Friday night I had a rumbling tummy, a hankering for guacamole, and it was raining and I had my hair did and no umbrella, so Rosa Mexicano was the natural solution.I love the waterfall wall in the front. It is so cool. The float staircase is neat as well. We were seated on the second level, there's a nice view of Lincoln Center. This visit was strictly for booze and a late night bite, so my hubby and I order guacamole and round of their signature pomegranate margaritas.  I thought the whole thing with making the guacamole at the table is a bit gimicky. I don't care to watch it being made, I just want to eat it. But ohmigod it's so good fresh!The pomegranate margarita: delicious and effect (the one gave me a good buzz). Service here is impeccable, though it did feel a bit awkward when my husband left the table for a moment and one of the [bussers?] came by and refolded his napkin.

4.0,2/7/2012,"I went here with my brother and his kids after a show they went to at Lincoln Center.  The place was packed with kids which makes me believe this is pretty popular option for families after/before they go to Lincoln Center.Bro and SIL had the pomegranate margaritas which they thought were awesome and very strong.We ordered some guacamole and asked for one to be spicy and the other to be mild but both tasted the same to me.  I love my guacamole to be spicy (maybe it's my Indian tastebuds) so this was a slight disappointment.  I resolved this by mixing their green + red sauce + the guacamole which made it spicier. The kids had either the steak tacos and cheese enchiladas.  The portions are the right size for kids and come with some veggies (corn, etc) and fries.   The sweet potato fries were awesome and fried to perfection.I split the veg enchiladas with Jaimin S. and thought they were pretty good.  The enchiladas were drenched in a tomato based sauce (wish it had more of a kick) and topped with some cheese and greens.  We desperately needed some hot sauce for the enchiladas, but it was impossible to get the attention of our waitress (-1 star for this).   The rice and beans they served for the table were delicious.Overall, I think this is a decent option for Mexican in a city that's lacking amazing Mexican food.",4,0,3,Neelam P.,"New York, NY",119,939,1380

They asked if we had tickets for a show that night and what time and we were seated immediately when we walked in. Service was attentive but not rushed. The guac is like everyone says absolutely amazing. Over priced at $14?? Sure. But it was soooo good. The rest of the meal was actually very well priced for what you got. My husband had the duck mole and it was excellent - perfect mole sauce with the yummy spicy chocolate taste. My chicken tacos were yummy too - the tacos are assemble-yourself so you can make them how you want them - a little messy but so so good. They came with some yummy spicy bean side, a sauce that was good and some corn. Super good. The table also got some great rice as a side and refried beans. I LOVE refried black beans but theirs were just too salty - dial down the salt a bit guys - I don't need to feel like I stuffed my face hours later. For desert we got this banana-chocolate-peanut butter mousse desert. Hard to describe but impossible to resist.

4.0,1/23/2012,"""Don't forget the mexican spices...The spice is the art in the heart of cooking.""Rosa Mexicano is a nice treat when your near Lincoln Center.  I absolutely love their incorporation of true mexican flavours and ingredients.  I suggest trying to go during off-peak times as it can be packed, especially if you plan on snagging a spot at the bar with an after-work crowd.  The decor is really interesting.   I find there to be a huge disconnect in the aesthetic and vibe downstairs and the one that is delivered upstairs.  Downstairs (bar area) is fun, lively, colourful.  Its what you would expect looking at the exterior.  The lighting is interesting and sexy and what is more memorable than the diving wall.  (You have to just go and see it)  If you decide to make a potty break and head upstairs you are whisked away into...well a place I would expect my Grandfather to go. It's a bit stuffy and sterile.  The white table clothes IMHO are just a snooze fest.  When compared to the upbeat experience downstairs and the beautiful presentation of the food, it just is a miss for me.The food is great!  The fresh guac made table-side is always a hit.  Rosa provides a well balanced menu delivering varieties of meats and fish.  The steak I had was so juicy and was perfectly seasoned.  They give you plenty of tortilla's so pace your self for the portions as they are on the larger side.

When we explained that we had called 20 minutes ago and were told we could get a table the hostess was rude and uncaring. The fact that we had two children and there was no place to sit or stand to wait and she never said anything to apologize for the misinformation was frustrating. We called again and were given a 5:30pm reservation, which we then confirmed with the hostess. Thinking it would then be only 15 min wait we stood in the cramped waiting area for another 20min. At 5:40 I asked  how long before we could be seated. The hostess acted like I was bothering her and said ""a few more minutes"". When I asked for an approximate time, she said there were 4 people ahead of us. This would have meant at least 30 more minutes. Again, no apology, no consideration, only dirty looks and bad attitude.

A connoisseur of good food would likely snob this place, especially someone who has frequented dining holes in the south of Mexico. There are probably dozens of  Mexican restaurants charging half the price in New York city that are much much better than this place. For example, I happen to know for a fact that Marry Anns, a Mexican restaurant in Chelsea,  serves a much better authentic Guacamole than this place, but the atmosphere is dismal unless you like a bunch of noisy Chelsea clones now forcing food down their throat inches away from your face while trying to get your attention. Unfortunately, atmosphere plays a role in dining and this place has a nice atmosphere. I may revise this review in the future and give this place a 4.

3.0,8/15/2011,"First things first: the guacamole isn't that good.  The only thing that stands out about it is the ripeness of the avocados; any obsessive-compulsive could obtain that perfect creaminess if they wait long enough.  The guacamole is just so...uninteresting.  It's avocado mush with a few sprinkles of cilantro and onion, and, if you so choose, jalapeno. Where's the cumin!?  Where's the garlic?!  Why no tomato option!?  I'm well aware some people will shoot me down because ""that's how they serve it whenever I go visit my shaman near Oaxaca,"" but whatever.  It's certainly not worth the $12 a bowl.The food is fine, but it's just so unnecessarily pricey.  The quality, attention to detail, and inventiveness far outpace your run-of-the-mill Mexican restaurant, but I don't think those places are trying to do anything new.  The portions are fair and the food is good, but certainly not more than twice as good as anywhere else, which is what you're paying.  The restaurant is horrifically crowded - reservations are a must.  Don't even think about stopping in for a drink at the bar.  The building itself is cool, particularly the wall full of diving dolls (don't really know how to describe it better than this...).  The upstairs is too frumpy, though - sit outside or on the bottom floor if you can.Three stars.  Rosa Mexicano tries to reinvent Mexican food and does an OK job, but doesn't go nearly far enough for what it charges.  The fact that you really need to make a serious effort to get in (no stopping by and grabbing a table) turns me off; if I need to snag a reservation in advance, Rosa is not at the top of my list.",2,1,1,Sam H.,"New York, NY",169,39,0
4.0,8/15/2011,"I came here with my parents for lunch and we LOVED it! We walked about 2 miles to get here, so our appetites were ravishing! From reading all of the yelp reviews prior to coming here, we knew we wanted to try their guacamole--so that's what we started with. It was delicious! My parents were in heaven. It was made right at our table with fresh tomatoes, onions, cilantro, salt, pepper, and jalapeno peppers. For our entrees we got the Market Salad, the White Fish Tacos, and the Steak Tacos.....and another order of Guacamole--we couldn't help ourselves, it was just so good! :) The market salad was nice and fresh tasting. The fish tacos were actually a little disappointing. The fish seemed to be cooked in butter and a little too dry on the outside. But the red bean chorizo chili and creamed corn sides were delicious! The tacos are served with warm corn tortillas which were absolutely wonderful! I filled them with the fish, corn, beans, and guacamole. But the winner entree was my Dad's carne asada tacos (steak tacos) which were cooked in an array of flavorful spices and topped with Chihuahua cheese and salsa. Despite being super full, we had to try their ice cream trio sampler--Mexican chocolate, roasted graham cracker, and carrot cake. They were all so good! The chocolate ice cream had bacon bits in it, which was a little weird, but of course we ate it anyway.Our waiters were so great, very attentive and seemed happy to serve us!",0,0,0,Cindy H.,"San Francisco, CA",9,47,37
4.0,8/5/2011,"I recently attended Rosa Mexicano on Thursday July, 28th, 2011.  The first thing I noticed was how lively and crowded the bar was on Thursday @ 6:00pm.  The second thing I noticed was the beautiful blue, water-drenched wall.  It is a work of art containing hundreds of little figures in a motion that reminded me of someone diving into a blue lagoon.  Its one of those things that you have to see to understand.The party (3) I was with made a reservation ahead of time.  We were able to give our name and were taken directly upstairs to our seat without any issues.  We were taken to a seat with a beautiful view of not only the restaurant but of Columbus Ave as well.  I would like to note that it was VERY COLD when we arrived.  I would suggest wearing long sleeves.We ordered the table-side guacamole.  As the name suggests, a friendly waiter makes it right at your table.  You have the option of which level of spiciness you prefer.  We choose HOT.  The GUAC was simply awesome.  Just add a dash or two of salt, and you have what may be considered the greatest guacamole I have every tasted.  BAR NONE.  I ordered the steak tacos/fajitas; with the steak being cooked medium-rare.  The food arrived within 10 minutes, and the first thing I thought was ""this is a lot of food.""  The steak had a great smoky flavor to it, with the cheese being melted right in the skillet.  I would have been satisfied only eating the steak.  I was able to make three soft-taco/fajitas. It comes with all of the standard fixings - rice, beans, etc.  They were great!  My only complaint with my entree' is the soft-tacos.  They were a bit small, and lacked flavor.  It was less of a soft-taco or tortilla and more like a bland ""wrap"" to combine all of  your meats and sides.    The other members of my party enjoyed their meal as well.  IF one is looking for a great, authentic Mexican/Latin in New York City, then ROSA MEXICANO is a must.  Be prepared to spend a little, but comparatively speaking, it is definitely worth it.",1,0,0,Trey S.,"Charlotte, NC",515,232,612

I think getting a drink before somewhere else and showing up to your res on time would be a better bet since Rosa's bar area is small and usually very crowded.I brought a date and was happy I did, it was quiet enough for us to talk pretty easily but still had enough energy around us to be able to get a little silly.

Coming from California, where I have ample access to authentic Mexican cuisine (both downhome-style and fine dining), I can't say the food here is at its most authentic, but it was still very, very tasty.We had exceptionally tender and thoroughly-marinated carne asada, fresh guacamole, cheese-and-bean quesadillas, pulled chicken sandwiches (which could've fooled me for pork), and this amazing, aromatic brown rice with scallions. Everything tasted good. I can't say there was anything I had that I did not like. Yes, they are a little pricey for Mexican food. I was shocked when the Events Coordinator revealed how much she spent on catering, but just about everyone at the company had good reviews over the food, so I guess it was worth it. *** CORPORATE PARTY PLANNERS...PAY ATTENTION!!! ***This caterer arrived early and was set up early, while able to keep the food warm for the masses that rolled in later.

2.0,7/20/2011,"First let me say I have always wanted to eat here. It's a hot spot in NYC and I was looking forward to the Mexican flavors that I know very well both high end and low end in NYC. My boyfriend and I went for Restaurant Week and we had a reservation, we showed up half an hour early and had to wait until our reservation time, no problem, we waited at the bar with a pitcher of Mexican Sangria. Our reservation time came - we were told to wait - another half an hour goes by - we are still told to wait - its not until my boyfriend gets a little upset that all of sudden they have a table and when I get upstairs there were quite a few tables available. Ok fine we sit, literally as the waiter gives us the menus he asks if we are going to have guacamole - we haven't looked at the menu yet - Really! I say we don't know. The Restaurant week menu allows you to either share Guacamole or have ceviche or soup. So both of us decide to have ceviche, the dish was chopped tomatoes with a few unseasoned shrimp (they were not made ceviche style at all) and some green herbs and no flavor. My boyfriend poured the dipping sauce from the chips on his to give it some flavor. I ordered the salmon with mole and he the filet mignon skewers with Spanish sausage and peppers, his dish was very good, mine lacked the mole flavor it needed to be good, the salmon was cooked perfectly but again where is the Mexican flavor. One Golden star goes to the desserts which are to die for Cheesecake and Espresso Flan. I understand the Restaurant Week menu is just a glimpse of the regular menu but I would think you would want to impress people enough so they would come back again. I feel that they dropped the ball with the appetizers because they assumed everyone will have Guacamole and my entree was not seasoned because they think the clientele may think its too spicy, at least give us a choice, this is New York City after all.",3,1,1,M P.,"New York, NY",0,4,0

Does it really get any better than this place? I realize this choice may lose me some credibility points -- but people, be honest with yourselves!!! Rosa is the epitome of comfort food for me. The absolute hands-down best guacamole I've ever had. The most consistently delicious variety of dishes. The most potent margaritas in the city -- tried and tested by NY Mag. I can think of no better way to spend an afternoon than to sit at the outdoor tables, drink a frozen pomegranate margarita, and stuff myself silly with guacamole. In addition to guacamole, they give you a smoky chipotle hot salsa and a chile verde mild sauce with your meal. Both are INCREDIBLE. I would eat those by the gallon in my every-day life if only they were available for purchase. In no particular order, dishes I love include: enchiladas suizas, chicken flautas, alambre de camarones, short ribs... um, pretty much everything. If Rosa Mexicano were human, I would marry him/her for no other reason but their ability to satisfy.Caveat: One plate that I'd classify as mediocre would be the ceviche. The rest is phenomenal.

Service was good. They didn't make the guac tableside though. They didn't have the little flair that makes the service @ Rosa oh so extraordinary. My friends loved it though & I continued to adore. Another Rosa opened @ the National Harbor. This one has a balcony with outdoor seating overlooking the water. I went here on two separate occasions. Both for lunch. Same issue. The restaurant is lovely, as I expected. Guac not made tableside. While the service is good it is not exceptional. I love this Rosa. I love it because they focus on the small details & those details really add up to a truly spectacular experience.

Rosa nails it, with a version that is a touch sweet and beautifully complex. This is my favorite mole to date. Everything else I've ever had here has been wonderful too.

4.0,3/29/2011,"Being from LA, I was lamenting the other day that there are no good Mexican restaurants in New York where I can get my basic tacos and guac. That is when my friend recommended Rosa Mexicano and since then I have already visited this place twice in two weeks.I can't say it beats Taco Por Favor (my standard for good Mexican tacos - for those who don't know this is a hole-in-the-wall taco joint on Olympic Blvd. in Santa Monica) but definitely comes close to being one of my favorite places in New York.The guacamole is great and is freshly made at the table. Though I asked for it to be spicy, it wasn't spicy enough for me. So may be next time I should ask them to make it ""super spicy."" One thing I like about Rosa is that they serve the guacamole with both tortilla's and chips. This comes in handy to people like me who count calories.The pork belly tacos are to die for. Perfect in it's crunchiness. Pair that with the pomegranate margarita and you have a winner there. The spicy bloody mary is good too for those who like a little bit of kick in their cocktails (I certainly do). The other divine dish (yes I really mean divine) is the Pelona (short rib sandwich). It is juicy and meaty ... perfect.The chilli rubbed fish tacos were not my favorite. Just because it somehow did not come together for me. The fish used (probably mahi-mahi) was extremely fresh (despite what Anthony Bourdain says about ordering fish in a NY restaurant on Sundays) and the side of beans and chorizo was yummy. But it didn't come together when I rolled everything up in a taco. The meal ended in wonderful note with the tres leche milk cake. A must try.",0,0,0,Chaiti S.,"New York, NY",5,23,0

3.0,2/22/2011,"I want to give this place a 2.5, but I'll give it a 3, because it's more 2.6 than 2.4, and I'm just in a good mood.I've been here twice, once for a weekend lunch with my visiting parents, and once for a Friday night dinner with friends. The two experiences were very different, with the only consistent factors being the attentive wait staff and delicious guacamole, so I will write about both and let you garner your own judgment.When I went for lunch, the place was pretty much empty. We were seated immediately, and tended to courteously. The waiter recommended the guacamole, and of course, we obliged, then we were served our main dishes. We got the tortilla soup, chicken enchiladas, tuna loin salad, and another dish I don't remember, which should indicate to you that it wasn't very memorable, and none of us were impressed with the food. The margaritas were also just OK, and they don't serve blended mango margaritas, only pomegranate!!! What's up with that?So that was lunch.For the Friday night dinner, we arrived at 8pm without a reservation. We ordered drinks from the bar and some guacamole, of course, and sat there for almost 1.5 hours. That's right...1.5 hours. We waited and waited and asked and asked, and they kept telling us we were up soon. The wait staff and front desk were very courteous, but not very helpful.1.5 hours and 90 bucks later....We were finally seated. I have to say that this time the food was much better. I ordered the Alambre a la Mexican, which is basically nice chunks of well seasoned juicy filet mignon and chunks of chorizo on a bed of rice. I also got a side of refried black beans, which was the best part of the meal for me (I have a weird obsession for good refried beans). My sister got the rolled crispy chicken tacos and sweet potato fries, and they were both described to be very ""yummy!!!,"" so that plate went well. Our two other companions got the chicken enchiladas, and the first comment one of them made was ""I should have gotten YOUR dish"" (referring to mine). One of them also got a side of chili, and after one bite, he let us know by facial expression that it was borderline disgusting, and didn't take another bite. The other guy got some fried plaintains, but I honestly don't remember them on our table, so I don't know how he felt about those.All in all, it's a fun atmosphere, with nice people, but 1) you should make reservations beforehand, 2) you should be prepared for limited margarita selections, 3) you should know that for the quality of food the prices are quite high, and 3) you should read reviews before making food selections, because some of their menu items (ie tortilla soup and chicken enchiladas) should not  be ordered.",0,0,0,Sarah M.,"Honolulu, HI",0,24,0

3.0,2/2/2011,"""Overpriced mediocre Mexican"" pretty much sums it up. I get the feeling this place is meant for people who want Latin American food but need to impress a date, business associate or visitors and thus are wary of trying a louder, cheaper, less sexy and more authentic in-your-face Mexican joint.The guacamole was fresh and tasty. I like that it's made tableside, to taste, and comes with tortillas so you can make yourself a little guacamole taco instead of chowing down on chips. The enchiladas suizas, which everyone got but me, were declared to be plain. I liked my salmon, but the mole it came with was dry and according to my Mexican friends, not truly a real mole (could've fooled me- which, now that I think about it, was probably the point). The desserts were the best part of the meal- the pinguino (a big chocolate cupcake with chocolate mousse filling, topped with whipped cream and a chocolate slab for the head) was super chocolatey and rich, and its presentation really made it look like a penguin. My friends pointed out that their pinguinos had holes for eyes in the chocolate slab, and mine did not. Oh no! My pinguino was blind! Pobrecito pinguino :( ...but that didn't matter for long, 'cause I ate him up. Yum yum.Service and decor are both excellent- we were very well taken care of and the restaurant is beautiful, dimly lit in orange, red, yellow and pink, and the huge stone wall that serves as a waterfall is admittedly very pretty to look at.

3.0,12/30/2010,"NYC has a weird complex about Mexican food - there's very few (if any) red sauce joints, and even fewer that are actually tasty.  Then there are the plethora of places that celebrate true Mexican food from Mexico, relegating combo plates and chimi platters to the back to make way for smoky mole and delicately braised meats.  Rosa Mexicano falls in the latter category, but somewhere along the way, got lost in hype and trendy spendy decor.When you walk in the door, you are greeted by mounds of roses and an incredible water fixture symbolizing the cliff divers of Acapulco.  Maybe, just maybe, you are in for an authentic treat.  But the place wanes in the form of the $15 guacamole pimps who push a dish that cost them mere pennies.  Until they start flambeeing tableside, I don't see the need to jack up the prices so high.  Quesadilla de Huitlacoche is earthy and yummy, while some of the crab dishes (including a Crab/Shrimp Relleno special) were fishy.  Mixiote de Borrego is tender and melts in your mouth, while the Budin de Pollo tastes like a deconstructed chicken enchilada.  Totally unmemorable.I love the idea of Rosa Mexicano and the decor is indeed ever-so-sexy, but truly, other than for coctails with friends, this place is a bit of a snooze.  Cafe Frida kicks their butt big time, and all for a lot less scratch.",1,1,1,Angela G.,"Arlington, VA",62,149,0

I wonder what the owners of Rosa would say?)The atmosphere is very classy, yes, but artificial from a Mexican standpoint; the food is overpriced and very average and I would never order a main course or appetizer again.Now, if you've read my reviews before, you'd know that I abhor chain restaurants in the city and you might wonder why I consider Rosa to be ""A-Ok."" Rosa is a special exception due to the quality of their guacamole, served with chips and fantastic flour tortillas, and their margaritas. I will admit that both are very overpriced, but the quality of both are fantastic and the combination of a salty margarita with heavy guac can't be beat. I've racked up some hefty bills at the bar, but unlike many restaurants, I have no regrets about my money spent at Rosa.Sadly, they no longer offer their free spicy peanuts at the bar. It was explained to me that this has something to do with a new New York City health code law. Personally, I say 'health shmealth.' I want my free peanuts.

I love this location! Walking distance to the Lincoln center. One day when I am rich and wealthy (yea, I know that's redundant), I'll enjoy a lovely early dinner and drink at Rosa Mexicano followed by the ballet. It will be absolutely grand.... one day (sigh..)Of course we ordered the guacamole. How can you say no to their signature dish especially since it is prepared tableside? Well, you can't. The description says one order serves two and our waiter suggested getting a double order to feed our party of 5. We decided against his suggestion and stuck with one order. Guess what? There was plenty of guacamole to go around. The verdict? It was absolutely delicious! When you watch them prepare the guac, it seems almost simple enough to make it yourself, but I don't think I could ever make it taste that good! Everyone must order the GUACAMOLE!Side note: does anyone else think of Austin Powers and the mole/guacamole joke when you hear the word guacamole? or is that just me? yea, thought so.I ordered a special: Octopus Enchiladas (of course it was named something much fancier in Spanish on the menu). I honestly expected a plate that would wow me. For $16-ish, I wanted to be sweating out beans and rice. So I was unimpressed when my fairly small enchiladas arrived at the table. Once I dug in, my quantity issues were quickly overruled by the amazing quality. Very tasty sauce smothered the entire plate. I was worried that octopus would be chewy or rubbery, but it was a nice consistency. I'm actually not a fan of corn tortillas, but these tasted freshly made. I was extremely happy with my order. We were also served family style rice and beans with our meal. Let me tell you their beans were surprisingly delicious! Definitely a nice side addition to the meal.

It made the meal.A co-worker and I stumbled across this place while looking for a bite after a meeting, and I'm happy we did - it was a totally pleasant dining experience, all the way around.The aforementioned guacamole came with baby corn tortillas, which made for cute little guacamole burritos. Yum. I also indulged in a house margarita - strong and refreshing.For dinner, I had tacos with grilled veggies. They came with beans & pork (that I couldn't eat for obvious reasons :) ), little corn tortillas and some grilled corn. All in all, the mixed veggies weren't bad, but they could have used more onions & peppers. I also could have used some guacamole and sour cream along with it, but my bad I didn't order them as sides. It was a non-traditional taco, but still tasty.My co-worker had enchiladas that came with rice and black beans. The black beans were DELICIOUS and made an excellent addition to my baby tacos.

HOLY FUCK. are you joking? i mean i've been to plenty a birthday dinner where everyone chips in for the bday girl but given i didnt even KNOW the birthday girl and had one tiny appetizer and one drink, $66 was really f'ing pushing it.i'm not sure how the prices got THAT high (probably something to do with that married couple getting a bottle of wine between the 2 of them when no one else wanted any), but seriously??? being shafted out of about $30 (which in reality my friend ended up footing some of as I didn't even BRING that much cash and wanted to bitch about the fact that i spent under $30 and certainly wasn't shelling out $66, so she paid for both of ours and i gave her cash) for a truly horrendous dining experience with subpar service and mediocre food (appetizer so obviously still starving) and drink ensure that i will not be back here.",2,2,2,Danielle J.,"West Village, Manhattan, NY",213,572,10

3.0,3/28/2010,"A solid place, although it's not quite true Mexican. Their guacamole is pretty damn good w/ lots of tomatos and onions in it. The avocados are fresh and the whole thing is put together at your table, so there is the added benefit of seeing your food prepared with fresh ingredients. I had a shrimp and steak stew which was very good. The only complaint was that it wasn't hot despite the waiter's claims. I couldn't believe he said he thought it was hot -- I know I can't handle real hot food but this barely registered a kick. It was really mild, which is sad. Mexican food should have spice or heat to it. Something with passion, I guess. This plate was just bland. Had the doughnuts (churros) for dessert. They weren't really hot out of the oven but they had an interesting crispiness to its outer surface with  a warm inside. They were served with chocolate, raspberry and caramel dipping sauces and all three were pretty damn good.The bar does a great job with mixed drinks. I wouldn't recommend actually hanging at the bar downstairs because space is at a premium. It's not comfortable. I recommend this spot although you'll have to be prepared to drop some coin.

We got there around 1 and things started to really pick up when we left as far as large groups and younger children. Even though the inside looks relatively fancy, for brunch time it was very casual. They make the guacamole at the table (which may be a bad thing when you're seated near a narrow aisle, as they have to step to the side when people are passing by). I got the Mexican City salad which really didn't have enough greens. However, the mango and pineapple where extremely firm and fresh tasting.I loved the guacamole here but at the same time, as long as it doesn't look like green diarrehea with no consistency or has a fake flavor, I'm always down for the guac. The waiter was average and his personality was a little dull. Armin L. ordered a quesadilla which looked good that day but when I warmed it up and ate it a few days later, the actual taste seemed akin to applebees. I would come here for several orders of guac and pitchers of sangria before heading out to the nearby movie theater or to Lincoln Center.(currently the view on the West side (I think) is a little crappy due to the construction going on @ Lincoln Center)",1,0,1,Samantha S.,"Brooklyn, NY",125,377,44

We actually walked in right during the typical dinner rush and were seated immediately. Off the bat, my girl friend orders a pitcher of red sangria and their 'world famous' guacamole. The sangria was perfect, not to strong, not to sweet. The guacamole was really good.After devouring the guacamole, we had our entrees. Me and my girl friend both had the Mixed Grill Brochette and my buddy had the chicken enchilada. Me and my girlfriend liked our dishes. The meat was cooked perfectly and was delicious. At first we got our plates and thought that was it..?! But after cleaning my plate, I was definitely stuffed! My friend liked his enchilada as well and it came with this neon green lookin sauce, which was verrry tasty. For dessert, we split the 3 milk cake, which basically tasted and looked like it came right out the box. I wasn't a fan...but if you like limey and tangy type desserts, go for it...Even with most of the food being pretty on point, I'm still not sold on this place. I'm not a big fan of upscale Mexican eateries for one. If I wanted to go to one, I'd go to Agave downtown. Then there are the prices. $34 for a pitcher of sangria? $25 for our Mixed Grill Brochette entree, which had like 6 small cubes of meet total on it..Even our dessert was $9 for a crappy piece of cake. If you want to charge high prices at a Mexican place, you better come with the goods. I didn't see the bill cause our friend took it and paid for it, but me and my buddy figured it had to be around $150-$170 for 3 of us. Where was all this money going to?

Anyway, so the guac is excellent - they serve it with chips and mini flour tortillas. The sangrias are decent. The white one is really good, the red one is average. The ""individual"" servings are mini-carafes that really amount to two glasses so you could probably just order for one, get another glass, and both have a regular glass of sangria.The meal was chicken in a mole sauce.

5.0,7/23/2009,"I have very bittersweet feelings towards Rosa Mexicano because I was a maitre'd there for 3 long years. Despite my feelings toward the way they treat their employees, I can vouch for the fact that it is company policy to treat their guests like gold. I hope you wonderful people reading this don't take it to mean that it is a ticket to go in and verbally chastise the poor girl at the front desk, because I have seen more adults than you can imagine throwing a tantrum worse than a child in their terrible 2s who was told they can not have anymore ice cream. So a definite downside to Rosa: assholes who think they are entitled to what they want when they want it, and have no concept of what is fair and realistic. However, this is a review and not an etiquette class on how to treat people in the service industry.That said, I will now mention that the food and service at Rosa is never less than perfect. If for any reason you think it is, tell them and they will make it perfect for you. I don't really think Rosa compares to Dos Caminos, and although people complain that the guacamole is over priced (which it is) it is definitely the best you ever had. Pomegranate margs are ok, but don't shy away from trying a different drink.  I love the queso fundido (of course) and I always get the carne asada tacos.. but every entree on the menu is worth recommending (except maybe the budin azteca). All 3 Rosa locations in Manhattan have a very different feel and atmosphere, and the one on the East Side has a different menu. However, the Lincoln Center location is their flagship baby, and the service and food here trumps that of the other locations.So yes, it is on the pricey side, but you won't be disappointed if you want a flawless dining experience.

4.0,2/1/2009,"As a hostess here from the past, you'd think I would be biased.  But before jumping to conclusions I just want to state that if you think about it, most people DONT like where they work.  I have seen sides of Rosa no regular guest would ever know about.  That said, I think my recommendations are worth something more then just an easy thumbs up from a former employee. Upper West side is the ""classiest"" of the three locations.  It tends to attract the Lincoln Center/Opera crowd, the more uptight customers, the celebrities, the tourists who know somebody.  Personally, as snooty as it may seem, I enjoy it because it has a quality to it that the other two don't exude.  Let's start from the entrance.  It's always a blast watching people figure out where the door is.  It's the big glass one right in front of you.  Not on the sides.  The bar to your left is always populated.  Sometimes there are some entertaining characters who are always up for a convo.  I have seen many first date meet ups occur here.  You can also order food to the bar which is a good option to a sit down dinner, if the bar is not too crowded.  Do not attempt this on a weekend night. Call for reservations if you are coming for dinner.  Especially on the weekends.  You can wait up to two hours if you dont.  The hostesses are not being bitches when they say they cant sneak you in.  There really is no room, as big as the place is.  As far as the menu, I like to describe it as gourmet Mexican.  It's not your typical texmex dishes claiming its Mexican.  Each dish has something just a little different about it that sets it apart from your other places.  I'm a fan of the guacamole of coarse, the steak tacos, and it's not on the menu anymore but they used to make a killer Chilean sea bass. I wash it all down with a frozen pomegranate margarita with salt.  If you are looking for a tasty brunch, many people don't think of a place like this but I would recommend it.  People who have been are usually pleasantly satisfied, if not more. It's not nearly as loud in the place during day hours so that is nice also.  Plus you have a better chance of sitting by the lovely waterfall wall everyone is obsessed with sitting by.  (Please don't spill anything though because it falls on the hostesses head.) Not to mention the staff are extremely accommodating!  :) From entrance with a big smiling hostess, to waiters who take classes to know precisely what they are talking about, to the ""have a nice night"" as you walk out the door EVERY time, you could not be upset with us for trying so hard to make you happy.",2,1,2,Are M.,"New York, NY",154,229,24

We would've been perfectly happy with the guacamole and our pitcher of sangria, but when I think back to the rest of my meal (I had the Salmon En Manchamanteles), it's like going back to my happy place. I love Mexican food, sure, but Rosa Mexicano totally ups it to a new level beyond the $2 tacos that I'm generally used to.Extra points to our servers who were gracious and attentive, but not annoying.  We left just as the place was getting super packed, but I'm sure they would have still kept their cool even with the eager crowd of diners waiting to have their turn at Rosa Mexicano.

A minor complaint.I got the short ribs which came in a really nice tomatillo-chipotle sauce, which I was hesitant to get cause unlike everyone else, I don't really like the taste of chipotle. This was amazing. Three huge chunks of off the bone short ribs. Drool. There was some discrepancy on the ""fall off the bone""-ness in the three. Two were spot on: juicy, tender, no knife needed.

3.0,5/1/2008,"Three stars is a bit higher than I'd like to give, but it deserves more than two.The table-for-two that we had was a bit longer than typical which made conversation a little louder. Our neighbors two tables over apparently over-estimated how much louder they needed to be since we became party to their first date chit-chat. I guess that is par for the course in New York restaurants.The margaritas (classic on rocks with salt) were nothing special. Lots of ice, little color or flavor. I couldn't bring myself to order a pomegranate one.The guac was impeccably fresh. Ingredients were great, but the result needed a little extra seasoning and a little extra mashing. I hope that the ""spicy"" that we requested was not conveyed since there was absolutely no kick to the guac and too little salt. The execution of our table-side  prep left us with a few chunks of avocado way too big for the flimsy chips. A little more effort would have been nice in breaking those chunks down, but we did that ourselves. The accompanying salsas were great.My date's entree (Arrachera con Camarones) was good. I ordered the Chile Ancho Relleno de Verduras which was mediocre.  Thee presentation of both was nice. The chiles were not battered and fried (they might have been just fried) which made the bitterness of the skin on the anchos a bit overwhelming on the first chile I had. The stuffing in that one lacked any noticeable goat cheese. All in all, not a good start to the entree. The other chile was better. The chile itself was less bitter and the stuffing had enough cheese to round out the flavors. I still think it would have been better with a light egg batter.The rice was deliciously flavored with cilantro, mint and scallions. The beans were standard, but good. We couldn't quite figure out where we were expected to place them. They came in serving bowls to be shared between us. However, the plates for our entrees did not have any room to plop down anything additional. It just seemed incongruous attempting to mix a fine-dining style entree with family-style sides. There was no side plate so I cleared a space on my plate of sauce to add my rice and beans.The chocolate souffle cake dessert was good. I couldn't quite figure out when or where I was supposed to use the tomatillo sauce (a tart counterbalance to the perfect vanilla ice cream or a strange glaze for the chocolate souffle cake. It was interesting with either or with both, but the dish didn't gain much except novelty with it. Or the fried flour tortilla triangles (Maybe these were supposed to be sprinkled with cinnamon and sugar, ours were not). Or the decorative caramel smearing the plate.  Regardless, it tasted great.All in all, I was not impressed. New York needs some good Mexican restaurants. This one just seemed to have not quite figured things out. But as evidenced by Rosa's expansion, New Yorkers will accept, even welcome, mediocre Mexican restaurants.

2.0,4/12/2008,"Wow - I really wanted to like this place, given all the positive things I had heard. However, I just can't.  First of all, it's a scene and I am not one for scenes. It's like the chain restaurant you are forced to go to when you return  to your hometown and all the kids you went to high school with are still there and think it's the greatest place ever. It makes you cringe, but they think it's cool to always go drinking at the same chain restaurant. I am sure you understand....onto the important stuff.Our servers were quite attentive and made sure our drinks and food arrived in a timely fashion. The margaritas were standard. Not what I would expect from a nicer Mexican spot at all. If you must, then try the pomegranate ones. The guacamole left me nonplussed. The food itself was just alright. What went beyond my expectations was the bill. You know that feeling when you go to a really mediocre place and realize you could have gone to a really good one for the same price?

It was actually really impressive how restaurant after restaurant so spectacularly bungled a pretty straightforward dish.Rosa Mexicano is definitely overpriced, at least when it comes to some of the simpler dishes, but at least whatever you get is bound to be decent. The service is generally good and the decor is great. They've also been accommodating when I've had special requests (for just cheese in my enchiladas or for a different sauce -  I've tried the red sauce, tomatillo and mole sauce, all of which were great). For desert, I really like the tres leches cake. Drink-wise, I've yet to try the margaritas that everyone seems to like, but I did like the sangria. Drinks are really pricey, though, so I pretty much always skip them.I've been to this location the most, but also to the location on 1st Ave and the newer location near Union Square.

4.0,12/6/2007,"call me an ethnicist if you will, but is there really an upscale restaurant class in mexico that eats high-priced authentic mexican haute cuisine? so what are we to make of the authenticity claims of rosa mexicano?regardless, in nyc a restaurant is a restaurant. this one comes off a little like a theme park, what with the waterwall (which was not working when i was there - i was secretly glad - but the little diver figurines were cute and made a nice semi-modernist wall pattern, throw in a few faucets and maybe a roll of toilet paper and voila! marcel duchamp!), smiling hostesses and general perkiness. maybe it was the family of a thousand with all those kids and mommy talk that tilted my perception as i came through the door. but it's really not important though.if you're old or infirm, don't go. there is an elevator, but the access is from outside and through the homeless - i mean harmony - atrium, and it drops you in the storage areas of the backstage part of the restaurant and you either feel like migrant labor applying for work or pinkie ring cladded wiseguys wending past the laundry carts to finally emerge from the maze into the main area, a very welcome sight. it takes some of the luster off the minks and chinchillas you might be wearing for the evening's performance at lincoln center -- actually, the hostesses did ask, without prompting, if we had a performance, which puzzled me at first: i automatically assumed there was some sort of floor show you could buy with your meal, given the disneyesque atmosphere, but then i realized they were just being helpful in case we had to make an early curtain across the street -- anyway, to get to the main dining room you have to trudge up the equivalent of two flights of stairs, so a few patrons could be seen huffing and puffing.so you might be a little winded by the time you get there, but it is a beautiful and exciting environment with deep colors and big windows and a sense of wide open views. classy and rich looking. sets you up nicely for the meal. the chinchilla will be saying, ""if i wasn't dead, i'd be really into this place.""food was great, hands down. and isn't that why you come? slightly creative takes on what would normally be working class mexican fare, the difference being the quality of ingredients. choice meats, finely tuned sauces, fresh and pungent everything, careful cooking. the service is absolutely wonderful. when we left we were escorted through the whole shebang to the elevator, and the guy patiently waited until it came and we stepped in. he said, simply, goodbye. we waved as the door slid closed.the guacamole got big big points, one for flavor, it was simply delicious, and one for not making a circus out of the fact that the waiter scoops and mixes it all up on a stand not too far away. i mean, there was no flaming kazmarovs or sound effects or sparklers, and he didn't wheel the cart right up to the table and do tricks with the knives so we could get all slackjawed and giggle at each other and call omaha to tell them about this crazy crazy place. if you happened to look over, you could see he was making your guac, fresh, right over there, but you could also keep talking to your dinner companion if you chose, and that was a very classy aspect to the experience. in fact the whole thing, once we got past the reception, was classy and elegant. maybe that's why it cost so damn much - two people, three drinks, the guac, two plates and coffees: $120 bazongas!! then again, the opera tickets, had we owned any, would have been three times that. i guess we were just getting caught in their tailwind. or maybe you have to charge solid gold prices so the people with solid gold won't be scared to eat mexican.as for the main event, the drinks were blah - frozen margerita seemed more like a slushee - but the short ribs were luscious and the carne asada taco was equally brilliant. and like good mexican, when it was over and we had put our napkins on the table and surrendered, half the meal still remained on the plate and the other half sat in our stomachs like piles of lead.ahh, fine dining at its best!",3,5,5,Brave G.,"New York, NY",181,243,62

The food was absolutely delicious. The infamous guacamole was as good as we had heard. The beauty lies in the presentation. The server makes the guacamole right at your table. It's ridiculously fresh and tasty. My boyfriend had the Taco de Pollo Asado (basically Chicken Fajitas) while I ordered the Mixiote de Borrego (Lamb shank marinated in tequila and chiles. Slow-cooked in parchment paper and served with salsa verde and fresh corn tortillas).

They are known for several things -- the guacamole is one. I come here for the guacamole. Never mind that it's $14. It's frickin AWESOME. Secondly, they love touting their pomegranite margarita, but a caution with this one: PASS on the drink. The margarita's are overpriced and WAY too sweet (even for people I know with a serious sweet tooth). The pomegranite flavor gets lost along the way and it makes you wonder why you spent that much cash on it. Stick with either some wine or a beer. It's Mexican, after all -- beer is so appropriate.Dish-wise, in my last outing, the enchiladas de jaiba were excellent. Loved the sauce, with just the right amount of kick, and the crab was had a lovely taste. The real dish of the day was the filete con hongos. The mushroom-tequila sauce was just unbelievable.

3.0,4/16/2006,"Rosa is ok. I believe it's hard to find great Mexican cuisine in NYC (and I am not sure why that is) but Rosa doesn't live up to my standards for Mexican. The gaucamole is very tasty and has a fun element to the dining experience. I like how they make it at the table and it's so easy to make (very basic). It's probably the best and most popular aspect on the menu. The tacos are good and greasy and the crab meat enchiladas are very good, flavorful. The portions are decent, the atmosphere has a great vibe, and the service is good as well. But, nothing is special about this place and I am still looking for good Mexican in the city. Rosa is not a place I would go back to over and over again.",1,0,0,Jen L.,"New York, NY",183,268,0
4.0,3/15/2006,"I went for margaritas and guacamole and was pleased with both.  They weren't kidding about the guac being spicy, as the guy smashed a handful of jalapenos into the mix.  We watched him make it, which is always fun.  The pomegranate margaritas were delicious.",1,0,0,Susannah R.,"San Francisco, CA",44,98,0
4.0,1/14/2006,The waiting was not the issue but the fact that there are only 8 tables in the entire restaurant for 2 people. The menu in comparison to Dos Caminos was broader and the food was very comparable. So bring your friends if you want to get seated faster & enjoy a nice new atmosphere in the Flatiron area.,0,0,0,Chinku G.,"Hicksville, NY",21,541,0
4.0,9/23/2005,"Strong pomegranate margaritas and terrific guacamole, fresh from the cart.  Funky decor with a water wall, with sculptured little divers stretching up to the second level.  Very small bar area, not quite the place to lounge.   Food is very good, perfect for a stylish dinner before the Opera and Lincoln Center across the street.  The rose petals imbedded in the windows also add to a sexy vibe...   If you order the massive sundae during the ice cream festival, make sure you call for reinforcements.",1,0,0,Mariana L.,"New York, NY",362,606,196
5.0,9/18/2005,"This spacious Lincoln Center dining spot, highlighted by a thirty-foot-tall blue tile waterfall adorned with hundreds of sculpted divers, has a menu that's as delicious as its decor is delightful. It is here that the now common practice - in upscale eateries, at least - of preparing guacamole tableside using the freshest ingredients allegedly originated. The only complaint is that no matter how spicy you request it, they always serve a toned-down version. The ceviche starter with citrus-marinated mahi mahi has the bite the guacamole is missing. Enchiladas de jaiba - corn tortillas filled with lump crabmeat and topped with pumpkin seeds and tomatillo sauce - is a winner. All the desserts are decadent, especially the tres leches de chocolate, chocolate rum cake topped with vanilla ice cream and served with sugared bananas. Friends who drink seem to order the famous frozen pomegranate margaritas as frequently as I ask for refills of water.",0,0,0,Gourmet G.,"San Francisco, CA",99,2099,2099
