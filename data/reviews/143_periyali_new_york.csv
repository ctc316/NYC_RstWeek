5.0,3/8/2019,Fish specials and the octopus are the jam. Nice quite dining room and decent wine selection. It's a professional place with nice service although sometimes the bus boys are a little rush-y taking your plate when not everyone is finished. It's a great quality food spot. Go for the fish special over the prix fixe. Def don't miss the octopus,0,0,0,Delphine L.,"New York, NY",71,28,0
1.0,3/3/2019,"I had a less than average meal at Periyali a couple weeks ago. The appetizers tasted like they came from a frozen package (spanikopita and zucchini fritters), the salad was fine and I had to spit out some of the chicken kebab because it was sinewy and I was worried it was actually raw. Even worse, the pen they gave me to sign my check    had a leak which got all over my hands and ruined my wallet AND handbag. They deny all of this saying they have security footage of me signing my check (they do not) that shows the pen was fine. A bad $60 dinner cost me almost $2000 in damages. Bad customer service and rude management. AVOID.",0,0,0,Ariel A.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,2,0

My friend really just wanted humus so we just got this trio dip thing and oh my gosh it was delicious. It was a trio of fish dip, humus, and an eggplant, I believe. The pita bread was toasted and yummy! It is a classy place and would definitely recommend a friend to take someone out on a date here. OR you can just do what I did. I love Greek food and you really can't go wrong with Greek. Well, nowadays, you can, but they didn't.",0,0,0,Alice R.,"Manhattan, NY",10,111,4
5.0,2/10/2019,We absolutely loved this restaurant! Service was outstanding. Our server had been there over 30 years! Food was delicious. We got the humus- so delicious and garlicky-The Octopus was a huge portion and so tasty. The shrimp appetizer was great and so flavorful. And the mushroom app was delicious. The space is beautiful. They have fresh flowers throughout. Really surprising lovely meal at this little neighborhood restaurant. Already made a reservation to come back!,0,0,0,Nicole G.,"Philadelphia, PA",57,6,1

5.0,1/13/2019,"What a wonderful surprise!  I've passed by this restaurant so many times during the last few years.  I wish I discovered this place sooner!Periyali serves up refined classic Greek fare in a warm, friendly, and festive environment.  The restaurant is perfect for a family celebration or a date.  Service is also incredibly attentive!  We decided to share the Spanakopita, Tiropita, Kolokithokeftedes and Fava Kremidaki for our first course.  The delicious pie and fritter medley was served with a generous helping of mixed greens.  Best bring your appetite!  Make sure to dip your pita and/or bread in the high quality olive oil provided at the table (in addition to the tasty yellow split pea purée).For main courses, we selected the Grilled Branzino and Mosharaki Sharas Rigani, Agriomanitaria (whoa that's a complicated way to describe veal medallions!).  The Branzino was simply prepared, with good taste and texture.  The Veal Medallions were the highlight of my evening!  I really dig the use of oregano and spices.  Order this dish medium-rare.For dessert, we opted for the Walnut Cake - which is served with a giant scoop of homemade pistachio ice cream.  Although I am lactose intolerant, I had more than my fair share of this decadent plate.We had a terrific evening at Periyali.  The meal was well paced and the cuisine is reminiscent of a classic home cooked meal.  This restaurant lived up to its storied culinary history.",0,0,0,Matt M.,"Manhattan, NY",35,79,200

4.0,11/14/2018,"Yelp review  Periyali (Greek) 35 West 20th street/ Manhattan. 4 stars.My friend and an I found many wonderful positive points in Periyali , such as-I. ServiceContrary to some reviewers, we found the owner to be extremely helpful, concerned, graceful and polite. Our table alone was served with at least six staff members -verities of ethnic, age and gender- who volunteered frequently to accommodate our dining experience.  The owner came at least twice -to express his care. It was very easy to receive the attention of the servers. Indeed, the service was perfect.We did not feel being pushed to order any specific dishes; the staff recommends dishes -only when asked- e.g. their specialty - e.g. octopus. II. Ambiance Modern, tasteful ambiance, light white and blue motif, comfortable seats -plenty of space between tables- allowed conversations - business, romantic, as well as family gathering.  III. Authentic Greek and special dishesThe rich menu includes many special Greek maze , Mediterranean, semi-exotic dishes such as: Moussaka, Octopus, Quail, Rabbit Stew, regular Greek appetizers, lamb dishes (shank and chops) , verities of fish (-cooked Greek styles -as well as poached, steamed, barbequed, fried, or baked in a phyllo pastry [similar to Russian Kulebyaka ].Available also are beef-chicken (liver and Grilled)-veal, pasta, raw seafood, as well as vegetarian for those who do not want to try unknown ethnic dishes. Many dishes are garnished with spinach and Greek feta cheese. IV. DrinksFresh fruit juices, beers, good selection of wine and hard liquor, and tab- water served -refilled frequently.  Varieties of tea flavor and coffee are offered.V. On our specific experience -one visitWe ordered the following dishes:1. Octopus -excellent, peerless2. Quail -satisfactory3. Calamari - satisfactory4.  Selections of appetizers: fish caviar with olive oil, eggplant mixture, and tzatzika (cream-yogurt family) salad.5.  Grilled Branzino -whole Greek fish- satisfactory.Note: Due to a previous arrangement - we did not order dessert; the dessert dishes on display looked very good. The size of serving was generous -served with extra veggies.VI. ConclusionA wonderful restaurant - the service, ambiance, varieties of dishes- especially octopus - good for business, family and romantic encounter.Still the best fish and Sashimi - as well as super service - are found at Ab Sushi, 11 West 36th street.Please note this rating is due to only one visit.",0,0,0,Parviz M.,"Manhattan, NY",0,47,1

1.0,10/21/2018,"This is an example of how not to treat a customer. We ordered moussaka and two lamb dishes. The lamb dishes were Gamey FYI. When the moussaka came it was cold. I asked to have it heated. 20 minutes passed and my family had finished their meals so I ended up eating their leftovers. When the moussaka finally arrived they said it was complimentary. I asked to pack it since I ate my daughter's leftovers. When the bill came I was charged for 2 moussakas. I questioned this and was told I had eaten some of the first moussaka and packed up the second. I told them to keep the packed one since I was told i would not be charged and told them I had 2 bites of the first one but it was cold and unpleasant to eat. The manager huffed and then the bill was fixed and the 2 moussakas removed. I walked out with the packed up moussaka and the waiter asked me to leave it. This is unbelievable. I was going to ignore that we ordered a bottle of wine and 1/2 glass was poured to taste it and then we noticed the glass was chipped. The waiter took the glass with the wine and brought a new glass only. He said nothing about wasting our wine.

4.0,9/3/2018,"Met up with a friend and thought you can't go wrong with Greek any night of the week. Walked in and shown to our table right away. I was surprised by the amount size of the restaurant. There was plenty of open tables, but not for long. Luckily they gave us a table for 4 even though there were only two of us. Once you start ordering you'll need the space. The prix fixe is def the way to go. For $42 you get three courses (I had the octopus - 8 extra but it's their specialty and totally worth it, salmon baked in phyllo dough, and there's no choice for the desert but it was a moist and delicious cake. Everything I tasted was full of bold Mediterranean flavor. The service was also very attentive with plenty of hands on deck for each table to be sure you have everything you need. My only hesitation was that there seemed to be no set wine list. I always appreciate a server who can take your preferences and provide a recommendation, but I also like to see the options and perhaps the prices.

4.0,7/27/2018,"There for lunch during Restaurant Week. Two course meal was $26. Plentiful appetizer portions and selections included meatballs, soup of the day, light salads with pita, to name a few. For the main course I had filet of grilled bass and it was excellent -- flaky, moist, perfectly seasoned and a generous portion size. Others in my party had the moussaka. It was good but a little heavy for a hot afternoon. Lovely interior. The front portion of the restaurant is dark during the day but go toward the back where skylights let in filtered sunlight.

5.0,6/29/2018,"OUR FAVORITE GREEK. Absolutely the best Greek restaurant in Manhattan and has been for at least the 25 years we've been coming. While we've never had a complain about anything, last night everything was just a little better than usual. Start with a selection of middle eastern appetizers, including giant beans, grilled octopus, meatballs, pureed fava beans with onions. Then have either kebobs or lamb chops.....we like them slightly under-cooked. Staff is delightful. The room is simple and well designed, the crowd upscale. We love it here.

3.0,5/27/2018,"I thought the service was exceptional and the vibe very date night or special family dinner atmosphere. The food was tasty and quality so so but nothing impressive. I was a little underwhelmed eventhough I enjoyed my meals I didn't think it was something I couldn't cook at home. Honestly I could probably grill a really good expensive cut of fish and make steamed veggies and sides - does this make sense?If anything this wasn't elevated. This just felt like good home cooking (grandma style) so take your Grammy here or you pops to enjoy a nice expensive meal in a nice looking restaurant. Our server was attentive. I did enjoy the wine (locally sourced imported Greek wine - catch 22 there!). I wouldn't go back. It's overpriced I would rather go to the tavernas in nyc and be wowed over simple kebab plates and grilled octopus. I had the octopus although soaked in red wine and super soft and chewy, I didn't get the crispy char that grilled octopus typically is served in Greece (For the record I've been to Greece a few times and have yet to find a beautiful octopus here...the closest is Kiki in LES) if anyone knows please tell me or take me!The main - I think it was a seared fish - branzino? Super buttery and flaky served with a side of couscous (more butter) and broccolini. A bit too oily. When the quality of the ingredients are good you shouldn't have to soak in oil and butter...We skipped the overpriced dessert as they had a display in the entrance of what they offered (that's tacky in many places...turned me off immediately)If anything this place has potential...just needs elevated plates and ideas. Offer less items, keep it simple and focus on ingredients just like in Greece please.",0,0,0,Sarah Z.,"Manhattan, NY",33,44,19
1.0,5/25/2018,Everything was mediocre for the $$. I ordered the chicken kababs which had 4 little Kababs on a plate of couscous. It should have been described as couscous with a garnish of chicken. $25.00. Extremely expensive for the average quality.,0,0,0,Diane C.,"San Francisco, CA",0,9,0

The mains were a good portion size. Unimaginative and plain mains, but solid, tasty dishes. I liked the dim lighting though it's hard to read menus. Negatives - our round table was too small. Plates and glasses covering the entire table, a mess. The wait staff seemed harried, stressed and were rude. The head waiter was nice but the other guys running around just scowled and did their best to avoid eye contact. They ran out of the branzino by 8pm on a Saturday night which I thought was pathetic given it's one of their signature dishes. It was also very noisy and that took away from our group's enjoyment.

Definitely want to try again!! we added the famous appetizer--squid (I forget the name), it's delicious,especially with the lemon sauce. The main courses are ok.

1.0,10/29/2017,"Unfortunately, another restaurant that seems to perform well when they're not taxed, and falls apart when they're busy. This review concerns a Friday night.  We had a reservation, and were seated promptly.  Our ""waiter"" came over, asked us about water, and brought us olives.  He took drink orders and pushed the octopus (which we've had before.  It's good).Ten minutes later, the drinks arrived. So did he.  No bread.  Other tables got bread.  Not us.  He ran through a list of specials.  And folded his arms.  We had to order.  NOW.  We didn't want the octopus and I guess that was a problem for him, because after we ordered squid, beans, chicken and halibut, he disapeared, never to return. The calamari was delcious, the beans were not.  Underseasoned, with a BURNING garlic sauce on the side.  They got pushed away at the table.  After 40 minutes, someone picked them up.  No one asked about it. No one came back to ask about second drinks.  Still no bread.  Aftre 50 minutes, out comes overcooked chicken, and halibut under so much lemon juice it was inedible, and cauliflower that would make grammar school steam table look good .  Again, not touched.  Can't talk to the waiter, because he disappeard.  Twenty minutes later, we ask the busboy if he can clear and bring us the check. Again, no one asks about dessert, no one asks about coffee, no one asks about so much uneaten food.  Not even the useless manager who seemed more interested in showing regulars his jacket and texting.    I  SWEAR, we almost didn't tip, for the first time in our restaurant going lives.

For appetizer, my husband and I shared the spanakopita, tiropita, kolokithokeftedes - it was spinach pie, cheese pie, and zucchini fritter.  There were 2 of each, so it was perfect for sharing.  Everything was great, but the spanakopita was definitely the best!  For dinner I was excited to order the Grilled Branzino (whole fish or filet - I went with the filet) served grilled, with olive oil and lemon juice.  The fish was cooked and prepared to PERFECTION.  NO bones, perfectly flaky and delicious.  I could eat that every night.  It was served with rice which I think had onions and herbs in it? Not too sure, but it was delicious.  For dessert, we shared an order of Baklava - which came with 3 pieces.  I'm extraordinarily picky about baklava since I make my own (and I must say, it's DAMN GOOD) it was great! A bit sweet and the bottom was slightly soggy with honey, but I think that's more to do with the terribly humidity They only had wine available by the bottle, and since not all of us were drinking, we didn't want to pop open an entire bottle.  I didn't mind too much, but it would have been nice to have a single glass of white with dinner.Overall, very cute place - the menu had some variety and everyone seemed to enjoy their meal! My husband ordered the lamb shank, which I tried, and it was so delicious and fall-off-the-bone-tender!  I also tried the Greek Salad (or Horiatiki Salata), the feta was phenomenal, the tomatoes and cucumbers were definitely Greece-level-good!   In the end, I went with 4 stars versus 5 due to service.  I would understand if it were a Friday/Saturday night and there was a wait, but it was late on a Tuesday and the waiters weren't the friendliest.  Saying that, I know this place is somewhat of a NYC institution, I'm not worried it'll disappear anytime soon!

It's a very crisply designed ambiance. The food is simple, but delicious (Finally a menu where you can tell what you're getting based on the ingredients they list!).  I tried the salad, Greek meatballs, charred octopus and the Garides Psites (grilled shrimp entree with pilaf and sauteed vegetables). The octopus was so good - highly recommend. I also loved the shrimp entree. My biggest gripe about many Greek restaurants is that they usually just rely on a decadent white sauce to provide the flavoring.

3.0,6/18/2017,"I would have rated Periyali higher if it wasn't for my recent experience which left much to be desired, particularly their service. I felt it all went downhill once they produced a Horiatiki Greek salad with feta cheese and we clearly stated no cheese. The waiter didn't seem too happy to find out he was wrong. Afterward, we didn't see him anymore and the service was MIA. We were pretty much left to our own devices. We even ordered a bottle of sparkling and still water, and it was not fulfilled. I don't know how voicing the order was ignored, but luckily they didn't charge us for it. The selection of fish here was very limited compared to Milos and Limani, but their food was always consistently good. My favorite being their orange cake. So aromatic and savoring every bite makes me one happy diner. I would give them a chance again, perhaps this was an off night for their service.",0,0,0,Kiki L.,"Manhattan, NY",0,38,0

The feta was served on red peppers, and even as someone who doesn't enjoy red peppers, I found them to be very tasty. A horiatiki is always a solid choice for me--had very large hunks of feta in it, yum. Mezze platter had three different ""dips"" on it, taramosalata, a caviar mousse, melitzanosalata, grilled eggplant puree, and tzatziki sald. The eggplant puree was delightfully garlicky. Tzatziki was solid. And the taramosalata taught me that I like caviar mousse, which I wasn't suspecting. And moussaka for an app? Why not!? Super yummy.I was slightly less impressed with the entrees. I ordered the garides psites, which was grilled shrimp with rice pilaf and sauteed vegetables. The shrimp were tasty, but the rice pilaf was pretty bland. My boyfriend ordered the souvlaki fileto, which was a filet mignon shish kebab. It wasn't anything mind blowing, but certainly quite tasty.",0,0,0,Katie B.,"Brooklyn, NY",144,220,20

They understood on the phone, but were completely confused when we arrived. We were told ""it's jet lag, don't mind him"" when the head waiter seemed annoyed that we wanted a table large enough to accommodate all of us. Food was just ok, nothing outstanding. A waiter spilled sauce on my husband's back... again, no apology. They turned off the AC because friends of the owners were chilly.

SO the dining room is fine, maybe not as comfortable as we would have liked. Service was OK but maybe a little blunt. They also overcharged us for one item so we had to get them to correct that. The main complaint was the food. Everything was average to less than average. The meatballs were decent. My grilled chicken was good, but salty. The consensus was that there were mistakes made on the dishes, from being overly salty, to being under-spiced, overcooked, etc.Basically we didn't like the food that much. And that was confounded by a horrible standard dessert. They were BAD.Anyways, we won't go back, but maybe you should give this place a chance.

It happen to be next to an old man who was filing his nails. After the initial unsettling disgust of an old man eating alone and filing his nails as a part of eating dinner experience everything went better. The restaurant is clean, modern authentic Greek look, and staff is a mix of authentic Greek and Asian servers. The bus staff will constantly ask you if you are done.

Our waiter was nice and eager to help us. There was a pre-fixe menu which we opt to ignore. There are plenty of better dishes to try. The table ordered around of appetizer to start. No Greek dinner goes without a plate of grilled octopus which was super tender and slightly charred was very good. The meatballs was firm but not mushy. The selection of spanakopita too try. I had the lamb shank over orzo. The grilled chicken was really flavorful. The grilled Branzino fillet was moist and fresh. The salmon in filo dough was equally good. Flaky shell and moist fish inside.  The dessert was equally as good. We went with the orange cake, walnut cake and rice pudding.The casual atmosphere was quite ambiance was a great place to have a conversation. Our water always was filled when needed.

1.0,2/15/2016,"My boyfriend and I have a mutual love for Greek food. This year for Valentine's Day we decided to try a new Greek restaurant in the city. We had heard about the restaurant on Facebook in an article about ""the top Greek restaurants in NYC"" which showed us beautiful images of this restaurant. My boyfriend made a reservation 3 weeks prior to Valentine's day to make sure we had a nice table. When we got there an obnoxious scent of flowers was the only thing that we could smell. It literally smelt like a funeral service. I didn't smell any food at all and there were tables surrounding us with food. We were greeted by an extremely nice hostess who offered to take our coats and have us seated right away although we were 10 minutes early. She immediately got her manager to seat us. Living in New York for my entire life I can pinpoint an arrogant New Yorker in a second. That is exactly what this manager was. My boyfriend and I are in our early twenties and I guess he figured we were not going to spend that much money. He said ""Hi. You can sit at a table or you can sit at the bar since that is probably more fun."" More fun? Sitting at a tiny bar next to the door that kept opening all night? No thanks. We politely asked to be seated at a table. Mind you, it was 7:20 and the entire restaurant (excluding one of the three rooms) was completely empty. Without giving us any options what-so-ever we were seated at a table that looked more like a table for 1, under a GIANT bouquet of obnoxiously smelling flowers that were basically sitting in my boyfriends lap and hanging on the table over our heads. HORRIBLE. I was choking from the smell of the flowers so we asked to have our table switched. The waitress was the only saving grace of the entire experience since she was extremely nice and always on top of everything. She asked the manager to switch our table and he (while being annoyed) asked if moving next to another couple was better for us. Anything was better than sitting with the flowers. We moved to a table that was a half booth on one side. Again, the majority of the restaurant was empty but we were crammed next to another couple who I might as well have asked their names because I was practically sitting on top of them. The tables were so close I could hear their entire conversation. Lets get to the food- appetizers were okay. The grilled octopus was not the best I've ever had but I enjoyed it. We got three different spreads with pita bread which we had the same reaction to (not the best but ok). For the main course I got the lamb shank with orzo and tomatoes which has been my favorite greek entree at every other Greek restaurant we have gone to and my boyfriend got lamb chops. He said his lamb chops were okay but not the best. My lamb shank had the most disgusting smell as soon as it was placed in front of me. The way I described it was ""musty"" it almost tasted as if I were eating dust. My boyfriend thought I was being dramatic and tasted it. He agreed that it had a funky taste and begged me to order something else but after eating dust I decided to pass. The lamb was gamy and the tomato sauce tasted as if it came out of a can. Horrible. Dessert was nothing to die for. The orange cake I ordered tasted like a plain pound cake that I could get at a supermarket and everything else was just meh. Trying to make light of the situation and actually enjoy our Valentine's day we made the best of the experience. As we were talking amongst ourselves I looked over to see a older couple walk in. They had no reservation and the woman was wearing a fur vest with heels. They had money written all over them and the manager could definitely tell. He ran up to them offering them any table in the house. He sat them at a table of four next to us and immediately gave them bread and olives. Why didn't I get olives? Because I wasn't wearing a fur coat? To top it off....at the end of the night more tables were empty and the couple that we were practically sitting on top of left. My boyfriend came around the table and sat next to me so that we could take a picture together before we left. The waitress was extremely nice taking our picture but rudely and annoyingly enough the manager came over and interrupted ""sorry guys, you wouldn't mind? I have to sit this couple."" The table next to us was empty, the table next to that was empty anddddd the table next to that was empty. He had to pick this table!? By that point I was excited to get the hell out of there. We put on our coats and were leaving. The only one that said goodnight was the waitress. The manager stood at the hostess's booth and never said a word. Thank you for coming! Nope....Goodnight! Nope.... He said NOTHING. We will neverrrrrrr be returning to this restaurant and will stick to the amazing Greek restaurants that we already know.

When my date and I first arrived, we were greeted by the hostess and had our coats taken for coat check. We ordered some wine from their comprehensive wine list - we recommend the Oeno white wine. Here are my recommendations for appetizers and entrees:Recommendations:Octopus - Although the octopus portion was small, the sauce was citrus-y and savory. The octopus itself was cooked perfectly - not chewy at all. Lamb Chops- I asked for medium rare and got medium rare. The lamb chops ate like steak but had the slightly gamier flavor of lamb.Moussakas- The best way to describe this dish is Greek Lasagna. Basically, a wonderful mix of dough, cheese, and ground lamb meat.All and all, I would recommend this restaurant who wants a taste of traditional Greek food.",1,0,0,Sean C.,"Long Island City, NY",215,123,80
4.0,1/19/2016,"A mid-week dinner, 8 of us at a round table celebrating the end of a very intense two-day summit, some of us clearly with deeper pockets than others. One of our diners was married to a Greek girl, and he took over and decided to order up the menu for all of us. Well, basically, he  ordered just about everything on the menu for appetizers while picking out a good few $50-$75 bottles of wine. Like others have said, the grilled octopus was a huge, huge hit among us; glad we got 2 of those to share. He then let us pick our individual main dishes (I chose the branzino - a type of European sea bass -  which was filleted and de-boned and so simple and good). By the time we finished up the dessert (the rice pudding was my fav, sorry baklava!), our bill with tip came out to about $100 a person.Service was on point with a very attentive team whisking away plates as we emptied them.When we first arrived, the noise level was quite reasonable, but the room did get louder as more guests arrived.

4.0,1/3/2016,"Went here with a large group of people. The main waiter we had was excellent. The bus boys messed up a few times (filled one of the people's waters with ice instead of plain consistently) but were fine as well. He also recommended a good bottle of wine as well, I think it was in the 60$ range and it was a 50% mix of Assyrtiko (Greek astringent white) and Sauvignon blanc. The wine was solid. Fruity and a bi sour with some smokiness (I guess from the Greek white.) Someone else got a beer, they had Mythos, Heineken, and Duvel, which isn't bad compared to your usual Greek offerings. Anyway though this is about the food, not the alcohol.A large number of people went with the (38 dollar?) prix fixe menu. They allowed a substitution for lentil soup over some of the other choices which was nice. I guess it was the same price as the avologlomeno soup or something.They brought out an assortment of bread beforehand which included what seemed to be akin to a baguette, another white bread, and a darker loaf which was as usual my preference. The olive oil they served was good.We started with appetizers.(Me) Oktapodi Sharas: (The much raved) Greek OctopusI can see why everyone loves this so much. It's probably one of if not the best octopus I've had in the city thus far. Perfectly tender. Lemony sauce on the bottom was delicious. Well worth it. 4.8.Fakes: Lentil soup (special, I think 4/5 of us,)I tried. Higher quality than most other places, a bit cool. Won't rate as I barely tried it.Horitaki: Greek Salad Didn't try, portion looked fine, especially the feta.Keftedakia Saltsa: Greek Meatballs: Didn't try, looked good.Mains:(Me) Arni Youvetsi: Lamb shank over orzo with a red sauce. The sauce reminded me of Lamb Kokinisto from other places, i.e. a sauce of mostly tomatoes and a bit of cinnamon. Pretty generous portion of lamb, well for a fancy restaurant. Fell off the bone with just a fork. Frankly could have used a spoon to take it off. I also took some of, what I guess could be considered bone marrow from the shank and that was good as well (new food trend anyone?) The orzo was cooked properly and the sauce was better balanced than in other places I've been to. Solid. 4.4Souvlaki Kotupoulo: I.E. Grilled chicken with onions.Tried some of the onions and a very little bit of chicken. Flavors were fine. Nice amount of lemon and a good char. Otherwise, I would recommend something else as the flavors were a bit boring and the portion was small. 3.4.Kouneli Stifado: I.E. Rabbit in a red sauce with pearl onions. Tried a little bit of it, the white/dark meat. If you want to know, it tasted a bit like turkey though with some interesting textures to it. The sauce looked like a lighter version of my sauce though it didn't contain cinnamon and was a bit sweet. 3.2. I guess this dish is traditional but I wasn't a bit fan of it (now sue me)Lemoni Patatas/Potatoes:Was a side dish for 10 bucks. Not worth it. Small portion and not much lemon/otherwise. I'd recommend a different side all together. The menu lists it as potatoes which makes sense as there was no lemon in said potatoes. 2.2Grilled Branzino: I.E. wait, no need.Didn't try, he liked it. Solomos Exohiko: I.E. Salmon SpanakopitaDidn't try, he liked it (deja vu) though he said the portion was a bit small.Dessert: Some people got tea also.Instead of a dessert menu, he came out with the same plate for everyone for the new year so we got dessert for free, nice though I would have preferred some of the other desserts. But who's to complain when it's free?Kourabiedes: Butter/almond cookiePretty solid variation. Single one of these. Nice and crumbly. I would have ordered these solely if I was just ordering from the menu. Try it by dipping into coffee or tea. Texture is designed for that. 4.2. I've had better at a Greek place in Cobble Hill as well as at various Greek Bakeries (Poseidon among others.)Karithopita (I'm assuming) Walnut spice cakeThe other versions I have had before were a bit sweeter. It was OK, slightly dry but flavorful.. 3.7Yiaourtopita (I'm assuming:) Lemon cake (made with yogurt, never knew:)I have not had this before so I cannot compare. Was a light lemon cake. Passable. 3.5The appetizers were quite strong, the main dishes were mostly good, and the desserts were passable. Food was solid. I might go back but the prices are a bit high for the quality of the dishes. Something around an upper 3.If I solely had the octopus and my main dish, I would be giving this a 4.3 however.

Waited over 45 minutes between removal of our appetizer dishes and the entrees.

We pretty much ordered one of every appetizer option, which did not disappoint. Everything was so fresh and delicous, and the pita bread was heavenly. I orderd a greek salad with grilled octopus on top and it was perfect. The octopus was perfectly cooked, nice and crispy on the outside and juice on the inside.

5.0,6/1/2015,"Delicious is all I can say! This is real Greek food to me, fresh fish cooked to perfection. its a beautiful room, romantic fresh flowers, lovely upscale vibe. Make sure you have a reservation its small so they are busy as most good restaurants are. I usually have the Branzino they will take it off the bone if you are like me and want the result of it cooked on the bone but don't like an eye staring back at you, ask for the waiter to debone it, not a problem. Wait staff are pros, no issue here ever. I had the appetizer of mixed little Greek sides with pita bread, it was delightful, as I like a little of this and a little of that. Suited me just fine. My friend loves the grilled octopus and the sauce they put on it, I am allergic to shell fish and its a fine like if that's shell fish or not so would rather not take the chance. Whatever I order here comes out perfect, I am not that adventurous because of my allergy limitations but the people I go with are and it looked delicious. Never disappointed  at Periyali, they cook their food to perfection, the room is lovely and romantic but its a bit pricy. Hey what isn't in NYC at  least the food is good, nothing worse then pricy and bad food. On my list of go back to restaurants and  I get excited about dining here, that's a good thing.

1.0,5/18/2015,"I have NEVER been treated so poorly in a restaurant. Food was good, service was not (mediocre, but that did not bother me too much).We went to Periyali for a birthday party (20people on 3 tables), meaning that we spent about $1500 altogether.After we paid, the waiter came and yelled at us saying that we were $60 short.We apologized and checked, everyone paid, so we asked him to check.I came back and said that that we were still $20 short, we objected he was wrong and did the math with him. He could not even do the math (I quote, ""You paid 190 and 190 its 360 plus 120 it is 440, so you owe me $60"" (check was $500). Someone wanted to calm things down and give him $20 in cashWe asked to see the credit cards receipt which he replied ""No, I am keeping them until you pay the money missing"".We spent 10 min arguing and I started loosing my nerves and asked, again, to see the receipts of our card. We found out that one card  was not charged the full amount we asked to pay because the part of the check was a %20(!!) included gratuity could not be processed.In which the waiter claimed ""You see, you could not pay the gratuity with your card, so I was right!"" Like we did try to explain that 190+190+120 doesn't equal 440 earlier, did I try to explain that it is possible to pay tips using the ""Tip"" area of a CC receipt: I was replied ""It is not possible"" (I am pretty sure it is).In the meantime, the manager  came stood there watching  with the other waiters surrounding us like if we were some kind of riots. Needless to say that we weren't given any apology from anyone. I believe that we should consider ourselves grateful to them for not kicking us out of their restaurant in the first place.By really far my worst experience ever in a restaurant.",3,0,0,Jean-Jacques D.,"Brooklyn, NY",2,23,0
1.0,5/16/2015,"Arrived at Periyali early for a bday dinner so I had a seat at the bar while I was waiting for the rest of my party to arrive. As I sat at the bar and perused the menu, I caught the end of an argument an elderly couple was having with the someone who appeared to be the manager. The couple was briskly walking towards the exit and a man was following them, trying to convince them to stay, and offering them a free meal. When the couple reached the doorway, the man turned around and said something to the effect of, ""I've been coming here for 25 years and I've never seen something like this. I'm never coming back here again."" Unsettling start to the night to say the least...When my friends and I were seated and the food was brought over we were pleasantly surprised to find that it was extremely good overall. The greek salad was legitimate greek salad. And by that I mean, there were no lettuce leaves added in as filler, as I've seen far too many American or ""Mediterranean"" restaurants do, the vegetables were fresh and the feta was delicious. The chicken souvlaki, the moussaka, and the meatballs were all very good as well. The reason I'm giving this place 1 star is because of the service. Our waiter wasn't very friendly throughout the entire meal, he barked at us for our orders and was grimacing the entire evening. Not a pleasant experience. However, the real issue arose when it came time to pay the bill. There were 8 of us at the table and we gave our waiter 3 credit cards, told him to charge the same amount for each one, and then had the only person who wasn't paying with a card leave his share in cash. We didn't expect this to be that complicated. The waiter returned to our table and told us we had underpaid, and still owed $60. We asked him to repeat what he'd charged each card and he couldn't tell us, went back to the register, and then came back and said we only underpaid by $20. This still didn't make any sense so we asked to see the bill and the credit card receipts. He was extremely reluctant to give us back our credit cards or show us the receipts. 15 minutes later we were still trying to understand why the math wasn't working out. The waiter remained adamant that we had underpaid and eventually we had to ask for a calculator and literally write it out for him. Out of 8 seasoned New Yorkers, with hundreds of restaurant visits between us, not a single person had ever experienced something so bizarre. Our waiter was either legitimately mentally challenged, or he was trying to rip us off. We asked for the manager but received no help from him. In the end we got the waiter to understand that we had indeed paid the bill in full. But the amount of time it took to accomplish this, combined with the extreme rudeness and overall awkwardness of the whole situation, was inexcusable. This was a real shame, because I genuinely liked the food and was going to bring my parents here when they visited the city. By the end of the night the actions of the waiter had convinced my entire table that Greeks were either crooks or simply didn't know how to manage their money (insert stale financial crisis joke here). This experience made me ashamed to be Greek.",3,0,0,Natty P.,"New York, NY",0,4,5
4.0,5/16/2015,"I was there this past Wednesday (5/13/15) for my best friend's girlfriend's birthday.When we got in we liked the quiet ambiance.The waiters attended to us frequently and were fine. The only small gripe was that they were kind of reckless with the water pouring. Trivial, but still a critique lolI didn't find the chairs too comfortable.We started off with bread and olive oil. Some of the bread was a little hard, but the olive oil was really good.Then we had octopus (small portion) and meatballs (about 5 small ones) as separate appetizers. The octopus (Oktapodi Sharas) was really soft and tasted great. The sauce that it came with was really good as well. I didn't even need a knife to cut through it. It might have even tasted a bit like steak. It was really good and the lemon made it even better. The meatballs (Keftedakia Saltsahad) had good texture and sat in a marinara sauce that had a good consistency. They were seasoned nicely and tasted pretty good.My friend and I had the braised lamb (Arni Youvetsi) on a bed of risotto for the main course and his girlfriend had a layered casserole (Mousakas) with ground lamb, eggplant, and bechamel sauce. The first thing I thought about when I saw the lamb was the Flintstones. It was pretty big. It was juicy, tender, and fell right off the bone. The risotto was pretty good too. My friend loved his. This was the second time he ordered it. He was there once before and had the same thing. His girlfriend liked her dish as well, but I didn't get that she was wowed with it. I didn't taste it because I can't stand eggplant. I don't care who cooks it.For dessert we had the Baklava. It was the perfect sweetness. My friend said he had it there before and it was much more sweet the last time. I hate when it's too sweet, but it was just right for my taste.It's slightly pricey, but we didn't have any liquor so the bill came out to about $130 for the 3 of us.

The bread and super fresh olive oil to start coupled with the decor  transported me back to Mykonos, 2 months and counting until I'm there again!!! Our waiter was efficient and very accommodating when I chose 2 different whites and asked for extra wine glasses for all so we could do a mini wine tasting. I ordered a blend from Santorini and an assyrtiko that was the hands down winner, #107, and #111 on the wine list. We decided to split a few appetizers:1. Oktapodi Sharas charcoal grilled, red wine marinated octopus. - generous portion and was probably the only dish that I thought was just OK.2. Horiatiki Salata salad of tomatoes, feta, cucumber, red onions, olives and oregano. - one of the better Greek salads I've had, the feta was fabulous.3. Keftedakia Saltsa greek meatballs stewed in tomato sauce. - great flavor and the sauce was perfect.4. Gigandes Skordalia giant white beans and garlic sauce. - this was my favorite, I love me some big beans!!For entrees I had the whole branzino which was very good, still not as good as at Extra Virgin but no one has come close to that. The rest of the table had the Solomos Exohiko wild salmon baked in phyllo with spinach which was a huge portion and excellent and the halibut which was a special.

I really worried that it would be overcooked and rubbery and considered ordering something safe like Greek meatballs but I'm so glad I didn't! For the main course, I ordered moussaka which was just delicious and the perfect portion! The eggplant was wonderfully cooked and the cheese was hot and melty. The perfect comfort food. My colleagues ordered the roast chicken and the salmon in phyllo dough and everyone really enjoyed their meals.I also ordered a cocktail but I have no idea what it's called.

The ambiance reminds you of a Mediterranean home in Santorini, but with an evening twist: soft lighting, elegant contemporary twist.Went here this past Friday evening, for a wine and food pairing event with my friend from the wine distribution industry, we had a charred octopus (octopedi Sharas) marinated in red wine..this first course we paired with Dougous Catharus 2013 Sauvignon.. A fruity zesty wine perfect for seafood. Second course was the Keftdakia Saltsa (Greek meatballs served in tomato sauce) was absolutely tender, and aromatic with spices. Paired with Dougous PDO Rapsani 2011 a delicious blend of earthy red vines.. Third course, we had the Chicken Livers over Lentil- the livers are well made, and still really juicy, it has it consistency intact and has this aroma as well like the meatballs, the lentils are well seasoned and perfectly balanced. And for the final dish, we had a grilled marinated medallions of veals with Horta and mushroom sauce.. The veal cut are on a larger size, so be prepared, it is tender and can be noted as brined from before., the Horta is filling yet it can feel heavy at times...

For her starter, my sister had the Spanakopita and Tiropita which were fine; followed by Mahi-Mahi very nice.  I had the trio of spreads -  Taramosalata, Melitzanosalata and Tzatiki - very good; followed by Kotopoulo Forno (roast chicken Greek style) served with some very good Lemon potatoes.Dessert was another trio - spiced cake, orange cake and an almond cookie.

5.0,12/13/2014,"The decor of this place transported me to the bleached white seaside villages and lazy summers of Greece. Think a lot of white in the dining room but warmed up with draped white material covering the ceiling which produced a cocooning effect. Shoals of fish in the shape of metal artwork darted over the walls. It was my first time dining here with friends who love it. The long dining room was pretty empty and a welcome respite. Service was friendly, attentive and unobtrusive. We all had the fixed-price menu which was good value. I started with the octopus which was sensational: full of flavour and tender.

They provided us with a private part of their beautiful restaurant - and the waiters just kept bringing out the food!!

4.0,10/20/2014,"The food is amazing. I had the grilled octopus and it was hands down one of the best octopus dishes I've ever had anywhere! I'd come back and order 2-3 of those just as a meal because they were that delicious. It was cooked to perfection and was packed with flavor. For my entree, I had the swordfish which was equally amazing. I love swordfish and have had it done poorly, averagely and now I can finally say outstandingly! The seasoning was fantastic and the swordfish wasn't overcooked so it wasn't tough at all. The only reason I had to knock off a star was because of our server: he just wasn't very nice or attentive nor did he like to listen. If we all had to repeat our choices twice or more, you probably should get your ears checked or perhaps pay more attention. Also, he rarely came back. He came to ask for drink orders, then food orders, then brought the food over and we had to go ask someone for the check.

4.0,9/14/2014,"WOW! So happy we stumbled on this place. Actually, we were dropped off in the Union Square area and wanted Greek food so we check Yelp and that's what led us here. You may have a hard time finding it if you're just wandering the streets because it's on 20th and there's construction over the entrance right now. But if you're in the area, stop in. We got there after the lunch crowd left so the place was not full and we got all attention paid to just us girls, yay! This place has a very nice ambiance and I immediately said, ""you could have a wedding reception here!"" It was so white and clean and they have a nice open space and huge bar. Your wedding guests would enjoy it, if you're having a wedding probably of 50-90 people.Onto the FOOD! I'm still thinking of the feta, the white beans and the mushroom dishes we had. Wow. They were cooked perfectly. We were praising the waiter and told him to tell the chef and he mentioned that the chef has been there for the entire time the restaurant was there which was 20 years. I found that to be amazing that the same chef was there, and still cooking with the same passion. The food was not at all tired. I wonder if they change up the menu or keep to the classics?

The place has a great ambiance and feel - it's a cozy, intimate setting. We had two appetizers: the horiatiki salata (salad containing tomatoes, cucumbers, and feta cheese), and a spanakopita plate (which also had a cheese pastry and zucchini fritter). Both were very good, especially the salad. For my entrée, I had moussaka. It tasted great, but the portion was huge. The same could be said for the other dishes at the table.

The place is small with white wooden tables and chairs.We decided to split appetizers so we had the grilled octopus, Greek salad and 4 different types of dips with our pita bread. Those dips included an eggplant dip, and olive oil with fish eggs, and a yogurt garlic dip with cucumbers. The 4th I can't remember. We had a delicious white wine to go with our meal.I must admit I never tried octopus in all my life but this appetizer was grilled so well I couldn't stop eating it!!For my main course I went with the salmon phyllo that had spinach inside along with a side of green beans. Needless to say it was very good and filling!!For dessert we shared baklava and strawberries. Our waiter brought us out a small glass of moscata to enjoy with it.It is not an overly fancy restaurant as I could tell by the restrooms-clean but nothing much else to it.

The chef there is really good at just highlighting and enhancing whatever is served on your plate. Like most Greek restaurants it's decorated in the white and ocean blue theme and I love it, always feels like you sitting outside when you actually on the sub ground level.

I came here this week because the two restaurants I wanted to go to were too crowded and you can easily get into Periyali most any time (this is a clue). After 10 minutes of trying to figure out who was our waiter, someone finally approached us with menus. I ordered a bottle of white wine which was whisked away, but twice during the meal I had to flag someone down to get refills. There are lots of waiters and staff walking around in their pretty uniforms, all busy doing something other than paying attention to the customers. The apps were good but 2 of the 3 the entrees were mediocre.The good features of the restaurant are the decor (you feel like you are in the 1990's again, but in a good way) and the volume (you can hear each other talk).The staff and food- not so great.

If I could zero stars I would.  Absolutely no excuse for the attitudinal manager/owner to be snippity with us.  The fool.  He should have complimentaried everything for us with live roaches marching across our table but insisted we pay for everything we consumed up until the point the roaches appeared!  The waiter couldn't do anything to help us.  The manager, he was the typical wise ass greek restaurant owner who will never see us again.  He was too cheap to comp us, so desperate to collect money for the wine and the appetizer plate, screaming about the entrees that were almost ready to come out.  The manager/owner of this place can sit down and enjoy his marching roaches on his plate and he can lovingly lick them from his fork.  Yuck.",0,0,0,Nutella H.,"Manhattan, NY",0,4,0

The place was very busy and, while we were seated fast, we did not get the menus or water until after some time has passed and someone noticed us sitting at the table with sad faces. Our waiter was nice, however, after taking our order, he never even once checked on us or how were were doing, and only after we finished and asked him for the check did he re-appear at our table. Our food was brought in and plates were taken by...someone else. I do not think an attentive waiter was too much to ask, especially if some of his functions were taken over by someone else! Now, to the food. For an appetizer, I ordered the grilled octopus and my husband had the fava bean dip with toasted pita bread. The octopus was very good, but the whole evening I was bugged with a question. The creature has eight arms, so it's only fair to assume that one small octopus can be evenly split into two portions, right...So why did my plate only had three pieces? Was my octopus injured in a fight with a lobster? Granted those arms are rather small, three of them is just not enough for an appetizer, I am sorry. The fava bean dip was very flavorful and  quantity-wise it topped the octopus dish.As to the entrees, there were not memorable at all. My husband's striped bass in tomato sauce had a rather prominent oregano-like flavor, so either the chef overdone it with the spice or the fish was just not fresh. The mousakas dish I ordered was clearly pre-made - the bechamel sauce (which supposed to be creamy and fairly soft) had a jello-like consistency. The string beans that came with the fish were overcooked. The trio of cakes that came for dessert was also just ok. My favorite of the three was the orange cake - surprisingly very light and moist. Granted the cost of the pre-fixed menu was fairly low, I think we had a nice dinner. People next to us seemed to enjoy themselves. I would sum up this place as a very nice, low key restaurant with no ""wow-factor"" to its food.",2,2,0,Darya C.,"Brooklyn, NY",4,64,5
3.0,7/18/2012,"I had a satisfying lunch here that I probably wouldn't have paid for myself. They offer a price fixed deal ($25 for lunch, I think). The backroom has a space with a skylight, making it bright and one wall is actually canvas, a beautiful backdrop of a worldmap, possibly hand painted. The octopus was cooked perfectly-not too rubbery-just rubbery enough! The calamari was crispy, crunchy and lightly fried. I really enjoyed the beet salad with both red and yellow beets. The meatballs were okay, probably better served with an Italian sauce. I had the striped bass and nice serving of fish in a garlicky tomato sauce. They served two greek desserts to finish the meal.

4.0,2/5/2012,"tl;dr Periyali is a delightfully quaint Greek restaurant with really handsome servers presenting a refreshing take on Greek food, which to me feels a lot like lemony Italian food. Highly recommended for a nice dinner that isn't meant to be too romantic - a good place to go with friends.---I came to Periyali after consulting the NYC Restaurant Week menu extensively, looking for a place that was nice-ish, but not too romantic. Periyali seemed to fit the bill, and it truly did. The food was also very tasty - we had a very enjoyable meal here tonight.The restaurant is artistically decorated in blues and whites, and one gets the summery feeling of a Greek villa facing the ocean even though it's freezing outside. The chairs are unassuming regular wooden frame chairs, but add nicely to the atmosphere.APPETIZERS-Octopus - 4/5This hyped up dish does perform to standards, although I believe the octopus might be a tad bit too hyped up (especially being Asian and having a lot of octopi growing up). They do something really interesting (marinade?) to the octopus so that it is NOT rubbery at all, which I've never seen in octopus dishes before. Kudos to the chef for figuring out how to do that! The flavor was great, but not astounding. However, at the server's recommendation we asked for more bread and used it to soak up the octopus juices, and BOY that was really tasty. The juice is not seafood-y at all, but is a delightfully savory mix of lemon and olive oil.-Pita Dips - 5.5/5The full name of this dish is ""Taramosalata, Melitzanosalata, Tzatziki Salad,"" which is enough to make me full (or, aka. ""caviar mousse,"" mashed eggplant, and cucumber yogurt dip). The pita bread is perfectly warmed and at an amazingly fluffy texture, and the dips themselves don't disappoint either. The ""caviar mousse"" resembles fine mashed potatoes in texture, and does not taste of seafood at all. It actually tastes more like hummus than anything else - awesome! The eggplant I thought was alright, but mashed to a creamy consistency that takes away the eggplant taste that offends some. The cucumber and yogurt dip is one of the best I've had...the yogurt delightfully balances the cucumber, but neither overimposes on the other. Having had a lot of pita dips in Middle Eastern/Southern European restaurants, this one takes the cake as the best I've had.ENTREES-Lamb chops - 5/5These lamb chops are definitely among the top 3 that I've ever had - I asked for it prepared medium rare, and the lamb came out a light pink that was juicy without any noticeable blood. The sides were roasted potatoes and beans, which were pretty average - the potatoes were definitely roasted very well but isn't super special (especially at $30+ pp restaurants). The lamb tasted like roast beef actually both in texture and flavor, which is awesome - I think largely it had to do with meat quality though rather than the method of preparation. I think Periyali just used lamb chops that are pricier than other restaurants at the comparable price range.On the Restaurant Week menu, it's 2 pieces of lamb, and we heard on the regular entree it's 3 pieces for $31. Honestly, I'm not sure whether this lamb is worth $31 even for three pieces - it's good, but $31 is asking a lot since I've had lamb that is almost equally excellent at Lalola (tapas bar in SF) for $18 at approximately the same portions. I may reconsider if the price range is closer to the Restaurant Week pricing. But otherwise, solid entree.-Fish with tomato sauce (not sure of exact name, haha) - 5/5Despite coming to a Greek restaurant, the lamb chops were definitely not very ""Greek."" The fish entree was dressed in a tomato sauce that was delightfully lemony (see a trend here?) and crisply refreshing. I tasted the tomato sauce expecting for a pasta sauce flavor, but the lightness of the sauce really surprised me and made the grilled fish extremely appetizing. I would suggest going for more dishes like this (dishes that accentuate flavor) at this restaurant, as it appears that they are pretty solid at getting the flavor down.DESSERTS-Orange cake, walnut cake, and almond cookies - 2/5This is the biggest disappointment of the night, as their desserts do not compare at all to the excellent entrees. Both cakes had the consistency of cornbread, and honestly with the ""orange cake,"" I could do a blind taste test with you vs. cornbread and you won't be able to tell the difference. The walnut cake was pretty much walnut-flavored cornbead. The almond cookies were tough and almost stale-tasting, which were totally different from American cookies. If you can imagine hardened macaroons, that's almost what they taste like. Given the baklava they have adorning their entrance table, I'm kind of confused why don't they just give me some of that baklava instead.Otherwise, Periyali was a surprising find in the NYC Restaurant Week listing - I'll be back!",2,0,0,Chris S.,"Manhattan, NY",92,143,697

Also, since she's a vegan (and I'm a pescetarian), I figured if she could find something to eat, so could I, so I won't complain.Anyhoo, we got there around 9PM, and they were busy so we were seated at the bar. The bartender/server was quite friendly and charming and gave us some useful suggestions as to what to order.We had split a salad, which was pretty good. I'm not a big fan of feta usually, but this was more creamy-feta, rather than stinky-feta, so no complaints there.I cannot stop thinking about what I ate last night. My friend suggested I try a beet/garlic sauce dish and OMG. SO DELICIOUS! It sounded like a really weird combination, but it goes together amazing. For the main course, I had salmon and okra wrapped in phyllo dough. Again, deliciousAt that point I was stuffed, but since I had gone with the prix fixe option, there was still dessert, which was some walnut cakes soaked in honey, and this circular pastry thing...not sure what it was called.

The fish was very fresh and the skin was wonderfully crisped from the grilling, seasoned to perfection. Even the broccoli on the side was good, not mushy and full of flavor. For dessert we ordered the rice pudding and baklava. The baklava was very good, but I'm not a big fan of sweets so I didn't eat much.

Upon entering Periyali we were immediately assisted and brought to our table. The place was lightly light and dim, I liked the lighting and atmosphere. There were a lot of people there yet the ambiance was still intimate. The furniture was all white, giving us the feeling like we were in Greece again. Drank some white wine from Santorini, not sure the exact name but it was very good.

Tremendous flavor and creamy texture.My wife had the chicken rice soup special and said it was rich and tasty.All three of us had the grilled fish specials.

Rice (cooked perfectly) and broccoli (a bit too underdone) were the sides.BV Cab by the glass was also a great suggestion. While white should have been ordered with fish, the fish had so much deep flavor that the strong cab was a good match.Even the decaf cappuccinos were high quality.Highly recommend it. The only negative on the night (very minor) was that in the beginning the waiter was a bit too anxious for us to order our meals and didn't pick up the signs that were catching up with a friend. We ordered apps in stages (I know that irks some restaurants) but we wanted to eat slowly.

2.0,1/10/2011,"First of all, where the hell is my Elite '11 profile badge? The moment I stepped into Periyali I had a bad taste in my mouth. There was a tray of sweets out similar to my favorite NYC greek dining, Kellari Parea Bistro also in Flatiron. I asked if the restaurants were affiliated and received a repugnant sneer from the maitre d' who acted as if I had insulted his mother. The coat check girl followed up with a stern ""NO, we are not."" Jesus, think the families know each other back in the old country?The appetizers were unimpressive. I usually order 2 appetizers instead of an entree. So I got the trio of taramosalata, eggplant spread and tzaiki as well as the grilled octopus. The octopus was actually better than the one I had in Mykonos but there was something slippery and unsettling about all the oil it was in.The trio of drips were literally slapped on the plate. There was a sad attempt at presentation with a carrot and celery stick strewn across my dips. Those belong with hot wings, not my $12 appetizer. Periyali also suffers from the stingy bread syndrome. 1 pita is not enough for a 1/4 lb of dip. Boyfriend got the moussaka which was dried out and awful. It was incomparable to the cheesy, multilayered heaven Kellari Parea offers. My dad had the striped bass which he gobbled immediately. He doesn't really count here. He's like Mikey--he will eat anything. Mom had the steak which was probably the best tasting out of everything on the table. Oh and the wine list? Everything is served by the bottle. I asked for wines by the glass (not on the menu) and was offered only 3 choices. The waiter recommended the Greek red and said it was in between a Rose and a Beaujolais. It was more like a Pinot Noir stewing in tannins.The mood lighting and general ambiance is what earns this place one more star. There seems to be a very beautiful garden in the back as wel.

The menu was pretty good, lots of different dishes and tons of appetizers.  We decided to split the chicken kabob with couscous and each order the chopped salad with feta, tomatoes and cucumbers.  The salads came out and were good but I couldn't help but feel like they were missing something, maybe a bit more dressing/seasoning?  The ingredients just didn't taste amazing.  Then when the chicken came out I was definitely a bit confused.  The menu said couscous but it was pastina with little pieces of onions and other vegetables?  Then when I asked for a little side of Tzatziki, the bartender came back with a large appetizer-plate full of it (which was delicious but practically enough to feed 4).I guess it's just me but I totally felt like I went to a car mechanic and left feeling ripped off...the bill was nearly $100!  I mean it was good but definitely pricey.",3,1,1,Kimberly L.,"San Francisco, CA",816,852,812

The experience this time around was absolutely & sadly disappointing. We ordered the spanakopita, tiropita kai kolokithokeftedes (spinach pie, cheese pie & zucchini fritters) which were as expected...good. The next up was calamari stuffed with rice & herbs swimming in tomato sauce. The stuffing & sauce were very good but the star of the palte was rubbery & disappointing.     My wife ordered a simple & traditional grilled shrimp with olive oil & lemon with rice pilaf & broccoli. The shrimp was dry. The rice ""Uncle Bens style"" nothing pilaf about it.   I ordered the rabbit with pearl onions in a tomato sauce (very similar to the calamari appetizer sauce). The rabbit was overdone as well. Only one piece of the 3 pieces was tender (like coq au vin) as I'd expected.  We also ordered the crispy sardines. These looked very appetizing. There were 2 pieces fried in a light batter. Upon tasting them they were very fishy tasting & unappealing. We returned them...    We finished with traditional honey & almond cookies which were as delicious as we'd remembered from our previous visit MANY years ago.    The wait staff was friendly & efficient. The presentation was underwhelming dish after dish. The quality of the food didn't nearly match the price demanded.    It seems as though there's been a change in management or chef since we last visited Periyali but it appears the flame has been snuffed when it comes to the memorable dining experiences we've enjoyed in years past at Periyali.",0,0,0,Tom F.,"New York, NY",66,45,105

There was minimal overlap in ordering. We had champagne, which our waitress recommended, a nice bottle of red wine, and we each ordered an appetizer and an entree. There were a few desserts ordered as well, in addition to coffee.My appetizer of spinach bourekas/mini crusty pies, cheese bourekas, and zucchini fritters was quite nice. So much so that I barely got to eat any of it because others kept coming back for more tastings. And I'm not one for fried food that often, but it reminded me of Middle Eastern food. I even struggled to say the full name in Greek, I think I probably butchered the names, but the waitress asked me, surprised, if I was Greek. If that was her sad attempt at acting and flattery for a higher tip, it was a bit on the unwise side, because I clearly was not the paying presence at the table.Others had the meatballs, beets, octopus, large white beans, etc.. Most people seemed content with their appetizers, and we all tasted a bit of most of the options. This was my first opportunity to notice that they seem to go by the notion that a pound of butter makes everything tastes better. Which may in fact be true, but I still think it's cheating when it comes to fine dining to just pile on the butter and call it delicious. The Giganti white beans were a bit bland without piling on the garlic sauce.Then, we had our main dishes. My chicken and fennel kabob was very tasty, especially when combined with the ""vegetable couscous"" which was more of an orzo, and was certainly drowning in butter. I did not taste much fennel, but the chicken was in fact delightful. Others seemed content with their dishes, though the two who ordered the fileto kabob were somewhat disappointed because they were overcooked, and a bit blander than desired. The lemon potatoes were a hit, and the chicken pie cooked in filo dough was also said to be remarkable. Other dishes enjoyed included the fish of the day, the rabbi, and lamb.Desserts featured baklava, orange cake, and almond cookies, and came simply decorated with strawberry halves on the sides of the plate.All in all the meal was nice and satisfactory, and the prices are reasonable for an upscale place (entrees ranging in the mid to upper 20s), but my husband remarked that he did not feel his dish was worth 29 dollars.I would not make it a haunt to frequent, but I could see the allure of going once in a many month period if you're really feeling the Greek food calling you.",0,0,0,monica I.,"New York, NY",13,31,0

Now two decades later a myriad of elegant Greek restaurants have opened in Manhattan, however, Periyali has remained a top destination for connoisseurs of fine authentic Greek food.  Periyali serves as a ""lulling antidote to the frequent overdoses of restless innovation and runaway imagination at other restaurants,"" raves Frank Druni of the New York Times. The food is fresh, delightful and dependable each time I go to Periyali.  Among my favorite dishes I love to start with the grilled calamari with oregano olive oil and baby greens.  With almost every restaurant in the city providing some variation of a calamari dish it is refreshing to have an establishment nail the perfect balance of golden crisp batter and fresh firm meat. As a main course I enjoy the braised lamb shank with tomato orzo stew.  The dark savory meat is complimented by the tomato orzo, which distinctly enhances the lamb's flavor.  Despite the amazing and decadent entrees, dessert is worth the extra splurge. Paul Adams from the New York Sun hails the kadaifi as ""the best dessert he has had in recent memory"".  Pariyali is truly one of my favorite restaurant experiences in the city, and if you enjoy finely prepared Greek food I urge you to call and make a reservation immediately!!!  (212) 463-7890",0,0,0,Sarah M.,"New York, NY",1,3,0

3.0,3/22/2006,"I went here for the winter restaurant week that just passed.  I was really excited that I would finally get to experience some quality greek food, but I was sadly disappointed.  the food was only okay.    the eggplant appetizer i had practically bled oil when i put my fork in it.  The fish entree was just a grilled whitefish with olive oil and lemon.  it came with a side of yellow rice and steam broccoli, also doused with the same lemon/oil mixture.  The dessert was a spice cake with syrup.  it was too sweet to me and not so appealing.  I actually liked the strawberry garnish more than the cake itself.  the decor was nice.  It almost feels like you're inside a long wooden ship.",0,0,0,Jennifer L.,"New York, NY",2,78,1
