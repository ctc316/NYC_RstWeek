5.0,10/23/2018,"One of the best meals I've had in New York City thus far. The service and attention to detail to all the food is close to none. The steaks were cooked to perfection, the seafood tower was fresh and amazingly delicious.  The sides are tasty and the crackerjack brownie sundae dessert really finished it off! The place is beautifully decorated and located in the heart of the city.  I will definitely be back!",0,0,0,Cessie C.,"Manhattan, NY",370,158,415
5.0,8/28/2018,"Very sad to discover that this location is officially closed!  I first went here for my birthday lunch back in May and then last month for dinner and each time was amazing.  The ambience was so cool and laid back, yet classy all at the same time.  The wait staff and hostesses were all very friendly and attentive.  The restaurant had the perfect temperature (never too cold or hot) and is very spacious.  Very clean (even the restrooms which were a little trip to get to, but there was an elevator).  Great place to hold a big lunch or dinner party.  Their steaks are to die for!!  So delicious and well seasoned!!  They also make a very good mac and cheese.  The Yankees memorabilia was very cool (I am a Yankees fan).  I will truly miss this location as it was a hidden gem. : (",0,0,0,Liana F.,"Queens, NY",0,12,0
5.0,8/26/2018,"If you are a Yankee fan this is the place for you! From the decor to the logos on the plates I absolutely love this place! The happy hour (4 is definitely worth checking out. They have a number of apps that are half price so you can try many things without breaking the bank. We tried sliders, wings and soft pretzels. They even had a beer special. Taking the wife on date night soon! Came in for the final night for a nice dinner. Had the 12 oz filet with blue cheese. It was very good! Creamed spinach was sautéed spinach with a little cream added. Unfortunately in a couple hours doors close for good so if you never got the chance to eat here you will need to hit the location in Yankee Stadium.",0,0,0,Bryan L.,"Brooklyn, NY",12,171,126

5.0,7/28/2018,"This restaurant is a gem. If you're a Yankees fan, even better. All that aside, the food and service was phenomenal. I had the salmon and, believe me, I KNOW my salmon! This was the best I have ever had. That's saying something considering I eat out a lot and eat salmon ..a lot. Don't let the fact that this place may seem sport themed.

4.0,7/27/2018,"As a Mets fan, it's tough to admit, however, the food is actually pretty good. The only reason I went was because my friend picked it as part of Restaurant Week. The food was good quality and I also enjoyed their signature cocktail 'summer catch'- I tend to prefer sweet cocktails. The crab cake for the appetizer was really good, it was moist and flavorful. I ordered from the RW menu, so chose the asparagus and prosciutto app and it was OK. I had the NY strip steak for my entree, which was also cooked well. My friend ordered the seafood linguine and she actually ate the whole thing, which is weird for her because she can never seem to finish her entrees and it was a pretty large portion, so I'll assume that means she liked it a lot! She didn't order dessert but the RW menu came with it, so I chose the cheesecake to go, so we could catch the next bus/train. The cheesecake was creamy and also quite tasty. I hear this place will be shutting down in a month, so if you're a big Yankees fan (or don't really care either way), it may be worth giving a try before it does.",0,0,0,Katherine P.,"New York, NY",135,101,4

5.0,7/25/2018,"I must say , I was very surprised as I have eaten at all of the big name Steak houses in NYC over the last six years. This place is as good and perhaps better . Steaks were very flavorful and cooked to perfection ( medium was actually medium). All appetizers were served swiftly and all were hot , and tasty ( fries , shrimp cocktail was chilled, creamed spinach spot on as well as the bacon).

5.0,6/24/2018,"This ended up being my families favorite meal of our visit in NY. I have kids around the ages of 9 and 10 and it's hard to find a lot of sit down restaurants that even had a kids menu or something with kids in mind in Manhattan. This place was great. I like to take my kids to at least once fine dining restaurant on each of our family trips because I think it is fun for them as well as being good experience for how you should behave at a nice restaurant. We were grateful to NYY Steak for being accommodating and welcoming. The food was awesome. My Delmonico Ribeye was perfectly cooked and seasoned. My wife loved her salmon. My youngest child, didn't really like his kids meal and didn't complain and was eating it, but the waitress could tell he wasn't loving it and suggested we get him something different. He opted for the Pizza instead of the Sliders and loved it. This was something they really didn't need to do, but they did anyway. The manager of the restaurant even came over and apologized, which wasn't necessary, and gave each of our two kids their own Yankee's hats! I don't think my boy has taken his off except to sleep and shower. Great experience and great service they made our day and our trip. They might have even turned our kids into Yankees fans!",0,0,0,Dale C.,"Ogden, UT",0,44,0
5.0,6/19/2018,My wife and I went here yesterday.  Let me state that the reviews looked good on Yelp and we were recommended this place at the hotel we stayed.Our meals and service was FANTASTIC.  No complaints or improvement suggestions.  Our waiter Maurice was Top Notch and all the staff was very helpful.We both order the Delmonico ribeye steak (which I was a little suspect about since Delmonico and ribeye are different cuts).  The steaks were cooked as well as seasoned to perfection.  Some of the best steaks we have had in awhile.  We also ordered the duck fat cooked finger potatoes...sinful.  These things melted in your mouth with incredible flavor.  Would highly recommend them if you haven't had them.Great bottle of Malbec wine made the meal a success.I would definitely go back and recommend to anyone.,0,0,0,C N.,"Dracut, MA",1,119,0
2.0,6/19/2018,"Went here with my family for Father's day. At first the staff seemed attentive but that wore off. We ordered a porterhouse steak for two cooked medium another steak medium and then scallops for me with two side dishes of spinach and mashed potatoes.When the steaks came my family cut into them and lo and behold they were not cooked properly, This was disconcerting as we went over with the waiter what each of the different choices were. Originally we wanted medium well but he said they would be a bit dry so we opted for the medium. We had to send them back and when they came back they were acceptable. The mashed potatoes were good the spinach left a lot to be desired.

I had the Delmonico ribeye with cream spinach and garlic mashed potatoes, and although the items we pricey ($48 steak, sides are $10-11) the meal did not disappoint. Steak was cooked perfectly medium with great flavor and the sides were both delicious. The staff was also friendly and attentive considering we showed up at 830 and they close at 9. My wife had the spinach salad with chicken and beef tortilla soup, which she enjoyed very much; fresh with excellent flavor.I would definitely recommend if you have some extra funds or want a real nice dinner during your stay in NYC.",2,0,2,Gilbert G.,"Sahuarita, AZ",39,47,32

5.0,4/12/2018,"Tonight was my brother's 40th birthday. It was a surprise dinner and I can not explain how wonderful the experience was. A huge thank you to Anastasia for her generosity and kindness. To Leshae (the hostess) who was so lovely and sweet to my mother. Chris the bartender was very kind. And Shante and Bilal were amazing as well. But the star was our waiter Eric who was patient and attentive and really just an amazing guy. The food was just delicious. I had the seared scallops and broccolini and it was flavorful and gorgeous. The broccolini, one of Eric's suggestions, was on the money with the slight kick of chili. I had the Left Field cocktail which was delicious with a yummy apple slice sprinkled with spices as the garnish. Yum. My brother was so excited and so pleased. The food was delicious but the staff there was awesome. Thank you for helping to make my brother's 40th birthday dinner a success.

5.0,2/15/2018,"ABSOLUTELY PHENOMENAL!!! This steakhouse is a MUST if you are in the Rockefeller Center area and you're a huge Yankee fan. Me & my boyfriend came here for Valentine's Day and everything was perfect. We made reservations for 7pm but got there about 15 minutes early but we're still seated right away. The wait staff is so polite, friendly, and can answer any questions you have about the menu and give you suggestions/recommendations based off of what you're looking to order. We both ordered the drink ""Left field"" which was amazing if you love apple cider (with a twist of Tito's ;) ) our waitress was so nice to ask if we would like the pepper grind on our drink, which we were glad she informed us because we're not into that, we like our drinks sweet. For dinner we ordered the house-made ravioli, the New York strip steak, the onion ring stack and grilled asparagus. Everything was cooked to perfection! Definitely worth it for the price you pay. It was such a great meal, the food was so flavorful and delicious with every single bite. Our waitress checked on us from time to time and made sure our drinks were filled. At the end of our meal after we paid the check we were greeted by who I assume was a manager of the restaurant and because we dined with them on Vday we got a voucher for 2 tickets to an upcoming Yankee game for the season! Such class. This Resturant was 10 stars in my book and we will definitely be back soon! Thank you for making our special day incredible!",0,0,0,Amanda T.,"Graniteville, NY",92,34,65
4.0,2/12/2018,Love sport-themed restaurants although I'm not necessarily a Yankees fan (oops..did I just say that?!). This is my second time here as I enjoyed the dining experience very much last time. Had a 11:45am reservation and were seated promptly. Ceiling was high and photos of the celebrity players were on the wall. The complimentary bread was warm and soft...just the way I like it. Service was excellent.Food we ordered:Salmon - very fresh and the skin was perfectly seared. The vegetable spaghetti was a bit sour to my taste but my friend loved it.Spinach salad - it was good. Nothing too special but it was light and just what I needed.Prosciutto & fig flatbread - I get this whenever I can. It was very good but can't say it's the best I've had. Truffle fries - there were awesome!PS: There's an elevator from the dining room to the basement where the restrooms are in case you are too lazy or too full to walk down the two flights of staircase.,2,1,1,Teresa L.,"New York, NY",92,413,3576

2.0,12/20/2017,"We were very underwhelmed. After some great meals on our trip to NYC, this one left a lot to be desired. We needed something close to Radio City, for timing. To be fair, the food was good. The service, at this price point, was not. Our server was perfectly nice, but had no recommendations, even when asked. We felt rushed the first half of the meal and a little forgotten the second half. It was just a little off, overall. We tried to have a cocktail before dinner, but it came out AFTER we ordered and got our salads. I don't really want a cocktail with my salad--maybe just personal preference. We would have had wine with dinner, but were never asked if we wanted anything else. The bread wasn't worth eating--in case you're cutting carbs. The sides were pretty good, not amazing, and fairly small. The size didn't bother me but the lack of guidance from the server did. We had to order another side, but it didn't come out until we were nearly finished with everything else. The pumpkin donuts should NOT be missed! In general, with so many options in New York, I wish we'd skipped this one. They should be hiring way higher quality servers.",0,0,0,Debbie S.,"Castle Rock, CO",2,29,0

Aside from the identity crisis the yankees decor was nice and the baseball diamond bread plates were a nice touch.  The Bacon App was to die for and the best thing we had all night. I had the bone in ribeye and my date had the Filet, both were remarkably undercooked in the middle per our order. The service was ok but no wow i want to come back here factor.

I was not a fan of how the ribeye is under sized. The price was reflected in the size but if you offer a ribeye you might as well offer a full size 20+oz portion in NYC. It was average and nothing special. It did not look appetizing and was dry. The au poivre sauce helped but a good steak does not need a sauce accompanied with it. The whole time I thought I could make a much better steak at home for half the price. I did have a good time though and the service was on point.

We shared the porter house for 2 and a side of Mac and cheese and the garlic mash potatoes, the steak was good cooked as ordered the garlic mash had a taste that didn't belong maybe too much sour cream and the mac was alright nothing special.

3.0,5/3/2017,"My friend and I were walking hungry around Rockefeller Plaza, so we decided to try out NYY Steak for dinner since it was the closest to us and the whole New York Yankees concept seemed interesting. Unfortunately ""meh"" would probably be the best way to describe our experience. The restaurant is quite spacious and I loved the decor of the bar (very chic) and the fact that everything (menu cover, dishes, napkins, wall art) matched the Yankees theme to a tee. Kudos on that!Now onto food. For started we were served complimentary bread and pretzel sticks, both of which were quite disappointing since the bread was hard as a rock, while the pretzel sticks were too darn salty. I had a Winter Rose cocktail and it wasn't bad.As entrees, my friend ordered their Delmonico Ribeye with garlic mashed potatoes and I opted for the Braised Short Rib. My friend's ribeye was alright, but the mashed potatoes were perfect - super fluffy and just melted in your mouth. I was also very impressed with my short rib. It was well seasoned and cooked, however about an hour after dinner and until about 3 am I was super nauseous so something must've been wrong with the short rib.The waiter and hostess were pretty friendly.

2.0,4/12/2017,"Went here for an early dinner before my wife and I caught a show at Radio City.  The service was great - the food was just OK.  For a steakhouse with high-end prices I honestly expected more.  The ribeye I had was under an inch think and pretty dry considering it was cooked medium rare.  It was not worthy of the nearly $50 price tag.  Far and away the best part of our meal was the house cut fries...they were amazing.  But, in the end that's not what you go to a steakhouse for.After seeing the ambiance, this place has New York Yankee tourist trap all over it.  My wife and I don't care for baseball - we wanted a good meal.  Next time, we'll walk a little further down the block to Del Frisco's or Strip House.",1,0,0,Rob P.,"Berwyn, PA",4,46,2

However when it was time to go and close out our check, they were having issues with their credit card machine. 30 mins later we ask for the bill again because we had plans and it was already midnight. They apologized explained the issue and asked for a few more minutes while they figured things out. They eventually had to take imprints of our credit cards in order to charge us at a later date. The staff member who took my information made a mistake and took down the wrong security number. The following day, a Sunday. My girlfriend (the birthday girl) Received a call from the manager asking for my information. He was very rude and abrupt. They were calling my phone while I was at brunch insisting that I call them back as soon as possible. Then again interrupted me at an art exhibit with this nonsense. It was your mistake, I will call back when I have time, do not harass me or my friends because of your error!!They ran my card so many times trying different security codes that the bank locked my card because of course I have fraud protection. Not only was the manager rude, he assumed that maybe I had gone over my ""card limit"" those were his words! I did not want to spend my sunday on the phone with a rude manager and my bank.

3.0,2/21/2017,I came here with my girlfriend for New York Restaurant Week. The atmosphere is very cool if you're a Yankees fan (tons of memorabilia). The food however was pretty underwhelming for the price. For the appetizer I ordered the potato soup which was ok but nothing special. I chose the ribeye steak for my entree which came medium well even though I ordered medium rare. We ordered a side of macaroni and cheese to eat with the steak which was actually pretty delicious. For dessert we had the creme brulee which again was ok but nothing fantastic.

4.0,2/13/2017,"My friend and I went for a last minute restaurant week deal. We did make a reservation on OpenTable (literally 15 minutes before we got there),  but you honestly don't need a reservation for this place. Plenty of space, and not overcrowded. The space is huge actually. There were these weird two tables set up in the waiting area at the entrance that got us thinking why would anyone want to sit here, but oh well.Desserts were good and bad. The dessert that came with it, chocolate lava cake, was amazing. Not too sweet, and good balance with the Gelato that came with it. The other dessert, creme bulee, was disgusting. It felt and tasted like one of those grocery store made custard. Fruits on top of it were also old and wrinkly, not fresh. Very disappointed on that dish.Steak dishes were also good and bad. Delmonico steak was good, although had too much fat, mushy thingy around the meat. A little salty, but it was ok. Skirt steak was too overcooked and not tender at all. My friend ordered medium rare, and the food came with well done dish. We weren't so happy with that dish.Both of us ordered the same appetizer, squash dish, and we felt iffy at first. If you eat all the individual ingredients separately, it's disgusting. But when you put it all together, it makes a perfect balance. We both ended up liking it.Still, given the last minute Friday dinner reservation, I think this place wasn't too bad.

We sat at the bar and had to put the dirty dishes aside.  This should have been a sign of what was to come !  After serving drinks to couples on each side of us who arrived after us the bartender finally took our order.  We voiced our displeasure and after that she seemed to totally ignore us. Gave us half a basket of bread that was cold. Had to ask the manager for a fresh bread basket.  No baked potato on the menu which seems strange for a top-notch steakhouse.

3.0,12/2/2016,"NYY might do in a pinch if you need a steak in the city, but you will do far better with a trip to Keen's.  Having warned you, the Delmonico was the only pleaser, with a respectable Caesar salad. The Brussels sprouts are prepared with chorizo but I didn't like the sweet honey flavor that overwhelmed both the spice of the sausage and char of a nicely roasted sprout. The sauce was sweet enough to pour over pancakes. Unfortunately I waited far too long for a waiter to arrive after seating, and not even a bus person came to the table to pour water, which would have proven redemptive. And there was a paper hand towel inside my menu. The manager apologized and gave me a free cocktail. Garlic mashies were good. But no baked potato option on the menu? That's a cardinal sin for a steakhouse. Little baseball diamonds for bread and side plates are rather kitschy, but the ostensible theme is baseball. Bread was crappy sweet cake. Nothing hearty.

There are very few places on this planet that do justice to showing a game on the big screen while giving you an upscale dining experience. NYY Steak does both of these things exceptionally well. The moment you step in you are engulfed in this classy sports bar kind of atmosphere and cannot not notice the memorabilia on the walls. I can imagine how awesome it must be for a die hard Yankee to dine here on game night. Apparently a lot of big names are common to frequent the place and enjoy a good brew with a healthy portion of fine cut meat. We happen to come here during NY Restaurant week and oh boy it was a treat. We were a part of two and we got to try the mussels and crab cake for the apps and hangar steak for the main course followed by both the dessert choices on the menu. Crab cake was well made. Minimal fillers and binding agents and crab meat was fresh. Hangar steak was juicy and fresh served with a side of mashed potatoes. The desert course of creme brulee was not so great. It has a nice think layer of caramel on top which was torched to give it a good texture and smell. Overall a solid experience and food.

Very modern looking place, with Yankee memorabilia and decorations everywhere, but done so in a way to still keep the sleek and classy look of the restaurant. The groupon was a set menu, but the choices were not lacking. For the appetizer, we got the fried oysters. We got five generously sized oysters, in a beautiful presentation. Neither my boyfriend or I ever had oysters but we figured why not give them a shot. We weren't disappointed. They were very crunch and had a nice taste.For entree, we got the filet that came with mashed potatoes and broccoli and then we were able to pick another two sides and we got the onion rings and I can't remember what the other was. The onion rings come in a tall stack, making an impressive and fun presentation. Everything we ordered was delicious. Steak was cooked excellently and the mashed potatoes were creamy and well seasoned.We were able to split a dessert as part of the groupon, which we ordered even though we were stuffed to max capacity!

Very light but full in flavors. For my main, I leaned toward the salmon (med rare). I kept it simple for dessert. I stuck with vanilla and chocolate ice cream although the chocolate covered pretzels are to die for and I'm NOT even a huge fan of pretzels. Overall, the food and service was superb. Would I return?

3.0,2/12/2016,"Came here for New York Restaurant Week. My co-worker and I were really hungry after work and decided to come here because it was close and it had good ratings. For the appetizer, I got the braised pork belly. Wow, that was amazing. Just for this dish alone, I would rate it 5 stars. The portion is small though, which is a bit disappointing. The entree I got is hanger steak. It was cooked perfectly (medium rare), but I wasn't a fan of the potatoes it came with. The seasoning was a bit off to me. I ended up getting cheesecake for dessert, but I didn't have it. I saved it for a co-worker since it was her birthday that day.Overall, it was a nice experience, but I don't think I'd come back.

3.0,2/4/2016,"As a die hard Yankees fan and steak lover, this restaurant was a must must!  The restaurant itself was very clean and just very tastefully decorated with memorabilia. The service was very friendly. A touch slow but very friendly. The food over all was excellent. The lump crab cake and salad wedge were delicious, as were the pretzel rolls. The 8oz filet mignon was excellent and cooked perfectly. The long bone ribeye was also excellent and cooked perfectly. So why the three star review?!?!  Well I'm glad you asked!  The fourth person in our party had ordered the ribeye. She in turn got the porterhouse for 2?  Not only that but it was well done and she had ordered it medium rare. It was also on the cold side like it was cooked before the other steaks and just sat there waiting for the others to be cooked. She started eating it and didn't want to complain or cause a scene so she did not complain. When we received our check we were charged for the porterhouse. That tells me that the server ordered the incorrect entree. All in all the question is will I return?  Yes,  we will give them another chance as everything else was excellent.",0,0,0,Joe C.,"Madison, CT",8,18,43

I ordered the pork belly and my friend the crab cakes. For entree we got the hanger steak medium well. Unfortunately mind was well done. The bartender was nice about it( being that we sat by the bar). I told her it was ok but I didn't eat all of it. We got our desert and it was delicious crime brûlée and cheesecake. I was surprised at how attentive the bartender was. She was nice overall good food and atmosphere.

Wow, it just blew my mind how terrible the service was. First off, we arrived about 30 minutes early for our reservation and they could not accommodate us. They were adamant that our table would be ready at 7 (the exact time of our reservation). So we sit at the bar (great bartender!) and waited while having a few drinks. at 7pm, we checked with the front to see if our table was ready, it was not-- and we kept checking every 10 minutes until THEY were 40 minutes late with our table. Every time it was a different excuse. When we finally get to the table, our waiter would disappear on us, when we finally got around to ordering, the food took a very long time to come out, and they brought the appetizers with the entrees, instead of before. We also requested some bread (which we noticed a table seated after us had already) and they said they were out of bread.

We asked for the steak to be prepared ""medium"" but it was definitely more on the rare side when it came out. They took it back to cook for longer. Even then it was still undercooked. They gave us a complimentary creamed spinach in return for the inconvenience. Another hiccup was that we were charged for the dessert even after our waiter confirmed that I checked in on Yelp for a free dessert. We couldn't finish half of our meal which is rare for us.

4.0,10/19/2015,"NYY Steak does things right! I had the pleasure of giving this place a try over a business dinner on a Wednesday night with a party of 12 and we all had a great time. The seafood selection was fresh and the wine selections were plenty. We started off with the seafood tower which offers a nice sample of lobster, crab meat, jumbo shrimp, oysters and tuna tartare. A variety of sauces were served alongside the tower to complement the oysters which the party devoured. The shrimp was hefty and the crabmeat was one of the best I've had. The tuna tartare is also worth noting albeit many mistook it for diced tomatoes at first glance. Aside from the tower, the tuna tartare and crab cake were a definite win. The tartare was served with a crispy (rice?) cracker and guacamole which paired so nicely. The crab cake was flavorful as well, however, between the two, I'd opt for the tuna tartare. For mains, you can't go wrong with the variety of steaks offered here. Since I'm not a steak fan myself, I opted for the scallops which were served in 3 pieces. For those that come hungry, I'd recommend ordering the steaks as they're served in large thick cuts which everyone else seemed to thoroughly enjoy. Sides were great as well and you really can't go wrong with any one, however, the fav of the night was the mac&cheese (obviously)!",1,1,0,Diana P.,"Forest Hills, Queens, NY",51,263,1003

Delicioius!  Pork was really tender and not dried out.  My steak was so flavorful and cooked perfectly medium rare for me.  Dessert I had the strawberry rhubarb crisp and she had the brownie sundae.  My crisp was a little too sour for me but that's probably how it's supposed to be.  Her sundae was so much fun.  It had cracker jacks and pretzels in it too!  The portions were very decent.  Even with side green salads on entree, I was stuffed in the end.  The restaurant itself is beautiful.  Subtle Yankee colors and very spacious with seating on different levels like a stadium.  Nicely done memorabilia around the restaurant.  Our waiter wasn't as warm and friendly as I would have liked and he didn't ask if we wanted any coffee with our dessert.  Being a Mets fan, I really didn't want to like it, but I did!",0,0,0,Arlene Y.,"Brooklyn, NY",6,54,51

I ordered the Delmonico ribeye and she had the ravioli. The steak was cooked and seasoned perfectly. Every bite was better than the last. The ravioli were made in house and the filling was a light blend of ricotta and spices. For dessert we shared the brownie sundae.

5.0,7/26/2015,"Went here for a friend's 40th. I didn't even know this place existed out of the stadium. First thing's first, you DON'T have to be a Yankees fan to enjoy this place. I'm a Mets girl but good food and impeccable service are more important and they really delivered on both. Also, I think people may have a misconception that this is a theme restaurant in the vein of Planet Hollywood or Hard Rock. Not at all!!! From the pretzel rolls down to dessert, we really enjoyed ourselves.  Our server Robert(o?) knew the menu inside out, knew a crazy amount about wine and was genuinely pleasant. Menu isn't huge but you need time to think through how you'll get to taste as much as you can without exploding. And they give you that time. Four of us shared a generous raw bar tower ""for 2"", a wedge salad and a crab cake. The mignonette that comes with the tower was so delicious, we used it on everything. It was acidic in all the right ways and full of flavor. My friend preordered a 27oz. Rib eye with a long bone and they carved Happy Birthday into it! Do this for someone! We also had some lobster and the porterhouse for 2. The porterhouse was tasty and tender but temperature was off. I also wished they served it in some of the drippings as most steakhouses do. We mentioned it to a manager who stopped to check on us. You would think we said it tasted terrible! She sprang into action and rectified it. We weren't so much complaining as giving feedback but she still went out of her way. Creamed spinach and garlic mashed potatoes were flavorful and the perfect compliment. Dessert included the creme brûlée (with chocolate dipped pretzels rods!!), the cheesecake and the brownie sundae (pretzels and cracker jacks!!). Not inexpensive but definitely comparable to other steakhouses. The decor is not overly masculine as a lot of traditional steakhouses are and I don't usually write about it but even the silverware and china are worthy of a mention. There is memorabilia and pictures but it is done tastefully. All in all, a really unexpected pleasure. Thanks to Robert, Jonarda and the  other manager who's name is escaping me right now.

4.0,7/16/2015,"At first blush, NYY Steak seems to be a place that wouldn't be that good just because it is using the yankee name to market itself. However, all the yankee stuff aside (plates with famous yankee numbers and the blue and white color ways of the linens), this is a seriously good place to eat. For this lunch, the wait staff started us off with some warm pretzel rolls. Nice. For the appetizer, I really liked the pairing of the maryland lump crab cake with the fresno chili vinaigrette. The next item that I liked a lot was the steak sandwich. If you aren't that hungry, it can easily satisfy the appetites of two people. However, the salt on the fries wasn't evenly dispersed so that was a little disappointing. We also tried the scallop entree, which was pretty good as well. The presentation seemed a little off, but I appreciated the effort. On the minus side, we had to wait 20 minutes for the entrees. Not sure what happened, but the waitress apologized, so I appreciated the recognition of this lapse. Service was very good and I would come back again.

This is the place for the one and only long bone ribeye with the option of engraving your name on the bone!  Deliciously presented and cooked at just under $80.  For heavy eaters, you can finish it yourself.  For the two of us,  it was more than enough to be shared.  We had the crab cake as an app, the long bone ribeye as the main, creamed spinach as the side, and ended the meal with a wonderful creme brulee.  Oh, and there was a Yankeetini and Syrah in there as well.  The crab cake was as expected in one of these high-end locations, chunks of crab and not much else, no filling, no breading. Served with a slightly spicy salad and sauce, the crab cake was a perfect app to start the evening.  Then we had the long bone ribeye at medium rare paired with creamed spinach.  The ribeye was perfectly cooked and deliciously seasoned.  Since it is a ribeye, expect some fat around the edges and you won't be disappointed.  As for dessert, we really wanted the volcano but they had no volcano for the day.  This worked out for the best because it was supposed to be big enough to serve 6, and there's no way we could've finished all that.  We barely finished our meal as it was!  Do check into yelp and you'll receive a free dessert for the table.  Overall, it was a wonderful experience for dinner if you're willing to indulge in high prices for a bit.  Definitely worth a visit for any Yankee and steak lover!",3,0,0,Leila L.,"Brooklyn, NY",123,422,720

3.0,7/2/2015,"I have mixed feelings about NYY Steak. The place is absolutely gorgeous..the staff was beyond friendly. I just feel as if right now it is the chain touristy version of a luxury dining establishment. I bought the dinner for two groupon for I believe $80. My boyfriend and I needed to use it before it expired and my boyfriend forgot he had already made plans with another couple for dinner so decided to ask them if they wanted to join us. I called day of for a reservation and had no issue making one. I cleared it with the reservationist, making sure she knew 1/2 of the party had a groupon and it wasn't an issue. We get here, are seated promptly. The Groupon menu was printed on a piece of paper- which I could care less about really, but when the other half of your party has huge leather-bound menus, you feel like you were given the kids menu or something lol. In all fairness, the groupon menu really did have some awesome options and the value is amazing. You truly get a lot of food for the price paid.On to the food:The pretzel buns given about 10 minutes after we ordered which was strange, usually its brought out promptly. They were out of this world. We asked for more (they are served one piece per diner) and were given a different mediocre piece of bread.  For cocktails, I had the Bronx Bomber and it was good, too sweet so after two I switched to coors light. My girlfriend asked for a mojito and hated it. Her fiancé asked for a new different drink for her, stated she didnt like the moijito and no question was asked as to why and no offer to discount it or anything...ok first strike.Our appetizers were yummy. I went with the french onion soup, my boyfriend had the caesar salad and our friends shared the steak tartare. All was good until the entrees came out. I went with the filet mignon, my boyfriend the chicken, our friend had the salmon and his fiancé had a pasta dish. All of the entrees beside the pasta came out. The waiter informed us that they were ""rolling out new menu items"" and the chef tasted her pasta and it was too salty so he wanted to remake the entire thing. Ok cool...I guess. So we are all almost finished with our entrees when her new and supposedly improved pasta comes out. She took a bite and almost spit it. We all tasted a bit of it and it gave salty a new definition. I am the type to over-salt and love it - but I couldn't even chew this. We told the waiter and he apologized, and took that dish off of the bill. He came back and told us they tried it in the kitchen and we were right it was horribly salty. I just don't understand how that happens? The place died down it was us and another table. My boyfriend and I had a dessert included in our groupon so we wrapped it up. Verdict? I would not come here without a groupon.",1,0,0,Jessica N.,"Long Island City, NY",222,410,343
3.0,7/1/2015,"Service was impeccable as usual.The menu has taken a nosedive.  Really disappointed that the lobster mac n cheese is gone.  Also not happy to see that the 6oz has been dropped.  Ribeye came out without the bone.So most of the quirky details and signature dishes that made this standout against the other steakhouses, in my opinion, have suddenly disappeared.  Thick steak bacon was great as a starter.  Tough call on this one.  Expensive meal for many of the dishes that I had expected to see, but weren't available.",1,0,0,Barbara D.,"Denver, CO",462,395,9
5.0,6/29/2015,"When you think New York Yankees steakhouse  you are probably thinking tacky tourist trap . How wrong could you be. Yes there are some TV screens so you can catch a ball game whilst you eat and pretend to listen to your girlfriend at he same time . Yes there is some Yankees memorabilia on the walls. But NO its doesn't compromise excellent food , service and classy décor .We came for the Groupon deal on Friday and my only regret is we didn't buy more.To start we had the Maryland crab cake , holy crap this is the best crab cake ever. All crab and no cake . Amazing !The buratta tomato salad was huge and just as a tasty .The fillet mignon was perfect, cut like butter and one of the best steaks I had since Gallagher's .Double pork chop was so big we had to take it home .

5.0,6/21/2015,"When some friends decided to come into the city to meet me for dinner and picked this restaurant, I was skeptical to say the least. First, while I don't mind the Yankees, I'm not a fan. (Once a Philly girl, always a Phillies girl!) Second, it's in Midtown. What's the problem with that? To me, that means high priced tourist trap. But these are amazing friends so I sucked it up and said okay.We met at the bar where drinks were a bit pricey ($16 for a martini) but I have to admit...it was one of the best martinis I've had. It was called a Blue Something-or-Other, but it was basically a Ketel One dirty martini. The bartender...I forget his name (Shay? Kay? Say?) was wonderful and kept our drinks full and exchanged quips back and forth with a bunch of veteran teachers who are not easily impressed. We loved him.When our reservation came up, we moved upstairs to our table where Andrew Micinowski, our waiter, greeted us. We looked over the menus...pricey, but honestly? Not that pricey for a New York steakhouse. Two of my friends picked the porterhouse for two, I had the ribeye, and my other friend had a filet. While we were waiting, we got talking to Andrew and found out he was from the same small area of Pennsylvania that my friends (and originally I) are from, so that got us gabbing. He then brought the chef out to meet us...who is also from PA. I have worked in the restaurant industry before and have rarely seen the executive chef go out to a table...certainly not in New York City! He then sent us a beautiful salad for the table, ""his compliments"". What?? In New York City??Dinner came and the steaks were perfectly done...well done for the porterhouse (I know...horrible!), medium for the filet, and mooing for my ribeye. Each steak was fantastic! The sides of asparagus, macaroni and cheese, and truffle fries were amazing complements to the entrees. As we finished, the director of operations, Michael Salmon, came over to ask how we were enjoying our experience. He spent quite a bit of time chatting with us and we discovered he also has PA ties. Such a small world!! Then Erik Gonzaga, the operations manager, stopped by to see how everything was. By this point my friends and I were looking at each other and thinking, ""Crap! They must think we're related to Derek Jeter or something! We're gonna get kicked out any minute!"" It was simply unfathomable to us that we were being treated like royalty at this place...but we ate it up for sure!Time for dessert. No one had room, but that didn't stop us from asking Andrew what he would recommend. He said the NYY Steak 151 Volcano would be perfect for the table. Volcano? How could we go wrong? He brought this mound of vanilla bean ice cream covered in ground up Heath bars to the tableside where he poured 151 proof rum over it and lit it on fire. (See picture!) Each of us got a piece that was ginormous and so, soooo good! We had after dinner drinks and coffee where Rodrigo took excellent care of us, making sure everything was filled and refilled. As we finally started to leave after FOUR hours from bar to table, we met Jim Stewart, the director of catering sales, who also wanted to make sure we had an excellent time. (I remember all their names because they all gave us their cards!) I cannot believe what an amazing experience we had here. The food was amazing but it was the service and attention that puts this place over the top in my book. We literally felt like Yankee royalty! (I'm still convinced they acted like this under the mistaken assumption we were related to someone special somehow!) If you want great food and an exceptional dining experience, even if you're not a fan of the Yankees, this is the place to try.

She raved over it...I had the Caesar salad.....very good but different. Had a strong anchovy taste but nonetheless good. For our main course I had the filet mignon. It was cooked perfect and tasted even better.....Morton's look out. Naomi rold me that the filet comes over garlic mashed potatoes and recommended I get a different side. I ordered the onion ring tower. Best homemade onion rings I've ever had.....so many I took half of them home.  My girlfriend had the Salmon with Asparagus and said it was delicious. The Groupon came with a shared dessert so Naomi recommended the chocolate cake which I saw being brought out earlier....it was a huge piece. Being that we were pretty full, Naomi split the piece into two and packed half of it up for us to eat at home. The cake was fantastic. The place was beautiful....top notch in my book. Naomi made it even better....she was so informative and a great help with all her suggestions. The only downside which I felt was so unprofessional was when my girlfriend returned from the bathroom (she was wearing a very sexy tight dress) as she passed the bar, the bartender let out a loud enough for her to hear ""Woah"".....very unprofessional for that type of establishment.",0,0,0,Jason R.,"Bronx, NY",0,27,1

Our server came over with their drink menu and gave us serval recommendations on wines and gave us the specials for the evening . All which were just amazing . We were just so excited for the good so we opted to skip the apps and go straight to entrees . The wait was long just because my mother ordered the pork chop well done and given that it's a very thick cut it took longer too cook which was completely understandable . The wait was worth it once the food arrived , the pork chop was just perfect and my mother loved it , brother had the 18oz New York strip and he just loves every bite , i chose the boneless rib eye which had just the right amount of fat to keep the flavor it was a perfect medium rare , my partner had the filet mingon and left the plate clean, we all shared sides that went perfect with every entree. All which were paired with a very light Malbec We finished off your meal with a free dessert (with yelp check in) we chose the NYY steak 151 volcano which was very cool and delicious mountain of coffee bean ice cream covered in Heath bar served with a shot of 151 which of course was lit up in a really cool way .

The pretzel bread was my favorite.The dirty martini was amazing. They give you a choice of vodkas and even have blue cheese olives! At $18 a piece they aren't cheap but you get what you pay for.The caprese salad was huge as the beef steak tomatoes were the size of my head! I liked the thinly slice red onion as it was a nice touch. The crab cake was fresh and delicious and had a lot of crab not just fillers.The filet mignon was made perfectly and was tender and cut like butter.The onion stack looked more like bagels and was a little on the oily side but was fun to look at and photograph. The mushroom side was chewy and flavorful. They no longer offer the Brussels sprout hash.I didn't care for the chocolate cake as it tasted a little old and seemed like it had been refrigerated for a while. All in all great food and service. This restaurant will set you back about $100/person so make sure you go hungry! They also have a lot of Yankee photographs. The Navy blue theme (waiters wear pin stripe, napkins and chairs are navy blue) runs thru the store and the menu is very Yankee centric (27 wines and Yankee themed cocktails: Yankeetini).

Mussels were horrible, big huge fat mussels that tasted funny. The crab cake was ok, not great. Entrees we ordered the filet mignon and beef short ribs. The short ribs and polenta were so bland, really bad. The steak was ordered medium and came out like a hockey puck. We never send food back but had to. The next one came back cooked on outside but raw on inside. The manager tried to make a comment that we really wanted a medium well. He was smug and made it seem like we screwed up.

We did get lost on the way there, passed right by it. When we finally got there we were seated at a nice table upstairs. Our waiter was a little off and seemed to just not really want to be there. We had two groupon deals, one for Jack and I, one for his sister and brother-in-law, we were ready to eat. Each couple got two appies, two entrees with a side each and one dessert according to the Voucher. So we ordered PEI Muscles, two beat salads and a tomato mozzarella plate. The portions were big and they appies were really good.For the drinks I had a Russian Mojito, Jack had a Jack N Coke(I think he likes it because it has his name in it), Boris had a beer because they did not have an apple Martini. The cocktails were very watered down, even when I got a floater on my second one. For the entree, I got the short ribs, which I did not like and traded with Jack's Filet Minion. Boris loved his Ahi Tuna and my sister-in-law was just not that lucky. She ordered a salmon with corn. Although we told the waiter that we did not want anything with pork in it, he didn't think it was important enough to tell her that her corn came with bits of bacon. She had a few bites before she realized that there was bacon in it, and she was very upset. The manager came, and was very apologetic when he heard the dilemma. He comped our drinks and ordered her a new salmon without the corn. Sadly enough, the second salmon was terribly raw on the inside and burntly seared on the outside. When we called the waiter over he didn't even need for us to speak, he instantly saw what the problem was. He took away the salmon and they put another one to cook. Although this was very disastrous to say the least, because the manager was willing to compensate for what they lacked in other ways, I gave them a 4 star. He gave us a volcano dessert on the house besides the comped drinks, which was really nice. The volcano dessert was vanilla ice-cream surrounded by almonds. Over it they pour run and fire it up.

It was on top of a risotto type dish. I didn't not like it at all. So I wouldn't recommend that.My brother in law had the AHI Tuna which he reported at ""great and well cooked"" w/sweet potatoes and asparagus.  The sides were great as a whole. Big portions and prepared with love.My sister ordered that salmon , which we later found out had bacon in it. She wasnt too happy with b/c prior to ordering we asked the server if there was any pork in any dish and he said ""No"". We alerted the manager , Eric, and he was more than happy to amend the situation with a new , freshly Cooked salmon. However, when the 2nd salmon came out, it was RAW on the outside , so they got it wrong again!!. The whole table was laughing at this point cuz we felt bad about what happened, as did the manager. They finally got a well cooked salmon dish on the third try and even supplemented us with more sweet potatoes. Eric was a cool guy and even gave us  the volcano dessert on the house (check video.).

I went to this restaurant with a groupon deal. I am not sure if that effects the quality or quantity of the food but please bare this in mind. The deal was for a party of two and included two sides, each a main, and a shared desert. I had the fried oysters in hollandaise sauce while my date had the thick cut bacon. The bacon dish was leaps and bounds better. There are three strips covered in a light coating of syrup. The fat that was apart of it was cooked in a way that it melted in my mouth without being chewy. The oysters seemed to lack care in how it was battered. The batter was heavily coated with barely any oyster texture or flavor to shine through. The hollandaise sauce I think would have complimented it well if the batter was lighter; since it wasnt it didnt seem to work. Our main dish was the 8oz filet mignon at medium rare. The steak temperature came out perfect and was super tender. It seemed to lack enough seasoning so a lot of table salt was added. The mashed potatoes with cherry tomatoes was nice but wished they had some/any butter in it. The sides we had were creamed spinach and truffled fries.  The consistancy of the fries were perfect but I had a hard time tasting the truffle.  The parmesan that was on top helped but there didnt seem to be enough of it.  The creamed spinach was ok but didnt seem too special.  It could have been more creamy.The shared dessert was the chocolate cake. The portion size, even for both of us was refreshingly massive. It was accented with strawberry,raspberry, whip cream and blueberry. The consistency of the cake was a bit different than what I am used to. Being a big chocolate cake fan, I either expect the cake to be fluffy or dense. This cake was a bit in-between with the mouse the same consistency. I think I would give this place another shot if the price point was a bit lower, but being that its a bit costly, there are better options elsewhere.",0,0,0,Calvin C.,"New York, NY",60,62,86
4.0,3/23/2015,"Yankees and Steak, how can anyone go wrong. A bit on the pricey side to be expected. Bar area downstairs is spacious and can hold plenty. Restaurant splits into levels with the top being the smallest but with a glimpse into the chefs as the prepare. The bacon ap is a must so have your heart attack juice ready. But so worth it.

4.0,3/17/2015,"Honestly I would never have come here if they didn't have a Groupon deal. I was pleasantly surprised at how nice the dining experience was! The space is huuuuuuge. Very open interior with a classy vibe and they're not tacky with the Yankee decorations-just a few pictures. We were seated right away and the host and waiter were awesome. Our Groupon was for four people and included an appetizer, entree, side, and 2 desserts between four people. I ordered the beet salad for my appetizer and loved it. The presentation was beautiful and the proportion of beets to goat cheese to broccolini was just perfect. For my entree I got the 8 oz filet mignon. The presentation was boring, especially after seeing the beet salad. It was just mashed potatoes, two pieces of broccoli, and steak. The broccoli was overcooked and lacked flavor. The steak was very good, however. Cooked perfectly to maintain tenderness and juiciness. I had brussel sprout hash for my side and it was both delicious and beautiful. I was too full by the time my cheesecake arrived but I took a few bites and it was also very good.Overall I enjoyed my dining experience but even the price of the groupon was expensive although it was apparently about 50% off. I just do not see how this dinner was worth so much. If it was $30 maybe I would go back but there is no way I am spending $100+ here.",2,0,0,Mia K.,"New York, NY",66,113,181

5.0,3/4/2015,"I had been wanting to go to NYY Steak for a while and I was finally able to go with my fiance to celebrate our recent anniversary. SO SO SO happy that we ate here because our experience was exceptional. From the decor, to the service, and the food -- it was all excellent. The restaurant knew we were celebrating our anniversary and when we sat down to our table, our waiter handed us a customized menu that read 'Happy 8th Anniversary' on top. It was very cute and extremely thoughtful. We came during restaurant week and took advantage of the special menu. I ordered the lobster mac and cheese and the 8oz fillet mignon. The lobster mac and cheese had delicious chunks of lobster and was cooked to perfection. My steak was also cooked perfectly and was more than enough for me. For dessert, we opted to share the GIANT ice cream sandwich (served with YooHoo on the side) and we also took home a slice of cheesecake which we ate a few days later. Their cookies and cream dessert can seriously feed a small nation. IT'S HUGE. The cookie was tasty, not too sweet, and went well the vanilla ice cream. It was a perfect ending to our great meal. If you're a Yankees fan, you'll definitely enjoy the details that the restaurant has. It's a beautiful space with pictures of past Yankees displayed on the walls. Even the waiters wear pinstripes. The service here was top notch. Our waiter was so nice, helpful, and refilled our wine glasses constantly.

4.0,2/27/2015,"Batter up!I always avoided this place, I thought it would be filled with tourists and crappy food. It's restaurant week in NYC and I'm craving steak. Not Outback crappy meat but a nice cut of Delmonico steak. I saw a few top notch restaurant dinner listings but NYY Steak had a Delmonico for a $15 up charge as well as thick bacon for a starter. NYC restaurant week, for dinner gets you an appetizer, entree, and dessert for $38 bucks. At that price It allows you to try the best NYC area restaurants. (And trust me, I have a loooooong list, NYC rocks!)This restaurant is very close to Rockefeller Center. My thought process is pass, they'll be tourists everywhere. This is so not the case. I walked in on a Thursday Night and saw after work folks enjoying happy hour. And Jeter isn't serving drinks?? Damn, I never get lucky.Starting on deck, I order a nice glass of NYY Cabernet as well as my thick cut bacon starter. The Bacon? Really rich and decadent. Savory. Man on first.My steak ($15 upcharge) is the Delmonico steak with a side salad. Cooked medium thankyouverymuch.The steak, although wasn't as thick as I dreamt about it in my mind, was cooked perfectly and the taste? OMG, so good and it cut like butta.Man steals second.I wasn't thinking about dessert and I ordered the cheesecake. The cheesecake was topped with the fresh fruit was very good. I was going to eat 1/2 the piece but I couldn't stop eating it, it was a triple double!!OMG! Man is rounding the bases, its a home run hit right out of the park!There are huge pictures of the team on the walls, to me its a very classy looking spot.

I would recommend if anything, to get the lobster mac & cheese. My friend ordered the kale salad, filet mignon (8oz), and chocolate mousse. She also enjoyed every item on her dishes.

5.0,1/6/2015,"Visited September 24,2014. I have been meaning to post about our night at NYY Steak. NYY Steak tops our lists of favorites. My 14 year old son and I saved for a long time and took a  trip to NYC to watch Derek Jeter's last game.  To my surprise my son made reservations at NYY Steak. He usually treats me to dinner on Wednesdays but it is more like Outback Steakhouse for the 2 for $25.00 special!! He made reservations that morning when we got off the plane. We decided to walk to the restaurant and we got lost along the way, we called to let them know and thankfully they helped us make our way there. When we arrived the steakhouse we where greeted with a warm welcome and then shown to our seat. It was perfect window seat and when the server placed our menus down there was a Happy Birthday Message on the top of the menu for me! That made my evening. We decided we were going to try everything on the menu. We started off with the Crab Bisque! It was rainy and cold so it was the perfect start of a delicious meal. The server suggested some menu items and we met a beautiful family who was sitting next to us and they recommended the NYY Steak Bacon!! That was the best Bacon I have ever tasted! I have yet to have anything compare. For our entree my Son and I chose the Filet Mignon. The food was prepared to perfection and was out of this world. We finished our meal with the Cookies and Cream and Creme Brulee. My son fought to of fish the colossal  cookie with Ice cream.  Everything was far above our expectations. When I looked at my watch I noticed we spent 2 and a half hours there!  It was truly a awesome evening! One thing I have to mention our Serve, He  was spot on with his recommendations and he was so attentive to our needs. He was filled with stories and Yankee history. He also made my son feel important and thought it was awesome to be taking care of me the way he does. I wish I could remember our servers name because he was truly a compliment to the restaurant. The beautiful family I mentioned above,we spoke with them the entire evening. They loved our story and we enjoyed talking about the Yankees and sharing stories. Our server brought the tab over and handed it to me and my son quickly grabbed it and said Im treating my mom tonight. Well he thought that was so cool and asked my son how do you make your money. My son replied I umpire baseball. the family next to us was asking my son questions and such... My son pulled out is wallet and as he did the server was standing behind him and said tonight the meal is on this gentleman. Little did we did we know the beautiful family next to us paid for our meal. We were so thrilled and grateful we hugged them all with thanks. They shared they have never done that and have always wanted to and they chose us. My son and I left feeling so grateful. No one has ever made us feel that special. What a great evening. Thank you NYY Steak for a beautiful meal and THANK YOU to the Beautiful Family we may not know your name but you will remain in our hearts forever! **side note my son has saved that money that should have gone to the meal in hopes that one day he can do the same for someone else.",1,0,2,Grace H.,"Davidson, NC",14,27,22

When we came in , we weren't too optimistic as we hadn't made reservations - we weren't clear on our plans. But the front desk manager was able to get us a table although he did tell us that there were some time constraints- which was fine. We had the best waitress who told us the specials and answered all our questions. We all ordered the 8 oz Filets, which came perfectly charred on the outside and pink on the inside. Delicious ! We ordered the goose fat potatoes ( highly recommended by our waitress ) and they were delicious along with the green beans. While it was approaching out time limit, we knew we wanted dessert and I mentioned that it was our daughter's birthday. Since we were chocoholics, we were thinking of splitting the chocolate cake ( which we heard was huge ) , but our daughter was also thinking of the brownie. But we said we would just get the cake as it was huge. Our sweet waitress brought the cake but also the brownie as a treat for our daughter with a candle . So special ! Of course the cake and brownie were gobbled up and we were very happy with the service and the vibe of the restaurant.

1.0,12/10/2014,"Why does one go to a steakhouse boasting four $-signs, located in the heart of Manhattan? Because that person can understandably expect that between the service, the ambiance, and--especially--the food, AT LEAST two of the three will be worth the premium. In my experience at NYY Steak, all three of these elements were unacceptable. In fact, they were laughable.First of all, the four of us waited 35 minutes past our 7:30 reservation time to be seated (it was a Wednesday night, btw). The hostess and assistant manager were annoyingly inauthentic in their apologies and insulting in their reasoning for the delay. ""The party ahead of you is taking longer than expected."" they said. You mean to say that there was one single table picked out specifically for my reservation? This is a 200-seat restaurant!!!! The waiting didn't end there. 45 minutes after we placed our orders, I asked to speak to the manager (remember, it's been almost an hour and a half since we walked in). He came over and went straight to ""would you like some free dessert?"" If he was any better at being a jackass he should've asked ""would you like some hospitality?""Despite the blatant dishonesty, ignorance, and Yankee Stadium-like fracas, all could be forgotten with a delicious steak dinner. Alas, all would NOT be forgotten. The $60 ""signature"" bone-in rib-eye was under seasoned, tough, and halfway to cold. My friend's petit filet was charred. Another's roasted chicken looked dry from across the table. And to top it all off, the waitress asked if we wanted to ""order some dessert."" Laughable, right?If you're looking for a restaurant with some gimmicky, home team decor, then maybe NYY is for you. But if you want to have a special meal with good steak and enjoy good company (and eat at a reasonable hour), then DO NOT DINE HERE!Lastly, as we were walking out, we bumped into another patron who could not wait to strike up small talk and vent about his equally horrible experience!",5,3,1,David H.,"Seattle, WA",3,9,0

I  know nothing about baseball but still had a fabulous experience.We came here for steak on our last evening in NYC and we were certainly not disappointed. they have a room in the basement where they age the beef and you can see the meat hanging there just waiting to be ordered. From the moment we walked in the door service was amazing. Everyone asks your name and then continues to uses it which is a little bit strange.. but I guess some people like to feel 'special'. We requested a 'quiet' table which is quite a rarity in New York City due to the volume of its residents but they did their best to accommodate us and we got a table on the second floor, which was substantially quieter than the ground floor where a loud group were gathered at the bar.Our waiter was charming, and everything about the evening was super efficient. The only thing I would criticise would be the bread choice. There wasn't any. It was pretzel roll or pretzel roll. It was OK, but as it's not even close to my fave bread I would of liked a choice. We decided not to have a starter as we really wanted to enjoy the steaks and so i ordered a filet mignon with lobster tail and my husband ordered the strip steak. We had a side of onion rings and steak fries. The onion rings were served as a tower and were visually quite impressive. They probably could of fed a family of five and so needless to say we didn't finish them... They were excellent though. Fresh, hot and crispy. No complaints. We managed to finish our steaks and in a moment of madness my husband ordered a dessert. I can't remember the name but it was almost as big as my head. It was two enormous (very sweet) biscuits with ice-cream in between. Like a monster ice-cream sandwich. We probably ate about a 10th of that. It was so incredibly sweet and a few spoonfuls were as much as I could manage.All in all a great experience - even if you aren't a Yankees fan. anexpatwife.com/the-rest…",0,0,0,Swisswife Y.,"New York, NY",0,31,3

4.0,10/12/2014,"NYY Steak overall score: 89Ever since moving back to NYC, my dad and I have been talking about hitting the relatively new New York Yankees Steakhouse in midtown. We were finally able to set up a visit (they're only open on weekends during dinner hours, and my parents usually visit during lunch hours on weekends, so we had to reassess the normal visit routine). So my parents came in with my oldest nephew. It was hotter than Derek Jeter's balls in a Phoenix double header that day. My wife, my parents, my nephew and I were all sweating our asses off. We were walking around Central Park in the lead up to the reservation when out of nowhere it began to pour. Rain was coming down hard, as if Poseidon and Zeus were having a golden shower party in the sky. We ran out of the park and, lucky for us, a bus was heading down 5th Avenue just as we exited. The bus let us off just around the corner from the restaurant, where we were finally safe from the downpour. Check out the count below:Flavor: 8I ordered the 27oz long bone rib eye. It was perfectly cooked, nice and juicy, tender, and didn't have too much inedible grizzle on it. However I felt like it was just a hair under-seasoned. Nothing worth complaining about in the slightest. The most awesome part about the steak, for me, was the custom etching of your name into the bone. Upon taking our order, Michael, our awesome waiter, asked my father and I what text we wanted etched into our rib bones. WHAAAT?!??!!! THIS IS AWESOME!!! Check it out!!!

1.0,8/22/2014,"Well, I went to NYY steak with such high expectations as I loved the experience at the location in Yankee Stadium - great food, great service, all around an A+ dinner.So, I decided to make a lunchtime reservation for a work meeting.  Arrived at noon, and was seated pretty quickly.  I was surprised they put us at a table in the middle of the restaurant given all the open booths, but no real foul quite yet.Our waiter came and went on for about 10 minutes about how a 28 oz porterhouse is a great lunch choice.  I've worked in table service, so I know the theories about selling to your table, but this just came off as pushy.  He then moved into describing twin lobsters.  OK, we get it, but we're going to probably just get sandwiches.  Then he said we had to start with the bacon.  Lay off, man.  It's noon and I am not about to have a three course meal.Next, he disappeared for a good 30 minutes.  Not really disappeared, but stood close to our table, and ignored us.  The bus boy must have filled our waters at least three times during this period.  I made eye contact with him more than once, and he looked at me, our table, and then turned and continued chatting with the other waiters.  It's lunch time, we're clearly going back to work, I'd appreciate some sense of urgency.  Finally, a different waiter noticed our distress, and asked if everything was okay.  I said, no, it's not, we'd like to order at some point.  Our waiter finally came back and said he did not want to interrupt us.  What does that even mean?  Are we supposed to sit in silence until we order?When the food finally came, an hour past the time we sat down, it was not even good.  I had the chicken sandwich- the chicken was so dry, I could barely eat it.  In fact, I left half of it behind.  The bacon was cold and the avocados were soggy.  All around, not good.  And the coleslaw side reminded me of the slop they serve on Big Brother.  #terrible.Again, it took about 20 minutes and me waving my hand for the waiter to realize we were done eating since he was back to chatting.  While he cleared our plates I gave him my credit card to speed things up.  After two hours, and still hungry after my half eaten lunch, I was ready to leave.He was totally oblivious, and never once apologized.I am very disappointed, NYY Steak.",9,4,3,Jennifer C.,"Wakefield, MA",79,613,3
1.0,8/10/2014,"Well. How to start. First, we arrived a few minutes in advance, on a Saturday night, and were greeted by the host. We were the only individuals with reservations. Then, we were told that if we had to have a table immediately, we could sit at a high top at the bar, but that we would have to wait ""for a real table"". A bit strange as we had reservations and the restaurant was not even busy. So we waited 10-15 minutes with the hosts awkwardly standing around. We were finally seated and given a waiter who asked if we wanted still sparkling or bottled water, who then disappeared. We then were told we had a new waiter who once again asked the same question and disappeared. Finally a wait staff came to ask a 3rd time, taking approximately 20 minutes to even receive water. At this point, we're a bit weirded out that such a ""nice"" restaurant doesn't seem to communicate at all. While we're waiting to order, we start looking around. If you're over 50, male, at least 200lbs, and bald or balding, and are a huge Yankees fan, GO HERE! If not, this place is fucking awkward. Ultimately, we ordered, the steak was 'ok' (nowhere near the quality of an ACTUAL steakhouse in New York) and the mashed potatoes were actually pretty good. However, mid meal I found a hair in the food, and that was it. I was done. To summarize, awkward restaurant for 99% of public unless you're looking for a restaurant where the New York Yankees theme and overpriced mediocre to poor quality food is the goal. If you're looking for:- high quality food- a fun upbeat atmosphere - a nice romantic restaurant DO NOT COME HERE and choose a real steakhouse.",2,3,2,Dan G.,"Manhattan, NY",3,8,0
5.0,8/6/2014,"Even if I wasn't a lifelong Yankee fan this place would get 5 stars from me. My girlfriend and I went for dinner during restaurant week and everything from the atmosphere to the service to the food was excellent.Our server recommended the Double Play cocktail which is vodka with mint and other ingredients. It was very refreshing on a hot August day.For appetizers we got the garden and Caesar salads and they were delicious. For our main course my girlfriend enjoyed the roasted chicken with vegetable cous cous. I stole a tomato off of her plate when she wasn't looking and she got very upset so I can only assume it was very tasty. My entree was the 6oz filet mignon with garlic mashed potatoes. The steak was hot, juicy and delicious, and cooked perfectly.Despite the excellent appetizers and entrees, dessert stole the show. The creme brûlée was fantastic. Much larger than your average portion, the creme was creamy (I know that sounds obvious but it's amazing) and the chocolate covered pretzels were the best I've ever had.To go along with the great food was great service. I never felt as if we were ignored or forgotten. In fact, a couple managers came to ask how our meal was going which I always appreciate.We will definitely be going back to try the regular menu, especially the porterhouse with a bone the size of my forearm and chocolate chip cookie ice cream sandwich the size of my head (I'm fairly large to put it into perspective).

3.0,6/21/2014,"More like 3.5 stars.The Good:  Service is astounding.  Superbly nice and accommodated my request for special seating.  Came for my bf's bday and they printed out special menus for him that said happy birthday on it and really made him feel special.  Also checked up on us at the appropriate times and filled our drinks as needed.  As far as the food goes, i loved the little warm pretzel rolls (?) they gave with the mustard spread.  Steaks are quite generous and if you get the crazy rib eye thing, they personalize the bone with whatever you want written!  Good gimmick.  Steaks are tasty, but oversalted.  The outside is also a bit TOO charred.  If they just dimmed down the salt and their cooking temp, I think it could be a good competitor for steakhouses in nyc.  For dessert, we had the volcano thing and the creme brulee.  Both were awesome and again the volcano thing is just a great gimmick.  Who doesn't like a little after-dinner  fire show?  The heath crunch crust is quite addictive and pairs well with the vanilla ice cream.  DON'T EAT THE LEFTOVER MELTED ICE CREAM.  It's pretty much pure rum.  lol.The Bad:  Ordered the seafood tower for 2 as the appetizer.  Eh.  Seafood wasn't all that tasty.  It was a decent quality but just didn't have that oomph of sea freshness that I love.  Along with the steak, we also ordered the mashed potatoes and creamed spinach.  Mashed potatoes didn't have much flavor nor much substance.  It seemed very bland and on the thinner side (maybe using milk instead of cream?).  The creamed spinach was overwhelming sweet and had too much nutmeg.The Ugly:  PRICE.  Very steep.  Not a place I would visit more than once every 2-3 years, especially if the food isn't quite up to par.  And something that I thought would be obvious: we had plenty leftover from the ribeye with bone.  We asked to pack it up to take home and instead of giving us the entire steak in one piece with the nicely personalized bone, they chop of whatever they deem edible from the bone and just give the meat.  Some of the best stuff is eaten right off the bone!!!  WTF!!!  I'm pretty sure there was plenty of meat left on that bone.  plus the personalized bone is cool to take home as a souvenir.  Seems like such a simple thing, no?",1,0,0,Jinny P.,"Manhattan, NY",1,75,0

Our server Shawn was great and recommended the NYY Steak Corn (ok...amazing. Creamy corn cooked in bacon fat with bacon bits). Normally we have the Onion Rings and Lobster Mac N' Cheese, but this time we tried the Creamed Spinach along with the corn. For our main, we had the Bone-in Ribeye. It was cooked perfectly. To start, we'd also recommend the Prime Burger Sliders (from the bar menu). Beautifully cooked with Gouda and onion jam on a brioche bun. Yum. This special night concluded with a private tour of the basement dining area (like I said, we love when a restaurant isn't busy...especial for nice perks like this) by the manager Charlie.

4.0,1/10/2014,"Mark D below really sums of the vibe of the place:  yes, it's definitely Yankee-themed but it's not over-the-top and doesn't ruin a weeknight drinks vibe.So, I thought walking in I would either love it or hate it, depending on the kitsch factor.  I expected more tackiness.  Welp, I'm kinda disappointed but I kinda love this place for drinks at the bar.  Til it gets overrun with tourists, like every other place I try to have after-work drinks. Oh, TWENTY SEVEN wines by the glass because.... [________________________].**Yes, this is a trivia question.",1,6,0,Kelly T.,"Minneapolis, MN",325,809,9
5.0,1/8/2014,NYY Steak is a phenomenal addition to the NY restaurant scene. The food is amazing and the service is outstanding!,2,2,1,Raul A.,"Lynbrook, NY",10,1,0
3.0,1/7/2014,"Stopped in for a quick lunch and honestly didn't get the connection between the name and the Yankees until we were seated and saw NYY pics everywhere. Our waiter, ""Michaelangelo"" was very attentive and told us the answer to anything at NYY Steak was ""absolutely!""  Of course, being from LA, I put that to the test and asked him if he was a Dodger fan. ; )  He begrudgingly said, ""absolutely!""  I should have asked if we could eat for free...As for the food, it was too early for a full on steak induced food coma, so we ordered the chicken sandwich (really good) and the steak sandwich (not as good... and cooked to the incorrect temperature, which is unforgiveable at a steak house). I felt like the management cared more about the tables around us (with big ticket food items), as they asked the people at the tables all around us how everything was, but didn't seem to care about our experience. We also had to ask multiple times for bread when everyone around us got it unsolicited.Final score: Pretty good tasting food & Michaelangelo our server was great, but I didn't appreciate being virtually ignored by everyone else.",1,1,1,Keely G.,"Los Angeles, CA",831,298,99
4.0,12/30/2013,"4 stars. Started with the crab soup which was OK, but did not have a lot of crab in it. It was my birthday and ordered the Bone in Rib eye medium rare (cooked as ordered) as the entree (they charred HAPPY BIRTHDAY in the bone which was a nice touch), lobster mac n cheese, smash sweet potatoes which were all very good. For dessert ordered cookies and cream. Everything came in huge portions and I had left overs for four days. The service was great, but over the top. This is a must for any Yankee fan.",1,0,0,David B.,"Manhattan, NY",45,367,4
4.0,12/8/2013,"Its a NY Yankee themed Steakhouse: staff wear pinstriped shirts, linens are Yankee blue & white, side plates are baseball diamond shaped and pictures of Yankee players line the walls.   Despite these accents, the Yankee theme isn't intrusive.The lights are lit to a normal level and the ceiling is huge which gives the place a very open, airy and contemporary feel as opposed to other steakhouses Ive been to which are dimly lit and old world feeling. We ordered a few appetizers to start: tuna tartare served over avocado (very good), beet & goat cheese salad (very good), tossed salad (average, i mean its salad), and a crab cake (very good...not fishy at all).I opted for the Ahi Tuna dinner (i know, its a steakhouse), but it was a weeknight and I didn't want to crush my stomach.  Tuna was good, seared, and fresh.  The sides were typical of a steakhouse: creamed spinach...which is a favorite of mine, was solid.  We also ordered the smashed sweet potatoes which were good.The onion ring stack was OK, probably my only gripe....they are HUGE and battered which ultimately turned into a mostly hallow ring of fried batter with a little tiny shriveled onion inside.  There are better options.In the end I would say this is a decent addition to the steakhouse options of midtown.  Certainly has a more commercialized feel being part of the Yankee corporate umbrella but the food was good.",4,0,3,Mark D.,"New York, NY",68,64,17
