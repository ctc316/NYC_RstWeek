1.0,4/23/2019,"DO NOT GO HERE... plenty of terrific options around including The Smith, Izakaya Nomad, Kazunori, Ilili, Upland, etc.REVIEW: While the pasta was mediocre, (campanelle and gramigna are okay, tagliatelle was extremely bland), the absolutely horrendous service ruined our experience. Summary of our experience: - Waiter asked us to order on 5 different occasions within the first 10 minutes of seating (while half the table were using the restroom so had not had a chance to view the menu)- Did not bring us complimentary bread when we asked on 3 different occasions; proceeded to ask a different waiter to get bread- Paid no attention between appetizers and pastas (waited 30 minutes after finishing appetizers for pastas)- When we took all 3 of our pasta leftovers to go, he combined ALL of them into one box......",0,0,0,Andrew K.,"Manhattan, NY",0,2,0

4.0,4/10/2019,"Awesome spot we found after going to see the magician at the Nomad. It's right across the street and was perfect for what we wanted. We had an awesome server, Jay. Gave us great recommendations and he was super funny! We got the cauliflower appetizer (yum), potatoes (not worth it), the mushroom pasta (awesome) and the Brussels sprout salad (so good and super light). We were seated at the chefs counter, which was nice.. until I realized a super sickly girl was also sitting at the chefs counter and sneezing/coughing alllll over the food. I know that sometimes can't be helped, but still ... pretty gross. She was soooooo sick it was terrible that she was sitting right in front of where the food was being prepared.",0,0,0,Moriah K.,"Brooklyn, NY",74,86,30

3.0,4/6/2019,"Came here on a Saturday night and it was super packed, I had accidentally made a reservation for the wrong location but they seated the 2 of us within 30 mins no problem! Vibe wise, it was super loud but the setting is dimly lit and pretty romantic. I really like the interior. Service wise, they were pretty slow but the food made up for it. Food wise, we got the swordfish and the linguine. The pasta was perfectly al dente, the sword fish was alright (I don't have much to compare it to) I'd probably come back to try the place for brunch, but I think one dinner experience was enough (my boyfriend disagrees, he'd go back for dinner for the pasta)",0,0,0,Jennifer G.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",1,6,2
2.0,4/5/2019,"The restaurant is very nice and has a cool vibe to it.  We came close to closing time, but able to stay to have a quick bite.  We ordered arancini, minestrone and sides of eggplant parmesan.  The $13 minestrone was barely warm and lacked seasoning, although there were lots of vegetables.   The arancini were strangely sweet inside - not sure if they put sugar in the rice mixture, or honey?  And the eggplant parmesan was simply slices of grilled eggplant with a scattering of breadcrumbs and barely melted mozzarella. And again - just warmed, not hot!  They charged twice for a diet Coke refill.",0,0,0,Claire A.,"Central LA, Los Angeles, CA",391,34,4

The bread that was toasted was not too crumbly or hard; but the perfect crunch. The cheese is so soft and good as well.I would have given this place 5 stars, but we had a reservation at 1PM; but when we got there, there were no tables available for us; so we ended up taking a bar seat. The service is a bit slow, but is understandable as it is very busy. With all that being said, I would definitely come back here again!",0,0,0,Andrew T.,"Philadelphia, PA",11,35,19
5.0,3/31/2019,"The food here is delicious. I was in New York City for 4 days and ate here twice. The first night, I ate with my boss. For appetizers we had the tartare and meatballs. The tartare was fresh and had awesome flavors. The meatballs were to die for. Well seasoned. For our entree we both had the tagliatelle. The pasta is not homemade but it did not take away from the dish at all. My boss is Italian (born in Italy) and had no complaints at all (he usually does when we go somewhere with Italian cuisine). I came back Saturday afternoon for a late lunch around 3PM. It was crowded for Saturday brunch. I was able to sit at the chefs counter and get a full view into the kitchen. I ordered the Bianca negroni which was good, not at all too sweet or bitter. I asked for bread & the sauce from the meatballs to start. The waiter was a little confused but the chef complied with my request and it was DELICIOUS. Again, I had the tagliatelle because it is just that good. I do wish I tried other entrees in the menu but there is always next time. I was stuffed, so I asked for the tiramisu to go. Almost didn't happen because of the way the tiramisu is served, but I told Chef that I didn't care it looked as long as it tasted good. Got back to my hotel, had a bit of the tiramisu and slept for 7 hours straight.",0,0,0,Briana J.,"Dorchester Center, MA",0,9,8
5.0,3/11/2019,"I went with a group of 5 and we all loved it!The food was fantastic.  For our appetizers we shared a creamy burrata with a deconstructed pesto, an amazing roasted cauliflower with pickled raisins, arancini balls, and a vibrant, lemony brussels sprouts salad.Two of us had the yummy cacio e pepe, two the pasta special, and the last the scallops, all of which were great.  We didn't need dessert, but we had it anyway.  :)  The olive oil cake was very good, but the milk chocolate budino was the star.  Our waiter, Jimmy, was delightful. Funny, attentive without hovering, and he gave us great recommendations.  Although the room has a lot of hard surfaces, it was not loud at all, which is also rare nowadays.We will definitely be back!",0,0,0,Paul L.,"Manhattan, NY",0,14,3

3.0,2/10/2019,"Not about to wait two hours for a table at Eataly on a Friday night (whoops), my friend and I found La Pecora Bianca on Yelp nearby. The restaurant was full at 6:30pm but there were two tight seats open at the wine bar. We were elbow-to-elbow with our neighbors, but the waiter was extra friendly and accommodating. After taking a while to peruse the menu and pretend we knew which pasta to pair with which drinks, I ordered the tagliatelle with The Big Apple ($15 - cider + bourbon) and my friend had the campanelle with Forbidden Fruit ($15 - aperol, prosecco, + grapefruit). The Big Apple was perfect for the dead of winter, with the right amount of spice and apple. Although it took a while to come out, the pasta was delicious when it arrived. Pretty standard stuff with a solid sauce and filling amount. I was worried I wouldn't finish, but when have I ever not finished a pasta dish? Probably never. The restaurant itself is gorgeous with gold and turquoise accents -- that's the main reason it caught our eye on Yelp (that and carbs). It has a cool vibe and is probably enjoyed a bit better from the tables, but we weren't missing anything with our wine bar experience. I'd imagine it's even nicer in daylight for lunch, too! All around, it was a good meal with nice service and a sweet atmosphere, but nothing crazy special. The extensive menu is great for return visits.",1,0,0,Naomi D.,"Brooklyn, NY",70,79,112

3.0,1/30/2019,"So my coworkers and I decided to eat here for lunch being that it is restaurant week. We all had pasta.  I love me some pasta but unfortunately their pasta was a bit too salty for me. We all three thought so. We tasted each others plate and we agreed that all three different plates were salty, so I knew I wasn't crazy. I'm not sensitive to salt. I'm not the one to complain and return plates (I don't do that at all, maybe twice in my lifetime) but I couldn't bring myself to eat it. I had to tell them to make a new plate. I got a headache that's how bad it was. I felt really bad for telling them but the hostess was very professional about it. The chef fixed our plates. Will not be going back.

4.0,1/21/2019,"I have to preface this review with the fact that this place started off as a zero star-er in my book, and only escalated to 3 stars with the service provided by Miles (our waiter) and got a 4th star because it just so happened that the food that they were not out of (see for further details below) happened to be pretty delicious. First, upon walking in, while a manager/host was clearly standing directly in front of us at the podium and saw us come in, he did nothing to greet us whatsoever. Not a smile, not a 'good evening, I'll be right with you' not even so much as a head nod. Instead, we were ignored while he tended to his business for a good 3 minutes, then finally decided we were worthy of his acknowledgement. Uhhh . .  hello? You are literally the first impression of a restaurant. Second . . WHERE's the FOOD?! I am not even kidding with what I am about to list, but it seemed that literally everything we wanted to order was ""86'd"" -- see below. -Whipped Ricotta-Funghi-Broccolini-Smokeshow (yes . . they even were out of ingredients for the cocktails)-Tagliatelle (just the pasta though . . they had the accompanying sauce)-Scallops (initially)-Chopped Salad-CampanelleMind you, these are the things that we attempted to order. Who knows if they were in fact out of more menu items, and we just didn't discover it. Their excuse? ""It's MLK weekend - I think we underestimated how busy it would be."" Is this their first rodeo????Another con - - even with all of the ridiculousness above, they apparently ""can't add protein to salads."" If I'm willing to pay literally whatever you feel like charging me, why is this such an issue?Ok . . . onto the redeeming qualities. The restaurant is cute. I like the atmosphere. Definitely would be a great date spot. MILES. He saved the night. I think we were getting ready to stand up and leave when we heard the 20th thing they were out of, but he managed to keep us interested. Out of ingredients for the smokeshow? ""Yes, but I can actually have the bartender whip up something even better - describe what you're looking for."" (and he delivered . . . I have to say that whatever the bartender made, tasted even better than what the smokeshow sounded).""My trainee told you we were out of scallops, too? Hold on . . . I am going to fix that for you."" -- not sure how he actually pulled this off, but whatever the case, I'm grateful. He was honestly so good at his job and with the hospitality, that my husband and I were convinced he was the manager of the entire place until he revealed he wasn't. Speaking of which - - where the hell was the manager with all of this going down?! You would think that whomever was in charge, knowing how many food items they were out of, would take it upon himself to go from table to table apologizing for the restaurant's inadequacies. At least offer a free dessert?As for the food - HIGHLY recommend the pasta (whatever they have available at least), HIGHLY recommend the meatballs, and HIGHLY recommend the brussels sprouts. Burrata, cauliflower and scallops were good as well, but the first three were the stars of the show. So all in all, -Miles deserves a promotion-Bartender is creative; use it to your advantage-Food is great-Don't go ""on a busy night/weekend"" if you want all menu options available-Manager and host should be fired",0,0,0,Alyssa L.,"New York, NY",0,3,5

The whipped ricotta was out of this world. 2 of us had the Gramigna, my sister had the tagliatelle and our friend had the swordfish - we were all thrilled! The tagliatelle was outstanding.

1.0,12/24/2018,"So disappointed... was trying to go to this place for a while but finally went for a friends birthday. First of all,  I ordered pesto pasta and got the attached picture?? I was so confusOther than that, service was rude or either way up your ass. We also ordered burrata as an appetizer and it wasn't cheesy at all but the actual pesto on it that I hoped to find on my pasta saved the taste; my first drink (tequila&grapefruit) was so bad I reordered another tequila drink which was average. Basically, this restaurant is below average and average if you wanna be nice.

4.0,12/22/2018,"We were in town for one night staying at the New York EDITION and wanted to just walk some where for a simple, but well-put-together dinner. As it was a Sunday night, there was a good but not too big crowd and we were able to get a table right away. All the food was delicious and the service was good, but the dishes were a little small for the price. Not that I'm looking for overflowing or huge plates, but these were merely a few bites each and for the price we paid I wouldn't in we'd get a few more chomps on the fork.Still, we would go back as the taste of everything was just right and we'll know to order a little extra should we be hungry.",0,0,0,K M.,"Westford, MA",0,121,21

2.0,12/20/2018,"I was very underwhelmed by my experience at La Pecora Bianca. After hearing rave reviews from a coworker, I booked this for my boyfriend's birthday after another reservation fell through. Per other Yelp reviews, we ordered the cheese board, octopus, and two pastas (campanelle and tagliatelli). The cheese plate and octopus were very run of the mill, but the pasta was incredibly salty, and I'm definitely not sensitive to salt. Our waiter also left much to be desired - he rushed us through courses, taking my boyfriend's bread plate as he was mid-bite, didn't know the wine list well, and didn't offer up a dessert menu, knowing we were there to celebrate the birthday. Finally, when we asked for a box to go for the extra pasta, he said that he didn't recommend taking it home as it is fresh pasta and will go bad within 16 hours (fair to point out), but then when we insisted he acquiesced with a final ""don't call and complain if it goes bad"".",1,0,0,Anne M.,"Westfield, NJ",301,4,0
5.0,12/18/2018,"Honestly I'm a huge stickler for service since my parents owned one growing up and I waited tables for years as well as did event planning... so everyone knows that my standards are high. La Pecora surpassed my expectations!!! Our server David was amazing, everything  a server should be, most importantly passionate for what they do! The food came out SUPER quickly (so rare) and all was delicious! We had the octopus, meatballs, and GRAMIGNA pasta, and tiramisu and everything was delicious!!! The cocktails were on point too- so yummy !The pasta was the perfect balance of meat, vegetable (hard to find in entrees), and sauce. The portions were perfect. The tiramisu was $25 and we were skeptical but it's the holiday so we went with David's recommendation. Holy cow, it was HUGE for 3 people - but so so delicious. Even my friend who is a pastry chef herself said it was good and she's hard to please.The manager(s) stopped by more than once and that really impressed me. All staff members helped us (and not say, oh let me get your server) and the water jug never ran out (my biggest pet peeve).  At the end we lulled a bit and one of the female managers came over and nicely asked if we were done bc people were waiting and we were totally cool with that! She even offered to get us drinks at the bar if we still wanted to stay and THAT made my night. We didn't take the drinks but the gesture sold me. I am now a devout fan and since I plan most of my social outings, we'll be back!!!",1,0,1,de c.,"New York, NY",0,25,8

3.0,12/12/2018,"Very cozy restaurant with great choices on the menu (both food-wise and beverage-wise). I was a little shocked by how few BTG choices they had for wine, but not enough that I couldn't select a decent wine. I sat at the bar for a midweek lunch, with 3 other people at the bar and 6 total tables in the restaurant. As someone who works in the industry, this is considered ""not busy"". The service was bad yet somewhat attentive. I know that statement sounds stupid. But, what I mean is, the bartender was available but not interested in any sense of the word. Nothing was offered; I had to ask for a menu, water, a drink order to be taken, a food order to be taken. All the things I hate people doing at my own job. I felt annoying. And I'm not a needy guest by any means. I'm patient... to an extent. Once everything was in and I got the food, it was just plain bad. The mushrooms were boring and lacked flavor and the Gramigna tasted off. The glass of Cab Sauv I ordered had sediment all up in it, so I couldn't drink the entire thing, but the profile was good nonetheless.

2.0,11/24/2018,"It's really unfortunate that a restaurant with as great a location, menu and even server service has SUCH poor table management and concierge services. I find their concierge rude always, and the restaurant management has the poorest table management approach I've ever seen in my 10 years of living and dining in Flatiron. They OFTEN stuff three people into a two person table, in a corner with a ton of traffic, despite there being MULTIPLE four person tables available. There are often larger groups of 6 I've tried to reserve bookings way ahead of time, and we get cramped into a three person table every single time. And each one of those times there has been at least three or more unreserved, open larger group tables available. When requesting a table change, we're just flatly refused, even after they acknowledge that those tables are in fact available. Those tables remained empty through the course of the dinner - while we get constantly elbowed and nudged during our dining experience. I entertain a lot of out of towners,anagement and close friends, and it's unfortunate that bringing them here, on anything that's a well organized/planned meal or trip, is just not an option.",2,0,0,Shikha C.,"Manhattan, NY",93,45,18

Quite busy in the dining room and did not have a reservation but they were able to accommodate us at a communal table which worked out quite well. The staff is very well trained. They are all really attentive and very nice - the energy was great!Started out with the Chopped salad, (romaine, radicchio, olives, capers, grape tomatoes, chickpeas, sheep's milk feta), the Meatballs (beef and pork, tomato sauce and parmigiano) followed by the Linguine (rock shrimp, squash, lemon breadcrumbs and chili flakes) as my entree. All the food was really tasty and the portions are the right size, certainly for lunch, and I appreciate the pricing. I need to go back for dinner and also to check out what I think is probably a pretty lively bar in the evening.A quality meal that is well priced in a really nice atmosphere with great service - that's what we need more of!",0,0,0,Thomas M.,"New York, NY",0,35,74

Had my toddler with me, asked for a high chair. It didn't come. I had to ask three times.Ordered quickly and asked waiter to bring bread. He said 'oh I'll just bring you a kids pasta'. Said pasta took one hour to arrive, by which time my toddler was ready for a melt down. I asked several times what was happening and he said 'you're the next ticket' every time. Either the kitchen has serious issues or he forgot to place my order and was lying. I checked my watch and noted he'd said I was the next ticket 20 mins before. He said that was wrong and it was only 5 mins - incorrect and not how you speak to a customer.He then charged me $10 for the kids pasta despite never mentioning here would be a charge. When bread would have been free and quicker. So manipulative and unprofessional.At the end of the meal a glass broke. He was nowhere to be found - when I eventually went off to find him his reaction was ""oh great. Why?"" Again, I don't expect to be berated by an incompetent waiter, and charged full price for my food that took over an hour to arrive.I will not be back - they've lost my business for good.",1,0,0,Zan N.,"Manhattan, NY",0,8,1

However, we had to ask for bread after 15 minutes of waiting and they only gave us 4 pieces. Additionally, we were only given one bottle of water for our table which was not enough to fill all the glasses so kept having to ask for more bottles.

Next we shared two plates, a pasta and some scallops. For pasta we got the gnudi, which were herbed ricotta-filled dumplings in a buttery sauce surrounded by mint and peas. The pickled ramps on top made the flavors perfectly balanced. It was amazing. The carpesante (scallops) were some of the best I've ever had. Perfectly cooked, nice and soft. The roasted cauliflower,  and apples all paired well with it, but I feel like adding a sauce to tie it all together would help. It was a bit on the saltier side but I didn't mind. For dessert we had the torta limone. Our waiter said it was his favorite thing on the menu so we were excited to try it. Unfortunately, it wasn't that good. While the cake had a nice texture, it was a little dry. The compote on top was pretty sweet.  The overall dessert needed something tart to cut the sweetness down. I don't recommend getting it.

I  had my back to an aisle, and my chair was bumped several times rather violently by the wait staff. I scooched in as far as possible to a truly uncomfortable position. They still managed to bump into me aggressively. There was plenty of room on the opther side of our table, but they must have preferred this route.The cocktails were good, and so were the apps. We had the brussel sprouts and the burratta. The burratta was particularly well liked by our entire table.  It came time to order, and several things that we wanted were not available including the gnudi and the scallops that I had really been craving. After taking another look at the menu, one of my friends ordered the campenelle instead of the gnudi, and I ordered the black bass. We were all still very excited! Our waiter asked if we wanted a second round of cocktails. We asked to see the menu again, and he never returned...The hostess came by and took our drink order. Then our food arrived. It looked delicious. My company ordered pasta and they all thoroughly enjoyed it.According to the menu, the black bass comes with baby artichokes, and a red onion marmeleta. I took a bite into my bass, and realized they had served me the swordfish, which is on top of zucchini and topped with pea leaves. I was too hungry at this point and decided to just eat it anyway. A few bites into my fish, I crunched down on some bones! It was truly unfortunate because the fish was rather tasty. Given the price of the fish though, this is truly unacceptable. At the end of the meal, I let the waiter know and he said he was so sorry.We got about halfway through our meals before we realized that the second round of drinks still had yet to arrive! Once they did, we noticed that one of the drinks was not garnished as the menu listed -- they were out of that garnish too. We finished our drinks anyway and focused on getting out of this restaurant.When it came time to settle the bill, they did remove my fish from the bill, and they gave us free dessert, as it was one girl's birthday.

My friend tried it too and couldn't tell, and when I alerted the server she cautiously brought a new one which tasted completely different. Yeah, scary I know. I probably could have escalated this further but didn't.The service is very nice but spotty. When my risotto came out they asked if I wanted Parmesan cheese, I said sure, and it never happened. I finished my meal earlier than my friend who was only about halfway through and they tried to take her plate away. I also hate the bathroom situation. All the way downstairs with only 2 unisex stalls that there is always going to be a line outside of. Also, the hook in the bathroom stall is meant for someone who must be around 6' 8"" and I legit had to jump to hang my bag.

The sauce with a little watery vs other carbonara but it was meant to be like that with the cauliflower.  3. Brussel sprouts was also delicious. I wish it was a little more crispy but personal preference. The sauce came with a light sweet taste with a slight kick spicy. It had a little bit of an Asian twist. Good place to come.

The meatballs are reliably tasty, the pappardelle is also delicious. I've tried the scallops prepared slightly differently with seasonal ingredients on two different visits and they have been cooked impeccably. There was a hearty salad that one of our guests ordered and enjoyed as well as the Gnudi and Pork shoulderThe main floor can get a bit loud and they unfortunately don't have any happy hour specials.

Got the polipo, gramigna, tagliatelle and the cauliflower carbonara. The polipo was my favorite, but a small dish for what you pay. The gramigna was undercooked and perhaps the biggest disappointment for me, especially with the high recommendation it came with. The tagliatelle bolognese was okay, but nothing mindblowing. The cauliflower was meh as well, as it just tasted like boiled cauliflower in cream. The nutella tart is good, but not amazing. Go somewhere else. For $150, it was such an underwhelming meal.

3.0,3/19/2018,"Full disclosure: dropped by this place over restaurant week so food might not resemble ordinary menus!This is one of those restaurants with no apparent rival in the area and, despite its efforts to be good (and is indeed good), isn't great enough to take us on cloud nine.The place is on the spacious side for single dining room restaurants. First impression comes off welcoming, service was attentive and nice throughout the entire experience. You would want to try sitting by the kitchen; it's fun to watch professional and amateur chefs toss things around and get desserts ready.The food was slightly above average, but that's about it. There's some things not quite right with the savory pasta, which almost came off sauce-less despite the taste clearly being there. The texture is somewhat off putting and detracted points. The last course was an uninspiring pudding that didn't taste too bad, yet felt like the equivalent of cleaning yourself up with big box store soaps rather than, say, Aesop hand wash, which is the level I'd expect from a place like this.Overall this place leaves me hanging for more, and considering it's one of the few hot places around that part of Broadway / NoMad, I might show up again.",0,0,1,Wayne C.,"New York, NY",165,84,61

The food quality is acceptable, but be prepared to overpay for your food.Appetizers - Focaccia was probably my favorite with plenty of flavors, but still retaining the light spirit of the bread. Meatball was also pretty solid while I thought the steak tartare and cheese and meat plate were just average.Main - The gramigna pasta quality was nice and chewy, but the food came out really cold, and there was really nothing special about it that separated it from pasta at cheaper spots.The 28 day NY strip was also a bit disappointing. It came out slightly overcooked, and the steak could've used a bit more salt, which probably was the reason the steak wasn't as tender as I usually prefer it.Dessert - Probably the most disappointing after getting one of everything.

(Apparently, proper, good French toast is hard to find).  Also - being brunch - had their bloody mary which had a nice kick to it,  and peach bellini which was true to form.  I did NOT do their special ""all the bloody marys you can have in an hour special"", because we each wanted only one drink that day, but if you're in the mood, it would be worth it.  We made reservations, but wouldn't have needed to - at 10 am on a Sunday 1/14/18 there were lots of tables available, (but of course that might not have been typical).  By the way, at one point our waiter stopped by and made the observation that my wife's bellini didn't look like it was still all blended quite right, so he whisked away what was left and came back with a new replacement... that was nice.",0,0,0,Mike B.,"Roseville, MN",1,12,0

Sometimes simple is better!We split delicious (and sweet!) brussel sprouts, and grilled octopus to start. The octopus was perfectly charred.

The skin on the chicken was nice and crispy, and the carbonara was flavorful.My favorite part of the meal, though? The goat cheese chocolate mousse.

2.0,11/20/2017,We went here for dinner this past Friday. We found the restaurant to be cute and nicely decorated. We had a reservation for 7:30 PM and got there at 7:25 PM and had to wait until about 7:50 to be seated but I guess those things happen...On to the food. For an ap we got the meatballs. While they were ok (not fantastic by any standards) we paid $9 for three quarter sized meatballs. Even in NYC prices this is extremely overpriced.For dinner I got the Galleto which is sasso chicken. The problem that I had was that this was $26. It was two very small pieces of chicken and one of the two chicken pieces literally was all bones. Simply unacceptable. Basically I paid $26 for one small chicken breast with bones and one small chicken breast with a lot of fat and three small pieces of chicken. We left here hungry and for over $65 that should not have happened.My daughter got the Tagliatelle (beef and pork Bolognese) and that was okay  but not fantastic.Overall we felt that this was WAY overpriced for what we got and would not return.,2,1,1,Elise D.,"West Hartford, CT",7,148,58
2.0,11/19/2017,"Food is very middle of the road. Service is less than average. Negronis were ordered straight up both times came in rocks glasses and half filled, when transferred to their small martini glasses did not come close to filling glass. If your going to charge 15 or 16 dollars for drink at least make a decent sized one. If your hungry do not order the steak 2 small medallions of steak that were tough. The swordfish was good, however the waiter spilled the red wine in the dish and all over table. Thank God no one wearing white!  Waiter was not well informed regarding wines at all. The space is nice and ambiance is decent, however , when I called for a table they told us there was a large bar area so we could eat there unfortunately there are no chairs, but we did get a table in the bar area. Goes to show how these places really don't know food or the service to deliver them but charge as if they do. They did comp the swordfish. Would not g o back unless think change.

3.0,11/3/2017,"Very cute restaurant with okay service and okay food. La Pecora Bianca is massive and has a really cute Italian cafe vibe. They are open for breakfast, lunch and dinner - very versatile. I've been here for breakfast and it was pretty quiet and chill, but dinner is really busy and actually hard to get in without a reservation, which I did not expect. I've had breakfast and dinner here, and I thought the food was okay but not standout, and there are definitely some dishes that are stronger than others. The wait for the food is always SO long. Especially breakfast on a week day, where you want the food the come out quickly since your'e on your way to work, I was surprised at how long it took. Same with dinner - the wait time between our starters and entrees was way over what's normal.For breakfast I tried both the scrambled eggs with avocado and toast as well as one of the fritattas - specifically the sausage one. Both were on the bland side and the eggs were a bit overcooked. For dinner I loved my starters but was unhappy with my entree. We got the burrata, which was delicious - great cheese and great pairings, and the toscano salad - nice, fresh ingredients. For my entree I specifically asked the waitress for something light and said I was between the spaghetti pomodoro and the gnudi. She was pushing hardcore the gnudi and said it actually feels very light and it's a smaller portion, so I ended up going with the gnudi. It was one of the richest pastas I've ever eaten. The gnudi was incredibly heavy and it was covered in a thick cream-type sauce. There were only 5 gnudis or so on my plate and I couldn't eat more than 2 because they were so heavy and filling. There's no way in hell anyone would actually find this pasta ""light"", so if I have to guess I would think she was trying to upsell me.For the above reasons, I don't think I will come back here because there are much better restaurants within a 5 block radius.",1,0,0,Cat S.,"Manhattan, NY",447,371,0

The meatballs tasted mushy, not half as good as the same dish across the street at Pescatore. The mushrooms and peppers, well, what can I say. The mushrooms were really ""woody"" tasting--eating a branch. The peppers were hollow and flavorless. Instead of ordering more food, we asked for the check. The waitstaff was obviously well trained and knew a lot about the food, but maybe more than I wanted to know.

On the downside, the burrata could definitely be more flavorful/creamy and the steak, although cooked properly, was not as tender or flavorful as one might wish. It definitely needed a healthy dose of salt.

4.0,9/24/2017,"Dinner tonight with my husband at a neighborhood favorite, La Pecora Bianca. We have been coming here since this place first opened.  Always enjoyed the food, and the service has always been consistently on point.  Originally it was a bunch of guys who came over from The Standard Hotel, did the opening, stayed for a few months, and have mostly moved on now.  To be honest, we come here much less often recently, because the place became a bit of a scene.  For a while it seemed they were actually leaning into that, which alienated regulars like us, who became a bit frustrated at not getting a table after supporting this business when few others did. Anyway, tonight it's a bit quieter, which I like. We consider this a neighborhood place that we wish we could just stop in anytime for a meal.  Nomad has become so hot now that this is probably an unrealistic expectation.The good news - food tonight is excellent, service still completely on point.

It's the same exceptionally mediocre, snooty service but now with higher prices (for example: side of bacon is now $8, a 33% increase). Truly an insulting experience from reception to check. First, they stick their nose in the air if your reservation was made through open table. They made us wait while they argued about the dozens of empty tables that were clearly available. Then they cram you next to others in a section that must be just for opentable users. The coffee cups hold 3-4 oz and the waiters never refill unless you flag them down. We had to ask for refills 5 times. Then they fill it half way. Couple next to us had the same problem. The salmon frittata was over cooked and poorly constructed: the salmon and ricotta were clumped in one spot instead of evenly mixed. Did I mention the thing about the coffee?  Won't be returning. Relaxing pastel-drenched, Italian-themed ambiance in a flourishing part of Nomad.  I came for brunch and was delighted at the menu selection.  I had the whole wheat pancakes, which tasted fantastic (especially for whole wheat) - side of blueberries, blackberries and strawberries with whipped cream and syrup.  I highly recommend the side of bacon for $6 - you get 5 large thick-cut slices which can be shared among 2-3 people.  The coffee was pretty good, even though it's served in tiny espresso-sized cups.  The waiters were a bit slow to refill, and I felt that given the restaurant was nearly empty, the service was somewhat lacking.  I can understand some of the other reviews that mentioned poor service, particularly on a busy day/time.  But overall, I recommend this restaurant and we will come back for lunch or dinner one day.",0,0,0,B C.,"Manhattan, NY",0,16,0

2.0,6/11/2017,"The food was actually not bad, this review is mainly about the service.We sat down and it took a while for anyone to even approach us. We then ordered bottomless drinks (1 hour bottomless), which took over 15 minutes to bring over. We immediately ordered a second round, emphasizing that we were doing so because it took so long to get the first round. It took them another 20 minutes to bring the next round. Maybe that's why they have the 1 hour deal, it's impossible to get more than 2 drinks in an hour.Most of us got the burger, which was good. Not the best burger I've ever had but not bad. The location was also so loud - the high ceilings made for horrible acoustics, I couldn't hear the other half of the table.The waiter disappeared after bringing us the check also, it's like he was trying to get less of a tip.",1,0,0,Lindsey R.,"New York, NY",1,23,3

Last time service was nonexistent. Had a reservation for 6 people and still had to wait even though restaurant wasn't full - just bad time management on their part. Essentially had to hail someone down to order who repeatedly said, I'll let your server know. Every single dish was incorrectly placed in front of each of us. Pastas were ok, chicken was cooked to a leathery consistency. My water glass sat empty for about 45 minutes. After being ignored for so long, we decided to just get up to pay.

The tortelloni was housemade pasta stuffed with Fava beans and ricotta. It was absolutely fantastic and the star of the show. The funghi was unexpectedly one large mushroom... Very good and unique.

4.0,5/23/2017,"Came here for a Sunday brunch with friends for my birthday. In flatiron area with a nice bright space. Made a reservation through open table. The table was ready right when I got there, and the other 5 people slowly arrived and sat down. It was annoying because 15 min in to our reservation we were already arrived and seated, but no waiter came. We did not have waters poured for us and were not acknowledged. One of my friends had to go up to the hostess and remind her that we had all arrived. Finally we got a waitress, and the experience was good from there. We ordered the 3 assorted toasts, which included avocado, a croque monsieur type, and lox with cream cheese. All very tasty and great portion size for 5 of us. For my meal I got the sausage and broccolini pasta that was very tasty and a good portion. I was able to take half home. (I also ordered one over easy egg on the side.) Along with our entrees, everyone did the bottomless deal which is unlimited bellinis and bloody Mary's for an hour for an additional $20. You can switch in between, and our waitress was nice about bringing back more even past our one hour mark. At the end, we got the cheesecake dessert, which they put a candle in. Unfortunately, they don't serve their cheeses during brunch (only for dinner, which was a bit disappointing because I usually prefer cheese to more traditional sweet desserts.) they also only have one dessert each day dependent on what the chef makes.   When we got the bill, I checked to make sure everything was charged correctly, and they had accidentally charged us $50 per pasta dish instead of the actual $22 price. Big mistake!!! We let the waitress know and she fixed it. She said it was leftover from an Easter brunch special in the system or something. Overall, 3.5-4 stars because I definitely liked the food and prices were okay, but service was too slow in the beginning and I really didn't like the bill mess up. I think they need to hire more waiters during brunch time to serve all the tables because they were basically all filled when we were there.",0,1,1,Dana H.,"Manhattan, NY",766,296,1380

For $15 the portion was good and the flavors were delicious, genuine Italian food in the heart of NYC!

Well, apparently I don't when it looks and taste like simple ham and cheese - so sad.  The cauliflower was a bit overcooked for me and had too much of a mooshy texture.  Overall, perhaps $30 for a quick lunch isn't much in this area but the price certainly didn't meet the expectation.",1,1,1,Tatyana R.,"Brooklyn, NY",83,214,718

For lunch, they offer antipastis, salads, paninis, pastas and main entrees (burger, salmon, branzino and chicken). We ordered several starters which are great for sharing.  My party went HAM on the veggies but they do have meat/seafood apps.ANTIPASTIS* Asparagus - finely chopped asparagus with a soft boiled egg* Broccolini (*recommend, the romesco sauce that comes with this is SO GOOD)* Cauliflower - roasted in mascarpone, raisins and almonds (*recommend, probably my favorite starter out of all of the ones we tried)* Primavera - assortment of veggiesAs for entrees, I've tried the gramigna and the tagliatelle which are both pretty good.  Pasta was fresh and there's also someone that comes around asking if you would like freshly grated cheese on your pasta.   Overall food and service were decent...LPB is worth a try if you are in the neighborhood!",2,1,2,Shari C.,"Manhattan, NY",21,82,241

Definitely felt like a ""happening"" place to be. We tried the chicken paillard. What is paillard, you ask? The word refers to a piece of meat pounded thin and cooked on the grill. Seriously I felt SO healthy getting this all-protein-and-veggie dish. Fortunately for me, my lunch companion got the housemade tagliatelle with beef and pork bolognese. Which I promptly ate 3/4 of, while relegating my chicken paillard closer and closer to his plate. Major FOMO. Definitely get pasta if you're going. I'd like to come back to try to gramigna with sausage.Needless to say, the pasta was super delicious. I wanted more! Fortunately, he fed the cookie monster with a monstrous chocolate chip cookie.

They have a great bar where you can have a delicious meatball-, prosciutto- or vegan sandwhich for 10$ (you don't get it less expensive in any deli) or you can sit down and enjoy the full menu. Also their coffee and espresso is to recommend, as it should be in an Italian place. Only 4 stars because the seating staff could be friendlier and a bit more flexible.

As soon as we sat down, he asked to take our order. I literally just took my coat off and didn't have a chance to look at the menu, but asked for a round of coffee first. He then took forever to come back with our coffee and take our order as if he had forgotten that we were there, his demeanor was so aloof it was unpleasant for everyone. The food also took a long time to come, and not everyone's order came together. Not once did anyone come to ask how everything was, and we had to wave down the commis (who was refreshing friendly) twice to ask for coffee refills - clearly our waiter's job as she had to ask him for us both times. I wanted a small plate to let others taste my dish but could not get anyone's attention, so we ended up using our wet coffee plates. I was embarrassed that I took my friends here.

I was looking forward to trying this place since it's close to my office and seems cute from the outside, but when I finally did try it, I found the service to be a bit rude, and the food was just ok. It was pretty busy when I arrived on a Sunday, but I had to wait more than 5 minutes at the front of the restaurant with another group of people waiting behind me before someone greeted me. When he finally did, he curtly asked if I had a reservation, and then questioned me multiple times about whether I was sure which name it was under and for how many people it was made, until he actually found it in the system. He then told me to wait at the end of the bar and walked away. I waited with a friend for the other to arrive and after a few moments, he returned to tell us our table was ready. Except he did neither- he poked me hard on the shoulder (I was facing the other way) and asked in a raised voice if my reservation (again) was for the number of people I said it was for just moments before. He then waved for me to follow him and pointed to a table for us to sit down. When we did, the table rocked back and forth with one leg about 2 inches off the ground. When our waiter came to ask us if we wanted tap or sparkling water, without making eye contact might I add, I asked him if he could possibly get something to put under the uneven leg of the table. He interrupted me and harshly replied that he would take care of it. After these two experiences I resigned myself to the fact that this brunch would not be made great by the service at the restaurant, but I remained optimistic because of the referral.

We ordered a glass of wine since we were thinking it was going to be a while because it did look a little packed. In about 5 minutes an incredibly courteous staff member came to grab us. Usually, restaurants make you pay your bar tab before sitting you but he said not to worry about it, he didn't even let us grab our wine, he had someone bring it over to our table. It was a very kind gesture. We were seated in a corner near the kitchen. It was very intimate, which we loved. The ambiance was perfect. You could hear everyone having conversations, laughing and enjoying the holiday. Patrons were all happy.Having the open kitchen really uplifts the mood, too, at least for me!

2.0,12/19/2016,"Beautiful looking restaurant, good food, atrocious service.I've been here numerous times for lunch because, for better or worse, it's a convenient spot for a business lunch in the area. There are ALWAYS issues, and they have not worked themselves out over the past year. Last time, our server kept disappearing, everyone's food came at different times, then he forgot to put in one of the meal orders for the table (and then literally went to help out another table in the middle of when he was supposed to be figuring out what happened). And THEN, as they were clearing the plates, he just deposited the check in the middle of the table. He did not ask if we wanted coffee, dessert, anything. And when we were like uhhhh, we'd like dessert, he apologized and said that his manager was trying to get them to turn over the tables quickly. Considering the consistent issues here (this exact issue has happened to us before), I don't think that this is a problem with the staff. I'm sure that our waiter was pretty competent, just overworked and under a lot of pressure to turn over tables to get the $$$ coming in. He was clearly overwhelmed. It's a managerial problem, and it's just not acceptable.The food is really great and that atmosphere, though busy, is pleasant. But we consistently have issues with the service here. This is New York and there are tons of other exceptional Italian restaurants in the city. I don't think we'll be coming back.",1,0,1,Cay V.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,45,0

We had to get the avocado toast and I am so happy we did- it was basically bruschetta + smashed avo which was very very good. They even cut it in half to share! The entire party assumed we were eating eggs, but after seeing the pasta dishes come out we quickly changed our tune and I am so happy we did. I had the pasta with sausage, broccoli rabe and chili flakes. It was absolutely what I needed to warm me up on that freezing, blustery day. My boyfriend got the pasta with bolognese and it was one of the best bolognese sauces I have ever had. It was so rich in flavor and the freshness of the tomato stood out.

3.0,10/24/2016,"I came here for brunch with a party of 5, and it was nice, but not sure I'd go out of my way to eat here again. There are so many other brunch options in New York that are delicious. The ambiance was nice here, we were able to make a reservation for brunch, and the food was decent but not mind-blowing. The decor of this place was light and airy, with lots of windows, natural sunlight, and high ceilings. It was nice, clean, modern, and cozy all at the same time.The service was a little bit on the slow side and the food didn't come out particularly fast, so just take note if you're looking for a fast and quick brunch. Because we were just hanging out and enjoying each other's company, this was fine, but if you're looking for something where you'll be in and out in an hour, you may want to go elsewhere. I was slightly annoyed that the water cups were super small and not sure why they didn't just leave the bottle of water on the table instead of having to come by every 15 minutes to refill everyone's glass.Ricotta pancakes ($17) - These pancakes were made with ricotta and lemon and they were fluffy, and perfect to share amongst 4-5 people. Loved the berries and fresh whipped cream, and the light lemon flavor. We all loved these, and it was good for sharing. I think I could definitely eat an entire stack / plate all by myself, but then I would probably have a stomach ache and a sugar high.Kale Salad ($16) - Kale, baby carrots, pumpkin seeds, and a lemon vinaigrette. I could've predicted that this was just ""too healthy"" for brunch. It was good, but for $16, I didn't think it was exceptional. I've had better salads elsewhere that include protein and/or avocado for less than $16. This was fine, but it was a bit dry and didn't seem to have much going on. I had food envy with everyone else's food and would probably get something different next time. Save the salads for the salad places (like Sweetgreen), and just go for normal brunch food.Overall, this place was nice, and I'd rate it 3.5 stars out of 5. I'd come here again if people really wanted to come here and we needed a reservation at a set time, but don't think I'd go out of my way to come here again.

While originally we had planned to go to Palma for a girls night out dinner, 2 late-day joiners changed our plans late Saturday which also necessitated a venue and location change. Originally hesitant to go to a place that had last minute opentable reservations available, I took my chance and am very glad I did! This place is gorgeous in an almost HGTV Chip & Joanna/girls night out way - a welcome change from the traditional clubby/sleek/sophisticated Manhattan look with plenty of rosé on the wall with their own label, natch. The open kitchen keeps it cozy, waitstaff was attentive but not overly so, and the food was great in just the right sized portions. Oh, and the focaccia is divine - we had to request refills.

4.0,10/11/2016,"A very reliable brunch spot near midtown/flatiron. It's not a ""destination"" restaurant but it's great if you're in the area. The interior is bright and cozy, like a fancy farmhouse. Definitely sets the tone for their local, farm-to-table food. The farro salad is surprisingly tasty. Its nutty and nourishing, with little bursts of gooseberries (these are so interesting!) and tangy pickled onions. It's definitely more grains than vegetable though, so it's hearty. We added grilled chicken on top, making it a really nice entree. The pancakes are somewhat healthified but fairly standard. Definitely not a bad option and I always love fruit on my pancakes. The frittate is their take on a DIY omelette, sounds fancy but in the end it's pretty standard as well. Because ordering some sort of eggs benedict is always likely to happen at brunch, we got the uova in camicia - pretty solid as well, good quality smoked salmon and nice crusty bread. If you're feeling a bit more indulgent, the LPB burger is very good. The patty is really high-quality and juicy, topped with cheese and caramelized onions - you can't go wrong with that combo. The homefries on the side are slightly addictive, I just couldn't help picking until they were gone.Good atmosphere, good food, and usually no wait (reservations are easy to come by too).

It was perfect. We had an option to sit at the chef's counter (as walk-ins! - Thursday night), which was brightly lit and lively, but ended up eating outside because it was a nice night.

They sat us on time, service was attentive (great water refills) and the restaurant is so freaking cute.  Love the decor and feel in there.  I thought the restaurant week menu had good variety and value, and showcased the key dishes.We skipped on drinks but apparently cocktails are good here  To start, I had the crudo (a bit too acididc..I've had better). My friend had the kale and roasted carrot salad which looked plentiful and good.   I then had the chicken which was plentiful ( a TON of chicken), well cooked, and flavorful.  It could have used some greens but came with a good helping of corn. My friend had the beef/pork ragu taliatelle which she seemed to enjoy. I didn't try this.  They had their other famed pasta (the pork sausage one) on display as well as this branzino...For dessert, we both had the tiriamisu. This was the worst thing.. it was probably fine in flavor but I guess prepared so far in advance it was kind of hard. Not whipped enough.  Sounds odd but I got a (good, strong) coffee with my dessert and poured some into the dessert and it was better.   They had sorbet and some nutella cake as an alternative.I would come back to try others things and apparently they do good brunch.

2.0,8/9/2016,"Majorly disappointment all around - the only positive thing was the staff.We arrived promptly for our 7:30pm reservation and then waited at the bar for 20-minutes before being sat outside (they gave us a free drink because they were so delayed).  Unfortunately, we were seated directly below the exhaust fans of the restaurant's air conditioning system.  It's a summer night so it's a little warm, however, with the hot exhaust fans blowing hot air, it was EXTREMELY HOT.The meal was MEH (we got things off the restaurant week menu - $42 per person).  They served bread after 10 minutes of sitting there but with nothing else, no plates, no olive oil, no butter, nothing.  We had to ask for them to be delivered.  The restaurant also had NO outdoor lighting (and it was pretty dark before they brought out candles) - I could barely see our appetizers.  We both ordered their chicken specialty dish because the server raved about it.  Again, MEH - the chicken was hard to cut and OVERCOOKED (so overcooked, the skin almost took out a tooth - VERY HARD, like a pebble).  When we ordered, we asked the server to remove the mushrooms (as I think I'm allergic) and the kitchen still sent it out with mushrooms - and then when we returned it, she said it might take a while from them to prepare it (although they already brought one main dish out already for my friend). We had already waited over 30-minutes for a chicken dish because they said it would take longer.For the price, this honestly wasn't worth it at all.  It was incredibly disappointing and I would have rather gone to Dig Inn (across from the NoMad hotel) nearby, where the meal costs $10 and has better composed dishes served quickly.",0,0,0,Forest H.,"FOREST HILLS, NY",3,5,0

Their Tiramisu was fresh and tasted like the original Italian desert - amazing- Chocolate Mousse - can we say chocolate overload? I am a chocolate lover, but this had so much sugar I could not bare to eat two spoonfuls. And nothing amazingly great about this desert either.- Nutella Brownie was good, it was a little sticky but it was a good and authentic desert, if you are not a Nutella fan or turned off by the idea of Nutella on it does not taste much like Nutella all, the nuts in it and around it takes out the strong after taste of Nutella.

4.0,7/24/2016,"Very nice Italian restaurant not far from the Flatiron building. The ambience is luminous, the staff is attentive, their martinis from the full bar are excellent, and the food was most definitely above average (try their polipo, or their seasonal risotto).

4.0,7/21/2016,"Came here for lunch in order to sample the Gramigna and a couple order dishes I have on my list. Made a reservation in advance and was promptly seated without any wait time. Always a good thing. Very clean design on the interior. Really like the bottles of wine and pickles on the shelves with backlight behind as decoration. The menu is focused and concise. I wouldn't have it any other way. Ordered the grilled octopus, the charred cauliflower, the Gramigna, and Branzino. The octopus and cauliflower were both really good. The octopus was tender and paired really well with chorizo and olives.The Branzino was beautifully done with just the right level of salt. The skin wasn't quite as crispy as I'd prefer, but still very flavorful and fresh.Unfortunately, the Gramigna actually came a bit too undercooked. Had to send it back. It was a bit of disappointment since I was pretty excited about it. When it came back out the second time, that magic was gone...Overall, still a beautiful restaurant with really good food. Too bad about the undercooked pasta. Will be back for another attempt.",0,1,2,Alex Y.,"Fort Lee, NJ",681,535,2949

1.0,7/10/2016,"Our meal at La Pecora Bianca was a train wreck. A very slow moving train wreck. We were drawn to the restaurant by its well-designed space and consistent crowds. But inside we found an inept staff struggling to manage the chaos and below average food. We arrived on time for our reservation. The hostess asked us to wait a few minutes. We ended up standing for 30 minutes in the cramped entry area. Doesn't that defeat the purpose of having a reservation? Once we were finally seated, I ordered a glass of chianti. For $15, you expect a decent glass of wine. The pour was small and the flavor astringent. For appetizers -- we ordered the avocado & crab toast and the toscano salad. A few minutes later, the waitress came by to inform us that (1) they were out of the avocado & crab toast, but (2) she already took the liberty of ordering a different appetizer for us instead (without first asking whether we wanted it). Her explanation was: ""My baaaad."" But she said she'd comp the second appetizer, so we didn't complain about the bait-and-switch. The toscano salad was good -- nothing special, but definitely the best thing we ate all night. For the main course -- we ordered the tagliatelle and the chitarra. We waited at least 30 minutes between finishing our appetizers and when the entrees finally arrived. Both were underwhelming -- with low quality pasta, insufficient sauce and a general lack of flavor. And they arrived at room temperature. When it was time to leave, our waitress brought us the check for a different table. On her second attempt, she forgot she had offered to comp the bait-and-switch appetizer. On check #3, she felt guilty enough to take off a couple of drinks. The most succinct term I can think of to describe our experience at La Pecora Bianca is ""amateur hour."" Except it was more like an amateur 2+ hours. Whoever's in charge at La Pecora Bianca appears to have put most of their energy into creating a space that looks like a great restaurant, but does not actually operate or taste like one.",5,2,2,David L.,"New York, NY",8,13,0

The Gramigna was very good but not something I would order again just because I would like to try something else rather than eat it again.

5.0,5/29/2016,"I was staying in Chelsea for work in April, living out of hotel for a few weeks. One of my last nights in town, I stopped into a restaurant up the street from La Pecora Bianca. When I asked if there was room, a waiter snapped at me that the section was for hotel guests only and I'd have to go eat at the bar. The bar was a total zoo because it was a Friday and I was homesick and in an emotionally fragile place and I felt bad that I made this waiter upset by wandering into a place I shouldn't be but also I really did not want to be snapped at by anyone, all I wanted to do was eat a hamburger in a bar that looked like a library. I left and walked down the street, where I happened upon La Pecora Bianca. I hesitated because it looked like a nice restaurant, the kind where they had the confidence to serve wine in very thin glasses, because the people that ate there could be trusted with fragile things. I am the kind of person who only owns plastic dishes because I destroy everything I touch. In fact, I was certain the waiter at the previous restaurant had identified this quality in me, and it made me feel ashamed. Like I shouldn't have pretended I could belong in a restaurant with cloth napkins, that he was right to send me to the bar with the rest of the chaff. However, I really love pasta, so I decided to go into LPB and see if they had a table. I anxiously stepped up to the host stand. ""Just one,"" I said, waiting to be coldly asked for my reservation, or maybe he would just throw his head back and cackle, ""Do you KNOW how thin our wine glasses are!?"" Instead, his eyes lit up, and he smiled warmly. ""I have one chair at the chef's table right now!"" He said it as if he was excited to give it to me, as if we'd both won some sort of prize. The food was delicious, chef's table was so much fun, they didn't shame me for asking for a second round of free bread. I will not forget how incredibly welcome they made me feel.

The polipo (octopus) came with potatoes, peppers, chorizo, one almond and very little octopus. The dish was OK but the ingredients didn't come together at all. Main courses: If the appetizers couldn't achieve cruising speed, the entrees stayed on the runway. The bucatini special with tomato sauce featured limp pasta and an acidic tomato sauce devoid of subtlety. Gramigna, Einkorn pasta with sausage, broccolini and garlic had been cooked to include both chewy and mushy pasta. Again it was a dish that didn't come together. The parts stayed separate.

(The pasta itself was very good, perfectly done; the sauce was the issue.) The chef offered to make me another one - I was sitting at the stools by the open kitchen - but by then I was running late. I would have thought any chef that cared about his food would have tasted his sauce at that point, but he didn't. Couldn't be bothered, though at that moment things were pretty quiet and he easily could have. Giving this four stars because, to be fair to the restaurant, I've tried only one dish.

5.0,4/1/2016,"I don't understand why it took me so long to appreciate carb with cheese - now I crave the combo all the time! Hence - the reason why my husband took me to La Pecora Since our table wasn't ready, we were given the option to be seated at the chef's table aka high chairs overlooking the kitchen. Our host explained that they were his personal fav seats of the restaurant. Skeptical at first, we took the chance and gave in. After our dining experience however, we couldn't agree more! The seats were much more spacious than regular dining tables and much more entertaining in terms of seeing all the craftsmanship, creativity, and effort pumping into each dish! It also made our selection of dishes much much harder - every dish looked so tasty and worthy of a try. My husband and I each went with a pasta - gramigna for him and veggie lasagna for me. Both pastas were made to order. We were so excited to witness our dishes being put together. A little to much excitement maybe.. we couldn't keep our eyes away from the chef's every move.. Enough for the kitchen staff to notice and to begin explaining every step. Onto the food! My husband thoroughly enjoyed his gramigna. Perfectly cooked pasta, well seasoned broccoli rabe + sausages, and a dash of heat just for kick. His bowl was polished clean! My veggie lasagna sent me straight to veggie heaven.  Who knew a veggie dish can be so satisfying. The cream sauce elevated this dish beyond most of the tomato, meat based lasagna I've ever had. The portion size was just right - full by not grossly stuffed (although I could probably eat a second serving and still be okay lol). Wowed by the food we knew we couldn't leave without trying their dessert too.  Honey ricotta cheesecake! - after one bite, my husband almost didn't share. Its consistency was as light and fluffy as Japanese cheesecake. Perfect ratio of crust. Wished there was a few extra drops of honey. It wasn't as sweet as most cheesecakes we've had. And after devouring one, we felt as if we could eat another slice (probably even a whole cake) without groaning in pain. Hands down one of the best cheesecakes we've ever had!

4.0,3/20/2016,"For dinner, food is consistently quite delicious but the service can be terribly uneven. For example, your table is unlikely to be ready anywhere near your reservation time.  You may or may not get bread.  For long periods of time, no member of the staff will come anywhere near your table and then suddenly 2 or 3 very confused people might appear - a sommelier with wine you didn't request, a waitperson with no apparent role asking if you have questions, someone taking drink orders before the drinks that have already been ordered have arrived.But, oh the food makes up for it.  The chicken is amazing and so are the pastas and some of the vegetable plates like the beets.  The food has the baroque quality that a lot of NYC food seems to have nowadays - lots of ingredients and complicated preparations even of side dishes - but the overall effect is deliciousness.  I would also highly recommend the desserts",0,0,0,alan m.,"New York, NY",4,16,0

2.0,3/4/2016,"If I were to judge this place solely on the food, I'd give it four stars.  The food was good to very good.  We had the gramigna pasta (a riff on a traditional pasta dish from Bologna), truffle risotto, and fettucini bolognese, all of which were kind of lonely served by themselves, clearly designed to be accompanied by contorni (side dishes) or be mid courses before meat/fish dishes. We also had a bunch of appetizers to share, which showed that either the chef has a frisee fixation or the stuff was on sale really cheap that day - all of the apps were drowning in it - but they were all good, especially the pear.  Only the octopus was disappointing: not enough actual octopus, too much potato (and frisee).  The kale salad was excellent (no frisee on that one).The two-star ding is for their combination of poor service, smug attitude, and unfocused style.   First let's talk about the service and 'tude.  I came on time for a reservation I made on OpenTable; the other three in my party came later. The place was about 1/4 full (early reservation) but the host refused to seat me until the others were there. The waiter did his best, but his combination of forced-hipster-dude and over-pronunciation of Italian food names -- I'm guessing this is the ""house style"" -- was kind of disorienting. Servers never knew who ordered what. Apps came out on time but mains were way, way late, and one of the dishes had clearly done hard time on the pass before being served. The waiter compensated by comping dessert, which was nice of him -- but then he dropped the check right after the desserts came. I.e., we know we kept you here two and a half hours; now we need you to leave.  Finally, the style of this place: it can't seem to decide whether it's Brooklyn locavore, sophisticated Italian, or buzzy bar scene.  Interesting fusion if you can pull it off, but these guys don't.  I gather this place is new and very popular; wait until the hype dies down and maybe give it another try for what happens in the kitchen.",0,0,0,Bill R.,"New York, NY",5,97,1

2.0,2/12/2016,"This review is for dinner. Both my friend and I didn't like the food which is why I'm giving it 2 stars. I got a special - vegetarian lasagna. The waiter failed to mention that it had no tomato sauce. Instead of tomato sauce, it was only bechamel with a thick layer of cheese on top. I only had about 2 bites. It was SO rich and so salty. I would not have ordered it had I known it was smothered in bechamel. The waiter didn't ask if I had a problem with the dish after seeing I only ate 2 bites. My friend had the truffle risotto and said the risotto wasn't cooked properly. I'm not a risotto connoisseur and I thought it was ok/unremarkable (tasted like truffles!).Another issue was that they brought out the risotto first because they said it should be eaten right away. But my friend being polite, waited for my dish to come out (even though I insisted she start). By the time my dish came out 5+ mins later, her risotto had started to cool and had that weird film on top. I get that their intentions were good but perhaps they should have better time management skills in the kitchen.

1.0,12/16/2015,"The restaurant itself is bright and well-designed/decorated, but while the food was solid, the service was horrendous.We had a reservation for brunch on a Sunday and there were four of us, with three of us present five minutes before our reservation time. The fourth was delayed so when we went in we explained that three of us were there and that we'd be happy to start ordering so we wouldn't hold the restaurant up while the fourth member of our party made his way there. The hostess said she would ""ask the maitre d' "" if we could sit without all four of us being there, which seemed to make sense since we would use the same sized table whether there were three or four people in our party. (Aside: It's not the kind of restaurant that would call the host the maitre d', nor do I understand what the other person's job at the front desk was). After five minutes or so, I asked again if the hostess had spoken with her counterpart and she said ""Oh, I'll ask."" Another five minutes went by, most of which while she was side by side with her counterpart, and we started laughing because she clearly had still not asked. Finally, she stepped away and I asked the host directly if we could be seated (now 15 minutes after our reservation time) and he promptly told us that our table was ready and that the hostess hadn't spoken with him.Once we were seated and received the food, things were a bit better. The eggs benedict dish (poached eggs with prosciutto) was solid although the prosciutto was very ""ham-like"", and I had the stuffed pasta which was also good. We also had the basket of three pastries (cinnamon bun which was heavily frosted, honey apricot scone and cheddar scallion scone - they were out of the butternut squash muffin). Overall, no real complaints in terms of the food. In terms of the drinks, I would avoid the blood mary (all versions of it) at all costs. It tasted like someone blended 3 tomatoes, a stalk of celery, carbonated it a little bit and added some vodka. Not sure if it's just my taste, but there didn't seem to be any salt, spices or anything else worthwhile in there.In terms of the service, we were served by about three different waitstaff, and we couldn't tell who our primary server was, and there was a clear unequal division of labor between certain members of the team who appeared to be running around all night while others casually strolled about and acted like they were overseeing things. We asked to have one of the bloody marys taken off the menu because it was untouched and it wasn't communicated by the waitress who we spoke with about that and the waiter who finally (15 minutes after we asked for it) brought us the check. Last observation on here, is that the owner or GM was clearly present throughout the afternoon. It's the first time I've seen a popular restaurant in Manhattan where the owner or GM simply stands around, plays on his phone and generally doesn't contribute in terms of guidance to the staff, help while they are slammed, or seemingly any other effort. Makes me wonder if the issues with service stem from the top.While we were leaving, the bright hostess who spent our first twenty minutes ignoring us, really sealed our impression of the place. Instead of the usual, ""Thanks for coming in, have a great day,"" the only words she found herself able to muster, oddly enough, were: ""You made it!"" Yes, we certainly survived.

On the drinks menu I would highly recommend the Stromboli cocktail - always a hit. For food, the gramignia pasta is to die for. The appetizers are fresh - I really enjoy the artichoke dish and the cauliflower. Deserts could use some work, but the rest of the meal more than makes up for it. For brunch, the baked eggs are a must.Highly recommend this spot for a date, catching up with friends, parents, or even a meal/glass of wine alone. bravo",0,0,0,Lara B.,"Manhattan, NY",0,3,0

Macheroni was just a whole wheat pasta with basil and pomodoro sauce. It doesn't take much to make my belly happy. :) The Gramigna was the pork sausage, broccolini, and einkorn pasta. It was a bit too salty for my pallet, that i had to scoot some of the pork aside so I could finish my food. The restaurant was lively, and the staff were very attentive. I'll definitely come back again, and see what other delicious dishes I can try. ENJOY!",1,0,1,Darlene Y.,"Los Angeles, CA",518,1176,61

So I was actually looking forward to checking out this place since I lived in Europe for nearly ten years. I think La Pecora Bianca offers fresh, quality food at reasonable prices. The ambiance and decor are definitely a plus. The service could not have been better, and I am 100% sure that I will go back. For the record, I started with Pera, which were prepared to perfection. Then I ordered the scallops (Capesante). Well, let me tell you, I have had many scallops in my lifetime that were not quite right. These, however, were fabulous. One thing I really love about this restaurant is that the portion sizes are just right- not too big, and not too small. I could not eat dessert because I was too full, but I did sample my boyfriend's dessert, and his mother's as well. They ordered the Panna Cotta (quite original with lemon and lavender touches!) and the chocolate mousse which was out of this world. It is made from goat's milk- who knew?

3.0,12/2/2015,"I went with a group of 4 on a Tuesday evening last week. Overall the food and wine were great. We ordered the artichoke appetizer to share and each of us ordered one of the homemade pasta dishes and shared a desert. The pastas were delicious and the sauces were clearly made with very fresh ingredients. The only downfall was the service. While our waiter was attentive, he and the bus staff were constantly at our table trying to clear plates or glasses. It was very annoying and it was clear they were trying to get us out of the restaurant as quickly as possible to seat another group. Our check was put on our table before the desert even arrived! To me this is the worst offense a restaurant can make. So while the food is worth going for, their service needs some major tweaks. For starters making their customers feel welcome vs rushed out asap.  Also, a heads up, if you're going to dinner with a group, they insist your entire party is there before seating.

After she tried to convince me the Super Tuscan was a blend of Chardonnay and Sauvignon blanc I knew my night was going to be eventful. It seemed she was more concerned with her phone and looks than providing good service. Besides the poor service the Russian hostess was very rude and denied me a larger table for my party of three claiming the table had been reserved but was not seated once through out the duration of my meal. When my food came the crudo was practically inedible and gave me explosive diarrhea during my meal, being handicapped the bathroom was in accessible due to service repairs. My wife had to escort me down the stairs to the restroom as I held in my feces. When we asked for the check I received a receipt with 3 items that I had never order on my tab.

I think the lay-out can obscure details, like dropped forks and empty glasses.) The menu is conventional. That adds weight to execution. Unfortunately, the orecchiette came out dry and salty. We'll chalk it up to a cook learning a new kitchen...La Pecora Bianca becomes a café in the morning. This can be confusing. You can't sit down-chairs are stacked on the tables. The bar/counter can also get tight. But the tea is quite nice. I walked through their unlocked doors, today, a few minutes before they opened. There was one lady behind the bar/counter. We were the only people in the room. She told me to immediately leave.What? As a Swissman I respect punctuality. But there is room to be polite.

The crostino was a delicious flatbread that started the meal off right.For the main courses we had the whole wheat pasta, the tagliatelle, and a watermelon & goat cheese salad. I respect that fact that LPB took a chance with whole wheat pasta - it is not so easy to make it taste great. But when done right, as it was here, it is definitely more healthy and just as delicious. The watermelon salad was probably my favorite dish. Apparently watermelon and feta salads are a thing? I didn't know that.

3.0,11/9/2015,"KenScale: 7.5/10La Pecora Bianca is a new Italian restaurant in the NoMad neighborhood, from restaurateur Mark Barak and chef Simone Bonelli, notable for his stint at the world-acclaimed Osteria Francescana in Modena, Italy. If you're expecting the haute Italian cuisine from Osteria Francescana, you won't see any of it. It is a rather more straightforward coastal Italian food with some modern twists. I felt that overall execution was somewhat inconsistent, some dishes that were nicely done while others that had too much going on and hurt the level of satisfaction.The menu consists of a number of starters, salads, pastas and main dishes. I was intrigued by scallop crudo with goat's milk whey and pomegranate but it turned out largely tasteless and the texture of scallop was weirdly off. Charred figs with sheep's milk ricotta and hazelnuts, on the other hand, were nicely done with well-balanced flavor and texture. All the pastas, according to the restaurant, are made in house from organic grains. I tried gramigna pasta with einkorn wheat accompanied by pork sausage, broccolini and chili flakes. It was a serviceable dish, but not a particularly memorable one. I was hoping to get a bit more spicy kick, but the dish overall turned out a little bit more oily than I thought. On the other hand, I enjoyed roasted chicken with creamed autumn greens and wild mushrooms, which was cooked moist and tender and the seasoning was not overpowering to my liking. Of the desserts, ricotta cheesecake with extra virgin olive oil, raw honey and cookie crumble was delightful, but the parmesan crème brulee was confusing; I understand it's made with parmesan, but I didn't expect the entire cream below to taste like real cheese instead of some sweetened version of it. The restaurant has a really nice, trendy vibe going on with lots of young, handsome crowds. Make sure to make early for table or try your lucky at the counter seating in front of the open kitchen, which is set aside for walk-ins only (I actually snagged seats at the counter, and enjoyed the dining experience here more as I usually do at restaurants with open kitchens). There is Italian-focused wine menu where you can have a glass or two to go along with the meal. La Pecora Bianca is the type of restaurant that probably works best for casual hang-outs in the NoMad neighborhood, but I wish the food could be a little more well-executed consistently to make it a worthwhile destination. It is at least a nice place for sipping a glass or two of wine along with snacks in a chic décor.",4,0,0,Ken S.,"Manhattan, NY",512,612,4738

1.0,11/1/2015,"This is for the hostess alone because she wouldn't seat us so I have no idea about their brunch menu. My boyfriend and I walked into La Pecora at 10:15 AM. I had previously looked at Opentable for reservation availabilities, which were plentiful. I decided to skip the reservation as 10 AM is always a slow time for the brunch scene. I walked in, the hostess asked if we had a reservation I told her no. The restaurant had about 4 tables occupied, all other tables were vacant. I assumed the question about the reservation was just a formality. Nope! The hostess hesitantly looked around the room as if it were packed and she couldn't see a table available. She turned back to me and told me she didn't think she could seat us, and she'd have to check with a manager. Um ok???? So we sat at a long marble topped high top table, right next to the hostess stand. The hostess never asked the manager. He actually walked by twice, but apparently she was too busy to ask because gazing into thin air takes so much energy. After 15 minutes, no new customers coming in, and no chance of being seated in one of the many empty tables available, we left and ate breakfast at Maysville (great option and just across the street, highly recommend). We passed by La Pecora an hour later. I looked in just to see if there was any acceptable reason the hostess wouldn't seat us. Maybe there was a party of 50 that came in? The restaurant had gained maybe 4 more tables, but was still completely empty. Having worked at many restaurants and at food centric publications, I'm actually astonished by the horrible service at this restaurant. I say skip La Pecora and go to Maysville across the street.

3.0,9/27/2015,"New-ish modern Italian restaurant in Flatiron. Beautiful lighting, tile and interior decor - the space alone merits three stars. The food, however? A bit overpriced for the rather simple dishes that come out of the kitchen.The appetizer ""Crostino,"" a spread of Ricotta with sausage in romesco sauce, was well-seasoned and balanced although a small portion and rather simple to merit $12. The Einkorn Gramigna pasta had just a kick of chili flake that contrasted well with the heartiness of sausage and broccolini. Tagliatelle was more simple with a rich, creamy bolognese sauce. Both are $18-20 and, while well-executed, are certainly not the kind of memorable knockout dishes the restaurant will become known for. The chocolate mousse with pistachio crumble was fantastic! Maybe desserts are their thing? Service here was impeccable, and the wine list is one of the best in the area. Crowding is definitely an issue at Pecora Bianca. Most of the tables are so close together that you're basically seated on top of your neighbors, making intimate conversation difficult. In all, Pecora Bianca is a well-run establishment with simple, elegant Italian food in a beautiful space. It is priced to reflect rents in the area and, while it has potential, Pecora Bianca is merely good while other similarly-priced restaurants in this area (e.g. John Dory, Hanjan) stand out as truly great. A great place for a casual, but upscale meal, though not yet a destination in its own right.",2,0,1,David P.,"New York, NY",79,151,26
4.0,9/22/2015,"Had a girls dinner here last week and really enjoyed it.  Our waiter walked us through the menu and made sure we knew the highlights.  We ordered the Pesche and Crostino to start.  Both were very good, and the Pesche was a nice, fresh appetizer not seen in many italian places.  We then split the Tagliatelle, Gramigna, and Fish of the day.  I really enjoyed the Gramigna, very different than what i would order at other italian spots, but had a good rustic italian feel.  The fish of the day was incredibly fresh and the tomato confit complemented it perfectly.Overall, will definitely go back!",0,0,0,Lisa B.,"Civic Center, Manhattan, NY",172,9,0

1.0,9/18/2015,Not worth your time. Was seated and had to hail our own waiter after sitting around for 10 minutes without being given water or our menus.. And the person next to us was still waiting for her friend and she got water. Lame. Pasta sucked and it was too chewy and salty. Even for al dente. Might as well make your own pasta..

3.0,9/9/2015,"I feel bad about not giving a better review as everyone, well almost everyone, was very nice but man do they need to get their service issues worked out. We walked in early for our reservation on a Saturday night and grabbed a seat at the bar. The area behind the bar seemed a bit messy and disheveled which I noticed right away and the stand up tables in the front make it seem a bit too casual for what I was thinking they were all about. I was hoping for a nice Saturday night date night and felt like I walked into a super casual afternoon type drink and apps spot. We ordered drinks at the bar, the serrano which was good, very light and the stromboli which was also good and very light. Our table was ready, a two top squeezed in the back amongst the other two tops but hey the place isn't huge. Our waitress was friendly enough but basically just recited the menu instead of really telling us anything about it. One of my biggest wine pet peeves happened after I ordered a bottle, bringing me an entirely different vintage than was on the list. I originally ordered the Castello di Luzzano Bonarda that I was told they were out of. I then ordered the 2009 Aldo Rainoldi Sassella Valtellina Nebbiolo and the wine steward brought me a 2014, quite a difference. I turned it away and asked for suggestions. He pointed out a few bottles that were quite a bit more than the two I had ordered, not that I have a problem spending for a great bottle but I wasn't confident that he knew all that much about the list. I went with my own 3rd choice which was the 2009 Polvanera Aliganico which was perfect. For food we started with the charred peach salad which was fabulous, the ricotta amazing. I was a little miffed they don't offer any bread of any sort to start. Next up we had the Einkorn Gragmina which had it been served warmer would have been excellent. One runner tried to serve our secondi before we received our pasta and then immediately took it back...you know where this is going, I knew it was going to sit up under the heat lamps until we were ready and that's exactly what happened. We had ordered the Galletto and the first bite was so dry I couldn't even swallow it. Everyone was extremely apologetic and replaced it, which I give them high marks for, even comping dessert but the next one came out dry as well? I happen to love Claudette, their sister restaurant which baffles me that this place can be so lacking. The effort by the staff definitely brought the star rating up but it was a disappointing Saturday date night.",0,0,0,Leslie S.,"Los Angeles, CA",82,444,2

Over an hour late.And then the kitchen was backed up so we kept getting lots of free ricotta apps and wine repours (which was nice) but no sign of the food.When food arrived it was ok, but not special.

1.0,8/27/2015,"After reading an article in NYT and a place on Eater's ""hottest restaurants in Manhattan August 2015"", I was excited to try Pecora. Its pretty clear that the owner paid for said articles to be written because this place is extremely underwhelming.The pasta could not be handmade: maybe once upon a time before it made it's way into a box. The Maccheroni actually tasted gluten-free. We didn't even finish it and we were really hungry.'The Misto was fine, albeit stale bread.Lastly, everything we ordered seemed to sit in a pool of (pretty nice) olive oil.  The best of our dishes--the Crostino, a piece of toast with 'nduja and ricotta--sat in a serious pool of (nice, but far too much) olive oil. It made us both a little sick. We mistakenly ordered a bottle of wine which we are now brooding over as I write this review from the kitchen where I am watching what looks like a train wreck with the exec chef yelling at his crew in front of guests. I get this is the name of the game but maybe not in an open kitchen of a new restaurant still working out quirks. I cannot believe I'm about to pay $140 for some cheese, boxed pasta and mediocre wine. Prove that the hype is real and that you're not just trying to confuse Japanese tourist overflow from Eataly. Or go home. .",5,2,1,Dani H.,"Los Angeles, CA",217,56,4

1.0,8/26/2015,"Have been watching the construction at La Pecora Bianca all summer, and was excited for this great looking restaurant to open in my neighborhood.  The menu looks great, and it is associated with Claudette, which I love.  I came here around 7 on a Tuesday night to see if I could get a table for two.  The host quoted 30-40 minutes, which sounded fine, so we went somewhere nearby to grab a drink.  After close to an hour passed, we inquired how it was looking, and it seemed we'd be coming up soon.  The host was generally pretty aloof and distracted, and they seemed to be holding tables empty for reservations for much longer than most restaurants would.  After an hour and twenty minutes passed, we checked in again, and he said we were next, as we had been for the past half hour.  At that point we gave up waiting and decided to go somewhere else in the neighborhood.  Although Pecora Bianca looks promising, I expect better operations to go along with the seasoned team and the detail-oriented decor and press / social team.  I'm hoping these are kinks that will be ironed out ASAP.  I'll give them another try, but I'll do so when I'm not starving and have nowhere to be after.",1,0,0,Lauren L.,"Manhattan, NY",88,235,0

I tried the lobster ravioli and it was good, not something I'm dying to go back for though. The mushroom appetizer was pretty interesting although when we asked our server about it, all she said was it was ""interesting"" - we weren't sure what that meant but tried it anyway!

3.0,8/19/2015,"Beautifully executed space, great atmosphere. Service needs to be trained in a little more to cary themselves with more confidence and ease. They should also in a heartbeat know if the fish they serve that night is farm raised or wild. Portions are deceivingly small and ultimately we left the restaurant feeling hungry after two plates each /including a pasta dish/. My husband ordered a negroni as his apperitivo drink while we waited for our table and it arrived in a small whiskey glass which had more ice in it then the actual liquid itself.

Chef staff was great about it. We had the char which was amazing with the vidalia onion dish also amazing.

I want more!Emmer Macceroni- Amazing as well, I'm not a mushroom fan and I loved the ""Hen"" mushroomsSeasonal Risotto- I love Risotto but wasn't super impressed by thisWhat's not on the online menu but new is the scallops- these where amazing, so amazing we got seconds.We asked our waitress if they will be opening for lunch and she said in the fall. I'd come back to try the lunch and again for dinner. We didn't try any desserts because we ate too much pasta!While the food was amazing the starters seem to be lacking- like maybe they need to add a good meatball dish or something.

It's amazing. Spreadable meat - yes please. Einkorn gramigna - adorable to look at - looks like the restaurant's cartoon sheep's coat (on purpose?). The pasta is cooked nicely to al dente. The accompanying butter based sausage sauce paired well with the pasta. Cipolle - sweet little roasted onions.Carote - even though there were only 6 one centimeter wide carrots, these tasted and looked great.*Beverage*We ordered a sauvignon blanc and chianti to go with our food.

4.0,8/10/2015,"A very welcome addition to the area above Madison Sq. Park, this beautiful summery restaurant is a great alternative to the over-crowded Eataly when you have Italian food in mind. The high ceilings, ceiling to floor windows, sleek white interiors, seafoam green accents, and mirrors all along the walls comes together beautifully and gets you in the mood for wine and light fare.My friend and I had small appetites that evening, so we ordered the Pesche (grilled peaches, drizzled with a sweet balsamic, topped with candied lemon zest, sitting atop the smoothest ricotta) and a Red Fife Tagliatelle to share. The peaches were beautiful, the lemon zest helping to cut through the ricotta and adding beautiful flavor. The Tagliatelle was dotted with large chunks of ragu and was simple. However we waited so long for the staff to find cheese for grating, that the pasta was cold by the time we finally dug in. The dish was small, but they definitely live up to their promise that their pastas are handmade with rustic grains. You could actually see and taste the roughness of the grains.  Our waiter, who claimed to be from Italy, brought our small menus over and helped break it down. The wine list is more extensive than the single-page food menu so it should be easy to peruse. The dessert menu was also quite small (chocolate mousse, panna cotta) and there was nothing new that I felt compelled to try. Would come back if I wanted a light meal with someone, as the atmosphere is great and there's nothing like this in the area (although it wouldn't be as distinct in the West Village).",6,0,1,Jessica H.,"New York, NY",556,117,97
3.0,8/6/2015,"This new Italian restaurant was fine, but they're not really doing anything different than any other similar joint out there. If it's not something unique or interesting, it should be done exceptionally well, but some of the pasta here and the small menu was a bit mediocre.The space itself is very nice and fits in well with the current ""summery"" description given for all restaurants opening right now: high ceilings, big windows and bright.You can start off with a bunch of meat and/or cheese plate combos, as well as a few salad options and other antipasti that are mostly veggies. Then there are the pastas, just three entree options and a couple sides. We mostly just ate pure carbs though:- Crostino ($12)The only app that wasn't just veggies (aside from a crudo), this crispy toast topped nduja and stracciatella was a pretty delicious start to the meal.(After this, it took a solid 20 minutes or so for any food, which was a little hard to take).- Whole Wheat Chitarra ($14)I always forgot that whole wheat pastas are the worst choice of all pastas. They just don't taste as good, so I'd skip this one.- Red Fife Tagliatelle ($15)This one was a bit better, with the wide noodles drowned in a ton of the beef and pork bolognese.- Einkorn Gramigna ($15)Lastly, this one was the best by far. With pork sausage and broccolini, you could taste the butter, which was a good shot of flavor over the other two much more subtle ones.As for dessert, it looked run of the mill with just two very standard options (a chocolate mousse and a panna cotta), so we skipped it.Service was great and very friendly, but the food just wasn't particularly memorable, at prices that were fairly high for what it was too. Unless they start serving some killer fried chicken sandwich at lunch or something (very possible these days), I don't feel the need to return.",23,7,11,Mike C.,"Forest Hills, NY",5000,1694,69834
1.0,8/5/2015,"High expectations ... big let down !!!(Keeping it brief)- Service was very slow to get the food out.- Food was awful:                   Peaches as an app was super small for $12 and not very tasty. Plus it was plated in the same plates we ate in.                    Emmer Maccheroni lacked salt, beans were not cooked through, and the dish doesn't go very well, not very appetizing.                   Risotto was very liquidy and again very plain.                   Rainbow of carrots was okish. Again, very small portion.I commend the restaurant trying to make it a healthy Italian restaurant, but it doesn't work here. Spent $28 between 3 people and we had to go elsewhere to finish our meal. Hope they take this as constructive criticism and improve on the food. Decor is nice. Maybe you will have better luck with meats and seafood here.",1,0,0,Samir K.,"Smithfield, RI",64,20,0
2.0,8/5/2015,"This place has just opened up next to where I work. I was so excited when they finally opened their doors and used my break to run over to grab some food to bring back to my office. The interior is very nice! I love the decor and the atmosphere. I went in asking if I could order something to-go and the waiter said he didn't know and had to check, which was fine. Of course when a restaurant first opens you can expect some hiccups and general chaos. He came back and told me yes I could order take out so I started to look at their menu. Everything sounded so good and I'm very indecisive so I had to take my time selecting the perfect dish for my first taste of La Pecora. When I was finally ready to order the woman at the door told me they did not do take out orders and that I had to be seated to get food. I explained to her that the man standing there earlier had already gone into the back to ask and that he said I was able to. She didn't ask the original waiter who told me yes, or even bothered to ask for herself. She only refused to let me order food. I asked if someone seated didn't  finish their meal and wanted to take it home, do they refuse them their left overs? She only responded that they will eventually have take out but they ""don't yet"". I was not happy about having my break time wasted. This place is quit busy so I'm sure the food is good but until I can try it for myself, I can only give this place 2 stars based on their level of service, which was poor.",2,0,0,David P.,"ASTORIA, NY",1,47,22
