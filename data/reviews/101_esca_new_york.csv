1.0,5/1/2019,"This is a classic Italian restaurant in the theater district, and should be a great place for before or after a show.  Unfortunately, their food is beyond disappointing.The service is very professional, in a European snobby way, and their pacing was fine.  The ambiance was lovely, classic white tablecloths, good spacing between tables, bland but inoffensive decor.  And then csme the food.The drinks were acceptable, but a bit on she small side.  Black olive appetizer was good, but almost impossible to eat without getting oil on your fingers, the tablecloth and the menu.  The appetizers were probably the best thing on the menu, but still, nothing to write home about.My two guests each had a different pasta.  The pasta was cooked nicely al dente, but the sauces were bland and without any distinction.  I cannot say the sauces were bad, but the flavors did not excite you and were forgotten the moment you were finished.  The biggest disappointment was my main of Sicilian seafood stew.  There were precious few fish pieces, a few shrimp and some clams and mussels.  These were swimming in a thin sauce that was bordering on foul.  I was able to only take a few spoonfuls and then I had to be satisfied with the mediocre fish.  I left most of the dish.  Do not order this dish, as I do not think it will get better.In short:  Nice location.  Nice ambiance.  Nice service.  Lousy food.  Hey!  I thought that this was what I came to a restaurant for.",0,0,0,David P.,"Narberth, PA",10,30,0

1.0,4/2/2019,"We live a block away and I've been wanting to try this place since its got a lot of talent on its side....but wow, awful on every level. First the ambience. I felt like I was in the builder grade track house if that makes sense. Like cheap generic wall sconces, blase paint, etc. There was nothing special, creative or anything that made me want to stay here to eat. Second, and most important, the food. Okay, the food is probably more of a 2-3 than a 1 star. We started with the grilled squid, which typically is one of my favorites. It wasn't horrible, but it was definitely chewy and tougher than what you would expect from a professional chef. For our entrees I had the Spaghetti and my partner had maccheroni alla chitarra. The spaghetti was less than thrilling, especially for $32. I make better spaghetti at home. The lobster came in the shell and was tough. When trying to get it out of the shell,you had to pull pretty hard, flicking bits of sauce and lobster. The maccheroni alla chitarra had a pretty good flavor, but it was noodles sitting in a bowl of melted butter. Like literally, just pools and pools of butter, it was so gross. The restaurant attempted to rectify the broken butter sauce but my partners appetite was completely ruined.Then, we had our credit card out, ready to just leave and get this experience over but we sat for probably 30 more minutes being completely ignored. No drink refills, no check ins, nothing. We were sitting at the front too, right by the host stand. They took my partners food away when he said he didn't want it, so he's just sitting there. I was completely not interested in the spaghetti since it was nothing special and really not that good-so it was pushed out in front of me. Again, our credit card was out...and yet the manager, our server and every other employee would just look at us and look away!Seriously a horrible horrible dining experience! I expected so much more from this place!",0,0,0,tillie t.,"Beverly Hills, CA",172,18,0

2.0,3/15/2019,"Food(2/5)- My friend made reservation for me and stopped by for dinner. I tried this place for the first time. We ordered bunch of foods, 3 Pemaquid Oysters, 3 Sweet Neck Oysters, shrimp sashimi, hamachi, urchin, spaghetti, Perciatelli, linguine, day of special dessert, ricotta bomboloni also Puligny Montrachet wine. They have great selection of wine and I personally like white wine than red wine. I didn't eat raw foods but only I could eat oysters or Korean crab. Their oysters was not good as I expected but sweet neck oyster was better tasted than pemaqhid oyster to my licking from probably I like sweets. I didn't try any of hamach or urchin or shrimp sashimi but my friend said just ok but not the best. Linguine was too salty to us and I've eat better linguine anywhere else. Spaghetti was just ok but I would saying lobster was fresh. Their seafood was really fresh. I would recommend try perciatelli if you gonna eat pasta. That pasta was decent than other dishes. I thought if this place foods were less salty then I would love enjoy eating their dishes. I couldn't decide with dessert menu but they recommended me to special dessert and I really liked their recommended me that. It was pretty amazing tasted and I was impressed. It not a cake or brisket and I'm not a fan of pistachios but it really different flavor. We didn't take their any of recommendation about wine and just we choose randomly but it just ok. I thought over priced than quality. Service(5/5)- All the staffs were accommodating and super friendly. They're always around you for you ok with their foods or service. I really appreciated our wine or water wasn't empty and we didn't have to asked them to that. The guy, I thought he was manager at this place, he was funny and super duper friendly than other staffs. We really have great time from them and it felt like we known them from long time which means they make you really comfortable or enjoy their foods while you stay there for eat. They will share your foods from their kitchen if you want to. They're served our every foods separated plates. Ambience(3.5/5)- This place is classic Morden and clean place. I liked their music it wasn't too loud and you can talk with friends or anyone. Some of places are difficult talk with friends but this place wasn't. They have cherry blossom tree and I thought it pretty when they are fully come into. Overall(3/5)- I really like this place but I don't thinking go back to this place for their foods, if I go back to this place probably for their service.",1,0,1,Jae H.,"New York, NY",25,292,1253
5.0,3/9/2019,"Just a wonderful pre theatre meal. First impression when we arrived at 545...the music, ranging from the Dead to Simon and Garfunkel to Johnny Cash...just perfect, the soundtrack of our lives. Comfortable corner table. Service attentive if a little strange - a number of people were assisting us at different points. Our server (Kate, I believe) was warm and attended to all our questions. As for the food...pretty perfect. Great breads including a killer focaccia. Nice little amuse bouche- a tasty white bean bruschetta. My wife had the sea urchin crudo app and the pesce azzurri ( four fish selection) for her main. I had the grilled octopus appetizer (giant white beans and Corona lemon) and a very briny, perfectly cooked linguini with pancetta, hot pepper, and a generous clam medley. All wonderful. We shared two desserts, a special crostata with marscapone cream and a first class lemon torte. Leisurely paced, yet designed to get us out the door and theatre bound by 630. We look forward to a return visit in the near future.",0,0,0,Steve C.,"Montclair, NJ",1,43,25
3.0,3/8/2019,"I came here for a business lunch in the middle of the week and had a fine experience, the food was hit and miss, but the service was very attentive.The olives that were given to us with the bread was a nice start to the meal.  My dining partner and I opted to get the lunch tasting menu and to add the 3 crudo tasting to it.  I think this was a nice way to be able to sample the items on the menu.The crudo tasting while good was drenched in too much olive oil for my liking that it overpowered the flavor of the fish.I ordered the fish liver appetizer to start and it was quite tasty though I think I prefer foie gras type rather than fish liver.  My dining companions salad looked very fresh. For my main I ordered a grilled fish, I believe it was branzino, which they fileted for us.  I found the fish to be a little lacking in flavor and unevenly cooked, some parts were definitely a little raw.The coffee with gingerbread dessert was good if you like espresso, which they pour into a cup over the gelato for you.Overall, I think this is a fine option for a business lunch in the area, but I probably won't be back.",1,1,1,Elyka A.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",198,204,634
1.0,2/28/2019,"Let's face it there aren't many good restaurants in and around Hell's Kitchen but in a sea of less than stellar offerings and mediocrity Esca  stands out as the worst. It really is. The host's are very nice (even on the phone) and are probably the only redeeming feature of Esca. The restaurant is simply decorated and while not a beautiful restaurant the best part of the dining room is that it is possible to get a table not on top of other diners - just don't choose the banquette's against the wall.Almost as bad as Esca's food was the waiter - now I eat out two or three meals a day so I know waiters and most tend to be honest, hardworking and understand their job is to enhance the dining experience. Not at Esca. Nope not here. Our waiter was pushy (the restaurant was empty) and was basically a pest and an annoyance. Even before our appetizers arrived he asked what we wanted for our main course. Who does that? He asked if we would like more wine when we just started to drink from the wine bottle he brought over. His recommendations were all the highest priced items on the limited menu. We ordered bottled water and before we had one glass he asked if we wanted another bottle. Wow, was this guy annoying. The problem could be a managerial hiring issue because the chef's cooking was as inferior as the waiter's service. Everything was lousy at Esca but the pastas were hitting an all time low. The stand out was the Maccherioni Alla  Chitarra (meaning crappy rotten fish pasta in Esca translation) and it had to be one of the worst pasta dishes we have ever tried. We were unable and unwilling to eat this and the other pasta - they were that bad. We were wise enough not to try dessert and cut our loses and saved our stomachs by leaving this awful restaurant.",0,0,0,Ricky D.,"New York, NY",34,131,0
5.0,2/26/2019,My first time here and I really enjoyed it. The lunch menu is robust and they move along the lunch at a good pace but not to fast. It is perfect for work meetings.

1.0,2/8/2019,"I rarely write a review but I was appalled last night when I went for dinner with two friends for what we hoped would be a lovely pre-theater dinner. The food that arrived was inedible, not even disappointing but palatable, completely inedible. While we were offered only one replacement meal, we were still charged for all three.

1.0,2/8/2019,"Food was salty. The service? Saltier. Our sommelier was actually great, engaging. Not sure what happened but between the appetizer and the main entree, it took around an hour to bring out (I see from previous reviews that this is a common problem). And get this: their payment systems melted down or something, and they said they can't get to our check, so can we wait? I said okay. Then an eternity passes. I tell them I have kids at home and I need to get there before the Social Services descend. One of the manager types comes out and says write down your card number and we'll bill your card and email you confirmation. I say, okay, there's a problem - you didn't itemize or total out what we had, and you want me to leave my card - carte blanche - so you can charge me whatever? To her credit, she whispers a tiny mea culpa, acknowledges it's a bit dumb to ask a customer to leave a card number without the actual total. Oh, that inconvenient but inevitable gravity of logic! The staff huddles some more, another eon passes. I'm about to bust out my iPhone calculator to sum out 1st grade math for them, but by the miracle of God and modernity, the systems come alive. They give us the full check. No apologies. The evening is ruined.Esca management - you should be ashamed of yourselves. My wife and I had a lovely dinner when we first visited a few years back for our anniversay. Clearly something has gone south.

Waitress was over quickly and off we went to a wonderful dining experience. Started with the grilled squid (done perfectly) and the Mozzarella di bufala, that was flavor treat with the dates and almonds. We went pasta for the entree's and were so happy we did, my wife had the one pound lobster with home made spaghetti and I had the guitar string pasta with sea urchin (one of the best dishes I've ever had).

2.0,1/26/2019,"Food is always extremely good if not great and that is why they have any stars. My wife and I recently had dinner and being in the Theatre District, our waitress appropriately asked if we had any time restraints to which we replied yes, as we were going to a show afterwards (Hour and a half for dinner).Our waitress told us no worries, and we proceeded to order some crudo, and appetizer and our entrees. When we did, she asked if we would prefer it served in 2 or 3 courses and we said 2 was fine so that we would not be stressed for time.Everything wound up coming in 3 courses and we were told that per the chef, it was fine with the time.After an hour and fifteen minutes, we started to worry as we had not received our entrees and asked our waitress if we were ok to which she firmly asserted yes. 10 minutes later, and no food yet, we again asked and were told what we would like to do, and that she could box everything up, cancel the order, or wait another 5 minutes, even though we told her multiple times that we were there to go to a show and our time restraints. Well, the food showed up literally 1 minute before we had to leave, so we scarfed it down and when we got the bill, they decided to charge us for everything, and comp us a ""biscotti plate"" which showed up as we were walking out and consisted of 5 or 6 tiny pieces of biscotti. Oh, and did I mention that there was never any apology?I have been here multiple times and always had a great experience which is why we came back, but after this experience, we will never return, nor recommend it to anyone. You can serve the greatest food in the world, but if your service is bad, and in this case, atrocious, good luck getting return customers.

4.0,1/11/2019,Always wanted to eat there..finally did. Worth every bite. Had the Lobster Spaghetti which was amazing but the take away from that dish is the hint of mint.

2.0,12/22/2018,"The food was fine but the service had so much room for improvement.  We were having a pre-theater birthday lunch.  We informed our waiter we had a 2pm curtain when we were seated.  There were only five tables with customers.  We were the second table to be fully seated.  We could not get anyone to take our order for a half an hour.  At one pointed we asked the bus boy to tell our waiter we were ready to order but before the waiter came to our table another table called him over and he went there.  We then called the bus boy over again and finally the bar tender came to take our order.  Our entrees were served  an hour and 15 minutes after we first sat down (45 min before curtain ).  We mentioned several times that we had a theater tickets, at one point the waiter said so did everyone else.  It was very obvious that we were upset with our service and yet we received no apology.  What  should have been a happy occasion became a stressful meal",1,0,0,Sally S.,"New York, NY",0,11,0

The waitress highly recommended a crabcake egg app which ended up being overpriced runny omelette might I add this was dinner time and she recommended we order 2 for a party of 6. They crudo was over salted and not edible. They sat us at a table where their wine wall was and kept asking a 9 month pregnant girl to get up so they can get wine. This was occurring every 10 minutes. When I complained to the manger Nico his response was what do you expect me not to sell wine. Overall awful overpriced experience.

1.0,12/6/2018,"I started with the Uovo Di PolloSoft yet I didn't detect any truffle, the ""lump"" crab were about 4 almond size pieces. I stated at the onset that I do not like chili or pepper yet this plate arrived sprinkled in pepper. I should have took the picture before picking out the crab but at the time, I wasn't expecting to write a review and thus, did not need pictures.My entree was Fettucini Zafferano . My pasta did NOT taste house made. It was bland, over cooked, chewy & starchy. The lobster was overcooked so you know what that implies for texture.My wife started with the Moscardino Grilled Baby Octopus. She felt it was average. Her exact words were, I've enjoyed better at restaurants in the Portuguese area of Newark (NJ). Her office is in Newark so her company often hosts meetings at area restaurants.Her entree was the Spaghetti With Lobster. This she said was ok but still, she did not eat much.That brings me to the server, Lisa K, she was defensive and argumentative. She initially described the Fettucini Zafferano as having chili. When I advised her that I do not like chili, she stated that there was nothing she could do. I had to ask specific questions to learn the sauce is pre-made in the am. She could have offered a sample, given it was already made so I could comfortably order this entree. In my dining experience, sauces that don't require a reason for being pre-made, usually aren't. A fennel sauce does not need or require being pre-made. A lazy chef is why you'd do that.That being said, I ordered it anyway and to my delight, was not spicy although that delight was soon giving way to disappointment at the chewy overcooked lobster and store bought pasta.Both of my dishes & my wifes main entree went back to the kitchen with 3/4 of the ""food"" yet no one from the restaurant came over to inquire.I left a 17% tip, my mistake as I intended to leave 15% but my rumbling stomach interfered with my math skill. The sommelier should have gotten it all.I sent the restaurant a message inviting them to contact me for clarification and an expansion of our experience.

The restaurant had procured some Alba white truffles which were an INCREDIBLE compliment to the tuna carpaccio.Next was the cornmeal crusted blowfish tails. Excellent and uniquely flavorful fish.Then the conchigli pasta dish, initially seemed a bit bland but the key to this dish we discovered his to really mixed everything up, then wow what an amazing difference and outstanding flavor combination. My only complaint with this dish was the fact that they were many tiny clam shells. So you would take a delicious bite and that wonderful flavorful experience was interrupted by the crunch of shell which unfortunately happened about three times with this dish as the shells were hidden in the kale.We had a Newfoundland fish afterwards which I'm sure was good but after several incredibly unique dishes just tasted kind of boring and a bit over smoked.Service was very good from all of the staff from the hostess to the bus people Highly recommended",0,0,0,P C.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,67,154

I'd say presentation was about the only good thing about the meal.Someone in our party ordered the mafalde pasta and said it was a little salty. She didn't want to make a big deal about it. I tasted a little and it was borderline inedible. It tasted like the chef had let the salted pot of water reduce down to become super concentrated when he or she added the noodles. We brought it to the attention of our waiter and instead of making it right, he was very defensive and argued with us, saying he'd never had a complaint about the dish.

Not really fitting for the atomospher but the volume was low enough where it wasn't distracting.",0,0,0,Eric S.,"Austin, TX",970,49,8
4.0,8/1/2018,"We arrived on a beautiful Tuesday evening in July and luckily they had tables outside and we had the opportunity to sit out and enjoy the weather while eating dinner. Sitting outside was romantic, relaxing and peaceful. My gf's and I really enjoyed our evening. Overall the staff was pleasant and attentive. Joe, our waiter was respectful and very knowledgeable of the menu. Nico, the Somm was awesome, he knew the wine menu exceptionally well and was happy to give some excellent wine and entree pairings.Immediately upon seating they gave us some delicious olives marinated in olive oil and some bruschetta with pimento beans, courtesy of the chef. After that it was a bit of a search mission to find the bread guy, but he finally came over with two options of whole wheat bread or white bread. The bread was sadly lackluster. I wish they would have warmed it up. It seemed like it had been out for hours, but I'm not about to judge an entire restaurant on its bread...(just needed to complain a bit here). We split a nice bottle of white wine between the three of us (bottles range from $50 to over $400), and asked for a mixed crudo dish to start. The crudo was excellent! I highly recommend this dish (it's something they are known for). After the crudo we did a pasta dish and a secondi to split three ways. For pasta we had the spaghetti with lobster meat, chilis and mint. We were all very pleased with this dish. It wasn't too heavy and the pasta was cooked just right (al Dente is the only way to cook pasta!) For the secondi, we split the pollo between us. I wish they had split this dish up the way they split the pasta dish up, but that's okay. (A bit of a struggle trying to split this). Anyway, the chicken was roasted and had a delicious skin on it. I never had lemons cooked in an oven like they did, it was interesting! For dinner they left us with some biscotti and brought over some dessert wine courtesy of the chef. The wine was so sweet! I don't believe any of us were super hungry when we arrived so we found these three dishes to be enough food. If however, you come super hungry, you may want to order more food. Not my favorite Bastianich restaurant (then again there are so many) but I was pleased when we left.",3,1,3,Shannon W.,"Paramus, NJ",592,501,940

One waiter disappeared for a good 25 minutes, no one came to check on us or to see if we wanted another bottle of wine, the music was just slightly too loud cheesy eighties karaoke, and although it wasn't busy there on a Monday night, we felt a bit neglected and in the end underwhelmed with our experience, in spite of the superb crudo.

Nothing we ate tonight tasted special, except for the crostini that is offered to each table by the chef at the start of the meal. The stuffed zucchini flowers antipasti tasted like fried anything, nothing distinct about them. The baked vongole appetizer had barely a bite of of the cherry peppers or spicy Calabrian sausage and no distinct flavor. The spaghetti neri wasn't as spicy as the server said it would be and tasted almost exactly like the fettuccine that my husband ordered. Again, nothing distinct or flavorful as it should be for the price we paid. And, my $18 glass of wine was warm, sent it back, and it came back just as warm.

Our waiter asked if we were seeing a show and said he would be sure we would be out on time, which we were.The menu mainly focused on lovely appetizers, pasta and fish.  My appetizer was the daily special of buffalata, tomatoes with greens; it was very fresh and flavorful.  For dinner, I ordered a delicious thin spaghetti with rock shrimp in a light oil and herb sauce.  I finished the entire bowl which I normally don't do - it was really good.  My friends had another pasta dish served with clams in a spicy sauce.  They also enjoyed it.There were several other things on the menu - especially some of the interesting and different fish dishes -  that I would like to have tried so I will remember this place the next time we are in NYC for a show to try out other options.Definitely recommend this pre-theater dinner.",0,0,0,Barbara D.,"New Windsor, NY",2,28,10

5.0,5/24/2018,"Enjoyed my pretheater experience here. Yes the tables are close together, however we were lucky to be seated in the booth by the door. I enjoyed my experience! Did the whole 9yards dining. The bread service is impecable. The server assistants were very on top of making sure guests were taken care of. Ensuring we never sat with dirty plates for too long, making sure we got bread if we wanted more. Started off with a nice glass of a Chardonnay, sauvignon blanc blend, oysters of course. Had half and half, west coast and east coast. What made it amazing was the  fresh horseradish that  gets shaved on top of  the oysters. I wish I had more of it, but I didn't  want the poor server to stand there forever. The minonette was very vinegar-y for my taste. But simple lemon and chili oil did the trick for me and my oysters.Second course, had the tuna caroaccio, love carpaccio! Never seen tuna carpaccio the way this was set up but it was wonderful. Had a very soft geletin feel to it with the crisp crunch of the sea salt made it amazing. Also had the fritti which is like a seafood fried mix. There were spring onions, monkfish and other seafood items fried with it that made it so good. The sauce that was drizzled at the bottom had a certain tang and citrus acidity to it which went so well with the perfect batter and perfect crisp.Then as an entree, had the bronzino. I have had bronzino before. However not presented like this. Presented to the table first with an entire salt crust hardened all over it. Once we played the bronzino presentation, the server assistant brought the fish to the side to crack it open AND FILET IT! We were presented with beautiful fileted bronzino which had amazing texture and flavor to it. We had fingerling sides and roasted peppers to enjoy with it.I enjoyed the affogato dessert which was served with mascarpone gelato topped off with espresso with ladyfingers on the side. Loved it. Beautiful presentation but I would do without the plastic straw for presentation sake. Served with complimentary biscotti at the end which honestly is assorted cookies and could be a dessert in itself.The food is beautiful and equally wonderful. The service was very impressive. Our server know how to sell to us, she knew what were the specials, and exactly what was in it. The staff is on point. As I would expect being as fine dining as this was.

2.0,4/15/2018,"Had a 8pm reservation. Sat us (2) people at the worst possible table right across from bar in the corner, and we were expecting a 3rd person to sit where the staff went back and forth. Clearly not a table for 3. We asked the waitress for a recommendation for a cocktail. Tasted like orange kool aid. Had to send it back. Settled for wine. The room was very dark, and extremely noisy. Could barely have a conversation between all the other tables and the music. I guess people love shouting to have a conversation. Lower the music please? We ordered the soft shell crab as an appetizer. The waitress stated they were already out of them. Can u imagine? 8pm reservation, and its Saturday. Seriously??Food was favorably prepared, clam appetizer was excellent, and sea scallops were perfect. When our check came, we asked for change. The waitress said it would be hard to give. What planet is she working on? She said bar had none, and I guess the main register didn't either. I said I'll give a credit card then. No choice. Well, she did come back with the change. She must have  ran to the closest ATM machine. Bottom line: pricey, service is mediocre, and the waitress acted like we were bothering her. Get another job, please, if you can't handle being in the public sector. Recommendation: When making a reservation, if u dare, demand to sit in the main dining room....thats if they will let you.

2.0,12/22/2017,"I have been to Esca many times over the years. It is usually very good, but I have had some mixed experiences there too. Tonight was one of those.         Had the porcini mushroom appetizer to start. It came with a generous portion of porcinis prepared two ways. Some of the porcinis were incredibly bitter. Mentioned this to the server only after we had eaten them, he suggested that it was because of what part of the garden they were from. I have had porcini mushrooms a hundred times or so. These were the most bitter ones I have ever had. I now suspect that there were tylopilus mushrooms (aka false porcini) mixed in, as I read can sometimes be the case with porcinis, especially ones from China and also possibly ones from other places. They left a bitter taste in the mouth for quite some time.        My main course the monkfish had three smallish morsels of monkfish, the portion was surprisingly small. And it was not cooked properly, it had a bad mealy texture, and dried out. The main courses took a long time to come. Maybe it was under a heat lamp for too long? A pathetic dish for $43. The pastas my dining companions had were not so great, a little off from the usual good flavors, a little over cooked perhaps, and a pathetic amount of seafood in the seafood pasta.          Oh the fusilli seafood pasta. The pasta it came with was a long dual-tube shaped pasta. Mentioned to the waiter a bit late that this was not fusilli, not looking to return it but just curious. Oddly he insisted is was fusilli. It just didn't look similar to fusilli, which is more of a corkscrew thing, yeah? Not important, but a bit weird to be told no that is fusilli. Umm no it is not?          A lot of the fish they prepare at Esca are the cheaper fish that one can buy at the store. Monkfish, skate wing, farm raised salmon, etc. There are not a lot of wild and premium type fishes on the menu. But the preparations can be outstanding.  This is Times Square, so if you want great food it can cost extra.  $43 for a tiny amount of overcooked monkfish is getting a bit ridiculous though. Might still be back anyway. The times square area is not exactly filled with great restaurants. Sometimes Esca is a great restaurant. But not going to be in any rush.         Esca, please check your porcini mushrooms, to see if they have tylopilus mixed in. I strongly suspect they do! Most of them were so bitter!

I told him yes, fully expecting that we would have plenty of time for a pleasant meal. WRONG. As we waited nearly an hour (55 min to be exact) for our appetizers to be served, we watched adjacent tables eat multiple courses. The mains took until 7pm to arrive. We felt rushed and ignored. Our server was largely absentee. He also took forever to have the glass of wine my husband ordered sent to our table, so he didn't even really have time for a second glass. It was also my husband's 50th birthday so we briefly wondered if we should even try for dessert. I told our server we had to leave in 15 minutes so what did he recommend. He said no problem, and then our dessert didn't arrive until we pretty much had to leave. What should have been a great meal was marred by terrible service. We ended up running to the theatre and making it with two minutes to spare. FOOD IS JUST OKAY. We liked the bluefin pastrami, the pulipo, and tuna prosciutto appetizers. The lobster spaghetti was tasty but not spectacular. The frito misto would have been better as a smaller app but a waste as an entree. The broccoli side was overdone and mushy. The dessert we got was slapped together and altogether unremarkable. AMBIANCE STINKS. The tables are pretty close together, to the point where the table had to be shifted anytime we had to get in or out. The music is your karaoke favorites from the '70s and '80s. Overall, it's very noisy and I had to ask my husband to repeat what he was saying many times. DON'T GO. YOU'LL REGRET IT.

2.0,10/24/2017,"We made a reservation 3 weeks in advance for my mother's birthday dinner on 10/6. When my mother expressed an interest in the tasting menu, I called the restaurant to see what, if anything, could be done for the one person in our party who is vegan--as full table participation is required for the tasting menu. I wasn't expecting to hear anything but ""the best option is for everyone to order a la carte,"" especially since Esca is so focused on seafood. I was pleasantly surprised and impressed when I was transferred to someone who said that they could make adjustments to the tasting menu so that the vegan would have a similar experience as the rest of the table, except with vegan-friendly ingredients. A minute later, I thought to myself, ""Why of course, it's a Mario Batali restaurant--why would I expect anything less?""Two nights before the dinner, Esca called to confirm the reservation. I again mentioned the vegan tasting menu request and they made a note in our reservation. She said to inform the waiter of the request during dinner. Easy peasy.Fast forward to dinner. Our reservation was at 8:00pm. The night started out rocky. After being seated, my entire family decided to use the rest room at the same time, so I was left sitting at the empty table. I probably sat there for 5 minutes before anyone noticed me and offered a menu or water. The restaurant was a beehive of activity, so I chalked it up to oversight. However, things took a turn when we told the waiter we were going with the tasting menu and that I'd do the vegan option. I mentioned that I'd called in advance. The waiter looked confused and went off to check with someone. He later came back and informed me that the chef couldn't do a vegan tasting menu after all and suggested we do a la carte. I asked if the 4 of them could do the tasting and I pick something from the a la carte. No.My mother was very much looking forward to the tasting menu and it was too late to go elsewhere, so I went with the regular tasting menu as well. I normally would have requested to speak to a manager and ask why they could not accommodate my request, which I had made 3 weeks prior, but was not in the mood to fight that night. I really shouldn't have had to fight, anyway. The food got above average reviews from my family (Marea is much better, they reported), but the whole experience was extremely disappointing and subpar for a restaurant with the Batali/Bastianich name.

Not a lick of privacy and squeezing into my spot meant my back side was all in my neighbors water glass...and I am not overweight. The WORST part of the evening was being made to feel like I was some con artist trying to get freebies because I wanted a taste between two wines before choosing. Didn't know if I wanted the Rose or the Sav Blanc and they would not let me taste between types. Really? I only asked once- wasn't like I asked for 10 tastes. I got the most condescending look from the sommelier. It made me feel so ashamed for asking and out of place to be there at all. So- I had no wine whatsoever and we downsized our food order. The ""guitar shaped"" pasta was chewy and stuck to my teeth. Seriously the worst pasta texture I've EVER had in my mouth. I don't know where the supposed sea urchin was. Neither of us saw anything resembling anything but a smooth sauce and we were really looking forward to seeing and tasting something new. My boyfriend's mixed seafood pasta dish was fishy and the sauce was a yawn. I didn't eat much of my dinner and no one said a word when I didn't ask to wrap it up.

We came straight from the airport, and planned on eating lunch (sharing, just so we can try some nice food but not have a full meal). The waiter that came to our table was weird from the beginning, very snobby from the moment we said we were just drinking water. We ordered the raw fish tasting plate for our appetizer ($30) to split. The waiter kept insisting on us EACH getting one?? We kept saying no and soon found out that one was definitely plenty for the both of us. Then we said we wanted to split the sea bass and he said there was a minimum for the table (I thought this was only a thing for large groups??). Anyway he said we should get this other fish instead which we saw was only $4 more. And I even said this, but we ordered what he told us to. Turns out they charged us double to split a REALLY small fish. Apparently ""PP"" was on the menu which means per person, but he knew we did not know this because we said ""Only four dollars more? Okay i guess?"". We were totally tricked. He got one over on a young couple trying to live it up a little.  After that, we did not feel welcome at all. Maybe we're used to southern hospitality. I've never been to a restaurant where I felt so unwelcome. We actually had a friend show up when we were done with our meal, because he had just arrived from the airport as well. He came in around the courtyard instead of through the main entrance and the snobby waiter guy got onto him...? Like lectured another adult. Even though our friend ended up in the right place, it seemed like he wanted him to actually walk around again and do it right. It very much seems like they're going for a certain ""look"" and are willing to be rude to anyone that doesn't fit their standards so maybe we won't come back. It worked. Foodwise: the raw tasting plate was good. You can definitely share this with another person. The turbot.....i did not understand. It was fresh, but no flavor. I have paid a lot for some fantastic meals in my life, but I guess I just didn't understand this? Maybe the jerk waiter just put a bad taste in our mouth.

1.0,6/26/2017,"Wow. What a disappointment. After enjoying a couple of business lunches at ESCA over the years, I decided to entrust them to be the perfect pre-theater destination on my husband's birthday, earlier this month. The theater district is basically a culinary deadzone; but I trusted the Bastianich/Batali influence at ESCA would provide a welcoming, delicious experience. Over the years, my husband and I have dined at remarkable establishments. including Michelin-starred Blanca and Brooklyn Table, and VISTA in the Algarve of Portugal. I realize we are not celebrities and by ESCA's mid-Manhattan standards, a couple of nobodys, but we are nobodys that understand good food and good service.  And, truth be told, on your birthday, everyone should be made to feel like a somebody.I booked a 5pm reservation for a 7pm curtain. When we arrived, the waitress asked us what time we absolutely needed to be out the door. We all agreed on 640pm. We first asked if we could place our crudo order while we reviewed the rest of the menu. They told us 'no', everything must be ordered at once. Fine. We placed our entire order. By now, it was 5:30pm.  30 minutes wasted bringing our drinks and being told how we can order.At 5:50pm, we finally received our crudo.  20 minutes.  For Crudo.  We began to look at each other nervously. I ask the waitress if they could bring all our plates as they become available(instead of by-course) and again am told 'no', that's not how they do things here.  I am also told, patronizingly, 'don't worry dear, we'll have you out the door on time for your show'.I glance at the table next to us, who have salads, mains and dessert all on the table at once. From this I can only surmise the service you receive is based on the server you're assigned - which should not be the case!  At 6:10pm we received our starters - the monkfish liver and octopus.  These were delicious. I can't fault the food; well, the food we actually did receive.    By 6:20pm they had cleared our starter plates. Again, sitting anxiously, I look around to try and find our server.By 6:27pm, with no signs of our main courses in sight, I walk up to our server and request our bill for the wine and courses we have had. I explain to her that we are not prepared to wolf down our plates of pasta to then run out of here to make our show.  She barely makes eye contact with me, doesn't apologize, and then has the supposed manager bring the bill over to us.  So shameful. The manager brings the bill and says, 'we didn't charge you for your main courses', as if he was doing us some sort of favor. I say, 'well we didn't receive them, so I would not expect to pay for them'. I pay for what we had consumed and ask him, 'shouldn't 90 minutes be enough time for a pre-theater meal'?  He says, begrudgingly, 'yes'. I express how disappointed we are, my husband's birthday, etc., etc. He offers his card and for us to 'come back any time'. I tell him they've already nearly ruined one evening, I'm not about to let myself or my husband fall victim to them again.  Bill paid, off we ran to the theater, with me apologizing to my husband that he didn't get to eat a birthday dinner on his birthday.ESCA has lost the plot -  it is a far cry from fine dining.",5,0,0,Tracy S.,"Bronx, NY",46,154,3

1.0,5/2/2017,"I've been to Esca a number of times and generally like the food, but after tonight's experience, I'm not so sure about whether the service matches the food or the type of restaurant that Esca wants to be.A friend was visiting from out of town, so the 5 of us were really excited to have a chance to catch up over good food. Well, that mood soured quickly...After we got seated, our server asked us several times whether we were sure we didn't want wine, to which we said no -- standard fare for NYC restaurants (though I really wish places would just accept ""no, I don't want wine"" the first time around). When it came time to order, though, I placed an order for one pasta dish and no appetizer. At which point, he goes, ""You know, we have a minimum here."" Ok, fine. A lots of restaurants have minimums for groups, but they are typically printed on the menus or stated *somewhere* as your'e making the reservation. So we were surprised, but asked for the dollar minimum so that we could order appropriately. The response we got: ""Well, it's not a dollar minimum, but for tables of um...6...you need 1-2 appetizers for the table."" WHAT?? What kind of bs policy is that? At this point, you can probably imagine the likelihood that we're going to entertain the thought of ordering an appetizer, just based on principle. We asked if we could just have entrees, since we weren't *that* hungry, at which point he leaves to ""check"" with the manager.Even though we were ""allowed"" to ""just"" order entrees in the end, it did put a damper on our reunion dinner just a bit. Luckily, the remainder of the staff made up for this horrible experience.

3.0,5/2/2017,"My father and I went to Esca last night before an 8 pm show at a theatre nearby. While the food was excellent, I was very disappointed that we were forced into ordering more than we had wanted/intended.We were there early compared to our usual preferred dinner hour, so we each just wanted to have a cocktail and order 2 appetizers that we could both share. After receiving our cocktails, bread, olives, and complimentary bruschetta, we ordered our two desired appetizers and were told there was a minimum. We had to order at least 4 appetizers, or 2 appetizers and one entrée. Neither of these options were appealing to us.We wound up ordering 4 appetizers. I was extremely put off by having to do this, as neither my father nor I are big eaters, and had a very hard time finishing the dishes, but we felt like we had to for their high price tags. I left with a stomachache that persisted throughout the evening and overnight, and only felt better this morning.While the food was delicious, I did not find the staff to be very accommodating to our wishes (and the restaurant had plenty of seats empty at that time, so there was really no need to force patrons into ordering in a manner they hadn't initially intended!) I was also frustrated that we were not told about the minimum until we had settled in and received drinks/snacks.

3.0,4/7/2017,"This restaurant has the potential to be 5 stars, however, given the prices on the menu and the service, I cannot honestly give a 4-5 star rating. We ordered appetizers to share and clearly specified that when we ordered . My husband ordered the appetizers and deferred to me to order my main course. Upon doing so, the waiter asked what I wanted to start, I clarified that we would share the appetizers. My husband then ordered his entree. We were given olives and crostini with bean topping to start, which were good and different from the typical bread and butter.  The table wasn't big enough to accommodate more than a plate in the middle and individual appetizer sized plates. Knowing this and that we were to share our appetizers the wait staff should have put our orders into the kitchen in a way where we would not have an overcrowded table. This was not the case; both the oysters (6) and the razor clam crudo came out at the same time which resulted in an oversized trough of a plate of  oysters to be presented in front of my husband and the razor clams in the middle of the table.  We were asked if we wanted horseradish for the oysters; we said yes, but never received it. The oysters were good and priced comparably to other restaurants we have been to. They were cleaned well and chilled appropriately. I can't compare the razor clam crudo to anything as we've never ate that before, but it was good. However, we were only given 3 pieces for $22; compared to the price of oysters this is expensive.The issue comes in with the main course; I ordered the squid ink pasta ($25), which again is somewhat reasonable, however the portion was small and there was little consistency other than the pasta itself with a garlic chili oil based sauce. My husband ordered the fried fish which was priced at $35 where the waiter explained would be monkfish, calamari and shrimp. When it arrived, it looked like a $15 shareable appetizer at a chain restaurant. The wine and appetizers were great and priced comparably to portion and other restaurants we have been to.

I appreciated the non-alcoholic house made sodas, as I was not drinking. Part of our table started the meal with some crudo which they very much enjoyed. We chose to do three courses, appetizers, pasta course and entrees but we shared all of these. Highlights: Definitely get the stuffed clams, we were practically fighting over them. The grilled calamari would also be one we would get again if we returned.The fritti was nice with onions, clams and halibut cheeks, good for sharing. the server suggested the chitarra with crab and uni and we were glad we got it. Best out of the three pasta we tried. We typically don't get contori but the broccoli and potatoes were both stand out as far as vegetables go. We also enjoyed the linguine with clams. We had three desserts but the citrus zabaglione was the winner by far. I personally was a little disappointed with the butterfish and the bavette. Neither one were flavorful enough for me. The flounder tasted great but having seen the fish both on and off the bone, we felt a little cheated and would have ordered more food had we known.Would I rush back to Esca? Probably not. Would I go again if someone asked me? Sure. The positives far out weighed the negatives but there are so many places to try.

I don't know - it was really delicious, we had 3 or 4 of them throughout the night.

Then we had to wait at least 40 minutes, possibly longer, to receive our entrees. At this point it was 7:20pm and we were getting anxious about making it to the show. We scarfed down our entrees and sadly told the waitress that we didn't have time for dessert before quickly paying and rushing out. We expressed our frustration at the delays in the meal, but the staff at Esca did very little to make it up to us. The waitress gave a qualified apology with a lame excuse, but didn't offer to take any food off the bill, so we left a small tip. Considering how expensive the meal was, this poor service was really disappointing. I suspect they got too comfortable since we left plenty of time before our show, and they didn't give us the same treatment that theater-goers with a 6pm reservation would have received. This is pathetic though since as a pre-theater restaurant, they should have this down to a science by now. I've been to Esca before and enjoyed it, but after this last experience, I won't be back.",1,0,0,Lee A.,"Manhattan, NY",223,71,27

1.0,12/6/2015,"I brought my parents here for a nice meal on a Sunday night before they were going back home. We were expecting a good meal and atmosphere however it ended their trip and my Sunday night on a terrible note. We were seated in a room with a table of 6 young guys who were obviously spending a lot of money on alcohol and food on their corporate card. They were so loud and obnoxious it ruined our meal and we were not the only ones. The table next to us asked to be moved to another room. Not only were they extremely loud and inconsiderate it was completely inappropriate in an establishment like this. They were talking about strip clubs, every other word was f*ck and they were screaming at a table of two older ""desperate housewives"" and asking them if they would have sex with them. One guy was motioning with his tongue and fingers to the ladies. I was mortified and with my parents and was appalled that the restaurant staff did nothing. Until the other table moved and we complained multiple times they did not do anything to calm the situation down and asked us instead if they could get us an after dinner drink. Not once did they go to the table to ask them to be more respectful. Honestly, it felt like we were in a frat house or rowdy bar, not a nice establishment. I am absolutely furious, upset and sad that they ruined the last night I had with my parents. I frequent their restaurants often, but will now think twice about it and will definitely not be back to Esca. It's unfortunate because the food is delicious and I live in the neighborhood.",0,0,0,Gina G.,"New York, NY",103,6,0
5.0,12/4/2015,Had an excellent dinner from start to finish.  Octopus appetizer was perfect.  We then had the Branzino for two.  I would say the only disappointment of the Branzino was that they brought it table side but took it away to plate it.  Service was good although the managers circling the room every 2 minutes was a bit over the top.,1,0,0,Mike C.,"Glenside, PA",56,132,16

1.0,10/11/2015,"Worst dining experience ever! Synopsis: Manager told me if I didn't like the dish then go into the kitchen and make it myself. How it unfolded: My snapper fillet was served with bones and a burnt skin. I took the skin off but the burnt taste had permeated the meat of the fish, leaving such an unpleasant taste in my mouth I had to pop a mint. When I told the waiter he seemed not to care, so I asked to see the manager. A person in a suit (manager?) informed me the fish was charred, not burnt, and proceeded to ARGUE his point. Whatever they chose to call it, it was unsatisfactory. The meal was $300 for 2, so obviously I expect better service, I do not expect to be insulted. As an aside we just returned from Europe where we had 2 dinners in 3-Michelin star restaurants, so we are knowledgeable diners - that said, no one should be exposed to the crass, wanton behavior we experienced with the Esca staff.

Tasteless and rubbery.Fried anchovy fries were decent, but served cold not hot.Whole Orata porgy was over cooked, dry, and flat in flavor.  Lemon squeezed upon was the only zest to the dry fish. Skin not crisp, couldn't eat.House made pasta with uni and crab was gross, it was served cold, which means it sat in kitchen awhile before it arrived to our table!!! Crab was minuscule and tiny flakes were hard to find and uni was evident only in the color of the sauce which seemed like the uni was not fresh and a very low grade. I basically picked the crab out and ate the scallions on top but could not eat  cold pasta.  The kale side dish was so over cooked it looked black and we each took one bite and left the rest to dispose to the trash, which it was.  Again no flavor overcooked by days, and disappointing.  Prosecco  Sabayon was served on a warm plate with a few berries, and was eggy tasting as serving sabayon warm is a turn off as i didn't order scrambled eggs!   We drank a lovely burgundy and the evening highlight was the wine.  Major disappointment on so many levels.  I would not go here nor recommend.  New York has too many great places to eat!  This one not even close!  Do not waste your money!  This place is expensive garbage.",2,1,0,Chef Earth E.,"Dublin, Republic of Ireland",11,341,455

He came to our table and chatted us up for a bit. He was a really nice guy. My father-in-law was over the moon. That was such an incredibly nice thing. Let me start by saying, this place is incredibly expensive. Like insanely expensive. For the amount of money we spent, I expected incredible food. And while the food was good, it was not worth the prices being charged. The wine was marked up to such a degree I was flabbergasted when I opened the menu. My family and I ordered the Burratta appetizer. It had Burratta, fried artichokes, and arugula on top. That cost $20. Insane. It was delicious and probably my favorite part of the meal, but that is just too much money for that. I am a vegetarian so I ordered the gnocchi. My husband does not like seafood so he ordered the chicken. The rest of my family ordered seafood entrees. My gnocchi was very good. All the pasta in each dish was homemade. The sauce was a bit lacking in flavor. My husband throughly enjoyed his chicken. The rest of family liked their dishes but were not totally impressed.

Then he continued to instruct us that we weren't ordering correctly - and then had the audacity to blame us when he was confused by our order. He proceeded to explain why he didn't understand the order and why it was our fault. I think his manager told him he had been inappropriate and that's why they brought us some free cookies to make up for it. I've never been treated so rudely at a restaurant even ones that aren't as expensive as this one.  It's a shame because the food was excellent and some of the other employees were kind.

We opted for the later two.  The pasta was so small, I finished it in 6 bites and any octopus was hard to find.  It was ok, but lackluster.  The shark was wonderful, but the veggie sides were total mush.  Two dessert choices were olive oil cake and a flourless chocolate cake, the latter the size of a small chips ahoy cookie. Both were good, but we would't have ordered either if we had a choice.  If restaurant week is an opportunity to attract new customers, Esca failed.

I took his recco for a bottle of wine which was towards their pricier options and when I tasted the glass I realized it was not as cold as it may need to be but not being a sommelier I thought maybe this white isn't served as cold. When my clients tasted it they immediately said this wine is too warm and we called the sommelier back over. His response was that I tasted it and I should have told him before he poured it. Not sure what difference that would have made since he would have had to open a different bottle anyway and he offered no other solution other than he is chilling the bottle now.  The service was slow and we waited a long time in between appetizers and the restaurant was 79 degrees- I was sitting next to the thermostat.  I'd say there are plenty of other options in NYC than to go to this restaurant where the food and the service are not close to being on the same level.,1,0,0,Windy H.,"Manhattan, NY",0,2,0

1.0,6/22/2015,"I don't write reviews, however in this instance, I just can't help it. Hands down, the worst experience I've ever had at a restaurant. We've dined at some of the nicest restaurants in the World including many places in New York (Daniel's on the upper east side as an example) and I really don't mind the cost associated with such restaurants, spending 400-1000$ for a meal for two. But when the service is this far sub-par, it's outrageous.The only two items I can say positively: 1) we had no reservation - we were seated promptly, 2) The little bit of food we did get to taste was very good.The first compliant, the time wait. We spent a little over a hour at our table. During that time, we had ordered our entire meal -- several appetizers, a bottle of wine, and our entrees. It took nearly a hour for the first appetizer to come out to our table, the first 3 of 6 small pieces of fish (which again, to be fair, were prepared very good).The second compliant, I spoke with the waiter about the service and wait time. Offering feedback to our dissatisfaction, that other patrons had been served multiple courses in the time we'd been waiting. He offered us an apology and seemed to be willing to make the situation correct by increasing the frequency in which our food was to be delivered. (We understand sometimes things happen in restaurants and we're typically very understanding patrons)The third compliant, 25 more minutes went by without any additional food. Or attention from our waiter about the progress of our meals.By this point, we were tired of waiting for our food. I called over our waiter one more time and suggested we'd pay for what we'd consumed and leave. And magically the second half of the first appetizer showed up a minute after I suggested this.At which time I again told the waiter to send it back as we already told him we were done. He suggested the manager come over, and the manager's first words were, ""Are you in a hurry?""My take away here is that if you're looking to come to this restaurant; clearly look forward to spending several hours in sheer anticipation of the promised menu items.Ultimately after the manager insulted us, I politely reaffirmed my disappointment with their service and informed him we were leaving. He then attempted to make us wait an additional 10 minutes to try and figure out what to do; I put down a 100$ bill on the table and we walked out.What a disappointment.",0,0,0,Kyle J.,"Manhattan, NY",0,1,0
1.0,6/21/2015,"We booked a table after the Tony Bennett Lady Gaga  concert last night and were utterly disappointed by the service, attitude and food. The waiter clearly did not want to be there and argued with us about our request not to have any salt added to our dishes. We just like the natural taste of well seasoned food properly prepared. To be fair the Polipo and Crudo of Black Sea Bass were quite good although the Bass was a bit fishy in its aroma. They only had white bread left to serve which was a disappointment and then when the main course of American Red Snapper arrived we were amazed to see it charred to a hard salty crust on top like it had been left too long in the pan and both it and the spinach were so salty they were inedible. We informed our waiter what the situation was and he turned on his heel and said he'd get the manager as if we'd done something wrong or insulting! The manager seemed shocked we were unhappy and asked with an air of incredulity if we wanted the dinners re- made and with the overall lack of care we just decided we'd had enough of the place and declined a remake.

A bit noise but when people have too much alcohol, good experience, and good food they tend to be be a little loud. That us not a problem to me at all.

We booked dinner here before a show for Mother's Day based a little on reviews and a lot on the big names behind the restaurant. Let me tell you, we were NOT disappointed. Our waiter came to introduce himself very shortly after we were seated. His first question was if we had any plans, like a show we were attending, that had us on limited time so he could pace our meal accordingly. How smart! (And why do all restaurants near the theater district do the same?) That set the tone for the rest of the service we received that night. Wine is ordered with a sommelier, all meals are delivered at the same time, all dishes are picked up at the same time, and any crumb that is left gets quickly swept away. The whole restaurant was beautifully decorated and doesn't leave you looking for much more by way of ambiance which nicely rounded out the experience. But the star of the evening was the food. I am drooling as I think about it to write this review. Every meal on the table was beautifully presented and perfectly prepared. Every bite was spiced to perfection and cooked just so. Not one of us left a scrap of our meal behind. I will warn you about price, however. When you look at the menu online, you can quickly see the food is on the high end. This is fine because you truly get what you pay for. What we were not prepared for was that the menu and portions are set up to be multi-course. So just know, going in, you will be ordering several courses.",1,0,1,Nicole D.,"Hightstown, NJ",17,72,85

5.0,5/27/2015,"I never write reviews but I must now. The good part of dining at Esca is the dining; the bad part comes when you realize there isn't a crumb left of your wonderful dinner and leaving this pretty place is what you should do! We dined outside last night, in  amazingly private space,, amazing because it is, after all, right next to the entrance to a rather tall building, but it is so carefully done, you really don't need to know. Now as to the service...our waiter was a fountain of knowledge in a delightful droll way, appreciating our pleasure, making sure we had a leisurely meal even if we did have to dash to the theatre. Next meal at Esca will be minus curtain time, that's for sure. Lingering is what we wanted, savoring every bite just a little longer.We had the shad roe (didn't know it existed in Italy) which was divine, not a word I use easily but It was just perfect, better than any we have ever had, including the many that I cooked at home. The spaghetti neri was almost as good as any in Venice, and that is saying quite a mouthful! Soft shell crab is hard to ruin, but my lovely crunchy outside and melting inside was nevertheless a surprise.I think it would be kind if they gave a bottle of the olive oil the olives come with to every guest, or at least to every guest whose initials are OG!  No other complaints at all!",0,0,0,Olivia G.,"New York, NY",0,2,0

1.0,5/25/2015,This is my third time to esca and my past two visits have been very disappointing. I will not be coming back. We ordered two pasta dishes - the linguini was undercooked to the point of being crunchy and being able to stay straight. The spaghetti was undercooked into a single mushy lump. For an Italian seafood place not being able to cook pasta is unforgivable.

2.0,5/3/2015,"Hugely disappointing. The menu reads beautifully, so many interesting options. The amuse offered from the kitchen was a mackerel toast. Normally a huge fan of mackerel, this managed to be unappetizing- looking and bland. The ceviche came in a puddle of brown, frigid, vinegary liquid, clearly made hours earlier and refrigerated. No remnant of fresh seafood flavor remained, each type of fish only distinguishable by texture. The pasta with sea urchin and crab was so over salted to be almost inedible, completely overcooked and mushy. The calamari appetizer was bland, dry and overcooked. Alternatively, the crudo tasting was great, according to those at the table lucky to have ordered it. No more olive oil cake on the menu even though this was supposed to be one of their great desserts.

3.0,5/1/2015,"I was so excited to check this place out on my first trip to NYC with my husband, but was sadly disappointed at the service.  The food was amazing...that's why I gave it three stars instead of only 1.  We have been to many high end restaurants all over the country, and the service at Esca was terrible.  We visited on a Friday night after catching a Broadway show.  We arrived early so we sat at the bar to have a drink.  The hostess promised she would come get us when our table was ready.  That never happened.  Before we knew it, it was almost 1/2 hour past our reservation time and she never came to get us.  Finally, we tracked her down and it was clear she had forgotten about us.  We were seated in the corner near the back of the restaurant and were told that our bar tab would be transferred to our table instead of letting us close out at the bar, as we requested.  Our dinners were delicious, but we had to track down the waiter (twice) for more wine and it was clear that he had completely dismissed our table.  Another server deposited some food at our table with barely a description of what it was, so we flagged down the manager to find out what we were eating.At a restaurant like this, we always expect that our napkins should be folded when we leave the table to go to the restroom.  I was (again) sadly disappointed that, upon my return, it was crumpled on the table as I had left it. This little gesture costs a restaurant NOTHING...but it goes a long way with us when the staff takes the time to fold it neatly and place it back on the table.All in all, we were very disappointed in Esca.  A few days later we went to Felidia and I would go back there for the food and service a thousand times before coming back here.Oh, and they never did transfer the bar tab to our table which is unfortunate because the bartender gave us the best service at Esca all night.",0,0,0,Kathie Z.,"Spring, TX",0,3,0
4.0,3/16/2015,"This is a restaurant with some deeply good food.  Specifically, the crudo is incredible and anyone going to Esca should try it.  It's really, really good.  The Italian take on sushi is perhaps done better here than anywhere else.  The other seafood dishes I had were also extremely good.  The sardines served in different styles are oily, fishy awesomeness.  I also had some of the whole Branzino and some pasta.  Everything was top notch, and I left very satisfied.  The service was also high quality during my visit.  Waiters were attentive and easily able to discuss the finer points of various seafood products.  Value for the money is so-so, because it is very expensive.  Go in knowing that, obviously.  But you won't be disappointed by the food, especially the crudo and the small fish appetizers.One note - Esca is an extremely loud restaurant in many areas.  The sound acoustics are terrible and it's just very, very loud.  If that bothers you, be aware going in that you might not be able to hear the person across the table from you without almost shouting.",0,0,0,Danny O.,"Manhattan, NY",12,139,0
2.0,3/16/2015,"To be fair, if I was writing a review based on the food alone, I would probably give this place four stars. Yes, the portions are small. Yes, it's expensive (hence the four $$$$ next to the name). Yes, it attracts the theater crowd, which subsequently makes it (a) difficult to get a reservation on certain nights and (b) crowded and a bit loud. The food was decent, although I am basing that opinion only on the two crudo and two pasta dishes that I tried. I prefer other MB restaurants, but I did not think the dishes that I had at Esca were overly salty as other reviewers have stated. Perhaps my taste buds have been stunted by too much sriracha abuse over the years.My frustrations with this place have to do with the disorganization that I experienced overall. We had three separate servers who were simultaneously checking in on our table. At first I thought perhaps one was a sommelier or a runner, but no, they were all servers. This led to confusion, redundant questions/answers, and waves of over-attention followed by waves of utter neglect. It culminated with the fact that we ordered a pricey bottle of wine to share among three people. We each received a small pour and never saw the bottle again. After a few failed attempts at flagging down one of our three servers once we were finished eating, we were finally able to ask about the remainder of the wine, at which point the server apologized and brought it out to us. For a $$$$ restaurant, this was pretty amateur. The following day, I checked my credit card statement, and I had three separate pending charges on my account (perhaps each of the three separate waiters took turns charging me). I had split the bill with my brother and we had tipped in cash, yet his card was never charged, and mine was charged for my portion of the bill, his portion of the bill, and some other party's $200+ bill. Ridiculous. I e-mailed the restaurant and the GM sent me a pretty quick response (clearly in haste, given that it contained multiple typos including ""Generak Manager"" instead of ""General Manager"" in his e-mail signature). Again, that seemed a bit amateur as well. This is a Mario Batali restaurant, not some local Applebee's. In any case, the ""Generak Manager"" did rectify the incorrect charges within a couple of days, which I am grateful for, but I don't plan to revisit this place anytime soon.",5,1,0,Jane L.,"Brooklyn, NY",9,62,239
1.0,3/14/2015,"The rustic atmosphere was very inviting as was the staff - very professional and courteous....and that's where the good experience ended.  We ordered a salad with root vegetables and goat cheese and a second appetizer of baked clams.  The salad was drenched in vinegar and the veggies tasted like they were long past their due date.  The baked clams had peas all over them ??? and many of the clams only had the baked breading -- NO CLAMS -- what a rip off.  I asked the waiter to recommend a dish, he chose the fried mixed seafood.  My first piece tasted like pure salt, so I tried another thinking that piece was the exception -- not so - pure saline solution.  I took off the breading and then realized why they needed to cover up everything with breading and salt -- all of the seafood underneath was rubbery and had no flavor.  My guest ordered the Zuppa de Pesce - and was also disappointed in the lack of flavor.  We only had soft drinks and no dessert and this disappointing meal cost well over $100 - not worth it at even at half the price.  Given the reputation of the owners, we were sorely disappointed.  We could have gotten a better meal at 1/4 the price across 9th Avenue at the Diner.  Steer clear of this overly expensive, over-rated place.  Those lending their name to this restaurant should be very ashamed and it truly makes me question their reputations.  Never again!",1,0,0,Kathy T.,"Manalapan, NJ",0,6,0

But I was extremely disappointed with my last visit to Esca.I ve been to Esca once before and enjoyed myself, so I was very excited to come back for lunch during Restaurant Week.For a high end restaurant I figured their pre fix menu was bound to be delicious. I was unfortunately wrong.I got raw fish for an appetizer since the waitress said it was the best fish in the city...The plate came with 3 bite size raw fish. The piece in the middle was so tough and stringy I couldn't even cut through it with a knife. I let the waitress know and showed her the horrible piece of fish and she seemed confused...I ended up not eating itThe second course was butter fish. It was 2 pieces of small whole FRIED fish... Filled with so many tiny bones and rib bones that I barely find any of the flavorless fish of it's own... My plate was a mess piled with bones and I am starving...Then I looked over to people sitting next to me and they knew exactly the pain I was going through... They said their appetizer was burnt and had the same problem with the fish and that they didn't even finish eating it... I told the confused waitress again and then a snarky manager came over saying there is pretty much nothing wrong with the fish.. Anyway ... She brought me ravioli instead from the restaurant week menu..

2.0,2/7/2015,"I don't get the hype for this place. While some things Esca serves are great (raw oysters, crudos), some are just plain awful and unacceptable. We started with a chef's treat, mackerel on toast. It was pretty good but looked really ugly (see pictures below).The raw oysters were delicious, shucked very clean, and adorned with lemon, mignonette, and chili oil (which I didn't care much for). The waiter also offered to grate fresh horseradish tableside for us which was something I've never seen done before, but unfortunately a different waiter cleared our horseradish plates midway through the oyster course.We dabbled and ordered the razor clam crudo. I'm a sucker for razor clams whenever I see them on the menu, and I was glad I ordered it. The mint, scallions, and chilies emphasized the flavor of the razor clams, but the distinct flavor of the olive oil overwhelmed me a bit. It was also a little awkward eating from such thin razor clam shells, even though the presentation was beautiful.My entree -- golden spotted bass -- came shortly afterwards. The fish was cooked nicely but lacked any true flavor. The broccolini it was served alongside looked sad and drab in color, as if it had been boiling for hours. Our sides of beets, broccoli, and fennel did little to elevate our moods.Service is attentive, police, friendly, and smart, and the restaurant is a beauty to sit in. I just wish the food could match.

5.0,2/2/2015,"I cant believe this place only has a 3 and a half star average.  I have a new understanding of Yelp Reviews.  It was definitely one of the best seafood restaraunts Ive ever eaten at.  I was going to give it only 4 stars, but I have to bump it because, people, this is Batali/Bastianich restaraunt. The greatest Italian food team in NYC. The folks who brought you Eataly and Del Posto.      Here's my one complaint. DONT LET THEM DEBONE ANYTHING. There were 3 couples, each splitting one large fish.  We're Greek,  like everybody else around the world, we eat fish whole.  'White' America, who are just European immigrants whose families have been here too long for them to have any European culture left, get squeamish about food.  In ways that the rest of the world laughs at, like any clue that the meal walked or swam once. Seafood with a head on it.   We said we want them whole. BUT, The waiter suggested we do a split and share, get the biggest fish for 2, so everybody gets to have everything else. The biggest fish are the tastiest after all. Wild caught Bronzini, a Florida fish I forgot, this was going to be awesome.     Big mistake, they did the 'remove bone' thing, like we're spoiled Americans who cant bear to see a bone or actually eat a fish the right way, and I could see tons of fish on the main table as they carved in the center of the dining area. Fish we paid premium prices for being removed and thrown out so that the filets we were given were all nice and symmetrical and pretty.  SO much was thrown out, that I understand why other commenters are saying things like 'we had to eat after we ate'. In a place like this, presentation is everything,  so all that inconveniently located meat near dorsal and medial bone is thrown out, everything except the one main portion of bone free meat is thrown out, or devoured by hungry kitchen staff, or fed to the basement cats.  Lucky bastards.    DONT ask them to filet. In fact, unless your only paying 18$ for a fish, or you're not hungry, NEVER have a restaurant filet it for you.  Learn to eat fish with bones, or don't eat real seafood. Go to Long John Silver's or something.  For everybody else, go to Esca.   DEFINITELY order the Crudo. Its awesome. It turns out Italian Fishermen have been eating their own Sashimi forever.  Take a raw fish that's just been caught, add extra virgin olive oil and sea salt.  Amazing. Ever since Ive been planning to get some Sashimi grade fish and have an Italian/Japanese Crudo/Sushi dinner.  Half with Soy and wassabi, half with the Olive Oil and sea salt. The quality of the oil and salt are the most important, no morton's salt and California olive oil on sale.    Esca brought Crudo to America, and were made fun of at first, ""Italian Sushi??""  But its backed by tradition and generations of Hungry Fishermen.",6,3,3,Roo M.,"WHITESTONE, NY",126,37,2
1.0,1/31/2015,"I don't get this place.  Despite having reservations weeks in advance, we were seated at a long table just inside of the front door that was shared with other diners.  This might be acceptable at a pastry shop but not at a place with these prices.  Since I only see one other reviewer taking issue with this I have to wonder how gullible this restaurant's patrons are.  Part of what you are paying for is space.  The other issue was the cold air blowing in from the front door.  I have never been so cold in a restaurant and it is always my wife that is cold, not me.  Last night, we were all freezing cold.  My feet were freezing from the air coming across the floor every time the door would open and I had thick leather dress shoes on.  Before leaving, I told a guy who appeared to be a manager that inquired how our dinner was that the table was freezing and that they shouldn't seat people there.  His response was, ""huh, everyone always tells us it is too hot in here"".  Perhaps in the summer...  Glad he cared.  Also, since we were crammed in like sardines, I couldn't hear anything other than the other unwelcome guests at our table personal conversations about how many times she had been married and the rest of her life's plans.  It was so loud that I gave up asking our waiter to repeat himself.  How ridiculous that we couldn't have any kind of meaningful conversation.As for the food, we had two warm and one cold appetizer, we split a squid ink pasta, and had two entrees.  One of the appetizers, the razor clams, was full of sand which is inexcusable.  The food, other than razor clams, was decent but the portions were small and could have been better seasoned.  One of the entrees was the Branzino and I swear they must have served another table the same fish because the servings were so small.  We ordered a bottle of wine that was $110.  My wife googled the bottle back at the hotel and found that it was a $30 bottle of wine.  $60-80 would be acceptable.  Anything more is just insulting.  I ordered one extra glass of wine and after tip our meal was well over $400.  I agree with the other reviewers that say this place is for tourists.  The markup on the wine says it all and apparently there are a lot of patrons of this restaurant that don't know when they are getting ripped off.  Don't be a sucker and go to this restaurant.  If I could give it negative stars I would.",0,0,0,Brian C.,"Manhattan, NY",0,1,0

4.0,1/16/2015,"I recently went to Esca for a work dinner. The restaurant was conveniently located a mere block away from my hotel, which was extremely fortunate as it was below twenty degrees and I could barely feel my ears, fingers and toes! (I'm a Floridian; I don't do well in the cold!) My company reserved the semi-private dining area and had a set menu. The only negative I would say is that the restaurant gets quite loud as it is on the small side, thus it was difficult to hear people, especially when speaking to the entire group (the private dining area isn't closed off entirely from the rest of the establishment). Now, on to the food! We had a set menu since it was a business dinner; it consisted of six courses. We started off with marinated olives and the polipo (grilled octopus with giant corona beans served over bread). These were both delicious and they were able to accommodate a colleague who had a gluten allergy. Next up was the crudo--I don't recall which exact types of fish were included, but they were all delicious and I'm not normally a fan of sashimi. Following the crudo, my insalada mista was pretty basic...nothing to write home about. Up next, I had the Gnocchi di Ricotta and the Lampuga alla Siciliana.

3.0,1/10/2015,"Yes and No - emphatic on both of those.   Started the night (Christmas Eve) at the bar with a fantastic bartender named Charlie who couldn't have been any more pleasant and accomodating.  Made great recommendations, really loves his job and obviously believes in Esca.  The host staff was incredibly friendly and festive and made for a perfect start.  After precocktails we were seated at a table in the dining room abutting a community table that was about 4 inches taller than the one we were seated at.  Talk about feeling like we got seated at the kids table for the holidays - just kind of a weird scenario as the lady sitting next to me at the community table and I rubbed shoulder to waist - very uncomfortable considering how close and off sized the seating and tables were.   The waiter spoke so fast that with his Italian accent we had no idea if there were any specials or anything else he said.  We asked him to repeat the specials/feast of 7 fishes and he did but almost faster than before as he rolled his eyes at us, obviously too busy with all of his other guests.   We opted not for the feast of 7 fishes since we had questions about two of the dishes but didn't dare try to ask him anything.   Started with the crudo sampler and it was delicious and well presented.  Ordered the whole salt crusted branzino and in another fit of being terribly rushed, someone from the kitchen (or maybe the same waiter, we couldn't tell as it was all such a blur), raced by the table, interrupted us and said, ""here is your brrrrranzzzino"" and poof, was gone like we'd wiggled our noses and in bewitched fashion made him disappear.   My wife began to turn around to see who was talking to us and there was no one there by the time she moved her head 3 inches.  The fish came out filleted nicely but it was incredibly small in portion size for $72.00.  It was also awfully bland - even a hint of pink salt or something would have been helpful.  Again, didn't want to try and ask our mysterious waiter for anything as he was a) nowhere in sight and b) so harried we didn't want to have eyeballs rolled at us again.   Desserts affogoato (lousy and sloppy) and something else, were fine but the highlight of those were the grappa and amaro that Charlie (remember Charlie, the awesome bartender?) had recommended earlier.   The sommelier gentleman was pleasant and helpful and he did keep an eye on our wine glasses through the night so hats off to him.$340 before tip later we left feeling disappointed in the food and crazy pace but there was nothing horrible about our visit.   Charlie and the host staff were stellar but I don't know if that's enough to bring us back to Esca again in the future.  In hindsight, we should have known this was exactly what to expect as many of the reviews on various sites stipulate how poor the service is.  It's not poor by any means but it is anything but relaxing and peaceful.   I even tried emailing the GM a month before going to get his thoughts and had to get in touch with their privates event coordinator twice.  TWICE before he replied and then it was as vanilla of a reply as you could imagine.   Might have been a nice thought to stop by and touch tables throughout the night on an evening such as Christmas Eve but then again if that had been thought of, those other review on poor service probably wouldnt' have been written.Esca - such potential, such big names behind the restaurant but maybe some of those big names should spend some time inside the doors rather than just on signing the paychecks.  You've got a beautiful restaurant and Charlie himself can bring many more guests back in but there's so much that needs fine tuning.All the best for a happy 2015,-Michael",0,0,0,Michael M.,"Leesburg, VA",0,61,1

I then had the spaghetti with lobster, which was quite good,  while everyone else (at least those still hungry after ""sharing"" my appetizer) had the Branzino. For dessert, I ordered the ricotta cheesecake, which once again was passed around the table. The few bites I had were quite tasty.

Short answer: no, it wasn't Long answer:Started off with the crudo tasting which our waiter explained to us is an Italian style raw seafood. I'm always up for raw food. We had  1 tiny cut per flavor (super stingy). For the $30 price, I could've gotten a Chirashi dish with double the amount of seafood. the crudo had raw shrimp, tuna, white fish, fish roe, some other fish that was very bland.

We would wind up chatting as he sat with me at the small bar area where I chose to eat.  I had no idea what a pleasant time I would have.As I walked in, on a very quiet day in December, I felt immediately welcomed by the hostess.Next, after being set up with immaculate white cloth placemat and oversized napkin, I was served a fantastic Malbec by the amiable bartender. I already felt like I was in the lap of luxury.There were lovely long and thin breadsticks in tall glasses.  An amusee bouche arrived, shortly, confusing of a white bean tapenade on crusty bread and accompanied by black olives in chili oil and more breads -- offered by Dave, himself. As for the food.  I loved the tuna carpaccio and the grilled Octopus with giant beans and preserved lemon was very special.  Never had anything like it.There are many more dishes I would like to try here- including the flights of crudos, the pastas and the Branzini fish available on the evening menu.The best part, besides the food, was being able to sit in a world class restaurant where they were classy enough to be down to earth.  To be able spend a few relaxing hours and chat with the master chef and fisherman and watch him create the menu for the evening was an experience I'll never forget.  Plus, I was regaled by stories about the famous celebrities by the bartender.It was was one of those magical New York Citymoments.  I don't know if everyone is going to belucky enough to have what I had -- but you shoulddefinitely come for the food alone and the ambience!I know I will.  Highly recommend!",5,2,6,Judith G.,"New York, NY",532,252,80

4.0,12/5/2014,"Very unique food. Great atmosphere. Definitely something I was extremely excited to try. It was pretty packed (albeit on a Saturday night), but we sat at the bar and our bartender/server took complete care of us. The service was just warm and wonderful (however, that might have had something to do with us having connections there). My friend ordered two trays of the chef's signature invention called ""crudo,"" which my pal likes to call Italian sushi. (Not quite). They were a variety of sashimi quality morsels sitting in baths of different uniquely flavorful olive oil. The trays are even designed to be tasted from left to right. The next course was squid ink pasta. Incredibly flavorful and hardy. The sauce was absorbed by the pasta perfectly. Next was Esca's signature dish, the Branzino. They show you that it's salt-crusted (covered in a 2 or 3-inch-thick cocoon of salt.) They break it open like ice and carefully fillet the thing in front of you- or in our case, behind us.

2.0,11/12/2014,"We had reservations for 8:30 on a Monday and all guests arrived about 10 minutes before that. We were invited to wait at the bar, an inconvenient, infinitesimal space (maybe 6 stools?) to the right of entrance. The kitchen is situated further to the right, and waiters are constantly bustling between there and the main dining room, traversing a very narrow space. There is also a table whereon dishes are decamped and plated before going out to the dining rooms, and  wine is uncorked. In addition, several tables are jammed in the corner beyond the bar, further adding to the Penn Station at 5:30 ambience. Not a relaxing start to the evening.At 8:45, the maitre d came over an apologized for the delay, saying it should be soon. At 9, he came again, saying that several tables were pokey, lingering overly-long with dessert, but that it would be soon. That was appreciated for sure, but still, it was 9:15 before we were seated. We were seated in a corner of the main dining room, and all tables in the room were still full. Despite our corner space, it was very difficult to understand  what the servers were saying. It's not that the music was loud or the room was made with sound-bouncing materials, but the room was seemingly filled with white noise.Overall, what struck me was the service was not particularly good for a restaurant whose price point would seem to indicate that excellent service is a given. There was a vibe of aggressive efficiency married with standoffishness. I'm not a fan of waiters who are obsequious spectres, startling you as they appear next to you to silently remove your salad fork, but the gusto with which the staff changed out silverware made me think of a truckload of Marines falling out, establishing a perimeter, and proceeding to kick in some doors. The server refilling water glasses skidded up to the table and shot out his arm with the pitcher, no matter where on the table your glass was. It was startling every time. We had been seated late, and the service seemed to reflect the later hour--disinterested, rote. We were told what was no longer available, and requests for recommendations did not generate any attempts at ""what do you like?""--it was simply ""this is good."" On the plus side, the waiter's recommendation to forego the Maine Belon oysters was on the money. Not sure they tasted metallic as he described, but they were not particularly good. And speaking of money, when all was said and done, it struck me that the food was overpriced. From the crudo tasting menu, the Spanish Mackerel tasted less of mackerel and more of the oil dressing it. The Brodetto (clams and mussels in a spicy pumpkin broth) was quite good, with spicy and sweet nicely balanced. The grilled octopus was all right, but something in the dish (the corona beans?) suggested breadcrumbs. Of the crispy rainbow smelts with caper-tarragon aioli, the flavor takeaway was ""fried."" And it's only after going back to look at the menu that I see that it was ""crispy pasta"" I was eating as part of the Pesce Nera. So that's what that was...I understand the quality/quantity equation, but price and portions seemed out of whack. Spaghetti and lobster was tasty (though the pasta seemed undercooked); it was not a 1-lb lobster as advertised but a half a crustacean for $30. A small portion of local blackfish (in the Pesce Nera) is $36?  Disappointing given its reputation. Thank goodness the company was excellent!",1,0,0,Colin G.,"Rahway, NJ",0,5,0

We were seated in the outdoor area. Aside from the light being a little dim it was very pleasant. These kids are well traveled and have pretty mature palates so that wasn't an issue. I was impressed with the service. Our waiter from very on point the whole meal. The french fries of the sea are these tiny white fish that are fried in a batter. I had one of the pastas that had sea food. Everyone really enjoyed their meal. My 2nd visit was an early dinner a few weeks ago after a matinee. We did not have a reservation but were seated (granted in a table by the kitchen but I was glad we were seated. We shared the french fries of the sea and I had the Autumn Salad-so good the ricotta was very tasty and whatever the sauce along with the vegetables was really good. Once again I had one of the pastas. My friend had the spaghetti with lobster which I tried and I think that was the best entree I have had between the two visits.

4.0,9/16/2014,"So, this is one of Mario and Joe's restaurants in the city. It says on their website, Esca ""is a southern Italian trattoria devoted to celebrating the fruits of the sea."" Fish - crudo and cooked whole fish - is their speciality; however, there are a few options for non fish-eaters as well. Esca is located in the Theater District; an area of the city I typically avoid; however, this is one of the few restaurants in this area worth your business. Not a whole lot of Times Square/Theater District-from the middle-of-nowhere-tourists eating here. Anyway, being a vegetarian, I ordered the one and only vegetarian dish - the Gnocchi Di Ricotta with tomato, basil and bufala mozzarella. It was really fantastic; the gnocchi was both light and delicious. The red sauce was excellent, not a typical marinara, but fairly smooth and extremely flavorful. The bufala mozzarella complimented the dish as it was warm, but not melted. My appetizer, the Insalata di Granoturco with roasted corn, chanterelles, walnuts and aged goat cheese, while very good, was also $19.

5.0,9/9/2014,"Overall a  nondescript spot on 43rd street, but what a fabulous experience. The service started a little edgy, but it is New York, so it was just fine. Server was excellent and flexible, attentive yet not overwhelming. it is about the food and the experience and it really was a great journey. We shared a couple of pastas as an appetizer (sardines and the sea urchin/.crab). The pasta was homemeade and cooked to perfection , al dente and filling - it has a more dense texture which allows for the ingredients to bond to it and which really gives a more satisfying feeling after eating it. The seasonng was a little on the salty side, but I am not sure if it was the ingredients or the heavy handed chef....  Either way, the blend of tastes was exquisite an deep - for example the sea urchin somehow came in pieces which were sashimi quality and accented the creamy taste of the sauce and the pasta. Plenty of crab too...  Entree was the seabass which was deboned and served with capers and olives. Perfectly cooked and the accompanying sides (beets, beans fennel etc) were roasted with some lemon and were a perfect complement to the dish. The octopus was a huge hit and the size of it as well as the tenderness and the accompaniments made a beautiful combination of taste and texture that worked well. Overall excellent experience.

1.0,9/7/2014,"I went to Esca while in New York on a trip, hoping to have some good Italian food. When we first arrived, a man came up to us and asked us if he could help us. After we told him we had reservations, he told us that he can't help us and we need to wait for a hostess. Why come up and ask then? After we were seated it took 10 minutes for anyone to come up to us, even though it was not very crowded. We ordered two cocktails. After 10 more minutes of waiting, a different waiter came up and asked us if we want anything. We told him we ordered cocktails but they haven't arrived yet. After many more minutes of waiting, we finally got our cocktails. Then, the two waiters began to fight with each other right next to us over who would be serving our table, which made us very uncomfortable. Another long wait after we ordered food, we got bread. The focaccia was so rough, dense and tasteless it was like eating a brick. It was also so burned on the edges my fingers were black from handling it. When our food came, we noticed that half of the roasted potatoes we ordered were completely burned. They were little black coals, instead of potatoes. I calmly asked our waiter if they could replace the burned ones with ones that are not burned, especially since the dish of simple potatoes was pretty expensive. The waiter rudely answered back ""You want something else then."" I replied, ""No. We'd just like for the ones that are burned to be replaced, since it's half the dish that is inedible."" The waiter took our plate and left in a huff. He came back a few minutes later, threw our plate down, which was half empty because they simply took the burned ones off without replacing them and said: ""How's this? You like this?"" He then left before I could say anything. I asked another person working in the restaurant if we could see the manager. The people sitting next to us were shocked at how the waiter acted and that we had gotten no apology for the food. The food that was not burned was so mediocre, it did not justify the prices they were charging.When the manager was coming over, he asked in a sarcastic tone: ""How can I help you ladies?"" I told him what the problem was, and he replied that he'd take the potatoes off our bill. He did not apologize. He then came back and asked if we wanted dessert. I asked for our bill, so we could leave because we were very unhappy with how we were being treated. He acted shocked that we wouldn't want to have dessert. I asked if he would apologize to us. He began saying in an irritated tone that he already apologized. He did not. As I waited for the bill to come, I looked around the room. At every single table in sight people were very unhappy. The only happy patron I saw was a gentleman sitting next to us who was friends with the manager and was making racist and sexist comments to his dinner companion throughout the night. The couple sitting next to us who were there to celebrate their wedding were getting terrible service as well, and were also complaining about the bad food and experience. For a restaurant that charges such ridiculous prices, they should, at least, ask their staff to treat their customers better. I had never had such a poor dining experience before. I would not recommend this place to anyone. Save your nerves and money, and eat at any other place in the city. I think you'd get better food at a hot dog stand. You'd definitely get better service!

2.0,8/2/2014,"While I thought the food was good, the experience was colored by the service. Our table of four never felt as if we were being properly served. We had to ask repeatedly for bread, water, and salt and pepper. (They were happy to ask us about the liquor.) The worst of the experience, however, was our waiter who, as it turns out, scammed us. My husband and I decided to share the Bronzino for two. Our waiter asked if we wanted appetizers, and we said no as we had to make the theatre and were running late. He said, ""Well, the Bronzino takes a half hour, so you'll just be sitting here,"" so we decided to order an appetizer. He was also rather pushy about ordering side dishes and seemed a little abrupt when we declined. Well 50 minutes later, we were still waiting for our fish  and I complained to the maitre'd and he told us that the fish is not started until the appetizers are finished.  I could not believe that we had been duped like this!! I would not have ordered the appetizer if I had known that. The maitre'd assured we would have time, but we had to rush and did not have time for coffee.  At the end of the day, the food was not worth the annoying experience.",0,0,0,Cheryl K.,"Nutley, NJ",1,4,0

We asked our waiter if we could place the order for the appetizers first & order dinner a bit later, as we wanted to enjoy our bottle of wine & catch up. We were very sternly told ""No . You have to order everything now."" Ok!We asked if our lobster shell could be removed for us (the lady has trouble with her hands so she's unable to attempt such tasks). We were, again sternly told ""No! We leave them on for flavor & they're easy enough to remove."" Which by the way was not the case - tough to remove. I asked why they were so strict? The waiter responded ""I don't make the decisions. The chef is very famous and very big. He's very strict."" Apparently Mario Batali is too big even for his customers. This is the message we got.We felt terrible that our friend was unable to take the meat out of her lobster & her husband did it for her, while his food got cold. When he complained to the manager that he was mislead about the easiness of taking the meat out of the lobster, all he got were excuses & we were told again how particular the chef is. I've certainly had strange experiences at restaurants but not one as bizarre as this one. We are sorry that our one special night together was spent at ESCA. As much as We can appreciate the chef's desire to have things his way, he must remember that the customer is his boss & should be better accommodated. Thank you.",0,1,0,Dua C.,"Greenwich, CT",0,37,0
2.0,7/22/2014,"I've dined at every Batali restaurant in New York and after finally trying Esca I'm sad to say one trait they all share is OVERPRICED MEDIOCRITY. First, let me say I went with someone who is a close friend with Mario, who wasn't there that night, but the staff knew my date well so I'm assuming the treatment we got was the best Esca has to offer. I'm glad we didn't sit inside, the decor in the dining room is quite drab and uninviting, as others have said, the lighting is awful. We were seated outside on a beautiful, clear summer evening in the nice garden, but we kept getting dripped on by what I can only assume was air conditioner condensation, although no one seemed to know just exactly what it was or where it came from. We asked to be moved and we two were whisked to a table for four, no worries, but still got dripped on, albeit less often. The bread was terrible, whole wheat focaccia tasted like it was a day old. We started with oysters which were good, but in light of the waiter's gushing recommendation I was underwhelmed. Crudo tasting was just meh, the olive oil each piece was pooled in was more memorable than the fish. Radicchio salad was good but overdressed. We shared the whole Branzino, which was very good but nothing particularly world-rocking. I ordered grilled fennel as a side which was my favorite dish. Our dessert was the sorbet trio which was fine. The service was wacky, we had like three different waiters, each was confused about something, did we order wine, one asked, another didn't know if we had ordered mains yet because menus were still on the table (we had, but they weren't picked up). Different waiters came by our table to ask how everything was several times, which annoyed me, I mean, once per course is good but it was more than that and interrupted our conversation. It's like there's no communication going on there!I didn't want my dinner companion to know how disappointed I was by the whole experience, but after having similar experiences at Babbo, Del Posto and Lupo I'm done with Batali's empire.

After some time you will figure out to look around the corner and find the hostess place. We were seated in an area after the bar. Four tables are squeezed there in a place for three. If you are seating on the couch, there is no way you can get out without moving the tables. Nearby Schnippers and McDonalds have more room between the tables. Regarding serving. We were brought a wine list, however, the menu was not given to us for another 20 minutes. I had to ask for it. Nearby table had an even longer menu wait as they were too shy to ask for it, I guess. We decided to try the tasting menu, which is supposed to give you a taste of the best in Esca. Each course took about 30 minutes to arrive and except for the fish liver (ok, it was pretty good) food was nothing special. After 4 courses and 2.5!! hours we said that we're paying right now and leaving. And the courses sizes are minuscule. I think the whole tasting menu can fit only half of a normal plate. We left hungry, angry and about 240$ lighter in our wallets. Outrageously bad! I'd never step into this place again or any other place of its owners. Stay away!!!",0,0,0,Igor A.,"Secaucus, NJ",0,8,2
1.0,6/19/2014,"I don't usually take the time to write reviews--and when I have they are because I have been afforded incredible service/product/food and so forth. I am in NYC for a conference and got the recommendation from a Seattle friend to have an exquisite meal at ESCA while in town. So, I convinced my NYC friend to trek across town with me on a human manned bike to the tune of $48 in the heart of traffic to ESCA. The wait staff, hostesses and maître d were great. They made room for us and we snuggled up with drinks and perused the menu. She is vegetarian and I'm veggie/fish eater. We placed orders BUT the amazing waiter returned to tell us that the chef wouldn't make the vegetable my friend had chosen without cheese. My friend--quite the New Yorker calmed herself to accommodate my Southern/Midwestern mannerisms. ""Fine"" she said, ""just the salad."" The waiter returned and told us there was a 2-appetizer minimum or 1 entrée. Mind you I've ordered a $14 cocktail plus an appetizer and entrée to the tune of $70. With more to follow .... She acquiesced again--for the benefit of her out of town guest. But when the chef sent the waiter BACK stating he wouldn't tell her what was in the veggie entrée she pieced together we'd both had enough. Unbeknown to each other we both asked for the manager who told us he did what the chef wanted and had nothing to do with it!!! So--he wears the suit but not the pants?? We paid for our drinks and were hurriedly escorted out. I even stopped my friend from roaring through the place in true NYC fashion--like she or any other person would have been inclined to do. It was appalling, embarrassing and disrespectful. What was even worse is that the whole time the chef paced back and forth in front of our table fuming that he would even be asked to accommodate the two women poised to spend upwards of $200 on a casual Wed. night (Instead of in the kitchen improvising by removing cheese!!). He was an egotistical fuck. Red faced and furious that he had to tell us about or MILDLY accommodate us regarding what WE were eating. I won't be returning to ESCA and if your like me and my friend who've eaten great meals all over the world.... you know you don't have to deal with an egotistical chef run restaurant with a weeny manager who won't advocate for patrons who ask that NO CHEESE be on their vegetables or be informed about WAHT veggies might be in a substitute dish.

We got there promptly at 5 and it was another 7 minutes before we could get in as the restaurant was busy setting up. The restaurant has a lovely atmosphere and I appreciated the 40's/50's style crooner music. Our server, Peter, started out polite and attentive. We didn't really have questions about the menu, so we couldn't test his knowledge, though I suspect he would have passed with flying colors. The scrambled egg appetizer might have seemed like an odd choice at an Italian restaurant, but it may have been the best scrambled eggs I ever had. The gnocchi was good, though nothing out of this world. The FRITTO MISTO AMALFITANO was a joke. Like the description read it was crispy mixed seafood, but I would have expected something a little more presented than a pile of fried seafood. And the seasoning left something to be desired. Quite honestly, I've had better dishes at Red Lobster. If Peter had bothered coming back to ask how everything was I'd have mentioned my disappointment. But he never did come back as he was too busy chatting up the other tables he had. We only saw him again when he asked if we wanted desert. Which we didn't. Overall, the service went from attentive to dismal. At least the bus boy kept the water glass filled which was good because Peter never did ask if we wanted refills on our drinks. When you're dropping $126 on a meal, it might not be a bad idea. I wouldn't go again, personally.

I've see Chef Pasternak on TV and was entranced by his love for the art and care of the seafood product he so perfectly serves.  This Italian seafood eatery is all about the crudo but other courses were excellent as well.This review is a tale of two experiences. First the food. Outstanding in every way. The big eye salmon crudo was exquisite . Perfectly seasoned but left so simple to truly enjoy the natural flavor of the fish. I literally could have sat and had crudo throughout my meal and been very happy. The rest of the meal was excellent also. I had a fillet of Black Bass that was simply stunning. Once again the fish was treated with respect (and note the word respect going forward here) and simplicity. It was spectacular.We were fortunate enough to be seated next to a lovely couple that were in their nineties. They were so cute together with him sharing some of his wine and clearly (after 53 years of marriage.....we asked) still very much in love. When their bill came their was an item on it that they  had sent back. The waiter seemed very annoyed by the issue. After they left our waiter apologizes to us??? for him being a little cross. He explains that the older couple did not know how to order correctly and Chef yelled at him for wasting food. Ridiculous reaction to an easily handled issue.... I'm in hope that the waiter put my tip and his words / actions together. Respect your customers and, for God's sake man, respect an elderly couple out for a meal!Waiter's actions took a star off.

Wow, that was tasty.  Although our group had to chuckle, since we were expecting calamari like you normally get it: cut up into rings and breaded.  We got a plate with A calamary... as in ONE.  One entire, not cut-up calamari.  It was probably the best calamari I've ever had!2) Burrata... we are all fans of burrata, but this was a bit underwhelming.  Not as creamy as I've had it in the past, but the broccolini was fantastic!For entree I had the sea-salt baked Branzino.  What a fantastic dish that was.  The branzino is baked in an ""igloo"" (for the lack of better words) of sea salt.  We asked for it to be filleted.  Probably the best fish I've had... EVER!

As the day went on, my friends and I were getting a bit tired and had a few more pals wanting to join, so we showed up taking a chance to see if we could be seated for a party of 5 and at 6:30 instead of 7:30. We knew that chances were slim of that happening as it is a small restaurant in the heart of Midtown, but William (who we couldn't tell if he was a manager or the maitre'd) was SO nice, friendly, and helpful. He asked us to wait a few moments to see what he could do, and before we knew it, we were being seated. Our server (whose name I believe was Tom), was super patient and friendly as we waited for the final person in our party to show up before choosing what carafes of wine to order. Once our 5th person arrived, our server was great about giving us recommendations, and even going a step further. When we would order a more ""unusual"" dish, he offered a more descriptive flavor profiling of the dish so we knew what we were getting into without us even asking! It was a huge help. Food: A friend and I couldn't decide what we wanted, so we opted to order 2 apps, 2 entrees and 2 desserts and share them with each other. Appetizers: we had the monkfish liver with a maple glaze (ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC), and the clams with cherry bomber peppers and toasted breadcrumbs. They were flavorful and rich. For entrees: we shared the unbelievable ricotta gnocchi and the pan seared monkfish with horseradish mashed potatoes. Both dishes were satisfying and great portions. It's nice to go a restaurant where everything you eat tastes fresh and homemade-a simple thing you would hope for when dropping $$ at a culinary establishment! The desserts: the bread pudding and the Abbogado (sp?)....the latter was a creamy gelato in a glass with homemade lady fingers, chocolate chips and then drenched in warm espresso. So good! And the bread pudding with the creme fraiche gelato was divine. We will definitely be coming back, and to try the tasting menu next time!! 5 stars for decadent food, friendly and attentive service, and a great time. *Only negative is they dropped the check without us asking for it when we had planned on having one more cocktail.

I could understand a charge - like when you BYOB of nice wine to a restaurant, they charge a corkage fee. So, I'm fine with a fee BUT a $75 charge for a $30 cake is exorbitant! There were 5 people at my table so I could see charging the equivalent of one dessert per person so $25 would have been understandable. But to rip someone off for wanting a cake that says happy birthday name is just not right......especially when high priced bottles of wine and a lot of food were already ordered.Lesson learned...........always call ahead to any restaurant that you want to do something a little different at.

2.0,1/21/2014,"Oh so disappointing.  Had such high expectations given Zagat's review.  My friend and I had a 5:45pm reservation and were promptly greeted at the door by a hostess who asked if she could take our coats.  We initially thought we would check the coats, and after a moments thought we both decided to keep them.  Our decision was met with a very clear nonverbal expression of disapproval.  It was truly one of the oddest things and NOT a pleasant way to start an upscale dining experience.  Once we were seated, my friend pointed out that all the diners in our section had their coats with them and it annoyed me so much that we were treated in such a manner that I decided to say something to the manager.  Shock #2.  Instead of apologizing immediately, he became a bit defensive.  Now I work in a service industry and know to promptly apologize to the customer and ask what you can do to amend the situation or offer some kind words of assurance that the rest of the experience will be great.  So far, not ""upscale"" treatment.  As for the meal, the crudo was fine...nothing fantastic.  The burrata was subpar, rubbery and not very nicely displayed.  The fusilli with lobster was divine.  This was the only good part of the entire dining experience where the dishes came out so fast that we felt incredibly rushed. The manager did eventually make his way over to our table and asked if everything was okay and he did offer us a dessert on the house, but the standard was set from the moment we walked in.  Mario, come on.  I've watched you so many times on TV talking about the importance of the dining experience, not just the food.  Have you been recently to your own restaurant?  If you had had our experience, I'd hope that heads would fly.",0,0,0,Lori S.,"WYNNEWOOD, PA",0,2,0

2.0,12/29/2013,"We thought our crudo dishes (king salmon, mackerel, and pink snapper) were all excellent. We also received complimentary fried baitfish and olives, both were good. The whole wheat focaccia was very good as well. However, both of our pasta primi had major issues. While both were cooked properly al dente, my wife's pappardelle was overly salted and greasy - it was supposed to be a tuna-based bolognese but the pancetta and parmigiano dominated the dish and were unnecessary. My maccheroni w/ sea urchin and crab tasted good initially but I found it to be extremely heavy and overly decadent - had this before in Sicily and way too much dairy and/or egg in Esca's version. The overall heaviness in what were supposed to be southern Italian dishes was very disappointing, as we were hoping for authentic, light seafood dishes. Both pasta dishes were way too large for a primo portion (although I understand they are catering to those ordering pasta for their main, and price the pasta accordingly). We also ordered the sogliola for two and the fish was cooked very nicely but again a touch overly salted. It was also very disappointing to see Asian pine nuts in the garnish, as opposed to the longer Italian pignoli. The parsnip contorno was also way too buttery. The entire meal lacked a freshness and left us craving a pure, simple vegetable element.Despite these culinary missteps, the least enjoyable aspect of the meal was the service. We weren't offered oil and pepper for our bread and had to ask for it. Our waiter was disinterested and would disappear for significant stretches of time. Once he realized that we weren't ordering any more wine and, because of our filling pasta course we didn't order dessert, he quickly gave us the check - didn't even bring us some biscotti even though he did that for the table next to us, who also declined dessert. We did appreciate him providing the baitfish and the mackerel crudo (perhaps the highlight of the entire meal), and he initially offered us several wines to taste before selecting our quartini, but his attentiveness declined from there. We definitely felt a stuffy, snooty vibe from the vast majority of the staff. This is our second poor service experience dining in a Mario Batali restaurant (the other being Mozza in LA), and sadly I don't think we'll ever go to another one of his restaurants because of it.

I love the 80's, but when you're paying these prices and are trying to enjoy fine dining (supposedly), I can do without ""Girls Just Want to Have Fun"" and ""Electric Avenue"" in my ear.Just getting into the place is a hassle as there is almost no place to stand and there are waiter prep stations in the middle of everything (who designed the layout of this too-tiny place?)First courses and crudo were excellent (crudo tasting, tuna, octopus), but it's actually quite hard to choose a main course. There are plenty of pastas (stick with those), but very few actual main course fish dishes. Very odd for a...seafood restaurant. Two members of our party ordered the salmon, the waiter took our order, then returned a few minutes later to tell us they were out of salmon. Seriously? Isn't knowing what you're out of covered on day 1 of restaurant school? When dishes finally arrived, they mixed up two of the plates on the table. Not a big deal, but again--don't charge me $38 for a dish and not know who at the table ordered it. The out of luck salmon-diners split a whole fish for 2 which was brought to the table and displayed, taken away to filet and then not seen again for another 10-15 minutes when all dishes arrived.

Some have their plates in front of them others have it off to the left or off to the right. They bring out some olives (being Greek and having a clue about olives) these olives were alright. Little shits some good flavor. The cocktails are wretched! cheap ass liquor to go with everything. When asking the waiter what kind of vodka is in the Two-Minute Razor Martini the waiter told us it was house vodka. When asked again what kind of vodka it was he said ""the bottle just says vodka"".

Places like Marea were cut from the same cloth as Esca, but Esca is fancy while still casual and a bit less pricy, but don't let that fool you into thinking it isn't excellent; it is. They started us off with a pair of amuses bouches of olives and chilis in a spicy oil and a crostini with beans and I think tuna. Both very tasty and the accompanying bread is perfect to soak up the tasty oil (stick with the white bread, and ask for a few slices). To drink we had to try the razor clam martini. All of the favors are subtle and almost faint at first sip, but the spice and brine are there, not to mention some chunks of raw clams. If you like raw oysters and raw clams dirty martinis, you will like this. We each had the crudo sampler of six different ceviches. Really all were excellent, with the exception of the sea urchin (disclaimer: we were in Japan less than 2 months ago and ate urchin about 23 times). Moving on to the squid ink pasta, this is everything you love abut this kinda dish. The pasta is homemade, and you can tell that in the first bite. The mild seafood and spice flavors blend perfectly. Get this. The sea bass, which an interesting presentation, was just a well prepared fish; nothing earth shattering. It was moist and flavorful, but flavors you've had before. To finish up we had the gelato with brownies and espresso. I love desserts like this. It is all melty and the brownies soak up all the deliciousness. This is a place worth checking out for sure.

Enough that they ask us if we want our usual table when we make a reservation.I'd say we're damned good customers. We eat early. Really early. We know what we want, and make up our minds quickly. We eat fast. We tip well. We're in and out in 90 minutes--max. They can turn our table by 6:30, letting the special occasion people linger. No, we don't spend $1000, but our server will make $50-$60 for minimal interaction.Esca is kinda a tale of two restaurants. If I were to review the bar, I'd give it four stars. Victor is one of the best servers in NY. But the other guys? Brusque and sometimes dickish. Example: last night every guy who came by called me ""sir."" I understand I'm taller and more butch than most of the runners have seen in their home countries. I get that I'm not the most feminine looking woman in town. But the server did it--after we made eye-contact and had chatted about the menu. BTW, I have BIG breasts. Can't miss 'em. Still, I didn't correct him. My girlfriend did, though. She looked up and said, ""Really? You called her ""sir""?"" The guy just stared at her for a second, shrugged and walked away. Okay. Maybe he was embarrassed or whatever. But he never came back. Didn't check to see how our meal was. Didn't ask if we wanted another drink--which we did. Didn't offer dessert. Didn't offer coffee. Just swept by with the check after we'd finished. I found that dickish. Everybody makes mistakes and says things that might offend a customer. Just apologize and move on. Don't hide!I can tolerate dickish for great food. But we've noticed the menu is in a rut. We love the crudo, but it's $20 for a very small serving. So we usually get the sampler. $30--still really small. The salads are fairly experimental. Usually good. But the secondi are few and always kinda the same. If we both have crudo, salads, primi or secondi along with a vegetable we're at $150-without wine.

2.0,8/31/2013,"Here are the salient bits. It's expensive--very expensive--which wouldn't be a problem if the place weren't so solidly average. ""Welcome to Esca,"" says a man in an ill-fitting suit. Welcome, that is, to a profoundly unstylish and boring dining room with out-of-place music. Fine. How's the food? Decidedly mediocre. The famed crudo? Meh. And at $30.00 for six tiny pieces it should be more than meh. Grilled octopus? Again, fine, but I've had similar at middle-of-the-road tapas joints at half the cost. Vegetable sides? Did these come from a can? And why is the kale I ordered actually collard greens?""We're famous for the branzino."" That's odd, because it's nothing special, and at over $70.00 for two people, it should probably be the tastiest branzino on earth. ""Would you like dessert?"" Yes, and an espresso for me and a cappuccino for her. I would, though, not like the espresso to come out first, followed by the dessert 5 minutes later, followed by the cappuccino 4 minutes after that. Kind of messes up the course, you know? But oh well.And the sommelier? Who is this person? After completing her kindergarten checklist she recommends a bottle a full $20.00 more than the price ceiling ($90.00) she requested and I supplied. Her suit: also ill-fitting.  Bottom line: way too much money for a bland, mediocre, ordinary seafood place passing itself off as extraordinary for theatre-going out-of-towners.

It's a bit pricey but you get a fantastic variety and the first course of crudo is fantastic! Also if you'd like the tasting menu, be ready for a 2.5 hour meal. We loved that no one was pushing us out and could relax and enjoy a few bottles of wine between the four of us with dinner. Also the waiter was very helpful guiding us through the choices and recommended great wines, including a dessert wine that was not too sweet and was a perfect compliment to the dessert.

4.0,8/23/2013,"Have you ever had a wonderful date ruined by a horrible good night kiss? A magical night of building expectations suddenly shattered by a sloppy smooch?We always visit a Batali restaurant on our trips to NYC, and we saved Esca for our first night. Overall we really liked the atmosphere at Esca; it has a comfortable vibe like Lupa, but is a bit dressier like Babbo (but without the fussy service). They brought us a starter of white beans on toast with our cocktails (both were great). While enjoying the cocktails we ordered:* The corn and mushroom salad, which we both loved. Batali does fantastic things with roast corn (our favorite dish at Babbo is the roast corn). * We've always wanted to try fried squash blossoms, so we ordered those. They were light and crispy (pan fried, not deep fried) and stuffed with goat cheese; fantastic. * Then came the star of the dinner; capellini with lobster and shrimp.  Easily our favorite part of the meal. Order it, even if you have a severe allergy to shellfish. Seriously, it's that good.We agonized over the next dish. I'd read on Yelp that many diners loved the Fritto Misto here. My wife isn't a big fan of deep-fried stuff, but she sweetly relented. We waited a long time for it (hard to say how long because I had a bit of a buzz, but I think it was four days). When it finally came out it was inedible; tough and flavorless. Had it sat too long waiting for the server to pick it up? Or was it simply overcooked by an inattentive or hungover cook? I'll never know, but we sent it back, which I've done exactly twice in my life (once for a bug in my salad, once for a large steel box staple in my hamburger).To their credit, they handled it well. A manager didn't come over or anything dramatic like that, and they simply took it off the bill without any fanfare or drama. The server made a half-hearted apology, but after that he was clearly done with us. I was a bit deflated; I had denied my wife her desired next course because of the shitty deep-fried plate of shit that I'd insisted on. So we didn't order dessert, coffee, or a digestif. We weren't pissed, just really disappointed. I'm still giving them four stars because most of the experience was great. But still, that one bad dish almost torpedoed an otherwise wonderful meal. As I left the place I felt that the tepid grandma kiss of over-fried calamari had ruined a great date, but in retrospect I'd ask her out again for a second date and maybe skip right to second base.",7,2,0,Jeff R.,"Marin County, CA",63,115,82
5.0,8/19/2013,"You know those places that you are lucky enough to go to once bc someone else is footing the bill, and then you spend months hoping that you win the lottery so that you can go back?  Well for me, Esca is that place. (Disclaimer:  it's not as expensive as the Le Bernardins of the world or anything, but I'm a student, so my budgetary bar is set kinda low). It was not at all crowded when we went for lunch, and the service was great.  The waiter was veryyy enthusiastic and clearly had a passion for food and his job.  The food was unbelievable.  I have to admit, the appetizers were good but not memorable enough for me to recall them now,  but the squid ink pasta that I had for my entree was so delicious that I can still taste it if I close my eyes and try hard enough.The highlight of the meal, however, was the Affogato di Caffe, which was basically an espresso soaked cake with caramel gelato.  It was easily among the top 10 things I've ever eaten and I've been craving it ever since. Esca ain't cheap, and it's not especially ""trendy"" or ""hip"" or whatever the kids are saying these days, but if you're looking for some amazing food, look no further.",6,1,4,Prerna S.,"New York, NY",6,37,0
4.0,8/17/2013,"We were ecstatic to learn that Esca was participating in this year's Summer Restaurant Week.  Sadly, we had thought that this deal had applied to dinner, but, in actuality, it was solely available at lunchtime.  Upon our arrival, we were taken to a lovely table and greeted by a classy server.  We opened our elaborate menus and did not find a RW version.  We politely requested it, but were told that it was not available in the evenings.  I could have sworn that I had seen it listed online, which lead to our server apologizing profusely and saying that he would completely understand if we wanted to come back another time.  We threw the idea around, but in the end, we decided to finally give Esca a try, since we had wanted to check it out or quite some time.  A man came around to offer us alluring slices of bread.  The Whole Wheat Focaccia was doughy and fluffy, though its crispy top layer sprinkledwith sea salt was the true highlight.  Each slice of Italian Bread was sheer perfection with its moist interior and sticky, chewy crust.  Every table also received a small amuse of bruschetta topped with a chunky white bean puree, which was just as delightful.  We enjoyed our snack with some great drinks.  Our invented concoction of the housemade Madagascar Vanilla soda with a splash of rum came together to form a sweet, candy-like delight.  My quarttino of 2011 Scarbolo Sauvignon Blanc from Friuli was well-balanced and bright.Since we were not able to partake in the Restaurant Week menu, we decided to share each of our desired courses.  The kitchen was so thoughtful that they even divided up the portions prior to presenting them to us.  The Insalata Di Granoturcowas a fresh salad of seasonal and premium ingredients, such as roasted corn, chanterelles, walnuts, and aged goat cheese.  The starter was packed with various flavors and textures.  Our next course was one of my top 3 pasta dishes ever.  The Maccheroni Alla Chitarra was an unique homemade pasta (a guitar cut spaghetti) tossed with a fishy blend of sea urchin and crabmeat.   Ribbons of scallion garnished the plate and enhanced the bold flavor.  Though many renown Italian restaurants offer the mixture of uni and pasta, this version truly let both ingredients shine, without one overpowering the other.  A Whole Wild Striped Bass was expertly cooked and served with a warm, earthy blend of morel mushrooms and roasted beets.For dessert, we sampled the complimentary cookie plate, which we frankly thought seemed like it had been defrosted, with each bite tasting slightly of freezer burn.  This so-so platter was thankfully redeemed by the decadence that was the White Chocolate Mascarpone Cheesecake.  Now I am not usually a fan of this form of creamy dessert, but this particular version had a bold, yet sweet, balance that paired perfectly with the accompanying raspberries.From the respectful service to the top-notch food preparation, Esca provided an effortlessly refined experience.  Restaurant week or not, this place was a gem!",4,2,3,Alison C.,"Hoboken, NJ",1125,1410,640

2.0,8/9/2013,"Even though I am technically a NYC tourist (but in my heart I'm an honorary New Yorker), I really need to stick to my self-imposed rule of staying away from places where tourists go.  Esca is one of those such places.  I get the impression their main clientele is 50-something, deep-pocketed suburbanites who come into the city to see Wicked for the 15th time and drop a fat wad of cash on an average meal.That being said, my husband and I visited after seeing a show (albeit for the first time) and wanted to spend a medium sized wad of cash on a meal (it was our anniversary).  There were a number of things I didn't like about Esca.  First, they have a prep station in the middle of the restaurant.  Throughout the meal, the prep cooks would be deboning cooked fish about 2 feet away from us, which was cool to watch... at first.  By the end of the meal I wanted to barf from the smell of fish.  Secondly, I felt a little bit of an attitude from the waiter when he realized that we were just there for a meal of pasta dishes and weren't ordering a $75 fish dish or tasting menu.  Lastly, I just wasn't impressed by the food.  Upon recommendation from the waiter, I ordered the Maccheroni Alla Chitarra, which was a pasta dish with crab and sea urchin.  What I didn't realize that it was made with this really heavy cream based sauce.  It had the consistency of glue.  However, my husband ordered linguine with spicy clam sauce and called it the best meal he's ever had.  So, take my opinion with a grain of salt.Overall, the meal was just ok and for the price, I would have liked to enjoy it more.  Sorry M.

When you serve good quality fish with sides that are pretty much flavorless, you've ruined the entire meal. I opted for lemonfish which was cooked OK ( I asked for medium but the fish was definitely cooked medium rare). My friend ordered spaghetti which was OK too. They serve you a whole wheat foccacia bread along with your meal which really didn't taste like anything. We also ordered a salad of wild dandelion greens with anchovy vinaigrette. Sounds good right?

Finally went a few weeks ago for a friend's birthday and it is now probably my 2nd favorite Batali restaurant (only after Lupa).Service and decor were not too in your face but just the right amount of pleasant to make you feel comfortable and well taken care of. My first meal was fluke crudo and clam app (didn't love the fluke) and uni & crab pasta. The apps and wine were great but it was the uni & crab pasta that sent me over the edge. I was still thinking about that dish days later.

2.0,6/10/2013,"I recently dined at Esca for the first time. Having been a customer of most, if not all of the Batali/Bastianich restaurants, I was excited to try this one as I had always been so pleased in prior experiences. After seeing Chef Pasternak on tv a number of times, I felt like I would be in great hands. What I did not anticipate was leaving the restaurant so hungry, that we needed to go for another dinner after our dinner! I understand that restaurants need to make a profit, and that generally, the more upscale the restaurant, the smaller the portions, but COME ON with your portion size, you cannot sell these portions with a straight face and expect people to come back.Let me give some details on the experience:Decor: Very nice, simple, not a large restaurant, but large enough, with an outdoor seating area as well.Service: Very very very attentive. In fact, our server was so anxious to plow through our first bottle of wine that he almost re-poured me a glass when I was still in the middle of a sip (just kidding, but he was incredibly anxious to get us onto our second bottle, which was a bit off-putting). He was knowledgeable about the menu and walked us through some of the highlights. Food: Let me preface this by saying that the food was all GREAT, there just wasn't enough of it. We ordered a few crudo dishes which were all around $20 and included what I would call 1-2 pieces of sashimi sized fish. Went on to share the black bass with my wife, and after they were done cutting the fish into fillets, each portion was about 2 ounces. My portion of this pygmy fish was no joke approximately 5 inches long, by 2 inches deep and 1/4 inch thick. Tiny. I've had larger fish sticks. We also had the pasta a la chitarra which tasted amazing, even though my wife and I downed the plate in under 3 minutes. Given the fact that the bill was incredibly high, we felt less than thrilled with the overall experience.

4.0,5/9/2013,"I really liked Esca and overall and a big fan of Lidia and Batali. The food was superb but the reason why it isn't 5 stars is simply because I feel the place to be a tad overpriced for this style. I wouldn't characterize this as a ""fine dining"" place but the prices as set as such. I came for a Saturday lunch and loved the meal.Nice whole wheat focaccia. Would have been even better warmer. I like that they come around to offer seconds also.I started with their signature crudo, which the waited urged me to try since that is their namesake. I went with the fatty bigeye tuno crudo from the 10 or so choices. What I received was probably one thick slice of tuna cut into 4 smaller strips. Really fresh, pristine, and delicious crudo topped with just a drizzle of olive oil and salt. But the problem was it was a whopping $21 for a plate that vanished in literally 30 seconds.Next, I went with the fritti which was mixed fried seafood of blowfish tail, monkfish cheek, ramps, and steamers. This was a much more substantial plate and I didn't mind paying $18 for it. Perfectly fried, light batter allowed the fish to be the star of the plate. Nice mixture of tastes and textures. I was my first time having blowfish tail which was the size of a large prawn, with the texture of a white flaky fish. My favorite was the monkfish cheek though. It came with dollops of creamy tartar like sauce and some lemon. Overall, a superb dish.Finally, I ended with their signature maccheroni all chitarra with sea urchin and crabmeat ($26). They don't offer half pastas so you must get the full order. This dish was really wonderful. It was incredibly buttery, with a nice orange hue and tasted like the essence of the sea from the sea urchin. Not overpowering, but just enough. Pasta was cooked perfectly al dente. Portion size was very nice, but I only wish there was some more lumps of crabmeat throughout.Great service as usual from a Lidia establishment.

Given the hype surrounding this place, I would assume that I simply picked the wrong thing.... if my friends had not felt exactly the same about their dishes. Simply not worth it, without even accounting for how expensive the entrees are.Finally, our waiter was pretty rude and snarky with us, for no apparent reason (was he mad that we didn't get any wine? I am still not sure). On the whole Esca was a pretty forgettable experience, especially given how we were all looking forward to dinner there.",1,1,0,Ayushman G.,"Hoboken, NJ",135,15,0

From the maitre d' to the coat check girl to our waiter to the bread basket men, they were collectively attentive and congenial and attractive. When a business and their employees appear composed and minimalistic, it puts the customers at ease and draws the focus to the food...The buratta was cold, fresh and creamy yet perfectly balanced with the salty hackleback caviar. I'm salivating just thinking about this simple menu item that was a standout star during our dinner. The real thigh slapper was my meal. The swordfish, oh HAVE MERCY you tender, deliciously medium rare cooked delight with a crispy, melt-in-your-mouth-outside. This swordfish was unlike any other I have ever ever had. Just for my entre, I wanted to award Esca with a perfect 5. The reason why I'm deducting a star is because of the dessert. It was like a show without a finale!

5.0,1/19/2013,"2013 has been the year for 5 star restaurants, or maybe I'm just in a good mood. I chose this Mario Batali restaurant for a special dinner, and it met all of my expectations. It was beautiful, romantic, and featured excellent Italian dishes served with perfection. One really important thing to note though: This is a seafood only restaurant, and few options exist for non-seafood eaters. My date was stuck with eating spaghetti noodles and ignoring the luscious lobster meat around it. Of course, I took care of the lobster, which was a general portion at 1 lb. in the spaghetti with tomatoes and mint sauce.Our reservation was at 7:45, and it took us 45 minutes to get a seat. However, the host did exactly what great restaurants do. He invited us to the bar and bought us a free drink while we waited, and we were happy to wait for such a nice gesture.The service was attentive and excellent, and very accommodating. The servers were Italian and the ""real thing.""While not as expensive as other NYC restaurants, this place does exceed the prices in the neighborhood. The wine is a bit overpriced at $16 to 20 per glass, and thus I avoided it. They need to lower the price slightly. And the dinner entrees were around $30 to $35 each, making our dinner around $70 without wine. The dessert options were $12 to 15 each but looked amazing.Other than the price, this was one of the finest experiences I've had in a NYC restaurant in a while, and I recommend it for HK residents as well as theater goers.",2,0,2,Todd B.,"Midtown, Atlanta, GA",751,694,6

1.0,12/28/2012,"AVOID, AVOID, AVOID!Service is HORRENDOUS.  Waiter had a major, ""freaked out"" attitude apparently because he could not handle the pressure from a pre-theater crowd (which we were not, but the restaurant clearly preys upon).  The maitre d is a phony BS artist of the first order who Battali MUST love because he is ALL about moving tables and making money, and clueless about what a purported fine dining experience is about.  And what a shame because the chef cooked his ass off and presented a mostly decent meal.In short, when THEY decide your dinner is over, it's over.  Period. End of story.  We just returned from dinner there with close friends from out of town, and as is similarly the case with Battali's other (former?) restaurant, BaBo, the service is purely artificial, pretentious, and -- most of all -- classless. We were 5 people seated at a table of 6 who dropped over $600 in less than 2 hours, and immediately after serving us coffee but BEFORE bringing us dessert, the waiter brought over the check and asked if we could pay right there and then. I was annoyed, but politely and without complaint complied. But then -- at this point less than 2 1/2 hous into the entire meal -- the tall, humorless, clueless stiff posing as a maitre d approached us demanding that we leave because there was a group of 6 that just arrived waiting for the table who ""may spend $600 of their own, but won't know until they are seated.""Nice.  All class. I've eaten at some of the best Michelin restaurants in the world, and NEVER encountered this service-- even at restaurants that have more than one serving per table a night.  But to make my point even more relevant here:  I have also loved eating at local gastropubs and out of the way gems around the world, all of which were in far more need to ""turn tables"" than this place, and NEVER encountered such low-class service as what took place a few hours ago at Esca. Indeed, this deficiency of service must be standard policy at Battali restaurants:  several years ago, we encountered a roach walking across our FOOD at BaBo, and when we pointed it out to the equally pretentious maitre d there, he SAW THE ROACH, SQUASHED IT WITH A NAPKIN, APOLOGIZED, AND DID NOTHING ELSE. NADA. Get the picture here?  I can only assume that since this is now the second encounter with sloppy, unprofessional, greedy Battali service that perhaps the same can only be said about him as a person.  Shame on him (and his waiter/maitre d).  They know better, but just don't care.Neither will I, as I will never eat at a Battali establishment again.",9,2,0,Rey P.,"Verona, NJ",1,3,0

I ordered the 6 flight crudo - this was really interesting and each of the fish were prepared very differently. The sea urchin in shell was coolest to eat, but not necessarily my favorite. Great experience thoughMy friend ordered the grilled calamari. It was a full squid, on her plate. I'm more squeamish than she is so did not appreciate the black ink oozing out of her appetizer.

My appetizer to start was the white anchovies, which other than the Vino Nobile di Montepulciano,  was the highlight of the meal for me.  Hubby had the oysters which were fabulous.  When ordering our lunch, we offered or should I say sold on some additions to the menu which included white truffles with a thick pasta.  I went with that and another special of fusilli with shrimp.  The pasta I was sold on came out as a mushy angel hair not what was described to me.  The fusilli was also ok.  I felt as if I was constantly being sold.  If your food is good, do you really need to sell it?  My last note and a pet peeve of mine, again alluding to this sommelier, I felt was more like the wine warden.  Keeping the wine away from the table, having to wait for her to realize we needed more was quite irritating really.  I know places do this to make it more chic, but that does not impress me.  I don't think this will be a place I will frequent.",0,0,0,Janine W.,"Suffern, NY",307,450,333

Our waiter was friendly however being from Texas there isn't a lot of Restaurants like Esca so I wish the waiter would have explained the food more because the menu looked Greek. We ordered one appetizer and the waiter recommended us to split a pasta, so we did. Then he informs us that we didn't reach our table minimum? Yes, there is a house rule of a table minimum. We still haven't figured out what the minimum was but we were at $55 with appetizer and main course.  So there wasn't anything else we wanted so he recommended a salad evidently the salad reached the minimum. We split the main course so our portion was exactly 3-4 bites. we ordered Fettuccini with King Crab. Buttered noodles with cold crab is what we received.

They were very attentive and were all right there to fill our glasses, remove plates and ask if we needed anything. I would rate the service as excellent. While it was a little noisy as others have written, I didn't think it was to the extreme.  We started with the house wine which was very good and stayed with it through the meal. I recommend going that approach. It was a Nebbiolo blend and very good. We started with Maine Oysters and the Sea Trout splitting everything. I added lemon to the oysters and they shaved some horseradish off of a large root on top. They were amazing. The sea trout came out with some olive oil, citrus and a slight tinge of salt. The salt really enhanced the flavor. It also was tremendous. We also shared the squid ink pasta which was fantastic. It was small enough that we all got 2 or 3 bites.  This was the perfect amount. We also split the Branzino. They came out and flashed us what appeared to be our fish encased in a casket of salt. For all I knew it could have been plaster, but the effect was impressive. We had them clean it and bring out just the prepared fish. The flavor was also tremendous. Overall, I think this is a very impressive restaurant and one I very highly recommend.

1.0,12/12/2012,"From Bad To WorseThis is a Batali's Italian Seafood theme restaurant which our group was very eager to try having eaten at Babbo and Lupa multiple times.  If you've ever been to a Batali restaurant you expect a certain quality of food, level of service and atmosphere.  Unfortunately this is the exact opposite when it comes to Esca.  So many things went wrong.. 1. Upon entering the restaurant, we check in with the hostess and let her know there are 2 other people in our party of 4.  She lets us know they are over there (pointing at the small bar area) and urged us to check our coat multiple times as we looked for the rest of our party.  We didn't see them because they were already at the table.  Thanks for letting us know and taking us to our table.2. The waiter comes to talk about the menu and suddenly the volume in the restaurant is as loud as being in the 1st row of a Who concert. We can barely hear him as staff is flying by us as if we were in the middle of Times Square.3. We got an order of bread with this young olive oil which was really good, probably the best thing we ate all nite unfortunately.4. We get our apps and pasta.  The Yellow Fin Carpaccio looked as appetizing as a piece of fruit roll up on a plate and tasted just as bad (we sent it back).  The razor clams were good, but the portion was small for the price point.  The guitar cut pasta was super al dente that it was still raw because it was cold (maybe the kitchen forgot to warm it up). The squid ink pasta was tasty.  The scallops were good and the portion size made them shareable.5. On to dinner.. we waited about 30 minutes for the fish to come and the entire time our waiter was nowhere around.  The staff was buzzing around like it was 2 minutes before the closing bell at the stock exchange.  The fish arrives but still needs to be filleted and after 15 more minutes we have cold fillet fish to eat.  After hailing down our waiter we let him know the fish is cold and he offers to warm it up for us (I honestly thought it was a joke, but he was serious).  We all decline the offer as we imagine heat lamps with stacks of fish lined up like burgers at McDonalds.  Oh wait, I almost forgot that as they brought out the fillet fish plates they knocked over a full glass of water on my lap and phone!  Even my coat check ticket was soaked in my pocket.  I found 2 bones in my fish, another person at our table found a bone in their fish, and a 3rd person had so much oil on their plate that the fish was swimming in it (not good tasting).6. After all this happens, the manager comes out to apologize and asks if we would like a bottle of wine.  We declined as we were just about done.  He then offers desert which we also decline.  When the bill came, the dishes we had problems with were taken off along with 3 drinks.  They also brought a small plate of cookies which I wish I could say were good.  We paid $50/person (4 people) for bread with olive oil, apps, pasta, and 1 small fish.  To add insult to injury the cookies were stale, but they were complimentary.7. It got to the point that we were tired of complaining to only hear the staff say sorry, but nothing was done to correct the problems until the end which was a lot too late.  I wish I could say it ended there, but I seriously thought they lost my coat in a coat room the size of a bathroom.  The coat check girl was frantically looking for my coat that it caused a backup like people trying to get back into the city after Hurricane Sandy.  Needless to say, (but I will) we agreed - never  return to Esca.",3,0,0,Mr. T.,"Lomita, CA",0,5,0
1.0,12/11/2012,"We went to Esca excited to try another Batali restaurant.  Our expectations were pretty high, but not unreasonably so.  A restaurant at this price range and with this reputation does have a minimum level of service and quality to meet just to pass as fair, however, in this case, Esca failed miserably.  Summary: cold and inconsistent food, noisy, rushed service, poor customer service and management.Upon first entering, I noticed that the tables where a bit spaced together and the place just felt crowded.  Not overwhelmingly so, so I assumed it was an intentional part of the ambience.  We were promptly seated, but it took the waiter about 10 minutes to come to our table.  Once he did, he was pleasant and took our drink order while we waited for the rest of our party (4 total).  I ordered a Maker's Mark, which came promptly in a nicely full glass.  Once the rest of our party arrived we waited another 10 minutes or so for the waiter to finally come back and take their drink orders.  It took us a while to decide what to order, but once we finally did we had a hard time getting the waiter's attention.  Here is where it started to go downhill.  The service was slow.  The waiter difficult to understand.  Everyone working at the restaurant was running around bumping into each other.  They kept bumping us while they cleared our dishes.We ordered the freshly pressed olive oil to start, which I have to say was fantastic.  My Ceviche was delicious, however, we also ordered the Ahi tuna appetizer, which looked like it was thrown on an old cafeteria plate and tasted like cardboard.  It was inedible.  We also ordered three pastas, all came out cold.  The guitar cut pasta tasted like macaroni and cheese out of the box.  I'm sure the ink pasta would have been great had it been hot.  For the entree, three of us shared the blue fish.  20 minutes after they cleared our appetizers, someone came with the fish and apparently intended to show them to us prior to filleting... at least that's what we THINK he intended, because he just ran up to the table, mumbled something, spun around while balancing the fish and disappeared.  At this point we are assuming the fish was cooked.  Unfortunately, it took another 15 minutes for the filleted fish to return.  Cold. Our suspicions were correct; they had been cooked and must have sat around somewhere getting old during the filleting.  Again it would have been tasty had it been hot.  Well... except for my piece... it was DRENCHED in olive oil.  I took two bites and left the rest on the plate.  We addressed each issue as they came up with the waiter who apologized profusely, but really didn't seem to take any initiative to correct the situation. Except, surprisingly, with the Bluefish, where he offered to reheat it.  Yes, that is correct, he offered to reheat an $100 piece of fish.  We imagined they had a heat lamp and microwave in the back for just these situations.  After the Bluefish, the manager came by and offered us wine... um... we were DONE with dinner, but thanks for the thought.  Again, he apologized profusely.  We turned down the wine so he left and returned later to offer us dessert on the house.  At this point our question was: does this guy expect to offer us just dessert to make up for the lousy food and service?  We were ready to leave by then anyway, so we turned it down.  Finally we were given a cookie tray, which is apparently standard... stale, old tasting cookies that must have been stored in someone's basement during Sandy.  They did take off the Bluefish, Ahi and drinks from the bill.  We ended up paying $200 for a good olive oil and bread appetizer, a ceviche, a Maker's Mark, and a glass of wine.  Everything else was barely edible.  To top it all off, they temporarily lost one of our coats at the coat check... we couldn't get out of there fast enough and will not be returning.  Ever.Advice to the manager- work on improving how you deal with upset customers.  You had plenty of opportunities to correct the problem, but you didn't take any of them.",1,0,0,Sergio D.,"New York, NY",4,19,3

We were first sent a crostini with cannellini beans and olives. This was more or less an amuse bouche. The crudo followed: Sea Bass with pine nuts, Fluke with radish, a pristine oyster, hamachi, swordfish, and wonderful, perfect uni. I honestly could have just eaten round after round of crudo at this point. Next we had more crostini, this time with braised leaks and cured salmon roe. Salty and popping with that sea-brine deliciousness of the roe. Then a bitter salad with house-made breadcrumbs and anchovies. We both loved it. A pasta course followed: rustic shrimp ravioli with chanterelles, chestnuts, and pureed butternut squash. I am drooling obscenely even thinking about it. I could have very easily eaten multiple servings of this. Next up was a crispy hot striped bass with wild mushrooms and little pumpkin dumplings. Outstanding. A great finish.Before dessert we were served delicious dollops of ricotta dressed simply with honey. This combination cannot be improved upon.We were served two desserts: my wife had an apple tart with goat's milk gelato, and I had a flight of sorbetti. I was not especially moved by the sorbetti, but then, dessert is usually an afterthought for me.

1.0,11/19/2012,"If you have dietary restrictions, your business is not welcome at ESCA!  We have eaten here several times before, and thoroughly enjoyed the food and the service.  However, on a recent visit we went with our teenage daughter, who has serious dietary restrictions.  She is able to live with them at most restaurants by asking the restaurant to leave off certain ingredients and we have never had an issue with restaurants' willingness to accommodate her.  However, at ESCA the response from the waiter was that he would have to ""check with the chef"" and the chef's response was that he was not willing to make the dish without certain ingredients because it would ""compromise the integrity of the dish"".  Honestly, all we were asking for was a simple pasta dish without the sauces.  This was not only quite embarrassing for our daughter (it is bad enough to have to live with such a restricted diet) but really destroyed the atmosphere (her 16th birthday celebration!!) for the whole meal. Isn't there a happy medium somewhere between the sanctity of a chef's cuisine and the dietary restrictions of a child or any diner with special needs?? Totally turned us off!

5.0,11/18/2012,"Wow. Reading reviews on YELP for this restaurant is really an enlightening, and dare I say frightening, peek into the mind of other diners.  The truth is if you are complaining because you can't find 'bargains' on the menu, and because the waiter did not do an acceptable catch-and-release of a pigeon (twice?!), you're really not being fair to the establishment.  There are fine bottles of wine from $40 on the list, and pigeons have rabies which makes the catching of one with bare hands a praise-worthy accomplishment even if the bird returned.  I really don't understand the transition from ""a bird was on the patio outside"" to ""we should have got free stuff"".  Next up: it was windy but they didn't send us home in a limo.  Come on. The wine list is incredible. Almost as incredible as the sommelier, whose IQ is no less than156 and who can describe every liquid they have PLUS every liquid they don't have but which he will be kind enough to recommend to a fellow wine enthusiast. The crudo is amazing and while I claim to hate raw fish like conventional sushi, my mouth waters at the thought of the delightful creations and combinations they come up with weekly.  The service is great all around, and the people who work here respect food.  They also respect customers.  They never rush you out but if you are going to a show they will ensure you get on your way with time to spare. It is often painful to watch the tourists who somehow find this place, perhaps because it's not far enough from Times Square.  Esca should immediately stop accepting reservations through mediocre tourist hotels like the Sheraton T.S., they are sending people who are more trouble than they are worth. You will recognize these customers because of their Akron accents, elastic waist pants, and Magicuts hairstyles.  In one example, a couple ordered the briny clam pasta, then complain about the saltiness.  I actually heard the waiter tell a lady twice the dish was briny, only to have her complain when it came that the dish was over-salted. On another occasion a group of four cranky mid-western female tourists stared at me and my boyfriend for over an hour, casting disapproving glances, just sipping Coke and taking it all in as if it were a tour attraction. 99.99% of clients seem to be from NY and even more so at luch.  They only take reservations 30 days in advnce.",0,0,0,Vanessa L.,"Hutchinson, KS",0,12,0

We were sitting outside on the patio - which is lovely - when a rogue pigeon flew into the fountain and started splashing around. One of the waiters caught it and released it just outside of the patio area. It probably would have been smarter to release it a bit further away as the seemingly deranged/disoriented pigeon flew right back in and began swooping down around the people seated outside. It landed on my boyfriends head and I screamed in disgust. The waiter finally caught it again and this time took it further away. I would have thought that any upscale restaurant would have provided a complimentary glass of wine or dessert on the house after such a fiasco, but we received nothing to make up for the incident (perhaps because we did not actively complain about it to our waiter). The meal itself was quite good. We split one of the crudos, the ricotta gnocchi and the orata americana.

4.0,10/30/2012,"Esca is without peer in serving fresh seafood crudo in the most delightful ways. The daily fish are served with unique salts, oils, and herbs.

I think its one of the best in town. The Maccheroni alla Chittara, house-made guitar cut spaghetti, with crabmeat in a sea urchin sauce is a creamy dish rippling with the flavors of the sea.If you feel like you need a little kick, order the Squid Ink Spaghetti with cuttlefish, chilies and scallions.

The table wasn't ready for our 5:30 PM reservation (it's not like there was another four-top lingering over a meal that started at 4 PM - the restaurant just wasn't ready). When you use the restroom, a server insists on walking there with you. As if.We were asked when we were seated if we had an 8 PM curtain. We did, but it still took the staff two hours to grind through their self-indulgent rituals: serving the bread with tongs, ""washing"" the wine glasses with our selection, etc. Conversation during the interminable pauses between courses was a chore, because some twit on the staff thought early-'70's rock&roll on the sound system (and bad rock&roll at that) would enhance the dining experience. Begging the server to turn it down bought us 15 minutes of blessed relief, before somebody cranked it up again.Four diners, two appetizers, one bottle of wine, four mains (all either indifferent or tasteless), two desserts, and a round of coffees. $300, before the tip.

3.0,10/23/2012,"Sometimes I'm too lazy to write a review because I'm in such a food coma. this is one of those instances. Esca is for big eating. We are talking many courses of lots of italian based fish dishes. That means, oysters, then raw, then salads, then pasta, then a main course, then a dessert. Don't worry you don't have to do all of that, because one maincourse with their excellently prepared vegetable sides (try the fennel or kale.... mon dieu) is enough to feel like you need a fainting couch from the sheer filling quality of the food. It is not one of those ""light"" fish places. Expect to eat heavily. It has been a day and I still feel like I need a nap. The services is fantastic and some of the best I've had in the city. Very attentive, very kind, very on their game. Two managers stopped by during the course of the meal. It was almost overwhelming. The thing holding it back from 4 stars is honestly the price.

I enjoyed it so much, I planned to return and finally after 8 1/2 years, I've kept my vow.  I must say I was disappointed in almost every aspect of the experience.  The hostess did not great us very warmly, our server was inflexible and pretentious. The food portions were small and except for the Crudo (raw fish sampler), and the Verdura Mista (Beet salad with sheep's milk ricotta), unremarkable. For my secondi, I ordered the Zuppa di Pesce. While it did have a nice variety of fish and shell fish, there was something uninspired about the broth (dare I say...boring). If this was not a Mario Batali inspired restaurant, I would not expect so much. My wife ordered the Taglierini (House made spaghetti with mussels and a sauce made from squash and cheese). The Taglierini is another example of a dish that while sounding promising on the menu, did not fulfill expectations; it too was a bit bland and lacking passion. Our sever did little to guide us through the rather extensive menu and almost seemed bothered by our questions.The wine I ordered (at $20/250ml) was horrid; you will not find any bargains on the wine list! Desserts fared a bit better. I ordered the Affogato Di Cafe.

1.0,7/31/2012,Seriously disappointing.I've been to Esca a few times before this evening.  I've recommended Esca on a number of travel forums and I've recommended Esca to various senior leaders at work and to people traveling in for meetings.  My previous experiences were top notch but this evening was hugely disappointing.I think the server forgot to put the order in to the kitchen.  This wouldn't be a big issue for a 7:00PM or 7:30PM dinner but when you're dining after 9:00PM it is a bit more of an issue when you have meetings the next morning.After what was at least a full hour the server realized he'd screwed up and put in a rush order and refilled our wines.  The food was not fully cooked and was very disappointing.  I had recommended Esca to the friend I was dining with and explained it is a Mario Batali and Lydia B. collaboration and it is first class all the way.  This evening I think it was a step below what I might expect from a discount burger joint.We informed the manager about the disappointing entree and he simply sent complimentary dessert (nobody wanted any dessert) and never even apologized.  Two and a half hours to have a shared app. and individual entrees.  The server was gone for the evening before the entrees came out.  The manager obviously couldn't care less.  Just an extremely disappointing evening (and especially disappointing considering the generally very high levels of service at Mario and Lydia's restaurants).I hope the manager receives some retraining on dealing with customers in what is (or is at least supposed to be) a step above White Castle.,3,1,0,Matthew H.,"New York, NY",24,56,0

We absolutely love Italian and seafood, and obviously Esca has a great reputation for its crudo and other dishes.As usual, since it was our first visit we decided to go for the tasting menu with wine pairings. The crudo comes out first and was good but didn't blow me away. The presentation was nice and the olive oil they used was fantastic, but the fish/shellfish itself really didn't blow me away.The non-crudo dishes were all decent but nothing spectacular either. There was a razor clam dish, pasta with shellfish, and salmon filet. That's all I remember specifically. I'd eat it all again but wouldn't go back for anything in particular.So, three stars for the main dining experience (food, value, ambiance, service, etc.). Our waiter was apparently new and so there were a few hiccups related to that (coming back to ask questions he should've asked when we ordered), but that wasn't at all a big deal to us. The problem is that we both got SICK from our dinner, and that is of course a big problem! My wife got sick shortly after we got home that evening, and was very queasy the entire next day (even had to miss plans the next night), while I felt fine the night of but then woke up the next morning feeling nauseous.We really did have a wonderful time at Esca, so I can't knock it all the way down to one-star (I've never done that before!) but there was just nothing spectacular about the experience and the aftermath was obviously unacceptable.

We had seen Spiegelworld first, which is a whole other 5 star review being formulated, and stopped in here at around 9 on a Sunday evening. The place was packed. The Host was very gracious and gave us a fabulous table in the corner. The first thing we were served was the amuse bouche which was cannelloni beans served on toast...delish! I will have to admit that the bread they served next was really not a favorite of mine which was a bit disappointing as I'm a HUGE bread fan. Since it was so late and we weren't starving we decided to split a few things. To start we had the Insalata Di Granoturco which was fresh baby corn, chanterelles, walnuts and aged goat cheese, I don't know what they put in all their dishes but they're like crack. The corn was so fresh and sweet and the dressing just brought all the flavors together perfectly. We also had the Moscardino, Grilled Mediterranean baby octopus, roasted cippoline and local greens. The octopus was perfectly cooked and the roasted onions were so sweet. Another hit. For our main entree we chose to split the Scialatelle on the recommendation of our waiter. This was Amalfitana style flat pasta with gulf shrimp, fire roasted biker billy jalapenos and local corn. We were thinking, ""maybe too much corn for one evening?"" but it is at it's peak and he did not steer us wrong. There were a few succulent shrimp and the pasta was really interesting. Perfectly sauced of course. We had had a few cocktails at Spiegelworld so we didn't want to do an entire bottle of wine. We chose the Etna Rosato Terre Nere 2010 Rosato by the quartino to start and then moved on to a quartino of Chiaranda Donnafugata 2007.

Maybe it was just where we were seated, but there was absolutely no warmth, ambiance or even a shred of privacy, which you would hope for when shelling out that much for a meal.The food was quite tasty. But one tiny piece of octopus in an $18 appetizer is pretty much inexcusable, even at Esca. Also, my pasta (linguini with little gem clams) was slightly undercooked. Also inexcusable, especially at Esca.The service was impersonal and a bit unfriendly. They took our wine glasses away before we'd even finished our bottle, which they kept out of sight from our table. Had to ask the waiter if there was any left.. He wasn't very apologetic when he recovered the wine and, as we suspected, there was about 1/5 of the bottle remaining. Also snooty and pretentious, which is not the worst thing in the world. Except that I'm not Italian, so if I read a menu item in English, I should be able to get away with it. Example: Me: What are your flavors of sorbet tonight? Waiter: ""Sorbetti? Well, we have...""I don't think the waiter was Italian, either.I'm not going to run back to Esca because, for the price point, it was missing a lot of finishing touches. It sucks, because they are clearly resting on their laurels... and catering largely to the tourist / theater district crowd.",1,1,1,Kristin M.,"Manhattan, NY",1,19,0
5.0,5/8/2012,"This is one of the restaurants I will remember for a very long time thanks to the best gnocchi I've ever had in my life. Esca's version is made from ricotta, buffalo mozzarella and the freshest, most vibrant tomato sauce known to woman and man. It literally melted in my mouth, and then melted again. The Italian sushi topped with fancy salts was a creative, tasty starter. Service was outstanding on all fronts, particularly from the dry-witted sommelier was quite entertaining. He helped us choose the perfect Italian wine for our meal and made our dinner even more memorable. Or table adjacent to the deboning station may have put off some, but we had fun watching the waitstaff display skills we'll never have. The people-watching late on a weeknight was true NYC and amped up the enjoyment even further.",1,0,1,Jayne D.,"Chicago, IL",0,92,3
4.0,5/7/2012,"(This is part one of the review. See the update for part two)For my Birthday dinner, I was asked where I wanted to go to dinner. Not having an opinion, I allowed the host of the occasion to choose, whereupon she chose Esca. After reading the yelp reviews, I was a little worried, but figured we would give it a try. My advice: Don't be worried.A couple quick tips for this place, and then full review below.* EAT EARLY! Service is pretty slow, and when we were leaving at 7:30 the kitchen was out of lots of items.* The restaurant can get very noisy when it is busy. See above.* The server will recommend some fish that are fresh that day. Order them.* Don't worry about the price. You saw it on the menu before you ordered, so sit back, treat yourself, and have a good time.Full ReviewArriving at Esca at 5:15 for our reservation, our table was ready immediately, and we proceeded to our table, where we ordered drinks and waited for the rest of our party to arrive. When they did, we were brought menus, as well as the amuse bouche, which was crostini with fava beans, which was delicious. As we persued the menu, our waitress arrived to give some suggestions about the fresh fish, and what was fresh that day. After we perused the menu, with much deliberation, we were ready to order.The FoodAfter we ordered, the bread man came quickly, offering up two excellent choices, classic Italian or whole wheat foccacia. Paired with their tangy olive oil, it was an excellent hold me over until the appetizers arrived. One member of our party ordered oysters in addition to the appetizer, and they were brought ASAP, while we were enjoying drinks and bread, so the hot apps could come out all together. When the apps arrived after a bit of a wait, we dug right in.Appetizers6 oysters on the half shell (6@3.50-21.00)-Did not have them, but a member of our party said they were very fresh. 9/10 Vongole(2x @$18) Baked local littleneck clams with prosciutto San Danielle and cherry bomb peppersTwo members of our party had this, and they gave it a very good review. I got a taste of the sauce, which was buttery, lemony, and had a hint of heat. 9/10Mazzancole($19)  Grilled Florida white shrimp with prosecco vinaigretteGood shrimp once you could get to them, however, they were completely in the shell, heads included, so it was somewhat difficult to eat. Also the most overpriced dish we had at $19 for 3 shrimp. 6.5/10Polipo ($17) Grilled octopus with giant corona beans and preserved sorrento lemon.Recommended by the waitress as one of the fresh fish of the night, I had this for my app, which was excellently cooked, with a little mustard like glaze, on top of cabbage, beans, and a hint of lemon. The flavors of this dish worked very well. Only con was not a lot of octopus and a lot of beans. 9.3/10EntreesMoving on to entrees, again after a bit of a wait, our entrees came out. Here's what we had.(only the first description is from the menu, the others were specials for the evening)Sogliola Per Due ($72) Whole roasted local flounder for two with hazelnuts, almonds, pine nuts and sorrel. Nicely roasted, had a good flavor, however, I think it could have used a little sauce to make it more exciting. The nuts were on the side and really did not add much to the dish. The fish had a nice skin, and was well cooked. 8.5/10Roasted cod(2@$37).  with salad of mushrooms and fennel Two members of our party, myself included, had this dish, which was excellent. Perfectly cooked, fresh fish, with a crispy baked top, and the mushrooms that accompanied this dish were perfectly cooked, with a sweet, tender sauce. Only negative was that there was not enough sauce for the fish. 9.7/10Squid ink fuselli($27?)  with mussels, clams, scallops and shrimp. WOW! This dish was ordered by the last member of our party, who graciously gave me a taste. Perfect pasta, a delicious squid ink sauce, and plenty of delicious fresh seafood. Overall an excellent dish, and tied with the cod for best dishes of the night. 9.7/10DessertsWe were getting pretty full by this point, so some of our party decided to sit out dessert. We ordered two desserts, which were both well received.Budino Di Banana($12) Banana pudding with peanut brittle and salted Carmel sauceI split this with someone else in our party, and the portion was large enough to share. It was a creamy banana custard, ontop of the peanut brittle and some sort of cake. They wrote happy birthday on the plate, which was very nice. An excellent dessert over all. 9/10Affogato di Caffe($12) Sweet cream gelato and amaro croquante drowned in espresso Did not have this, but the person that did said it was good. 8/10(CONTINUED ON THE NEXT REVIEW)",1,0,0,George H.,"Boston, MA",0,47,0
3.0,4/25/2012,"The crudo, raw fish, had too much salt and olive oil, if I wanted salt and olive oil I could have stuck with the bread. Pasta mediocre.

2.0,4/21/2012,"What a disappointment! I came for a early dinner with sister and best buddy - all of us in NYC at the same time for the first time. The only good thing was that after a short wait we got to sit on the outdoor patio - without a reservation. Then my meal went downhill.I ordered the linguine - it came with pancetta and clams. But what no one explained what that the linguine was cooked in a signature style. I was told using sea water, i.e. salty water. Add the pancetta and you get more salt than is healthy or tasty. I asked the waiter - Jimmy - why it was so salty expecting him to return it to the kitchen. Instead he replied that it was meant to be that way. Hmmm. Well, if I don't like it I should be asked if I want to return for something else, but was never asked. So plan B. I spot the manager and again ask why the linguine was so salty. Then the sea water explanation was given. Oh...so the chef is right and I'm wrong. I left the dish, but was still charged a handsome $24 for it.This meal totaled $175+ tip and was just ok. All four, Porcini, Salmerino, Contorni, Rubararo.I just found the receipt and had to Yelp about this place. I can't believe I tipped the full amount. Man, what a fool!

5.0,3/26/2012,"Willing to spend some $$ for an amazing seafood adventure? Esca is where you should go. For real. No joke.We sat down (make reservations!) and were served a complimentary appetizer crostini and olives. Then we got some fresh bread with olive oil.They have an entire crudo menu (which is like, Italian sashimi) which you should never miss out on. Get the tasting plate, its 2 flights of 3 different kinds of crudo. Amazingly simple and so fresh I don't think your tastebuds will believe it. I didn't. In our two flights, we had a black clam, razor clam ceviche, 4 different types of fish. All of it was amazing. Simply seasoned with a little sea salt and olive oil or with some lime, beet juice...it was perfection.In my group, we ordered the squid ink spaghetti which was way too flavorful to be real! It was so good but beware, it's a spicy one. I got the pasta with sea urchin sauce + crab -- I wish I'd gotten a portion 3 times the size it was soo good. It was rich and creamy but not too much either. Then a seared scallop entree which was amazing the same way. We ordered an $80 bottle of sauv blanc so that made our check for four people total up to $91each (after tip). I would say it was worth it.

Instead of trying to help or saying something along the lines of, ""Sorry about the mix up, please go to the bar, get something to drink, and we will try to have a table ready as soon as possible (even if it would be 30 min or more)"" they came with a holier-than-thou attitude. Not only was the GM rude - his name was Chris and refused to give us his last name - but he came about with an arrogant attitude and basically told us, ""Good luck, there's nothing we can do or will do about it, if you want to eat here, wait at least 45 minutes, otherwise, as you can see, we don't need your business.""

5.0,3/9/2012,"They walked me to the bathroom....service is that good. I was really impressed with how great this restaurant was. Mario Batali's restaurants aren't really 5 stars but this one was outstanding. From the food to the service, everything was just perfect. We had a large group and ended up having to sit in separate tables. That is pretty bad for such a popular restaurant, but that was the only hiccup so I'm not going to dwell on that point. Our waiter was fabulous. He gave his honest opinion (so it seemed) and really knew the menu inside and out. One thing that bothered me though was that he kept saying ""he"" in reference to Batali as if ""he"" was the one in the kitchen.Onto the more important stuff, the food. We had a lot of it. We had the 6 plate sampler crudo, caprese, squid ink pasta and the goat milk pasta for appetizers. They are all about sharing and were able to split the pastas into equal portions for the table.The crudo was so fresh and so tasty. By far my favorite appetizer. The squid ink pasta was my second favorite. It was cooked with some peppers and while I'm not a huge fan of it, it was delicious. It was super flavorful with a nice little kick to set it apart from all the other squid ink pasta's I've had. For my entree I had the swordfish and it was out of this world! The rest of my table got the scallops and I was able to try that as well and it was perfection! Everything was cooked so well and super flavorful. The dishes here really stand out. The chef puts an extreme amount of care into preparing each meal and everything really is perfect. The service really was outstanding. I put a high value on service and based on that alone I will come back here. Our plates came out perfectly timed and we were never swamped with too many dishes on our table. I'm surprised reviews aren't higher for this place but it really was a great meal. I highly recommend this place if you're looking for someone nice for a special occasion.

3.0,3/5/2012,"Sleek elegance tucked away in Hell's Kitchen.  Loved the ambiance and presentation, a mixed bag on the food itself.  The amuse bouche was some sort of fish mixture on top of a toasted baguette slice.  It was really fishy.  I shouldn't complain about free, but it wasn't the greatest way to start off the meal and get my taste buds going.Crudo:  We started off with the razor clams ceviche and the Santa Barbara sea urchin.  The razor clams ceviche was excellent!  Served in their own shell atop a mound of crushed ice. The raw jalepenos added just the right amount of kick, and the acidity was pefect!  The Santa Barbara sea urchin was presented in its purple, thorny shell.  So cute!  Unfortunately, the urchin itself had a super bitter aftertaste.  Disappointing.  We were both not fans.Primi consisted of the Maccheroni Alla Chitarra: House made al dente spaghetti with sea urchin and crabmeat.  Very subtle dish, and just the right portion to share.  Secondi, we ordered the branzino for two.  They presented us with the sea bass cooked in the sea salt crust before they filet it open.  The fish was so sweet and full of flavor.Side order of broccoli rape:  Garlic-y and cooked perfectly.  Yum!  For dessert, we had the frittelle (pineapple fritters with rum toffee sauce).  Honestly, I was so buzzed by the time I had this, I don't remember much except that we finished them off.  Must have been good!Service, of course, was awesome.   The presentation was amazing.   Overall, I enjoyed my dining experience here.  3.5 stars.",1,0,1,Sandee L.,"Discovery Bay, CA",235,494,105
5.0,2/27/2012,"Two friends were in town visiting from Seattle and they were wearing suits when they got off the plane, so we decided to meet up at Esca for a drink. The bar is really small, and though we arrived at 5:30 when they opened, we were the second group there to have the idea to sit at the bar. They found us an extra chair and the three of us crammed in at the bar for cocktails and appetizers. First, the bartender was really fantastic. The kind of bartender who enjoys his work, takes pride in what he does and genuinely wants your experience to be wonderful. He was incredibly intuitive and anticipatory. He knew what we needed before we knew. And he knew how to pour a cocktail.I had the pomegranate Bellini and the boys ordered Manhattans. Bellini. Was. Perfect.We weren't planning on eating there, but once we saw the menu, we had to order something. We decided to sample some of the crudo and ordered the Hamachi, Nantucket Bay Scallops and this flattened fresh tuna thing with scallions. I don't recall what it was called, but I've heard it is not on the menu consistently.The Hamachi was good. It was really fresh and the cuts were great. If this was the only thing I had, the review would get 4 stars.The Tuna thing was really good. It was so thin - almost like a tuna Fruit Roll-Up. slightly oiled and sprinkled with scallions. Really fresh and perfectly made.Then I tried the scallops. We debated ordering them because I'm not a huge fan of scallops, but I'm so glad we did. I've never had scallops so good. We were rotating the dishes between the three of us, and we were legitimately fighting to keep this plate. So fresh, perfectly seasoned and oiled. Light, delightful, full of flavor. I have disliked scallops since 2003, and this dish turned it all around.We were on such a roll from the appetizers that we decided we also needed to get dessert. Ben ordered the salted caramel gelati and I picked the chocolate mint (Bartender pitched it as a Girl Scout Cookie 'Thin Mint'). Kevin wanted the apple cake/pie thing, so we got that too.  The Thin mint ice cream was pretty good and definitely tasted like a light version of the cookie. The Salted Caramel ice cream was amazing. We ordered 2 scoops, and spent our time fighting it out. The apple cake was really good.The food was amazing - add to that the superb service we received at the bar, and there's no way to deny that this place is 5 star.",2,1,2,Kate J.,"Manhattan, NY",12,15,1
4.0,2/23/2012,"A star-studded line up of chefs behind the scene does not always mean a good meal. But at Esca, Mario Batali partners with Joe Bastianich and Dave Pasternack who The New York Times has dubbed, a ""fish whisperer."" Inevitably, the result is a great example of upscale seafood rectitude.It was here that I had my first taste of crudo, an Italian take on serving raw fish. Akin to ceviche, much of the fresh fish is seasoned with simple spices or citrus-based ingredients.Reminiscent of conventional street seafood, the French Fries of the Sea (little silver fish rendered crisp) are a great starter to share.Most notable is the Maccheroni Alla Chittara; a homemade guitar cut pasta with sea urchin, crab, and green onion. Comparable to caviar but rendered luxuriously by way of brine and olive oil, this dish is simple, hearty, and sophisticated.Desserts are not a concession here. Putting any Starbucks' frappuccino affogato style to shame, Esca's Affogato Di Gelato is worth every caloric hike. Think vanilla gelato and mascarpone, doused with brawny shot of espresso.",1,0,0,Faris H.,"New York, NY",7,55,0
4.0,2/16/2012,"I'm a seafood lover, and Esca is a seafood lover's restaurant. The room is an open, simple, lovely space which makes not-so-lovely location on west 43rd Street. The service was excellent.  But, when it comes down to it, it's all about the fish, which is prepared, cooked and plated gorgeously. The oysters are a delight (east coast only on the menu but some west coast specials).  The crudo selection is magnificent - the bay scallops, razor clams, cannot be beat.  Got the crudo tasting - they choose 6 tastes for you that come out in 2 courses, really amazing for raw lovers.The pastas are extraordinary, but that lobster spaghetti! Damn, now that is a plate of pasta! The mint and the chilis take it to the next level. The whole Mediterranean sea bass (branzino) is salt baked and can be served filleted.  It is phenomenal.  Perfectly cooked, extremely fresh fish.  Last time I was there was white truffle season, so my date and I went all out and got the extravagant truffle pairing with the fish. While it was delicious, I would not recommend this as the fish was so flavorful and robust that the earthy truffles were lost on it, and not worth the $100 supplement. If I were to do it again, I'd get the truffle pasta special, and allow the fish to shine on its own.

And while the price is steep... this is the type of place that makes you realize that sometimes money does make food taste better.The food: Everyone at my table of four licked with appetizer, entree and dessert plates CLEAN. Seriously, some of the absolute best fish dishes. They were creative, unique, simple yet complex, elegant yet bold... just truly tasty. I got the grilled octopus salad with beans and it was one of the greatest things I have ever eaten - I would go back just for this dish. The beans were mixed in with some cabbagey vegetable and had a salty kick paired with their own natural creaminess. And with some perfectly cooked grilled octopus on top?? AMAZE. For din, I got the monkfish with mushrooms and leeks. The mushroom side was so earthy and deep tasty, while the monkfish was cooked to perfection. Other table highlights included the gnocchi for non-fish lovers, the sea urchin pasta, and the mushroom salad. And to finish off a spectacular meal?? THE AFFOGATO. This is a MUST order. Esca's homemade gelato, sprinked with toffee bits, topped in chocolate mousse, and then doused in espresso. YES.The Location: Definitely a fancy feel. Yet, while the ""classy, I feel like I should be dressed up appropriately"" vibe is strong, it never gets stuffy or in your face. The Service: Very attentive. I felt like I had 7 people waiting on me at once... one taking my order, one filling up my glass, one wiping the crumbs off my lap - they are kind, knowledgeable and on their game. The Price: ouch... this is where Esca hurts. Let's just say that you better be prepared to shell out the big bucks to eat here. But like I said...

2.0,2/1/2012,"I've been to Esca many, many times since my first 5 star experience. I've come to love all their delicious appetizers, pastas, and entrees. The holier than thou attitude of the wait staff is something you learn to love - and maybe, just maybe, given how good the food is, it's warranted. Based on this and the fact that it's the fiancés favorite restaurant, I decided to have our post engagement dinner at Esca. I told the hostess when I was reserving the table that I'd be taking my fiancé there directly after the proposal. She was excited. I figured that meant they'd make it a great experience for us. When we arrived there was no indication they knew who we were or what we were there for. We were seated promptly and ordered our dinner. Good dinner, as was to be expected. Then came the desert. We ordered the apple desert - their fancy version of the apple pie - and my new fiancé really wanted some vanilla ice cream to go with it. Upon this request, the waiter told us that ""they normally don't do this"" but he'd try. Normally don't pair ice cream with apple pie? Ok... fine. He came back and said the pastry chef would not do it. They needed to ""maintain the integrity of the desert"". Hearing this, I was pretty shocked. This pastry chef would deign to ignore the request of the customer hiding behind the notion that the integrity of the desert would be hampered by this pairing? I mean, maybe if I was telling them I wanted orange sorbet with the apple dish, I could get it. Maybe. You'd still have to ignore most of the tenets of customer service but that at least would make sense from a culinary perspective. But we're talking about vanilla ice cream and apple pie here people. I told the waiter that we had just gotten engaged and that I had chosen Esca because I wanted the day to be perfect for my fiancé, and to please ask and see if there was anything else he could do. He acquiesced. To be fair, he was a great server and I don't fault him for this at all. After a few minutes he came back and said that the pastry chef would be willing to do it, but they'd have to charge us for the scoop of ice cream. Well of course! Nobody was asking for free food here, just adding  a scoop of ice cream. But wait, I thought this was about the pastry chef's culinary integrity? Are you saying that for the right price, the pastry chef's culinary integrity could be bought? What price would be high enough to warrant such a thing? How much would it possibly cost to go against all of that pastry chef's culinary tenets and get her to place a scoop of vanilla ice cream on a piece of fancy apple pie in some sort of vile, amateurish, culinary orgy of imperfect flavor pairings?

In my life, every day is a special occasion - I can always find a good reason to eat good food.The first time I went here was for lunch with my mom. The second was dinner with my boyfriend.We ordered:Antipasti - Fall salad - Wasn't too crazy about it, not sure if it is offered now because it was seasonal. Had some fall vegetables. Raw scallops - Fucking yum. So delicious and fresh. The taste was outstanding.Paste - (very hearty portions, in my opinion, huge; but I'm not complaining!)Linguine with briny mahogany clams, hot red pepper and pancetta - My boyfriend ordered this and loved it. The waiter warned of it being a bit salty. Some may say that it is too salty, but he liked it. Saltier than the linguine with clams and pancetta at Babbo. Depends on your palate if you think it's too much, I guess.Spaghetti with one pound lobster - Divine. ONE POUND LOBSTER. That says enough. Falls out of the shell. Delicious. With a red sauce. Pasta with lamb ragu - My mother ordered this. She really liked it, it was the special of the day. HOWEVER, Esca is know for its fish, so I wouldn't order a meat dish here. No point, in my opinion, unless you're a regular and have ordered it all.Dolci - Bomboloni with lemon curd - Really delicious. Served with a huckleberry sauce for dipping. Sugary on the outside. Creamy goodness on the inside. Wish I could always have these at my dispense.Affogato di Caffe - My boyfriend forgot the rest of the world existed at this point. It was just him and his affogato. But that's ok, because at that point, it was just me and my dessert, the mela sottosopra. Mela Sottosopra - Devoured it.I also had a concord grape bellini.

Service was below average, albeit not quite offensively so.Our waiter took forever to get anything done, and disappeared for 10-15 mins at times.Although the décor is pleasant, the dining environment is a tad cramped & acoustic are higher than normal.Dining environment isn't optimally comfortable.Given the poor circumstances, Esca is one of few restaurants where I feel justified to take off a star for non-food issues.  It's always a shame that such good cooking is marred by management issues.  Some of the more negative Yelp reviews, in this regard, I feel are fairly justified.Hopefully they will improve in time, and I look forward to returning in a couple of months.Detailed review will look further into individual dishes.***Detailed Review  'Zuppa di Pesce Amalfitana'Fish soup in the style of amalfi with tomato chili bruschetta ($16)(Dish Rating 72%)yelp.com/biz_photos/6_Qd…Good rustic fish soup overall.  A good amount of olive oil is poured into the soup right before serving it, giving the soup a more oily consistency, but without being heavy or over-done.  The tomato based   broth is light but doesn't lack in flavor, and nor is harshly acidic.  Temperature of the soup is acceptably hot, although I feel it would benefit perhaps if temperatures were even higher.  Tender, generous pieces of white fish were used (unfortunately forgot to inquire the specifics).  Fish was tasty and moist, working with the broth very well.  A piece of toasted bruschetta was placed in the center and worked nicely.  Although flavor of the soup was delicious, I felt this was a bit simple and otherwise indistinct.  I enjoyed it very much, but doubt it will be memorable a few weeks from now.  It was more of a hearty, satisfying soup with good execution, but that alone, I feel is insufficient to make a great dish.   'Cuore'Seared Nantucket bay scallops with early winter citrus  $20(Dish Rating 92%)My gf ordered a seared Nantucket Bay scallop dish, and left me only a single meager piece.  The approach of the scallop was also quite straightforward, albeit they were cooked just right.  The ends had a prominent sear, while the interior had was closer to rare at parts, and resembled a very tender marsh mellow-like center closer to the interior.  I felt the execution was top notch and much more impressive than my soup.  Focus of the preparation centered on the scallop and delivered well.  It's not fair for me to rate this dish given my very limited exposure, but nonetheless I was highly impressed.Review continued, please refer to 'earlier review'",4,1,3,Adrian Robert H.,"Beverly Hills, CA",720,350,1747

1.0,9/12/2011,"Esca has been on my list of places to eat for years and years.  So when I say that I went into this dinner planning on loving the food, you know I'm not making it up.  My first surprise was the atmosphere.  I've read reviews saying it was loud so I expected a lot of chatter or dishes clanking.  I did not expect loud music.  Especially not Hendrix, Led Zeppelin, etc.  I love classic rock but I don't expect it blaring during a fine dining experience.  We asked them to turn down the music, which they did, but it was still a strange choice.  The biggest surprise was the quality of the food. Honestly, it was not good.  And I mean really not good.  As in I haven't had that bad a meal in a long, long time.  And this doesn't take into account the fact that dinner for two with one drink each was $250.  I have no problem paying for food if it's worth it.  This wasn't.  The meal started off ok but went downhill as we went along: - amuse bouche: a white bean fish bruschetta- very fishy and salty- crudo: the highly recommended scorpionfish is no longer available.  We had the hamachi with gaeta aioli (quite good!) and another fish (can't remember type) that was served  I can't remember with a black olive tapenade.  The black olives overwhelmed the fish which was nothing to write home about already.- salad: roasted corn salad.  Probably the highlight of the meal although definitely salty and nothing special.- pasta: spaghetti neri, pasta with cuttlefish.  Probably the most disappointing dish it was ridiculously almost inedibly salty.  There was little cuttlefish and the flavor was one dimensional.  Yuck.- fish: Branzino cooked in salt. We ordered it for two.  It was far larger than we needed it to be, I'd recommend ordering it for one and splitting.  Fish was salty like everything else.- vegetables:  can't mess these up, right?  I swear the broccoli were frozen broccoli florets.   And the eggplant was oily and flavorless.  Roasted potatoes were pretty good.And the final straw was my trip to the restroom....the hallway you need to navigate to get to the restroom is where they stack all the extra chairs.  This leaves the hall narrow and difficult to walk through (I bumped my knee on a chair leg).  I wondered what they do when they have a handicapped guest.",2,0,0,E R.,"New York, NY",0,3,0

2.0,9/6/2011,"We had high expectations of Mario Batalli's seafood restaurant in NYC. Sadly, we were a bit disappointed. Don't get me wrong: it wasn't the worst meal we've had, but when you spend that much money on a meal, you need it to be great. This was anything but ""great"". To start.... I had called to see if there was a bar to sit at prior to our reservation. The answer was yes, but what no one told me was that it is tiny and only has about 6 seats, if that. If you can't get a seat, you are stuck standing in front of the kitchen door, feeling very in-the-way. Minor issue, but should be noted if you like to have a drink at the bar before a big meal. Next was the food. We went for the tasting menu with the extra crudo supplement. The crudo arrived and we felt like we were in a fish market. It just wreaked. Fish shouldn't smell that overwhelmingly fishy, even raw. This made it difficult to eat. Next, the crudo came with razor clam mixed with some form of bell pepper. I had mentioned my bell pepper allergy on the Open Table reservation as well to my waiter when I was seated. I was assured the kitchen was aware. I bet you can guess what happened.... My crudo of razor clam was full of peppers! Thankfully, I didn't assume it was tomato and returned it to the kitchen. Considering they nearly killed me, you'd think they'd offer us a free glass of wine or no charge for the crudo. Nope, didn't happen. Eventually, the rest of the tasting menu starts to arrive. There was Arctic Char in two more courses. Really, 3 times in ONE tasting menu (2 times for my husband who got the clam)?  We ended up leaving before the last entree course of the tasting menu. We were a bit full, but honestly we just didn't want anymore of their fish and didn't feel like waiting for desert. The waiter did offer to pack up the last two courses for us, which we appreciated. And in the interest of full disclosure, the last two courses were great left over the next day. The last entree course was a lemon fish, which was to die for. The deserts of chocolate mousse and cheesecake were quite good too. It's just a shame that the rest of the meal was so underwhelming. The service was very good, but that can't make up for mediocre food.

They start you with an amuse of cannellini beans on crusty bread which is heavenly as well as a small dish of olives, and crusty bread or foccacia with olive oil.  My husband generally doesn't eat beans but he scarfs up the amuse as soon as it hits the table.I love to start with the crudo, which are fresh and flavorful, though the sardines are also delicious so it's a hard choice at times.  In the evening my husband and I will often split the salt-baked branzino, which is exceptional and in our opinion the best dish on the menu.  Moist, tender and full of flavor.  We can never choose from among all the delicious contorni, so we usually get a mix of all of them, which vary and can include broccoli rabe, beets, potatoes, leeks and more.  We're big fish eaters, so we rarely have pasta, though on occasion we will split the gnocchi as a primi.  It's the essential gnocchi, light as air and melt-in-your-mouth delicious.The wine list is extraordinary.  I usally don't recognize most of the selections, which focus on Italian offerings. Fortunately their staff are well versed to recommend the perfect wine to accompany your meal.Desserts are divine and the espresso is very good. When they have coffee gelato my husband is in heaven.  After writing this, I want to make a reservation soon!",1,0,0,Barbara M.,"New York, NY",8,87,0

4.0,8/16/2011,Great food and very friendly service.  I had the scallops as an appetizer which were AMAZING!!!!  And to top it off I had the sea bass which was also amazing and expertly done.  The waiters bring the salt encrusted sea bass to a serving station in front of you while they crack through to the delicious fish inside.  I would definitely recommend the bass if you order nothing else.,1,0,0,Cat L.,"Brooklyn, NY",9,17,10
2.0,7/26/2011,"I've been to Esca a few times, and I have to say that every time I've been, it's been disappointing.  New York City is, in fact, the land of opportunity- the opportunity to blow all your money on fancy meals because there are so many awesome and expensive restaurants out there.  Esca could be one of those, but it's just not.  That's not to say that there aren't redeeming qualities about it.  For example, I think that the time and care they take with fileting and de-boning a whole fish are unparalleled.  They have a great wine list.  They are great about honoring and seating your reservation on time.  These are all things that restaurants SHOULD do though.The places where Esca falls flat are on their quality of food, prices, food presentation, and portion size.  I've definitely paid top dollar for small portions before, so don't get me wrong here- I get the concept of an upscale restaurant, but if that's what Esca is trying to do here, then they are missing a few key elements that really get them up there.  First of all, if I'm paying top dollar for my dinner, I want the food to be of unmistakably good quality.  I don't get that from Esca.  The ""heirloom summer melon"" salad with ""she crab vinagrette"" is soggy watermelon slices, cut unevenly, with really fishy (and not in the fresh tasting way) lumpy sauce on top.  Don't order that salad. I've tried the blossoms, which, comically enough, come on a HUGE plate with TWO blossoms.  Are you serious?  If you're going to give me two of anything, but it on a reasonable (read: smaller) plate so that it's not so obvious to me that I just paid almost $20 for two flowers.  Octopus here is good and is probably one of the better quality appetizer dishes.  Also, the crudos are all good.  If you get the tasting, expect one bite per each item.  After all, it is a ""tasting.""We ordered a few pastas and they were good, but not great.  The sea urchin pasta is extremely rich and, in my opinion, over-salted.  The lobster pasta was good with a sizable portion of lobster.  If anything, at least the pasta itself was cooked perfectly to al dente.  Service was fine, but not enough to qualify the restaurant as upscale.  There's no dress code so next to my $20 for 2 flower blossoms, the average joe is there in torn jeans and flip flops. The space was loud and a bit cramped.  In any case, if you do come here, don't mess around and just get the prix fixe and be done with it.  It's the better deal in the end and at least you'll leave full.  Either way, I probably won't be coming back.",7,2,1,Rachel K.,"Queens, NY",150,248,13
5.0,7/20/2011,"**This review is for restaurant week lunch.**I made the reservation for lunch the day before on opentable.com and had no trouble getting a table. On their website it said the restaurant week menu changes daily and I was under the impression maybe we wouldn't have options but we got to choose between a couple different dishes for the app and main course.First they brought out an amuse bouche, which was maybe my favorite part of the meal. I think it was yellowtail with beans and onions on some toasted bread... it was a perfect combination of flavors and refreshing.I started with the crudo which was so tender and delicious. I loved the salt sprinkled on top of the fish.For my entree I had spaghetti with crab sauce. So nice to eat homemade spaghetti when I hadn't had it in a while, and the crab sauce was sweet without being too sweet and had lots of shredded crab meat. My friends and I loved it. Their mackerel entrees were really big for restaurant week - big filets of fish that were almost like steak and totally delicious.For dessert we all had berry shortcake with cheese... also amazing. A mint sauce around the edges of the dish made it that much better.Our server was so helpful and charming without pushing anything on us.

3.0,7/12/2011,"From both outside and inside, the restaurant is pretty -  bold, airy, but intimate - great for a dressed up occasion as well as a relaxed and casual affair.  The website advises business casual, but smart casual is definitely fine.The food was a bit surprising and definitely interesting - intentionally ambiguous as those words are.  First, don't come here expecting Italian as you may know it a la Carmine's or Little Italy.  The only tomato sauce on the menu came with four little tuna meatballs - tender but surprisingly fishy.  Also don't expect an antipasto salad to start.  Instead, try the warm sweet corn salad with shaved cheese and sauteed morel mushrooms.  This was probably the highlight of the evening - sweet, sharp, and fragrant.  The ""BLT"" rigatoni was very interesting, dressed ever so lightly with some cured tuna belly (bacon), specs of arugula (lettuce), and sun cured tomato.  The pasta was cooked well, but because it was so lightly dressed and the BLT was so sparingly added, it was difficult to get a flavorful bite of pasta each time.  Our cod with lima beans was bland and incredibly forgettable as was the mixed seafood fry (though very authentically Italian).  I can't remember what we got for dessert, so apparently that was forgettable too.  I do remember enjoying it, as a welcomed respite from the barrage of all foods surprising and interesting.  Unlike the other reviewers, I didn't take offense with the wait staff.  They seemed professional and knowledgeable about the food and their preparation.  All in all, do not come here with preconceptions in tow.  You will not find spaghetti and meatballs here, try as I did to accommodate some less than adventurous guests.  Go with an open mind and some money to spend because you may not like everything you eat and may regret spending so much on the more interesting dishes, but you'll have plenty of food leftover later for thought.",1,0,2,Annie C.,"Los Angeles, CA",25,105,7

Yes please.So eventually I managed an occasion in the Theater district with my lovely parents and good friend, intent on trying the pasta that had haunted my dreams.But their blissful patio on a hot summer day was where the magic ended.

Since we didn't know what time we could be there, arriving to NY, we just went there without a reservation. It was toward the end of the lunch time around 1:15 PM on Wed so it was not crowded at all. They took us in right away and they took our luggages away to a side room - that was very nice of them.But after we sat down, it took them about 20 min to take our order and another 20 min to bring appetizer to the table. And another 40 min to bring our main dish. Even to get a check, it took us for another 15 min... There were many waiters on the floor and even half of the restaurant was gone already when we ordered. Did they go fishing for our order? Was that because we were not in suits and don't look rich? Or we are tourist so they thought we care about time? Actually, we had full schedule everyday! This slow service made us miss our Jimmy Fallon show on the day that we planned from few months ago!!!!The food was good but OK for $80 lunch at a top notch restaurant, I expected more.The restaurant was filled with suits and gray-haired people.

She explained the portion sizes to us, and told us to get 4 courses but to split among two of us. Really enjoyed the yellow fin tuna crudo - it was a flattened version and very tasty. We got the octopus as our second course, the ricotta gnochi as our third and for our entree, the skate. I'm more of an appetizer and tapas style person in general, so if I had to do it over, I may have ordered more of the crudo (raw) first course and second course and possibly skipped out on the pasta and even the main fish.

Clearly he's never seen us put it away, but we decided to play it safe and order a la carte.We made our own crudi tasting and ordered three: scorpionfish and pomegranate (very delicate and mild; I thought it was just a tiny bit under-seasoned but the pomegranate seeds give it a nice brightness), bay scallop with chervil (the balance of the herb with the buttery smooth scallops is amazing, I could eat that all day), big eye tuna carpaccio (pounded flat and thin, seasoned with beautiful salt). High quality ingredients, prepared simply. We completed our first course with a cooked appetizer of razor clams and chilies. The fashionable bivalves are cooked well, the chilies add a kick. It's a good thing that they kept offering more bread to mop up the sauce under the empty clam shells (try the wheat focaccia, it's made in-house). Due to time constraints we combined primi and secondi. We split (they did indeed offer to split the order for us) the spaghetti neri -- squid ink, sea urchin, cuttlefish: delectable -- and the fritto misto, which involved scallops, three kinds of shrimp, calamari, mussels, and oysters, all clad in different breadings designed to complement each seafood treat, and then fried. The portion was quite generous and came with a green herb sauce for dipping, and half a lemon and ramekin of sea salt for seasoning.We didn't get a bottle of wine (we did have a three hour opera to go to afterward) but we split two quartini: one of a Verdicchio de Castel y Jesi (I forget who makes it, but it worked with the crudi) and one of a Sangiovese by Fontezoppa. The wine list is big, Italian, and includes a few Magnums for good measure.For dessert we went for their spin on a cannoli: rings of shell instead of the traditional rolled shape, gianduja cream piped in between, dot of chocolate topped with single hazelnut; prettily plated and tasty, and more elegant to eat than the traditional cannoli, which is nice if you're wearing a purty dress you don't want to get chocolate on. And I can never turn down an affogato (caramel gelato, drowned tableside). There were petit fours of Italian cookies. (I'm a sucker for that rainbow one, with the pink green and yellow cake and chocolate?)Of course after all that we felt obligated to walk the 23 blocks to Lincoln Center, to stave off the food coma.I'd go back for the tasting menu ($75 a person; $120 with wine pairing, add $25 for a crudo supplement -- five, chef's choice), or just to sit at the bar with a bottle of wine and a grip of crudo.",2,0,0,Maya F.,"New York, NY",70,147,21

Octopus was nicely cooked not too tough or too soft. The bean salad is not bad. My hubby had the monkfish cheek which are fried fish nuggets. The taste of the fish is good. Both my husband and my daughter love it.Pasta:We shared the uni and crab meat pasta. It's a you love it or you hate it dish. I had raw uni before and I didn't like it. So I thought cooked uni would taste better. But I could not even stand the smell. But my husband said it's ok. The crab meat is so tiny that I had to actually search for it. The portion of the pasta is small too.  Main course:I had the grilled king fish that the waiter recommended. The portion of the fish was generous and the fish was fresh and good. They just put salt on the fish and grilled it. It came with lentil which was ok. My hubby had the scallops which they said are in season. There were five small scallops. I tried one and it tasted sweet. But they were kind of small.  Dessert:I had the gelato which came in banana, butter cream and chocolate-peanut flavors. They were very good. My hubby had the coffe mouse which was very good too. Overall, I think the food was just ok. It's not worth the money that we paid.

4.0,12/29/2010,"Recently returned to Esca for the first time in many years.We were four at dinner, seated at a roomy table in the middle of the main room, which was warmly lit and had a lively buzz. We opted for the $100/pp tasting menu with the five extra crudo supplement, and an order of the Maccheroni alla Chitarra (house made ""guitar cut"" spaghetti with sea urchin and crabmeat) for the table.The crudo were uniformly excellent and sparkling fresh, and having an extra flight was well worth the additional $25. As others have noted, this really is the highlight of a meal here.Of the following courses, we especially liked the monkfish cheeks and steamers fritti with caper-tarragon aioli; crispy, tender whiting with wilted greens; and a meaty, delicious seared mako shark with caramelized root vegetables. And of course, that uni and crab pasta -- luscious and a perfect dish to share given its creamy richness. One of the other regular menu dishes served in the tasting -- rigatoni with seabass, mussel and clam ragu -- was good-not-great, lacking succulence and with slightly muddied flavors.Desserts were very good and beautifully plated; a different one was served to each of us, which allowed us to share and sample a variety.Service was professional, knowledgeable and unhurried.Even if the cooked dishes didn't quite match the superb crudo in gustatory pleasure, our overall experience at Esca was very satisfying, and the tasting menu a relative value given the quality and variety.",3,0,1,J.

It's worth noting that the tasting menu is a mere fraction of the price it was a few years ago, a testament to the recession, but good news for diners. The standout here is definitely the crudo, each one better than the last. From a perfectly plump, briny oyster to a beautiful branzino with its own cracklings, everything was delicate and delicious. My favorite on this particular evening was the uni dressed lightly in olive oil, perhaps the best sea urchin I've ever had.If this is your first time dining here, their famous ""Maccheroni alla Chittara"" is not to be missed - it is probably the best dish on the menu, composed of perfectly cut fresh spaghetti, creamy sea urchin sauce, crabmeat, and wafer thin strips of crunchy green onion.The wait staff has always been very good, even during peak dinner service, and the decor is simple but warm.If you're looking for a great plate of seafood that is treated right, this is your place.",3,0,1,Darren M.,"Manhattan, NY",4,64,10

4.0,10/19/2010,"Heavily edited. Full review at: lawandfood.blogspot.com/…My mom wanted good seafood. Naturally, I pushed for Marea. However, The DA wrote it up earlier in the year, and I had gone later in the Summer. To my mom, that meant it was off limits, as she wants me to have new content for the blog. Thus, I don't get to eat at Marea again, but everyone still wins. Esca was the next obvious choice (and somewhere we'd wanted to try for a while).When we first were seated, ""Separate Ways"" by Journey, was playing over the speakers (with Eighties greatest hits the rest of the night as well).I sincerely hope that it's now stuck in your head (along with the mental image of Steve Perry ""breakin' the chains"" over and over again). Regardless, the food from Chef Dave Pasternack (google his New Yorker profile, which is a fantastic read) and owners Mario Batali and Joe Bastianich was much better than the music.Almost immediately after being seated we were presented with an amuse of chickpeas, oil and preserved mackarel bruschetta, which, unsurprisingly tasted like hummus with fish.The crudo flight seemed to be the most obvious way to start my meal. Composed of six different crudos served three at a time, the flight showcases the freshest offerings from Chef Pasternack.Fluke with radish was perfectly paired (plus I love fluke), although the oyster was nothing special. Spanish mackerel with crushed almonds was easily the winner, with the acidity from the lemon registering first, followed by the almonds mellowing everything out.  My other two favorites were yellowfin tuna with pickled jalapenos and a diver scallop in lemon with caviar on top. I can't resist the sweetness from a great piece of raw scallop. I don't remember the last one, but I'm sure it was like the others (only significantly less memorable).For their appetizers, my dad ordered fritti, local steamers, rock shrimp, potato chips and lemon jam. Everything was expertly fried (and fresh), but the potato chips are what stood out for me.Apparently my mother really loves fish soup (she'd zeroed in on the mussel soup at Aldea the night before). Zupa de pesca amalfitana was a slightly spicy tomato and fish based soup studded with fresh seafood and topped with a toasted baguette. Can't go wrong with this.My parents split the whole branzino cooked in salt crust, whose simple, yet elegant presentation was the highlight of the evening. The branzino was perfectly cooked and moist throughout-- all it needed was a squirt of lemon.In keeping with the sea urchin theme of the week, I ordered the maccheroni alla chitarra with sea urchin and crab. The pasta was perfectly al dente, while chunks of crab mingled with the urchin, which had been reduced to a viscous, briny sauce. You get the full effect of sea urchin, but I felt the dish was missing something (my dad said cheese, but I shushed him because Dave Pasternack was in earshot. Cheese is verboten!) Really though, it could have used some crushed red pepper flakes or something to break up what ultimately became somewhat monotonous.Still sick, I ordered tea with my dessert (I've never had water that scalding hot before) from their surprisingly broad selection. I had instant buyer's remorse from my mascarpone cheesecake, but it was pretty good, especially with the grapes and nuts accompanying it. My dad, on the other hand, inhaled his mocha panna cotta within a minute, so I can only assume it was good as I didn't even get a taste. I looked up from my cheesecake (only two bites in) and he was scraping up the remainder of the sauce with his spoon. He never does that, so you can safely assume that the panna cotta is probably pretty good. Cookies were great (anything with pistachio in it, especially biscotti, are impossible for me to resist).So in eating at Esca, I guess, like Steve Perry, I broke the chains that bound me and finally-- aw forget it that's a terrible analogy. The only time people talk/think about Journey nowadays is when it's belted out in a shitty bar at 3 AM. Esca is simply too good to be compared with Journey, and if you disagree, we may have to go our separate ways (wow, that might have been worse).",5,4,5,Chief H.,"New York, NY",33,76,3

4.0,8/21/2010,"Before Marea opened,  Esca used to be the big, bad Italian seafood on the block. It also had one of the most talented teams in the business with Dave Pasternack at the helm, and Mario Batali and Joe Bastianich as partners. Such talent nearly guaranteed success, and it is no surprise that the restaurant is still going strong 10 years later. Unfortunately, it has taken exactly the same amount of time to get around making a reservation. Seafood is one of those things that is hard to cook well: each fish has a specific texture and flavor profile that changes the manner in how one cooks it, and the slightest veering of attention when cooking it can cause the dish to revolt like a temperamental child. This is why was looking to going Esca with great anticipation, but also some nervousness, as really bad seafood can deflate my dining experience like reverse-Viagara.For appetizers, the trio of crudos were surprisingly some of the least inspiring items on the menu. I'm sure crudo was outre ten years ago, but doesn't cause much of a glance nowadays. The lunch trio consisted of branzino topped with pieces of its own cracklings, a hamachi topped with a small Gaeta olive, and a piece of fluke with a compote of small watermelon balls and radish batons. The fish were fresh, as one would expected from how meticulously Esca sources it's seafood, but only the fluke really impressed me. The sweetness of the watermelon and the slight singe of pepperiness from the radish harmonized perfectly with the sea flavor of the fluke. However, the salad of fresh heirloom cherry tomatoes more than outshadowed the famous crudo. Apparently, Esca sources their tomatoes from some small artisan farmer in Pennsylvania. I swear I have never had tomatoes that ripe, sweet, and earthy in my entire life; if I could have bribed the waiter $50 to set me up with that friendly farmer, I would have not  blinked an eye in doing so.Next were the pasta dishes: maccheroni a la chitarra (thick-cut spaghetti with sea urchin and crab) and the spaghetti neri (squid ink spaghetti with cuttlefish, scallions, and green chilies). For those who've never indulged in sea urchin, it's shocking how buttery and unctuous it makes any pasta dish; you'll either love it (like I did) or hate it. However, I was a bit disappointed in the stingy portions of crab; you really need that to offset the creaminess in that dish. I thought the spaghetti neri was much better in execution. It reminded me of the arroz nero that is served along the beach restaurants on the Barcelona coast, with the squid ink pasta basking in a pool of cuttlefish and red pepper.Lastly the mains. We split an expertly cooked pan-fried flounder which was served with an intriguing compote of hazelnuts, walnuts, and cashews. If I could rave about any one dish, it would be the fritto misto amalfitano. Fritto misto is usually a grab-bag of seafood odds and ends, but this one included halibut and cod, small baitfish, calamari rings and tentacles, topped off with fried bits of parsley. It was really a perfect dish, with the freshness of each component of the fritto misto highlighted by a ridiculously good, bright-green parsley aioli.We ended the meal with an affogato that struck the perfect balance between espresso and gelato. This is what a good one should taste like, and the bits of toffee and nuts at the bottom of the glass were a surprise addition. The lemon frittelle with blueberry sauce were tasty, but nowhere as light, airy, and flavorful as the little sonhos (beignets) they serve at Aldea. The torta di pesche with vanilla gelato was good, but would only place show among the three desserts we had.Like old James Brown records, Esca is an oldie but goodie that merits revisiting if one hasn't been there in a while; if one hasn't been there, put it on the good foot, and get there.",8,2,7,Jonas M.,"Brooklyn, NY",6,166,0

The grilled squid calamari was great as well.Since this is an Italian restaurant and they make there own pasta we had to at least share a dish.

3.0,5/29/2010,"wow...we had a 5 star and last night a 2 star...so we are averaging and coming up with a 3 star.We had reservations last night. We brought a special bottle of wine with us from home - a 2002 Silver Oak. Anticipating a fabulous meal paired with one of our favorite wines. This was a celebration dinner that we were eagerly looking forward to. We arrived and placed our bottle of wine on our table. Our server welcomed us and presented the wine list to us and began explaining the wines. I was a bit dumbfounded as he was holding the list directly in front of our bottle of wine and completely ignoring its existence. When finished he asked if we had any questions. At this point my husband said, well yes, can we have you open this bottle for us? (expecting corkage fees and not caring what they might be) Our server seemed a little awkward and told us that they ""don't allow customers to bring their own wine unless it is a wine they actually serve then they would open it for us"". REALLY?! This put us off immediately. Living in Northern California and being well traveled (with our wines in tow) we have never experienced a ""no corkage"" policy such as this. The next day we reviewed their website and could not find any mention of this policy nor was it mentioned on their wine list. In addition we found it odd that when we arrived with our wine - the hostess did not mention the policy to us. We don't dispute they have this policy - we just find it odd that it is not mentioned anywhere in writing...leaving it open for other unsuspecting guests to make the same faux pas. Trying to get beyond our initial put off -  my husband perused the wine list for about 10 minutes. The Sommelier came over and asked if he could be of help. My husband ordered a glass (which I can't recall now what it was but it was delicious) and we anticipated our meal. Well...we anticipated the menu...which took another 20 minutes to arrive. We were then approached several times by different people to take our order. We were unclear at this point as to who our waiter actually was. It seemed very confused - our waiter seemed to be bussing, serving, waiting and cashiering. Making for long gaps between requests and delivery. We finished our meal and decided to skip dessert. To the chef and kitchen staffs credit the only saving grace of our entire evening was their food. It was amazing. We sat awkwardly at the end of the meal at a totally empty table...waiting for our check...we had to flag down our waiter after about 15 minutes to get our check.

The general impression is it seemed a bit disorganized. We had a reservation and were asked to wait about 10 minutes (no problem) but then once we were seated it was about 15 more minutes before we received our menus.I had the spaghetti neri (squink ink) with green chiles, cuttlefish and scallions) which was delicious. Portion was enough that you'd want to get at least another appetizer or main course to accompany. For my entree I chose the crispy skate. I wish I'd chosen differently, ""crispy"" was too battered and fried for my taste, I love skate but thought this killed it's delicate flavor/texture but the portion was huge. My 2 friends had the branzino for two which everyone agreed was excellent and appreciate the presentation of our waiter bringing it to our table for approval before cooking.Overall, I think Esca features great ingredients, a incredible wine list and a strong menu/chef.

We are fans of Lupa and we love fresh fish so I thought Esca would be worth the visit. We had expectations to be blown away because of the price tag and reviews. $18 for a dandelion salad and $18+ for the crudo-4 thin slices of raw fish etc. So we walked in at 730, the staff were nice-the restaurant interior ok. We had to remind the waiter for some bread after the tables around us already had and 40 min. had passed . My husband ordered the pink snapper crudo. it was fresh and it had red lava salt. it was great. then we split the gnocchi. Large serving, glad we split, delicous. then we each ordered the grouper with chickpeas. Dissapointing. It was good, but we were expecting a journey in our mouth. The chickpeas and parsely were in the mildly spicy red sauce with blended well with the sauted fish but there were not fireworks. you could get this anywhere. not worth $34 an entree.

5.0,5/15/2010,"On my last night in New York, I finally made it to the one restaurant I had marked as a must visit when I read about it in one of those seat pocket airplane magazines. I was immediately impressed by Dave Pasternack's ability to find the right fish guy for every fish, bypassing the middleman. I remember that review describing a remote Eskimo who supplies the chef with some niche fish and wondering what fish I'd choose and where in the world it would come from.As a southern coastal Italian restaurant, I had high expectations for the seafood, as that was my favorite food on my Amalfi Coast visit. Everything was so fresh and real in Italy. Esca did not disappoint.My friend David and I decided to make an event of it given my last night instead of just going for food, so we started off with a bottle of wine and a half dozen oysters. Given the wine list was all Italian, we consulted the sommelier who recommended the dry Moscato del Veneto ""Sirio"" Vignalta 2007 Veneto from the Northeast. The oysters were Widow's Hole and Peter's point, all large and succulent.It was a tough decision to forgo a crudo dish of raw seafood, but the Altro dish (cooked appetizer) of clams with prosciutto was too enticing to pass up and really, how many dishes can we do?From there, we went to our primi dish of spaghetti neri, which was squid ink spaghetti with tiny cuttlefish, green chilies, and scallion. The chilies gave it a surprising kick and the squid ink gave it a fantastic and beautiful texture.Our Secondi dish, we went for the Branzino per Tre, which was a whole Mediterranean sea bass cooked in sea salt. Teased by the display of this fish to our neighboring table... The waiter brought it out caked in the salt for our inspection prior to serving it up on our individual plates. While it was meant for 3 people, it was perfect for two even with all the other food. I normally don't care for fish that may have bones in it, but the server deboned it expertly, leaving no inedible remains and a magnificently flavored fish. Clearly the chef understands fish better than any other chef's seafood concoctions I've ever tasted before, knowing just what it needed, and didn't. Our complex dishes in this meal combined wonderful flavors, while our main dish was so simple and perfect.To finish, we couldn't fathom any more food, so we both ended with a digestivo instead of dessert. I can't remember the name of mine, but it was a carmel flavored liquor and a wonderful end to a fantastic meal.The restaurant itself appeared small, with only a handful of tables inside and a large al fresca dining space on a neighboring patio, but this added to the intimacy of the place. There was a more formal side of the restaurant, but I was happy with our bright, open, yet intimate table. The space was overwhelmed with branches of a flowering live pink rhododendron to add personality.Our service was attentive. I appreciated that the wait staff seemed less like starving actors and more like professional service people, unlike other restaurants in this Hell's Kitchen neighborhood.Overall, Esca tops my restaurant experience in New York, Coming in a close second only to Nobu.

It's great if you want to try everything and if you have no idea what to choose (the list is amazingly long!)Dishes that stood out for me:Pumpkin swordfish crudo- delicious raw swordfish with crushed almonds and doused in olive oil. I highly recommend this crudo because the sweet taste of almonds brings out the delicateness of the swordfish.Fegato di pescatrice- cooked and seared monkfish liver. I prefer it raw, but this works well too. I really liked the rhubarb that it is cooked with. Stacked beautifully in a little box next to the liver. Presentation at its finest.Spaghetti neri- squid ink spaghetti with slivers of cuttlefish. This dish was very memorable. It had a kick at the end of each bite, thanks to the chilies incorporated. Stand out and solid dish. Only complaint: I'm not sure if they give this to everyone, but we got the goat cheese in a scoop right before the dessert. I understand this is to clean our palette after eating the delicious entrees, but a scoop? Really now? I would prefer it if it were on a spoon, just a dollop. The overpowering bluntness of the goat cheese grossed me out. Plus, I looked like a poo eater for returning the dish with only 1/6 of the scoop touched.Recommendations: do the wine pairing.

3.0,2/22/2010,"I must admit - there are few restaurants that I've been more excited to go to than Esca. Between the anecdotal praising from friends, and the effusive reviews written by both Frank Bruni (David Pasternack is the ""Fish Whisperer"") and Adam Platt (""Top 10 Restaurants in NYC""), I was expecting a meal near transcendent. The Crudo certainly were. The rest of the meal though, was just good. Pink Snapper, Hawaiian Ahi Tuna, and Sea Bass Crudo to start. All were perfect: simply garnished with olive oil/coarse salt and thickly cut, but with a melt-in-your-mouth consistency. Truth be told, even after sharing three, I could have done an entirely seperate flight - these Crudo were that good.The pasta, however, was a major disappointment. Spaghetti Neri with Cuttlefish and Green Chillis was overcooked - the sauce was spicy and tasty, but the noodles themselves were soft and mushy. Oppositely, the Spaghetti with Sea Urchin and Crab had noodles boiled perfectly al dente, but the sauce itself was mediocre (the crab added no real texture to the dish, and the Sea Urchin was surprisingly subtle and bland). We did not finish either of these dishes.The Secondi, however, brought the meal back to life. The highlight was a simply grilled Mahi Mahi. Juicy, flakey, and fresh - delicious to the very last bite.Service was inexplictably inconsistent, especially as the restaurant was half-empty during our first 30 minutes. It took almost 10 minutes for our server to follow-up on whether we wanted to order wine; and almost 20 minutes before we were even handed food menus. Throughout the meal, our waiter was hard to nail down - it took a level of proactivity that you don't expect from diners in very good restaurants. The sommelier was fantastic though: helpful, outgoing, and funny. And, we received a free glass of Allegrini Recioto to make up for the pastas.

The pasta was really the saving grace, with a rich, creamy sea urchin sauce to coat. But if you're lookng a stronger uni taste, a sushi bar is probably a better bet.The ambience was a bit dated and bland (not in a hip, minimalist way either). Like other reviewers below, the death blow was the service -- completely suffocating.

The array of crudo to start off the mean was interesting, and i love raw fish, but everything had too much course sea salt on it. I understand that the italian method for preparing raw fish is oil and salt, but it was the same damn thing for every piece of crudo, and breaking my teeth on rock salt that people use to thaw out their driveways isn't appealing to me. The secondi course was a well-executed if basic pasta dish with clams. Not exactly Iron Chef caliber. Our main course was a fish baked in a sea salt crust...forgot the name of the fish...I'm thinking John Dory?...but while the fish was moist and flavorful, it was not worth the $34 per person for a filet of fish with nothing else.

Perhaps worth it, but far from what I can pay and I have a feeling it's over priced ( I know mario b. is a businessman first and foremost, but still  it should be a price that the customer is so comfortable paying they're distracted from the price.)

He was so insistant that we EACH read our menu as he ""walked us through it"" (as though we needed it) that while I was peaking over at my BFs menu, politely acting like I needed a ""walk-through"" (I am only getting a masters in this right now, but sure, I understand that this is the thing that you do here so fine hold my hand) he actually tapped me on the shoulder and got right down near my face and said ""Madam"", forcing an open menu in my hand and pointed to where we were on the page. WOW. ocd much? So fine, I giggled to myself and went about my business. THEN we're finally ready to order and we wanted to begin by sharing some crudo -""SHARE? the crudo are for one person. You're only ordering 3 and there are five of you. Here, let me explain how you order here at Esca.""again, seriously?! So, we said nicely ""oh, thats ok, let us just tell you what we were thinking and then you can give us recommendations based on that."" 3 crudos. 2 pastas. 3 mains. Just put it in the middle and give us extra plates. Family style. A little of everything. For everyone! (the joy of life, a taste of everything, right?)Ordering threw him totally-- he just could not seem to wrap his head around the fact that we wanted the food to come like that. We actually wanted the fritto misto with the crudo, but he basically said no we couldn't have that. So, again, fine, whatever. He also wanted to point out that we understood that there would be 6 plates on the table when he brought out the crudo and pastas, and--did we realize-- only 5 of us?? He looked extremely perplexed by this. I pointed out that we would like it if the crudo could come before the pastas, and finally the mains. Would that be so difficult?Yes! because then there would only be 3 plates on the table and , we did realize didn't we? there were only 5 of us. So bring a few empty plates. we promise we will make it work. Yes, well, (he felt compelled to tell us) that just won't be enough food. PHEW. absolutely nuts. we were in stitches initially because of how incredible he was ( I do know his name, but I'm going to be nicer  than he ever was, and keep this to myself).

4.0,9/28/2009,"Yes, the crudo is jump-for-joy yummy, and the seafood is always well cooked and delightfully seasoned.  However, a few shortcomings prevent this otherwise great restaurant from being on the top of my Batali restaurant list.  For instance, the sea urchin pasta is quite nice but the urchin was pureed into a uniformly textured, creamy sauce and although it tasted fine, it was not all that impressive.  I prefer the uni pasta at Basta Pasta, which not only has a great tasting uni sauce, but leaves you with chunks of fresh uni snuggled warmly between the strands of your spaghetti.   Finally, I feel it is slightly overpriced (Esca's uni pasta is $24 while Basta's is $19).  I admit I haven't been to an Italian seafood restaurant this good anywhere else in the city.  But still, my wallet told me its too expensive.P.S.

The snapper was refreshing, but at $18 for 3 pieces of sashimi, it should be. The sea urchin pasta was awesome - I loved this. The cod was just ehh - it tasted tender but the presentation was a little sad. Literally it was a white, card-deck sized piece of fish with a lump of unidentifiable greens on a pure white plate. No sauce. This was $36 and I've definitely had better for that price. Thank goodness for the restaurant.com certificate. Service slowed to a crawl at the end of the night.

4.0,7/30/2009,"Having spent four months abroad in Italy, I know my bruschetta.  And the moment I bit into the complimentary bruschetta starter, I knew this was going to be a great meal.  The small toasted pieces of bread were crunchy on the bottom and topped with a surprisingly not overpowering puree of white bean, red onion and garlic.  Super delish! On a scale of 1-10, the crudo tasting gets a 15.  It was probably the best starter I have had in my life, no exaggerations.  It started with an oyster, moved on to four types of fish, and ended with the most ridiculously beautiful and scrumptious razor clam. If you just want a taste of the crudo instead of trying the tasting, I'd get the pink snapper which was also incredible, and the razor clam with mint and chilis.  We also split the stuffed zucchini blossoms, which compared to those I ate in Rome's Jewish Ghetto where they are most well known.  Really great stuff.  My godfather had the heirloom tomato salad, which he said was good, but nothing he hadn't had before. Our pastas were delicious.  Perfectly cooked and chewy as they should be.  I got the spaghetti with chilis, mint, and lobster which was yummy, and I also got to try to ricotta gnocchi, which was really awesome as well.  The main courses were not as great.  I split the monkfish, which was fine but weirdly battered? And my godfather got the chicken, which the waiter told us would have a ""surprise""...not a particularly appetizing one, unfortunately, as the chicken's feet were still attached and presented in a way that they interlocked on the plate.  It tasted good, but I'm still a squemish American when it comes to having an in-your-face visual that what you're eating is actually an animal.  Desserts were really delicious! Another highlight!  I got the affogato, a caramel gelato topped with some sort of candied nut and freshly poured espresso.  The other dessert was a trio of apricot, canteloupe, and currant sorbetti and it was probably the most tempting and beautifully presented dessert I've ever seen.  So refreshing! The service was spot on--they were all super attentive.  And the wine was delicious too--try the Friulano.  I'm giving Esca a four because the entrees were not amazing...but the crudo tasting, the pasta,  the desserts totally made up for it.

Then the New Yorker profile of a great fisherman turned chef. The excellent Artisan cookbook, The Young Man & the Sea. The few half-hearted attempts at making a reservation, and being kicked off into call-a-month-in-advance territory. Still, what took so long? Should have taken longer. When a friend made reservations for his birthday, we pounced, arriving on a cold Friday night eager to be transported to the Italian seaside. Instead, our journey took us to that sterile, high-end New York tourist dining experience of over-priced food served by a bevy of staff bordering on the obsequious, leaving everyone adrift in an evening of cheerful banter that masked a feeling, too private to share, of being the only one with a dud for dinner.Afterward, though, it was confirmed, as the relief of comparing notes turned into a free-for-all. Esca--that night at least--is a restaurant of stunning mediocrity. The crudo was flavorless, three pieces for the same price as a sashimi deluxe anywhere in the city. Calling the fried calamari ""calamaretti"" is a clever trick--it's not so much that they're baby calamari as that it's a plate of nicely fried breading strewn over an arugula salad, with maybe one in five crispy crumbs containing a rubbery piece of squid. The same paucity of flesh afflicted the shrimp--all shell, no meat. The brodetto tasted weak, thin, and vaguely brackish, with every piece of fish and shellfish overcooked. Pastas were gummy. The wild striped bass, the portion no larger than deck of cards, had the flavor literally blasted out of it by the over-hot grill; it rested atop a pool of mushy lentils garnished by the one truly delicious thing tasted all night, balsamic-braised cippolini.Desserts? Not bad, but curiously out of sync with the rest of the meal: too large, too sweet, falling into the category of generously average as opposed to the other courses, which strived for, and utterly failed, to be precious excellence.Of course, it's not always about the food. It was a convivial birthday dinner. Now, if only someone else picked up the check....",0,0,0,David S.,"New York, NY",0,3,0

4.0,10/10/2008,"I have been to Esca four times since July and I can honestly say that the food has lived up to the Bastianich and Batali names. Reservations are recommended, but if you are a walk-in or are running early, be sure to grab a drink with the long-time bartender Paulie who will share some anecdotes from ""old New York"" and inspire your choice of drink. The breadsticks at the bar are also noteworthy, yum!Beginning with the amuse, most recently a croute with imported Italian tuna and tuscan white beans, the high quality of the food is evident. The warm gaeta olives in sicilian olive oil with candied citrus rind and the housemade bread are all delicious. I have done the 5 course tasting menu twice, once with the extra crudo (Italian-style sashimi) and, though I could barely make it to dessert, it was well worth it each time. Just make sure that you have enough time to enjoy it thoroughly - they do not rush you. The crudo is as fresh and pristine as fish can be. The selections change regularly based on the sustainable supply and quality of fish. The pasta dishes are phenomenal, particularly the black squid ink pasta with calamari. It has the perfect kick for the spice tolerant. Desserts are very good, but not necessary if you are ordering a la carte (If you must, I recommend the crespelles).  The service is also noteworthy and highly accommodating without being stuffy or overly attentive. This is a perfect three star restaurant.

The spaghetti was certainly al dente...not a fan.I shy away from seafood in my pasta but apparently they failed miserably on the mare-pastas.  My friend seemed genuinely bothered by how bad the meal was - very fishy and oversalted as well.  Not good.

While the seafood is undoubtably fresh and extremely well prepared, the menu is ala carte and pretty pricey for the amount of food you receive. I ordered Sea Bass that came grilled on a small bed of arugula. It was $34. My husband had the lobster spaghetti which was simple yet tasty. The portion however was small for the $30 price tag.The sides are limited to primarily vegetables and enough for 2 to share. I ordered a side of greens that ran $9.

Holy Christ, the choices are numerous and enticing, and choosing what we were going to order was a feat in itself because there were so many great options.  We ordered the crudo (the Italian answer to sushi) and chose the Tuna with which was carpaccio style with olio verde and chives, as well as six oysters that were so fresh they tasted like they were plucked from the ocean moments before.  The crudo was very tasty and fun to eat, but the oysters stole the show, they were that insanely good.In between all of this a very nice busboy came to our table probably more often than most to offer us pieces of warm homemade bread that we couldn't help but devour.We ordered a pasta dish to share in between our appetizers and main courses.  Don't you find that the one dish you add on as an extra usually winds up to be the one you love the most?  We ordered the linguine... and we were forewarned that the dish was more on the salty side, but we ordered it anyway.... it sounds simple enough, but when the plate of steaming linguine mixed in with scallops, mussels, hot red pepper and pancetta came in front of us, we weren't ready for the intoxicating taste that followed.  The dish is right up there with some of my favorite entrees in Italy, it is amazing.  We didn't find it too salty at all, it was perfect.We then shared the whole Mediterranean sea bass for two cooked in a sea salt crust... the sea bass arrived on our table whole, and then was whisked away and deboned and arranged for us so that way each piece was bone free and could melt in your mouth.  It was wonderful and fresh, and by then we were almost full but couldn't help but scape the plates clean.Two grappas, two double espressos, and a lovely dessert of ice cream and caramel that was submerged in some sort of capuccino was also devoured...

Or something.That being said -- if you are in the mood for a face full of fish, this is a decent option.",1,0,1,Nathan J.,"New York, NY",33,71,1

The sea urchin and razor clams were awesome. Also shared the whole fish that's cooked encrusted with sea salt. They crack it out of it's salt shell for you tableside.

3.0,9/3/2007,"""Excited, then a little disappointed, and then fireworks.""Just got back from a dinner and a show, and ESCA was the place that was decided to be the kickoff point for our evening.  And as many recommended before us, we went with the tasting menu with the wine accompaniment.  The decor was excellent and fitting, nothing too ostentatious but functional.  The crudo that we had was excellent and varied among all 4 of us.  This way we all could taste each others raw fish.  The olive oil used in all of the dishes was fantastic and the quality spoke for itself.  The goat cheese ravioli with guacale was amazing and was by far the star of the evening.  But as we descended down the list, the stars began to fall.  The wolf fish was over cooked (and fried, hmm) and the sea bass was yet again over cooked.  I read a few other reviews and it seems like ESCA is starting to be known for this.  If you are going to an establishment that is named ""Bait"" and serves all seafood, and prides itself on the excellent crudos (raw things), then why is the fish cooked well over it's heat capacity.  Fresh fish, especially a menu that rotates around the ""catch of the day"" should feature the fish at it's optimal cooking point.  I guess I have grown accustomed to ""raw is the only way to get fresh fish"" methodology, well, then Mario, needs to get back in the kitchen and ask the chefs to take the fish off the fire.  This would be similar with his philospohy of pulling the pasta out in order to get that al dente texture.  Don't get me wrong, the deserts (I'm not a sweets guy and I could not put the spoon down) and the wines were amazing and was well worth the price of admission, but when you are spending the money that we spent, you would expect a little more from the ""Child of Batali"".  The deserts, like stated previously, were absolutely amazing, and really brought me back around for the experience.  Next time I think we will explore the whole crudo section of the menu, order a bowl of the ravioli or the squid ink risotto, and share one of the many deserts and chase it with an espresso.  Ciao.",2,0,2,Taishi T.,"New York, NY",90,123,26

5.0,8/26/2007,"Two of my favorite things to eat... sashimi and pasta.  Well, here at Esca, I can have the best of both worlds!  Mario Batali has weaved in an amazing crudo (Italian sashimi) menu at Esca along w/ the more traditional italian / Mediterranean fare.  The crudo menu portion is along worth the visit.  My mouth was watering as I read each item... oysters, bay scallops, fluke, hamachi, bluefin tuna, etc...  When I was finally able to move on to the other side of the menu, I was pleased to see a great selection of appetizers, pastas, and main entrees.  With all the choices, I was somewhat overwhelmed.  Well, our waiter to the rescue.  Not only did he provide good, professional service, but I must credit him for recommending some excellent dishes.  All of his choices were spot on.My 2 friends and I decided to share everything (love family style, esp at restaurants i'm checking out for the first time).  We started w/ 2 crudo: bay scallops (super fresh and delicious) and medium fatty blue fin toro with just the right amount of olive oil, herbs, and a sprinkling of some nice sea salt which provided a nice slight crunch to the fish.  We then had fried freshwater eel for apps... nice batter (not too oily)... never had eel like this before.  The next dish was one of the best pasta dishes i've ever had!  Just thinking about it is making me hungry... maccheroni alla chitarra.  This was divine... perfectly house-made thick pasta noodles with sea urchin and crabmeat.  I would've never thought uni would go well w/ pasta... who knew that it's actually a marriage made in culinary heaven.  The uni provided a great texture and a bit of sweetness... the buttery flavor with the pasta and small chunks of crab was delicious... and surprisingly, not that heavy.  For our main meal, we had a lovely black cod; good but paled in comparison to the secondi pasta dish.  Also could not help but take the waiter's recommendation for the lemon cake dessert -- another winner.  I can honestly say that everything I ate that night tasted good to great.  Rare that I'm completely satisfied with every dish but I was!  The interior is not all that interesting but it's comfortable.  The focus here is on the food and that's where my focus was for most of the night.  Definitely will be going back for some more crudo and the pasta.",3,0,3,camilla c.,"New York, NY",171,336,1

4.0,6/25/2007,"Went there for a work dinner and was very impressed.  The waiter was very knowedgable and helpful with the menu and wine list.For an appetizer we had the Polipo (Octopus) which was great, but could have been bigger.  Also had the Anguila which are little fried eels that are served like french fries (breaded and fried).For the first course the three of us split the Taglierini which is a spaghetti like pasta with scallops and black truffles.  It was perfectly done and a great idea to share, so we could get an entree and a pasta.For the entree I had the skate which was lightly breaded and fried.  It was nicely cooked, but too salty.  Another person in my group had the halibut, which was also very good, but too salty.For dessert we had a selection of gelatos which were all great.Overall, I'd say it was a very well done seafood restaurant with a variety of tastes and creativity.  The wines were nice and complemented the meal well.  Service was great.",1,0,1,Ted H.,"West Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA",10,88,2
3.0,6/20/2007,"I'm a fan of Mario's restaurants and the guy. Read the book ""HEAT"" for a realistic view of the man and Babbo. Very interesting.My wife and I went to Esca for our 2nd anniversary. We had a very nice meal. The service was attentive, although I didn't like the fact that we didn't have a dedicated waiter/waitress. Our service was split between two people. Ah well, that's one of my pet peeves when you're paying prices like this. Both of our servers were great, though.I went for the crudo sampler and my wife had the soft-shell crabs, both of which were amazing. We also split the squid-ink pasta as our second course. Very good. For our entrees, my wife got the whole fried scorpion fish which was fantastic. On the other hand, I got the seared sturgeon. I was under-whelmed. The fish was under-done and a bit muddy tasting. I should note, I love raw and rare-cooked fish, so that wasn't the issue. In this case, the protein of the sturgeon was just under-cooked enough to be chewy in the center. Not entirely bad, but enough to make note of.I would recommend Esca and will try it again myself. Fish is a difficult thing to consistently get right and it shows here. It makes me appreciate a place like La Bernadin a bit more since every fish dish there comes out perfection. Give Esca a try, though.",1,0,1,John W.,"Hoboken, NJ",0,2,0

3.0,5/30/2007,"I'm waivering between three and four stars here. Three of us arrived around 9:30 on a Tuesday evening--not exactly prime dining time. We were told we couldn't be seated outside (despite the fact that it was more than half empty) and we were put at a table directly next to the kitchen and bathrooms. Granted, we were a party of three casually dressed young people, and they didn't expect much out of us, but it's still off-putting to be so obviously treated poorly in a restaurant. Our waitress was helpful and attentive however, despite the fact that the hostess was a total bitch.The wine list, as is to be expected, is Italian-heavy, but it's decently large with a tolerable selection of red, whites and sparklers, and overall fairly moderately priced, with a few standout bottles hitting $200 and above. PS- don't go by the wine list they have online, they are COMPLETELY different.As for the food, the amuse of bruchetta with navy beans and pickled mackeral was fantastic. The crudo toro was really outstanding, the grilled octopus was delicious with a light char, and the razor clam was fresh, although not particularly flavorful. The broccoli rabe was great, and so were the fingerling potatoes, but the button mushrooms drenched in balsalmic were bland at best. The pasta in the spaghetti neri--homemade squid ink spaghetti--was fantastic with a great bite and a smooth texture, and the light tomato sauce was perfect for the strong pasta, but the calamari was horrifically overcooked. ""Horrifically overcooked"" is about all I can say about the entree, as well. I can't even remember what the fish was because it was basically just a dry, chewy mass. Not to mention it was supposed to have a ramps sauce, and there was nary a ramp in sight, much to my disappointment.They had a nice selection of after dinner drinks, of which we had the amarone platinum grappa...mmmm!! I love a restaurant that carries good grappa.So, overall, some of the food was excellent, some was mediocre at best, the service was (just barely) passable and the prices could have been worse. That seems like a solid three stars, yes?This is longest review ever known to man. Uh, sorry.",0,0,0,Hannah A.,"Brooklyn, NY",13,77,0
5.0,5/7/2007,"another meal that makes me want to chronicle every bite -- but their menu changes every day so it wouldn't do much good!  still, i will list the highlights:1) the yellowfin tuna carpaccio: oh.  my.  god.  it was so so so good.  i absolutely ADORE raw tuna, and this was some of the best raw tuna i have ever had.2) the grilled baby octopus: not recommended for anyone who gets squeamish when their food looks like what it actually is, given the body and little legs were laid out on the plate like a baby octopus would be, but it was really delicious.  sorry, little baby octopus!3) the maccheroni (i didn't misspell that, it's the way they had it on the menu) with sea urchin: another ""oh. my. god."" dish.  it was amazing.  and split three ways it was the perfect amount of pasta, since we also had main entrees on the way.4) the scallops: i wish i had ordered them.  i had a bite of my dad's and they were wonderful -- succulent, sweet, tender but still firm... mmm delish.5) our waiter: he was great!  other reviewers have complained about bad service, but we all agreed that it was some of the best service we've had in a long while.  he was friendly, attentive without being pushy, really helpful in picking out two (very tasty) bottles of wine... i mean, my entree was a bit disappointing (i had the zuppa de pesce) but our waiter was so pleasant that he earned back the 5th star i would've otherwise taken away.so, to wrap up, the restaurant is very expensive and i could never afford to eat there on my own (at least not yet) but i was very happy to go for my dad's birthday.  i guess the wide range of ratings past reviewers have given esca is a reflection of the daily changing menu, but i would definitely recommend taking your chances.",2,3,3,Lily T.,"Brooklyn, NY",131,275,0

2.0,11/30/2006,"Sorry, I'm going to go against the grain and recount my bad experience at Esca.  We came here to celebrate my birthday with high hopes of a wonderful dinner and great service.  The restaurant itself is extremely elegant with soft lighting, and a good amount of wood for a comfy feel.  However, I was less than comfortable.  First, our table was located in a small room with a whole bunch of other tables... I felt like I could have leaned over and grabbed the diners sitting on both sides of us.  In fact, I overheard snippets of conversations from the people seated next to us and it was difficult going to the rest room since the table literally had to be pulled out so I could get out.. trust me, there was almost no room between tables!!Secondly, what weighed on me more was the disappointing food.  It was bland, the fish I ordered was completely overcooked and the vegetable sides tasted like the flavor was boiled out of them.. mushy and undistinguishable.  All of this for about 150 bux... with one drink each.  If you ask me, that is overpriced for mediocre food.I know Esca has a great reputation for good seafood with Mario Batali's name backing it but I didn't see any of that the night I dined there.  We found out later that when we were patrons, Executive Chef David Pasternack had left Esca..

5.0,7/5/2006,"I recently dined with a party of eight at Esca.  The atmosphere is kind of coastal Mediterranean, a little dim, and sleek and rustic if those last two words can be used to describe the same place.  The food menu changes daily so rather than describe specific dishes, I thought I might caution you what to expect and what friends you choose to bring along.  The Tasting menu with wine pairings is the way to go.  The Tasting menu will always have a Crudo del Mercato which is basically whatever they caught that day served up raw.  Other courses are guarantied to have additional ingredients that some diners might consider adventurous a la baby octopus, etc.  My point is that the tasting menu is only available if the entire table agrees to order it.  One picky eater or non-raw participant and your table is out of luck.  We convinced all eight people to go for it and we did and we were rewarded with a fantastic gastronomic experience.  The wine list at Esca all Italian so brush up.  Tasting menu with selected wine pairings is $95.00 per person.  I would definitely go back to Esca.",3,0,1,Michael N.,"Bloomingdale, NJ",37,72,20

Fish, fish fish. Thankfully they way they cook it, it's fantastic.  I started with some crudo (raw fish, italian sashimi) which was good, but had large peices of pepper that crunched and I don't like crunchy when I'm eating raw halibut belly. Next I split two pasta dishes: linguini with some clams and some amazing green gnocci. The pasta was wonderful. I split the snapper, which came with some fancy pesto-like spread; it was good, but not as good as I expected. (It looked and smelled like everyone ordered the sea bass baked in salt crust). For dessert I had the espresso cake which was phenomenal: dense espresso cake, espresso ice cream on top and a coffee.  Overall, it was very enjoyable. It's unpretensious and quite accessable. The waiters were very attentive and choreographed clearning courses off the table. They finish preparing the baked fish dishes in the dining room so you get to smell and watch the fun.

The other fish dishes are all incredible - I've never seen such huge cuts of sea bass! You simply can't go wrong with this menu. In terms of wine selection it's just a matter of narrowing down the list - this is an exhaustive list of regional wines from all over Italy. Since Joe Bastianich is also involved and has his own vineyard in Friuli, there is an incredible focus on lesser known wines from producers that are perfectly suited to the menu. The sommelier is so helpful - don't be afraid to ask for suggestions. Esca is an incredible destination - especially for fish lovers.",0,0,1,Mariangela S.,"San Francisco, CA",172,609,2
