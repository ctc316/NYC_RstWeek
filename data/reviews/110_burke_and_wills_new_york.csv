5.0,4/29/2019,"How have I never been here before? This place has everything: delicious food with a broadly appealing menu, a quieter back room for conversations where you can hear each other, and even a staircase leading up to the Cricket Club speakeasy. Not to knock the UWS dining scene but this place would be more at home somewhere like maybe the West Village or Chelsea. Definitely want to come back again. We started off with the crab beignets. Having only tried the sweet version, it took awhile for the flavor to grow on me but you can't ever go wrong with deep-fried dough with flecks of crab meat. I love a place that has a ton of vegetable sides and appetizers: it basically lets me concoct my own spread. I went with the grilled asparagus, roasted beets and the leafy greens. Plus Brussels sprouts to share. Of the four sources of roughage, I could have done without the leafy greens - the herbs got to be a bit too much. But I loved the other three, especially the grilled asparagus, which I could have eaten a few more plates of. My cousins' rigatoni and gnocchi were also tasty. Dessert: The most surprising was the pavlova. I tend to gravitate towards the heavier desserts, like the sticky toffee bread pudding. Pretty sinful but absolutely worth it. I kept on licking the spoon to get every drop of sauce. Also look up ""Burke & Wills expedition."" It's a true story, with a pretty unfortunate ending.",4,0,3,Joy G.,"New York, NY",1203,824,173
5.0,4/23/2019,"GREAT BRUNCH PLACE! The elk burger was sooo tasty and it comes with a fried egg. So close to the train stop which is a bonus! The stealing area for brunch was nice, almost like a decked out glass gardening area. The portions are decently sized and will be filling. The Berger alone will cost you about $25. The mimosa are a great pairing, would go back again for brunch!",0,0,1,Juliana J.,"New York, NY",262,75,43

4.0,4/10/2019,"Review for happy hour only! Small, narrow bar but didn't take away from the happy hour! 2 for 1 drinks 4-8 PER PERSON! So you can't order 2 drinks and share with a friend or date. They are very emphatic that you buy for yourself and don't share. It used to be dollar oysters but now it's half price oysters. So not nearly as good a deal as many places have dollar oysters. Some of the oysters were 4$/each really not that great of a deal even for happy hour. Ordered some other apps including the Brussels sprouts, rice balls, and crab appetizer. Brussels sprouts were good... The other stuff was very fried and only fair. Anyway still a good bar and a good happy hour",0,0,0,Dave G.,"New York, NY",68,251,0

They will not protect you or stand up for you when you are harassed.Tonight I went for happy hour and was told it was two for one, I didn't understand that meant just for one person drinking, nevertheless I got my bill and it was for two drinks. So I paid for both with a large bill, they gave me my change in all 1s and I said ""can you please change this you're making me feel like a stripper"" another guy said ""you are."" (Wtf that's a dumb one) then another guy asked ""is that your biggest concern?""They gave me bigger bills and I left, and immediately realized I'd forgotten to tip and came back to tip. When I did another patron said I was a bad tipper and a ""classless cu*t"" and told me to leave. I was so angry and was trying to leave. He called me a ""cu*t"" several more times before I left.

Came here for restaurant week and was not disappointed.  The gal and I split a salad, as well as the steak and rigatoni for dinner.  All were fantastic.  We did the wine pairings and I think that was worth it.  Pro tip:  Their dry, white, house wine is awesome and cheap!",0,0,0,Andrew J.,"Manhattan, NY",1,21,0
4.0,2/3/2019,"For restaurant week I came here for dinner with three friends. This restaurant is a good go to spot to take a group of people because their menu is the same for restaurant week. Service was ok but efficient. The glass of water I had had a lipstick stain on it so I got a new glass, server was not happy. Our server was knowledgeable but appeared annoyed due to asking a lot of questions, but came around after I ordered a mocktail and glass of Pinoy Gris. So for food, I ordered a mocktail: Paul Hogan, which was good and refreshing. For my three course meal, I ordered the roasted beet salad. The salad was definitely colorful just as our server described and it was tasty and refreshing. Next I ordered the barramundi which was both popular and highly recommended by our server.  The dish was roasted perfectly crispy and mixed with vegetables it had a great balance of flavors. The dish compliment well with the Pinor Gris from Australia. Finally for the dessert I had to have the bread pudding which was so good and a perfect end to this dessert.  I would return to have brunch because the back area of the restaurant had a awesome sunroof.",0,0,0,Chris P.,"ELMHURST, NY",91,53,182
5.0,1/31/2019,"I went here for the first time tonight for Restaurant Week, and was not disappointed. There was nothing I disliked about this place. I felt well cared for the minute I stepped in. The hostess is gracious (and the complimentary coat check is great!). The mood warm--it is a super inviting place w a slightly rustic feel, dim lighting. The small dining room roof is a skylight, and the intimate mood continues. Service was ace. Their Restaurant Week (RW) menu is basically their dinner menu! And their non-RW items are reasonable for a restaurant of this level. We started w some drinks: I had the Better Come Home (or something like that: vodka, Thai basil, lemon, rhubarb bitters) and my partner had a stout. My drink was well-made n delish; the stout was smooth n chocolately. I ordered the stracciatella toast (mmmm w lemon and sprouts), barramundi and toffee bread pudding. We shared some non-RW week oysters and truffle polenta. My partner got the kangaroo burger which was simple (the meat is the star) and delicious. This place is fancy but not fussy, which is fitting for an Australian restaurant: beautiful and understated.",1,1,1,Clarissa S.,"Brooklyn, NY",34,20,7

4.0,1/30/2019,"While searching for restaurant week spots I came across this restaurant and figured I'd try it out. I hadn't had Australian oriented cuisine since I was last in Melbourne. As with most other restaurants participating in restaurant week, the pre-fix course was 42$. With wine pairing it was $69 or roughly 9$ a glass. I had the parsnip soup as an appetizer, lamb ragu as my main, and the brownie ice cream with espresso as my dessert. Food quality and proportions were good. If I had to return I'd probably try something a little more uncommon such as the kangaroo burger. The wine pairings were great, but the dessert wine was a little too sweet for my taste, especially pairing with the ice cream. Our server was knowledgeable. Overall a good pick for restaurant week if you are in the area.",3,1,3,Nickey L.,"Brooklyn, NY",286,100,168

5.0,1/24/2019,"Burke & Wills is one of my favorite Australian Bistros on the Upper West Side. It's a combination of formal dining elegance & casual happy hour appetizers & drinks bar service. My favorite time is between 4-8 PM where cocktails are 2 for one & the oysters flow at a discount. You can choose from Bluepoint, Beau Soleil & Capitals on ice with quartered lemons & light spicy sauce or combine all 3 in one chilled platter by the 1/2 doz. to several doz. The service is quick, the staff is upbeat & friendly. The appetizers & entrees are creative & delicious. You can eat your entrees in the formal dining room or at the bar. The ambience is traditional, dark & dim lit but inviting & comfortable. The music ranges 70's to the present, R&B, Club, Rick, Pop. The one thing I will miss immensely is the happy hour DJ. She played some incredible club music in a faux record lined DJ booth. The booth has since been removed & the bar extended. There's also an upstairs dining room in this townhouse building. This Bistro is definitely worth checking out.",1,0,0,Yvette G.,"Bronx, Bronx, NY",1,16,465
5.0,1/21/2019,"I'm a big fan.  Dined here after a Lincoln Center performance.   You enter down a few stairs into a very narrow space, first the rocking bar and the quieter dining space In back.    I'm impressed with the intimate environment, great Aussie food and clever cocktail menu.   Love that the wines by the glass are all Australian.  I had the kangaroo burger - likely most popular and it was very tasty.    My partner had barramundi and loved it.  Started with oysters a la carte which is also popular. I'm a downtown guy who rarely eats in the UWS but I feel like I must tell my friends about this ""find""!  Only thing I would caution is not to reserve too late.  We were a 10:30pm reservation and by the end of our meal, we were the only table at just before midnight.",0,0,0,Doug J.,"New York, NY",6,39,8

On my second visit here, I had dinner downstairs and decided to go with what else - the kangaroo burger. It was interesting - tasted like a normal burger except it seemed to sit a bit heavier in my stomach, maybe my stomach is not used to eating such things.I had pangs of guilt as I tried not to imagine a cute kangaroo had died to make this burger. The brussels sprouts app was delicious. I had a great port for dessert - it was the Tawny - get it, I highly recommend it. Service was good.

3.0,11/23/2018,"I came her for thanksgiving dinner when they were serving there pre-fixed thanksgiving menu. I ordered the butternut squash soup which was really good. For my main course I opted for the ravioli which in my opinion fell short. The ravioli seemed a bit over cooked and not like homemade ravioli. I did like the fried sage on top. The potato purée was not light and fluffy like I would expect it to be. The wine I ordered was amazing! I ordered the house dry white and it did not disappoint.... for desert I tried both the pecan pie and the beignets. They were both very good but not something I would go Out of my way for. The ""Kylie Monogue"" drink is notWorth it and didn't taste refreshing I would stick to just wine......Maybe during there regular menu the food is a home run? Seeing boxed ravioli on my way out through the kitchen window proved my point. Ambiance is super cute and service is exceptional but the food just didn't hit the spot.

5.0,11/16/2018,"This bar/restaurant is just steps from the 79th Street Metro stop (local 1 line) and a definite go-to if you're in the area.  Happy Hour is 4-8pm during the week and offers 2-for-1 drinks and oysters.  The drinks here are on the expensive side, average is about $15 for a cocktail or glass or wine, so the 2-for-1 makes a big difference in your tab at the end of the night.  We got the risotto croquettes ($7), served with three on the small plate, and oysters at the bar which were delicious.  The heavy fried exterior made it less like a traditional potato croquette, and the inside was warm risotto with corn and served over a tomato-cream sauce.  The bartenders are extremely knowledgeable about all of the different cocktails and mix up some really beautiful, tasty drinks.Important to note, the bar is cash-only for drinks and food.",0,0,0,Gianna S.,"New York, NY",4,25,15
4.0,10/29/2018,"A friend and I came here for dinner and drinks on a weeknight and sat at the bar. The space is really nice and the vibe is classy yet relaxed.I had a couple dirty gin martinis and they were some of the smoothest, most delicious martinis I've ever had. I also tried one of their signature cocktails, a bourbon drink called red right hand. It was strong yet fruity which is my favorite type of whiskey drink. The bartenders definitely know what they're doing. I really wanted to try the kangaroo burger and it did not disappoint... it reminded me quite a bit of beef and was juicy and flavorful. The thick, hand cut fries it comes with are also good. I definitely would like to try more from the menu and would also like to try their brunch.",0,0,1,Holly S.,"Riverdale, Bronx, NY",114,163,122
5.0,10/20/2018,"Had the beef tartare and pork belly fritters for appetizers.  The former was a tad salty and cumbersome to eat with the accompanying chips.  The latter were small but rife with tender meat.  The hanger steak was sublime and cooked to perfection; the accompanying sauce balanced it well and the salad was a welcome contrast to the meat.  The kangaroo burger was lean but excellent at the recommended medium rare.  Pavlova was crunchy and interesting, as the contents stuck to the teeth after chewing.  Affogato was great as the brownie had a nice warmth against the backdrop of the gelato.  Service was super attentive and kind while the environment was classy, with photographs from Australia adorning the wall.  Overall a pleasant dining experience.",0,0,0,Ken W.,"Forest Hills, NY",27,234,810

5.0,9/4/2018,"If you're an adventurous eater, you have to come here to try their kangaroo burger! It tasted like a more lean beef to me; a little more gamy and a little less juicy than a beef patty. It was delicious! It costs around $16, which I thought was pretty standard for a burger in the city. We also ordered the beef tartar as an appetizer and a few cocktails from the menu, which were all delicious. The beef tar tar was served with chips, which I thought was too delicate to hold.

5.0,8/17/2018,"I went here for restaurant week with two of my friends on a Wednesday night. We walked through a dim, romantic bar to a naturally lit, cool dining room with chic decorations that were in theme with the Australian menu. Our waiter was absolutely charming - he did an excellent job explaining the wines and the menus and was extremely attentive throughout the entire meal. When we looked at the menu, we were delighted to see that the entire menu was offered as part of the restaurant week selection. I had the crispy brussel sprouts, hangar steak, and bread pudding. I loved the crispy brussel sprouts - they were fried and seasoned to perfection. The hangar steak was on the small side (but it is restaurant week after all), and while I could have definitely eaten more I was very pleased with the cook and the sauce underneath. My companions also tried the burrata, chilled tomato soup, cavatelli, and the affogato. The cavatelli had a great pesto sauce that made it really flavorful. We also tried a few glasses of the wine (also from Australia!) and a bourbon. We enjoyed the selection and appreciated the explanations from our waiter! Overall, we had a really lovely experience from beginning to end. The food and wine were delicious, the decor was eclectic but intimate, and the service was really excellent.

4.0,7/30/2018,"Oh goodness....I really hate to start this review on a negative note so I will start by saying the wonderful message I received from one of the owners of Burke & Wills the following day after my visit. Heathe called and left a lengthy voicemail on my phone apologizing for the service and experience we received during our dining and explained the struggles of recent renovations from a neighboring company that contributed to the infestation. He invited me to re-visit them for a bug-free experience on the house. He also followed up with a text message to my phone, which I have yet to reply. Although a nice gesture, and quite generous I am not sure how to re-do a birthday celebration and not sure if I want to share my dinner with bugs again. My friend believes we should have left, but I was adamant about completing the experience confident that it could only get better if we gave it a chance. What was to be a care-free girls' night turned out to be a pest-y annoyance. Ideally, it would have been cheaper to comp the entire meal on the day of our dining rather than try to offer damage control the day after. I appreciate the offer wholeheartedly and would like to give them the benefit of the doubt because the 2 hostesses up front were so nice in helping us take pictures and chatting with us as we waited to be seated, and the food was quite delicious. To be fair, the waitress tried to explain the kangaroo burger to my friend. But did nothing to find out about the chicken on their limited menu. My friend was also interested in their happy hour (BOGO) for drinks and our waiter gave my friend the wrong info....which made my friend abruptly call her out and make a dive to the bar to bring the drinks back to our table. As I was waiting, a nearby table received their desserts and attracted a nest of bugs. They were very disturbed, so they were swatting the bugs. Since the tables are very closely seated, many of the bugs flew over to me. They landed on my lap, on my chest, in my hair and on my arms. My friend brought this up to our waiter who dismissed this as fruit flies and its just a one off thing. This was before we placed our food, but as the night progressed, my friend started saving the bugs on a napkin until it covered the entire square. I was very bothered, but wanted to remain as a calm and collected date. OMG...I must have excused myself to the WC to wash down my arms and face because psychologically I was itching ALL over. Luckily we were offered a bar stool upstairs when it cleared up and was informed once the food came out she would bring it upstairs. I ordered the Baby Kale salad, Hanger Steak, and 3 cheese platter while my friend ordered the Beef Tartare, Branzino and affogato. The food arrived over an hour and a half after we entered the restaurant, and my friend was becoming HANGRY....she actually ended up LICKING her plate in defiance. Our reservation was 7PM and our bill came after 9:30PM.One of our drinks was mixed poorly and I didn't want to mention it up but since our water was never refilled for the duration of our meal, my friend decides to ask our waiter to switch it out when she finally came by our table to remove our plates. Our waitress was reluctant and almost rude. She did switch out our drink with some hassle which irked my buddy a bit more. It was my friend's birthday, and I was caught in a rough spot. My friend was dead set on paying our bill and nothing more...only finally budging to allow me to enter exactly 15%. I was embarrassed, felt bad but also agreed we weren't at fault. I observed the waitress seemingly frazzled tending to our table and her tables downstairs so she was reaching her boiling point and it rubbed off on the service. The rudeness factor received by the waitress wasn't too hot, I would be concerned to re-visit. Other guests were also moved upstairs and I suspect it had to do with the flying bugs upon overhearing their grievances. We met some guys waiting for a table and ended up sharing ours and enjoying our meals together. Nice meeting you guys....but it didn't make up for the bugs.All in all, I gave 4 stars because it takes a lot to call up a guest after the fact to acknowledge an awful dining experience and offer amends. I believe the waitress could have handled the situation better (with a more positive attitude) but perhaps it was an off day for the entire crew.",3,5,3,Jane Y.,"Fresh Meadows, Queens, NY",431,221,2136

Matilda at Burke & Wills was an absolute pleasure to work with and put thought into every last detail. She suggested having champagne glasses for guests as they arrive, gave us recommendations for menu items, helped us play a slideshow, timed our speeches, and even found a place for us to charge our camera when it died. Would HIGHLY recommend!

5.0,5/12/2018,"I'm Australian, and live in the area, so imagine my delight when I came across this little spot almost hidden away. The restaurant itself is split into two parts, and has two very different vibes. The bar area (at the front) is a low-lit brick and wood kind of deal, super casual, with amazing deals during the week (Their 2-for-1 happy hour cannot be beat!) The back is a little more airy, with a beautiful glass ceiling (perfect for brunch!) and some lovely pictures lining the walls, all harking back to the Australian days of yore. It's classy-casual, great for a business lunch, but equally as fine if you just want to catch up with some friends in an intimate environment. (You don't have to shout to be heard, definitely a plus!) The food and drinks are fantastic! I've had both the kangaroo burger (for dinner) and the pork belly eggs Benedict (for lunch) (my god, it was so delicious, my mouth is watering just thinking about it now.)

4.0,4/4/2018,"Excellent Happy Hour. As many people stated already, the deal for HH on cocktails is Buy One, Get One Free for You. You cannot go with a friend, order a cocktail and have your friend get the free one. Not a problem for F and I as we never stop at one cocktail (we ended up having 4 each), but just a heads up. I ordered all the cocktails off the menu and thought they were well made. F ordered 2 off the menu and asked for bartender's choice on the other 2 and she was happy with what she got as well. The dollar oyster deal is for Blue Point oysters, which is pretty standard as far as $1 oyster deals go. It is served with a mignonette. Kinda weird that you have to ask for cocktail sauce and Tabasco sauce (which they do not have), but no biggie as you're sitting at the bar anyway and it's an easy ask. We also tried the cheese beignets which I liked and the pork rilette fritters which is like a fried pork meatball. We also ordered the fried chicken sandwich. (Drinking gives us the munchies.) I'd definitely go back for the HH again as it goes to 8PM.

4.0,3/17/2018,"My friend used to live in Australia, so I suggested that we have dinner here for nostalgic reasons. The atmosphere was extremely UWS. Like, you could not accuse this place of existing anywhere else in the city, except perhaps 20 blocks south in the Lincoln Center area. We dined in the main room in the back, which was aesthetically very nice... but the addition of the jazz music made it just a taaaaaaad stuffy. Just a tad. The vibe at and around the bar area seemed a little more laid-back. Our waiter had a good sweet'n'sassy thing going on, so kudos to him for lightening things up a bit. We ordered:-Sea scallops (plate of two; green curry, herb salad, crispy shallots) - Phenoms, the both of them. These were giant, cooked to absolute tender perfection, and very nicely charred. There was a nice herby, slightly spicy sauce, but it wasn't even really necessary. If we had decided to just get like 5 orders of these and call it a night, I would not have minded. -Roasted Duck Breast (napa cabbage, roasted mushrooms, jus) - Undoubtedly, this little guy was cooked with care and expertise. The added jus made it all very succulent and flavorful. The mushrooms were a nice addition both for their texture and rather subtle flavor. The salty skin of the duck was a bit much for my liking. All in all, this was a very nicely prepared dish that was ever-so-slightly-boring. -Butternut squash risotto - This was my friend's order, and I only had 2 bites, but it was very good and cooked perfectly, which his hard to do for risotto! Got some cocktails, too:Red right hand: a take on a whiskey sour, with a playful shiraz float! The wine added some sweetness to this citrus-centric whiskey cocktail. No complaints about this one, although later into the drink, after most of the shiraz was gone, it got a bit sour for me.Are you gonna be my girl (Beluga Noble Russian Vodka, King's Ginger Liqueur, Apple Cider, Cinnamon, Lemon): Kinda a riff on a Moscow Mule. It was lemony rather than limey. Was light and refreshing.Overall, I'd give it a solid 3.5, rounded up for the high quality of the food and also for those scallops.",5,3,5,Laura O.,"Manhattan, NY",341,548,34

My partner has the kangaroo burger, I couldn't eat beef myself, but he told me that the meat texture kind of like very lean pork, and he couldn't really describe the taste of it. Overall it was delicious and interesting experience in trying kangaroo burger. The non alcoholic cocktail, Paul Hogan, has a strong ginger ale flavor, with the real ginger-spicy taste. For dessert, I had passion fruit mix berries pavlova.

5.0,2/25/2018,"Okay so I haven't been writing Yelp Reviews for a while, but now I'm back because this place is waaay to good not to share. Burke & Wills is an Australian-themed restaurant. I'm not Australian, nor have I been to Australia. However, I think you know a restaurant is authentic when not one, but TWO Australian families are sitting on either side of you. Apparently, it's so Australian that even Aussie's are into it.I came for brunch today on a rainy Sunday afternoon. The place was not crowded, but definitely had some happy brunchers. The front space, a cozy, dimly-lit bar with some high tops, had quite a few people. The seating in the back is like a cozy greenhouse with a sky-lit roof, 1940s Australian decor, and white-tableclothed tables. The host, bartenders, and servers are all dressed sharply and are incredibly friendly hospitible.The brunch menu was great- a good selection of options for me (the vegetarian) and for my beau (the carnivore). He had a kangaroo (!) burger! I had the lox benedict (okay, fine, I'm pescatarian). Both were delicious, filling portions. I had coffee, which was constantly kept full by our server. Beau had a Pimms Cup (so hard to find in the US) and it was so light and refreshing. We decided to treat ourselves with donuts for desert and they... were... awesome.

They also serve bar snacks and you can order from the full dinner menu as well.I got the seasonal warm drink (so sweet w/ a pineapple cream on top) and the Into temptation. The seasonal drink was definitely on the sweet side and quite dangerous since it masks the alcohol. My second drink was a nice bubbly and refreshing drink. We also ordered kangaroo burger and salmon tartare. Honestly, I had no idea what to expect and it was great. The meat is quite rare (they didn't ask how we wanted it cooked) which is perfectly fine with me. It wasn't as game-y as I had assumed. Bison has a more game-y taste than kangaroo. It also wasn't fatty which is great. I always feel so full and greasy after eating a regular burger. The toppings were sweet and pickled so that added some delicious contrast to the meat. Salmon tartare was on the smaller side, but a good light start to dinner.Such a great place with friendly service and delicious food.

I loved the soft vintage jazz music in the background. The lights were dimly lit and fresh candles on the table. The servers are dressed in the same 1920s feel.  I found the service to be spectacular!! They are so attentive and knowledgable. Our server was able to pair our drinks perfectly with the meal.  B & W also has an extensive wine menu.  The food menu has small plates (i.e., appetizers) and large plates (i.e., entrees). The menu items are diverse and interesting. I loved that you could get varied meat dishes like duck breast and kangaroo.  We started with the duck breast, pork belly, and brussels sprouts. The duck was cooked perfectly with a nice crust. The pork belly was plentiful and had nice salt.  The brussels sprouts had a nice smoke flavor to them. We were treated to a round of peconic bay scallops. I loved that they are locally sourced and very tasty. My entree was the branzino. Others enjoyed the roasted chicken and Kangaroo burger. The branzino had a nice crust and an asian flavor (I substituted frisee for arugula).  Delicious!!  I also liked the taste of the kangaroo, and the chips with sauce was delightful. We ended the evening with freshly baked doughnuts with dulce de leche and nutella.  Amazing!!! I've always heard that Burke & Wills is a great place to get drinks, but never imagined how spectacular the food would be. I highly recommend!!

About the food. I can only speak for my orders. For appetizer, we shared crab cakes. Very creamy, like other crab cakes. I liked it a lot, but it was really rare to fail on it. First course I chose scallop with bamboo shoots. The scallops were delicious and soft, although one or two of them were a bit over-fried. However, they were too salty and too many bamboo shoots (not much flavor) compared to the scallops. For the main, I went with Kangaroo Burger. I've never had kangaroo meat, so I don't know if it is authentic. But It was tasty and meaty full of meet juice, yet not stinky. It was like ""yes, I am eating meat"", so I doubt that everyone would like it though. The fries that came with the burger were huuuge! Really giant fires that I was like eating the whole potato itself. But because of this, it enriched the texture and I could taste slightly sweetness from the potato. I prefer to eat it directly without the sauce, but the sauce was spicy and delicious too like chipotle. The afogato was good and had strong espresso flavor.

1.0,9/2/2017,"Straight up, the worst restaurant I've ever been to. I've never left a Yelp review before, but this experience was so terrible it felt like I should. Firstly, the meat wasn't seasoned and flavorless and bacon was dry and practically like chips. The place was completely empt, which makes sense. The waitress gave us the food, but then disappeared. Had to walk to the front to find her, where she was on her phone just scrolling through her Instagram. I had the food taken back and was brought something else, however was charged for everything ordered, which was nuts. By the time the new dish was ready, everyone else had already completely finished their food and just asked for the food to good (had it later and it was equally terrible). There was no host or manager around either to talk to; the place was a ghost town, and for good reason. This was the worst restaurant and I can't understand why it has a good Yelp rating. DEFINITELY DO NOT GO HERE.Yelp doesn't allow for a public reply to the owner's public comment, so will just add on here. First of all, I never suggested I'd bring in a drink. I asked my girlfriend (not anyone in the restaurant) if she wanted to get coffee next door first or simply get coffee at the restaurant before you rudely and condescendingly interjected with the obvious statement that outside food and drinks aren't allowed. Secondly, I took two bites of the Eggs Benedict. One was the first bite and the second was to confirm that the first bite was terrible. (I may have had my girlfriend take a bite to confirm it was me, but that's the extent of it). I then sat there and waited for ten minutes before getting up and literally walking up front to the bar area, where the waitress was on her cell phone looking at Instagram - which is something I saw with my own two eyes. If the waitress was taking a reservation there wouldn't be much cause for complaint - that's just someone doing their job - but she was on Instagram. I had to get her attention and she immediately followed me to my table and put away her phone, so certainly not taking a reservation. It's hardly obnoxious to be disappointed by bad food and upset by poor service, and there's certainly nothing else obnoxious you could point towards (though, at this point, it sure wouldn't surprise me if you were to make something else up). Lastly, for anyone curious about what I'm talking about with this place, literally just read the owner/bartender's response and the manor in which he speaks and conducts himself (as the owner and representative of a restaurant/place of hospitality) and I think that's a fair representation of what I experienced while there. Buddy, in case you didn't read the review, I'm not planning on returning. In fact, I'm recommending others skip it altogether (even more so now following your response and continued conduct).

Perfect combo of warm brownie, ice cream and espresso!I tried the kangaroo burger even though it pained me to eat a kangaroo.

Even at the peak of day, it isn't too much sunlight where you would get annoyed. It's a bit small in terms of occupancy, but even when it was full everybody had space. Starter: Braised octopusSauce really compliments the tenderness of the octopus. Really the sauce was amazing. The accents of the pepper also added a certain crispness, very fresh. I feel that the sausage was slightly misplaced. It was like an added detail, I kinda wished instead of soaking with the sauce, octopus, and peppers that it was smoked/baked/whatever and added later so it has a greater presence. Main course: kangaroo burger I got really excited about the burger, but in thr end the experience was really underwhelming. The kangaroo meat seemed to be masked by the tomato-like puree. What really didn't help was that the kangaroo meat (medium rare) was almost the consistency of the tomato, so it was difficult to tell without looking what you were eating. In addition, it was a tad bit salty, but that might be because of the fries. Dessert: Affogato This was recommended by the server and she was right, it is delicious! It starts out with some (vanilla with nuts?) Ice cream and 2 brownie bars in a cup, and they pour espresso on top. The combination of the ice cream and espresso is amazing!! The brownie was alright, but the main focus really was the ice cream and espresso. Overall: It was a wonderful experience (despite the burger) and I'll be sure to go back again.",0,0,0,Erin-marie P D.,"Manhattan, NY",0,25,20

5.0,7/24/2017,"Came here for RW dinner and had a splendid evening. Peter, our waiter, was super attentive and gave us plenty of time to decide what to order. Plus he informed us on the appetizer serving sizes to help our table of 3.The shrimp app comes with 4 large delicious shrimps plus cocktail sauce, all over a bed of ice. Excellent starter option. We also enjoyed a side of fries with a tasty aioli dip. The crisp and thickness were amazing. Sadly, crab claws were out tonight, so it'll be for next time. For entrees, we got the salmon with watermelon gazpacho dish and a house made fettuccine with a parmesan crisp. The salmon texture and crispy skin was phenomenal, plus the gazpacho was so refreshing. The watermelon cubes absorbed so much flavor. The fettuccine has such a wonderful corn sweetness coupled with cubes of fine ham, an excellent choice too. Finally, dessert was affogato with brownie slices and am order of fresh donuts. Affogatos were delectable, though we wish the Gelato mixed more with the espresso shot (which you pour yourself, fun!). Donuts were ok, comes with 2 dipping sauces. Throughout dinner, Peter and his staff mates were exceptionally attentive. Checked up on us, refilled waters, took away finished plates, and paced our dishes too to avoid table clutter. Service is a solid A+!

Although the dining room in the restaurant at the back is charming, with a glass solarium that allows you to hear the pitter patter of rain while you eat, the menu leaves something to be desired. And it isn't cheap and in some cases menu items are misleadingly advertised. E.g. My family of 4 decided to order a few dishes to share, for one of the entrees we selected the rack of lamb. What would you think when you order a RACK of lamb?  Dictionary definition (for you Burke & Wills): a large piece of meat from a sheep, cow, or pig that consists of its chest and ribs.  We got two chops!  That's ridiculous at $46.

I'm pretty sure 90% of the table ordered the grapefruit and yogurt (myself included!) and the other 10%, avocado toast. Amongst us we had a few sides of bacon, potatoes, pastries, and donuts. I could truly sit here for half an hour raving about the grapefruit and yogurt, but I won't. JUST GO. Go get it. You will not regret it. It's wonderful and delicious. But. there is one downfall, hence the reason for my four stars. They don't have serrated spoons for the grapefruit. It was delicious so I will look past it, but it would be so much easier to eat with the proper utensils. Maybe next time I'll bring my own. I typically don't eat sugar but you better believe I'll be back for more. The potatoes were good, nothing out of this world. I didn't try anything else but everyone was loving it.

4.0,10/2/2016,"Went here to celebrate a birthday. As part of the reservation, dessert was preordered so that the wait staff could bring it out as soon as dinner was finished.  The ambience is nice. The decor gives a feeling of being surrounded by wilderness rather than towering skyscrapers. The noise level was good, allowing for private conversation without the yelling.  We started with the thrice-fried chips (French fries for Murkin's).  They came with a harissa aioli that tasted suspiciously like a buffalo sauce-mayo mixture.  Not, that it wasn't tasty. In fact, it was delicious. For our main courses, I had the salmon over heirloom beans, kalamata olives, and a lemon Mage sauce.  My dining partner had the papperdelle which was served with charred corn and cherry tomatoes.  They let your choose the doneness of the salmon which is nice because you can avoid an overcooked, dried-out mess or hot sushi in favor of a perfectly cooked filet, crispy on the outside while moist and tender inside. The sauce was rich but, added a nice dimension to keep an old standby interesting.  The papperdelle, which I tried, was fantastic. The pasta was cooked to perfection and the sauce was just sweet enough to be noticed while not overpowering the centerpiece of the dish which was complimented by the slight crunch of the charred corn and mild tartness of the tomatoes.  We shared a side of Brussels sprouts which were above average but, not spectacular.  We paired a Riesling with our entrees. Dessert was brought out immediately after we finished our meals, as planned. We had the warm chocolate cake with a vanilla gelato and berries, and a pavlova with passion fruit curd, berries, and cream. The chocolate cake was fantastic. Light with deep flavor. The gelato obviously made in-house. The pavlova while pleasant to taste could never compare to that offered by Dominique Ansel. I say this because I am not a fan of the hard merengue produced when loads of sugar are added prior to cooking it. I prefer my merengue light and fluffy like you get with a lemon merengue pie. Good food, good atmosphere, and great service. I would definitely return and recommend this place.",0,0,0,Tim H.,"Queens, NY",0,6,4

4.0,9/18/2016,"4.5 stars. Australian food is in right now. No, I should clarify: Australian *cafes* are in right now. I need to note the difference outright here, because I don't want any misled consumers coming to Burke & Wills hoping for a cute, airy cafe filled avocado toast and nothing else (they do have avo toast on the brunch menu though, so don't fret). My reason for saying all of this is because when New Yorkers think ""Australian food"", they most likely think of Bluestone Lane and El Rey (both famous for their avo toast). So there's Australian food and there's Australian cafe culture (you will only find kangaroo meat associated with one of these things). Burke & Wills is a full blown, fine dining Australian restaurant. No vegemite though.Walked in here for a late-ish dinner and managed to score a table in the back room. I'd suggest making a reservation, though. We were initially slammed with an hour-long wait and just got lucky. Initially we thought we were sitting at the bar, which was nice simply from an observational prospective. While the bar area is somewhat casual and industrial, the main dining room is brighter and more elegant. Simplistic, classy decor and a beautiful skylight to round it all out. Perfect for a date or when your parents are in town (and they're paying, obviously).Though many of you already know this, Burke & Wills is also home to the crown jewel of all things liquor on the Upper West Side, Manhattan Cricket Club. All I'll say on this is that you absolutely *must* venture upstairs after your meal here and order an expertly-crafted cocktail from Cory, the head bartender/alcohol wizard. That said, Burke & Wills has some pretty fine cocktail offerings as well. I wanted to save myself for the magic upstairs but I always need to do my due diligence and order a cocktail with dinner (only if the menu is appealing, of course). Though I'm not a vodka fan, I made an exception for the Better Be Home Soon (VDKA 6100, Rhubarb Bitters, Thai Basil Syrup, Lemon). Too interesting to pass up. And as it turns out, my intuition led me in a great direction--super yummy and herbaceous, not too sweet, definitely worth it. Roasted Scallops w/ foie mousse, kiwi berries, hazelnut puree: AThis might sound uber pretentious but just take it at face value: of all the shellfish out there, scallops have typically been pretty meh for me. Mussels and oysters 'til I die. But scallops have grown on me in the past few years and preparations such as this lovely one are the reason why. The scallops were cooked beautifully and the accompaniments were thoughtful and seriously yummy. Rich but not overpowering. And yes, kiwi berries are a real thing and they are delicious.Roasted Kangaroo Loin w/ horseradish foam, caperberries: A-C'mon guys, I had to. I don't like the idea of eating kangaroo but I pride myself in being 100% adventurous when I eat, so this was necessary. I know absolutely nothing about how kangaroo meat is supposed to be cooked/prepared, but I certainly enjoyed it. The garnishes were pretty minimal here, which I appreciated. Kangaroo is probably a very new thing for most people who try it here, so I'm happy there wasn't anything detracting my attention from the main flavor. Striped Bass: A+Man, I wish this was on the website so I could tell you what exactly composed this dish, other than the bass. Regardless of the inidivudal components, the dish as a whole was sublime. I'm a big fan of bass and this seriously hit the spot. The fish was cooked perfectly and was sitting in some magical creamy--but light--sauce. I also remember the capers in this dish, which are typically a safe pairing with fish--definitely worked with the overall flavor profile. Of everything we ordered, I'd say this was the highlight of the meal. Asparagus: BKinda lame and kinda greasy. We wanted some sort of veggie along with our proteins and we both like asparagus, so this seemed like a natural choice. I'd pass on them if I were you. However, if you have a hankering for asparagus and are trying to save money and are trying to only eat vegetables because you're boring, you could honestly make this plate an entree. So many spears (see photo)! For dessert, we tried the Warm Chocolate Cake. I don't have much to say on this since I typically abstain from sugar (and I've never been the biggest fan of chocolate cake as far as desserts go--please don't shoot me for this), but the gelato/candied nuts on the side were super yummy and decadent. Worth considering.Note on service: Though our waitress was delightful and the definition of hospitable, our food took a painfully long time to come out. It took 30 minutes just to get our bread. While I understand that kitchens get backed up, some things are inexcusable. It all ended on a fantastic note though: at the end of the meal our waitress secured two seats at the bar upstairs for us and made sure there was a hostess a available to escort us up.

The char came with small chunks of watermelon.  It was good but if you're making a choice between the two, go with the scallops. We both had the kangaroo burger which is also seasoned but I don't know that it's worth all the hype. It's very juicy/oily so wear dark colors or a strategically placed napkin to safeguard your clothes. The fries were a disappointment. The beignets with Nutella were good. The ice cream with brownie was classic and simple.  We skipped the expresso pour over as it was delivered in a cracked vessel and we're not big on expresso in our ice cream.  I added a glass of wine on to the meal for $6- it was a very small pour. While I can't say I'm raving about the food,  I'm intrigued about their happy hour/ oysters so I may read other reviews and return.

4.0,8/22/2016,"It was a Thursday night of restaurant week in the summer of 2016.My friends and I were escorted to the back of the restaurant that was lit by the natural light of the setting sun from the transparent window paned rooftop. The atmosphere was very classy with framed pictures of anything relevant to Australia. Classy comfy cushioned benches ran along the walls. Service was prompt and generous. It was my friends birthday and I had shared this information with my server. To our surprise we were presented with a free shot of their special cocktail. Also as for dessert they had planted a candle for the birthday girl. Quite generous and kind indeed.For appetizers, we all choose the scallops with foie grad stuffed cherries. It was the only most appealing app in their set menu besides the chilled corn soup. The dish arrived with just 3 scallops in a ginormous white clean plate. Do not be fooled by the portion! Every bite of the scallops were simply divinely delicious!Entrees; the lamp chops were cooked well done when I had asked for medium. Nonetheless the meat was still tender and flavorful. The kangaroo burger is a bit of a mystery because I have nothing to compare it with. It was my first time having kangaroo meat. All I can say it was lean, no fat whatsoever. The flavor was unique and worth trying if you are adventurous.Dessert; the vanilla ice cream with brownie and espresso was pretty good. The cheeses on the cheese plate are very sharp. I don't understand what the blob of caramel in the middle of the plate is for. The doughnuts were very delicious. No filling inside. Just dip it in nutella and be on your way.Overall, a great meal and time! Only thing is it is a bit of a travel to the Upper West Side.",0,0,1,Amy Y.,"New York, NY",30,107,394

5.0,7/24/2016,"Yes! The full evil penal colony experience at an Australian colonial watering hole!How is it Australian? Feel like thieves! Wait, that was NOT the INXS song. This place will truly do its best to make you feel like a thief unless you walk in with a certain ""privilege"". I kid you not. They even have African Americans in the DJ cage (DJs please find work elsewhere!), no doubt, to give you the full Australian experience. They have a masala drink on the menu that's ripped-off of a drink you get at classy Mumbai rooftop lounge. Is that colonial enough for you?Now what specific thievery experience can you earn with your hard earned cash? I walked in one late evening and ordered a late night non alcoholic $6 drink. I had been there a few times so one of the two bartenders not serving me recognizes me. Done with my 'drink', I spend a lot of time sitting with an empty glass at a not-very-busy-bar trying to get the bartender's attention so that I can pay up. I finally put down the cash + tip on the bar hoping that will catch someone's attention. Thankfully, the other bartender I know walks by and picks up the cash.So far it's only a slightly mismanaged bar at a not-busy hour.Now, I get up to leave, and the bartender who served me comes to life and calls out me from across the bar that I've not paid. Nicely done, mate, that's how you call out thieving customers who run away with $6 non alcoholic drinks in their belly.I tell him that I've paid and ask him to check with the other bartender. At this point this bartender just stands there looking at me with furrowed brows as if he is trying to figure out if he should call the police. Clearly, he would like to give me the full penal colony experience. I shrug- not only am I wasting more time late at night thanks to a mismanaged bar, but I am also a bar prop till this bartender can figure this out. A couple of minutes go by and the bartender is still dawdling at the bar. Then, he just stands by the cash register. I now ask the bartender to figure this out quickly. He comes over to have word with me like I'm stealing from the bar. Back at the bar, I tell him that I don't have all night to be standing there. He leans over, puts his hand on my jacket arm and menacingly asks me to cool it. Wow, you are at his service now.Are you feeling like a $6 non alcoholic drink thief yet?I look around the bar for the bartender I know, call him over and explain the situation to him. He talks to the bartender serving me and- wow- now the two of them are spending time looking into the tip jar. I'm gaping at this, rooted to my spot.Is that ridiculously Kafkaesque-ly Marx brothers enough for you already?It had been another 5 minutes and at this point. I am still waiting there to resolve this. At this point I ask for the manager. The bartender I know briefs the manager (in my direct line of sight). The manager comes over with a force smile on his face, with an expression that says what could I possibly be upset about? He then proceeds to put his arm around my shoulder.I explain what's transpired. I ask him what bartending book teaches this behavior. No apology yet. He then proceeds to tell me that the bartender is a good guy. I considered asking him if that was because he seemed to feel the need to shake to a Michael Jackson number playing at that time?I bluntly ask the manager that if he would have had the same experience, if he'd have liked someone else putting his arm around him and telling him the bartender is a good guy. I then ask the manager that I would like to pay again so that I have a new receipt to reflect that I was at the bar and paid twice. No apology out of the gate. It's better to hustle a random customer because, really, what ""privilege"" do you have?What could have been done differently? You tell me. It's a $6 non-alcoholic drink. Very expensive stuff. You've seen your customer make no effort to run away but is willing to work with the mismanaged bar to resolve this right away. You've established that this customer has been there previously, is recognizable and has tipped generously.Would he have put him arm around a tall blonde woman, or the bearded hipster, fuming at being treated like a thief? Is that how you would like to be treated? Is that how you want your fellow bar-mates to be treated?New Yorkers may be mistaking this for something else, but of course this place really means to be a cheap ""colonial"" place harkening back to the good times, and find itself bang in the heart of New York, effectively the birthplace of America. I would like to think the ""good times"" ended with the Boston tea party, but may be there are New Yorkers, even tourists searching for this pre Boston tea party America. Perhaps there are good folk on the Upper West Side who would like to commune with colonialism after their hot yoga class and keep this anachronism alive.A lot of places come and go- New York deserves better.

However, it took a solid 15 minutes for our server to approach our table and the restaurant was not very busy when we sat down. No big deal, it happens. Our drink/food order was quickly taken once he approached our table. My friend enjoyed his roo burger, but I ordered the Large Plate Duck and this was the biggest disappointment. I requested medium rare and the meat arrived more well done and was extremely dry, overcooked, chewy and was not palatable. It was also strange there was no sauce for the duck, which likely could not have saved how overcooked the meat was. I could barely cut it with a knife. My second issue is that when I sent the food back, as I could not eat it, our server looked at me strange and did not even offer to send out a complimentary dessert or even try to make up for the fact that the meal was ruined. He did not even apologize. I work in a luxury 5 star hotel in midtown in rooms division, and deal with issues likes this all the time with guests. I have no issues with a poor entree. It's how an establishment comes back and makes up for it and turns the situation around. Zero attempt here. Super unfortunate dining experience when you walk away being so let down. Not asking for anything, I just wanted to share my experience and feedback so the restaurant can better improve for the future. Sincerely, Patrick",1,0,0,Patrick W.,"Manhattan, NY",0,1,0

Even with me being difficult, they still accommodated. When I said were on a rush, food came out instantly, albeit the bread took some time to come. Great modern Aussie fare with an excellent raw bar. The Roo Loin is fantastic and the Coddled Egg with asparagus and prociutto was surprisingly hefty and delicious. New Australian cuisine is basically an excuse to use multiple European cuisines on traditional Australian ingredients, and that shines through here.

1.0,4/16/2016,"so, by posting a true review of this place 2 days ago, it is no longer viewable, which doesn't speak well for Yelp's claims of unbiasness. what's the point of a restaurant review site that ""picks & chooses""??? u, the reader, be the judge. 2 days ago, i posted a review, which apparently has been removed! so for those of u who r considering going - beware! i wrote, several observations, to start, they charge $14/ for a buffalo trace bourbon, when u can buy a bottle @ retail $29.74 - u do the math as to the mark-up, but then again u may enjoy overpaying. take a look at the wines, quality of & prices... i do not mind paying up for quality, but this place.....; the bar space is cramped; the tables spaces are maximized for the owners benefit, not the customers comfort, the food is mediocre at best.as i also stated, the place is inhabited by a very loud unsophisticated youngish crowd who seem to think they have a clue, about everything, but then again as per H.L. Mencken's famous quote ""No one ever went broke underestimating the intelligence of the American public."" if u have the patience to read previous reviews u will note a number of similar observations. interestingly, on a closer read, the comments touting this place seem more like shills, than actual reviews. every time i have a conversation about UWS restaurants, an overwhelming majority seem to agree the UWS is a restaurant wasteland, & burke & wills simply represent yet another sad example. but, as i stated, those who enjoy the mediocre & being overcharged for what u are receiving - by all means go - that's what the owner is counting on - your lack of any ability to distinguish between.we'll see how long this review stands for those who like to read a true assessment, then judge themselves if they agree or disagree!",0,0,0,Jay G.,"Manhattan, NY",0,7,0

4.0,4/3/2016,"had dinner here and it was pretty good, really nice atmosphere and enjoyable experience overall. Service was great at being there at the right times and not rushing you. The roo burger was on the salty side but that being the first time I had kangaroo meat maybe that's just how it tastes like, how would I know haha, still delicious. On the other hand I have had braised pork belly before so I can tell yah their braised pork belly is amazing. Also their happy hour oysters are HUMONGOUS. Oh, but warning about the happy hour, it's cash only!!! I've tried most of their cocktails and most of them are pretttttay sweet. Only one disappointing experience, where we didn't even make it past the door:during happy hour one time they gave us a tour of the second floor which was this speakeasy type bar. I was super excited to try it but when I came another time to try it out, even though they had room for our party upstairs we were turned away! D: Apparently upstairs has a super formal dress code so if you're reading this and are interested, don those nice clothes before hand! My friends and I weren't in exactly the shabbiest gear so they're pretty strict. I mean I personally didn't really notice a difference between what we wore and what I saw people wearing on the second floor during the tour, so they must have changed their policy or something between now and then.",0,0,0,Rosa T.,"New York, NY",54,12,0
4.0,3/27/2016,"First Australian restaurant for both my boyfriend and I, so we were quite excited. Interestingly, unlike another diner, I happened to like the decor of the restaurant. Little photo frames everywhere, all about something relating to Australia (at least from my seat, that's what it looked like lol). The high glass ceiling must look fabulous when the sun is coming in or even maybe during a great sunset. Our cocktails were delicious, and hit the spot after a day of work.As I didn't have the courage to try an entire burger of kangaroo, I got the mixed mushroom pasta and he got the roo burger. Both were tasty and I got to try a bit of the roo burger and I did like it, but don't know if I would have been able to handle the burger to be honest. At the end, we got a dessert, passion fruit creme brûlée, but the wrong passion fruit dessert (with berries and a meringue) came out, which was fine. We still ate it happily, but our really nice waiter (so sorry, I forgot the name...) told us he took it off our bill. I hope he doesn't get anything taken off his pay or anything!

5.0,3/6/2016,"LOVE everything about this restaurant and would give 6 stars if I could. Definitely want to go back, and have exactly the food and experience I had last night.The ambiance is wonderful, dimly lit, warm, cozy and classy. My first time at an Australian restaurant and the accents / couple Australian  employees, nice.  Everyone was so friendly. Evan the server was top top, above and beyond with service. He was attentive, knowledgable about the dishes and what to recommend. Great personality, a little witty. He recommended a perfect off the menu Mezcel cocktail when I said what I liked which was amazing, and when my friend was asking for a wine he brought over two to taste before ordering.The food was mouthwatering outstanding - everything we had and shared: I especially liked the pairing of two entrees and appetizers in one dish:Small plates:- Fantastic bread roll; also a dish with oil, butter and salt. So good.- kangaroo- I was concerned about the visual of a cute jumping roo my first time having this but did all right; it was wonderful, flavored with a perfect sauce. Hedgehog  mushrooms and brussel leaves complimented.  - grilled octopus and braised pork loin- what a unique and absolutely delectable pairing. Chorizo and white beans a fabulous compliment.  The short rib was melt in your mouth good, and the octopus was cooked and flavored just right.Large plates:- Duck breast and confit legs, cooked perfectly, outstanding. Amazingly flavored, delicious.- Filet, braised short rib. Another first but the marrow while not something I'd tried was outstanding with the filet and, the short rib was another tender melt in your mouth experience. To cap off the perfect meal, Evan had someone  give us a back hallway entrance to the upstairs speak easy for after dinner drinks.

I walked in, was greeted, someone took my coat for me and seated me at the dining room. Bread to start was great, nicely toasted. Appetizer: Braised Pork Belly - great seasoning, overall very yummy (4/5) Kangaroo Loin - personally, I thought the meat was a bit gamey, but my bf liked it. Entree:Australian Lamb Rack - This is so good, met is tender..... its just very comforting to eat.... I would definitely get this again if I were to come back.The 'Roo Burger - This was the popular dish to try, it was ok, a bit difficult to eat (due to size, hard to get a good bite)... it comes with ketchup for those who don't like it, you should probably ask to not have it added. Dessert:Affogato - This is soooo goood.... go with this option hands down. Coffee shot with ice cream. House Made Donuts -This was also good / ok - 3 small powdered Donuts with nutella dipping sauce on the side, but just listen to me and go with the Affogato!Overall had a great dinner, the service is great in the sense that staff is friendly, and accommodating but wish the food came out a bit quicker.

Upon entry you will be greeted by a long bar area and a small DJ booth. They have some of the best deals for Happy Hour so don't miss that.Main dining room is in the back in a conservatory type room with glass ceiling. You leave the crowds and noise levels of the bar in to this relaxed area with decorations focused on Australian Cricket personalities, teams, paraphernalia, etc. They created an atmosphere which does a good job of transforming you to a far away land.Had to try the Roo Loin and the Rack of Lamb. Both were very good. Besides those also tried the Pork Belly, Scallops, Duck Breast and Roasted Chicken with pleasant experiences.Servers and manager did a great job of welcoming us and making sure we enjoyed our meal.There is a secret door with stairs leading upstairs to the Manhattan Cricket Club on the way to the rear dining room. You can check with the host about having pre or post dinner drinks but we were told reservations are required for most times due to the popularity of this venue.Overall you can't go wrong with Burke & Wills either in the mood for Happy Hour by the front bar or something different but something very tasty in the rear dining room.

There is an upstairs speak easy that is also really nice with some awesome cocktails. Unfortunately it's almost impossible to get up there.

For the appetizer, I got the parsnip and white chocolate/truffle soup, which was delicious. The menu said ""parsnip chips,"" but nothing like that came out with the soup that I could tell. I asked the waiter and he didn't know what it was supposed to be. My boyfriend had the scallops and he enjoyed them. He also had the beer battered fish sandwich, which he described as ok. I had the kangaroo pie, which I learned isn't made at the restaurant but is brought in from somewhere else and heated up, which I thought was strange. It was good, but a little chef boyardee in flavor. The greens that came on the side were incredibly salty though to the point where I couldn't finish them.  For dessert I had the almond flour donuts. They're very dense and yummy and covered in powder sugar, but the ""nutella dipping sauce"" is literally a spoonful of nutella on the plate. I was expecting maybe some kind of ganache where it was more thinned out like an actual sauce. My boyfriend had the cheese plate and really enjoyed it, but it was supposed to come with granulated honey (according to the menu) and did not.  Overall, I might come back, but definitely not for lunch.",0,0,0,Victoria D.,"New York, NY",0,31,30

Always with a smile, never with an attitude, this is one of the few bars in NYC where I felt completely at home, as I did when I lived in Ireland almost 20 years ago.

In any case, it's high end food at it's best. The drinks are phenomenal, the food is top notch, and the deserts are great.Tim comes from a small town in Australia and has been in hospitality for nearly his entire life.

Favorites of the night were 1) cured hamachi 2) short rib. Both were exceptional. The Arctic char was also very delicious and came in the most wonderful broth.

5.0,9/29/2015,"I popped my 'roo cherry here (i.e. ate kangaroo for the first time), and because I'm such a food slut, I had to have it two ways--the Roo Burger...and the Kangaroo Loin (the sex jokes just write themselves). It actually tasted like a less flavorful form of beef, but whatevs, it's the experience that counts, right?Actually, 'roo aside, the food here is stellar. The Burrata appetizer with Burgandy snails, butternut squash and basil seeds is insanely delicious, and the accompaniments to the aforementioned Loin--sweet potato, bok choy and pomegranate reduction--were very well made. The Farrotto aas my favorite: a simple, flavorful concoction of mushrooms and herbs.Besides the pretty decor, I have to champion the amazing service. We definitely overstayed our welcome on a busy Friday night, and rather than get passive-aggressive, the staff simply asked us if we'd like to extend our evening at the bar upstairs. Sure, we replied sheepishly. That sheepishness turned to astonishment when we discovered that this ""bar"" was really a gorgeous, brick-walled, library-esque speakeasy--complete with cheeky bartender, delicious cocktails and upscale clientele.The moral of the story is: You do not need to spend $2,000 to fly to Aussieland to try kangaroo.

I asked the waitress if they could cut the burger in half to make it easier to share. She smiled, laughed, and said no they can't do that. I honestly thought it was a joke like ""haha such a simple request, of course we can do that!"" Nope. She comes back with an uncut burger. K. Laughing and smiling like it's a joke is not how you handle that. Perhaps an ""I'm sorry, but the chef cares a great deal about presentation, but you can cut it after it comes out."" Ridiculous.

4.0,9/19/2015,"Burke & Wills is a cool Australian restaurant in the UWS.  I actually mentioned it to my Australian boyfriend, who started laughing - Burke & Wills are two actual explorers in Australian history, kindof like America's Lewis and Clark.  Except instead of making nation-changing discoveries, they foolishly believed there was water in the middle of Australia and died on their expedition... so a little more of a cautionary (but somehow funny) tale.Anyway, I visited here often in the lead-up to my first Australian expedition.  The manager was always around, and the bartenders are all friendly.  The food is really good - a favorite on the bar snacks menu that I always get is foie gras butter.  Yum.You can also get a 'roo burger (yes, kangaroo), complete with beet (or beetroot, as they say in Oz) and an egg.  And at brunch, an Australian iced coffee, which is expresso, milk, and ice cream.  Lol.They have a great happy hour with $1 oysters and 2-for-1 drinks (at the bar, cash only) every day, including Saturday and Sunday (5-7pm)!  Lastly, upstairs is a semi-secret bar called the Manhattan Cricket Club (that's got its own Yelp page).All around a cool place to come for any meal, any reason.",2,3,2,Dione D.,"Atlanta, GA",104,606,455

4.0,9/6/2015,"Came here during a 3 day weekend on Sunday for brunch. Was very quiet, only two other groups in the back dining room. Great first impression, place is classy, clean and well decorated. We ordered and while waiting were offered a choice of pastry. We chose the croissants, once you get past the fact that they're not real croissants overall they tasted good. Drinks included a Bloody Mary and 'the greyhound' and were good though both seemed a little watered down. The greyhound also was made with warm juice which means waiting for the ice to melt for it to be cold and more water in your drink. Coffee was a little on the watered down side too. Food was 'the swagman' and the 'lox benny'. The swagman was good but definitely needs a side of bread. As for the lox Benny, on the salted side but to be expected with lox. The hollandaise was very good. To finish things off we ordered the warm chocolate cake. Very good, wait time was only a few minutes but most likely because of how quiet the place was. Service was excellent and waitstaff very attentive. Recap, work on your drinks and coffee being less watery. Serve bread with the swagman.

This was a fabulous salad and I loved the fritters! Really great flavors going on; I wish there was so much more.Kangaroo Loin ($19) with sweet potato purée, bok choy, and pomegranate reduction. My first time having kangaroo and it was nice. I liked the temperature of the meat as it was rare/medium rare and tender. All the accompaniments were delicious.Lamb Crépinette ($15) with cauliflower purée, roasted rainbow cauliflower, capers, and lamb jus.

Happy hour was 2 drinks for the price of one  per person. Great deal of you like drinking their array of cocktails. The bartender was really busy but he was crushing drinks and getting them out at a good amount of time. Know what you want! Do be those guys who are indecisive on picking a drink when the bar is packed and the bartender won't have time to chit-chat. I got the Sydney Sour, if you like bourbon get this! We got a table for four in the back room. Really nice decor and music. Everything just seemed to flow right. It was our first time here and I wanted to try a new place.  Glad I picked it! The food was on point. I ordered an app with octopus and pork belly. The pork belly was slightly over cooked but it was fine. The octopus was perfect!! Great flavors all around. I ordered the roo burger and I was questioning it bc I never had kangaroo but gotta try new things! And it was delicious, orders it med. perfectly cooked and perfectly oozing with flavor not dry at all. The steak fries were a nice addition. Dessert was amazing!

The seafood - octopus and prawns - were fresh and prepared beautifully. The duck was hearty and so moist and tender. The desserts were especially impressive. Definitely made fresh. Get something with chocolate!My only issue is that the portions are very small. The prices would not be bad if you were getting a filling meal. What they serve is more of a tasting.

Our waiter was attentive and funny.Reason for four stars is I was sitting at the bar when it opened up, and when I requested to order, the bar tender asked me to leave the bar as there was a party he was speaking to that he wanted to sit there.. there was no other bar seating, and so I had to wait for my table reservations before I could order something.

4.0,8/5/2015,"GUH. I was really torn between giving this place 3 or 4 stars. The two girls I went with were not fans and would not come back here. I wouldn't rush to come back here, but I can't say my experience was poor. I have been wanting to try this place for so long, I've never had Australian cuisine before. I anticipated so much from this place that I think I was a bit disappointed, but overall had a good experience. Sorry about the quality of my pictures. I couldn't turn on flash or anything...not exactly the kind of place where people take kindly to someone snapping pics of food with bright flash!We came during restaurant week, and I must say, the menu was pretty impressive. We did not make a reservation, so we had to wait upstairs in the lounge which wasn't a problem. Side note: This place is very very close to the train, so, easy to find. After waiting an hour, we were finally seated. The dining room is beautiful - great mood lighting, dark colors, interesting decor, high ceiling with glass roof, a bit on the ""stuffy and sophisticated"" side. For a drink, I ordered their Bushfire margarita. It was definitely difficult to get down at first...very funky aftertaste, but got better. For a small plate, I ordered the kangaroo loin. At first I was nervous because I find kangaroos to be extremely cute, but then I remember they punch and kick people and I felt OK with eating it. The kangaroo was absolutely PERFECT, I'd dare say it was better than a steak for sure. Extremely juicy and flavorful! The corn and broccoli rabe complimented the small dish perfectly. Very, very good. For dinner I got the Australian lamb duo. I know that overcooking lamb is a sin, so I got medium-rare. It came out very red (obviously) but tasted perfect. I hated whatever else came on my plate, some kind of disgusting mushroom that literally tasted like dirt. My best friend got the duck breast which neither of us were fans of, and we normally love duck. Despite being very full, we ordered dessert. All three of us ordered the Affogato with a shot of Frangelico and LOVED it. It was amazing and we have been raving to people since we had it. It's Kahlua gelato with a brownie and side of espresso (and we had the side of Fran) then you pour both in, mix it up, and eat. DELISH. Server was very helpful, bold, patient, and fun. My two friends did not like their meal (minus dessert, loved that) I greatly enjoyed my meal, but would not run back here anytime soon. I really want to give this 3.5 stars.

4.0,8/4/2015,"A reservation was easily made at Burke & Wills for a party of 6.  We were seated promptly in the beautiful dining room in the back - high ceilings and great mood lighting.  This place would be an excellent choice for a date.  The noise level isn't too high, but not too quiet at the same time.Service - our waiter definitely gave off a standoffish vibe and didn't seem all that friendly.  That's the only downside.  However, I did receive a free plate of bok choy for some reason, in addition to my french fries (though I just wanted a substitution) - thanks!We started off with some littleneck clams which were fairly fresh and delicious.For my entree, I had to have the 'roo burger, of course.  They were out of the kangaroo loin dish due to a large party the night before - bad planning on their part, especially for the people who come here looking to try kangaroo meat and not in a burger.  The burger was juicy and cooked medium rare, just like I like it.  The ""chips"" or ""fries"" were thick cut and crispy on the outside, soft on the inside - the best!  The bok choy was good as well, though an interesting side for an Australian restaurant to have (do they eat bok choy, a Chinese vegetable, often?)  Their menu doesn't seem to have this choice anymore anyways.Overall a good spot for a dinner, though not on the cheaper side (especially for a burger).  Expect to pay $30-$50 per person here.  Probably my second favorite Australian place after The Thirsty Koala in Astoria.",3,1,1,Allene T.,"Manhattan, NY",2170,1311,3573
3.0,7/29/2015,"Came here recently during restaurant week on a Friday night, was so looking forward to trying the foods since we have yet to try Australian cuisine n because of its great selection on the menu unlike other restaurant week menus at other places. here's my take based on ambiance, food, drinks, & service:Ambiance:Interesting decor, very nice use of small space. We were seated at a corner booth for 2 ppl. Roomy and comfy! 5 stars! The dining room has window/glass ceiling, very nice. Drinks:we opted for wine pairing... not a smart move... The wine were only ok... Nothing spectacular.  I found the dessert wine quite interesting, but my man kept on saying that it smelled like paint thinner lol. I ended up drinking his share as well. 3+starsFood:I must say I was very disappointed.... We ordered steak tartare and grilled octopus for apps.... Octopus extremely salty, altho pork belly that came w octopus was fatty n good but not good enough to accompany the octopus, the saltiness of the octopus totally ruined it... Steak tartare was tasty with the very first batch of toasts (3 thick pieces) however the meat was too stringy/chewy and almost impossible to avoid it from being stuck in teeth. We have had steak tartare elsewhere and this was by far the chewiest. Btw we had to request more toasts for the tartare.  We were given a second batch of toasts and were given different kinds, mini toasts like the kind for bruschetta, perfect for tartare, but this batch was quite stale and we could barely use any...When it comes to main dish, my man had the NY strip n I had prawns, the steak was not hot at all n very chewy... Asked for medium rare n came out almost medium well.... My prawns were slightly overcooked n didn't seem fresh... Food only 2 stars, it's unfortunate!Dessert:This portion of our meals was the best. Affogato and beignets were the highlights of our nights! I give this 5 stars!Service:meals came out within reasonable time, our server was very friendly.  The only issue was our drinks. We had wine pairing and we pretty much waited for at least 5 minutes after apps n main courses were placed on table each time before getting our wines. He was very apologetic and ultimately was quick when giving out the dessert wine. We didn't really mind as we could see he was busy...So 4 stars here for serviceI would have given 5 stars if it's not because of my pickiness when it comes to food.

My companion had the pork belly and you can't go wrong with either. For our mains,  we opted for the roo burger and the lamb loin, which is a +$10 supplement. Both were  great! Medium rare preparation is recommended because of lean the meats are. Dessert was great well. The peach tart and the chocolate cake with gelato are decadent. You can't go wrong with this menu.

The scallops were tender and perfectly seasoned but the escargot seems a bit over salted as well. For entree we had Australian lamb duo & rotisserie chicken, they were both delightful and cooked to perfection but its not something id go out of my way for. For dessert I ordered the peach tart while my friend ordered the chocolate cake with berries and gelato. The peach tart had to much honey for my liking but the chocolate cake was delightful, not too sweet and had a lava cake-ish texture and feel.

2.0,7/21/2015,"This rating is for the food. Service was wonderful throughout except they charged us extra $76 by mistake at the end of the night.. haha so you can be the judge. We came as a group of eight for a friend's birthday and ordered the restaurant week menu (it's either none or the whole party has to do the restaurant week menu). A 3 course meal is $38 + extra $10 more on few other entrees. I went with the Grilled Octopus, the NY Strip Steak ($10), and Affogato for dessert.Quality of the Octopus was a bit dried and the tentacle was charred. It was ok but I definitely had better. The NY Strip was the worst I've ever had unfortunately... The waiter suggested med rare and the steak came out perfectly as ordered, but the major problem was that the meat was VERY tough! I couldn't chew nor cut through it without a fight. Three other friends also ordered the steak and complained the same. I thought it was silly to pay extra for a dish like this. The croquettes were also a bit too salty, the one and only bok choy has SAND in it!! After 3 bites I just gave up on the dish. Usually I'd send the dish back or at least let the waiter know, but since it was my friend's bday, I didn't want to create any unpleasant moments for him. Dessert Affogato was good, though the gelato was half melted upon arrival. Oysters were ok, not too fresh but edible. If you have an option to sit inside or in the back room during a summer night, choose the inside. We sat against the left wall and our table was covered with these tiny bugs with white wings. A few went into our food and many crawed all over our table. If you look at the table at the end of the night, there were a dozen of dead bugs we killed during dinner. Our waiter apologized a few times for the bugs, but nothing he can do or move us, so thats for that. Bottom line is that drinks were good, services was good, but food quality and cleanliness were not great at all! My husband and I spent $180 at the end of the night and our only hope was that our friend had an okay bday dinner.",3,0,0,Shu V.,"Brooklyn, NY",2,12,2

My date and I split the beef tartar for an app. This is one of my favorite apps to order but normally don't do so often because at most restaurants you don't get a very big portion and it can be pricy. I was impressed to see the portion size when I ordered it last night. It was visually appealing as well as delicious.  My date went for the roo burger while I got the kangaroo loin from the small plate menu.

4.0,6/28/2015,"Have to start by informing my fellow Yelpers this place has an Old Fashioned served from a tap. And it's pretty darn good. Served over a giant cube of ice and a just peeled right in front of you slice of orange rind, this drink surprised me for how simple it's construction but also that it it came from a beer tap and tasted good. They mix small batches, fill up refillable kegs and voilà! easily dispensed goodness. It's a Rye based drink as well, not a Bourbon. Ok. Got that out of the way.The atmosphere is cozy with a slender front space for the bar which opens up to a dining area in the back that is a tad more spacious and much more well lit. The tenders and servers are friendly and the food is great if a bit on the meager side for portions. Happy hour specials are two drinks for one and 1$ oysters.(cash only) the oysters were Blue Point (long island) which is a great basic oyster and these were as fresh as could be just wish they had some horseradish and hot sauce instead of just vinegar and two tiny lemon wedges for 12 oysters.There is a large list of apps that are all 5$ and it includes some personal favs like the Foie Gras butter served with pickled peaches and the crispy Pork Belly with a white bean purée. Also, the mixed nuts were good and the fries were ok, but they more resembled wedges or blocks of potato than fries though the dipping sauce they came with was phenomenal! The salmon rilette  was not very good. The Foie butter was heavenly and caused my tongue to fly around the room singing about angels but served on a paper thin tiny sliver of bread that was crispy for about five seconds and the two small pieces of pork belly were so good I did a backflip and the running man up and down the bar but immediately after I fell into a deep depression for a month because I realized there was no more of this soul rending balance of melty fat, crispy flesh and I ran out of adjectives bean purée.  Overall, a great experience and a definite followup trip is in the works but please! please! up your portion sizes.

Happy hour lasts until 8 PM giving you more than enough time to scoot out of work and get here and it's 2 for 1 cocktails (drinks go for around $13.00). Also, the cocktails are not mediocre. They're not making you crap just because they're giving you a deal, which is the best part. The bartenders are making you amazing cocktails that would go for $15.00+ anywhere else per drink.It doesn't end there. Happy hour also consists of $1.00 oysters but all of the bar snacks I've ordered have been delish.Quick but important notes that I wish someone had told me..

The lightly seasoned breast, ordered medium rare, came out very tender and juicy (hopefully visible despite my subpar pic taking skills) along with a perfectly crisped layer of skin.

3.0,5/3/2015,"Having never tried Australian cuisine, my husband and I decided to try this place out. We made reservations and were seated right away. The dining area is tiny but comfortable. Nice atmosphere.The food was OK. I ordered the Salmon which was soggy and lacked flavor. My husband got the 'roo burger, which was OK but very dry. It was served with fries, which were huge and almost undercooked. It was just too much potato. The aioli sauce was really good and spicy.For desert we got the Bomboli I think it is called and that was super delicious.Prices are decent but the food is nothing special.

2.0,4/30/2015,I had been once before to have a cocktail upstairs and decided to try dinner at the bar.   The food was tasty but the portions were extremely small and misleading.  I wanted to quickly eat and go and the bartender charged my credit card 7 times when he then told me my card was declined and if he could try another card.  I did not want him to do the same on my other card so I called Amex and she told me the card is fine and that the issue is their system.  The manager came over and neglected to apologize for the mistake even after I showed him my account with the charges.  He made it as if the issue was my card which I had already determined was fine.  Neither employee recognized that I was the client and made me feel very uncomfortable.  I will not be returning to Burke & Willis.,0,0,0,Dan D.,"Manhattan, NY",0,17,0

5.0,4/19/2015,"Let me start by saying that I'm usually not one to spend a lot of money on food. So the three dollar signs by this Australian restaurant would normally have been enough to make me think twice, but a friend was celebrating a new job, so what the heck. That said, when I say that this experience was amazing enough that I want to go back, you know it's serious.The entrance area of the restaurant didn't look super exciting--it seemed like a generic bar, dark and narrow and not very pretty--but we were seated in the back, which had a surprisingly elegant appearance, including a glass roof with views of the outside.I knew coming in that I had to try some sort of kangaroo meat, so there were two choices on the menu: the small-plate kangaroo loin, or the kangaroo burger. I felt like the loin would be more interesting, so that's what I tried to order, but the server warned me that their small plates aren't really enough for a full meal. So since it was a splurge day (and my friend was paying for appetizers!), I added the escargot to start and a side of farrotto (which I had never heard of before, but it was basically risotto made from farro rather than rice).The escargot was just fantastic, accompanied by squash puree and perfectly seasoned. The farrotto was also delicious, and the portion size was much more generous than I'd expected. I probably would have had enough to eat with just the escargot and the farrotto, which is actually what I'll try to do next time (except I don't actually see the escargot on the menu right now! Please tell me it wasn't a one-time daily special). The kangaroo loin was definitely the least exciting part of the meal, but that's not really surprising when I basically just ordered it for the novelty. Overall, I was extremely happy with the food, enough to brave the prices again in the future. If the night had ended with dinner, I would have gone home satisfied.But wait! It turned out that our excellent experience had just begin. After finishing our food, we sat talking at the table for what was probably way too long on a crowded evening, and the servers were really polite about it and didn't make us feel like we had to hurry out. After maybe an hour from the time we'd paid, though, our server did come up to us and ask nicely whether we'd like to go upstairs.Upstairs? What's up there? Oh, it's just a speakeasy, no big deal. Um, hell yes, we'd like to go upstairs. So we did. And the décor was AMAZING. I just wanted to stop and stare at everything. Gilded wallpaper, leather seats, wooden bookshelves.... I'm pretty sure our jaws dropped when we first stepped in.We were escorted to a seat at a bar, where my friend ordered a drink. I asked what the non-alcoholic options were, and made a sad face when the bartender said that the choice was water. But then, a few minutes later, I found that he'd managed to prepare a drink for me after all! It was a non-alcoholic version of my friend's, and while it was maybe a bit more citrusy than I normally like, I was just thrilled to have something other than water. (Okay, maybe I'm pretty easy to please sometimes.) The bartender was also really nice about letting us take photos of the bar area, which we initially tried and failed to do stealthily. And when I asked whether we could have separate checks, he looked at me strangely and said that I didn't owe any money--my drink was on the house! What a perfect experience.If I wanted to nitpick, I could say that the upstairs bar area was sometimes too noisy, and we would have preferred to sit in the comfy chairs if there had been space available, but the experience as a whole was so good that I was not in a complaining mood at all. When you eat some absolutely delicious food, and chat at leisure after your meal in a crowded restaurant, and are eventually escorted to an unexpected speakeasy where you have a free drink.... Yeah, there will be no complaining here. I can't wait to go back. I honestly can't remember a better overall dining experience in the city.",0,0,0,Zoe M.,"New York, NY",0,7,0

4.0,4/12/2015,"Argghhh I'm so bummed!! I really wanted to try Kangaroo, but it isn't offered on their brunch menu. It's offered in two places on their other menus, so I really had trouble understanding why it wasn't a brunch option. I mean, get real -- how many people who go to an Australian restaurant would want to try 'roo?? Ninety per cent? I sure would have been one of them.Anyway, despite the missing Loin of Kangaroo I was hoping to try, we had a terrific lunchtime meal here on Saturday. We sat in the Atrium room behind the bar and it was a gorgeous space.Our server was terrific, pleasant, efficient, and quick with the water glasses.The music they played was stellar - a great mix of Steely Dan, the Stones, the Clash, Talking Heads, and yes.... Men At Work.Our lunch choices were a ""Burger with the lot"", a French Toast, and for me a ""salad with the lot"" a very nice $17 dish of scrumptious rotisserie chicken, kale, carrots, feta cheese, olives, beets, and hard boiled egg wedges.  The beets were a star of the plate- just bursting with flavor.There are probably a bazillion food choices in Manhattan, and this one ended up being a very solid choice for us.  Even if I didn't get a chance to see what kangaroo tastes like............Take it away boys....""Do you come from a land down under?Where women glow and men plunder?

4.0,3/16/2015,"A few of my girlfriends and I were looking for a place on the Upper West Side to have brunch. As we were browsing the Internet, we noticed that most of the UWS places don't take reservations during brunch, which is really inconvenient when you are a larger group and also have a baby with you. I think at this stage in our lives, we are past waiting an hour to be sat at a trendy place. In our searches on Google, we came across Burke & Wills, which is actually the same owner of the previous Sunburnt Calf, and they were willing to take reservations!!! Burke and Wills is now the grown up version of the Sunburnt Calf with an updated classy atmosphere, fancier menu, and no all you can drink brunch special, keeping the rowdy rif-raf patrons away. The brunch drink menu was more interesting and exciting than a lot of the typical brunch spots, because it featured a Build Your Own Bloody Mary bar. The bar didn't just have different garnishes, but it also had different mixes, liquors, and rims to choose from.The bartender manning the Bloody Mary station was extremely helpful and willing to let us all try each rim, and also each mix before deciding which one we wanted for our drink. I chose the Kaffir-lime infused rim and chipotle mix with vodka liquor. For the garnishes, they had so many choices! We were given a stick and we were allowed to take as many garnishes that fit onto the stick! I chose pork belly, shrimp, and a spicy red pepper. They had plenty of olives, celery, and other garnishes to choose from as well. The pork belly was definitely one of the highlights of my drink, along with the chipotle mix, which was just the right level of spicy. I would definitely return for this station again, since it was a lot of fun to compare with each other what we each chose for our garnish.For my meal, I got the Swagman's Breakfast, which was definitely the highlight of the table! It was similar to a full English Breakfast in style, but so much more gourmet! The hanger steak was cooked to perfection with a red center, which is the way I love my steak. The pork belly was a nice addition to the dish, even though I had already enjoyed it on my bloody mary. The roasted mushrooms were plentiful and cooked with the perfect texture and flavor. Oddly, the mushrooms were one of my favorite parts of this dish because they really added so much extra flavor to the dish. The potatoes were nice and thick cut. The side salad was marinated very lightly and added the needed freshness to this dish since it was so hearty and heavy otherwise. The eggs I ordered sunny side up, and they were cooked perfectly.If I need a brunch in the UWS, this is definitely at the top of my list! It was convenient, low key, and delicious!",1,0,2,Carlen M.,"Manhattan, NY",370,97,473

Service:Our waiter was good, he was attentive and tried to fix all of the issues the best he could.  A member of my party received a flat glass of Brut and he quickly replaced with a fresh one without a hesitation.  The waiter is the only reason this review will go as high as a 2/5 stars.  Food: Food was decent, I got the ""meat"" entree which has 3 types of meat.  I was still hungry when I was done eating and it was about $35.  The spare rib seemed a little dry and the steak was just lacking any good flavor.Overall, I will not be returning (again).  The food and overall experience is just not worth it.",1,0,0,Alex F.,"Manhattan, NY",2,12,7

We caught the beginning of their happy hour at the bar (5-7pm Sat/Su, 4-7 weeknights (I think)) and ordered two dozen $1 oysters (solid) and cocktails (ok) while waiting for the dining area to open.Servers from the bar to the main dining room were super attentive and very nice. It wasn't so full when we dined, so volume was at a nice level too. However... the cocktails were okay / standard (I had the bushfire margarita and tasted my friends' drinks; my favorite was the old fashioned). For the main meal, I split the rack of lamb and 'roo burger with a friend. The lamb was a tender cut and very nicely cooked -- but either flavorless or oddly flavored somehow. The 'roo burger was an interesting concept (first time having this meat), but as a burger, it was just okay-good.Maybe it's just what we ordered, but while I'm glad I tried out the place, I probably won't revisit for a full dinner.

For brunch, the menu is a bit limited but they have great and interesting options. Pancakes with foie gras butter? Yes and yes! Their bloody mary is to die for, by the way. For dinner, I have never been disappointed. Only the duck dish is really overpriced for what it is, I don't really understand. But everything else is good and definitely worth it. Try the kangaroo burger! And the cocktails, again, are really good and you can tell that they are made by someone who knows his job.Another remarkable thing is the service. All the waiters are INCREDIBLY friendly, a true Australian experience! The manager, Tim, is a sweetheart too. One of the first times I went after the place got renamed Burke & Wills I was on a date. They clearly noticed and gave us a round of cocktails on the house, which was such a nice thing to do. If you feel like fancying it up a little bit, ask to the staff that they take you upstairs. There is a speakeasy there. The atmosphere is incredibly cozy and intimate, think dim lights, big leather couches. and expensive cocktails. Definitely the best way to end a great dinner downstairs!",1,0,0,Clement D.,"New York, NY",0,8,0

Burke & Wills HH is a great one. 2-for-1 drinks, from 4-8pm, and $1 oysters. The rest of the HH menu is enticing as well, with $3-7 bites. They are, as you might expect for HH, just bites though, and if you get too happy on the food/drinks, the bill may come as a dour surprise.The bar is also a great place to wait out your MCC table... ;)",5,0,3,Esther L.,"Philadelphia, PA",482,264,138

A butternut squash soup, baby croutons and chestnut vinaigrette, poured before you.For the main dish I chose the thick sliced spiced duck breast rested on a bed of farotto, accompanied with roasted turnips, and a line of honey turnip glaze to drag each forkful over.

5.0,11/20/2014,"Love, love, love! Maybe it's because of the delicious cocktails that have intricate ingredients to masque away any strong taste of hard liquor, or maybe it's the interesting flavors of the bar snacks like the Kangaroo Loin or the Grilled Octopus, or even as simple as the $1 oyster happy hour available until 8pm (to go with your 2 for 1 drinks). It's always fresh and that leaves plenty of time to come after work, unlike other places where you have to do a mad rush to get a seat to make it to HH by 6pm or 7pm. I can relax here. The staff is really great and the bartenders are friendly and enjoyable to engage with. It's a small space near the bar and when it gets crowded, there's nothing really to work with, but I dig it and now that I recently moved nearby, I will come here quite often. But even when I didn't live near here, I would make the trip. They have a speakeasy upstairs but it's REALLY expensive and I'm not sure why...

The parsnip soup was absolutely salivating!  The waiter came to our table with a shallow bowl that had some herbs, parsnips, and truffles, and poured the soup into the bowl in front of me.  It was really creamy and silky, and had a bit of sweetness to it.  It ended the meal on a perfect note.  My friends were also happy with the dishes that they ordered.  In particular, they found the kangaroo burger less dry than other places that they've had it before.  Also, the spiced duck breast is definitely worth trying, and the lamb sliders as well, if they ever come back on the menu.  I learned from the waiter that they only served the lamb sliders at the bar the second time I came back.  Those were absolutely to die for.Service: Waiters were really friendly and professional.  They refilled our water constantly, and also gave my friends taste tests of different wines to let them see what they really wanted.  Also, they weren't pushy to make us order when we were still waiting on our friend.  Thumbs up!Ambiance: Trendy, and a nice place to bring a date, or a couple of friends for a fancy meal.",0,0,0,Nathaniel L.,"Flushing, Queens, NY",74,80,178

I'll start from the beginning.. we arrived a little early for our reservation and they were nice enough to seat us right away. The decor is awesome throughout the entire restaurant, and when you get to the dining room in the back, you sit beneath a glass ceiling. That made the entire brunch more cheery and bright. Next, the service was great! We had 3 different waiters come up to check on us periodically throughout the brunch and they made sure that the brunch cocktails were flowing! Our glasses were never empty. The food was outstanding! As someone with a few food allergies, I always get nervous about eating out, but they were receptive to me telling them about my food allergies and were able to make suggestions to me for the best items on the menu.

2.0,8/24/2014,"This place is completely overrated and am seriously confused by some of these 4-5 star reviews.  Just finished up a Sunday brunch here after being really excited to find an ""Australian"" restaurant in the city after so many great ones (Bondi Road & 8 Mile Creek) have closed down for various reasons over the last few years. The first warning sign was that when we entered the restaurant at close to 1pm there was one other table occupied, yellow alert right away.  At least this led to us being seated in one of the corner tables (which was a bit awkward, but still more comfortable looking that the rest of the seating options available).The Drinks: I ordered a ""Bitter and Twisted"" cocktail which was very nice (and the highlight of the entire experience), but then came warning sign number two in the form of the pre-made, poured from a water pitcher mimosa that my wife ordered (and she has never met a mimosa she didn't like).  This is something you just don't do in this city, EVER. The Food: ""B.E.L.T"" was overly fatty and could not be saved by the fried egg or what appeared to be a decent chipotle sauce (not listed in the menu description but this is a pretty close guess).  A massive disappointment if you have ever had properly cooked pork belly. The ""Roo Burger"", which many people seemed to have raved about here, was decent, but certainly not worthy of the sort of praise at the level given by other reviewers.  If you have had good kangaroo burgers or steaks before you will undoubtedly be let down here so lower your expectations accordingly.  The triple fried chips were OK as well, but again, basic fare prepared basically is no great achievement. The Service:  Attentive and friendly but not enough to warrant a repeat trip or save this place from the inevitable fate of the many, and much, MUCH better Australian establishments that have come before it. Conclusion: Proceed at your own risk, you can do better with minimal effort, and certainly don't waste your Restaurant Week experiences on this place......Rookie mistake.",1,0,0,Seth G.,"Denver, CO",0,3,0

The restaurant is small but looks great. The bar area takes up the front half of B&W so the restaurant seating area only fits less than 30. The service was very good and both people that served us were very cheerful. The food itself did not disappoint. The octopus app was small but the octo was tender and cooked perfectly with a subtle smokiness. The 'roo burger was a unique taste to say the least. Topped with tomato jam and sautéed onions, and mixed with 20% pork, it had a gamey quality that was very pleasant. It reminded me of lamb, not sure if others would agree .The other thing I picked up on is an assertive caraway/fennel seed taste that I didn't feel worked with the overall effect of the burger. Still enjoyable. For dessert I had the bombolinis stuffed with dulce de leche...very good. The wine pairings were decent, I enjoyed the white and the shiraz, not a fan of dessert wines.

They had a nice bar area that was busy and offered some great happy hour specials.  The staff were very friendly and our server was really sweet and helpful with explaining some menu items.

It truly had me excited for my entree of the spiced duck. I went back and forth about ordering the duck or kangaroo burger.  Since I love duck,  I ordered the duck that was an extra $9. This was my first negative duck meal.  First, I couldn't believe there were 4 pieces of meat on my plate with some grilled peaches.  I wondered where was the rest of my food? Okay,  after getting over the initial shock of my plate,  the duck was bland,  a little fatty and disappointing. I considered requesting something else after the 2nd piece I ate but just made the best of it since it would appear that I ate half of my meal.  I was able to spruce up the meat with the little bit of sauce on my plate and I mean, very little sauce.   My friend ordered the salmon and she seemed quite happy.  For dessert,  I ordered the brownie and my friend ordered the bombolini, their homemade donuts. I'm a chocolate fiend so how in the world do you mess up dessert. Well unfortunately,  my dessert consisted of two small thin pieces of hard brownie sticks with some ice cream. My friend on the other hand, devoured her  bombolini which were to die for.  I was so upset I didn't order that especially since my friend only let me taste two small bites but those small bites were the best part of my experience.

Chilled soup was a first for me but the addition of the bits of crab was a perfect touch for a seafood lover.For the main course, I have the slow cooked salmon which good but couldve been cooked a bit more for my taste because personally I dont care for meat or fish that is not well done. My friend had the spiced duck but she complained that it was very bland and undercooked as well. I did get a chance to taste the duck and although I agree that it was undercooked I thought it was pretty tasty.But the absolute best part without a doubt was MY dessert!

A few bar snacks too that are great (highly recommend the lamb ribs, merguez slider is yummy too). The one thing about drinks though is that both drinks must be consumed by one person - meaning if you go with a friend, you can't split the deal. Not a big issue though (just meant I got to get a little more schwasty on a Sunday night :x) and the bartender (who was great) told me this immediately, which I really appreciated. He also makes delicious drinks - I tried the Sydney sour which wasn't too sweet and the old fashioned which was so, so good.

5.0,7/4/2014,"Australian food? Needed to find a place on the UWS and this place intrigued me with the good reviews, plus I've never been to an Australian restaurant. Well this ain't no Outback thats for sure. When you walk in you immediately step into a long skinny bar area. They had 2 for 1 drinks until 8:00PM and $1 bluepoint oysters! Can't beat a deal like that. Bartender was really cool and made some fantastic drinks. Then into the main dinning room with a glass roof so you can see the stars, that was really cool as well. Our appetizers included lamb sliders, calamari and beef tartar all were excellent. We even tried the kale salad which was surprisingly good. The duck here is the best duck I have ever had, I will come back here just for the duck. My wife doesn't like duck but tried mine and said she really like it. The fish was good as well as the lamb chops. Unfortunately no one got the kangaroo burger, but they told us it was 20% pork to make it taste less gamey.

3.0,6/17/2014,"I had friends visiting town and thought going to The Sunburnt Calf on a Saturday morning before going to Central Park would be fun. They wanted to go to a DRUNK brunch. I was surprised to find The Sunburnt Calf no longer existed and instead it is called Burke & Wills. I looked at their menu online and it seemed to be the same as before (at least, I remembered the Burger with the Lot.) I noticed their unlimited drinks had changed to 4 but I figured that was more for legal reasons than actually cutting you off. I made reservations for 11:30am because in the past I when I have gone to both The Sunburnt Calf and Cow they were PACKED. Well, we showed up and we were literally the first people in the whole restaurant. 11:30am is early, but not THAT early. 2 girls came in a little after us. By the time we left around 2pm it was still not full, but more so. Definitely a different vibe than Sunburnt Calf used to be. I woudn't say it's a bad vibe, I was just looking for something a little rowdier and more inebriated. Prices are higher than they used to be. I'm pretty sure an entree and unlimited drinks used to be between $20-25. I'd be more likely to come back here with my parents than my friends.

The restaurant space is trendy but not annoyingly so, with an enormous skylight opening over the main dining area. Even on a cloudy morning, there's nothing better than eating breakfast in such amazing natural light.

4.0,5/17/2014,"First and foremost, the service here was amazing. Our server, Cassie, was a super sweet, attentive, adorable Aussie... Seriously loved her accent hah.We ordered the ceviche trio, the beef tartare, and the prawns. The ceviche came in three little sampler spoons, so it's definitely just a small sampler- barely enough to share. The bass ceviche was a little bland, but the fluke and clam ones were good- the clam one was the best; it had a nice acidic bite to it. The beef tartare was pretty good- it had capers in it and it came with a nice salty white anchovy on top. The presentation was really nice and the bread it came with was slightly charred which added a nice flavor to the dish. The star here hands down was the prawn dish. Absolutely delicious- topped with a fresh chimichurri sauce, the shrimp were full of flavor and beautifully presented. I wish there were a full dish with these prawns. The garlicky sauce was perfect to dip the bread in. Must order!To drink, we got the Sydney Sour and the Dark and Stormy. The Sydney Sour was super refreshing and tasty! Not too sweet, citrusy, and clean. The dark and stormy is a rum drink that has a bit of a kick to it- I think it has some Tabasco in it! It was delicious though.Really happy with the restaurant...

1.0,5/3/2014,"I had brunch at this restaurant with an UrbanDaddy perk that included one entree and unlimited drinks.  The dining room was small but nicely decorated with lots of natural light.  We were very disappointed with the slow service since there was only one waitress for a very busy brunch.  We ordered The Lot burger which is sold on the menu for $15 and were surprised when the waitress didn't ask how we wanted the burger cooked but then understood why when the burger arrived and it was a thin, well done frozen burger patty.  In a city like New York where you can find an amazing burger on almost every block I was shocked that this restaurant had the nerve to charge $15 for a frozen burger.  If I wanted slow service and frozen food I would have gone to McDonalds.  We left without even getting a second drink because it was taking so long to order another one and no one cleared our dirty plates so we just sat there staring at our uneaten frozen patty.  I already emailed UrbanDaddy to get my money back on the voucher....",2,0,1,Leah S.,"New York, NY",0,3,1

Rest assured, we asked and the server confirmed that the ownership is still the same, they just classed up the joint a little bit =)Menu is more or less the same food-wise, although they did nix my fave eggs benedict. I'll forgive them though since there are other tasty brunch options.One major change is that they now take reservations for groups less than six people. It's not as crowded as it was before it closed for renovations, but still a good idea to call ahead just in case. Another change since it reopened is that there is no longer ""unlimited""  beverages with brunch. However, the current deal is $15 for 4 drinks (which is about how much I would drink anyway), and also I found the mimosas to be tastier than they were when the deal was unlimited.One thing to keep in mind is that it is still cash only for brunch.All in all, we're still big fans of this place and it is a solid go-to brunch option when we have guests!

The crowd was mostly other groups of friends having a good time. The menu is hearty, mostly roasted and slow cooked dishes. We had:- Bass Crudo - a standout on the menu, with coconut and thai flavors we thoroughly enjoyed. A good option if you want a lighter starter.- Quail  - this dish was salted, savory, and delicious. While we both enjoyed the quail itself, my friend and I also really liked the quinoa salad it sat upon, with olives and datesDuck - cooked to a juicy medium rare, with a salted, crispy skin and no other excess fat. It was on a bed of grains and sweet potato puree which compliments it well. They had 2 options for dessert the night we came, and so we tried them both.

4.0,10/18/2013,Burke & Wills is a welcome addition to the UWS bar scene. I have yet to try there food but I saw others eating it around the bar and it looked amazing. The specialty cocktails were incredible and I can't wait to try them all. The staff are all really friendly and Billy the bartender was great at recommending different drinks from there list.,0,0,0,Jamie O.,"Manhattan, NY",0,13,0
4.0,10/16/2013,"Great accommodating staff. small, intimate room. you can feel the warmth from the moment you enter. hubby and I enjoyed the black kale salad and the beef tartare to start. tartare quality was excellent with unique presentation. the kale was just fine but not really memorable. Main course tonight were the roast duck - which was PERFECT and I know I will come back for. The gnocchi was not very good at all but wasn't inedible. Peeped the bar upstairs which is one of the most intimate sexy rooms in a 40 block radius. great for small group to grab drinks in the colder months. Probably the best cocktail list from UWS until the LES. Black tufted leather, rich dark wood, antique mirror, gold and silver accented walls lit by candle, brightened by white marble.  Will be back",0,0,0,Nazli G.,"Manhattan, NY",0,3,0

The front bar area is cozy and the dining room tucked away in the back has a great feel to it--nice but still relaxed. The drinks, food, and service were all excellent and the staff was very welcoming. The menu is still relatively small but prices are reasonable especially on the wine list. Tried the black kale salad and filet that was on special and both were delicious. I will definitely be back!",0,0,0,Ruth S.,"Manhattan, NY",0,4,0

4.0,9/23/2013,"Just tried this with my boyfriend this past weekend.  I live in the neighborhood, and had been excited to check out the new place. The decor is perfect; it's sexy and dark and understated and extremely tasteful.  The food and drinks that we ordered were wonderful.  I had a Gimlet which was smooth and icy cold and very refreshing.  A perfect Friday night happy hour cocktail.  There was one male bartender (whose name I did not catch) who was so professional and talented and mesmerizing to watch (makes it fun to sit at the bar).  We loved the prawns and kale salad, and will come back and order exactly the same thing, and the fries (which the people next to us ordered and smelled so good we said we must come back to try them).  The staff was more than friendly, and the place is a wonderful addition to the neighborhood.  You feel like you are at a secret romantic downtown haunt even though you are in a busy stretch of 79th street.  Highly recommend!",0,0,0,Abby R.,"East Village, Manhattan, NY",0,6,0
5.0,9/8/2013,"My husband and I stopped by for a drink on Sunday afternoon - the cocktails were great, I definitely recommend the Sydney Sour. We enjoyed ourselves so much that we decided to stay and try a couple of items off the menu.  We shared the Prawns On The Plancha and the Roo Burger, both were excellent. Incredibly friendly staff, excellent service, great cocktails, solid menu, and reasonable prices. This place is a WIN!",0,0,0,Jaye W.,"New York, NY",3,15,0
2.0,9/7/2013,"Limited, uninspired menu served in depressing dining room with institutional gray walls and loudly played bad pop from the 1960s and 1970s. Food is a little better than Sunburned Calf, which was in this location previously, but if you're stuck in the restaurant wasteland at 79th and Broadway, FIsh Tag next door is a much better option.",2,0,0,Mike W.,"New York, NY",0,20,0
2.0,9/1/2013,"I miss Sunburnt Calf, it was relaxed, fun and down to earth, like all good Aussie bars should be. I wanted to like Burke & Wills, I really did, but I just feel that it is now become overly pretentious and has really lost the edge that drew the crowds before.I get that it's trying to fit in to an upper class category, but I miss the fun and feeling of home when you used to walk into the place.Prices are now a little higher and brunch is not what it used to be, it's now a try-hard fancy bar with Aussie memorabilia.",6,3,0,Natalie B.,"Manhattan, NY",0,3,0

3.0,8/17/2013,The ambiance is very cozy and quaint in a way. The skylight is nice. The host was a bit snotty describing the lounge upstairs . The place was almost empty and the waiter was efficient and smiling but very much in automatic mode. The fish and side dishes were cooked to perfection but the ingredients were subpar . We were given a complimentary dessert at the end which was a nice gesture but I just took a bite and decided it was not worth the calories. The most interesting thing to me was the bartender (I forgot to ask his name ).,1,0,0,andrea p.,"New York, NY",350,483,951
5.0,8/11/2013,"(Absurdly long review alert) ... This Aussie spot opened a couple weeks ago with very little fanfare, but definitely deserves some love. The main dining room has a great feel - small and tucked away in the back, featuring lots of charcoal gray and vintage black/white framed art, with a huge old-school arched skylight overhead. Drink/food list is small for now but apparently will be expanded once any new-restaurant wrinkles are ironed out. Speaking of drinks, they're nicely balanced and actually pretty of-the-moment in terms of going back to the classics (think gimlet, Tom Collins, whiskey sour, etc.). Wine selections hail largely from New Zealand and are solid representatives of well-known Kiwi labels (Brancott, Fernridge, etc.).As for food, what few flaws exist are more than acceptable at this price point, not to mention at a newly opened spot. We only tried small plates, including ...*Bass ceviche with coconut milk, chiles and either kaffir or mint (can't recall) - strong fish flavor subdued by cool/spicy/herbal dressing. Really interesting.*Beef tartare - excellent anchovy flavor, perfectly sized shards of bovine. More egg and garnish on side would be nice, and toast points would be better than baguette, but those are very minor issues.*Merguez sliders - cooked medium-rare, the rich lamb countered by cool cucumber and soft potato buns with natural sweetness. Brilliant.*Chilled corn soup with crab - not sure I would change anything here. Lovely corn flavor, reasonable amount of shellfish. *Oysters with cucumber mignonette - fresh, clean, what else can you say?*Kale Caesar - finely shredded, studded with fava beans and pumpkin seeds, properly dressed, with fat rectangles of pecorino on top. Win.*Prawns with chimichurri - huge, legitimate prawns in a vibrant sauce. The full-body presentation might be putting form over function, as it's hard to grill shrimp without overcooking while also getting rid of the nastiness between head and body (when deep-frying, that gunk is obliterated and you can happily eat the whole crustacean). That said, the shrimp were cooked very nicely, akin to a steak done medium.Staff was on-point, and oh yeah, they play golden oldies, which deserves a sixth star. Good times.P.S.

5.0,8/6/2013,"Had a really nice experience at dinner on August 6, soon after it opened.   Food was inventive and well executed.  The roast cod  was great and my wife liked the gnocchi.   But, I think the appetizers were our favorite. The steak tartar and lamb sliders were interesting and tasty but not over engineered.  The owner and manager are very engaged and like what they do - true Australians.   We liked the cool but simple room.  We felt comfortable and will go back",1,0,0,Daniel D.,"Warren, NJ",3,69,3
