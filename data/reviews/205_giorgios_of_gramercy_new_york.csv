2.0,4/27/2019,"My aunt and I went to eat here when she was in town as we thought it would be a quiet restaurant to catch up in. It was the opposite of quiet, and the service left much to be desired. The food was okay, but nothing that really stood out. I don't think I will be going back as there are lots of other great restaurants in the area with much better ambiance and food.",0,0,0,Alexis S.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",18,256,16
5.0,4/3/2019,"Came to this restaurant Saturday evening for my moms birthday with a group of nine.  This place packed at 8:30pm, I do recommend that you make a reservation when you come here just to be safe.  With that said, I can honestly say the food here was terrific.  For appetizer, we had grilled octopus, burrata cheese, and dozen oysters.  Now I will say that for a group of nine, that is hardly enough.  But luckily they gave us bread, so that stopped us from eating every item on the appetizer list.For my entree, I had the pan seared Chilean sea bass with coconut curry sauce on a bed of sautéed vegetables.  This dish, all I can is wow.  Words just can't explain how much I loved this dish.  The fish was cooked perfectly, and just the right portion.  We also had the squid ink pasta and the sirloin steak.  I can't get into detail about each dish, but just know it was great.  The service here was phenomenal.  Our waiter was very polite, outgoing and very open to answering all our questions.  Even the manager and the bartender were very polite.  I was trying to find a good bourbon for my cocktail, and they let take many samples so I can find the right combo.  Overall me and my family were very satisfied, and will be sure to come back.1 thing I will point out, for those who aren't used to NY prices.  If you can't afford or if you're expecting a dinner on the lower end of the cost spectrum, then this place isn't for you. Dishes will usually go $26-$45 and cocktails were about $15. But if you do come here you will not be disappointed.",1,0,1,Brandon L.,"East Brunswick, NJ",174,82,260

The owner greeted us, offered to check my coat, and we were taken to our table by our friendly waiter.  He was patient while we tried to decide which of 2 available tables we would like best.  After settling in, he took our drinks order and recognized that we needed a few more minutes to decide what we wanted to eat. He was knowledgeable about the specials and regular menu items. The restaurant was very busy but we didn't feel rushed.  The decor is beautiful and makes a lovely date place. The scallops, mussels and pasta special were delicious.  We ordered dessert but couldn't finish it because we were full from dinner.  We had a very pleasant experience and intend to go back",0,0,0,Marguerite D.,"New York, NY",2,15,2

4.0,1/31/2019,"This might be the coziest spot in the Flatiron area. I've been here a number of times and I always have a wonderful dinner experience. The service is constantly excellent and so is the food. The staff here always make you feel very welcomed and are knowledgeable when it comes to the menu and any specials. A big plus for the great décor it's just super cozy and perfect for a romantic date night! Their pasta dishes are all delicious, and I love that they can all be ordered as appetizers as well. Perfect if you want to try a few dishes. I always end up ordering the burrata appetizer and its very good and fresh. Last time wasn't the best though and don't know if this had anything to do with it being the thanksgiving weekend? But it's usually an excellent appetizer with lots of flavor. For the main course I've had the Pappardelle Ragout and this is probably my all-time favorite. I truly recommend it. My company always ordered the Veal parmesan and it's huge!

2.0,12/14/2018,"Our dinner started out very good. The burrata was very milky, creamy and served with crusty bread. I ordered the ragu, which was a classic, fair dish. When I received my bill, we had a few questions. First of all, there was an added beverage charge, though we had only asked for tap water. When we asked about this, we got neither an explanation nor an apology. We also noticed there was an additional charge for a side of brussel sprouts. I was only surprised because, when I had ordered, the waiter had asked, ""And what would you like as your vegetable?"" Not, ""Would you like a side with that?"" This was very misleading, and felt like a sneaky way to add onto the bill. When we asked him about the language he used, he insisted in a very defensive way, that he had offered it as a side. It wasn't at all important, being that it was a $9 side dish, but I didn't appreciate being misled. He acted like we had ordered a $200 bottle of champagne and were trying to get it for free. Our waiter up until that point had been personable and nice. We still paid for the brussel sprouts.Because that $9 was so important to the restaurant, and they didn't care to make their customers happy, we will not be going back.",2,0,0,Kayla N.,"Atlanta, GA",76,8,5

So skilled and an awesome chit chatter with the best personality-- sarcastic and polite at the same time! I asked for a Bloody Mary chaser a few months ago for my chilled vodka shot and he didn't have any prepared (duh marla, it was 8pm and not brunch time) but he whipped up his own concoction to make me happy and it tasted just like the real thing! He's inventive and strives to make his customers happy :)Great place to come if you're alone because the staff is super cool and will interact with you :)Happy hour - they make their own infused vodkas!!!! No fake syrups. I came here Thursday night and tried their house made grape vodka with seltzer. DAMN it was good. Every week they have a different flavor.The dinner menu here will kick your ass. Had a huge veal shank and split it with my girlfriend not too long ago. Gigantic portion, cheesy and perfectly cooked, tasty + well seasoned!Just come here for Happy Hour drinks at the very least please.

I was so annoyed and just speechless. Here just take the money and eat it. (This is the for delivery service) I guess delivery service isn't up to par because they could care less about losing customers versus in dining. Unless you want your food cold and want to starve first by all means. This place is not worth starving over for delivery plus the frustration. Will not be ordering from this place again.

1.0,9/18/2017,"From the moment we entered, I knew this would not be an enjoyable dinner. The group of musicians, at the entrance, were playing so loudly I knew conversation would be difficult if not impossible. The bar, at the front of the room, leaves little access to the dining area. A fellow standing at the bar seemed irritated as we side-stepped past him, instead of moving out of the way. Our waitress had the annoying habit of placing her hand on my back each time she came to the table. Having an allergy to apples, my wife and I shared the beet salad, which the waitress graciously served with the apple in a separate dish. We waited too long for our salads to be served. The busboy not only cleared the salad dishes but also took all the dinnerware from the table as if we had already finished our entrées. It took an inordinate period of time for our dinners to be served. My Wild King Salmon was served, cooked exactly as ordered. However, the roasted fennel, portobello mushrooms were inedible, tasting several days past their peak of freshness. Unfortunately, the waitress failed to visit our table to ask if everything was okay. The check was brought as desert was served and the waitress came by several times to see if we had paid, long before desert and coffee were finished. I imagine there are those that might enjoy loud music during dinner, making conversation nearly impossible, but for our group, it was simply not acceptable.",0,0,0,Ken T.,"Woodland Hills, Los Angeles, CA",0,55,0

3.0,9/1/2017,"It kills me to have to write this review. Only because the staff is always so friendly and I have been to Giorgio's on multiple occasions in the past did I give it 3 stars, otherwise this past visit warranted 2 stars at most.  Shockingly, the food was the real killer. Showed up for restauraunt week, and ordered the heirloom tomato and mozzarella, the steak, and the sorbet. Companion ordered the mussels, steak, and ice cream trio. He said the mussels were good, not out of this world, but good enough. My appetizer was an absolute mess. It looked beautiful. But the mozzarella so MUSHY. Not super soft like a ball of fresh mozzerella, these were large slices that were of a really watery and odd gel like consistency. Really unappealing. The tomatoes were also mushy and had that overly soft, grainy texture. 0/5 stars for that dish. The steaks came out, and I'll start with the good. Au gratin potatoes were super fantastic. Asparagus tasted good, and the steaks was nice as well except they cooked the daylights out of them. I requested medium rare and told the server the cook could even go rare plus. I like red, red, red meat throughout, and places have a tendency to overcook especially smaller steaks. Mine came out medium well. It was a bit pink in the center. My boyfriends came out medium, it was a brighter pink in the center. This was a 60 min lunch as I had to get back to work, so there was no sending back. Just enjoyed what I could. The sorbet was nice, and the ice cream trio was really good. I don't even like rocky road ice cream, but they made delicious rocky road. We went well after the lunch rush around 2 thinking lack of crowds would have us in and out, but incorrect assumption. 90 mins despite ordering right away and not dallying over courses.The service is always extremely friendly and this was no exception. It was great at the beginning, but at the end everyone took their lunch break and we had to ask for both dessert and the check. We sat there for about 10 mins waiting for dessert and another 15 after finishing it before finally finding someone to ask for our check. The steaks also took over 20 mins to come out, but probably because they were on the grill for so long, haha. The waiter did apologize, and I understand they have to eat too, so this was not much of a bother. The real bummer was the food. Thankfully, since I know how good this place can be, I'll likely give it another shot.",0,0,0,Tracy T.,"Manhattan, NY",2,60,10
3.0,8/17/2017,"Came here for restaurant week with some friends - dinner is 3 courses for $42 before tax and tip. Walking in, I was pretty excited because the pictures on Yelp looked pretty appealing. The restaurant is dim and rather intimate. There was also a band playing live music at the front of the restaurant. For starters, I got the hamachi ceviche, which I didn't like at all. The presentation was good but it was way too citrus I couldn't even taste the fish. For my main, I had the filet mignon, which was alright. It was good but not the best I've had. The spinach was on the saltier side, but the mushrooms and chimichurri sauce were pretty flavorful. The best thing was probably the s'mores bread pudding which I got for my dessert. It tasted more like a warm brownie, paired with vanilla ice cream. It was gooey and rich. You can also get this from the regular menu. Overall, I wasn't very impressed by my restaurant week dining experience here. I didn't feel like there much of a bargain. The service was also pretty mediocre too - our server was impatient and looked like he was in a bad mood. Point is, if you plan to come here for dinner, I would suggest ordering from the regular menu.",2,0,0,Jacqueline C.,"New York, NY",421,209,372
4.0,8/12/2017,"Tried the restaurant week menu and it was pretty good. Salad for appetizer, sea bass for entree, and s'more pudding for dessert. The s'more was the best dish, other two were good too but not as impressive. My husband had the filet mignon and the sorbet, and he loved the sorbet. It was a good deal with restaurant week $42 for 3 courses, but it's not the best restaurant week menu I've had. Overall I'd recommend this place.",0,0,0,Lynn C.,"Weehawken, NJ",1,62,152
3.0,8/11/2017,"I came here for restaurant week dinner (3 courses for $42). The process was pretty seamless. They post their menus online and accept reservations through OpenTable. For $42, the three courses was pretty worth it as individual entrees are ~$30. Upon entering the restaurant, my friend and I were enthusiastically greeted and asked if we would like them to hang up our stuff. Though we declined, that was an unexpected and nice touch.For the restaurant week menu, they have three options for each of the courses. Note, the descriptions on the actual menu at the restaurant slightly differ from the descriptions on the online restaurant week menu. I opted for the hamachi ceviche as my starter, duck breast as my main, and their s'mores bread pudding for dessert. -Hamachi ceviche: The flavors were alright but the acidic taste was way too overpowering. Additionally, within the dish were varying sizes of hamachi pieces, which kind of threw off the balance.-Duck breast: The flavors were well balanced but the duck was a bit too chewy for my taste. I had some of my friend's filet mignon and wished I had ordered that instead. The filet was perfectly seasoned and very tender.-S'mores bread pudding: This was probably my favorite course of the night. However, the dish was more like an ultra fudgey brownie or molten lava cake than bread pudding. Nonetheless, it was sinfully satisfying. Overall, I thought my experience at Giorgio's was okay. The food was decent but in no way outstanding. Additionally, our waiter seemed very impatient when we asked for a few more minutes to peruse the menu and was short with us while taking our order. That being said, the rest of the staff we encountered that night, were very nice. Perhaps, the items on the regular menu are better, but based on my initial taste of Giorgio's, I'm not rushing to return.",2,0,1,Jillian L.,"New York, NY",408,323,132

3.0,8/7/2017,"I came here for their restaurant week special (3 course lunch for $29), which is not much different than the regular prix fixe lunch menu on their website (3 courses for $30). The service was wonderful. Our enthusiastic waitress brought us bread and olives right away and was quick to fill up our drinks. The atmosphere felt a little old school and was very different from other spots in Gramercy or Flatiron that I hit up for lunch. I ordered the calamari to start, sea scallops as my main meal, and the famous s'mores bread pudding for dessert. As though that wasn't enough food, I threw in an order of french fries as well. The calamari was delicious and the portion was pretty generous, and I was pleased with the scallops. I was a little disappointed by the s'mores bread pudding, though it seemed like my dining companion and I were the outliers here. Every other table around us (funny enough, all women) had ordered the same dessert and were raving about it to one another. We thought it was a bit too rich and heavy, and it tasted far more like a dark fudge brownie than bread pudding. I'm not sure where the s'mores part came in, as I didn't see anything related to marshmallows on mine. I absolutely love bread pudding and order it whenever I see it on a restaurant menu, so I'm likely pickier than most.",6,3,4,Kirsten H.,"Denver, CO",181,990,827

Greeted by a very welcoming host and were seated right away. Our waitress came by with menus and water asap and was super accommodating. Food was great, I definitely enjoyed every dish I tried, even though the octopus and scallops were a bit burnt and over cooked, but flavor profile was on point. My grilled octopus was extremely charred on some parts and made it hard to eat but it was delicious when you ate around it. It came on a bed of very refreshing citrus salad with oranges; a weird combination but oddly addictive. My scallops were unevenly cooked (some were visibly tougher/over cooked and some were perfect) but the taste was still 5 stars. And cocktails. They tasted like straight up shots. Which I can't really complain, I commend them for not going cheap on the liquor. But we weren't trying to get drunk, just trying to talk and eat dinner, so we sipped on our drinks.

I ordered the cinnamon  bourbon orange  drink. Really kicked in. Farm salad was delicious but I could have sworn it said olives but got radishes. The dressing was perfect.  Octopus was tasty but very small portion. They are very accommodating on special orders. Veal parmigiana  on the bone was HUGEEEEE but came out ""Luke Warm"" which the manager repeated to my husband which I thought was condensing. They did reconcile the problem. No biggy.

5.0,5/24/2017,"I came here for Restaurant week lunch, and was truly wowed by the food here. I came with my roommate for an end-of-exams lunch, and we both had things to do and places to be afterwards so I found a place not too far away from our school in Midtown. This place had good reviews on Yelp and wide-open reservations with a good vegetarian option (she's vegetarian), so I figured why not. The restaurant is tucked away on one of the less busy streets near Madison Square Park, but was not hard to find. The host was very polite, and seated us immediately during the not-too-busy lunch hour (our Open Table reservation was for 11:30AM on a Friday). He asked us our preference of seating between the front or the back part of the long dining room, and we told him to choose for us. He chose the front, which turned out to be the better option because it was quieter and more intimate because we could hear each other talk. We got the prix-fixed Restaurant week lunch, myself the lobster bisque to start, pan-seared scallops for entrée, and bread pudding as dessert. She got the vegetarian lasagna to start, pumpkin ravioli for entrée, and bread pudding as well for dessert. We were seated right next to the kitchen, so it was fun seeing all the different dishes come out as we waited for ours. The bread was okay; I prefer warm/toasted bread but it was still good. My friend loved the olives they brought out with the bread, so that was a plus! Our food came out pretty quickly, and we both enjoyed our appetizers immensely. The bisque was creamy and not too salty which I loved, and the giant biscotti floating around was fun too. Her veggie lasagna had SO many layers, hard to imagine how much effort went into making those layers so thin. Well done! Our entrees were both delicious, her pumpkin ravioli was very special and sweet, paired well with the cream sauce it came with. My scallops were SO good, the sautéed cauliflower/sauce reduction really made the dish - sweet, tangy, savory, a good mix of flavors. I was excited to see their take on bread pudding and my friend had never had it, and boy was this a hard bread pudding to top now that it has set her standards so high! It was pretty much a chocolate brownie with bread pieces, making it less dense and more fluffy. The crunch chocolate beads on top were delicious!

3.0,2/11/2017,"3.5 stars.  Came here for restaurant week 2017 dinner with my boyfriend, and while things were generally fine and the food good, I wasn't that impressed (I think the server just threw me off, more on that below) hence the round down to 3.Ambience: We really liked the ambience; the restaurant is cute, lively and dimly lit, so that was nice.Service: When we sat down it took 10 min for the server to come over and acknowledge us. While she was pleasant, seeing her run around made her seem very overwhelmed. On the plus side we were served water right away by someone and they refilled our glasses quickly.We ordered our drinks and food at the same time because we could tell things were going to be slow.  It took at least 15 minutes for our drinks to come, which arrived when we were halfway done our appetizers.  The server was not very knowledgeable about allergies either. My boyfriend has a gluten allergy and ordered a negroni, specifying it can't be made with Bombay sapphire, which isn't gluten free. She came back to our table 10 minutes later saying none of their gins are gluten free. When we asked what gin they have, she didn't know so went and got a list.  My boyfriend has had St George before and knows it's okay so asked for that. She apologized and said they just couldn't guarantee their gins were gluten free, okay so don't lie to us saying they're not when we know at least one is fine.  She then came back another time asking if Campari and vermouth were okay for him... he ordered a negroni, I think he knows whether he can drink the elements that make up the drink. As far as food, she checked things with the kitchen, which I guess is better than her lying and saying he could eat certain dishes.When our drinks came, we ordered our wine that we wanted with our main dish, since we assumed that would take another 20 minutes.  The server was apologetic and sweet, but the process was still annoying.Food: We ordered off the restaurant week menu, which was obviously a great deal and the food was pretty good.I got the beets for my starter, which were really flavorful. The dressing was delicious and the crunchiness from the almonds was great. I forgot to say no Gorgonzola (I really don't like stinky cheese), but it didn't overpower the dish which was good.My boyfriend got the sausage trio, which they said was gluten free and he enjoyed. He did say 2 of them were slightly too charred and over cooked though.For the main, we both ordered the New York Strip, which came out to a nice medium rare. There was a huge slab of butter on top, which was good but a little much. The steak was also huge and fatty, which is to be expected for a NY strip.  It was quite flavorful and the fries were yummy.  My boyfriend got mashed potatoes because the fries weren't gluten free, which was nice of them to do since sometimes you don't get substitutions with restaurant week.For dessert I ordered the S'mores bread pudding, which was the highlight for me and was AMAZING. I love smores and this was on point. The crunchiness, the gooeyness and chocolate all went together perfectly.My boyfriend got the gelato (without the wafer), which he enjoyed.Overall, nothing tasted bad or excellent and the service was just OK. If I was paying full price and not restaurant week prices it would've been a 3 instead of 3.5 (though, I rounded down anyway so technically I did give 3 stars).  Maybe we'll be back eventually to try their tasting menu, which also seemed like a pretty good deal.",1,2,2,Elyka A.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",198,204,634

4.0,2/8/2017,"I went to Giorgio's last week with some friends for a surprise birthday dinner for one of our friends.  We made the reservation last minute, but the staff treated us as if we were regular, long-time customers.  One of us arrived about 30 minutes before the reservation, but she was seated and taken care of politely, professionally and efficiently.  By the time all but the birthday girl arrived, the hostess had checked in with us to see how she could help us with the surprise.  When our friend came in, the hostess was in on the ruse and was able to ""trick"" our friend right up until she got to our table.  It was an extra effort on the hostess' part and much appreciated by all of us.  From that point, service was spot on, food was very good and we were able to enjoy ourselves without feeling rushed.  Overall, it was an excellent experience and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend Giorgio's to anyone.  I'm looking forward to returning.  Thanks to everyone there who gave us a really nice evening!",0,0,0,Jill B.,"Astoria, NY",1,25,1

So we all got the sausage appetizer, and it was a good start to a three course meal. Then we all got the steak bc it was 16oz and huge. However, this table next to us got the sea bass, and the aroma wafted over to where we were sitting, and I kind of regretted not getting the sea bass. The only complaint with the steak was that my friend ordered a medium rare and received a rare, and my other friend ordered medium well and received well done. I stuck with medium, and mine was fine LOL. Felt like goldilocks because my steak was just right. We finished of with dessert, each trying something new this time. The gelato was amazing!

It was essentially a bisque with a small seafood flavor.For my entree, I got a duck. Well-seared and crispy skin. My only gripe with the duck was that I wished it came with some sort of a side - maybe roasted carrots, mashed potatoes, or something blander that could cut into the duck a little bit.I also tried my friend's steak. It was a very standard rib, so not much to say there.Anyways - not a bad meal, but also nothing too crazy.",1,0,0,Willy X.,"New York, NY",873,222,74
5.0,1/30/2017,"I just came here for dinner (Restaurant Week dinner) and it was phenomenal. Which is kind of crazy since so many restaurants these days don't really seem to *want* people to come for Restaurant Week. I don't know why that is either. I'm assuming that they think people just come for the discounted price and will never return, but that's such inane logic because I will absolutely return here. I'll never understand why some other places (ahem American Cut) will put out a Restaurant Week menu and then scoff at you for actually using it. Makes zero sense to me.Anyway, each course was memorable as hell. The highlights? The Alex Friar Soup was heavenly. My boyfriend (someone who hates mushrooms) tried mine and regretted not getting it himself. He refused to believe there were mushrooms in it! He kept calling it a ""smoky taste"" that he loved. Ha! It was most definitely mushrooms. The New York Strip was so tasty (but really, if a New York Strip isn't tasty, then something is horribly wrong in the kitchen), but the real highlight for me was the Chilean Sea Bass. I love that fish. Love it like a mother. There is no wrong that fish can do. And it was lovely as hell here. The desserts were good as well, but honestly the starter and main outshone everything.

Glad you have this coupon, it will give you a lot of great options for dinner!""  We were very pleased.  Our waiter James was fantastic and had great suggestions for us. The food was very, very good.  We had the roasted oysters which were amazing, the New York Strip, and the Ribeye. Everything was cooked perfectly.  Do not miss the S'more Bread Pudding!So we liked this place so much and had such a great experience we actually decided to return the second night of our NYC visit. Our original plan for the trip was to wander around the city and find someplace new try that we had not been to in NYC before but it was a snowy/rainy night and we had had such a great experience at Giorgio's the night before we decided to return. Besides, there were some dishes we really wanted to try we didn't have the night before! We sat at the bar for dinner (something we like to do, we didn't even ask for a table) and Brock the bartender took great care of us. The staff seemed quite touched we had decided to return for a second night. James our waiter from the night before recognized us at the bar and came over to say hello, he even remembered our names!  My wife and I both had the Sea Scallops, an amazing dish. The second night was another great experience!This restaurant is something special. In speaking to the staff we learned they are treated very well by the owner as well and all really seem to like working there which shown through in the whole experience.

When the air conditioning turned back on, large chunks and pieces of this black dust shot all over table and water and also the table next to us. We asked to be moved and they obliged. The server tried to give us our dirty water that had dust in it. You could see all the tables along the wall where the cooling system ran above them had black soot. A woman who was sitting at one of these tables got up and had black streaks all over her white pants.Irregardless of this, the food was just ok. The lunch menu is a little all over the place in terms of theme. The Gelato comes in a small serving dish with one scoop and is $10 which is honestly one of the biggest rip offs I have ever seen in a restaurant.

5.0,6/16/2016,"I had been looking on Yelp for the best scallops in NYC for my mom. I found Giorgio's of Gramercy and decided to give it a try after checking out the menu, reviews, and their website.Service: I had made a reservation on Friday June 10 via OpenTable for Sunday June 12. I had received a call Saturday from the hostess calling to confirm. Upon arrival we were seated and accommodated to a table for two.Ambiance/Appearance: The restaurant is of medium size with nice lighting and beautiful chandeliers and decorations. Good place to have a conversation or take a date, but also not too quiet or boring.Food: Since I had hand selected this restaurant for their rave reviews for their scallops ($29), my mother ordered them and I a mixed greens salad ($10). My mother ordered a glass of pinot grigio and I ordered the spicy margarita. My cocktail was spicier than I had anticipated. We kindly asked the hostess (who was helping out what seemed to be the only waitress) if we could possibly get just a plain margarita. She was very understanding and agreed with a big, warm smile. They frequently check up on you to make sure everything is going well (which is a good thing). My mother loved the sea scallops with the creamy sauce, raisins, greens, and I believe almonds. My mixed greens salad was delicious!

I went here for my bf's birthday through a recommendation of a friend and I don't regret it. The staff was super sweet and happy to be there. The waiter was knowledgeable about the menu and described all the foods very well,  explaining what they are known for, what pairings to have with the appetizers you order and for the entrees. The oysters had so many individual flavors that when you took bite you get everything at once and it all complimented each other especially the truffle butter made it. Can't get anything better than that! I had their mussels and keep in mind that the mussels were apps but when i tell you these mussels were larger than the size of blue point oysters. They were the biggest mussels I've ever had and they were paired with white wine, garlic and butter soup base with going of chili flakes. The chili flakes added some heat to the dish which was really nice. There were about 12 huge sets of mussels and after eating 5-6 i was already full cause of how meaty they were. My bf ordered a skirt steak that just was amazing from what he said. The knife cut through so smoothly and he p.s. always has a hard time cutting into steak, haha.

I love burrata, but the oysters really stole the show. If I remembered the menu more clearly I would attempt to describe it but honestly no words could do them justice anyway. For our entrees I had the scallops, which I'm still thinking about. Other people had the ribeye, porterhouse steak for two, lamb chops, and salmon. I had some of everything and I loved it all. The scallops were my favorite, which was not surprising as it was very well prepared, and satisfied a craving I've had for months while trapped in the culinary desert that is Rutgers (only a slight exaggeration). However, I was not fond of the sauce that it was served with.The ribeye steak was the next best. It was served with bone marrow mashed potatoes, which, wow. So good!

The staff is kind and they know their stuff- they go out of their way to make sure you have a great experience. And the food- I truly have not had a better, more satisfying meal. I just love their menu. I really can't say enough good things. They have whatever you are in the mood for and they do it well.

4.0,2/17/2016,Walked into the restaurant on a Wednesday night after work at around 6:30pm and sat at the bar...I wanted to eat something light and have a few drinks...my first impression was hmm this place is kind of dark. I figured they wanted a romantic feel so ok with me. The young man that greeted me at the bar was very pleasant. He handed me both drinking and food menu. I was happy to see that they have happy hour wine until 7pm for $5 so I ordered two glasses  of wine. That was exciting! They also have a happy hour food menu. I ordered the thick cut bacon which was delicious!  I also ordered the grilled octopus (no bueno) from the regular menu. I felt like I was masticating on chewing gum. I don't recommend it. I then ordered the chocolate smores  dessert. Let me tell you! It gave me LIFE after a long day at work. Definitely have to try it! All together I give it at 4 because of the octopus and one of the waitress that looked at me strangely when I walked in the door.,9,4,1,Emilio C.,"Jersey City, NJ",4,1,1
4.0,2/15/2016,"Went to Giorgio's for the first time in Valentine's Day... We had a reservation for 5:30pm and were promptly seated in the back of the restaurant. I loved where we sat as I was able to see the entire restaurant. It was perfectly decorated and suited for the holiday with shiny red walls and curtains, sparkling chandeliers and dim lighting. It was truly a romantic setting. Our server was very nice and knowledgeable. We started with two cosmopolitans created with the house-made orange infused vodka. The cosmos were small and the lime was huge but they were tasty. They also served some thin sliced toasted sesame Italian bread with olive oil. We then ordered the small dish of lobster mac n cheese. $17 It was absolutely the best lobster mac n cheese I ever did have. For dinner, I ordered a special of the day- Chilean Sea Bass with chunks of potatoes on the side. $34 My companion ordered the NY strip off the menu. $32 The sea bass was beautifully presented but unfortunately, the potatoes were under cooked and the fish was too salty with a rubbery consistency.  Due to the high volume in the restaurant, when asked how I liked it, I said it was 'ok'. My companion's steak was absolutely delicious. It had a perfect char on the outside and was very juicy and flavorful. I ended up eating some of his. When asked if we wanted another round of cocktails, I went for a glass of white wine instead. He brought me out what he recommended and I must say, it was a delicious wine. The server then asked if we cared for dessert but we declined. My companion then informed him that the fish was salty and the potatoes were under cooked. He thought it best to let the server know so he wouldn't recommend to other patrons. The server then went above and beyond by removing $15 off the check and bringing us out some after dinner drinks on the house. Total bill $119.Overall, it was a good meal, beautiful environment and excellent service. :)",1,0,0,Nicole D.,"Plainfield, NJ",131,45,71

My wife called earlier and they told us that if we wanted to eat here on V-day that we would be able to sit at the bar with no problem. Igor was his name and he was slinging cocktails for all of the thirsty patrons.  My wife and I ordered drinks, (Jalapeno infused Tequila Margarita & Pomengranite Rum Martini), both house infused libations, both fantastic.  They use fresh squeezed juice in every cocktail, fresh fruit, giant blocks of ice & a lot of flair.  It was highly entertaining to watch the bartender make those drinks.  Igor was highly knowledgeable about every single beverage and food item we inquired about.  We shared an order of Burrata which was absolutely out of this world.  It has this sweet fig jam underneath with a little bit of Arugula on the top.  I ordered the veal parm (enough for two even 3 people) and my wife ordered the seared scallops which were cooked to perfection.  We didn't have to ask for anything sitting at the bar.  The bartender was extremely busy however he managed to juggle everything behind that bar.  The food, the drinks, the atmosphere, the staff and the surrounding crowd were all a 10/10.  Looking forward to going back the next time we want an amazing meal.  The meal was absolutely worth every dollar.",1,0,0,Ryan B.,"Staten Island, NY",172,13,0
2.0,2/14/2016,"For the most part, we were not satisfied with this experience. We did have a reservation of 11 people (for a birthday dinner) at 9pm and were sat within a reasonable amount of time, so that was nice. However, it took 35 minutes after we were seated and given menus to get our drinks, and took another 10 minutes to even take our food order. We then didn't receive our bread until 50 minutes into the reservation, and the waiter never brought out the pepper to add into the olive oil. Finally, after an hour and 15 minutes of sitting there, we received our food. The quality of the food wasn't too bad, but nothing special (however, I am quite picky with pasta, I will admit). They did provide a nice birthday dessert for our friend as well as bringing out an extra one for the rest of the group, which was really nice and really struck me, so props on that (it was the S'Mores thing and was pretty decent). However, it took a while for them to get the receipt and even longer for them to process it.

4.0,2/6/2016,"Walking into Giorgio's of Gramercy is gangsta. You push past a thick curtain, once inside its a warm and inviting space. Dark red walls and more curtains, very intimate. Some people like the open kitchen, I'm not sure if I'm a fan. We're met by the hostess and seated in the back by the open kitchen.I have to start talking about the dessert. Both my son & I ordered the S'more bread pudding. Outrageous! From the decadent valrhona chocolate and topped with vanilla gelato, this was by far my favorite dish at Giorgio's of Gramercy.Now I know this is an Italian place. We're all in the mood for steak! I started with the bone marrow appetizer. It was ok, it came with a few small pieces of bread. Do you know who loved this dish? My dogs. And the kitchen staff was nice enough to give me a second bone for my other doggie :)My wife didn't want to eat a big steak so she ordered the Giorgio burger. It had a nice beef blend with Gruyere and caramelized onions. She raved about the burger.My son and I ordered the New York Strip steak. Normally, Im not a fan of this steak cut. It's big but to me its flavorless. Not so at Giorgio's of Gramercy. What the chef did and its very creative, the steak was topped with a herbed butter cap. The heat of the meat slowly melted the butter which added depth to the steak. Mmmmm mmmm! The french fries were good but we were all attacking my wife truffle fries.

The uni was not fresh and the mash just tasted like mash. The steak frites was good. The meat was tender and cooked well. The roasted oysters were ok, I'm not a huge fan of cooked oysters. The pappardelle was also just ok, The pasta didn't have that velvety smoothness of great fresh pasta.

We've been coming here for a couple years now, and it's always been an excellent experience. The only reason why I have not given this restaurant five stars is because it seems as though management has changed recently, and the last experience we had here was poor. We made a reservation for my fiancée's birthday, and when we checked in the hostess told us we would need to ""give her back the table"" less than ninety minutes later because ""it's restaurant week"". Sorry, but if you have to take back tables from people enjoying their dinner, you're not managing the restaurant correctly. What an absolute buzz kill. We sat down, looked at each other, and decided that we were so turned off that we needed to leave. We ended up making a reservation somewhere else, and leaving within ten minutes.

I didn't know I could say this about Mac & Cheese. Or cheese in general ever. I love cheese but not to this excess. The dish needs to tone it down. The bread was so delicious and mildly sweet. The quality of the bread basket is kind of a big deal to me. To finish off the meal, I shared the Baked Alaska. Perhaps, it was just not my thing.

It wasn't fresh. People seemed to like the vegetable lasagna but there were mixed reviews on the scallops.

After much digging and reading reviews, this place really stuck out to me and I wanted to check it out. I made reservations for 9 p.m. including in the reservation that my boyfriend and I are celebrating our anniversary. We arrived early at about 8:45 p.m. and the hostess working on Friday night was not very friendly. She told us that it would be really helpful to her if we took a seat at the bar until we can be seated, which is absolutely fine but there is a nicer way to put that. We sat at the bar until about 9:10 p.m. and my boyfriend was getting really hungry and impatient at that point. The hostess was not too concerned about us still sitting at the bar and didn't even come up to us to inform us about our table. We were finally seated at a corner table by the window. Upon being seated we waited another 15 or 20 minutes before receiving menus. The hostess seated another couple next to us who were seated and given menus immediately. I thought this was very rude and my boyfriend asked her why we hadn't received our menus yet. The owner came up to us after and apologized and was extremely warm and nice, sending us a complimentary appetizer. The rest of the night ended up being very enjoyable. The food was very delicious. I ordered the veggie lasagna and beet salad and my boyfriend had the NY strip and mushroom soup, which was excellent. The cocktails were interesting and tasty as well. Our server, I believe his name was Doyle (sp?) was very friendly and helpful. He helped us select our entrees and order drinks.

I waited approximately 1 hour for my entrée to show up and I was quite aggravated since I had to head back to work. When my filet mignon finally came, it was cooked inconsistently. I asked for medium rare but only one part of it came out to be medium rare and the rest of it was more towards medium. I feel like this place can have a better management and should be more prepared for busy times. The waitresses should know how to handle the customers and not to try to avoid as much as they can.

James if you're reading this, keep doing what you do because you rock at it. 5/5Quality of Food: I would recommend any if not all of these dishes to try.Roasted Oysters w/ Poached Shallots & Black Truffle Compound Butter- these are so darn good. I'd say you have to try them to experience but these oysters have good texture and especially when paired with the lemon juice. The portion is just enough to get you started on your journey. 5/5Sea Scallops- this dish will bring your palate so much delight when you eat the scallops with the balsamic glaze. It gives it this really hard roasty taste and when paired with the scallops soft and chewy texture makes an incredibly enjoyable dish. 5/5Veal Parmesan- coming over from the summer 2015 menu, we were able to order this even with our deal and I'll warn you, you might need to take some home after. This dish is the perfect combination of veal and marinara topped capellini. This dish is not heavy and you'll enjoy the crusted veal with the marinara sauce. 5/5S'more Bread Pudding- Gelato? Check.

When we finally reached the hostess, she asked if we wanted to check in our jackets, and then walked us down the narrow corridor towards our table. The seats were comfortable, but i felt like they sat us way too close to another table of four; we might as well have joined in on their conversation or vice versa.     For starters, we skipped appetizers and went straight for the entrees. My friend ordered the Baked Macaroni. It had brocoli in it, and it tasted like it was made with just cheddar cheese. Not much to talk about there. I ordered the Linguini and a Porterhouse Steak for 2. On the menu, the porterhouse comes along with two sides. I asked the waiter if i could cancel the two sides and just exchange for the linguini. He told me no; i forget the bullshit excuse he gave me. I told him to bring me the linguini anyways. They brought out my linguini first, very fast actually. I love a lot of permassian cheese on my pasta, and i like to continuously sprinkle some while im eating. However, the waiter told us he wasnt allowed to leave the container at our table. Its almost like that one container was meant to serve the entire restaurant; how expensive can permassian cheese be? On the menu, the linguini was described as having shrimp and lobster within it. It definately had shrimp, but i think i mightve bit into just 1 piece of lobster; thats a big maybe. To be honest, it barely even had any linguini; just a shitload of sauce. I felt so cheated; i didnt even bother to make an attempt at finishing the sauce with the cold complimentary slices of bread they gave us. When my steak finally came out, it was a descent size, but definately not the 44 oz the waiter told us. As usual, everyone around me gave me that look like ""how the hell is he going to finish that?"". The filet mignon side was definately great, but the other half of the steak was just ok; a little fattier than im accustomed to.     Afterwards for dessert, my friend and I shared the Smore Bread Pudding. It wasnt what we expected. Its pretty much just lava cake with one of those cookies you eat regular smores with. I dont understand why the great reviews on it. I took a few bites and let my friend eat the rest of it.     Overall, the lighting is dim, which makes this place somewhat good for a date. However, the decor wasnt anything extravagent.

5.0,9/29/2015,"It's taken me 20 years to write this review (the first fifteen were because Yelp wasn't invented yet).  The other five were because I'm selfish and didn't want to tell anyone about this place.  We took our cousins from Italy there the other night and after our dinner, they deserve the accolades.  This is, without question, my favorite restaurant in Manhattan.  The food is perfectly prepared, each piece on the plate were paired together like close friends, We shared a Burrata cheese appetizer with fig jam.  I had lamb belly, (think braised pork belly but a step up on the awesome scale). My wife's branzino was spectacular (actually I was amazed she shared it with me). Our cousins had the Pork chop and the pappardelle and they loved it.  But as good as that was, the service was spectacular!  This is a team that understands how important it is to take care of their customers. We were walk-ins and were treated like the most important customers there. The staff was polite, knowledgeable and professional during our meal.  They smile, they laugh, the make you feel welcome.  A good sign is two doors down, was a restaurant run by Bobby Flay.  It's been gone for 10 years and Giorgio's is still there.  You can go over a block towards South Park and eat at more famous restaurants, but your going to pay more money for less quality.",1,1,1,Mike S.,"Hurley, NY",54,41,8
3.0,9/23/2015,"More like 3.5 stars.Food was overall really great.  Not a good menu for vegetarians though -- very little selection.-Beet salad - really unique flavor combination that all came together beautifully.-Tuna tartar - not really tartar -- comes out more like bits of seared tuna.  But very good.-Sea Scallops - perfectly cooked.-Veal Parmagiana -- OMG, biggest portion EVER.  Like 3 people could eat this.-Baked Macaroni - this was okay, nothing great.-Brussel Sprouts - pretty good.  Dijon pairs nicely with the bitterness of the veggie.Dessert: Tres leches cake - okay, not great.  The smores bread pudding was pretty good, but nothing amazing.  They gave us one free because we were celebrating a birthday.  :)The ambiance here is a little weird.  When you first walk in, this place seems to be dark and romantic, but they play techno beats that kind of feels like you're in a weird discotheque club and cheapens the feel of the place.  The decor is also a little all over the place -- red walls and something about it seems a little cluttered.  Just seemed a bit outdated and doesn't have modern finesse overall.Our server was genuinely super friendly and always trying to be helpful.  The bartender seemed really knowledgeable but came off as a little too serious.  But nonetheless helpful and got the job done.",0,0,0,Latef X.,"New York, NY",37,576,652
2.0,9/14/2015,"Is this place supposed to be that good? Did I go on an off night? I came here this past Friday for dinner. One of my close college friends was in town, so he gathered people to meet up and have dinner, and one of his friends suggested this place.First off, the entrance is narrow. RIght away there is the bar to the right, but you have to walk past the bar to see the maitre'd. Overall the place is small, crowded, and dark. Our group was seated midway into the restaurant. The service was very accommodating as we had 1 more person arriving later than we indicated, so they were able to squeeze an extra chair for us. They offered a prix-fixe menu, but our group decided to order a bunch of apps to share and then order our own entrees.For a drink, I ordered something called the Bourbon Sour....Now i knew that it was going to be sour, but damnnnnnn. One sip of this, and it looks like you want to pucker up with the girl in front of you (not in a pleasant way). I forced myself to down this drink quickly so I could order a whiskey on the rocks afterwards.For apps, we shared the Burrata, Fritto Misto, Avocado Toast, and Octopus. I have the say that the Burrata and Octopus were well prepared....They were the top dishes of the night. The burrata was creamy and mild. The Fritto Misto was your average deep fried assortment of calamari, zucchini and shrimp. It was forgettable. The octopus was plump and juicy and cooked to perfection. It came with a tasty frisee salad as well. I didn't try the avocado toast, but everyone who did try it said it wasn't good. It was probably because it was sitting on the ticket window for ages...the waiter totally forgot about it...For an entree, I had the Sea Scallops. The cauliflower fondue/puree was the best part of the dish. The scallops I had were of various sizes, which resulted in uneven cooking. Some of my scallops were straight up burnt, so all i tasted was the char. The plumper ones were cooked better, but overall this dish was not satisfying. I wouldn't order it again.For dessert, we didn't order anything, but I think our waiter felt bad for us. He hooked us up with free desserts, which I believe was the s'more bread pudding. It was way too rich and decadent. One can easily get diabetes and a cavity from eating it all.I don't know. Two of the people in our group indicated this place is usually good, but I don't know if I'd want to come back....It may have been an off night, but the damage has been done.",1,0,1,Thomas A.,"Watertown, MA",329,895,435
4.0,8/30/2015,"I've seen Giorgio's of Gramercy offering deals after deals on various sites (livingsocial, groupon, restaurant.com) - it's a shame because the foods and service are actually outstanding. Serving traditional classics - my bestie and I shared a full dinner portion of veal ragu pappardelle and pan seared scallops. Both dishes were on par/maybe even better than the finest restaurants in the city. My only regret dining that night was not ordering a full portion of each for myself (sharing such yummy food was wayyy hard). The beautifully cooked pappardelle served with generous chunks of melt in your mouth veal meat, smothered in house made tomato sauce, and baked with a layer of gooey buffalo mozzarella - heavenly! Fist sized, juicy, tender scallops over a bed of cauliflower, almond puree - out of the world! Service was warm, welcoming, and attentive. The whole dining experience felt as if we were teleported to a local, authentic restaurant back in Italy.

The kitchen was open- so you very well may leave here smelling like food. The hostess was sweet, and helpful with getting us seated.  The waiter was very friendly and came to take our drink order immediately.  My drink came first before the one other person in my party's.  We waited about 15 minutes before making eye contact with the waiter who brought it immediately afterwards.  We ordered the baked mac and cheese with chorizo as an appetizer. It was tasty.  I ordered the lamb medium. My party member ordered the pork chop.  The lamb tasted very gamey and flavorless. And i love lamb!!! I couldnt eat it.  Tried the polenta on the plate and it tasted like polenta mixed with a pound of butter.  I couldnt eat this either.  The beet on the plate was okay. This i was able to manage.  The bites of pork chop i tried was better than the lamb.  But nothing over the top.  The restaurant did offer us dessert on the house.... And seemed to care why i didnt like the dish.  I really commend them for trying to make our dining experience more enjoyable.  The tiramisu was great- as was the smore bread pudding.

4.0,8/16/2015,"** Restaurant Week Summer 2015 Review ** Giorgio's is amazing and a life-saver! I originally had reservations for Perry St. for dinner with my cousin and her boyfriend. The day of, I found out they had changed their menu and now the items I wanted to try weren't on it anymore. We were strapped for options since dinner was just 5 hours away and we needed to find someone who could take us. A quick search led us to Giorgio's, which is one of two restaurants we were interested in that had open reservations at prime dinner time. We arrived early and took a seat at the bar, which offers Happy Hour daily from 4-7pm (all night on Mondays). Beers are $3 and wines and infusions are $5 each - super friendly happy hour prices! We were seated right away and given ample time to look everything over. We ordered pretty much the same meals - my cousin and I both had the Tuna Tartare and the Lobster Risotto. We differed in our desserts: I had the S'mores Bread Pudding and she ordered the SorbetTrio. The two boyfriends had the Romaine Hearts, Roasted Cod (catch of the day) and the Key Lime Cheesecake. Appetizers were phenomenal - I thoroughly enjoyed my Tuna Tartare - it kind of reminded me of Tuna Poke but with seaweed at the bottom. I really liked the added crunch/crispy of the seaweed. While I enjoyed my Lobster Risotto, I really, really liked the Roasted Cod. It came over a bed of mashed potatoes with a jalapeño/carrot glaze and cilantro. The mashed potatoes was perfect with the smooth cod. Super good. Desserts were a bit disappointing after the great beginnings of the meal, which is why I'm giving them 4 stars. The key lime cheesecakes were just okay and the S'mores Bread Pudding was a bit too heavy - the vanilla gelato wasn't enough to temper out the heavy chocolate flavor. Service was attentive and we were given enough time between courses to chat and catch up. I'd return again, no doubt about that. But maybe I'll skip dessert and grab something else nearby next time.",2,2,1,Michelle T.,"New York, NY",367,1165,1125

5.0,8/10/2015,"My boyfriend and I were staying at a hotel in the area and came here based on the great Yelp reviews and their Restaurant Week offerings.We made a reservation for 5:30 and ended up getting there around 5:15--which actually worked out perfectly, because it gave us time to sit at the bar and enjoy their happy hour! The HH here is a great deal--$5 for their house infusions and $7 for cocktails. We had two cocktails and my boyfriend also had their cherry-infused gin. The bartender was super friendly and happily talked to us about their aging and infusion process. He also really talked up their barrel-aged cocktails, especially the Manhattan, which they were sadly out of when we went!For dinner, we had both had the tuna tartare to start, which was so yummy--it comes on a bed of seaweed with some friend wonton bit on the side. I had the lobster risotto as my entree, while my boyfriend got the veal--both were really good as well! The veal, in particular, was good and makes me more willing to try veal options in the future, even though it's typically not my favorite cut. For dessert, I had the key lime cheesecake and he had the s'mores bread pudding. The cheesecake was so creamy and good and the key lime was perfectly tangy without being over tang-y. The s'more bread pudding was really good too, judging by how quickly my boyfriend wolfed it down!The service was INCREDIBLE the entire time, super attentive and kind.

Their drinks are very unique because most of them are infused! We tried the cucumber infused gin, the blueberry infused vodka, and the watermelon infused gin all with a splash of tonic and little lime. Their drinks are incredibly refreshing. After a couple drinks, we headed over to our table which was very intimate. We ordered the tuna tartare and the salad for the appetizer. The salad was not anything special, but the tuna tartare was delicious! I could eat their seaweed salad all day. For the main entree, we had the veal and their fish of the day which happened to be a pan seared cod. Both dishes were absolutely well made! The veal was filling and seasoned perfectly. The fish was so soft and buttery. We are not dessert people, but since it was part of the deal, we ordered the gelato and the smores bread pudding, surprisingly, they were both pretty good and not too overly sweet.

This is my new favorite place to eat & I'm bringing all of my friends and family here every chance I get! The food was the best, they actually had food choices that I could order without having the cook supplementing or holding out every other ingredient used for the dish. There are appetizers I could actually eat and enjoy. I did not have to ask for olive oil because it was already on the table. Let's talk about how attentive the servers are...AMAZING CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!!! The manager was so wonderful & made sure me & my friend were taken care of and even offered suggestions from the menu. The ambiance was THE BEST!!! The best music ever, it was very classy & quaint & quiet. No obnoxious raunchy music, the decor was beautiful & everything was clean, not like most restaurants in NYC. The staff were not rude nor obnoxious. It was just the perfect experience. I could go on about the meal, the dessert, & everything. We were made to feel sooooo comfortable.

4.0,4/1/2015,"When we walked in, we were pleasantly greeted and seated by our hostess. Our waiter (James) was very nice and he knew the menu and his wines. The appetizers were pretty good. We had the roasted oysters and fried calamari/shrimp platter. I was told (because I don't like oysters) that they were very good. The only issue is that the ""sauce"" was more of an oil. I also found it strange that they served mashed potatoes with it. The calamari what's pretty good. I only wish that they would put more calamari and shrimp. I think it might've been maybe two or the most three shrimp in the whole dish. The dipping sauce added some zing to the platter. For the main course we had the New York strip steak and the veal parmigiana.The New York strip steak: in general the steak was actually pretty good. The only problem was that we asked for it to be MEDIUM well, but it tasted almost burnt and dry. One of my pet peeves when it comes to high-end restaurants serving steaks is when they serve steaks with french fries. To me when they serve french fries with steaks it feels kind of lazy and cheapens the meal. I do not want ketchup near my steak, but if I have fries on my plate, I don't have much choice. Let's be honest here. If we're paying $30+ on a steak dish, we should expect more than French fries. Overall the steak meal was okay. The veal parmigiana : I found the veal to be very delicious. There were small portions where it might've been slightly overcooked, but in general I found this veal to be one of the better ones I've had. The spaghetti that came with it was perfectly boiled, firm, and not too soft. The marinara sauce was very good. Overall I enjoyed it. There tiramisu was the best I've ever had. It melts in your mouth like ice cream.The tiramisu, veal, and customer service bumped my rating to four stars instead of three stars.",1,0,0,Ben W.,"Bronx, NY",50,7,5

It's a simple and refreshing appetizer that you can't generally go wrong with.Tenderloin steak: Delicious. The seasoning and cook on the steak was spot on. The polenta was nicely cooked--lightly crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. Tasted heavily of olive oil though. Brussel sprouts were good too.S'mores bread pudding: Why do people like this? It was not good. The bread pudding was dense and difficult to cut into. Definitely a sign that it was probably made a few days in advanced and just sitting there to be scooped out onto a plate. It also needed more ice cream to go with the amount of bread pudding that was served--something cool and creamy to offset that thick mass.

5.0,1/31/2015,"Simply amazing! Makes total sense why they have been open for 23 years in the same location!Service was excellent, food was excellent- no complaints. Decor was very nice, romantic and a great date spot. We started off with the burrata, plantain chips and fig coulie. Beyond words. I could take home that fig syrup like consistently and slather it on my toast for breakfast any day! The burrata was a perfec texture. Not too soft, light, fluffy and creamy with a very faint taste. Just enough to appreciate this cheese. Mixed with the fig- it was nothing short of heaven in your mouth!We also ordered the roasted truffle butter oysters. I am not a fan of oysters what so ever but that truffle butter. Lord help me! It was sinful! The truffle butter taste is so delicious with a hint of lemon squeezed on top over mashed potatoes. Delish!The main entree was the beef short rib. One word of advice: this is to share. It's the cow plus a hoof it was so large! Soft, tender, great pull away from the bone, slow cooked, greatly seasoned to perfection, with a mashed potato that was just the right consistency and flavor of butter and garlic- light and fluffy. For dessert we ordered the s'mores bread pudding. No marshmallows to be found but it basically tasted like a very dense chocolate bread pudding with a side of graham cracker, I believe a caramel drizzle, a scoop of vanilla cream and micro chocolate crunch pellets for texture. If you got a little bit of everything, it was a party in your mouth. Just eating the bread pudding alone can be a bit overwhelming as far as chocolate taste is concerned. But together with the vanilla ice cream- it cuts the sweetness. Overall I highly recommend coming here. Very elegant and non-stuffy place.

1.0,1/21/2015,"I wouldn't recommend this place. The food was strictly ok and the service slow. We were part of the large group mentioned in another review here. The argument over the final check at the end marred what would have been a good evening with friends and family. The restaurant charged us for 22 people and an extra drink even though we were only 19. Had one of group members not caught the oversight, we wouldn't even have noticed. However, when we brought the issue up to the manager, she became aggressive.- She claimed our reservation was for 22 people and we were obligated to pay up for 22 - (None of us  have ever heard of such a policy before at any restaurant). She then insisted we had signed a contract which the group organizer clearly hadn't. I then went through the unsigned word document  which while stating the reservation was for 22 clearly mentioned the pricing was valid only if the group size was at least 18. and we had 19 so made sense we should pay for 19. and we'd have gladly paid for 18 if less than 18 would have showed up.- Before we could amicably discuss the issue and possible miscommunication, the manager  became aggressive and on occasion uttered some seemingly racist comments and even threatened to call the police ! (who does that in a service business ?!) One of the senior guys on the staff finally settled the issue but our experience with this place is tainted forever.

The chimichurri and the gorgonzola sauces weren't to my likings so I didn't use it at all. Kale and asparagus tasted as it should be-- no special sauce or flavorings which is good.

4.0,9/9/2014,"The food overall was really a 3.5 but I'm bumping it up to a four due to the really nice atmosphere and attentive waitstaff.  This is a perfect date night spot: intimate and classy.  They started off with a complementary sesame crusted slices bread basket and olive oil. For our entrées, we got the caramelized scallops and lamb with this delicious sweet corn and butter sauce.  Portions with their sides were decent-sized.  The scallops came was cauliflower florettes and a really tasty sauce.  The scallops themselves were too salty.  We ordered the rack of lamb as medium rare and it came out very tender.  The couscous was cooked with various veggies and wasn't too flavorful.  But what is worth writing home about us the sauce!  Puréed sweet corn and butter was highly addictive.We split the s'mores bread pudding for dessert which was a good choice considering it was rich (although not decadent).  It was essentially chocolate cake  topped with chocolate and marshmallow, drizzled with chocolate and mini chocolate balls and a graham cracker on the side (which provided a nice crunch to the dessert).  The final topping was a vanilla gelato although it tasted more like ice cream.Nice dinner overall with a quite lovely atmosphere.",0,0,0,Annie Y.,"San Jose, CA",40,125,303

You could tell they actually cared about connecting with their customers, especially since they shook our hands and called us by name as they engaged us in friendly conversation. The restaurant is slightly pricey, but you get what you pay for - in both service and food.Scallops are highly recommended.

1.0,8/8/2014,"I came here last night with my family for my birthday. We all did the pre-fixe restaurant week and it was awful. My boyfriend ordered ""watermelon infused gin"" on the rocks, which, according to him did not taste much like watermelon at all. So, he asked the waiter to bring him a watermelon wedge. The waiter, much to our confusion, said that they do not have watermelon. I asked him, ""so how did you 'infuse' the gin?"" and he gave me some nonsensical response about how the infusion process was done weeks ago, etc. Okay, that was quite obviously BS but, moving right along. The server mixed up at least two of our appetizer orders (we were a table of 7). I ordered the Chilean sea bass as my main entree, and I am not a chef but this restaurant served me cod. That is a completely different fish (much lower in price and quality), and I am not sure why they thought they could pass this off. My boyfriend ordered the ravioli, and to his dismay, they were completely frozen on the inside. That is pretty disgraceful, especially at an Italian restaurant. The s'mores bread pudding dessert was fine I guess. But shortly after I got home, I found myself nursing quite a stomachache. Perfect way to round out my 25th birthday... What bothers me most is, for the amount of money spent, we could have gone almost anywhere else in Manhattan and had an enjoyable meal.",0,1,0,Halley S.,"Manhattan, NY",116,58,3

Nevertheless they didn't buck an eyelid and sat us next to some pompus old men with their soho club jackets.We both ordered the duck salad, fillet mignon and chocolate bread pudding. The duck salad was evenly balanced in taste and texture. The fillet mignon was a little too chewy (my benchmark is always Peter Lugers), but had a good taste. The bread pudding was exquisite but was a little too much after eating a hearty meal.Service was excellent, décor was romantic and food was great.

3.0,7/28/2014,"Meh. Was so hoping for a great restaurant in the neighborhood, but all of the reviews are right. Here's my breakdown for the 3-stars.1 star for decor, there's a cozy romantic ambiance. Everything is red and has a 90s vibe to it. 1 star for having a nice waiter. He was very sweet and proficient, but things were MAD SLOOOOW. I think he may have been the only waiter for the entire dining room! I think we had a 30min wait between each interaction. 1 star for the great pasta - I had the penne bolognese and it was rockin----THE NEGATIVES----The bartender essentially blew us off, the bar was empty, we sat down, he asked us immediately what we wanted, I stupidly asked for a drink list and then could never get his attention again. He didn't mind chatting up the people sitting at the table near the bar or going outside for a smoke though.  We waited 15-20 minutes with no drinks.The appetizers were sub-par, we had the fried oysters and instead of being delicate fried pillows of oyster deliciousness, they were super fried puffs in what tasted like cheese whiz (not bad for TGI Fridays, but not something you expect from a fancy restaurant)The seafood - OMG, when my husband opted for their paella special, I was skeptical (as I never go crazy experimental my first time at a restaurant, I usually stick with what are safe bets, then branch out on the next visit). Well he refused to listen to me, citing the great yelp reviews on their seafood. Unfortunately this dish was inedible, he said the seafood was rubbery and everything tasted metallic.

We had the oyster appetizer once and there were two of them that tasted a little funky/not freshMaitre'd is very niceCons:It's freezing here!Some waitstaff here is terrible- Super slow and inattentive, I came here with my family and relative once, there were 6 of us, I had to wave down the waiter several times to get drinks, food ordered, ask for other things, and finally get the check, for the check, I had to wave down two people since our waiter was nowhere to be seen. I honestly did not want to give him very much tip, but we were required since we had a party of 6. - I came back another time with a friend and one of the dishes we shared was the full size pasta, when it was brought to us, I asked if it was the full size because I have ordered the half size before and it looked very similar, perhaps it was the bowl? The waitress told me it was full size and I didn't think much of it. I did like this waitress very much, she was attentive and seemed like she was new and in training. Then another waitstaff keep coming by, first he said, oh is it too small, I've never heard any other customer say it's too small, then when we got the check, he came by again to say are you hungry?

But the problem was more in the fact that we came here with a living social deal, checking the menu prior to coming in, like we always do. But the menu that was presented to us wasn't the same than the one that appears on the living social deal ( in average twice as expensive) and then when we asked the manager about it he gave us an attitude and blamed it on living social. The duck was over cooked and apparently it was due to the fact ""that the chef misread and understood medium ( it was really well done) instead of medium rear"". We ended up not eating together since I had to send the duck back and wait.

We used the bread to scoop up the truffle butter and the mashed potatoes (as suggested by our waiter) & cleared the plate, so so good!

4.0,4/2/2014,"What an interesting hot spot right on 21st street!  I was a bit shocked about how busy this place was on a Saturday night, but I guess that makes sense.  I arrived with my girlfriend and was welcomed by a very professional and courteous host.  We checked our coats and umbrellas and were seated immediately.  The waiter was very enthusiastic, knowledgeable, and attentive, with the only downside being his obnoxious ""I just smoked a cigarette outside"" smell.  As a waiter, you just can't be doing that.Let's get to the food.  DAAAAAAAAAAAANG.  This place had an unbelievable salad.  Sumptuous poached peaches, arugula, cashews, and a light parmesan-esque cheese made this mostly-carnivorous connoisseur reconsider the joys of this leafy treat.  It was delicious and for the first time in years, I fully cleaned my plate.  Next up was the dinner, chicken with mashed potatoes, done well, nothing mind blowing.  My girlfriend had penne which seemed tasty enough.  Desert was great, but not the best I've ever had, consisting of sorbet and the s'mores brownie cake.  One thing that was standout: They kept that water glass FILLED.  I must have had my glass filled nine times.  VERY IMPRESSIVE.Overall, a great meal, with a small potential improvement on the mains and dessert.  I'd recommend it for a night out on the town that will not break the bank!",0,0,0,Justin S.,"Manhattan, NY",17,58,13
4.0,3/29/2014,"Not bad. Definitely going to come back. The ambiance is very nice. I like the music they play. The restaurant is pretty intimate. It's got your usual white table cloth + low lit candle in the middle of the table. The host happened to give us the specials of the day. He was very knowledgable and made me want to eat everything. They started us off with some bread. It was seasoned with something like sesame seeds. I liked it. I wish they came warmer though. Maybe with a small plate of butter. Most restaurants don't do this, but I wish the olive oil came with a bit of vinegar. I had the burger. The bread was toasted very well. The cheese was alright. The meat was cooked medium just the way I wanted it. The onions were nice and sweet. I enjoyed them very much. The patty was pretty thick and I'm glad they cooked it so well. It came with two nice slices of bacon. Not the kind thats all fat. It came with truffle fries. They do it really well here. The fries are nice and crispy, but not so crispy that the fries are dry. The fries are pretty thin and slender. You can really smell and taste the truffle in this one. Darth Vader: THE TRUFFLE IS STRONG IN THIS ONE. I loved it.

I had the Steak and it was wonderful and tasty and just OMG good.Bets part had to be the wine person. His name escapes me as i'm atrocious with names, but he was very good. He was able to mix his knowledge of wines with some BS stories for entertainment. Asked my lady and i what we were eating, our price range, and our likes (shes a red wine gal and i'm a white wine sir). He ran away and brought us a bottle of Fiano wine that paired WONDERFULLY with the meal.i enjoyed the experience and would return another day.

1.0,3/13/2014,"Very disappointing experience here. The food was just ok, not great. We ordered the muscles with chorizo and corn as a starter and not one person found any chorizo or corn until we got to the bottom of the bowl. I had the lamb with couscous which was very pedestrian -- tasted more like an average meal you'd have served for a large group wedding or something. Fine, but not good and not very nuanced. My husband ordered the duck which was significantly better. We had a side of brussels sprouts and they were really unbalanced, way too much mustard. The wine was also disappointing. But the real kicker was the service. We were a big group and by the time everyone arrived we were about 10 minutes late -- 10 minutes! not a half hour, not even 15 minutes! -- and the maitre d' nearly had a fit. He proceeded to tell us that he was going to have to seat us before everyone was there because he was just getting totally slammed and that we'd likely have to rush through our service a bit. For being 10 MINUTES LATE! How tightly do they schedule things here??  This was for a 6:30 reservation mind you -- hardly the ideal time in NY -- and in NYC, where you're nearly never seated on time. I was shocked to be rushed like this. We all apologized, rushed to our seats and kind of rolled our eyes when he walked away -- who was this guy?? I'm sure things would get less tense... We were only 10 minutes late after all. But things only got worse! Our waiter took drink orders for half the table, then proceeded to walk away, fill those orders and only then did he come back to take the rest of ours. The service of our drinks and food was very awkward -- wavering between what I assume was their attempt to seem high class (read: stiff) and the general inexperience of our waiters (read: mixing up plates, awkwardly holding up service because the maitre d' needed to get by with another table's drinks). It was very odd for a place that bills itself as high class. Then to cap things off, the maitre d' came back towards the end of the meal with the check and another reminder that he needed to rush us out and get another group in, he was ""getting totally slammed"" and ""just needed us to wrap things up."" It was exceedingly rude. We were there to celebrate a good friend's birthday and here we were made to feel like we were just taking up space that more important people were to fill. I'm not sure who trained this maitre d' but his whole attitude was not only insulting, it was embarrassing (for him). I've never experienced someone like this at an upscale restaurant and I will definitely never go back. Such a disappointment.",0,0,0,Emily T.,"Manhattan, NY",0,6,0
3.0,3/10/2014,"I purchased a Living Social deal, spend $30, get $60 off the bill for Giorgio's and figured I would give it a try one Saturday evening. I made an 8pm reservation and showed up early to wait for a gf of mine. The service at the bar was terrible. I was by myself and the bartender didn't acknowledge me for 15 minutes or so. At 8pm, I went over to the maitre d' and told him that we were both present. He said that the table was still paying their check. We ended up waiting until 8:50 to be seated. The maitre d' then told us he would make sure we were taken care of. We ordered a bottle of French white wine, it was tasty, then a small app that came out right away. I ordered the scallops for dinner, they were delicious. When we went to get the . check though, the server was totally m.i.a., which really irked me. The restaurant however is really cute and the food was really tasty. Moving on...right before we went to leave we were given a free glass of wine to taste, which I was pleased about, but didn't think it made up for the hour wait we had. When we left however, the maitre'd pulled me aside and profusely apologized for the long delay and handed me a $60 gift certificate.

4.0,2/19/2014,"In hindsight, I have to give credit to Giorgio's for breaking my long-held aversion to Italian cuisine. Situated in the Union Square/Flatiron neighborhood, it may be difficult to fathom the value of this restaurant, especially in comparison to its neighboring peers. Even upon entering, my initial impressions of Giorgio's were less than favorable: there was no visible host to greet us by the door, and after a few moments of confusion, we made our way down the bar to the actual dining area. The host seemed slightly too carefree and seated us with what seemed to be a last minute thought. Needless to say, I wasn't expecting much at all.The experience became exponentially better afterwards, however. Our server throughout the evening was efficient, warm, and attentive and took all of our requests with ease. As we skimmed the menu, we agreed that the sides seemed more attractive than the actual appetizers, and decided to begin the meal with two of them instead. I was debating between an entree or a pasta as my main, but after glancing at the selection the diners next to us had made, I immediately changed my mind and opted for the burger.Regarding the sides - first, the Sweet Potato Pork Belly Hash sounds considerably better than it actually is. While perhaps tasty in theory, the execution of this side didn't carry all the way through; the sweet potato wasn't fully cooked and was difficult to chew. The pork belly, while delightfully fatty, didn't seem to belong in the dish either. Our Wild Mushroom-Gruyere-Potato Gratin was thankfully much better. The potato had been sliced to a good thickness and, when paired with cheese and slices of mushroom, made for a rich bite.It was quite filling for its size, which more than made up for the pork belly hash.And while I understand that Giorgio's specializes in Italian cuisine, I couldn't refrain from ordering Giorgio's burger: a substantial portion of truffle oil fries, flecked with parmesan and garlic, next to a heaping burger topped with braised onions and gruyere cheese. The fries had been perfectly crisped and were more than enough for the two of us to share. I had to save the best for last, however: this burger was phenomenal. Cooked to a perfect medium, seasoned well, and wonderfully juicy, each bite with the braised onion and melted cheese was delicious. Albeit quite a feat to eat, I would hazard to say that this is one of the best burgers I've yet to try. A surprisingly enjoyable and reasonably-priced dinner, a pleasant ambiance,  food that is both delicious and filling? It's a combination that can't go wrong, and yes, I will be returning just for that burger.",4,3,3,Lori L.,"New York, NY",2244,608,6827

We ordered the roasted oysters with shallots as an appetizer. They were delicious and I used the juices to dip the bread in. Didn't understand the mashed potatoes in the center of the plate though. As an entree I got the Caramalized scallops with cauliflower purée,raisins and almonds and a pomegranate reduction. Man was that delicious!. The scallops where perfectly cooked and the purée with raisins was a good contrast of flavors. My date got the Veal chop don't remember what it came with but I did try a piece and that was also dynamite and I don't eat veal. Not dry and very flavorful. Scalloped potatoes on the side were good not great. By the time we were done we had no room for dessert next time I will try it for sure. Nice decor and fun loud atmosphere. Great staff and service.

If you don't get this, something is seriously wrong with you. This is probably going to be the only reason I come back to Giorgio's, and believe me,  it's a worthy reason. The linguine with shrimp and lobster was good - good sauce in particular. But overall dish is hard to mess up with those ingredients. Burger was alright - too charred for my taste but the truffle fries were fantastic. (maybe I'm just in love with truffle, but who isn't?)cocktail that my sister ordered was tiny and too sweet. My beer, schneider weisse aventinus, on the other hand, was phenomenal. do yourself a favor: come here, get the roasted oysters with the beer for a quick delicious treat before moving on to your next place of the night.",0,1,0,Sung K.,"New York, NY",251,569,0
4.0,12/7/2013,"It's a rainny Friday afternoon, I came for lunch with my 3 colleagues.  When I first walked in, my impression was .. wow .. it's kinda smelly in here like a seafood market place.  It's a narrow and small place so the smell just made the room feels stuffy to me, but my friend thought it was cozy.All of us ordered lunch prix fixe which was $30 for 3 courses .. decent price I thought.  On the menu, it will show as $45, but it's wrong. I chose fried oysters, sea scallops, and s'more bread pudding.  Fried oysters were crispy and had a tiny spicy kick to them.  I wish there were more on the plate!!!  I scooped every drop of cream spinach from oyster shells .. so good!  My entree was great, there was sand here and there from a few bites of scallops.  That's only my complaint.  I loved enoki mushrooms that offered crunchy texture to balance out the buttery soft scollops.  I tried a bite of Filet Magnon that my friend ordered, I thought it was okay.  Perhaps the bite that I took lacked of good seasoning, but all of my friends enjoyed it.I really don't care much for chocolate especially when it comes to dessert, but I ordered s'more with chocolate bread pudding anyway.  2 of my friends ordered gelato so I thought I'd try something different.  It was actually quite good.  The pudding was warm and not too sweet..bonus for me because I don't like anything too sweet. I didn't finish the whole thing, only ate gelato and half of the pudding part and I left everything else for my fried to finish it.Overall, I enjoyed the food.  Ambiance was so so to me, maybe dinner hours would feel more cozy.  The smell bothered me the whole lunch hour which was a big bummer.  I would rate this 3.5 stars because of that.  Service was good, took a little long for desserts to come out though.",2,0,0,Kim S.,"Stamford, CT",206,235,454

Recently had the duck breast and the prosciutto mac' and cheese, as well as an old fashioned. The prosciutto mac was a fantastic appetizer (probably a little too filling) and the duck was cooked perfectly, with fantastic spaghetti squash and spinach. Another favorite of mine is the squid ink linguine, as well as the fritto misto appetizer.This sounds like an unusual thing to note, but their bread and olive oil at the beginning of the meal are always fantastic and warm - its always gone before the main courses came.In sum, Giorgio's is an excellent place to go if you'd like to have good, audible conversations with your dinner partners over excellent food with a contemporary modern atmosphere.",0,0,0,Austin O.,"Astoria, Queens, NY",258,147,205
4.0,11/25/2013,"Was here on a Saturday night. I made a reservation, but I was 30 minutes late. They of course gave my table to somebody else, but they seated us 5 minutes after, so I felt pretty lucky.Service was excellent, waiter noticed even the little thing on your table, that tells you how good their services are. We ordered Blue Mussels with Vodka sauce, Grilled New York Strips with Garlic Butter and Fries, and Squid Ink Linguine. DEFINITELY ORDER THE MUSSELS. They came in a big plate, and piece of bread (which is a bit over-burnt, but it's ok, bread is not the focus here) and the sauce just goes so well with the mussels. Seriously, we just kept jumping from one mussel to another, and it's so good that we won't even stop. The grilled new york strips is nothing special, they are not bad, but they are not some exquisite dish that you gotta have. The Squid Ink Linguine is what I was looking forward to. I was a little disappointed, the octopus in the Linguine was cooked very well, not chewy at all; however, the sauce for this pasta was a bit too spicy for you to taste how the squid ink linguine really is. I think the sauce did override the linguine itself. That's the reason I took away a star, I think they can do better for the dishes. Taking everything into account, I will still recommend this restaurant, because overall the experience is very good.  Tables are small, not suitable for a big group.",1,0,0,Ivy T.,"Fresh Meadows, NY",92,105,124
2.0,11/21/2013,"The improved ambiance is welcome. I got the rear section along the wall, pretty private until around 7:30 PM. Chairs are definitely new and improved. However, a waiter can make or break the dining experience. What a pleasure to watch the superb one four tables over who said that he'd been there 8 years give his opinions. It was like watching Food Network. Mine spoke English as a second language. As I had dessert, the man next to me listening to specials remarked to his date, ""I have no idea what he just said"" after he walked off. I know the feeling.Giorgio's still offers an amuse bouche, soppressata with goat cheese. I could have eaten a quarter pound worth. The table adjacent to the kitchen asked for butter, declining olive oil for their bread, and I followed suit. Their bread is still lousy, lightweight and tasteless. The linguini was terrific. It's nice having fresh lobster and shrimp in a pasta dish. Plenty of sauce is provided. Then came the grilled NY strip, substituting asparagus for the fries. Two slabs of herbed butter sat on the steak like glaciers. I complained to the waiter, who said it was on the menu. Okay, but I hardly imagined there would be so much of the stuff. BTW, reading a menu in that light is very challenging, even with smartphone light. The steak was perfectly salted without reaching for the sea salt thimble. I continue to be frustrated by dried meat ordered medium well. Medium or bust from now on. He asked how it was twice, but of course not until the very last bit did I find a hard strip of fat.Regrettably, I flushed $10 on baked alaska. The presentation is spectacular, but its blah taste is poor. The singed cream on top leaves an ash aftertaste. The ice cream is good but the foundation cake is dry as dust.

I thought the veggies were strange and I had a horrible stomach ache. But I also have a sensitive stomach (which is why I'm a picky eater) so I didn't hold that against them either. The place was nice so I figured next time I'm here I'll try something different.  But the poor service we received left a bad taste in my mouth so this was most likely my last time there. When we were seated the waiter told us the specials. We both heard him say ""$20"" for the bass. My friend decided to get it instead of the duck which was $26 so she could save money.  She loved the bass and I agree that it was delicious.   We get our bill and I'm confused. I show her the price of her food and we both agreed that we heard him say the special was $20.I decide to ask the waiter.  I asked him if he wrote the price down wrong. He said no. I told him we both heard him say it was $20. His response is what made me not want to come back. ""impossible.""  No sympathy, nothing. I told him okay and he left.  The manager came over and apologized about it which I appreciated since the waiter was totally rude.  The manager was nice enough to adjust the price for us.

Upon entering the restaurant, I was given the option to be seated near the door or in the back of the restaurant. The restaurant is very narrow and quite small but the atmosphere is quite romantic, dimly lit with a candle on each table. However, it might not be such a good idea for first dates unless you like to scream while trying to have a conversation since it gets really loud. I started off with steam mussels and it's extremely flavorful except for the occasional sand in the mussels. I had the seared salmon with potato while my companion had the seared pork chops with pork belly hash. My salmon was cook medium well, just the way I like it and it was pretty good. However, what shocked me the most was the seared pork chops. When I saw the size of the pork chop and how thick the meat is, I was sure it would be chewy and dry. Boy was I wrong! The pork chop was so juicy and tender, yet flavorful. The pork belly hash it came with was also delicious. I like the order so much I decided to switch half of my order with my companion's. We paired the dish with a glass of prosecco and that was delicious as well.

5.0,10/17/2013,"So its now been 3 years since I first started going to Giorgio's and I've only grown more pleased with my experiences there.  I like to go every couple of months, and it was actually the first place I thought of to have a first date with my now husband.  Last night I took him there for his birthday dinner.  As we usually do we arrived an hour early to start with drinks at the bar for their happy hour specials.  Once we were full of yummy wine and beer we headed in for dinner.  I had the fritto misto to start which was a really big portion, much more than I was anticipating, but luckily I ordered the scallops for dinner and that was nice and light and perfectly cooked.  My husband had the spring rolls and the rack of lamb.  Everything was delicious as always (although I'll have to take hubbys word on the spring rolls since I didn't get a bite!).  And we shared the creme brulee for dessert.  So I've eaten a lot of different items off their menu, but I have a slight obsession with their buffalo mozzarella appetizer and their risotto.  It varies by season as the rest of their menu does and I try very hard not to get it every time I go but now that I didn't have it last night I have an intense feeling of having missed something!  LOL guess I have to go back again soon!And I just want to note that I've frequently gone there with either a groupon or a restaurant.com voucher and have never, ever been treated like I was anything other than a valued customer.  So many times you see a deal for a restaurant and you read the reviews and hear about how crappy the service was when they found out how you were paying but the people at Giorgio's treat you like gold no matter who you are or how you're paying.  There is always a warm and welcoming feeling from their employees, it makes me look forward to my next visit.",4,0,0,Devon M.,"Jersey City, NJ",3,15,4

It had some fish and calamaris in it as well. The highlight of the dish was their spicy broth and I was pretty much slurping up every bit of it. Thank goodness for the extra bread on the side.-My Seared Duck Breast was very good as well, but it was pretty tough cutting it into pieces. I felt like I was hacking into it and the table was definitely moving. Woops! The side salad that came with it was very flavorful and I liked how they incorporated some fruits with it (which gave it a very nice touch). -We also ordered the Herb Chicken, which I felt tasted more like a typical rotisserie chicken (but with more sauce on it).

We also shared the antipasto: olives, green beans, peppers, with salami, prosciutto and some type of semi hard cheese. The bread was not served with butter. Ok, you want to pretend to be Italian and enforce a dipping policy. Well at least have some decent olive oil then.The antipasto tasted like it was bought at a discount grocery store. I've had Tesco salami better than that.The pan seared halibut was dry (breaded!! - why? is this McD's?) and lacked seasoning. The clam broth lacked any flavor and I found the combination of fish in a broth of couscous bizarre after trying it (I was optimistic when I first ordered.) I tried the pork belly side from my friend's pork chop dish. It was almost vomit inducing. A strong after taste and again no seasoning.The pork chop was dry too. Whoever cooks the food there must not possess taste buds.The service was not attentive, it was paranoid. Several staff asked how the beer tasted (it's an Amstel light, how is it supposed to taste?), how the antipasto was, how the entrees were. Listen - once at the end of dinner is enough.

5.0,8/25/2013,"OMG restaurant week extended.Office mates and i decided for italian and we were not disappointed. The place was empty for lunch so we were a bit skeptical but still decided to go in. We were seated all the way to the back and instantly the swarm of servers came to help. We ordered some items from rest week and the regular menu and they were all super delicious.For the table we ordered the calamari, nothing special right.. wrong.. it was crispy and non greasy. we all enjoyed them and will sure order them again.I had the watermelon shrimp salad and  i was not disappointed, the shrimp was cooked on a grill and the watermelon didn't feel like it had been on a fridge. Then i ordered the filet mignon medium and it came back looking like a piece of art. took a few pictures and started to devour the food. Size is good, i didnt feel hungry after eating my meals. it came with string bean veggies (i dont really like) but they were cooked perfectly on the grill and i ate them all.

3.0,8/12/2013,"3.5. Group of five for restaurant week. Made 8pm reservations for a Sunday nightAtmosphere: Dim and narrow. It's really intimate, and tables are rather close together. It can get loud inside. We arrived about ten minutes early and our table wasnt ready. Then at 8 it still wasnt ready, and we waited about another 10 minutes before we were seated. MehFood: We all opted for price fixed menu.Appetizer: Seared Tuna. One out of the three pieces was a little too cooked, but the other two were delicious and prepared well. Main: Veal - holy balls they don't joke around with the portion size. My veal was HUGE. The meat was tender and flavored well, and the spinach and cheese, although a little hard to cut and chew, added a complementing taste. Mine had a little too much fat on it though, so it became a little overwhelming and I had to let my friends finish it off, haha.Dessert: S'more bread pudding. Delicious, but VERRRYYYY sweet. The marshmallow was so good, and the consistency was more brownie/cake like rather than bread pudding like. Service: Our waiter took a while before he introduced himself to us, but he was friendly and helpful.",1,0,0,Tiffany O.,"Newark, NJ",314,516,1390

The gentleman who was the host for the evening didn't really speak to us much. He just sat us an walked away. The restaurant was very dark, very intimate, but almost too dark. We got the baked lobster Mac & cheese to share and it was very good. Myself & my date also got the gourmet burger & truffle fries. Both were good but the burger had a strong smokey flavor to it. By the time I got to the 2nd half, I was tired of it. Our server was very quick & attentive. The tables are very close together. I felt like I could eat the food off of the couple next to me's plates. For dessert, my girlfriend and I shared the S'more bread pudding and it was pretty amazing.

5.0,8/10/2013,"When I think of Gramercy, two restaurants stand out in my mind: Gramercy Tavern and Giorgio's of Gramercy. Gramercy Tavern is arguably one of the best restaurants I have ever been to but while that meal filled my happy stomach, it left a large gaping hole in my wallet. Thankfully, a short walk from this legendary restaurant is an unpretentiously romantic and cozy little restaurant, Giorgio's of Gramercy, that offers delicious Italian food and impeccable service. Best of all, it didn't cost me an arm and a leg.This is the fourth time I have been to Giorgio's but my last visit is still fresh in my mind. I came here with my boyfriend on a Wednesday night. We had a reservation and were seated immediately. James was our server and he is the sweetest, most attentive, and most down-to-earth server I have ever had. You can tell that the guy genuinely enjoys making his customers happy. This is the second time we have had him as our server and we will now always ask for him by name. Our glasses were never empty and he was always checking in on us. He gave us excellent recommendations from the menu. He even gave us two complimentary glasses of a dry rose wine that paired perfectly with our meal. I have not been to a place whose service could make you feel warm and fuzzy all over but Giorgio's of Gramercy did it for me. I was in love....Similar to the service, the food was nothing short of amazing. They have yet to disappoint us with a bad preparation of their steamed mussels. This time, they were served with a chorizo adobo sauce with guajillo and ancho chilis. It was savory, slightly sweet, with a hint of heat. The crusty bread (although a little too charred for my liking) was perfect for sopping up the delicious sauce. As usual, I wanted to lick the plate clean but the attentive busboy removed the plate before I could embarrass myself. How thoughtful of him! For our entrees, we shared the catch of the day and two small portions of pasta. We had the grilled butterflied trout with jalapeño coulis served with roasted Peruvian potatoes and chanterelle mushrooms. Fish was grilled to perfection with a nice mild charred flavor that complemented the slight heat of the coulis. The penne with veal bolognese was creamy, rich, and meaty just like it should be. The squid ink linguine with octopus in arrabiata was fresh and had a nice heat from the red pepper flakes. The octopus was perfectly tender and the pasta was al dente. My only complaint is that the linguine was stuck together so we had to pull the strands apart, a minor setback to an excellent meal. Of course we polished off our entrees and unfortunately, left no room for dessert. However, I would recommend the s'mores bread pudding. We had it the last time we were here and it was scrumptious. Soft and gooey on the inside and slightly chewy in the outside. We told James that we would've been able to finish the last of it with another scoop of ice cream, James said ""Be careful what you wish for..."" and without hesitation, brought us a hefty scoop of vanilla ice cream. it was the perfect ending to a perfect meal. Needless to say, we licked the plate clean that night.In summary, this restaurant gets 5 stars for service and 4.5 stars for food. I highly recommend this gem of a restaurant for date nights or small parties. You will not be disappointed!",3,0,1,Janet C.,"Forest Hills, Queens, NY",0,4,0
5.0,8/5/2013,"Initially my bf and I walked into a white tablecloth setting, with awkward seating and table.chair placement, we walked away with a bag of clams, and a smile on each of our faces. Though we  were a tad turned off initially, after the reconnaissance of the decor it made sense. The service is very spot on, friendly, and although a white tablecloth suggests a certain attitude and treatment, this spot dolled up none of the negative, but all the positive. Service was simply 5 stars. My bf and I ordered of the a la carte and prix fix menu. As appetizers, we had the mac and cheese (a la carte), which came with leeks, garlic, and broccoli. Though I tasted no leek, or garlic, the smokey mac and cheese got better with each bite, the additions of broccoli were nice. The seared tuna (prix fix menu) was disappointing. Fishy, and over soggy spinach. It would have benefited from some flavour and a few more minutes over a flame. Now for the main course entrees, I had the bronzino, which was crisped, at the bottom, and perfect everywhere else, along side some lobster mashed potatoes, and baby asparagus paired with a robust red pepper sauce streak. Holy perfection. My bf had the striped bass special.Though the tarragon in the dish was a tad powerful for me, he loved it. The barley, red pepper, mushroom salad in a ginger coconut broth were to die for, but the clams that came with the dish were not touched. We didn't know the dish had clams, but those were taken to go (for my dad).For dessert we had a gelato trio. The banana was out of this world, it straight up reminded me of New Orleans banana fosters beignets. The hazelnut had nice surprises of chocolate crunch hidden within the ice cream; this was one of my favourites ever! The cinnamon went well with all 3, but was slightly unremarkable on its own. However, with some red pepper flakes, WOW!Would go here again, no doubt.P.SThe cocktail list here is worth a try too!",1,0,0,Queen R.,"Brooklyn, NY",160,603,20

Every bite was SO delicious! I got the restaurant week menu and had the tuna, branzino and s'mores dessert. The tuna was two small slices. I was surprised to see them serve this as an appetizer- it was so small! I bet if it wasn't a restaurant week item, they wouldn't have served such a small portion. The fish was nice and crispy and the side of lobster mashed potatoes was genius and amazing. My boyfriend started with the mussels that were on special that came with a vodka sauce and chorizo. Wow, this was really great! Loved taking the bread and soaking it in the sauce. He also enjoyed his rack of lamb. I used the scoutmob app and got $25 off the check.

We ordered 1 restaurant week pre-fixe, 2 courses for me and my friend. My chickpea salad with scallops was awesome, good size and quality of scallops too! My friends loved their salad too. Our main course tool so long time to come out, the restaurant was nice enough to offer complimentary glasses of prosecco that we are having. My dish was black ink linguini pasta, it was amazing.

4.0,7/14/2013,"I really enjoyed my meal here. The staff was incredibly attentive, from the host (maybe the manager) to our waiter. He even gave us a variety of choices for where to sit, and told us where the AC was since it was such a hot day. We came with a $30 for $60 worth of food, which didn't alter our experience at all. The spring roll appetizer was light and delicious, the sauce was the best part. For drinks I had the blueberry lemonade. I felt it was too sweet with not enough alcohol, but the waiter admitted that it was new to the menu. I wanted the lychee drink, but wanted to know if it was fresh lychee. He didn't know, but was nice enough to go ask that bartender (it was just purée of lychee). My bf had the sour cherry, which definitely had enough alcohol! I had the grilled citrus and herb chicken. Amazing flavors, tender and moist chicken, and yummy mashed potatoes. My bf had the seared ahi tuna special. He really enjoyed it.Since so many people raved about the s'mores bread pudding, I had to get it. It was incredibly rich and delicious. Definitely one to share. My bf had the blood orange cheesecake. The texture was more like a sponge cake, but the flavors were really good. Since we had appetizers, drinks, and dessert, we payed well over what our groupon offered. It was worth it.

Then topped with bread crumbs for a crush?? Yum! I ordered the duck. It's a decent portion for what I paid.The duck was cook right but was a tad chewy than I liked. The skin was crispy yet had a nice layer of fat underneath... It was cooked pretty well but I felt like there was a knack missing.The truffle fries were crisped well & sprinkled with cheese. Anything with truffle is amazing so I'll give this one a thumbs up.Service was a tad slow though. That's probably my main complaint at the moment.The setting is pretty intimate.

It's not too big and does get packed pretty quickly for dinner so I would definitely make a reservation.  I came here with my wife and we had a $25 certificate from restaurant.com. Great way to save some bucks.For the food, we got:1. Mac and Cheese w/ lobster: We wanted the half order but they made a mistake and gave us a full order. It was pretty good but not amazing. I've been having some pretty awesome mac and cheese dishes lately and I've seen many restaurants get pretty fancy with the pasta and the cheese. Theirs is more traditional but they do add big pieces of broccoli. The lobster was a bit dry. 3.5/52. Burger: We wanted medium rare but we got medium well with some serious over charring on the bottom. We pointed this to our waiter who immediately took it back and told us they would fix it. He seemed more upset than us (more about him later). When he got back to us with a replacement, the burger was cooked perfectly. We liked the peppery flavor of the meat though it was slightly dry. Overall it's a good burger but can't really compete with the burgers where the meat has been dry aged and has more depth in flavor. The truffle fries were excellent. 3.75/53. Moroccan Spiced Rack of Lamb: 5 pieces of ribs perfectly cooked medium rare. They were seasoned very well albeit slightly on the dry side again. I didn't care much for the vegetable ratatouille as it didn't have much texture but did find the zucchini mouse interesting. 3.75/5Afterwards, our waiter came by again to talk about the burger that the kitchen had messed up. While doing so, he took out a bottle of French dessert wine and poured us two glasses. A 2010 bottle of Jurancon - deliciously sweet and perfect for two over stuffed, food baby mom and pop like us. Apparently he had been saving it. He even gave us his business card. It said  ""James J Shay III, Wine Director"".  Great guy.While the food at Georgio's was slightly below 4 stars, the service definitely pushed it up there. Everyone - from the  host, the waiter and the runners  were extremely professional. With our cert, we paid $50 all-in for a lot of food.

For entrees, I ordered the scallops which were perfectly cooked, and the portions were HUGE! Typically, you get 3-4 scallops at other restaurants, and by the end of dinner you're still starving.

Although the macaroni was cooked perfectly, the Mac and Cheese did not have enough cheese and only had a creamy texture without much flavor.  The Veal Chop was ginormous even for $31 and filled the entire extra long plate; however, it lacked flavor and needed at least some sauce or a marinade flavor to bring it together.  As a side note, it would have been nice if the dish was correctly portioned and priced.",0,0,0,Jimmy C.,"Manhattan, NY",0,87,23

What we ordered:- Soup of the day: Cauliflower soup- Penne bolognese- Sweet potato - pork belly hash- Tuna with forbidden rice and mint sauceAmbience was great, a bit too dark for me to take pictures but good enough for me to see what I am eating. Service was excellent. I love the waiter that waited on our table. We typically don't order a dish of appetizer and main each because we can't finish and so we will share. Most waiters would give us the ""what-the?!?!"" look or repeatedly ask us whether we're sure we don't want this other appetizer or this other dish. NO, we don't want. We can't finish, the portions are too huge for us so stop asking. This waiter was always polite, always eager to help us, whether we want something or not, he's cool with it. I'd give him 10 stars! Unfortunately, i forgot to get his name :(Food wise:-Cauliflower soup. Hardly any cauliflower taste, not that cauliflower has much taste. Tasted the celery for most of it. The soup was thick and creamy and absolutely tasty. Whatever little bits of scallops in there were soft and blends in very well with the creamy texture. The portion of this soup is quite big (for an Asian girl) so do take note.Bread. Toasted sesame bread. Not fantastic but the toasted sesame smell/taste was rather strong. Penne Bolognese. the pasta was cooked al dente. the bolognese sauce was strong and yet not overpowering. Dainty on the pasta you could still savor the texture of the penne. FYI, they don't give much sauce/meat. But the dish was still awesome!Sweet potato-pork belly hash - The pork was great. Especially the fatty parts. Absolutely delicious! Very sinful for sure but it was soft and yummy. Very oily dish. Tuna. We asked for medium rare tuna. The meat didn't have much taste so that was disappointing. But the accompanying sides made up for it! Forbidden rice with cranberries, pine nuts and a slap of mint sauce. I thought the mint sauce was a little too sweet, but other than that, everything blended in really well to create a mouthful of texture and flavors - sweet, teeny bit sour from the berries, savory and crunchy.

First, it is red, classic and sexy. It is perfect for a date or romantic evening. But the thing that most impressed me was how many people were sitting alone at the bar, and how comfortable it was to sit there for a meal. There was a neighborhood feel to the place -- it seemed that everyone at the bar knew the bartender and the host by name and were regulars. Ryan, the bartender, was really personable, attentive and a really cool guy.Then the food -- wow. First, it is reasonable. My very generous antipasto plate of meats and cheeses was $12. My seared tuna entree was $22, and it was more than plentiful. Secondly, the food is in the New American / farm to table style and ranges from chicken, to steak, to pasta. I chose the seared tuna on a bed of sticky brown rice, cranberries and mint creme freche. I'm still thinking about it. The sauce was the perfect compliment to the tuna.There were many other things on the menu to try, and I will be back.

The interior strikes me as a bit oddly designed. The place is quite narrow already, but the placement of tables makes the place seem even more cramped. The lighting screams 'date night', but somehow when everything is put together it feels slightly tacky. We had the calamari for the appetizer. The restaurant is Italian (I think), but this dish seemed like Japanese tempura. Not that it did not taste good - but definitely seemed a bit out of place. I had the salmon, and I thought the fish was well cooked. Definitely a solid dish; very hearty. My friend had the squid-ink pasta, and it was too spicy for my liking.

It wasn't bad, but it wasn't great either (and considering the prices, I'd expect something great).I ordered the duck and although the duck was cooked well (very tender, and juicy duck), the sauce was kind of odd and I didn't feel it fit with the meat very well. I couldn't quite pin point what the sauce was but it was tasted kind of like a tangy, nutty, yet somehow really sweet hoisin sauce.  My date ordered the Tuna and that was alright as well.

3.0,2/19/2013,"My boyfriend and I went to Giorgio's for a belated Valentine's dinner. The restaurant itself is cozy and looks nice on the inside. At times it got a bit loud even to hear each other across the table, but perhaps it was an exceptionally busy night for them (the Saturday after Valentine's Day). The service was wonderful.I ordered the ny steak with lemon french fries and he ordered the rack of lamb. My steak was good and I absolutely LOVED the french fries. My boyfriend wasn't a fan of his lamb. Considering we read that it was supposed to be one of their specials, it was definitely a let down.Then we came to dessert...all I have to say is...just skip it... because it will leave you feeling very disappointed that you spent $10 per dish. My boyfriend ordered the s'more bread pudding. It wasn't at all like what we were expecting. It was extremely chocolatey...more like a chocolate cake/mouse than a bread pudding. The ice cream that came with it was good. I guess they added the half of a graham cracker on the side of the plate so they could call it a ""s'more"". My dessert was far worse. I ordered the baked alaska. It didn't look or taste anything like normal baked alaska. Here's what it was: a very dry/semi frozen piece of chocolate cake about a 1/2 inch thick. Then they put strawberry sorbet on top of that and covered it in meringue...possibly to hide just how bad the sorbet was. It wasn't smooth at all. In fact, it tasted like ice. The meringue on top was delicious and the only edible thing on the plate.

The decor is in need of a Robert Irvine-esque upgrade. Dark red walls and oversized chandeliers made it feel as if we'd stepped into a 60s era fine dining restaurant. Our waiter (and apparent manager and wine sommelier) was very friendly with helpful recommendations. We started with raw oysters. They were ok but seemed a little stale. We then had the braised short ribs over risotto and the chickpea salad with grilled scallops. We both really enjoyed our entrees despite the fact that they went a little light on the short ribs. We finished with the s'more dessert, which was delectable. Overall the food was very good but not great. The wine selection seemed pretty good and the waiter was very knowledgeable about the list.

For the first course, I had the arugula salad with fried goat cheese with the perfect vinaigrette-olive oil dressing, paired with a glass of Bordeaux blanc.  A few others had the fried oysters, which was also good, although I would have preferred a raw bar of oysters instead. For second course, I had the branzino paired with a buttery Calera Chardonnay.  I'm not normally a Chardonnay fan, but this paired so well with the branzino.  Others had the veal chop paired with a glass of Taron reserva Rioja.  This reminds me of how much I miss and love Spain!  Dessert was good too, and I'm surprised I was able to still eat after all the big portions.  But, who could say no to smores inspired dessert?! It was a great finish to the meal, along with the paired Ruby port.  And for those who wanted something on the lighter side, they also served a sorbet/gelato trio with a glass of Madeira.I definitely recommend this place, and I wish I had known about it sooner!",0,0,0,Caroline C.,"Brooklyn, NY",381,311,298

We did not expect the service to be prompt nor perfect since it was Restaurant Week; however, they surely served us like regulars and made us want to come back again!

4.0,1/22/2013,"My friends and I ate here for RW Winter 2013 for a good, reasonably priced meal before heading off to an exciting concert in W. Midtown!When we entered, I thought, ""It's a cute place but they need to lay off the curtains."" You'll see what I'm saying when you get here! Aside from the drapery OD, I would give my meal a solid four stars.All of us were starving so we nom'ed on the moist, chewy bread and began drizzling it with their possibly crack-infused olive oil. We finished off two bowls of bread and drained the bottle half way before our apps arrived (that's how hungry we were!)As my app, I ordered their deliciously crisp Fried Oysters with creamed spinach and a spicy remoulade. These were divine! I could've ate a bowl of these! It also came with some microgreens on the side that I didn't care for. I ate my greens anyways, drizzling them generously with the olive oil. My entree was the Big Eye Tuna with farro, pomegranate seeds, almonds, and swiss chard but I asked our waiter to switch the chard for something else. He suggested spinach and it worked perfectly in my meal. The oysters were a solid five but my tuna  dish would be a three. I mean, the tuna was cooked the way I wanted (medium rare), farro was plump and soft, marrying well with the crunch of pomegranate seeds and almonds; however, I felt that my fish was overly seasoned with pepper atop the bed of bland, simply boiled spinach. Ugh, I was craving for the creamed spinach like the one in the oysters! The flavors of this dish melded perfectly though with the balsamic dressing but I wish there was more of it. It was a pretty big portion of food though. My friends ordered the Filet Mignon with garlic mashed potatoes, fall vegetables, and a port wine reduction. They said that their steak was cooked correctly and that the mashed potatoes were a hit! I tried some of the potatoes...they were totally on point!! Creamy and  buttery with chunks of potatoes still in there. Mmm...how delectable. Finally, for dessert, we ordered the signature S'mores Bread Pudding and a trio of gelato (rum raisin, dulce de amor, and strawberry). I've had my share of bread pudding and this dessert wasn't the best in my opinion. My chocolate lover friend was swimming with glee but I disliked the chocolate bits embedded on the pudding and the cocoa nibs.  What I liked was the bread pudding quality, the burnt marshmallow top, and the caramel drizzle. My other friend loved her strawberry gelato but wasn't a fan of the two scoops of dulce de amor she put on top (she omitted the rum raisin..no!!) The dulce de amor tastes like amaretto ice cream. It was pretty good actually! Oh, and the vanilla bean gelato over my bread pudding sort just tasted like regular ice cream.

4.0,1/21/2013,"Came here for dinner on Friday night to get in on the NYC Restaurant Week action with a couple good friends.I started off with the arugula salad, which was good sized and drizzled with a tasty raspberry vinegarette and served with fried balls of goat cheese.  Yum!  Just wished there were more candied pecans.  My friends both got the soup du jour (some sort of tomato bisque) which was delicious and reminded me of sauce my mom used to make.For the main course I got the veal chop (medium) which was so tender and flavorful that I wanted to gnaw on the bone.  Sometimes social etiquette just plain sucks.Desserts were also good (smore's, & sorbet).  Tried one cocktail (Giorgio's manhattan) and felt it was pretty weak.Overall, good food and worth checking out, especially with the R.W. deals.",0,0,0,Todd A.,"Manhattan, NY",36,129,0

4.0,1/17/2013,"It is NYC Restaurant Week 2013 - So I am taking full advantage! I really liked Giorgio's WR dinner menu so I went with my cousin. I arrived early nearly 1 hour and the host quickly arranged a spot for me at the bar.  The service is already a show a leading role. They have a happy hour and it is from 4- 7 PM. Giorgio's offers many different kinds of infused cocktails. I had a spicy margarita. It's very tasty. Spicy but not over the top spicy; and get this for $7.00, a great find in NYC. The restaurant is quaint. We were seated towards the rear of the dining room which was nice. They have a semi-open kitchen layout, which I always like. We both ordered off of the WR menu. I had the crispy oysters with creamed spinach and a chipotle remoulade. DELISH! My cousin chooses the arugula salad with goat cheese croquettes. Not over dressed and very flavorful. Entree's, I had the Branzino with roasted fennel, artichokes, eggplant and olives. It was cooked to perfection and very, very tasty. My dining companion selected the veal chop, also amazing. It came with a potato gratin that was full of calories, opps I mean flavor. Another hit! We were so full from the generous portions of our meals that we could barely touch our desserts. S'mores and the trio of sorbet. Very good though.The service was wonderful through the whole meal until the end when we were full and getting restless to have our check, this took a while to receive. My only gripe was how warm it was in the restaurant. Other Yelpers reviews noted it was cold; well it certainly wasn't the night I ate here.

Would recommend not going with a group bigger than 4 because the seating just isn't made that way.I've had the cheese/meat/olive plate as an appetizer, which I thought was alright. No soft cheeses on the plate when I was there. I've also had the linguine with lobster and shrimp, which was a steal at $20! I was pleasantly surprised with the amount of lobster and shrimp that was on my plate. I would, however, pass at the sweet potato gnocchi with the duck confit. The duck was delicious but the gnocchi was too doughy for my liking. The grilled salmon was solid- crispy outside, smooth inside. The winner though, is the pork chop. WOW.

4.0,11/14/2012,"A great straightforward fine-ish dining Italian restaurant, with a fairly romantic vibe. Just dressed up enough to not be boring, nothing fancy though. Everything was done correctly, nothing over/under or badly dealt with. I'll put a list review below, but everything was done more or less in the classic style.Fried oysters were one of my favorites, because I like fried oysters and these were big and juicy enough.Tuna tartare was as expected, fine mince, mild acid (lemon?), a little herbage, and a potato crisp.Veal chop + potato gratin was a great main dish. Nothing surprising, just delicious, filling and hearty.Branzino  + salad was again, simple and done correctly. Crispy skin, flaky meat, etc. A mild pan sauce and lightly salted.Sorbets, Gelatos, Smores bread pudding, Plantain cheesecake were for dessert.Gelatos are served at the correct temperature and come with a little crisp.

I ended up bringing a group here of mostly older folks for a work dinner and everyone seemed to enjoy it. A medium-sized dining room has a nice, comfortable feel. Nothing crazy, but just enough wall art to have a bit of character.There were a couple of appetizing specials, but I went with the menu. The oysters were just OK (not titillating), but they might be out of season right now. The New York strip, on the other hand, was a very nice slab of medium rare red meat with bits of bovine fats.

This visit was easily one of the best meals and experiences that I've had at a restaurant.Me and my girlfriend went here for our anniversary and the staff treated us like we were VIPs, it was really a nice touch. From the moment we got there they wished us a happy anniversary and seated us right away as we had a reservation. We got sat down at this nice table in the intimate atmosphere with these really nice mood lights and music. I was loving the atmosphere. I don't think I could've asked for a more appropriate atmosphere than that.We were treated with 2 free glasses of Prosecco which is sparkling Italian white wine. Very nice touch! The olive oil that they have on the table was freaking delicious; I never knew that olive oil could taste like that, it was a complete explosion in my mouth of taste. My girlfriend who has been to Italy told me that it was reminiscent of the olive oil she had in the Italian countryside. As for an appetizer, we decided on the dirty fries which had pecorino cheese and bacon bits... Mmmm delicious. For my entree, I had the duck breast and leg with sunchokes, morel mushrooms, red peppers, mint chutney. I enjoyed this immensely as well. As for dessert, we got a blueberry tiramisu which was awesome! I loved my whole meal there.And at the end of the night when the bill came, I wasn't shocked and there was no desperation sweat where I was wondering how the hell am I going to pay for this.

5.0,8/7/2012,"Hands down, my meal at Giorgio's was probably one of my favorite and most memorable dining experiences to date.I met a friend for dinner during Restaurant Week and stuck to the prix fixe menu. I started with the soup de jour, cream of cauliflower topped with a crab garnish - it came out very quickly (which set the tone for the rest of the meal). It was creamy and smooth and was a great way to start off dinner. My friend got the fried oysters was equally pleased.We both ordered the seared veal chop with a side of potato au gratin for the main course. It was one of the best cooked meats I've ever had in a restaurant. The veal was so tender and juicy and cooked at a perfect medium rare. The portion size was pretty decent too - it was one of those meals that was filling but didn't make you feel grossly full. The potato au gratin was very unique, too. Not too cheesy, but it definitely had that potato au gratin taste to it.Dessert featured s'mores bread pudding with a scoop of vanilla ice cream... I think that pretty much speaks for itself. Delicious.Giorgio's laid back, beat atmosphere tied it all together for me. The decor was classy but not too much, and even though it was a small space I definitely felt we were in our   own little world.

4.0,8/6/2012,"Each time a significant event -- birthday, anniversary, or engagement -- approaches on the calendar, it's hard finding a place that's reliably good without returning to an ""old reliable."" Like a great pair of well-worn shoes, inasmuch as you know those shoes are comfortable and reliable, you'd like to go with something new and/or special. What you don't know is whether you'll come away with blisters or other discomforting results. And such is the New Restaurant Experience as well.Enter Giorgio's of Gramercy. We chose Giorgio's for a party of 8 for a birthday dinner that had been delayed a couple weeks, so when we finally found a good date we chose Giorgio's, despite never having been or heard about it except via Yelp, for several reasons.First, it was highly recommended by several people we trust; second, it was suggested as being a great place for a group to get together in a not-loud but not library-quiet environment. Third, the menu is wonderful. And fourth, not only was the standard menu in place but the Restaurant Week menu had been held over, so there were lots of choices at reasonable prices for everyone in our group, one of whom doesn't eat red meat, another who is vegetarian and another who only consumes fish due to being kosher.We arrived a bit early and enjoyed the bar and the decor -- we checked in with Will, the maitre'd, and kept him advised as to how many of us of the 8 had arrived. Our 7 PM reservation saw only six of us had arrived by 7:30 so we advised Will we'd try and sit and hope our remaining two would appear (which they never did). Will, incidentally, was super-relaxed and never once pressured us or made us feel as if he was juggling tables or that we would need to get in and get out, despite the restaurant being relatively full and our party being somewhat large. Kudos and much appreciation for that.We perused the menu and the wine list -- I think we wound up consuming three bottles of a Rose, so nothing very fancy; however, being the menu was chock-full of tempting choices, it took us a bit to figure out what to order. We wound up with some standard dishes and some specials -- all were great. Our appetizers included the grilled calamari salad, tuna tartare, fresh (fried) oysters, and gazpacho. In addition, we decided to order some side dishes, some of which were served along with the appetizers and some which arrived along with our main dishes. All -- ALL -- of the side dishes are highly recommended. Among them: the Mac and Cheese (plain, without proscuitto); the Mushroom Gratin; Brussel Sprouts; Garlic Mashed Potatoes; and the Herb & Lemon French Fries.Our main dishes included the special Branzino, as well as Filet Mignon, a cappellini dish with chicken, Strip Steak, and the Lamb Chops.All those dishes were tasty as well.Finally, being that it was a birthday celebration (and Will as well as our waitress both -- discreetly -- spoke with me briefly about it to confirm), before we had an opportunity to order desserts, we were presented with a huge platter bearing candles and a sampling of each of that evening's desserts. Put simply, it was a tasty and memorable way to complete the dinner. That, and watching a bunch of forks/spoons tear through Plantain Cheesecake, Espresso Mousse, a Fruit Tart, Pistachio Baked Alaska and a few others I can't recall was also lots of fun.The sum-total of our experience was this: Giorgio's is an old-school, new-style Italian restaurant. Old-school in that the service was wonderful, menschy, and genuine, from Will, the maitre'd, to the waiters/waitresses to the restaurant staff. We really felt comfortable and welcome and that our presence was appreciated, despite the fact two of our party failed to make it and that we stayed for several hours. The new-style part was that each dish, for the most part, was a traditional dish that was altered with a modern twist; specifically, the lamb chops were served with a tomatillo salsa rather than a mint jelly or a chimichurri. I would have probably gone with the standard -- a mint jelly of some sort -- had I known, but this was an interesting change and a new flavor profile that really was interesting. And the only way to change things up is to try new things ;-)And while none of us were big fans of the plaintain cheesecake, it was really interesting. I wouldn't order it -- but having same on the platter gave each of us an opportunity to try something new and different, and even though it wasn't a winner, we are looking forward to returning when they are serving the Mango cheesecake and, hopefully, more of the amazing Smores Bread Pudding ;-)Overall, we had a wonderful evening at Giorgio's and would recommend it without hesitation to friends and family for special events or for a something other than a quickie dinner. Definitely worth the visit and return visits as well :-)",2,0,0,Boogie N.,"Manhattan, NY",39,151,10

5.0,7/30/2012,"Went here for restaurant week and couldn't have chosen a better place. Ambiance was perfect, and service was extremely friendly/accommodating. Their selections for the pre-fixe dinner is great -- I started off with the tuna tartare which I loved, then moved on to the seared veal chop (heavenly -- veal had really great flavor and the mushroom/gruyere/potato gratin was a perfect side), and finished off with the s'more bread pudding (to die for.. every bite just melted in my mouth. A perfect combination of flavors and textures. Definitely one of the best desserts I've ever had in my life). I also tried my friend's capellini entree which was also delicious. I'm normally not a big fan of the long/thin noodles, but the flavor of the dish was so good I didn't really care.I couldn't really refuse their wine pairing supplement for $15  I'm glad I didn't. Their individual selections went very well with each course, and considering the fact that I'm not so well-versed in wines/wine pairings, it was nice to get their recommendations on what would best complement my meal. Definitely worth the price. The bill for each person ended up around $60 - $70, not exactly my most affordable dinner, but what can you expect? And plus, considering everything we got out of the whole experience, we all felt that it was well worth the price. Once my wallet recovers from this trip I'll definitely start planning my return.",0,1,0,Reshena L.,"Manhattan, NY",18,25,6

5.0,7/24/2012,"Best restaurant for my birthday. First of all, this place can actually fulfill your a reservation for a party of 8 (although I ended up with just 6 at the end). I called the morning of, and they were able to accommodate me, no problem, a rarity in New York City. It's located in the Flatiron, and was about 3 blocks away from my hotel, a convenient location for an early birthday dinner before heading to see a Broadway show. We had an early 5 PM dinner, and there was only one other couple in the restaurant aside from us. The ambiance: romantic, intimate, classy, perfect for a nice birthday dinner out with the girls. We were seated near the back for more privacy, and the staff was extremely helpful and friendly. My friend and I ordered the Fritto Miso appetizer and a half plate of Pappardelle pasta--the perfect amount for two people. The Fritto Miso was very similar to tempura--very light, airy, and just the right amount of crunch. The Pappardelle dish in all honestly, was nothing too special, and don't think I would order it again. We had drinks all around, and I was recommended a very nice wine with my dinner that had a hint of saltiness to it, which was a pleasant surprise. The waiter and host knew exactly how much attention to give us--our water glasses were never empty, and everyone was extremely attentive. The BEST part: Since they knew it was my birthday, we received a free appetizer (some salmon tartar on bread, which was mouthwatering), a free chocolate banana pudding dessert (again, amazingly delicious), and free cocktails for the table. All because they knew it was my birthday. I will recommend anyone to come here, especially for a special occassion, and they will treat you like royalty.

5.0,7/18/2012,"Went here last night for restaurant week with my girlfriend and my cousin... Really cant say enough about this place, would like to give some highlights:1. Ordered off the Prix Fixe/Restaurant Week menu2. Shared the Fried Oysters & The Tuna Tartare- Oysters were Very high quality, not overly fried... The Tartare was very good, but standard in my mind and not a standout item.3. Main Course- We both had the Veal Chop which was a very large portion that was cooked perfectly.4. Dessert- I had the trio of Sorbets with warm fudge (vaniila, chocolate, strawberry) was fantastic... My girlfriend has the Smore's bread pudding and she loved it... I had a bite as well, but it was pretty rich for my taste... Would def. recommend for people who like a rich chocolatey, marshmallow dessert.5. Save the best for last.... The Sommelier was insanely professional, friendly, knowledgeable, caring and may be the main reason that we will return to this restaurant.  The gentleman was passionate about his job and gave amazing descriptions of the different wine pairings we had with the Prix Fixe... They had a Nebbiolo Rose from Piemnote region that I believe was the best Rose I have ever had in my life.  When we were discussing an after dinner drink at a nearby bar, we decided we would rather take a recco from the sommelier, when my girlfriend noticed wine from Lebanon... I can genuinely say that neither of us have ever had wine from Lebanon before and the Sommelier learned about the wine from a top guy he worked under in Chappaqua, NY... If you enjoy earthy/dirt type wines like I do, then you will really like this stuff... Light, great finish, if you head here give it a go...

We had a wonderful time.First, the decor is nice, the restaurant isn't too loud, and we felt like it was a good, romantic spot. The service was phenomenal. Everyone was friendly and seemed genuinely interested in our opinions. Both the waiter and the maitre d' were available to us for the entire evening. Water glasses remained filled, plates were whisked away quickly but without interruption.We started with fresh oysters on the half shell with sherry vinegar mignonette, which were indeed fresh. Our beverage choice for the night was Sergio Prosecco. They have a good wine list and great cocktails, so there's definitely something for everyone.For dinner I had the Herb & Mustard Crusted Rack of Lamb with grilled vegetables (squash, zucchini & potatoes) and a  tomatillo sauce. I asked for it to served medium, and it was perfect.My husband had the Pappardelle with duck confit, pea shoots, green olives, and shaved gruyere . He thought it was great and not at all stingy with the duck. He's the kind of guy who really likes quantity (yet remains naturally thin, go figure) and he thought the portions were generous.For dessert I had the plantain cheesecake. I like cheesecake, in theory, but I can't stand it when they're too sweet. This was perfect for me! The plantain taste wasn't overwhelming and definitely wasn't sweet, so it was enjoyable. The husband had a mango peach tart served with vanilla gelato. I think he was disappointed that it was warm, but it was delicious.

4.0,6/24/2012,"This is a really small and cozy high-end restaurant. Thanks to Groupon. I found this restaurant. 48 Dollars with 40 dollars worth of food and 8 dollars dessert. The waitress that served us was really helpful. She explained all the special of the day with really detail. The seafood of the day was some rice with lots of seafood and the portion was big for only 30 dollars(thanks for the warning), and the mussels of the day was with spicy marinara sauce for only 12 dollars.bread basket to start of wasn't that great to start of and because I was extremely hungry, it took 20 minutes to get the appetizer to be served. At the very 1st second the mussels were served, we were shocked by how big the portion is just for an appetizer. I think it can be a meal already. WOW!! I think there were about 24 mussels or more than that!! I am really glad that we did not order something else. Entree was huge as well!! We were both bloated after an appetizer and an entree!! How strange can it be. Back to how it taste. The mussels were well cooked with the perfect amount of spicy marinara sauce. It kinda reminds me of the chinese style mussels were they love to fried it with a bunch of oil. But the sauce with it tasted like a soup based. Some tomato, beans and a little spicy to make it taste better. 5 stars for the appetizer! Oh, and it served with a toasted bread too! the bread was a little over toasted because some part was burnt. I soak the bread into the spicy marina sauce!! Mmm.. arch, I am hungry now :pSeafood entree was good but it worth probably 3.5 stars to me. Should have ordered salmon or something else instead of this. For 30 dollars, the amount of seafood that they gave were PLENTY of it!! Mussels, clams, shrimp, scallops.. There were some chicken, sausage in it too.. I think it was a little too much. The chicken and sausage kinda spoilt the seafood taste. Well, at least to me. Dessert! S'mores bread pudding!! Their signature!! Is a MUST!!! After having bread pudding in Cambridge I haven't had a great bread pudding in NYC!! Giorgio YOU HAVE IT!!! Caramel and some graham cracker with it!!! OMG!!! What else to ask for to complete a meal??Service was EXCELLENT!!

Okay, so they made a mistake.....too bad the Buffalo Mozz just tasted weird.  Onto the Calamari, the rings were breaded in I don't even know what?  The closest thing I can think of was Semolina.  Very bready and no flavor and didn't even seem like the bread crumbs were fried or baked or anything, just thrown on the calamari at the last minute.  As for the chipotle sauce that should have accompanied it, tasted like watered down marinara sauce from a jar.  Barely any flavor!  The rigatoni was alright.  It was edible I suppose but that is about it.  The Orechetti dish tasted gross.  The cream sauce was more like the powdered cheese that comes with Kraft Macaroni and Cheese.  I had read such good reviews about this place and was beyond disappointed when our food arrived.  Would not even give this place a second try.",0,0,0,Bobbi-Anne L.,"Manhattan, NY",0,2,0

The place is really spacious so we didn't have issues with getting a table and it's what you'd expect ultimate date night to be: sleek bar, dim lights, blush couches, etc.  The layout is a bit weird as we sat in the corner, and then had to look up two steps to see more patrons dining.. but it was all good. It's also interesting to note that you can order out and that while Giorgio's has prime real estate...I happen to think it's less ""foodie"" and more..hometown cooking?Food: Radicchio & Endive SaladRadicchio, endive, arugula, medjool dates, marcona almonds, shaved parmesan, citrus vinaigrette- We shared this and they kindly split the salad for us. It was nothing to complain about- fresh ingredients and yummy dressing- $10.I picked our waitress's brain about the pastas and she directed me to the baked Mac and Cheese: a) because I LOVE Mac and Cheese and b) because everyone raves about it here.  She also told me to go with the chicken topping.  It was really really good- ultimate comfort food. Bread crumbs, a good blend of fontina, smoked cheddar & asiago. With all the pastas, you can choose a half or whole portion (whole is a good size). Whole is $14 (with chicken)She also said the prosciutto was a good pairing, if you prefer that. My bf ordered the  Pappardelle with duck ragu, which was in an EVOO sauce-came with pea shoots, and parmesean. I've had better duck ragu and prefer pappardelle in a cream or red sauce but it was definitely nicely homemade and fresh. I don't think my bf liked it too much because he ate a lot of my mac and cheese (which was hands down better- but of course, who can complain about cream and cheese? The fatty stuff wins!)Just when I thought the dessert menu was boring comes along Giorgio's one of a kind: the s''more Bread Pudding, which is Chocolate-marshmallow, caramel sauce, vanilla gelato, and graham cracker.  $8. Needless to say, this was fantastic and I don't even like chocolate or bread pudding that much. It was rather.. not too bread-y and more cakey? Maybe that's why I liked it.. don't miss out in this experience. All in all, service was quick, our waitress was good with water refills and didn't pressure us about wine or give us grief over the Groupon.I'd definitely come back just for that mac and cheese and bread pudding.  They have a pretty varied menu that goes far beyond pasta and if you like meat.. you shouldn't be disappointed as they have a lot of meat mains here that looked pretty big.",4,2,2,Stephanie Y.,"New York, NY",878,1242,25

I opted for the pasta to be whole wheat linguine instead of capellini, and it was delicious all the same. While my waistband benefitted from me abstaining from dessert, it did look mighty yummy.

But with their great and reasonable prices for the great quality they offer - I don't blame them in this economy. Their fresh and both roasted oysters are amazing. However sometimes the roasted oysters with shallots can be a bit too salty for my taste. I guess I prefer the fresh plain buttery taste of a raw west coast oyster without anything added. i wish they would update the menu soon as their scallops dish is the same old for a few years now.

4.0,2/26/2012,"I've been here several times a while ago, but not in recent years. So, needing a table in the area on Saturday night, I decided to try Giorgio's again.We had an 8pm reservation and were seated right away, at a cozy two-top in the middle of the dark red dining room. We had a movie to catch and needed to leave around 9:30, and despite the place being quite busy, our waitress made sure we were out in time. Service was brisk and efficient.The food is still very good. We started with some very fresh oysters, and I then had delicious tuna tartare, rich with cubed avocado and corralled by four fried wonton strips that looked like long, straight fries. My companion started with a radicchio and endive salad that also had arugula, medjool dates, marcona almonds, shaved parmesan and a citrus vinaigrette -- very fresh and well-composed.We both ordered fish for mains -- I had delicious sautéed branzino, filleted and served over seasonal vegetables, and my companion had spiced big eye tuna with manila clams, bok choy and lemongrass-coconut broth, served medium-rare as requested and also very good.Dessert was ""S'more Bread Pudding"" which was more like a large gooey brownie topped with vanilla gelato and a graham cracker -- a bit of a mess on the plate and okay if not memorable.Cocktails and wine are a bit on the steep side, everything else considered: the former are well-made but $15, and a half bottle of Paul Thomas Sancerre ran $28.Overall, though, a fine meal in an enjoyable venue.",0,0,0,J.

4.0,2/21/2012,"My boyfriend took me here for a valentine's day dinner, and it was perfect. He did good this year.We had 8 o'clock reservations and showed up early around 7pm. The place was full since it was vday so we waited by the bar. But even the bar was full so we just stood around for an hour, we didn't mind too much. Just that there wasn't much room to stand around and i felt like i was in people's way. Service was really great. Bartender was a fun guy, recommended a drink for me to buy my bf. The host was extremely nice and genuine, apologizing he couldn't get us an earlier table and checked up on all his guests throughout dinner, which felt really personable. Our waitress was attentive but not annoyingly attentive - she knew exactly when not to ruin a romantic moment (we were exchanging gifts throughout dinner). Not many people can do that so big ups to her.The ambiance and decor at giorgio's is exactly what you would look for in a valentine's day dinner or any romantic restaurant. It isn't too big and not too small, completely full but not too overcrowded.  They had red walls,  chandeliers, abstract paintings (they looked like African art), and also saw there were curtains that could separate each section into a private area.On to the food - Absolutely scrumptious with a few minor complaints. Overall really good.Appetizers:Buffalo mozarella - really good. Only complaint is that it was smaller than I expected.  $9Fried oysters - REALLY good. Must try. Sauce was a tad spicy. Comes with 3 for $12 is actually pretty pricey but worth it.Fresh oysters - half dozen. My first oyster had sand in it, the rest were good.Entrees:Garganelli pasta - the sauce was soooo delicious! Never tasted it before. Highly recommend it. My pasta was just a tad too hard for me though, wish it cooked for a minute more. around $15Scallops - wow. truly amazing. this might be the best scallops dish i have ever tasted. must-have. around $24 Overall, a very nice place for a romantic dinner.  Highly recommended.",0,0,0,Diana C.,"Queens, NY",249,383,268

The fried oysters were very interesting and I really liked the sauce it was topped with as well as the spinach cream. The surf and turf was a bit of a disappointment since there was not much flavor to it and the shrimp was overcooked. The smores bread pudding was delicious and definitely something everyone should try when they come here. Service was excellent; waiters were friendly and the food came very quickly.

4.0,2/11/2012,"I was specifically writing this review because of how impressed I was by having our drinks covered by a minor inconvenience but reading the last few reviews, I realize it's a pretty common occurrence!I dined here with 3 friends on a Friday evening.  One was late, so two of us sat at the bar and got a drink. The bartender seemed to be a jack of all trades as the manager seemed to pull him away twice in the 5 minute span to help with a birthday dessert and then give wine recommendations to a table. Our third friend arrived, but we had to wait for the bartender to return to give us change before we could be seated.The table we got was cozy. We decided to do the Restaurant Week special with the $15 wine pairing (very good deal considering the regular cocktails are $14 each).  I got the tuna tartare appetizer - it was delicious.  The right consistency, tasted fresh, just enough garnish.  The surf & turf was okay - the filet mignon tasted a little fatty and though the prawn was huge, it was not particularly flavorful. I wasn't exactly sure what the veggies were aside from the roasted potatoes, which were good. I saved my appetite for the dessert, the S'mores bread pudding, which was delicious.  But it was such a huge portion, I could not finish it.  All of the wines brought to accompany my courses were good.  Service was good and I even noticed the bartender helped serve our entrees (weird!).When we finished paying the check, we started chatting about something and the manager came by and asked us if he could offer us drinks at the bar as they had a lot of people waiting to be seated.  We were fine with this, and did notice the bar area was packed with people waiting to be seated. At the bar, the bartender helped us pick drinks - I got a spicy margarita (just enough spiciness), my friend got a drink with the cucumber gin and the other friend got a drink with the orange ginger beer and bourbon.  All drinks were tasty. When it came to paying the bill, we were a little unsure what to do - were the drinks on them?  Did we have to pay?  When we finally asked, we discovered that they were complimentary because we had to leave our table - very nice.We started walking home in the chilly weather and snow showers and were already around the corner, when we hear someone calling after us.  It was the bartender!  He thought we had left our leftovers at the bar (I had seen it when I was sitting there but didn't know whose it was) and wanted to return it to us.  We told him it wasn't ours so he went back.  It was very sweet of him though, especially running out without a jacket in the gross weather.They really take care of you at Giorgio's!",1,0,0,Reshma B.,"New York, NY",122,312,6
3.0,2/8/2012,"Came here for restaurant week and ordered the prix fix with wine pairing. I don't like whites but ordered the halibut so told the sommelier and he hooked me up.  Started with a prosecco to help out the fried blue point oysters which were perfectly fried( with too much breading than I would like) sitting in it's shell on a healthy green spinachy puddle and topped with a small dollop of the orangey mayo from new Orleans ( which I had grown to despise during my last trip). Luckily I had convinced myself that I could afford a separate order of the fresh hama hamas on the half shell (6) which thankfully arrived at the same time.  The halibut (which I paired with a glass of Pinot noir) was overcooked, dry, and tasteless, I couldn't finish it.  The mushrooms on the plate were tasty, but the other veggies on the plate offered sweetness that felt out of place.  I ordered the gelato trio for dessert (blueberry, raspberry, mango) but the berries seemed a bit crunchy/ freezer burned so I focused on the mango and my neighbors' smores which I would label as magical ! Probably better off not doing the prix fix and ordering a la carte for focused spending (pricey).",0,0,0,Suzi G.,"New York, NY",150,264,76

1.0,1/31/2012,"I have never had to do this in the 18 years I have dined in the NYC area but this was, by far, the worst dining experience...EVER!!!!  We ordered the surf and turf for Restaurant Week.  My prawn was the consistency of mashed potatoes, the meat flavorless.  My dining companion's dish was overcooked.  When we let the maitre'dknow, he was offended.  We wanted the check minus what we ate (we were willing to do that).  He insisted on giving us two scallops each and a taster's bowl of Bolognesepasta.  With small deduction they offered us the bill and said that they need our table NOW and we must leave.  He offered us seats at the bar that did not exist.There is more horror to the story with our maitre'd that I will not get into but I highly recommend going to a different restaurant if after a small discount you are still paying $100.00 per person forbad food and being treated like shit!  Never ever again Giorgio's!",1,0,0,Susanne S.,"Beacon, NY",8,7,0
2.0,1/28/2012,"If I was rating solely on the experience, there would only be 1 star, but since the food was good, I threw in an extra. It's a small place - as are most restaurants in New York - but Giorgio's has crammed in as many tables as possible. Waiter's butts were constantly in our table and the entire time I was worried our drinks were going to be knocked over. The bathroom is impossible to get to, because you have to climb over humans, coats, purses, chairs and small children. It was out of the restaurant's control, but the large party next to us had an additional guest come mid-dinner, which meant they were impeding on my space of the long booth. The man next to me might as well have dug into my plate since he was practically on my lap. BUT if they had less tables, this wouldn't have been an issue. The kicker was when dinner was finally over, and I was standing at the coat check and the maitre d' asked how everything was. I told him the food was excellent, but it was very tight back there. He looked at me and said, ""Well we are a small restaurant."" I told him that I knew that, but thought there were far too many tables crammed into the place and he said ""Well we've been here for 20 years and that's how it's always been,"" and he walked away.

5.0,1/27/2012,"It's about time I posted an update to my Giorgio's review since it has now become one of my favorite restaurants in the city.  So much so that my husband and I decided to have our wedding rehearsal dinner here in 2010.  They cordoned the semi-private area in the back for us, although other guests had to pass through in order to use the restrooms.  The service was top-notch and we felt well taken care by the maitre d' Will and his staff the entire evening.  It was also a lot of fun picking our favorite items to put on our prix fixe menu, and our guests left stuffed and raving about the food.  In fact, they were worried they'd still be full by the time our wedding meal came around the next day!And yes, the food is still worth raving about.  The menu seems to get tweaked every now and then, but our perennial favorites are always there: the baked macaroni and cheese, to which you can add chicken, prosciutto or lobster (the latter two are excellent additions); the scallops, which are meaty, succulent, sweet and perfectly seared, and hand's down the best scallops I've eaten anywhere; the pasta with lobster and shrimp, which is my second favorite dish after the scallops (see my previous review); and, of course, the s'mores bread pudding.  Giorgio's menu has so many enticing items, but it's hard to pass up getting our favorites since we always seem to crave them.  But I'd be willing to bet that any dish you order here will be cooked to perfection and you won't wish you ordered something else.We've returned a few times since our rehearsal dinner, and Will still remembers us.  We went the other night and had to wait a few minutes while other diners vacated our table, so my husband ordered a cocktail at the bar, which was recommended by Will.  He really enjoyed it, and when it was time for us to be seated, Will told the bartender not to charge us.  That's the kind of service you can expect from Giorgio's, and we've never been disappointed by a dining experience there.  It's such a pleasure being treated so well, and appreciated for our continued business.  For the service, the food, decor and ambiance, it's easy for me to declare Giorgio's as my favorite spot for special occasion dining and give it that coveted 5th star.",4,2,3,Kristine R.,"Astoria, NY",299,363,1

The host sat us in a cozy L-shaped booth, so we could nauseate our fellow patrons in between bites.  I ordered a glass of Malbec which was expensive, but exquisite (with an olive oil undertone) and a full body. Our waiter James showed a great deal of knowledge about the food choices and provided great descriptions (particularly of the food he had tasted). We ordered the duck and osso buco dishes with a side of garlic mashed potatoes.  We told the waiter that we would be sharing, but he misheard us and only put in an order for the duck and potatoes.  Quickly recognizing his mistake after the bus boy delivered our food, James brought us a complimentary tomato, basil and mozzarella (which was so ridiculously fresh and creamy) appetizer, on the house.  He owned up to his mistake and was very professional and apologetic.  Even though I'm not a duck aficionado, I tried a few pieces and was very impressed with the flavors. The meat had a buttery quality and was seasoned very nicely. The dish was accompanied by some scrumptious red pepper gnocchi and baked baby carrots--yum! When my dish finally came out, it was worth the wait.  The osso buco fell off the bone and married beautifully with the creamy mascarpone polenta.  I'd definitely eat this meal with a nice glass of red wine. By the end of our meal, when we thought things couldn't possibly get any better, James bullied us into ordering dessert, which he made clear would be on the house. And to our surprise, he brought us TWO complimentary desserts--two generous bowlfuls of an array of gelato and sorbets (chocolate, strawberry gelato and blood orange sorbet), all of which had just the right amount of sweetness and bite.

4.0,1/8/2012,"My friends and I came to Giorgio's with a Restaurant.com coupon for $25 off the bill. The restaurant has a romantic decor and goes surprisingly deep for a small storefront. We were seated toward the back at a roundtable. Our waiter for the night was overall very attentive, letting us know the specials and refilling our waters often.Our party started with two appetizers: fritto misto and steamed mussels. The fritto misto reminded me of a softer version of Japanese tempura, but the dipping sauces that accompanied the fried vegetables were pretty tasty. The steamed mussels were to die for: the mussels tasted fresh, and the tomato-based sauce was so good that we ate a lot of bread soaking up the juices.The entrees took a while to come out, but it gave us time to partially digest the appetizers. The entrees ordered were the lobster linguine (mine), seared duck breast, gnocchi, branzino (which was a special), and bucatini. The sauce on my dish, to my delight, was the same sauce as the steamed mussels', which made everything taste good, but I would've liked my pasta to have been less al dente. Even so, there was a good amount of seafood and some sizable pieces of lobster meat in my dish. I also tried my friends' duck breast and branzino, both of which were also cooked perfectly and had a lot of flavor. I didn't try the gnocchi and bucatini, but my friends seemed to enjoy them, although both dishes looked pretty heavy.(As a side note, I recall our waiter being a little overwhelmed toward the end of our dinner by a large party sitting behind us. This party had a very loud girl with a valley girl accent that kept asking for spoons so that she could eat her salad. Umm...)None of us had room for dessert, but we were very satisfied with the quality of the food. The prices are pretty hefty, so without the coupon, I'm not sure if we would hit up the restaurant again, but I will try to come back again to try the rest of their menu.

Not only is it reasonable, the food itself is very flavorful and cooked to perfection. I had the spicy sausage pasta dish with tomato creme sauce. It was the perfect lunch portion. I judge flavor based on how much hot sauce I need to dump on my food to make it taste good. Surprisingly, I dumped nothing on this. Friends had the penne vodka something or another, and the other friend had the shrimp linguine. I would have ordered either of those as well. The beet salad for an appetizer was also dressed well, no wilting leaves, no old soggy beats...

3.0,12/23/2011,"Giorgio's of Gramercy, located a short distance from Madison Square Park is a restaurant with a strong local joint feel. Inside the narrow, dimly lit dining room is a loud, boisterous dinner crowd. In front of the restaurant, you'll see a large group of people waiting for tables or sitting at the long wooden bar. When we arrived the maitre d, did his best to seat us. We had no reservations. Within 25 minutes he was able to find us a table and he really made a visible effort which was appreciated by myself and my guest.As for the food, we had the Baked Macaroni and Cheese, Maine Lobster Linguini and Giorgio's Antipasto. The macaroni and cheese was excellent. It was made of fresh pasta and had a lovely smoky flavor, due to the mixture of cheeses used. The Lobster Linguini was really worth the price as there was at least 8 ounces of lobster chunk meat in this dish. I was so surprised because when I was biting into what I thought was the linguini, it was actually lobster chunks. This dish was absolutely delicious. The Antipasto was excellent as well with a selection of cured meats and vegetables. What was outstanding about this was the olive oil that was provided with this dish. It had a nice olive aroma, a quality taste, in my book.We enjoyed our meal here and if you do come, make a reservation as waiting at the bar can be a bit tiring.

5.0,12/17/2011,"My best friend and I came here tonight on a whim needing to eat something after having several glasses of champagne a block over at the champagne school at Flute Gramercy. We noticed the restaurant was pretty packed and we obviously didn't have a reservation so we were worried we wouldn't be able to get in at all. The host, who was very accommodating, said that they were all booked for the evening but they had one table available right then which had a reservation in an hour, would we mind? Of course not, an hour was plenty of time for us to get our eat on!The seating was a little bit tight, and the place was a little noisy, but we were able to rise to the occasion and talk just as loudly as everyone else. We started with the raw oysters with champagne mignonette - they were fresh, and delicious! Then we split the buffalo mozzarella with port poached pear, pecans & balsamic glaze, and the Giorgio's Antipasto dish. Both were delicious and very unique - not your standard Italian fare. I loved the mozzarella in both dishes, it was so delicate and it practically melted on your tongue. My friend and I both have this weird tendency to kind of hum and dance a little when we're eating a particularly good food (part of why we're best friends), and we were certainly doing a bit of that with these dishes!! For the main course, my friend got the gnocchi with braised oxtail ragout, and I got the penne with veal bolognese and shaved asiago. I just started drooling simply from writing out the names of the dishes. Bolognese can sometimes have a tendency to be a bit heavy and fatty, but this was light and flavorful, and the asiago, normally a sharp cheese, was not overbearing at all. It was perfect. The gnocchi was light and just melted away, it wasn't chewy at all, and the oxtail ragout was tender and just a bit smoky. Despite both of us getting a little full about halfway through our entrees, we forced ourselves to finish because they were so good we couldn't bear the thought of wasting a bite! Which also meant that we didn't have room for dessert, though the s'more bread pudding sounded amazing.As promised, we were in and out within an hour but we never once felt rushed.

Each round of drinks took 15 minutes (and a reminder to whatever server wandered by) and they forgot to ring in one of our dinners. When they brought the missing meal it was wrong.

Usually restaurants aren't so nice about that and I was pleasantly surprised.  Really the service here is stand out.  Unobtrusive but inquiring and my water glass was always full.I definitely recommend this as a tasty and affordable lunch spot.",1,0,0,Laurinda U.,"Boston, MA",147,132,6
2.0,11/7/2011,"Was disappointed in this place, very surprised at the yelp reviews on this place.Service 2 (3)*Food 2.5Ambiance 3Service was pretty bad.  This is in the context of a monday night where we were the fifth table in the restaurant. I believe our main waitress was too busy and we waited for menus for over ten minutes.  Then, the waitress's assistant (not sure his exact role) brought us menus.  What seemed like ten minutes more, he came back to take our order as he said she was busy.My starter was the mozzarella with pears.  Be forewarned, it is a 'contemporary' dish with broken up pieces smothered in balsamic and pears built into a tower.  The flavor profile was fine but my mozzarella had a weird texture.  The manager of the restaurant was kind enough to check why that was the case and offered a replacement--this portion provides the adjusted 3 stars for service.My mains was a combo of the pumpkin ravioli, which was too al dente where the dough was undercooked; and, the fritto miso which tasted like it was drenched in oil.  I know it is fried but when the oily residue stays behind...it wasn't worth having...i believe other reviewers mentioned the same thing.Of course we waited another 10 min (no joke) for the check after trying to flag anybody down...our waiter assistant came to the rescue.  If this was a romantic dinner, i might have more patience but this was a biz dinner and i wanted to head home soon.Oddly, we finally met the waitress who brought us our check and removed the charge for my starter--interesting surprise appearance.In this area, you can easily go to basta pasta and/or via emilia (right down the block).",1,0,0,Pat R.,"Manhattan, NY",33,429,0

There was a cozy bar area and the dinning room was warm and inviting. The lighting was low lit and gave a relaxing glow off the deep red walls. It was elegant yet casual so we felt comfortable showing up in our weekend jeans. We were immediately seated and our friendly waiter took our orders quickly. We enjoyed a nice glass of wine and an order of Oysters. And,then we waited, and  waited some more. The table next to us was seated after us and received their dinner and  the table next to them did as well. The manager and waiter keep coming over to apologize for the wait. We ordered a second glass of wine and waited some more. Finally, our meals arrived and sadly they were luke warm. We had to send them back and wait some more. Once we finally ate, the food was delicious. The Penne was light, fresh and full of flavor. I loved the Salmon with Fall veggies. The manager brought over  a slice of pumpkin cheesecake to finish, which was outstanding.The Food and ambiance are very good but the food comes out of the kitchen slowly.

4.0,10/17/2011,"I stumbled upon this place by accident on Saturday night and what a pleasant surprise! It was late and I was cold and hungry. We were on our way to one of the usuals in that hood, Gramercy Tavern etc., when we walked by this place...it was crowded, which is a good sign, so we decided to try it. It was about 10:15 and there were seats available at the bar so we plopped ourselves down. The aroma once you walk in is delish so we were immediately intrigued. The Host was very accommodating, he approached us immediately as the bartender was busy. We ordered a nice bottle of wine and perused the menu. Since it was past 10:30 we decided to split a few things. We ended up getting the pre-fixe to share. The tuna tartare was good, not spectacular...more tuna less red onion and avocado please. The bread is scrumptious, warm and gooey and the olive oil was great. For our main course we wanted the veal chop but it turns out it had sold out. The bartender was apologetic and offered us the filet mignon instead. It came perfectly cooked and was served with some sauteed greens and sliced potatoes au gratin. YUM! We cleaned the plate which we almost never do. For dessert we chose the chocolate bread pudding...now I'm not a huge chocolate fan but I am a huge bread pudding fan. Again, we almost licked the plate!!! We ended up closing down the place and when we finished our bottle the bartender actually poured us a few glasses on the house of wine he had left over.

5.0,10/16/2011,"It takes a lot to impress me as far as dining goes. Normally I first gauge a place by the food then I worry about the atmosphere and decor later. I've been here several times and Giorgio's of Gramercy has yet to disappoint. The place brings its ""A"" game on every level.As you walk in you notice that the kitchen is setup to the side rather than the back of the place so it offers a unique view that overlooks the dining area. If you are one of these people that worries about what goes on behind the closed doors of the kitchen you will be comforted in knowing that this place has nothing to hide and all can be seen. I ordered the Penne Ragu. Al dente, of course. It was in a veal bolognese sauce with shaved asiago cheese. It was fantastic. A lot of times with pasta the sauce can be the main cause for disappointment but the sauce for this dish was quite good. It was nicely paired with the other ingredients which made it excellent. I also tried a gnocchi in an oxtail type of sauce that was also very good. Not sure if it's always on the menu or not. Seems like they are always experimenting with the menu here, which is a sign of how much more progressive this establishment is from other restaurants. Here they also offer many different takes on side dishes. They had a pork belly hash on the menu that night which I have never had anywhere else. I'm hoping that it's a regular item on the menu because it was really delicious. I know pork belly is a fancy word for bacon but they can call it whatever they want and I'm on board. They take walk ins but be sure to make reservations because they do get fully booked even on weeknights. This is a great place to bring a date but I also see lots of parties of 5 or more every time I've been here.

4.0,9/29/2011,"My girlfriend and I came here on a double date a couple weekends back. It gets pretty packed as it's a small space, so definitely make a reservation ahead of time. That said, we had to wait about 15-20 minutes to get seated after our reservation time. What made it back, though, was that the host was very nice in giving us updates on when we'd be seated, and we ended up with a glass of sparkling wine and an order of fried calamari on the house - a very nice gesture indeed, particularly for a Manhattan restaurant. Seating was decent, and the lighting is very nice for a romantic dinner.As for the food itself - the calamari on the house was pretty tasty, as was the fried zucchini that was included with it. For an appetizer, we split the tuna tartare with avocado - not the best tartare I've had (seafood places have a leg up), but the flavors still worked well together. As for the main entrees, the linguine with lobster was delicious - much more lobster than was served at A Voce, and with a very well-textured pasta and tomato-based sauce. My girlfriend had the branzino, which was very good as well, although it was a bit charred on the skin - maybe cooked a little too long? Dessert was a pleasant surprise as well; the espresso-flavored mousse had a deep, rich flavor, but the highlight (and definitely get this if you have dessert) is the s'more bread pudding...so tasty! The chocolate really sets the bread pudding apart from your average dessert.This was a very nice revelation in the neighborhood, and I'll definitely come back (and not just because I scored $25 gift certificates at steeply discounted prices).

However, the foodie in me decided to be fair and give them one more star for the very nice server we had and for the S'more bread pudding that was delicious.I am really angry about the customer service of this restaurant, particularly the manager who out of courtesy will remain unnamed. I called in advance to book a reservation for a party of 17. I work for a non-profit organization in the city and we were coming to Giorgio's to celebrate a the close of a project we had just successfully finished. I was super happy about going here because of all the great reviews. I let the person who took my reservation know that we were interested in the prix-fixe dinner menu and he said, ""no problem."" Keep in mind the online menu says NOTHING about a party number limit for the prefix. As the meal was coming to a close we handed the server our NY State Official Tax Deduction form. As a non-profit we get this benefit.  I have lived in NYC for 6 years and have used this form more times than I can even think of. My boss, who has lived here for 16 years has also used the tax deductible form and has NEVER been turned down. To my surprise, the manager approached our table and in front of all 17 people began to explain to me why they couldn't take the form. He continues to say, they should have known in advance and that he was not going to accept the form. He then proceeds to say that they shouldn't have given us the prefixe dinner in the first place because they don't do it for parties over 12. Again, NO ONE ever mentioned this to us. The manager continued to try an prove his point IN FRONT OF EVERYONE as I firmly yet politely objected to his reasoning and tried to keep my cool.After we paid and were heading out I approached the manager to explain that I was very disappointed and would not be returning to Giorgio's. He tried to apologize, but failed as he proceeding to rebuttal all of his actions and decisions and therefore not really apologizing.  I explained to him that in the 6 years of living here our group had never been rejected by a restaurant when using our tax form and that it was COMPLETELY INAPPROPRIATE to discuss this issue in front of all 17 of my coworkers. A professional manager would have pulled me aside to explain the problem. All in all, even though I don't agree with his reasons of ""needing to know in advance"" the main problem I have is in the way he treated/belittled/embarrassed me in front of the dinner party. I also think a true professional would have said ""we will take it tonight but for future reference let us know in advance.""

4.0,7/12/2011,"Giorgio's of Gramercy is probably the best restaurant that you have never heard of.  I consider myself extremely aware of the Manhattan food scene (go ahead, quiz me - I dare you!), but the name of this destination was completely foreign to me until recently.  There had been no buzz, no chatter, only a fateful coupon from one of those deal sites.  However, that was all it took to make me fall in love...The service here has been some of the friendliest around.  The host staff works hard to ensure that you are seated at a table where you feel comfortable (many are in tight corners), and the kitchen will even allow you to reformat their prix fixe meal using the standard menu items of your choice.  The food is consistently delicious, but the rich sauces make this a destination fit for foodies rather than the faint of stomach.  The flavors are typically well-composed and executed.  Each meal will start with a basket of amazing Italian bread, though it is served room temperature, rather than fresh from the oven.By this time, I have dined at Giorgio's several times, though have failed to write a review up until this point.  So, I am going to just highlight some of the dishes that I have sampled.  The Caramelized Sea Scallops were perfectly seared in a balsamic reduction and served with a cheesy fondue of crisp cauliflower florets.  Golden raisins and roasted almonds enhanced the unbelievable flavor.  However, the Maine Lobster Linguini was only marginal, due to over-cooked pasta, lobster, and shrimp.  The basic pomodoro sauce was nothing special either.  Transitioning back to the positive, the Seared Grouper was perfectly cooked.  It was served with a turnip and sage puree, which resembled chunky mashed potatoes and had been infused with a white truffle oil that could be smelled the moment it reached the table.  Wilted rocket greens and a large oven-roasted tomato were other earthy accompaniments that elevated the dish.  The Black Truffle Mascarpone Chicken was as decadent as it sounded...well, flavor-wise at least.  Luckily, it still managed to remain light, even after consuming an entire platefull...The large portion of poultry was stuffed with spinach, sun-dried tomatoes, and smoked Gouda.  The beautiful red and green stuffing artfully oozed from the moist bird.  The meat was served with perfectly done potatoes, fresh broccoli rabe, and a spectacular lemon thyme sauce.Though I did not sample any of the restaurant's appetizers, I have yet to end a meal without a serving of their signature S'mores Bread Pudding.  The cake portion was bound together with gooey chocolate marshmallows and a sticky caramel sauce.  A sprinkling of graham cracker crumbs and mini-marshmallows was spread across the top.  Though a vanilla gelato was supposed to accompany the dessert, I have substituted it with both raspberry and pineapple sorbets.  The raspberry had a superior, bolder flavor, but both were good compliments to the decadent treat.  Giorgio's of Gramercy really provides a seamless dining experience.  I would love to get the word out and increase their buzz, but at the same time, do I really want to compete for my next reservation...Ah, the conundrum....",4,0,1,Alison C.,"Hoboken, NJ",1125,1410,640
2.0,7/11/2011,"Giorgio's is one of those places I've wanted to eat at for years, but somehow never got around to trying it out. After the wait time was too long to deal with at ABC KItchen (I should have known better), the stars finally aligned and the nearby Giorgio's became our fallback. I was actually surprised by the decor. For some reason I wasn't expecting it, but it reminded me of a slightly more toned down Strip House. Lots of reds, dim lighting, and a swanky feel that probably made it ""the spot"" when it opened in 1991. While the look may be a bit dated, it was refreshing since it felt like a throwback. The generously sized booth they gave us was also nice, and so was the strong AC on a hot night that so many restaurants seem to skimp out on.There was a $35 prix fixe menu that caught my eye, and it definitely seemed like good value - but with entrees priced in the $18-25 range and appetizers around $8-10, it only seemed worth doing if I really wanted three courses. I wasn't hungry enough and after reading great things about the mac and cheese (which wasn't on the prix fixe menu), I decided to go with the lobster mac and cheese. Our waiter fully endorsed my choice, saying it's one of the restaurant's best dishes. My girlfriend went with a linguini with lobster dish.I was pretty excited to see a generous portion when our food arrived, and I ate my food pretty quickly. I finished it all because I was pretty hungry, but I wasn't impressed. The cheese sauce (which I think consisted of 3 or 4 cheeses) was more watery than savory. The bigger problem was the lobster though. It tasted really fishy, as if it was sitting around for a few days. My girlfriend noticed the same thing about the lobster in her dish and both of us felt that questionable feeling you'll get when you eat a piece of bad fish.The service started out fine and our waiter was really friendly, but the way the end of the meal was handled turned me off a bit. He asked us if we wanted dessert and we declined. I can't remember whether we specifically asked for the check or not at that point, but it's pretty implied that you want a check if you don't want dessert. I can't think of many restaurants that won't give it to you if you don't ask for one. 15 minutes went by without a check and we finally had to ask for it before we got one.Maybe I caught this restaurant on a bad night or ordered the wrong dishes, but I can't see myself going back here with so many other Flatiron dining options nearby.",2,0,0,J B.,"Austin, TX",15,95,1

5.0,6/9/2011,"I had the pleasure of dining at Giorgio's of Gramercy yesterday, courtesy of a $30 Groupon. We arrived at 6 p.m., were greeted by a friendly maitre d', and seated at a cozy corner table. Ambiance/Decor:The restaurant gives off a romantic and intimate feel. This is an excellent place for an anniversary dinner or just a date. The walls are red and the lighting is dim so the mood is just right for romance. The restaurant is on the smaller side so I imagine that on a busier night or later (we were kind of early-bird specialing it), it might get a little noisier so if you're looking for a quiet meal, go from 6-7p.m. Service: The waitress was very helpful and checked in on us just the right amount of times. As we were contemplating ordering wine, she notified us that we could sample any wine by the glass, which was a very nice gesture. Once we had ordered, she brought out a complimentary amuse-bouche, a lovely sausage/mashed potato spread on toast. It was quite tasty and helped to tide us over until our entrees arrived. The table bread was also very good, crunchy on the outside with some toasted sesame seeds and soft on the inside. The waitress also brought out some olive oil and a very generous serving of grated Parmesan as per our request (gratis). Food:We shared the roasted chicken ($19) and the rack of lamb ($28) along with a side of garlic mashed potatoes and a side of roasted carrots ($5/ea.). Everything was PERFECT. The chicken was prepared immaculately. The skin was crunchy and golden while the meat remained juicy and tender. It was served over a bed of small baked potatoes and frisee, which both had a very subtle citrus taste. This was an extremely well executed dish with refreshing, light flavors. The rack of lamb featured 7 pieces of perfectly cooked and seasoned lamb. The sauce, a rich red sauce complemented the meat really nicely, without overpowering it. The lamb was served over a bed of assorted vegetables (zucchini, squash, eggplant), which were simple and delicious. The sides were also wonderful: the carrots were buttery and just the right consistency and the mashed potatoes weren't overcome with garlic. Overall, this was a tremendous meal: simple dishes, perpared to perfection. Of note: The chicken does take a little while to be prepared. The waitress notified us of the slightly longer than usual prep-time at the beginning of our meal--it was well worth the wait!) Pricing:For two 5 star entrees and two side-dishes, the bill came out of $63, which is a true steal for a great meal in NYC.

4.0,5/26/2011,"For those that know me, ""New American""  is not my go-to comfort food nor are they cuisines that I purposely seek out.Once in a while, I stumble upon these restaurants, with most  of the time through birthday dinners.However, I must say that Giorgio's of Gramercy impresses me.  The decor and interior is intimate and inviting.  Great place for romantic date or to catch up with really good friends in a relaxing atmosphere.For appetizers, we tried the calamari fritti and the bruschetta.  The calamari was how you expected in a nice establishment: fresh, lightly fried, and cooked with fresh ingredients.The bruschetta however was a mixed bag.  It was a fancy bruschetta, filled with braised octopus.  The octopus was a bit plain, despite being braised and the breads they offered were so little.  The tomato was not ""citrusy"" enough, which was a shame.However, I wasn't going to let that ruin my main course.  I tried the Seared duck breast, which comes with warm barley salad with grapes, almonds, red onion, and oregano.  The seared duck breast was A-mazing with a capital A. A generous portion; Lightly seared but big on taste. The duck was executed really well, something I am surprised in an American style restaurant (since I like duck prepared in Asian restaurants).  Never dry but always juicy and well seasoned.  Succulent is how I'd describe it.  I was very surprised with the grapes and thought that was a great compliment to the duck.  Eat it together with the duck and it adds a savory sweetness to it. Perfect.I ordered 2 sides to go with the duck.  The garlic mashed potato was a bit bland and really could not taste the garlic. I'd skip this and get another side dish.However, the roasted Brussels sprouts in whole grain mustard amazed me.  Naturally roasted is the best way to eat Brussels sprouts and when it's drizzled with whole grain mustard, it adds even more oomph to it.  Slightly bitter and crunchy (never soggy or soft), it has the natural taste of how a Brussels sprout should taste, and then some. If you're a fan of them, do order them! I'd like to add the service is great and the staffs are very attentive to detail. That's one thing I truly admire in these type of settings; you get good service.",2,0,2,Wing L.,"Long Island, NY",201,245,78

3.0,5/5/2011,"Few meals are trickier than planning a celebratory dinner for your boss and senior coworkers. The location should be classy and the ambiance moderately quiet (lest those insider secrets are overheard). The table should be intimate yet maintain casual professionalism. All dietary restrictions should be accounted for (in this case, allergies to peanuts, an aversion to meats that look like their original animal counterparts, and a preference for steak and potatoes), yet the menu should offer enough selection for picky eaters. And of course, your selection and diner satisfaction will likely reflect upon those year end performance ratings concerning your ""team player attitude"" and your street cred at the water cooler. Luckily for me, I have Yelp. Giorgio's was a great choice - it was classy, bold (red walls and floral chandeleirs anyone?), with an impressive but friendly menu that wasn't outrageously priced. Given two days notice, they were able to accomodate a table for six. Within half an hour of our 6:30 reservation, all tables were occupied.The table started with the house cabernet sauvignon (which left most quite happy) and a tuna bruschetta which had a great texture and light taste. After a fairly long wait, we put our various orders in. Reviews during the appetizers were mildly positive (clam chowder, mussels of the day, calamari, and a buffalo mozzarella). After several awkward pauses in conversation and multiple water refills and a third bottle of cab, we were still waiting for entrees half an hour after appetizer plates were cleared.The meal was great - sirloin steaks, duck ragout parpadelle, the famous mac and cheese, seared tuna, veal chops - but the extraordinary slow service turned most of us off.

Staff was very helpful, friendly and attentive. Here's what I ordered and tried off the RW menu:-soup du jour: chickpea soup: delicious! smooth, creamy and tasty! A full meal in itself!-braised lamb shank: large lamb shank with gnocchi. I felt the dish was rather bland. The lamb was tender and soft and not gamey.-s'more bread pudding: very rich but really good! chocolaty gooeyness with graham crackers and vanilla gelato. A great way to end the meal!-pumpkin cheesecake: full of pumpkin flavor, but not the best cheesecake I've tasted.For the appetizer, I actually ordered something like a bruschetta but instead of tomatoes on top of the bread, there was something similar to a duck pate. It was pretty good...forgot the name of the dish though.The portions were quite generous here; I was rather impressed by that. I felt the best part of the meal was the s'more bread pudding though.

4.0,2/7/2011,"Due to the horrible weather, I wasn't able to go to a lot of different venues for Restaurant Week this winter, and Giorgio's of Gramercy was the second and final stop. On the brighter side, this was a much more pleasant experience than I had at Destino.The restaurant is relatively small, but I like the overall ambiance. Our waiter was friendly and attentive, and I think he was also the bartender. I had the Mizuna Salad, Veal Chop, and Sorbet Trio, with a glass of Prosecco, while my friend chose the Fried Oysters, Braised Lamb Shank, and S'more Bread Pudding.The salad was delicious, loved the prosciutto and pomegranate combination. The veal was alright, kind of on the boring side. I enjoyed my tangerine sorbet even though I was supposed to have mango and raspberry originally, but they ran out. My friend did mention that it's difficult to make anything braised delicious, so he must've really liked his lamb.I would love to return to try more of their dishes, especially because of the laid-back yet sophisticated atmosphere.",0,0,0,Claire W.,"Fresh Meadows, Queens, NY",201,83,14

I felt a little under dressed as I was wearing a purple t-shirt and red sneakers, but the host or the staff never gave me any condescending looks. In fact, everyone was EXTREMELY nice and accomodating. We went nuts on the appetizers so they threw in one more free one (roasted oysters) for good measure.The APPs were amazing. Everyone at the table agreed that the group of apps ranked within everyone's top 10 of all time. We split: Penne Bolognes (AWESOME), Mac & Cheese (AWESOME), Fried Oysters (Very Good), Arugula Salad (Very Good), Roasted Oysters (AWESOME). The best entrees were the lamp chops, the braised lambshank, the risotto (probably the best) and the chicken.

The service was great too, from the host to the waitress to the food runners.To start, we got the buffalo mozzarella with date confit on grilled ciabatta with thyme & rosemary oil. It was very tasty, with the saltiness of the cheese matched with the sweet date confit. They also provided us with amuse bouche: spicy shrimp on cucumbers. They were really good too.For my entree, I got the linguine with lobster, shrimp, and haricot verts in a tomato sauce. A few of the pieces of linguine were a little chewy, which was unfortunate, but the flavors were excellent and hit the spot on a snowy night.My boyfriend got a special: a pork chop in a veal demi-glaze served with a potato and olive salad served with a goat cheese sauce. The potato and olive salad was amazing...something I definitely would like to make at home all the time! The pork chop was really good too, although a little dry in places.For dessert, we got the s'mores bread pudding, which was truly heavenly.

On new year's day, after servicing a hangover for 12 hours, we finally decided to leave the apartment and walked around without a defined plans in mind other than to find an Italian restaurant. Otto and the new pizza/pasta joint in Eately were in the back of our minds but we wanted something different. We wandered past Giorgio's and decided to give it a try. The food was wonderful. I had the duck salad and braised short ribs. My girlfriend had the arugula salad and pappardelle with a rabbit ragu (amazing). We shared the chocolate bread pudding for dessert.

The braised beef ribs were perfectly cooked, the meat full of flavor and easily separating from the bone. Olive tapenade was a nice complement and the polenta good if not remarkable. The S'mores bread pudding uses quality vanilla ice cream, had a strong chocolate flavor without being overly sweet, but I had probably been happier selecting a different item .

The food was decent. Not fantastic, but ok. The meats - hangar steak, rack of lamb, leg of lamb special - were a little on the chewy side. All dishes lacked salt. What annoyed us the most was the self-serving waiter who insisted that the portions are sized for individuals. Unless you are Andre the Giant or on some other 12,000 calories a day diet, assume that an appetizer is for two, a half portion pasta dish will be ample and a regular main course is more than enough for two.

I had the crab fritters, the veal chop and the s'more bread pudding. I also went with the wine pairing, which was very nice. The crab fritters themselves were nice. There were two large crab fritters and A LOT of baby arugula. The amount of baby arugula was a bit of a turn off. It seemed very unnecessary and pretty lackluster. The crab fritters would have been much nicer as 4 small ones, as opposed to 2 large ones. I also did not seem to taste the yogurt citrus vinaigrette, which made the dish lack acidity. My friend got the soup du jour, which was beet and yogurt soup served room temperature. The flavors were very nice, but again, a huge portion! I had the veal chop with mushroom stuffing as my entree. The meat was pretty nice and so was the stuffing. The veal chop was on top of, once again, a ton of arugula. I thought I had enough after the crab fritters, but this time the dressing was very nice.For dessert I had the s'more bread pudding, which was alright. The bread putting was pretty large and the scoop of ice cream could have been larger in order to balance the flavors. Without the ice cream it wasn't so good. I wish it had more chocolate and less marshmallow (but maybe that's because I'm a chocolate lover) Overall, the decor was very nice and the service was excellent.

The risotto was great as well, creamy and smooth, with a bit of bite to it, the texture was perfectly done. Our entree was the sesame seared big-eye tuna. I did like the unique sesame-encrusted outer layer of the tuna, but the flavor did not penetrate all the way through to the center, and the soba noodles could have had a little more flavor.

I ordered takeout, a caesar salad, chicken sandwhich and cheese raviolo totalling about $23. The only food that I'd consider decent was the chicken caesar sandwhich and that had wilted lettuce.The caesar side salad had brown lettuce that was supposed to be green and the dressing was on it in the bag which is rare, usually when you get takeout they put the dressing on the side. The cheese raviolo was subpar, it may be wish I'd gone to Olive Garden even though Olive Garden has pathetic food. Giorgio's cheese ravioli was hard, chunky and overly sauced. I finished it but only because it was my only meal of the day.The frontline employees I dealt with were nice but the chef seems to be the one needing some work here. Also it is unwise to serve challah with italian food, they really just don't mix.Next time I don't want to go far to get dinner I'll once again go to Bravo Pizzeria about a block from Giorgio's where the slices are tasty and I can get enough food to feed three people for the price to feed one at Giorgios, and at Bravo the food actually tastes good unlike Giorgios.I am amazed that Giorgio's has such high ratings considering its dismal food but I suppose a whole star could be recovered if I was to dine-in.",0,0,0,Andrew F.,"Los Angeles, CA",181,352,219

The sommelier was also helpful and provided us with a beautiful bottle of champagne and lovely after dinner drinks for the bride and groom.  The food itself was amazing, and several in our party remarked that it was the best meal they had eaten!  The decor was even better than it looked online, with dark red walls, and a velvet curtain that separated our room from the main dining room and was atmospheric and romantic. Last, but not least, we pre-ordered a small, simple wedding cake and it was truly delicious with fresh strawberries between layers. The staff/owners really know how to make their guests feel welcome and provide them with a great meal, and that is why I will DEFINITELY be back and recommend it to everyone! Giorgio's of Gramercy is smart to pay attention to both food and service and that is why they have been in business so long!  Highly recommend!",0,0,0,nik n.,"New York, NY",0,6,0

We shared the spinach/goat cheese salad for an appetizer, then she had the penne with vodka sauce dish where I had the BBQ Burger. Oh my goodness! This burger was so big and juicy, it was simply to die for. I was so stuffed from lunch, I had to walk out slowly from this place when we left. It was cooked just like I asked, and the cheese, onions, bacon and bread on it were all good. I was very happy I came in here.",0,0,0,Kate S.,"New York, NY",79,693,3305

3.0,5/5/2010,"Love the decor of this place, intimate, cozy, and quite glamorous. Since it was my first time at Giorgio's I opted for their Prix Fixe. To start, I had the grilled shrimp salad over baby spinach tossed with bacon bits and honey mustard vinaigrette. This was probably one of the best salads I've had in recent memory. As for the main, the fillet mignon was cooked well, but was nothing too special. As for dessert, whenever I see bread pudding on a menu, I can never resist, although the s'more bread pudding here was just bit on the sweet side. Overall, I think it was a above average, for sure.

3.0,5/1/2010,"I've walked past Giorgio's several times and was either too early for dinner or too late and didn't feel like waiting.Foresight and planning resulted in reservations for a Friday night so at long last I'd be able to give Giorgio's a try.The restaurant is impeccably decorated, with rich red walls, dim lighting and various floral accessories. A candlelit bar greets the entrant and a step up leads to the dining area. (Likewise, watch your step after eating!)Service from our waitress to the host was also impressive. We were given enough time to study the menu, were asked if we had any questions and then the staff checked in to see if everything was satisfactory.Giorgio's has an eclectic American menu leaning towards Italian. A $35 prix-fixe menu offers up a choice of two salads/soup, entree (fish/filet mignon/shrimp tagliatelle pasta) and dessert (s'more bread pudding/gelato/sorbet/fruit cup).I started with the salad of grilled shrimp served over baby spinach, crispy bacon, quail eggs and mozzarella cheese with honey mustard vinaigrette. This was a winner as the smaller boiled quail eggs (compared to chicken eggs) and slices of mozzarella complemented each other nicely-- one did not overpower the other.Moving on to the entree, here is where I became slightly confused. My order was of the shrimp tagliatelle puttanesca:  (watch your mouth!) anchovy, calamata olives, capers, basil, red pepper flakes.I usually consider tagliatelle to be a long, thin, flat strip of pasta. Apparently these strips were combined into a round shape and stuffed with several of the ingredients. It seemed more a tortellini than tagliatelle. The presentation was easy on the eyes (no cheap puttanesca for me, thank you very much) but the taste wasn't quite what i expected. The ingredients were fresh but my previous puttanesca experiences had set up different expectations that weren't met by what was on my plate.On the other hand, the bread pudding was a great way to end the meal. Topped by a small scoop of ice cream, the bread pudding was quite tasty.All in all, Giorgio's has a pleasant atmosphere, friendly staff and a slightly confusing tagliatelle. It's worth checking out if in the neighborhood, especially for their prix-fixe specials. (There's one for lunch as well)",3,0,1,Tom K.,"Forest Hills, NY",337,820,47
2.0,4/28/2010,"I was looking forward to going to giorgio's for sooo long after reading all of the great reviews so I decided to take my brother there when he visited this past weekend To start off service was slow but they were very busy. We must have waited 15 mins to order before flagging down a waitress which I hate to have to do but no one had come over. For apps my bro had the calamari which he said was great, I had the buffalo mozzarella was was good but not great.  My salmon entree was pretty enjoyable, the cous cous combination not great though. My brother got the steak and hated it.  It was under cooked and not tasty.  The most disappointing thing however was the dessert. We had baked alaska since it's a favorite of ours. It was hard as a rock! It had to have been frozen and then semi defrosted. Wtf? We were seriously stabbing at it with our utensils trying to break off a piece, which was basically just like chipping away at ice.  It was hardly edible and left me with a stomach ache. So everything about the dinner was just meh, from the service to the bread on the table, to the cous cous, and steak, and then the gross dessert at the end.  it literally left a bad taste in my mouth.

4.0,4/25/2010,"Came on a Saturday evening for dinner. I had made a reservation for 8pm, but we happened to be in the neighborhood and hungry at around 6, so we asked if they would seat us early and they were so pleasant and accommodating! The maitre'd and servers were an absolute delight as people and as restaurant staff. The decor is plush and sexy-- shades of crimson and maroon. Lots of damask curtains and plum leather, red walls and modernish art. We had a corner booth with cushions-- made us feel important. The music was surprisingly dominated by the Beatles-- either covers or the originals. It was unexpected but not unpleasant. I had planned on doing the $35 prixe fixe, but when our server told me that the pasta special was a butternut squash ravioli with shrimp, I was fixated on it and had to order it. I was not disappointed, it was very well executed and delicious. Flavorful and not overwhelming. However, when my friend let me try her sugar-glazed salmon with green chili coulis....I could have died and gone to heaven. It was lighter than air, perfectly glazed, and divine. I was almost entree-jealous. Then, the S'more Bread Pudding was everything I could hope for. Chocolate-marshmallow dream accompanied by gelato and an amazing cinnamon graham cracker that reminded me of a really fancy cinnamon Nabisco from childhood (that's a good thing!). The wine list was quite nice, I had a nice Marlborough Sauv Blanc that went well with my meal. My friend's rose was nice too. All in all, all three of us only paid about $35 each (plus tip), which made me less regretful about not doing the prix fixe.

1.0,3/6/2010,"I was looking for a restaurant in the area and after reading the menu and reviews I was impressed. Unfortunately the execution was not there. The amuse usually sets the tone of the meal and it was inedible, the rest was forgettable at best. The only thing that was decent was the penne with creamy veal ragu. All the other items were not balanced and not tasty and much was left on the plate. Now the worst part of the experience the service. It felt like it was the servers first night ever serving. He didn't know the menu he read the specials off a sheet a paper. He brought the wrong beer to my husband who pointed to it on the menu. He took so long to come back and check on us he missed out on us buying a bottle of wine. We ordered a glass of wine instead and he said they were probably out of the wine so we said if so bring us another, when he came back with the wine we had to ask which one it was and it was in fact the first one he said they may be out of. The worst part of the dinner was the really awkward host that came over in the middle of our dinner and asked us how everything was then really strangely spun on his heels and left the table.

5.0,2/7/2010,"""if I ever go looking for my heart's desire again, I won't look any further than my own back yard"" The Wizard of Oz.I had no idea this little gem of a resto was so close to me all this time.Giorgio's is four blocks from home. I've walked by it hundreds of times. I had hardly given it a thought.  Maybe it was the name.... I honestly thought it was a hair salon or something. And, well, it doesn't exactly look all that exciting from the outside. No one had mentioned it to me as a good neighborhood spot, hadn't heard anything about it at all, good or bad.But I needed a place for Friday start-of-the-weekend cheese course..and its been really cold..so I did a little recon of neighborhood spots that I might have overlooked.Sure enough, Giorgio's has a cheese course, a nice looking menu and some fab sounding desserts. Only problem was that the cheese course was on the dinner menu.... So I called to ask: can they make me a cheese plate for lunch? Of course, we can! Extremely pleasant. Good sign. I was feeling pretty good about this adventure already.I arrived. It was late in the lunch service, but the staff was completely engaged in taking care of the few diners still eating. I was seated at a very nice table in a very pleasant, if simply decorated room. Much as I suspected, it was not some wildly exciting interior, maybe a bit stodgy, definitely reflective of a place that had been opened for a long time and serving the neighborhood without interest in pretense.My waiter was just remarkable. A young man, very polite and gracious and totally into his work.  I have to think he is in the owner's family because he couldn't have seemed to enjoy being there more or have been more concerned with making my dining experience a positive one.We discussed wines, he gave me a couple to try.  Liked them both. Wine list seemed quite decent even for the by- the- glass selection.Then, I asked about the cheese plate: of course we can do that!   Within a few minutes, one of the most attractive, well prepared cheese courses ever was delivered. Good cheese selection, lots of contiments, nuts, fruit pates, salad greens, toasted bread, all piled up in an architectural arrangement. Now, my admiration of this cheese plate has to be considered with some gravity as I have had about 1000 cheese courses in this town, so I like to think I know a good one when I see it. This, my friends, was a damn good one.My waiter described the various cheeses and said that the Chef had prepared it himself. I'm feeling like royalty at this point, seriously.Oh, and I forgot one of the best parts: they were playing Beatles music the entire time I was there. Not just any Beatles music, but the psychedelic stuff from the later years. It was pretty surreal to the point of being amusing. But it was somehow just right.I also had the butternut squash cheesecake with some yummy spiced ice cream, beautifully prepared.My entire bill was very reasonable. I know I will be back for the cheese and I can't wait to bring the fella in for dinner one night soon.I debated giving 5 stars. I try to save that for really exceptional places and once in a lifetime experiences.  But Giorgio's does what it tries to do so well, that I can't rate it as anything less than best of its kind.",4,2,3,Karin G.,"New York, NY",185,568,7

It was a cold and damp night, and the small size of the restaurant made it a warm and inviting place to sit down. The staff really couldn't have been nicer or more thoughtful. Our coats were taken from us cordially and brought to a closet downstairs, we were immediately seated even though the place was quite full.The decor was lovely, especially the under-lit onyx bar separating the dining areas. For new years, they had floated gold balloons up to the ceiling and let their tails hang down to just above head height. This made the place look festive but not overdone. Our waiter was very attentive and all of our needs were met with a smile and a good attitude.To start, I had their soup... Honestly I was looking to just warm up. The soup was very good, but really nothing to rave about. However, this fact was certainly masked by the incredible entree. For my second course I ordered the Osso Bucco. It was really done to perfection, The meat fell off the bone with a light glaze that melted in your mouth. It was truly a delight to eat. We were a little short on time that evening and the waitstaff made sure that we got our dishes in short order. Everything came out fast and at temperature.

The broccoli rabe was a bit too potent to the taste buds for me, but the meal was filling.No desserts this time - but we plan to return.

4.0,9/26/2009,"I want to be a kind person today, so I'm going to rate Giorgio a 4 instead of 3.5.  Recently, I've been having a lot of crappy meals (you could read my previous reviews) either service or meal problem, so finally eating the food the way I wanted it to be prepared was a blissful moment.  My companion and I dined here on a Friday afternoon.  Situated on a secluded street away from the large avenues, the restaurant was near empty except for a couple of tables who were probably regulars.  They were chatting and joking with the staff, which eased me because that meant the restaurant must be good to have repeats.  Not a surprised, the RW menu is still being offered (really, it should be a Restaurant Year menu. Let's be realistic now) and for $24.05, the food they offered was a pretty good deal.  As an appetizer, you get to choose a grilled shrimp salad or a mixed green salad.  Of course you want your money's worth, go yea, my friend went for the seafood.  It was a decent portion as well.  Then for entree, let me give you a lesson here. Unless you can't live without carbs or a vegetarian, almost always get the seafood.  One of the option was an alfredo pasta, but why get that when you can have scallops? Besides, I would never cook this shellfish at home (probably would turn it into rubber instead with my cooking skill), so get something you know you won't create at home.  My friend was pleased with the scallops. A bit too charred, but the meat was tender and not overcooked.  And for dessert, she went for the grand finale of the chocolate marshmallow bread pudding a la mode.  That was a gut buster. It was extremely chocolately, so get that only if you're a caffeine fiend.  Ok, so what about me? I went for something really simple - grilled salmon with steamed vegetables.  When I have seafood, I like to let the main character shine.  Don't drench my fish with sweetened sauce or pepper, that's just a cover up in my opinion.  Although my pink buddy (aka salmon) isn't wild caught, it was adeptly cooked, except again, for the over-charred skin.  The kitchen should really clean the grill. For the customers' health sake at least. We don't want to die from cancer.  So overall, it was an enjoyable meal.  The staff was wonderful as well. My water glass was always filled and I'm a water fiend.  So what stopped the star from reaching for a 5? Well, I got my check before we even finished dessert. Ooo...a big no-no. Don't ever give a check to the customer until you see them holding their stomach from fullness and a napkin thrown across the plate.  I was quite annoyed at this action.  Also, she came back again in 5 minutes and I didn't even put my credit card inside yet.  Do you want to throw us out so soon?? Otherwise, it was a nice experience and I hope this restaurant gets busier during dinner time.

They actually deserve only 1 star but I'll add a star due to service.I just went here yesterday for a belated birthday dinner treat from my lovely T.This was actually T's second choice since the first choice was closed on Monday.I had a feeling the food wouldn't be good by the Amuse Bouche they served to us.  ECK!  It was salmon on a toasted baguette - so not good at all.We both got the Soup du Jour - Butternut Squash Soup.T enjoyed it but I like my Butternut Squash to be more smooth rather chunky and sweet.T wanted scallops, so she got the scallop - I thought the scallops tasted too mushy.I ordered the linguine with seafood.  T was surprised I ordered pasta since I usually order fish as my entree.  I don't like to order fish from places that I never been to and this rule applies to meat as well.I feel like pasta dishes are always a safe choice, since I never had bad pasta.  NEVER, until yesterday night!I like my pasta cooked al dente but not pasta that's undercooked.  The pasta was hard and tasted disgusting.  I decided just eat the seafood and skipped the pasta.  The shrimp that was in my pasta was OVER cooked!  Shrimp tasted dry, but if I didn't eat that, I didn't have anything else to eat in my bowl.  So I ended up eating the shrimp and ate the lobster bits in the lobster mashed potatoes.T and I were really excited about this side dish - lobster mashed potato but it came out dry.  It wasn't what I envisioned, I envisioned the mashed potato to be smooth and creamy with chunks of lobster meat but we didn't get that so we only took a few bites of it.I said to myself, thank god we decided to share this side dish, otherwise it would have been such a waste.We had so much food left that the waitress suspected something was wrong.  She knew it was my birthday celebration and so she tried to coax us with some Smores for dessert.It was weird since I was curious about the dessert being a fan of Smores, but I am not a huge fan of overly sweet things. This dessert has caramel drizzle and I definitely am not a fan of caramel.The dessert was very rich, but it was actually the ONLY thing that was executed well.The manager here is freaking awesome - he deserves 5 STARS!The only thing that I LOVE from this night was the dessert wine.It's Moscato d'Asti Nivole by Michele Chiarlo.He ended up printing out two copies of places where we can find the wine in the city.If I was to ever come back to this place, it would be for the Manager, Waitstaff, and the Bartender exceptional service.  THEY ARE A-W-E-S-O-M-E!And so is T - thanks hunnie bunnie!",1,1,1,Ro R.,"Brooklyn, NY",83,2220,93

I've never been so happy with a meal and to top it off, smores bread pudding for dessert. I left Giorgio's full, happy and with a decent amount of money still in my pocket.  The staff was absolutely wonderful. Shawn (or Sean.. or Shaun) seated us and was a delight to talk to.

4.0,9/7/2009,"Another of my favourite and ever so-reliable places to dine at in the Flatiron area. Giorgio's of Gramercy is a real neighbourhood GEM. I am amazed at how reasonable their menu prices are in comparison to the quality of the food and portion sizes. Perfect for ""traditional flavour"" lovers. I am glad we scouted out this place for my dad, who doesn't fancy modern fusion or new-american food.   The ambiance is romantic and intimate, with dark red walls and candlelit tables. Although my little sister did comment it was like entering a bat cave, since we had to use the light from our table candles to inspect the menu. Depending on the night, the restaurant can get a little loud for a peaceful dinner. Nevertheless, you get great value for your money here. What i love is that you can order their pastas as a half-portion appetizer (only $9 to $11!), and portions are LARGE, especially if you order the pasta/risotto dishes as a starter. Dishes that I highly recommend are:- the spicy, duck risotto w/ chorizo- best risotto that i've had at any fine dining restaurant in NY and Singapore. When i dined here with my family, despite having different tastes in food, all of us loved it. - Moroccan lamb w/ cous cous and bok choy- Pasta Bolognese - as simply as it sounds, i loved the meaty richness of this dish. The desert selection is just OK, sizes are shareable by 2. Normally I go for the Smore bread pudding w/ vanilla ice-cream. It is a little sweet for my taste, but i'm sure it would satisfy most people. Expect a 3 course meal, including wine to amount to about 55-60 dollars a person.",1,0,1,Annabel A.,"New York, NY",47,161,0

4.0,7/19/2009,"I'm not exactly sure when it happened, but somewhere along the line I grew up and became a working man. (It seems like just yesterday, I was dodging a friend's vomit after we took one too many shots.*) So lately, my forays into Gramercy's food scene are limited to SeamlessWeb from the office. Although I was searching for one of the delivery staples (Mexican, Chinese, sushi, etc), Giorgio's caught my eye. I've been there for dinner, but not in years. As I perused the menu, I was struck by their pricing. $5.50 for a Caesar salad? Under $10 for most of the pastas? These are not Manhattan prices, especially for a place that I know serves delicious food. I opted for the farm chicken entree, served with smashed potatoes and broccoli rabe. It arrived a bit later than the SeamlessWeb estimate, but it was wonderful. A basic, well-executed roast chicken, potatoes and greens meal, this chicken is a steal at $14. The skin was crispy, and well-seasoned...I loved it.Giorgio's is high-quality Italian food at low-quality Italian food prices. This is good news for everyone.*Actually, I think that was yesterday.

3.0,4/20/2009,"Without Will (the manager) or the earth-shatteringly delicious mac & cheese, this meal would've been a disaster. A group of eight of us came to Giorgio's for a very special occasion and had planned ahead of time to personalize the prix-fixe menu a bit. They offered to add a half-order of mac & cheese to the list of possible appetizers, and to offer unlimited red AND white wine throughout our meal. Our first server, whose name we didn't even get, showed up once at the first half of our meal to say that they're swamped and that she'll take our orders later. After about 15-20 minutes of no service and really bad communication with our server, we finally asked for Will, who I'm envisioning now in a cape and tights, and he saved the day.On to more important matters: FOOD. The mac & cheese was phenomenal. The crusty crumble on top and the creamy gooeyness of the cheese was heaven in my mouth, and the truffle oil and whatever else went into it made this dish the highlight of the evening.The crab bisque with flash-fried soft shell crab wasn't too creamy, and I do prefer my bisque on the creamier side. My companions seemed to love it. I wasn't the biggest fan.The medium-rare filet mignon was a little overcooked, and the winter vegetables (a couple varieties of squash) were forgettable. The rare tuna was cooked medium-rare, and most everyone's entree meats were overcooked (probably due to the restaurant being ""swamped,"" right?). The s'more bread pudding dessert was great, and the trio of sorbets and gelatos were tasty and refreshing.All in all, a decent meal with a couple highlights and a really rough start.",2,1,2,Ina C.,"Boston, MA",377,698,93
3.0,4/18/2009,"Birthday dinner here for a guy and about twenty people. They seated us efficiently in the back, and beforehand, had arranged a price fixe menu (about $60/person + tax/tip) if we'd wanted, but we opted for the a la carte menu. There was a local dinner price fixe at $35, too, which wasn't bad. I ended up with the special striped bass on spinach and sweet black beans (good), with a side of grilled asparagus (some too dry).The appetizer was the shrimp cocktail - spicy, with half shrimps thrown into the sauce itself, as opposed to the single one on the rim. The salad with pears and walnuts was nice, not too heavily engorged with dressing, and the calamari was fried up nicely, although went better with the cocktail sauce than the sauce they gave. The raw oysters weren't bad, decent sized, but not quite melt-in-the-mouth yet.The other entrees - duck was good, soft and juicy, with a crispy skin. The steak was okay, although not as savory as expected. The chicken - skip it, it was fried up dry and was supposed to be grilled - not sure what happened there.  The sweet potatoes with mushrooms... not a great combination under the duck. Aside from that, the mashed potatoes with the chicken kept people from starving. Brussel sprouts.. a bit too cooked, they were very bitter.Plenty of soft bread and olive oil to start off before the meal. Service didn't take up all the breadcrumbs until after the entree, though, instead of before? Made for a messy table most of the meal.Desserts, we brought a cake, but someone got the price fixe dessert of the s'mores w/ice cream.... looked good. They had a nice selection of drinks, although no chardonnay that night, so they opted for some very interesting dark chocolate beer... strong, if nothing else.Inside, decor is dark and warm, looking to generate passion, but contrasting a bit with the bar and the staff. Generally responsive staff, and the bathrooms in the back were screened off by two heavy curtains, but otherwise clean.Not bad, but not the best.

Four huge scallops presented with a scoop of creamy polenta grilled on top to look like a huge scallop, with a sweet beet sauce, asparagus, and thick pieces of salty prosciutto to round out the flavors.

4.0,2/25/2009,"Ok, so this was restaurant week and we were told that the menu consisted of experimental dishes. Well, if what I had was the direction of the future, I'm definitely coming back. I started off with the arugula salad with prosciutto di Parma, fried and breaded goat cheese, pomegranate seeds, candied pecans with a citrus-balsamic glaze. Love all the ingredients but this was too much for one dish. Too many bold flavors, too many different textures, this would have made for a great two salads.The shrimp salad with avocados, cheese and asparagus was very light, refreshing and beautiful dish. Too bad I didn't order this...The seared duck was flavorful, tender and juicy. Oh, and the skin....so crispy, so flavorful; they should make duck skin bacon! However, I wasn't a fan of the sauce. It was sweet and I don't like sweets on my meats. Luckily I had removed the duck from the sauce and saved the dish. The grilled yams and asparagus were a nice touch, if not a bit heavy when paired with meat.And yet another winner, the Maine lobster linguini with rock shrimp and vodka sauce included a surprisingly bountiful amount of lobster and the pasta was cooked perfectly al dente. Vodka sauce is usually too creamy for my preference but they cooked it with fresh tomatoes. I thought this was genius as the acid from the tomatoes helped cut the cream and added a new dimension to the flavor.",2,0,2,Alex C.,"San Francisco, CA",108,168,243

4.0,10/31/2008,"My family was coming into the city for my birthday dinner a couple of weeks ago, and I was suffering from the usual stress over where to take this picky group...particularly my dad who is impossible to please. I knew it had to be somewhere with basic fare (nothing ethnic or too dressed up), and I wanted a place with a nice atmosphere. I checked out the website to get an idea of the ambience and menu, and found that it met my criteria. The Yelp consensus was that Giorgio's was great, so I decided to give it a try.After accidentally making a reservation for the day prior, and only finding out that I had done so when I called to add another person to my party, I thought the restaurant was going to kill me. Surprisingly, the maitre'd was nothing but affable and accomodating...so much so, that I'd say he significantly skewed my opinion of Giorgio's toward the positive.  The ambience upon arrival was not what I expected. The dining room is not hideous by any means, but I'll just say that the website posts one image that certainly portrays the space in a more flattering light. I was just not a fan of the dark red walls (poorly painted) and curtains hiding the entrance to the bathroom.Other than that, I very much enjoyed my meal. I wasn't sure how the rest of my group felt since no one ooh'd and ahh'd, but when I asked them a couple days later, they all gave quite positive reviews. Following my meal, the afforementioned maitre'd offered me a choice of an after-dinner drink or shot as my complimentary birthday present. He asked if my boyfriend was going home with me, and when I said yes, he insisted that my guy have a shot as well. I ordered tequila, and was served not Patron, but some new high-end Cuervo product that far surpassed any tequila I have ever had!

3.0,10/9/2008,"Giorgio's reminds me of going to a wedding....not in a good way.The food is fine, not great, not really well seasoned.The quality of the meats is not really restaurant grade.Whereas most of the staff seem to be really giving it their A game, they are not really ready for prime time...staff is running around aimlessly, really really trying but we had one course and it was almost 1.5 hour meal (and this is with one steak cooked medium rare, one salmon, and one scallops and early in the evening).Saving grace is it's not overpriced but really just a mediocre experience.  I am really shocked that people would give this place 5 stars....Yelpers, let's not overvalue our currency.",1,0,1,Craig P.,"New York, NY",37,87,0
4.0,9/30/2008,"I was completely satisfied with my meal at Giorgio's this afternoon.  The atmosphere was extremely cozy with leather booths and throw pillows.  The waiter my boyfriend and I had was soo nice.  He went out of his way to make us feel comfortable.  Service was very quick.  Our food was ready in about 15 minutes.  I ordered the rigatoni in spicy marinara sauce with eggplant and cubed fresh mozzarella.  I only ordered half a portion because I was saving room for the s'mores bread pudding that everyone was raving about.  The ingredients were fresh and delicious.  My only complaint is that the pasta could have been cooked a little longer, but then again, I love my pasta really soft.  I was in heaven as I devoured my dessert.  Although the bread pudding had a rich chocolate flavor, the caramel sauce and scoop of vanilla ice cream balanced it out.  As if the dessert wasn't delicious enough, it came with a homemade cinnamon graham cracker and little chocolate crunchies.  They reminded me of those crunchies in the Carvel birthday cakes, but 10 times better because they were not fake and processed.  My bf ordered the grilled pita w/ steak and roasted peppers.  The dish came with a huge portion of french fries, which were crisp to perfection.",0,0,0,Stephanie B.,"Brooklyn, NY",2,47,0
4.0,9/2/2008,"For a time now, I've been nurturing this liking for everything encapsuled in the ""Y"" sector of Gramercy nestled between Broadway & Park; I don't know if it's the gilded quality of the buildings, or something else, but I find myself returning to Craft, Flute, Lucy's, Gramercy Tavern, and as of late, Giorgio's of Gramercy.Giorgio's is that perfect dining spot of neutral quality; generic in it's romantic airs and ambience, but inviting to relaxation and long-talks with your friend or date.The Yellow squash risotto will be my first mention; with it's black truffle butter over parmesan cheese, it is the perfect appetizer if you are going to be ordering the NY Strip or the Duck Breast, as the truffle gist works great as a forerunner for the peppercorn sauce (on the strip) and the pear port wine (on the duck). You can also order all the appetizer platters as main courses for a bit more, in which case the Giorgio's Antipasto will do for starters.The Sorbet trio is a nice option for dessert, and for those with a more intrepid sweet tooth (and that couldn't care less about weight gaining) the S'more bread pudding will definitely fill you up (and perhaps beyond capacity) with it's graham cracker crust, choco-marshmellow and caramel taste. ""Sometimes diabetes is a worthy thing, capicce?"" -so Giorgio appears to say.All in all, a solid Italian option when wanting a romantic evening around this neighborhood, and you weren't able to make reservations on Craft, the Tavern or Pure Food & Wine. And before I forget, Giorgio also provides catering services and delivery ANYWHERE around Manhattan. Bellisimo vero?",7,6,9,Javier M.,"New York, NY",723,387,174
4.0,8/8/2008,"The food here is amazing. For appetizers, we started out with the buffalo mozzarella on top of sliced ciabatta with fig jam. This was absolutely delicious!! We also had two salads: spinach salad with nuts and parmesan and the beets salad with pears, etc. Both were excellent. There was a raw person in our group, and I'm so glad this restaurant offered things he could eat. The gazpacho is the best in the city. Normally I hate gazpacho because it just tastes like water with some tomato paste in there, but this gazpacho was so flavorful and full of chunky vegetables/herbs with avocado on top. My risotto was pretty cheesy and flavorful, but not too salty or too creamy. It was just right. My friend said the bucatini was so delicious, and he doesn't like eating pasta too much in the city. The service was a bit slow, but it was such a great place to have food and just sit and chat.  This could also have been a romantic place for a date if the lighting was slightly darker.",1,0,1,Bo B.,"New York, NY",490,984,753
4.0,7/8/2008,"Very romantic ambience and great for a date!   My friends from Italy & I get together once a month to eat at a different Italian restaurant in the city and we were very much pleased with this place & thought it very sophisticated yet nice & cozy Italian.  It's also conveniently located near Union Square.  I also liked how the restaurant is kind of tucked away on 21st St.  The service is with a more mature staff.Their Squash ravioli is very good and their Pork Chop is so well made with lots of unique culinary aspects to it that it was full of surprises.  The waiter overheard that it was my friend's birthday that he gave us a large gelato & cake dessert on him, which was nice since we didn't even ask him.",1,1,1,Ana L.,"CA, CA",10,38,1

5.0,6/2/2008,"I have to say that my New York vacation was made by Giorgio's of Grammercy.My friend Lauren lives two doors down from this charming Italian Bistro & it's pretty much like a second home to her.  The first evening of my trip we were walking down to the corner deli so I could grab a late night sandwich & she literally pounced on the Chef from GoG, who was standing cooling off on the sidewalk.That should have been an indication of how warmly & kindly I'd be welcomed into this establishment by the staff.  We had a drink (or four) at Giorgio's the next night before going to our poshy dinner... And, the following night we popped in for dinner & drinks.Each time I enjoyed conversation & truly exceptional service -- from the bartenders (Brian & Chris) to our server (Sophia) to the manager (James.)  Perhaps it was because I was with a regular; but, I watched them be just as hospitable to everyone who walked through the door.The menu is seasonal - mainly Italian.  I had the pan seared scallops with pearl onions & roasted corn coolies.  I also had calamari & artichoke hearts with a lemon dill dipping sauce.  TRES YUM.I asked James to pick a Pinot Noir for me (as I just wanted a glass or two, not a bottle) and he brought me a Le Crema -- what a great choice!  Shows me that the staff is very knowledgeable about food pairings & the various wine palates.  I said that I like reds, dark fruit, sweet, but dry... that's basically as good as saying La Crema.They regularly create vegetarian dishes for Lauren, though they don't have a great deal of strictly veggie options on the menu.  (Shows that the chef is inventive & concerned with the patron's experience.)Plus, they are extremely reasonable in price.   EXTREMELY.I cannot believe that someone hasn't reviewed this homey, charming little hole in the wall yet -- what a find -- thanks to all the GoG staff for making my vacation even more enjoyable!",7,5,7,Kate R.,"Los Angeles, CA",695,460,18
2.0,5/7/2008,I'm gonna give Giorgio's one star for food (terrible) and 1 star for service (excellent). I feel pretty bad saying that because they were totally nice to us but the kitchen is just not up to par. On the bright side the bar upfront is cozy and they have a generous happy hour (50% off pretty much everything) so I'd probably return for a drink and then eat elsewhere.,1,0,1,russell m.,"Brooklyn, NY",40,48,1
3.0,4/18/2008,"With baseball season here, allow me to begin this review with the following analogy, a good restaurant can be like your top pitcher or even your 2nd best pitcher - has great talent, and can execute consistently.  They know the strike zone and can hit their target with whatever they throw at you.  They may have their bad days, but they are successful at doing other things to make up for shortcomings when they happen.A bad restaurant is like a journeyman pitcher who isn't good enough to do well, but isn't bad enough to quit the game.   Maybe they have some talent and they can throw better than you or I can.  But in the end, they are serving up batting practice to hitters every time they pitch.Giorgio's is in the middle... it's like a middle reliever or 5th starter.   I'm sure it can be a good starting pitcher on some days, but in the end, without amazing food, it can't blow people away or leave people feeling overwhelmingly satisfied.After reading some of the previous reviews on this place, I was excited to take a group of friends here for a nice dinner on a Sunday night.   I was looking forward to having solid new american food with an Italian influence.   Unfortunately, the food failed to impress and our experience fell way short of matching any of the previous reviewers' descriptions.The bread, that was served was not very good. So that was a disappointing start to our meal.   It was soft, but pretty tasteless.  The olive oil didn't help make it any better.The calamari was decent.  Nothing spectacular.   My friends ordered some of the fish dishes, my girlfriend ordered the duck, i ordered the rack of lamb, and my cousin ordered the chicken.  I'd say my dish was by far the best of them all - the duck was bland, the chicken was a bit dry, and the fish dishes were mediocre.I really wanted to like this place.  I thought the service and the atmosphere would at the very least more than make up for the ok food, but in the end everything was just average.So, while our dinner wasn't a disaster, it was nothing spectacular...   a middle relief pitcher or #5 pitcher still trying to make it someday as a top starter.",1,0,1,Peter L.,"New York, NY",6,11,1

We also tried the mac and cheese (which I never get at a restaurant), and I thought it was excellent - not too cheesy with some bread crumbs on the top.For an entree, I tried the duck, which was great.  Very flavorful, but a little fatty.  My friends tried the scallops, trout, and rabbit.  They all had good things to say.Overall, a great restaurant.",1,0,0,Silvio D.,"New York, NY",9,278,21
5.0,2/3/2008,"Oh my gosh I LOOOOOOOOOVE Giorgio's. Heaven in my mouth. If I could give this place an infinite amount of stars, I would. I don't know if I can even put into words how much I love it... but for the sake of Yelp I will try!Came to NYC in '02 for NYE/Friend's 21st birthday. We stayed at the Marriott Marquis, did the whole times square thing, the works. We wanted to take our other friend who was ALSO having a birthday (on the 30th) out to a nice dinner, but had NO idea where to go. This was my first time in NYC so I was useless, and no one else had any idea. So... what do good tourist do? We ask our hotel maitre d' for a recommendation - and told him non-tourist place. He recommended Giorgio's and we all had the BEST food!!I have since gone here and taken people with me EVERY time I'm in NYC. I love it. If I were a New Yorker, I'd eat her ALL the time!! My mother HATES eating out and having to pay for what she feels she can make at home (she thinks her cooking is better than it really is, but that is neither here nor there). SHE LOVED GIORGIO'S. She went on and on about it after we left - how it was so yummy and delish and wasn't too pricey, and actually you got FAR better food than the cost would suggest.Moderate prices, $$ per person depends on if you just get an entree or if you do like I do and get 3 courses!You can get 1/2 size meals for some options too... so what I do is usually get an app, a 1/2 size meal, and then dessert. My fav I think is the Buffalo Mozzarella,  the Penne Ragu (a Veal Bolognese) and Baked Alaska.If you didn't know this place was here, you'd miss it. The outside is misleading (hole in the wall, kinda) but the inside decor is fun and fresh. I would recommend this place for dates, or smaller groups (it was a bit hard to fit our whole birthday group of 12 people). I would NOT bring a child here... even though I see people have voted ""good for kids"" - liars. I love children, and I can't wait to have my own. That being said...maybe it's just me, and maybe it's because I don't have kids yet (although I don't think my opinion is going to change)... when going out for a nice meal, leave your kids at home and hire a babysitter. If you're hitting up Fudruckers, bring the ankle-biters along... but not to nice sit down restaurants. I'm trying to enjoy my meal in peace w/o your child screaming in my ear.So if I haven't said enough already about how awesome this place is...IT'S AWESOME, GREAT, SUPER, FANTASTIC, WONDERFUL, DELICIOUS, AMAZING, MOUTH-WATERING GOODNESS!!!!!!!!!!",1,0,1,Jen H.,"Somerville, MA",432,564,100

4.0,11/16/2007,This is an especially great spot to take your parents.  The decor was very classy and elegant with a relaxed atmosphere.  Our server was especially friendly and sweet and very knowledgable of the menu.  It just so happens that on sundays its $15 off all bottles of wine!!   For our apps we had the littleneck clams (which were especially big) and the calamari.  Both tasted great.  My King Salmon was a bit average- however my father's Rack of Lamb was amazing.  It was cooked to perfection and had a gorgeous presentation.  My mom's scallops were especially yummy- and I don't even like scallops!  When it came to desserts-   the s'more bread pudding was so delish that I'll  never think of bread pudding the same way again.  My mom's Dark Chocolate-Almond Toffee Mousse was a bit much for me but I can see how this new addition to the dessert menu is among one of the favorites.   They even put a candle on it for my Mom's bday and when we got the check - they had comped our desserts.  Best service I ever received in a restaurant.  I'm looking forward to going back soon and trying some of the pasta dishes some other yelpers have been raving about.  This place seems like a great choice for any night of the week or any occassion.,2,0,1,Caroline L.,"NY, NY",21,35,11
5.0,6/14/2007,"July edit:Can I please give this place 6 stars? I've been back 3 times in less than a month.. and have tried almost all the main meat entrees on the menu. Nothing has disappointed me at all. On our third visit tonight, James, our waiter, recognized us and treated us like royalty.  I don't think I've ever tipped anyone 25% before (mostly because I never feel like restaurants have spectacular service).. but I was more than happy to round it up for him. He's awesome! I absolutely LOVE the service, and the food.. and I just wish I could give this place one more star. OH, do try their mac and cheese. Believe me. ++I'll admit it; I'm a selfish biatch. I almost didn't want to write a review for this place because I want to keep it all to myself, but in the good spirit of Yelping, I pushed away my selfish thoughts and decided to give Giorgio's the praise it SO deserves. Indeed a hidden gem, you'd hardly notice this place from the street. However, once you step in, you are greeted by a wonderful classy/modern-esque interior and a large wood bar. To the back is a great restaurant space which is great for groups (about 6-7). Good for a date, or a client dinner, or in my case, dinner with my parents and a client.. this place is versatile for any occasion. Now, the fun part - food talk. The meal started out with complimentary shrimp over baguette slices, along with bread and olive oil. Salads were simple but had the best ingredients. The dishes were awesome. Here are the ones I recommend most:- scallops: HUGE and SO tasty, served on a bed of beets. - lamb: Hearty and delicious when cooked medium rare to rare.- halibut: served on a bed of mushrooms, so damn good!- duck: juicy and tasty- pork: well seasoned and served with a very interesting sideAs for dessert, we got the creative S'mores bread pudding (I uploaded a picture). It was served with homemade whipped cream, caramel and little chocolate-malty balls (not a southpark reference, heh). One word: DIVINE. And how to tell that this place is truly da bomb? They end every meal with complimentary freshly-dipped chocolate coated strawberries. The baked alaska and cheesecake also deserve honorable mentions.All in, appetizers, entrees, a bottle of wine, a few coffees & teas, one dessert. 18% svc for a party of 6  = $240. Yeah.
