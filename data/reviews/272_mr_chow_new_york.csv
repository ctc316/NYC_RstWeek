5.0,4/10/2019,"Nice upscale and elegant Chinese restaurant. My first time going I thought it was gonna be really expensive, but it wasn't. Chows serve food for two or three people. The food was awesome I had duck and shrimp fried rice. They also offer you Fiji water instead of tap, that's the first time I ever experienced that from a restaurant, I was impressed! The staff there was very professional and attentive making our experience very easy going. Definitely will be back in the near future",0,0,0,Millennial E.,"Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",22,53,3
2.0,3/27/2019,"First the good news...all staff was very friendly. And unfortunately that's where it ends. Mediocre food, terrible service, seating horrible. First, the tables are so close together you are wedged into your seat and bumped by waiters or other eaters. The tables are squeezed together. Uncomfortable to look at and even more uncomfortable to sit at. There is a cast of 1000's ready to serve your food way to quickly...is it to get you out of there to turn the table over - that's what it felt like. We actually had to tell our waiter to ask the kitchen to slow it down. Before my fork was put down the next dish was presented. Food was truly average, nothing special and we were not wowed by any particular dish and we had several. Absolutely not worth the prices-so overpriced even for mid-town. I really wanted to like it and perhaps another location is better.",0,0,0,B. F.,"Caldwell, NJ",0,2,0
4.0,3/14/2019,"this place is wild. In an amusing and oddly good way. It seems that people come here for different reasons, but mostly because the people that dine here probably want really good chinese food and can afford the exorbitant prices. I came here for a business dinner and I would dare say the food is quite good. I would say stay within the ""safe"" dishes. This place is very 80's and we sat at the bar to start. The bar is very kitschy and the ONLY beer they had was tsingtao. Now for anyone that's dined at chinese restaraunts, they know that even the most run of the mill one has tsingtao. So it's kind of amusing. They also make a mean old fashioned. The bartender seems pretty good and attentive and I liked that he poured the rest of my beer into my collins glass. My only complaint is that for this price range, you expect the finest beverages as well. Tsingtao isn't the finest and neither is Fiji flat water. Don't get me wrong. Fiji is nice and a top 5 water probably, but for such a place, I would need some mountain valley spring water. something magical :) Food wise, portions are lacking and prices are through the roof but according to Mr. Chow in a NYT article, that is all intentional. I truly admire him for making good chinese food a true delicacy. If you want peking duck, it's $86 per person. So for 5 people, that's almost $450!!! and ONE duck. It is exceptionally good make no mistake. Everything here was actually tasty: fiery beef, quail lettuce cups, shumais, rice, and duck. I would say this place has a good mix of business meals and people that can afford the food and come for sentimental reasons. If you take someone here for a meal, you are sending a pretty strong message: have some good food and money is not an obstacle. You won't come away with any doggy bags here. They take the food away and you'll never see it again! ah, excess indeed.",2,1,2,Peter M.,"Fort Lee, NJ",270,414,887

1.0,2/17/2019,"I've been a loyal customer of Mr. Chows for the past 15 years, dining there at least twice a year.  Over the years the level of service has deteriorated to an all time low.  While dining there a few weeks ago my friends and I were sitting at a corner table in close proximity to the ""quasi champagne bar"".  I call it quasi because it's not a safe place to store and open jumbo bottles of champagne, as it's location is on a small table right next to the table where patrons are seated for dining.In the middle of our meal out of nowhere a HUGE, when I say HUGE, I mean GINORMOUS champagne bottle stopper flew from the ""champagne BAR"" and onto our table, whizzing right by my friends face and landing directly into her plate.  The service person responsible for this quickly glanced at our table saw that my friend was not hit, Kanye shoulder shrugged ‍, came over retrieved the stopper and DID NOT APOLOGIZE.  He went right back to serving the champagne bar.  We called over our waiter, explained the situation and he was apologetic, but as he was not witness to the incident there was only so much that he could do.  We asked to see the manager.  We wanted to bring to the managers attention how dangerous this was and how the outcome could have differed if my friend was hit with the stopper.  The Maitre'd - Csabi Szekely was extremely dismissive.  He said, ""well was she hit""? We replied ""No"" he then said ""well what do you want then""?  I'm sorry but this is not the type of response that is acceptable from a maitre'd of a 4 star restaurant, with global locations.  Instead of being dismissive, a good manager would have apologized and offered a resolution such as moving the ""champagne bar"" to a location further away from the patrons and offered our tables some kind of gratuity.  He did none of the above. The purpose of my review is to bring attention to this situation where customers are put in harms way and the lack of response by poor management.  Mr. Chows I expect better and your customers deserve better than Csabi Szekely.",2,0,0,S W.,"New York, NY",48,4,3

1.0,2/9/2019,Known for their exceptional service. If you order the restaurant week special - they treat you completely different.

3.0,2/2/2019,"I'm sad to say it, but my experience at this acclaimed New York staple was really mediocre at best. We came here for restaurant week last night and got a tasting menu with what was supposed to be a smattering ""the best items on the menu"". The dishes were incredibly average, very salty and nothing more interesting then one would fine at your local chinese takeout. The truth is the food was good but nothing special and certainly not worth the price tag that is generally charged for what is supposed to be a high-end culinary experience. The service was good, as to be expected for a fine dining restaurant. The atmosphere was somewhat iconic, but simultaneously the flagrant overuse of black lacquer and Lalique crystal also made it feel like 1980s Park Avenue apartment interior seriously in need of an update.",0,0,0,Kimberly S.,"Los Angeles, CA",273,17,8
3.0,1/20/2019,"The service at Mr Chow is truly impeccable from the moment you walk in. However, i'm not sure what some people rave about when it comes to food. After being seated, the waiters graciously didn't sit anyone directly next to us which i really appreciates. the tables have lighting on them so you can read the menu more clearly, however the chairs are extremely uncomfortable and outdated. No man would enjoy sitting in that chair, it needs to be changed and the rest of the restaurant needs a flip too. The 80s look should be kissed goodbye. I had the chicken satay which was really good and the pot stickers were the highlight of the night, i should've had 10 orders of those and called it a night. When it came to main dinner, the portions were typical manhattan (super small) and untynately not impressive. the drunken fish which was supposed to be drunk with wine tasted like honey syrup and overpowered any appetite i had left. the four color cauliflower was dyed different colors but tasted good/plain, and the crispy beef didn't really have any beef in it and was very oily. Overall i wasn't impressed and i was hoping the reviews weren't legit but they are.",3,0,1,Melanie D.,"Queens, NY",263,534,335

Waited five minutes before we were seated. This place has a full bar so they make whatever you want. Great. The dishes are prepared family style so you can share with 2,3,4 people. Great.  The Highs...   Mr Chow Noodles.  Good taste with the sauce provided.  Fried Shrimp... they fry it with the scale on so you will need to remove that before eating otherwise this would have been good.  Spare Ribs....BLAND with a capital B.   Entree's...  Filet Mignon was decent.  Beijing Chicken was good with fried Rice but honestly you can get something just as good at a carry-out. Now onto the ""star"" of the night.  The Lobster.   Smothered into this delicious butter and garlic sauce was a rubbery tough piece of seafood.  Very disappointing.  We ended up paying $84 a plate plus tips for very mediocre food.  In the end, it was not worth it.   The waiting staff however deserves every single cent.   Too bad they have to serve one star food.",0,0,0,Kent B.,"Springfield, OH",17,25,22

1.0,4/2/2018,"The bad reviews are onto something: bad service, bad pricing, tacky decor, and my own peeve, poor indoor temperature control (I thought it was a restaurant, not a furnace.) And they sync up with what high-profile restaurant critics have been ""calling out"" for a decade: a place running on fumes, Conde Naste-fueled hype, and Elaine's-type celebrity halo that masks mediocre food and poor P2P (price to portions ratio). In my view, this is the most contemptible restaurant in NYC.Let's start with the price gouging. Look out before you order, unless you want to get stuck with a $25 bill for ginger ale and a glass of red wine! Next: Mr. Chow has slyly inserted a 3-person minimum for 'signature' dishes like the Peking duck. That means if you come here with just another person -- pretty typical formation that dines out, I'd say -- you can either pay an extra $80 or they'll refuse to serve it to you. You can't get it a la carte, either, as a dish outside of a course structure. I'm sorry, but there's no way you can charge $200+ for a duck for 2 people unless you're using that windfall to counteract revenue loss. (You can show up on a Saturday night with no reservation and zero trouble getting in.)Chow himself is really obnoxious. He namedrops celebrities incessantly in interviews, and it's always of western actors and politicos. Let's not mention the western art or the non-POC wait staff that Chow has bragged about in interviews. There's a big debate now in dining culture over 'cultural appropriation,' but we ought to talk about the Fanonian inverse of that: when the colonized tries to imitate the colonizer. Chow spends more time social climbing onto museum boards and municipal elites of the sort that Mike Davis lambastes in City of Quartz (Eli Broad etc.) than working on his food.With places like Peking Duck House, Hakkasan, the RedFarm chain, Blue Ribbon, Decoy, and so many other options for good crispy duck, why bother?

For appetizers we had the spare ribs which was very tender. We also had the lettuce wrap which were pretty good too. For the mains- Beijing chicken. This was a little on the salty side but still tasted pretty good. However the highlight for me here was the green prawns which was delicious.

Luckily I was able to visit during Restaurant Week and see what it was like for myself!Impeccable service, from the super friendly hostess, the attentive FOH manager, and servers who were quick & nice without ever making us feel rushed. All of the stars are dedicated to them, lol!We had a reservation for 7 but the place was packed, so we waited about 20 minutes for our table for 2. In the meantime we got Lychee Bellinis at the bar which I HIGHLY suggest! So yummy.The famous noodles were good, but tasted 10x better with the hot sauce they brought to the table. We also got the satay, which i cant quite put into words because it was a strange taste. It tasted like oil cream sauce on fried chicken skewers.To be quite honest I cant remember much from the main course because it was all bland and not memorable. Not that it tasted ""bad"", per se, but i've had better takeout in Brooklyn or the East village. One thing that really bothered me was the proximity of the tables. Literally maybe 2-4 inches between each one, and the entire table has to be pulled out for each guest when they're trying to get up. Clearly Mr Chow is doing something right if they're coming up on 50 years but the set-up of the restaurant is not conducive to a packed house.I would absolutely, positively never in my life pay the full price of the food I ate tonight.

I mean, I was just expecting more...hence the 3 stars.The selection was nicely displayed but there was no ""wow"" factor. I mean, it was just OK, I guess I was expecting more. Is that fair to say? Had an array of: chicken satay (that was decent) , rice (was OK), veggies (again ok), and blueberry ice-cream (total hit!)Also, this place is small. I mean it's probably not really small, just that they have crammed in so many tables to accommodate guests but then you're basically right next to the other group. Umm...no thanks!

4.0,12/21/2017,"Mr Chow is not your neighborhood dumpling slinger. It is an old school, refined Chinese restaurant where the waiters wear white jackets and the food is served on large silver (or perhaps a less precious metal) platters. The ambiance is pretty midtown corporate and a bit stuffy, but the food doesn't miss.I ordered a margarita to begin the meal. It was god awful, but I take the blame and, as such, shall not factor the item into my scoring algorithm. I should not have, and will not again, order such a drink from an Asian restaurant. We sampled a large swath of the menu: chicken satay, dumplings, squab lettuce wraps, crispy beef, Kung pow chicken, string beans, some curious green squiggles determined after the fact to be a form of prawn, fried rice, and I'm sure a few more. The can't miss items were the chicken satay, lettuce wraps, and Kung pow chicken. All would have been nominated for a Tony if those were given out for Chinese dishes rather than Broadway shows. The can miss items were the dumplings, shrimps, and fried rice. After this plentiful bounty of food, we were presented with some sorbet swimming in champagne, which cleansed our pallets. We then took on the peeking duck. Dead from at least the moment it landed on our table, I doubt this bird of espionage saw much. But if it had taken a look around, it would have noted some very happy customers.",1,0,1,Oliver S.,"Manhattan, NY",6,118,1

The restaurant is small and I felt as through everyone is sitting on top of each other.. so much to the point that I did not get up to even use the bathroom because I was afraid that I wound bump people on the way there. Our waiter was really nice as soon as I sat down I asked for the lychee martini because I heard it's a popular drink there but he recommended that I try the lychee Bellini and it was AMAZING !!!! We also ordered the pot stickers and chicken satay (also very popular ) the pot stickers are to die for but the chicken satay was bland in my opinion. For our main. Course our waiter recommended that we go with the prie fix because it would come with rice and two entrees. We ordered the Beijing chicken and the spicy chili pork (I believe that's the name) the rice was ok but I tasted like white rice with Lima beans and eggs nothing spectacular in my opinion. In between dinner someone was at the top of the stairs and had a little show not to sure that he was doing is called but the end result it seemed at tho it was noodles .I ordered a lychee martini just to try and it wasn't good I sent it back and asked for another Bellini they also gave me dessert on the house for my birthday,0,0,1,Jessica A.,"Jamaica, NY",60,28,82

Ok, I guess I need to say this again. Dear waiter, that is RUDE!!! Do you open your birthday cards to look for a check/gift card first too?  Bad form.  Management, please take note and have a talk with your staff.  Not acceptable. After bill: I'm stuck in my seat and can't get out because the tables are inches away from each other.  Eventually, about 10 minutes later, I could finally flag someone down to let me out.

My mother used to dine there quite often back in her day and was excited and nostalgic to go back. FIrst of all, the food was bland. This is the first time I've ordered Scallops and not been happy. They were unusually chewy and simply NOT good. Then I had the King Crab and was unhappy as well, but that was more of a subjective matter of personal taste. Up until then our waiters had both been courteous and professional.Then I got up to go to the bathroom and when I came back, my girlfriend informed me that the waiter had put his hand on her, and whispered in her ear that she was ""A very sexy woman"". Not wanting to cause a scene, I took the waiter to a corner of the restaurant to discuss the situation, eventually bringing him back to our table to apologize to my girlfriend, which he did falteringly. He then brought us two complimentary dessert dishes to make up for his scandalous behavior, but the damage had been done, and the evening ruined.

It was just me and a date. We ordered the filet mignon and the chicken Juana and the chicken satay. We did the 70 per person deal which is each person can get a main entree and share two sides. The bill came out to 210. I was very disappointed because the food was horrible. I'm a foody I love to eat and I grew up in Brooklyn so I know good Chinese. The food lacked flavoring. I wouldn't recommend this restaurant at all. They're in dire need of a new chef. im always hearing this restaurant in jay z songs. Lol I guess that's why I went. Total waste of money.

5.0,4/16/2017,"My review will be biased given that this is my favorite restaurant in the city (given all of the memories I have here). I have been coming here for many years, and yes even though it is EXTREMELY pricey- the food, service, decor definitely make it worth it (you just need to be mentally-prepared to drop some serious dough). For drinks: getting a bottle of wine is definitely the smartest choice as it will help reduce the cost BUT the lychee Bellini is my favorite cocktail! For appetizers: definitely get the chicken satay as they are super. They always bring one for each person in the table, so if someone is a vegetarian etc. ask to only get X amount. My mom- who does not like peanut sauce LOVES them- so you get an idea of how good they are. The pork water dumplings AND soup dumplings are also amazing! If you like spicy food, add the spicy sauce they have for a kick!!! The soup dumplings are also perfect size to take them all in, just make sure you let it sit for a few minutes. The crispy duck with the wrap is SO GOOD. Not too fatty, lightly breaded, and with a delicious sweet sauce on the side which you can control how much to pour. The seven spiced shrimp is also a favorite of mine but get rice or something bland to counterattack how spicy it can be! Although the sweet sauce it comes with also helps. The velvet chicken is also really good, and comes with veggies so definitely healthy but so yummy and flavorful! For dessert, they always bring complimentary fruits but the lemon tart and coconut sorbet are my favorite! If you like art, the walls have Keith Harrings and Basquiats.

3.0,6/18/2016,"Food was better than I expected based on what the reviews I read. With that said, it certainly was not a little over $200 meal (for 2 incl tip and 1 glass of wine each). We chose the Mr. Chow price fixed meal. We ordered the Walnut Shrimp & Me. Chow Noodle (fresh noodles with ground pork ragu) apps. The walnut shrimp was the best thing out of all the food. The noodles were pretty good despite the reviews I read. We ordered the Fiery Beef (chunks of filet mignon in a sweet sauce and Sea Bass which had absolutely no taste. The steak was good but I think I've had better similar beef dishes for half of what it cost there. We chose shrimp fried rice which barely had any shrimp and the shrimp that was in the rice didn't have much flavor. The rice though was pretty light for fried rice which overall was very good. The Bok Choy we chose for our vegetables was good but nothing special. The place was a lot smaller than I expected (57th street location). We had 6:00 reservations which I think is when they open. We ran a few mins late and there were 3 other tables seated on a Friday night. The ambience was okay but not what you would expect at a restaurant you will spend approx $85 all in per person without drinks.

3.0,2/18/2016,"IN SHORT: A splendid fantasia of Chinese food and glamour.THE STORY: Mr. Chow is not your ordinary Chinese restaurant. Indeed, the eponymous chef Michael Chow opened the restaurant on East 57th Street in 1979 believing that there was an opportunity to redefine Chinese cuisine by serving it in a dramatic, elegant setting that had previously been reserved for the less exotic canons of the French and the Italians.This is Chinese food without the take-out boxes, without the orange chicken, without the greasy clumps of chow mein. This is Chinese food that is presented with hyperbolic splendor, swollen prices, and a stateliness that has yet to be rivaled in the cuisine. This is Chinese food that is extraordinary, simply because it has been declared to be.But there is one question for which Mr. Chow must do some soul searching to find the answer: can the food possibly live up to the incredible expectations its elegant setting has created? And at the end of the day, does it matter if it doesn't?Indeed, the restaurant is so formal and fabulous that it's easy to forget Chinese food is on the menu until you settle down to order. But when service does finally come around in the clubby, sunken dining room with walls of antique mirrors, there are a few classic dishes not to be missed.Chicken satay is an original favorite with an appealing dose of spice, though its tenderness is the result of an exceptionally ethereal and buttery sauce, rather than some technically proficient execution. The Green Prawns, bright and colorful after a spinach ""bath,"" have a sweet yet earthy bite, and almost seem to pop with a burst of flavor.A recent preparation of beef with shepherd's purse, however, suffered from an excess of oil and clumpy fats that rendered the herbal elements of the dish virtually invisible. In fact, many of the flaws found in the dishes coming from Mr. Chow's kitchen can be attributed to this over-reliance on fats and oils, and a neglect of salt and heat.Perhaps most indicative of the strained balance between the buzzy showmanship of the restaurant and the food coming out of it are Mr. Chow's noodles, prepared daily in the middle of service to an adoring crowd. As the chef whips the noodles back and forth, guests think they're getting something truly authentic in this lustrous, fabulously decorated bubble, but when the noodles arrive in a pile of thick sauce, they are limp, mushy, and profoundly flavorless. It would be a tragedy at any other restaurant, but at Mr. Chow, it's swept under the rug of everyone's combined glamour. After all, if you have to ask if the food is actually good, you clearly aren't in the know.How much longer can guests leave the restaurant without questioning the quality of their high-priced meal, instead simply basking in the sumptuous splendor of the dining room, that one excellent shrimp dish, and the impressive, dazzling wine? Well, Mr. Chow has been entertaining his starry clientele for nearly 40 years now, so perhaps he doesn't even know.",3,2,1,Ali M.,"New York, NY",31,234,245
3.0,2/8/2016,"Mr. Chows came off to me a bit overrated to me. The food was good, the experience was great but was it worth it?.. ehh. As a birthday dinner for my aunt we had a prefix menu of our own selected appetizers and entrees for the table to share; basically everything was family style. The quality of the food was good but I wasn't blown away like I hoped to be. The drinks were expensive, $18 for a Bellini and while it was good and this is Mr. Chows in midtown (I get it..), it's slightly excessive. Water was offered with 2 options to my knowledge- bottled or sparkling. We choose bottled and received Fiji priced @ $10/liter. Yes that's the same size that's 2 for $3 at Duane Reade on the corner... Go figure.At the end of the night for a party of 6 we had a $700 tab. Now while price isn't a concern, when debating on whether the experience was worth it even for a birthday- I say no. I feel the food should trump all and I wasn't blown away here. The ambiance was nice, the decor was beautiful and the staff knowledgable and attentive , however with no one having any real libations and mediocre fare Mr. Chows didn't have the ""wow factor"" I was hoping for.",2,0,0,Justin H.,"Bedford Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, NY",66,91,224

1.0,9/8/2015,"I don't understand how the doors stay open. The food is just outright bad.  Nasty, greasy and soggy. It is comparable to a take out joint in a Jersey strip mall, and not even a good one. Plus the portions are really small. As in you will need something else to eat on the way home. The arrogant service doesn't help.  If a neurosurgeon, war hero, noted writer or other sufficiently accomplished person talked down to me, I might be a little unnerved by that. But it a waiter in the worst restaurant in NY wants to talk down to me, although somewhat bemusing, it's still not acceptable. Finally, all of this might make sense of it were a cheap lunch counter. But no. The prices are outrageous. Forget about being able to get a good meal somewhere else cheaper, but you could likely go to Daniel or River Cafe or some other serious restaurant that serves amazing food for either the same price or not substantially more. There is literally nothing good about it.  Terrible food. Horrendous service.  High prices with absolutely no justification. Laughable decor. Also, if anyone is interested, here is how to get the Mr Chow experience at home. 1.  Order the worst, lowest-end Chinese take-out that seamless will deliver to you, and when it arrives, throw half of it out in order to get the portion size right. 2. Get some mid range wine. 3. Light $150 on fire. and 4. Ask a friend to insult you. You probably deserve it, particularly if you have paid for the Mr Chow experience.",3,2,0,D C.,"New York, NY",0,54,0

I have had FAR BETTER chinese food in hole in the walls in chinatown and even at the chinese fusion take out restaurants in Long Island. I am not sure how this place still has a crowd but based on what i assessed from the dining room this is an old timers place this restaurant is resting its laurels - on a scene rather than the quality in food, for if it was ever good, those frequenting have terribly unrefined palettes or just deal with the lack of quality in food due to the scene they are looking for.  Ambiance: I felt like i was walking into a time warp it looked like some seriously dated catering halls i went to for bar mitzvahs in LI or a bad 70's movie I cant decide all in all though it- felt like a place where the wealthy people would go eat before they went to the disco.

(I digressed) our bill totalled $617.So, our table went for the prefix menu which gave us four appetizer selections and four entrees accompanied with jasmine rice (with edamame) and a vegetable (sauteed string beans) that would serve six. For appetizer, we orderedbutterflied salt and peppered shrimp--seasoned really well I just wish  they removed the outer shellpork spare ribs--tenderMr. Chow Noodles--an interesting dish the looked like spaghetti with a dark red meat sauce but taste pretty good.The servings were just enough for us to be prepared for our entrees.Crispy beef--sugary sweet batter but couldnt distinguish that I was eating beefGinger (?) lamb--VERY tasty dish and did not taste game-like at allSauteed Chicken--one of the best dishes followed by the porkSpicy Pork--yes, the spices were present and this dish was yummy.Mr. Chow was a nice dining experience and the service was perfect however, if my bill is to total $600+ it has to include a good WINE and dessert.

1.0,3/14/2015,"STOP!!! Do not go to the restaurant!!! This place is a joke in so many ways. Because of a recent write-up of three A list celebrities having dinner at Mr. Chows I decided to try them out even though they had so many bad reviews.First I booked on Open table requesting a 6PM reservation for the same day. To my surprise they had openings every 30 minutes. So you may say this place must be huge, but they could only seat about 30 - 40 people maximum shoulder to shoulder.When we arrived the place was empty they seated which should have been a warning.Now let's count the ways why this place is a joke.Joke #1: No one on staff is Asian instead the entire staff except for the Nazi greeter was on a work release program from a Mexican prison.Joke #2: They don't serve Asian food in Mr. Chow. Their food is more closely related to Mexico but dressed to look like Asian cuisine. One of the dishes we ordered looked like lobster Pad Thai but was so spicy hot you could only taste pepper and there was no lobster.Joke #3 I am 100% sure the chef is from Mexico because of the spiciness and the only sauce they give you belongs on a taco.Joke #4 Food servings are children portions.Joke #5 Shrimp Roll costs $36 dollars. Keep in mind it this Shrimp roll you would buy for $2.25 in any Chinese takeout in NYC.Joke #6 My bill arrives and I was happy because I felt as tortured on Jesus in the Passion of Chris at this point and it was almost over. But, it was not because the next morning while reviewing my receipts against my online statement I saw they charged me $358 for someone else bill then credited me $358. Then charged my for my bill without the waiters tips. Yes I tipped him because it was not his fault that worked for Mr Chow. But, what annoys me is no one told me what happened I discovered this the next morning. So you may think I was complaining all night. Well we didn't say a word at all. In fact I was not even going to write this review until I saw this credit card mess.So to some this up DON'T GO TO MR CHOWS AT ALL. In fact don't even walk in front of the building, just cross the street and thank god that I took the time to write this review. If you want Asian food go to TAO for table serves or Gold Wok on 21 and 8 for takeout.Ok I am done ranting and I feel much better now.Love and Kisses",1,2,0,Tore E.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,1,0

Once my friends arrived, we were seated at a round table and served water.  Alejandro wanted the Peking Duck and so we had to order the prix fixe menu for $75 a person to be allowed to get that.  We ordered dumplings, the squid ink pasta, the handpulled noodles and the spare ribs as our four starters.  For the three mains, we got spicy pork, the filet mignon, and the drunken fish.  We were offered green beans as a vegetable and shrimp fried rice as well.  The ribs and the squid ink pasta were my favorites of the starters.  The hand pulled noodles were disappointingly bland and uncreative.  As for the mains, I liked the filet and the pork.  The duck finally arrived and it is definitely the piece de resistance.  The fat is completely rendered and the skin is crisp and laquered.  We were quite full by this time, but we applied ourselves and were able to eat some more. I cannot, however, get myself to justify $125 a person with 1-2 drinks each for dinner at a Chinese restaurant.

I can honestly say none of the food had any flavor. We received some vegetables on the side that basically had been kept in a boiling pot and were extremely slimy. This food has no representation of ""Asian"" food and I had to douse spicy sauce all over it to give it flavor. At this point, I can't believe a restaurant like this exists with its terrible overpriced food and no customer service. The dessert, some disgusting grocery store cake was cheap looking and tasting.

Not only did the food taste bad, but the presentation was   very unappetizing. The waiter brought out these small dishes on these gold colored platters. It was comical.

The upselling is intense and non-stop. You WILL NOT be able to order what you think you want.

This, however, would have been a very forgivable offense if what happened when the check came hadn't happened.We had been very specific from the very beginning that we didn't want to order the prix fixe menu, and were ordering a la carte instead. When the check came, our total reflected that we each had ordered the $67 prix fixe when in fact we had ordered 4 appetizers and three main dishes (even if we had ordered prix fixe, this would have been the $58 per person option.) When this was pointed out to the waiter, he argued with us for about twenty minutes. All we had asked him to do was print out the added total of each item we had ordered--what pretty much every restaurant does. When he finally did it, the total was about $80 less than what the prix fixe would have been. To top this all off, we had asked to speak to the manager who never came to apologize or even explain why we were charged what we were charged.

I went tonight with a group of 6 for dinner at 7:00 (with a reservation).  From the moment we sat down we were being hurried out the door.  Each of us ordered a full, four course meal, and were basically wrestling with the waiters to keep them from taking the plates away before we were done.  All six of us ordered drinks, appetizers, entrees and desserts.  None of us were allowed to finish any of it.  The final blow was when the hostess allowed a guest who was waiting for a table to come over and ask us how much longer we would be.  We paid and left before 8:30.  Not an unreasonable amount of time for six people to have drinks and eat three courses.  You would be much better off going to your neighborhood Chinese restaurant to enjoy some time with friends.  This location is perfect if you want to spend a lot of money to be treated like someone who is inconveniencing everyone who is supposed to be ensuring you have a good time.",9,4,1,Caroline B.,"ASTORIA, NY",1,5,0

Black and gold decore with carpeting upstairs overlooking the mirrored downstairs dining area feels strangely chic and retro, or just odd at the same time. They used to not bring you menus in order to jam your table with about 15 dishes too many. Nowadays you're able to get a menu (which includes prices) and order a la carte. As dated as it is, somehow they've managed to stay in business, and in fact thrive - probably on the kitch factor. They keep on opening up new locations, I don't get it!  At this location you almost expect to see the women walk in with huge shoulder pads or see some sort of Tony Montana showdown while the noodle guy is pounding away at the top of the stairs.

And then sat in the middle of the dining room where all the action was. Some strange matches of couples that evening. But none of my business. I'm a foodie and wino. Just loving the service & food. The seaweed salad was definitely something I had never tasted. Crispy flavorful almost like fried kale nt chips but crunchy.

Our friends made the reservations and were really excited about it, so I will be too.It's very tiny inside. They had to literally pull our the table so people could sit down. Once seated we had no less than 4 servers working our table which was a little confusing. Once we figured out the menu and ordered, then the magic happened.We got prix fixe for 4 with their Beijing duck. We didn't know what to expect. One after another our appetizers came out. They were all delicious. Once finished, a waiter cleared our table and set out fingerbowls for mid-meal cleansing. Then our entrees arrived. Not everything at once, and since we were all sharing, this was perfect. We never felt stuffed, only satisfied. Then came the duck. Oh, the DUCK! Duck is tricky, but they nailed it.While eating our entrees, I kept saying 'We need to save room for the duck'. Our friend assured me it would only be about 2 pieces of duck per person. No, it was a whole duck. There was easily 20 pieces there per person! They serve it with a little sauce, a thin pancake, and some julienne cucumber and scallions.

Not good. Two out of the four wine glasses on the table were dirty and one fork had dried food stuck to it - yuck.  The food is not the same quality.  They used to serve a diced quail or squab with butter lettuce for cups and plum sauce alongside.  Now it's diced chicken and the lettuce is iceberg. The chicken satay is a weird bright orange and the peanut sauce doesn't taste like peanuts, just like cream.  The beef course used to be filet mignon, now is some kind of strip steak (New York?) and was well done and dry.  They practically throw the plates on the table, 3 at a time, no spacing out of the dishes, with a rushed and muttered explanation of what it is.  The place was packed though - I don't get it.",0,0,0,Monique V.,"San Anselmo, CA",0,9,0

The food is simply bad. its probably one of the worst chinese/fusion restaurants ive been to in nyc, and one of the most expensive. Who cares about the decor and svc (which isnt that great)when the food is so miserable? Out of 6 dishes, the only one worth noting was the honey glazed prawns which was good at best. The squab appetizer is comparable to poor quality street meat, way over salted ($19) and fills 3-4 iceberg lettuce wraps. The $44 fillet was a dry flavorless cut of meat (definitely not prime) that only had taste from the over peppered edges and some odd sweet sauce they dribbled on it. The duck, which barely made 3 wraps was gross. It was way over fried, extremely dry, and annoyingly served like it was smashed onto the plate with all bones intact, making it difficult to get edible pieces.   I could go on, but feel I've wasted enough time and money on this place already. We were also coerced into the $67 prix fixe per person which was not worth it, we should have ordered individually as it turned out more expensive. If you want decent Asian fusion and fun atmosphere, you should try buddakan, Tao, Asia de Cuba, or Spice Market, as they all blow Mr. Chows away on price, food, and atmosphere.",3,0,0,Ricky R.,"Manhattan, NY",0,9,0
1.0,7/29/2013,"The fact that this place still exists blows my mind--it's very apparent that this place is a tacky relic from the 80s/early90s where people did not care about money or taste. I think it's offensive that this place is even considered Chinese food, but again, maybe in the 80s this was what Chinese food was. My latest visit happened to be during Restaurant Week which really allowed for Mr. Chow's overpriced, overhyped, overMSG'd and strange colors to shine:The ambiance--The decor is a prime example of 80s glitz, I actually like it. The crowd is a prime example of bridge and tunnel.The service--Since we did the Restaurant Week meals, they snatched up our menus and the appetizers were on the table 2 minutes later. We were done with dessert about 40 minutes later. We weren't asked for drinks after they took our menus, all they wanted to know was if they could clear our plates. The times I have come not on restaurant week, the service is always a bit off as well. You either get the guy that doesn't know anything or a guy that has all the lines, a real smooth talker, that tries to upsell everything.The food--Shrimp Roll is an unseasoned shrimp wrapped inside cardboard-like filo dough. Squab lettuce wrap is a mix of indecipherable soft foodstuffs on a piece of lettuce that has all the flavor of a luke warm glass of water. Mr. Chow Noodles are mushy noodles served with cat food. Chicken satay is that dish that everyone says you have to get, but it has almost zero relation to real chicken satay, except that its on a stick and is purportedly chicken. Also, isn't satay an Indonesian or Thai dish? No peanuts, no spice. The chicken is also bright orange for no apparent reason with a translucent slimy brown sauce. Beijing Chicken was an entree so sweet and slimy, only four bites were taken out of our table of four. Pork with sweet potato was just as sweet and slimy as the Beijing Chicken, but they hid pork belly in the MSG swamp, so I had to get me some. Unfortunately the pork belly had zero contrasting textures, which is to say, it was just really fatty and gross. Green Prawns are another notorious dish of Mr. Chows, and just like the Satay, it's absolutely mind boggling why. The prawns are bright green and in a warm, clear goo that has a faint spice to it. It's almost like eating gigantic boogers. Beef with Oyster Sauce tasted like someone went to a run-of-the-mill chinese delivery joint, ordered the beef and broccoli dish, picked out all the broccoli, ate the beef and vomited that on a plate that Mr. Chow serves up nice and tepid. Dessert was 2 scoops of vanilla ice cream and 2 scoops of berry sorbet for our table of 4, impressive.Price--The bill came to $160 for all that nonsense. It was one of those dinners, we're I actually wanted to go out to eat after--and the portions were huge! It was just too slimy and too sweet to get down.Bottom line is don't go here or to the one downtown or in ""Cali"" or to any of Mr. Chow's Philippes EVER. I don't care if it's restaurant week (actually, especially if it is), or if your company is paying, or it's just for lunch, or whatever other BS excuse. This needs to stop.

The noodles were as good as noodles can be. Both dishes came within 5 minutes of us ordering which I suspect is because they were cooked a while ago and they came Luke warm. For my entree, I had the drunken fish and I thought it was different and good. My fiancée disagreed and didn't like it.

We had:-Appetizers: Mr. Chow (vegetarian) Noodles, Squab Lettuce Wraps-Main Course:  He had a great chicken with mixed veggies dish and I had the Drunken Fish (sole in white wine sauce)-Desert: Vanilla ice cream, raspberry sorbet with kiwi and pineapple. This was a lot of food, we sure left full but not feeling overwhelmed.  It was great.  Decor/Ambiance:  Very simple, Gotham NY type of feel...high ceilings, rounded wooden chairs, mirrors...elegant and just really simple.  In the middle of the room there is a LARGER than Life floral bouquet that smells like Bora Bora. :) Staff:  So sweet...so nice, so quick, helpful and personable. The only CON that I have about this place and a tip for the owners, take out one or two single tables along the wall.  Our table was exactly one inch from the people next to us.  Needless to say we heard everything that they were talking about (which is natural) but when they got up to leave, they had to pull the entire table out in order to get out.  You guys make enough money, have steady clientele that you could afford to lose two tables in the back to have a little more room for your customers.  PLUS it is supposed to be one of those old school exclusive feel type of restaurants, when you pack in the tables like that, you lose a little of that feel.",3,0,0,R L.,"New York, NY",153,462,19

Everything feels pretty light, and nothing is ever greasy in a bad way. I also had the best goddamn $40 bellini I have ever bought here... well, the only $40 bellini I've ever bought. But this changes nothing... I still dream about it. Look, I'm gonna level with you- if you want amazing Chinese food the best bet is to just go to Chinatown. Mr Chow is far too expensive and just not amazing enough for me to justify going there at full price... that said, this was a fun experience and it was certainly a great Restaurant Week deal.",1,4,0,Jenna I.,"Brooklyn, NY",103,268,67

1.0,12/8/2012,"This is where good taste goes to die...Went here for a celebration dinner on a Sunday.  Memorable for all the wrong reasons!Service:Warm staff, but confusing setup.  Asked if I was interested in drinks, replied that I wanted to see a menu and told with a smile that they don't have a drinks menu, but that their lychee special was recommended.Asked after our entrees if we wanted dessert.  Replied yes, do you have a menu for it?  Told that there was no menu, and then waiter launched into a two minute pre memorized rendition of available desserts.At one point there was a massive thudding sound.  The conversation in the room stopped.  We turned to see one of their chefs had rolled out a cart into the dining room and was mid way through a demonstration.  After a series of more thuds, tossing, spinning and so on, he produced some noodles and received applause from the room.  He then disappeared into a back room, and the quiet conversation levels returned.  Bizarre.Decor:We were led to a tiny table for two, with a light box underneath to create a lit square under the table linen.  Not impressed - there was a tangle of cables under the table with a socket plug under my seat.  Could easily have tripped on it. (As the meal progressed, I realized those cables could be quite useful to strangle myself with to escape being at Mr Chow's any longer.)There was a beautiful white orchid arrangement on the table, but unfortunately the table was so cramped, and any time I lent over the table, the stems threatened to tickle my ears or go up my nose.We were so close to the adjacent tables, one woman (who was sitting with her back to our table) nearly dipped her hair into my fiance's glass of overpriced water.The clientele:The majority of tables looked to be occupied by well dressed middle aged men with young ladies.  On our left, there were two Chinese brothers who spent their entire meal with their phones out, and hardly spoke to each other.Food:Nothing special.  We had the chicken satay and dumplings for starters.  Presentation was nice, but food lacked punch in the spice department.  For main course we had green prawns and ma mignon.  Disappointed by the quality given the price and hype.  We don't mind paying for quality, but this was nowhere near it.Price:The final bill came to over $200 before service, and even though I wasn't paying, I felt pretty disgusted by this dining experience.  We dined at Dovetail for roughly the same price and the two were just night and day.  Don't waste your time at Mr Chow's unless you enjoy torturing yourself while paying through the nose.",5,1,0,Victoria M.,"Manhattan, NY",0,6,0

2.0,8/17/2012,"Mr. Chow and I are in a love hate relationship.  I've only been here for restaurant week, and while I, for the most part, love their food and would argue that their restaurant week offering is among the best around, I kind of hate their staff.  From the outside, one would have no idea what to expect from the windowless facade of this restaurant.  Inside I liken the Givenchy decorated dining room to a set from Scarface.  White and total 70's-80's opulence.  The sunken dining room is tight, with all of the tables visible from the elevated bar area.  Both times I've eaten here  I've been forced to wait at the bar for about 20 minutes.  I'm guessing this is an intentional way to get you to order a pricey (but delicious) cocktail.  Their lychee martinis are both delicious and potent.  Well worth the $16 price tag.  You will need a strong drink for the wait at this cramped bar, with minimal seating.  Now on to the main dining experience...At my first visit I was seated in the dining room at a two top, which was cramped.  We were allowed to order anything we wanted off of the restaurant week menu (dishes are served family style) and the staff was fine.  My most recent visit was a different story...This visit my party of four was seated at one of the two lone tables in the bar area, right next to a door, which although experienced constant traffic, I was assured was not a door to the kitchen.  (Perhaps it was the door to a portal back to 2012?)  After voicing my concern that the table was close to the ""kitchen"" the host assured me that the door was not to the kitchen, and the table was actually ""one of the best in the house"" and ""the table that all of the celebs request"".  Don't get me wrong, I love a good celeb sighting and am pretty well versed in pop culture, but I found it insulting that the host thought that since I was a 20-something female, I would be instantly satiated by the fact that my table was the ""go to"" table for the celebs.  Since moving to the main dining room equaled a wait of an additional 20 minutes, we chose to stay put.  In the end, I would have to agree that it was a better table than those in the dining room, since it offered us a lot more space to sit comfortably.  The waiter gave us the menu and told us that we would be served all of the dishes listed on the restaurant week menu.  As someone who eats gluten free, this concerned me since I was unable to enjoy all of the dishes.  After expressing this concern the waiter told me that ""It's not like gluten is a real allergy.  It's not like I would go into anaphalactic shock or anything, right?"".  Seriously?  I assured him that I would not go into shock, my immune system would just start attacking itself biggie.  So after a lot of back and forth, I was assured that most of the dishes were gluten free.  Here is our tables thoughts on the dishes from the restaurant week menu - AppetizersNoodles -  Reported by the other guests to be OK (not gluten free)Dumplings - Reported by the other guests to be very good (not gluten free)Chicken Sate - Very good (sauce is not gluten free, but I did enjoy the chicken)Squab Lettuce Wraps - I'm not going to lie, the whole squab element freaked me out, but these were greatMain CourseDrunken Fish - Very good, and not at all fishyPork - Delish.  SpicyVelvet Chicken - Very good.  Kind of stringy.  Resembled more of a noodle than chicken, but tasty nonethelessGreen Prawns - I enjoyed these on my first visit and loved them.  This time, not so much...tasted kind of fishyFried Rice - OK.  GenericString Beans - SameDessertI love dessert, but sorbet and ice cream at a restaurant are not exciting to me.  Had we not been sharing, I may even have just passed on this course altogether.  What a mistake that would have been!  Delicious vanilla ice cream with amazing passion fruit sorbet.  Perfectly melty, creamy and delicious.  May have even made me a fan of sorbet.Although I totally fought having to order all of the dishes, as opposed to choosing what we actually wanted, I'm kind of glad I lost this battle.  It forced me to try and enjoy a few dishes I wouldn't normally consider ordering (i.e., squab).So while the service on this visit was a condescending and ignorant, the food was good, restaurant week price right and portions big enough to have us leaving totally full with some food left on the table.  I'll continue my disfunctional relationship with Mr. Chow and pray that maybe, just maybe he will change and things will get better.",2,1,0,Liz M.,"Manhattan, NY",29,70,0

Mr Chow did exactly THAT for me and the whole group I was with!  (people who are going to be ""cheap"" and be ignorant to say the food is too pricey for ""chinese food"" - ugh, u guys are annoying - just don't really understand what Mr Chow is trying create in this experience)At Mr Chow, you get to sit back and relax as they do what they do best - u basically don't have to do anything except for ENJOY all its goodness - decor, food, service, ambiance.  Great Service, which their servers are always on top of it - Great Food, which our server did all the work for us as we let him know what we liked and disliked and the portions were PERFECT, right on spot, as we were all happy and full (but not that gross kind of full - perfectly satisfied - and just enough room to even have their desserts!!)  We were a party of 6 and this is what we had:- Champagne trolley: YES, of course we had to start the night off at Mr Chow with a glass of champagne!  - Definitely went with their pre-fixe menu that comes with sauteed rice and veggies- Sauteed rice was very good, not oily at all and we had the bokchoy, which were amazingggg! they made me fall in love with bok choy.- for our apps we had:  squab, chicken satay (THE BEST THING EVER), scallop, seaweed, lobster vermicelli, and the classic mr chow noodles. everything was so good.- for our main courses:  beijing duck (to die for!!), green prawns (green shrimp?? SO good), dungenous crab (omg), with three (a bit hesitant by its looks, but SOO GOOD, 3 types of meats that perfectly goes well with each other), and the lobster.- for our desserts:  the sorbet, ice cream, lychee, oranges, and chocolate pyramid.ALL that food - perfectly portioned to not make us grossly full where we had a little bit of everythinggg, dessert, AND drinks.  how do they do that??  *  I agree that the tables are a bit too close, but you won't mind the closeness of the seating arrangements if Robert Deniro is sitting right next to you!  (um, hi mr. deniro)*  My friend dined at mr chow at their tribeca location a month or two ago, and he was sitting next to jeremy lin!  (my next stop, lol)*  To the rest of you who want to have a Mr Chow experience:  know that you're going to splurge a bit (but u'll be treated like a king/queen), go with an open mind (it will definitely be more enjoyable), get ready to see some celebs (hopefully your favorite one), and know how to have fun at a fine dining restaurant!",0,0,0,Layla L.,"New City, NY",0,1,0

Bummer, but it's NYC so they get a pass. Atmosphere was super weird, blasting non-popular pop-style music (like it sounded like a 90s playlist of songs you've never heard), way too loud for the amount of people in the room.Champaign cart comes by, we decline. We don't want any $30 - $60 glasses of champaign. Someone comes by and asks if we want bubbled water or non, we say non. Champaign cart comes by again -- no, we still don't want any. Water guy comes by again a few minutes later. Champaign cart comes by again.By this point we're not happy. I'm a small business owner and I understand how margins work, but by pushing something we kept saying we didn't want they made the situation super uncomfortable.Server comes by and hands us menus and starts pushing the prix fixe options which start around $60 per person. I look over the menu, here's a gem: white rice costs $6.50, with a minimum of 2 servings.A chef comes out and starts making noodles. It's pretty sweet, the process is cool and the way he slams them down on his table is super loud and surprising to see. This was awesome *until the noodles dragged across the floor* and a server helped grab the ends and put them back onto his plate.By this point we also realize that we've now racked up over $20 in waters and that we're not going to get out of this place under $100 per person and decide we're going to head to the bar, grab some drinks and dip.Server ends up giving us shit about some minimum per person, to which we say, ""we haven't ordered anything so no, there's no minimum"". We head to the bar and grab a few drinks, pay our tab and take off.I don't have a problem with expensive restaurants, but an expensive meal should come with great food and great atmosphere. I can't comment on the food since we left, but the environment sucked.

I, had very little idea what I was getting myself into. My sister and her husband had made a reservation at the restaurant when we were planning a trip from Orlando to NYC. She was ranting and raving about how exciting it was that we were going to be eating at Mr. Chow. It was the best chinese food, etc etc. I was excited. ME + Good chinese food = HEAVEN...Then we walked into this tiny little restaurant that was supposed to hold one of the best chef's in the city..... With a setting that resembles something I imagine Celebrities would gather in the 50s.... Almost mob like. I don't think it's been updated inside since it's opening in 1979.Then, after being stuffed into a tiny table with about 1 foot between you and the next table, you are greeted by a waiter who basically informs you, you have no choice in your meal. It's basically a show case of whatever the chef is featuring that night...  The extent of your decision making, is what you'll be drinking and if you are allergic to anything or really like/really dislike anything... I started to get excited for the first time since walking in the place!It is essentially a 3 course meal. Starting with an array of appetizers like crispy sea weed, seafood dumplings, and Lettuce Wraps. Your main entree is then brought out... Sloppy but amazing drunken fish, Some amazing concoction of noodles and pork, and finally Bejing chicken that is both sweet and spicy...At one point the Chef himself came out and started making noodles in front of us. Doing it a million miles per minute. It was insane!! Really entertaining! Another thing that added to their charm.The truth is, it ISN""T your traditional asian cuisine. It is over the top and a little bizarre which to me is it's charm!!! Mr. Chow pushes the envelope a little bit, and plainly - its FUSION. Not classic asian cuisine of any region...

Pretty impressive stuff.The serve was incredible, verging on the down right rude and aggressive with plates and cutlery being swept away nano-seconds after putting something down.

2.0,2/1/2012,"My friend and I had decided to take advantage of the restaurant week menu at Mr. Chow's.  She had very good experiences at the Tribeca location so we thought we would try the East side location.  Upon arrival we patiently waited for the hostess to seat the party in front of us.  Then to our disappointment a man that had been at the bar walked right up in front of us and grabbed the hostess's attention.  As someone who spent many years in the restaurant business, the proper thing for the hostess to do is to tell the man I will be right with you after I take care of these people who were next.  Unfortunately she did not do so.  We continued to wait then finally were seated in the back of the restaurant.  A server came over and took our drink order.  We proceeded to wait about 10 minutes when we flagged down a busboy and asked for menus.  Finally our drinks came.  We waited about another 15 minutes for someone to come and take our food order.  Once again, we flagged down the server that took our drink order and were told that he does not take the food order and someone else does.  This is beyond ridiculous.  Finally our food server came and took our food over after what seemed to be over 20 minutes of waiting.  He apologized for the delay.  To start we order the Mr. Chow noodles and the chicken satay.  For our entrees my friend ordered the Drunken Fish and I ordered the Beijing Chicken.  There was definitely some confusion on our part because the waiter asked us if he could interest us in the green prawns.  We thought that was to make up for the fact that they took so long in taking our food order.  But I will get to that later.  After what seemed like another 15 minutes one of the appetizers (Mr. Chow noodles) finally came out.  The noodles were good, not fantastic but good.  After a few more minutes the chicken satay came out, which was also good. Several minutes after we finished our appetizers once again, one of the entrees came out.  This is where the confusion sets in.  The food runner brought the green prawns and white rice with shrimp.  The prawns were tasty, but again nothing spectacular.  Several minutes later the Beijing Chicken came out with string beans.  Now, I do not know if there is a problem in the kitchen that every single one of the plates we ordered came out at a different time, but something needs to be addressed somewhere.  Our server never came back to see if everything was ok.  We finally flagged him down to see where the Drunken Fish was and he said oh you ordered the green prawns.  We responded that we thought he was giving us the green prawns as a complimentary item since the service was not good and he took so long in taking the order.  The server responded absolutely not.  It actually came as no surprise since the establishment really did not seem to care about good service in the least.  In all honesty I can get the same quality of food from my local take-out guy for 1/5 of the price.  The dessert was rather disappointing as it was three small scoops of ice cream.  So after two hours we got our check and much to our surprise we were charged $10 for a small bottle of Fiji Water when we had asked for flat water.  At that point all we wanted to do was get out of there.  The server came over and asked how everything was and when my friend pretty much told him the whole experience was not what we were hoping for and that we most likely would not be back.  Again to our surprise he pretty much insulted us by saying that Restaurant Week doesn't bring in the normal type of clientele the restaurant has.  So that justifies the horrible service that we were given?  I work for one of the biggest accounting firms in the world and constantly have client lunch and dinner meetings.  And believe me when I say I will never be having one at Mr. Chow.  The whole idea behind Restaurant Week is to get people in the door.  Based on our rude treatment, I guess Mr.  Chow's isn't worried about the bad economy.  I'll stick to Ruby Foo's with good service and good food at a more reasonable price.  Avoid at all costs.",3,0,0,Denise L.,"Little Falls, NJ",6,17,0

2.0,1/1/2012,"I'm not sure if reading the reviews of Mr. Chow was more entertaining than my actual dining experience, but many of my fellow Yelpers are on to something. First off, while I'm not a firm believer that decor and ambiance dictates the overall dining experience if the food is great, I felt like I had stumbbled into a Hot Tub Time Machine set for 30 years ago so circa 1982 which was topped of with the BeeGees-esque music for the whole evening.Now that I have set the mood, the service staff's antics made me forget about the decor, etc. fast when they were so put-off when our party balked at the waiters offer to let the kitchen just prepare a meal for us. Then they pushed the pre-fix menu hard to the point of making our table uncomfortable when we actually told them that we wanted to order a la carte off the menu as if we were the first patrons to go down the menu road. So an hour later we actually got some food. Mr. Chow does serve good, not great Chinese food. Their Peking Duck was excellent however.To sum up, Mr. Chow is cliche not classic. If they updated their interior by about 30 years or so and dialed down the aforementioned hard-selling and just let their patrons enjoy what they do best which is the food, then I would return, otherwise there are hundreds of other places I would rather dine in NYC.",2,0,0,Dylan P.,"Dallas, TX",24,105,0
2.0,11/27/2011,"Before I write a review on a place, I like to take a look at what other Yelpers think.  The reviews on Mr. Chows are nothing short of hysterical.  I think if you divided people into three categories, Non-Asian, Asian USA only, Asian with extensive overseas travel experience, the average rating would be 4 for Non Asian, 2.5 for Asian USA only, and like a 1.5 for Asian with extensive overseas.  I give it two stars ONLY because I actually do believe that categories 1 and 2 will find it acceptable as a fine dining place.  Oh man... this non-Chinese girl once suggested making a reservation for Mr. Chows for Chinese New Years... I cringed and politely suggested that was a bit out of tradition.  I even took the hit that the girl thought perhaps I simply didn't know fine dining. The thing is, the food is not better than Chinatown. It's definitely edible (see review of David Burke Townhouse).  But it makes no sense on any other category other than service.  If it was not midtown pricey and attracting a good crowd, I'd be tempted to go lower.  That's not totally fair though as I'd have to doc other 2 stars down to 1 star.  The food is better than edible.  This place is more than reasonable to bring clients and fancy friends to and the service - for us anyways - was fantastic.  Here's my beef.  French food believes so passionately (and I would argue, wrongly so) that it is the only cuisine capable of complex flavors.  Chinese food - with it's 3000 year history - has that as well.  This should be what Chinese food fine dining is.In that regard, I'm going to grade it against fine dining places across the globe, just as I would Megu or Daniel.  Here Mr. Chow's falls flat.  The decor is just dated.  This decor in China or HK would be unacceptable. I want there to be a 5 star Chinese restaurant in NYC, but seriously. The food is ok, but fine dining in Asia takes it to the next level, especially in HK. I mean compare Mr. Chows to Lan in Beijing, which isn't even known for being fine dining, just fine decor, and I'd take Lan any day of the week.  Ok... that's Szechuanese.  So let's compare apples to apples to any top spot in HK.  It's going to take a major back seat.  Ok... so let's compare to Shun Lee Palace.  I still give that 3 stars for better decor and service.  In fact I've seen far more Chinese people at Shun Lee Palace than Mr. Chows.... obviously other Chinese folks agree with me on this.But such potential and definitely a great crowd.  Check it out so you can weigh in.  As for me, I've gone more than once and will probably go again as I like my non-Asian friends, despite their love of Mr. Chows.",9,5,3,May L.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",617,466,229

I had a few of my dad's classmates from college in the city, and my father had asked me to take them out, as it was the first trip to NYC for 2 of the 3 ladies. I really wanted them to experience a very NYC dining experience and I have not been to Mr. Chow, so we went there.The service was great, the decor (57th location), was very elegant and classy. Restaurant is a bit small, but I loved the inside. The ladies really enjoyed the decor and the fresh bouquet of flowers in the middle. I loved their food, we did the four-course (peking duck) menu, it was all delicious, but the portions were quite big that we had to take some home, so order wisely based on the # of people at the table, as it's all family style. The duck was amazing, the crab meat was awesome, sea bass was grilled to perfection, I had two different kind of shrimp dishes, both were outstanding. Their famous chicken satay was amazingly good, I loved it. There were these black noodles with seafood I believe, I forgot what it was called, but I've never had anything like that, it was very good. I've had plenty of fusion Chinese food before, and most of the time it's a hit or miss, because I could easily go to Chinatown and have authentic Chinese/Cantonese food for less than half the price of what these places charge you, but Mr. Chow, along with Buddakan and a few others really impress me with their quality of the fusion food, as well as the presentation and service. As a Cook myself, presentation, taste, and the ambiance are necessary ingredients for a good meal, it's a journey. From the Fiji water to the wait staff with uniforms pulling out your chair, to fresh flowers, and hot entrees, my journey was very enjoyable.  Okay, let's get to the stuff that everyone always ask..the prices. Yes, it's very very pricey, and one would think why would I pay this much for Chinese food in NYC, when you can almost get any type of Chinese food for any price elsewhere. And I completely agree, however like I said before from the beginning to the end of my meal, I was very content and satisfied, it was more than the food, it's all about the little details which make up the big picture (in my opinion).  Would I come here every weekend or every month, probably not, but for special occasions,  I think it's def a must. Overall, I enjoyed it (maybe because I didn't have to pay? LOL), but regardless I would come back, it was an incredible dining journey.

Not sure-- for appetizers, the squab and iceberg lettuce leaves were good and satisfying. The Mr. Chow noodles were presented in a very frightening way, a bunch of plain noodles with the odd colored sauce slapped on. The water (pork) dumplings were decent. For the family style entrees, the fried rice was good (Buddhakan's is better) and the green prawns were the best thing---spicy though somewhat slimy. Stay away from the drunken fish-- it is fishy, sweet, thick with cornstarch, and overall I could not even eat the portion I gave myself. (and I eat everything). The chicken is good, spicy with candied prawns.And I was extremely insulted by 1 dessert for 3 girls. Who does that?!?! Dessert is the best thing about restaurant week!!

The service is odd, the decor odder.  The hostess had the personality of a wet towel and the staff was so serious about everything it was kind of uncomfortable.  I actually laughed at one point because they were so extreme about it.  Drinks were expensive and light on the alc.  I drank my first cosmo like it was juice - because it was.  Apparently we caught the early bird special.  From 6-7 is their ""pre-theatre"" meal option.  An appetizer and main dish with a side for something like $40.  (Also offered after 10PM).  We went with it because the options were what we wanted.  The chicken satay was highly recommended and I can see why.  It  was cooked perfectly and had a light creamy peanut sauce.  The Mr. Chow Noodles were meh.  Somewhat tasteless.  For main dishes we got the green prawns and crispy beef.  The explanation of anything on the menu is actually absurd and the waiter was no help.  Thankfully the green prawns were good.  Garlicky and small but good.  The crispy beef was the favorite but I am not sure there was actually any beef in the crispy strips.  The side of greens we got was way to salty.  Green tea ice cream for dessert was a unique and nice way to end a really awkward meal.",5,2,1,Are M.,"New York, NY",154,229,24

2.0,2/5/2011,"Mr. Chow Not! Dined here during restaurant week with my galpal. My fascination for Mr.Chow is due to TMZ camera men staking celebrities at the Beverly Hills location. My galpal told me that former VP, Al Gore dined here. Who cares about the former VP?! I was hoping a glimpse of any celebrities. Anyway, much to our dismay, there were no TMZ camera men in front of this location. To my surprise this restaurant is small. If it's just two of you, you will be squeezed into the small table sitting side by side against the back wall with other parties of two all on top of each other. The fascinating thing about sitting at these tables was a light built into the center of the table, which serves no purpose because the restaurant is well lit. Okay, here our meal breakdown: Appetizers: Mr. Chow noodles and dumplings. These were meh and disappointing. The presentation of Mr .Chow noodles was not appetizing. A saucy meat medley on top of plain linguine. My first thought was vomit over noodles. It was so hard to get the noodles off the serving plate because the meat is not mixed in the noodles and the noodles were so long. Dumplings were color green and so-so. I prefer the fried dumplings that you can get off the food carts in flushing. Entrees: Chicken and Pork. The real winner was the pork. It had this speck of hot spice that made the sliced strips of pork really delish. The chicken was a boring dish of stir fried chicken strips that you can get anywhere. Both dishes were not oily or too saucy. So I give Mr. Chow's an extra star for that. The entrees were served with baby bok choy and white rice. Dessert - you get only one dessert for two. Say what?! You only get one dessert to share? That's breaking the restaurant week rule of one appetizer, one entree, and one dessert per person! You had a choice of sorbet or ice cream. We choose the sorbet. Wow, this chinese restaurant does not have dessert chef in the kitchen. Also, ordered lychee martinis at $16 for one. Skip this - a total waste of $$. To my surprise, I was full. Because the portions are small, you do eat everything. We had some entree leftovers and told the waiter to wrap this up. After not getting the doggy bag from the waiter, I figured they forgot. As we were leaving, my galpal received a hot pink gift bag from the hostess at the door. I thought they were giving away some kind of gift, alas, it was the leftovers. We were so done in an hour so it was not a leisured dining experience. This place was full and busy when we left. The crowd was mostly upper east side snobs. I did not see celebrities but a group of basketball athletes and their coach sat near us.  My galpal said a funny question, Are they going to order off the RW menu?

I don't think so.  The decor made me feel like I was in a tacky cruise ship restaurant.  And, the scent of the lilies in the center of the restaurant, next to our table, was overwhelming and took away from the food.  Overall, very unpleasant dining experience and will not be planning to come back here..",0,0,0,YJ A.,"Manhattan, NY",5,85,2

Some people at the table only wanted appetizers but the waiter refused to allow this to happen.  I'm not kidding.  He literally would not let us order so little food.  After not letting us order what we wanted to order, we waited quite a long time for our food to arrive.  All of this would have been forgiven if the food was any good but that simply was not the case.  We all ordered different things and tried each other's food.  The portions were very small and none of it was good; You can get the same food from the freezer section from any super market.   For all of this, we paid about $250 for the four of us.  I've paid more than this at other restaurants and felt glad to do it.  But in all those cases the service was excellent and the food superb.  The ironic thing about this evening is the next night my husband and I went to a hole in the wall Chinese restaurant he used to go to and for $15 we got way better food.",6,3,2,Liz L.,"Los Angeles, CA",221,46,7

I knew it was going to be bad when the first appetizer of cheeto covered chicken came out. Neon orange chicken covered in a sloppy white sauce. The worst was a three way tie between the msg encrusted beef, the slimy worm chicken and the mysterious ""green"" covered shrimp which I'm convinced was food coloring because of the fluorescence of the color and lack of any flavor. This place is for all the upper east siders who don't want to get their tires dirty in china town to have real chinese food and as a result of the incredibly high price, think it is FANTASTIC. I'm telling you i could have gotten better food from a truck. Oh and on a side note, the decor is heinous.

Not worth it even for any type of ""experience"" that you're hoping for just because this place is so hyped up.Let's just put it this way: I registered on Yelp only so that I could leave a bad review for this trash restaurant. What made it such a bad experience? Everything, really.But most of all, it was the waiter. Even though it's a ""Chinese"" restaurant there is not one single Chinese person in there working at the place. And it's not Americans either. No one there spoke English well, and our waiter was the most aggravating little piece I've ever come across.Absolutely terrible service.He was quickly getting annoyed with us that we weren't making any decisions right away at our table - and even more annoyed that we were not letting him choose our food for us.He was worse than a used-car salesman. I have never met a waiter like this. He was pushing things on us non-stop. Even after 5 times!! we told him we don't want the appetizer+course combo that he was pushing on us, he still insisted nonstop.And what was most aggravating. One person in our group wasn't very hungry, and she just wanted an appetizer. We asked our server to bring hers out together with our main dishes. He said he can't do that. No explanation, no attempt for good service or to accomodate us. He was a passive aggressive prick that just kept on saying, with a bitchy smile: ""yes sir, we will bring this out first for everyone to share and then the main course"" - and I kept on telling him there is no sharing on this dish, it's just for her, and it's supposed to come together with everyone else's. But NO, he kept on pretending like I am asking him to bring it out first. I got incredibly frustrated. He ruined our dinner before we ever ordered any food. Terrible terrible service.And then he just started ignoring us and didn't even come up ONCE to check up on us. Even had some busboy come bring the check at the end.Prices are also outrageous. We paid $15 for a damn little piece of pie that was so small that a baby could accidentally inhale - thinking that it just suckled on a pacifier.Please please please don't go to this place.

The restaurant looks beautiful, is well laid-out, and although smaller than I thought, the upscale setting is quite intimate and comfortable. The host and waiters were all very nice and attentive.However, I must say that I expected a lot more in terms of the food. I had heard that this was one of the best, if not the best, place to go to for Chinese food in Manhattan, but I really wasn't impressed. I think Mr. Chow has the reputation it does because some people who didn't grow up with Chinese food aren't sure where the clean, nice Chinese restaurants are in Manhattan and the surrounding areas, so by default, Mr. Chow is over-rated.My date and I ordered crab soup, salt and pepper prawns, some sort of shrimp rice dish, gambler's duck (basically like peking duck), bok choy, and some green tea ice cream. We also ordered two drinks, and without tip, the bill came out to be $185.00. The food tasted ok, but you're basically paying 10x what you'd pay for the same food in either Flushing or Chinatown! Actually, the peking duck and bok choy in other, much cheaper restaurants are better. The peking duck at Mr. Chow was really too dry and the bok choy was too oily. Overall, just an ok experience. I think you're paying for the ambiance and saying you went to Mr. Chow, rather than the actual food.

The decor is also lovely, especially the lovely centerpiece of orchids.   The BadThe issue here is consistency.  Some dishes are excellent, some are lousy.  The good stuff included the rice, for which they use basmati, which is excellent.  Another great dish was the sea bass made with egg.  It looks totally white and tasteless but it is actually delicious and inventive.  That's the kind of unexpected combination of flavors I expect to find in high-end restaurants -- things I would never imagine on my own.    The velvet chicken was quite mediocre and the lamb was ruined by the sauce. The crispy beef is mostly sweet deep-fried batter, so it tastes good because it's full of stuff that's really bad for you, not because of a delightful combination of flavors.  On the appetizer front, the grilled prawns were quite good (especially the garlic and scallions) and the lettuce wraps with plum sauce were good. There was also some sort of chopped fish appetizer we ordered that was very good but whose name escapes me.    The chicken satay was rubbery and tasteless as was the appetizer noodle dish (although others in the party seemed to like it).  The UglyThe place is loud.  Granted, there were 2 big groups while we were there, one of them a sweet 16 party, but I think the acoustics of the room do not help.  In SumOverall, I would say this place is worth it only if you really like Chinese food, if you choose your dishes carefully, and if you don't plan to have a quiet and intense conversation.",0,1,0,Komal B.,"Miami Beach, FL",92,173,8

In the 45 minutes in which we waited for a table (remember, we had a reservation), we heard two renditions of ""Happy Birthday"" and I had to remind myself that I wasn't at T.G.I.Fridays.  Can you say tacky?I can't comment on the food, since my friends and I left, disappointed and annoyed.  This is the worst Restaurant Week experience I've ever had.  And honestly, I don't think I'd even want to try to go back to Mr. Chow.",1,1,0,Krista J.,"Brooklyn, NY",749,1181,35

It definitely helps to know the menu if you're going to be limited by the size of your party, so here were our picks (all recommended): drunk fish, noodes with lobster, fried rice with shrimp, sea bass, a variety of veggie sides. The place totally screams 80s art scene, which is fun in light of the cuisine. Compared to other dinner places, it's super well-lit.

The Chicken satays, lettuce cups, fiery buffalo, shark fin soup, and gamblers duck are amazing!  The drinks are always potent and you'll probably see a celeb or two during the course of you meal.",4,2,3,Andre L.,"New York, NY",216,195,2
4.0,1/1/2009,"I like a nice night out on the town, so this place was good for me.  The decor was great, the waiters were professional.The food was good and I like the fact that they bring you whatever they want you to have (within reason), just because it's a change from the normal routine.I had dinner here with my gf and another couple and we had a nice time.  One of those places that you leave and say later to your significant other, ""I had a nice time tonight baby.""The end.",0,0,0,Rod D.,"Pasadena, CA",130,102,26
1.0,8/8/2008,"I vowed never to go back here again after my first experience.  Mediocre, very very overpriced food, and just generally not a great selection.  I don't mind paying much for good food, but this is food that many Chinese restaurants in Chinatown would beat by a mile.  There is nothing unique on this menu to justify any of the prices they charge.  If you literally have no value for money and just want some Chinese food, and refuse to go anywhere else, I guess you could come here and get some.  Other than that, I would not recommend any meals here.",2,0,0,Winston G.,"Chicago, IL",458,809,23
3.0,7/16/2008,"I am giving my experience three stars because it was one dish better than the experience I had in Los Angeles (my first Mr Chow experience). Mr. Chow plates good food, but that's it.  Average tasting, even a bit over thought, food. I do have to say the fried seaweed was awesome and I could not get enough, kudos. Sadly, every other dish was described perfectly and left my mouth watering, but then each bite was like ok this alright, I am pretty sure I have had something similar before. Service is impeccable and the wine list is good (Stags' Leap Cabernet), but that is what you are paying for here. If you want a formal atmosphere, gorgeous decor, and to be dotted upon, by all means line up........but do not expect the food to knock your socks off.",2,1,1,Theresa T.,"Oakland, CA",122,323,2
4.0,6/29/2008,"I prefer the original Mr. Chow to Tribeca - even though I do like the outdoor patio there.  My favorite dish is the velvet chicken, polished off with an apple martini.  Love the ambiance and the food - always a winner for me.",1,0,0,Dena S.,"Portland, OR",63,148,0
2.0,12/13/2007,"What a pretentious place! I had images that this place would be so much larger considering the HUGE doors, but it turned out to be rather small. Surprised the waiters had enough room to maneuver around as well as prep the food on the back table.I was taken here during one of my company dinners and i couldn't believe  this place. while the food ranged from weird (crispy shredded seaweed skewing sweet) to good ( crispy balls with mysterious meat - so warm!), it was definetly not worth the price. granted, i didn't foot the bill.. but i'm hazarding the dinner was close to a grand or more. i still don't understand why a menu was not given. you only get a wine list. i guess you're supposed to leave it up to the waiters? i would've liked to know what i was eating and had more say. with that being said, our table specifically said that seafood was not our thing but it was still brought out in almost every dish! berry pie/cake for dessert was delicious though i'd like to know what that red berry was.in conclusion - nice experience but don't go if you have to pay for it yourself....",3,1,1,Joanie K.,"Brooklyn, NY",163,823,27
5.0,11/28/2007,"yum, yum, yum... yum.  I can't believe the reviews are so low for Mr. Chow's... probably because it is very expensive... but hey, good things cost money my friends.  And yes, while Mr. Chow's will cost you aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaalot... it is worth every penny... and the ambiance is very old school.  Highly recommend.",0,0,0,Jonathan T.,"Brooklyn, NY",491,56,10

1.0,9/1/2006,"The east 57th street location is WAY over rated. First the waiter decides for you what you will eat. Second the food was just OK. Not amazing nor awful but just OK. Third, when the bill comes you will be shocked by the amount they charge. Way too expensive!",4,0,1,Elizabeth T.,"Lacey, WA",366,90,19
5.0,3/26/2006,"Amazing Chinese food in a fun, trendy setting.  Ridiculous people-watching scene - one time sat next to Lenny Kravitz and always high likelihood of spotting professional athletes (or at least well-dressed 6'10"" guys with hot young dates).  The space is classic '80s New York garishness... black and white with mirrors everywhere...   But the real attraction is definitely the food.  Everything on the menu is outstanding and has just the right degree of creativity - not too contrived but still unique and worlds away from your neighborhood take out.    The best way to go is to let the waiter order for your table but beware - the bill (even without drinks) can creep up to the high double digits per person quickly.  Great date spot if you're trying to impress and don't  mind paying up.  Even better place if you on expense account!",0,0,0,Randy K.,"New York, NY",3,21,0
2.0,1/24/2006,"The food is very average.  And for the price of dinner, the food should be much better.  The waiters are friendly and the restaurant is cozy, but not worth the outrageous prices.",1,1,1,Lori M.,"New York, NY",0,180,0
