3.0,4/12/2019,"I've been to the Boston location many times and loved it.  I was less than impressed by the Manhattan location.  Restaurant space looks like it's stuck in the 90's and it's in the basement.  We were given a nice spacious table which was a surprise in NYC so I will take that.  However, the service was not great and our server never bothered once to ask how our meal was going once we received our food.  We had to ask him for another round of cocktails and he seemed half interested.  My 18 oz ribeye was definitely not Medium temp as I ordered it and was dry and not pink except for the center.  It was still tasty tho and the garlic accompaniment on the plate was a nice surprise.   My partner ordered the short rib and said it was tender and well prepared.  I'll visit the Boston location again but not midtown NYC.  Too many other better steakhouses and overall better restaurant experiences.",0,0,0,Fabian T.,"Orlando, FL",0,6,0
4.0,4/7/2019,Great atmosphere and welcoming staff. Great wine selection and wonderful meatballs and spring roll sampler. Yes I know how strange that sounds but. It's true. The entree's are just ok. We had the bolognese and the spaghetti- but neither were remarkable. Good but nothing outstanding. I would go back.,0,0,0,Jarrid S.,"Seattle, WA",47,138,9
5.0,3/29/2019,Davio's is an absolute gem. Jenny the General Manager and her staff are worthy of a Michelin for service and food. I was fortunate to celebrate my father in laws 80th birthday and she and her staff could not have made the experience more special. Top shelf restaurant with an excellent ambiance complimented by fantastic food and service. Thanks so much. Will have to become a repeat offender even if I am just a visitor to New York.

2.0,3/15/2019,"Touted for homemade pasta. We sampled three varieties. Each was over cooked and extremely salty. I'm wondering if the Chef is Italian as the concept of ""al dente"" was nonexistent.

In addition, this particular location offers a different prix fixe menu each Valentines Day. Despite my initial disappointment, we ordered dinner from the regular menu and it was great.

4.0,2/16/2019,"Thank you Davio's for a terrific Valentines Day dinner for my fiancé and I. The area of midtown east is extremely convenient for all of my fellow midtown commuters to get to. We walked over to the restaurant from our offices where we had our confirmed 5:45 reservation and after we checked our coats we had a very warm welcome as we were escorted to our table.I don't know what it was but their bread was insanely good. We kept it light on the appetizers and went with the cheese steak spring rolls. Not the best I've ever had, but still very tasty. Our server was extremely attentive and professional, and nowhere close to overbearing. Drinks were nice and strong : ) For our entrees we went with a filet and shrimp followed by a salmon with a beet flavored couscous, with the sides being the onion rings (amazing) and some asparagus. It was a great well rounded meal full of flavor and really set off by the ambiance of the venue. Would definitely take another trip back here in the future and recommend trying for first timers.",0,0,0,Jason R.,"West Long Branch, NJ",202,12,10

5.0,11/30/2018,"I am a huge believer of things always working out in the end and this restaurant is just another example proving that theory correct.My Fiancee and I were visiting NYC for Thanksgiving 2018 and we made the mistake of not immediately booking a restaurant to have Thanksgiving dinner at.  I don't know why, but I just didn't think it would be an issue to find a place.  About a week prior to our trip, I decided to make reservations and quickly found out mostly everything was booked up.In fact, the only reason why we decided on Davio's was because it was connected to our hotel and there weren't many other options.  However, I am glad this was the case.  We had a great experience and amazing.We scheduled our reservations for 6:00 pm.  When we got there, the hostess greeted us by name and immediately sat us.  Jessie, our waiter, was on top of his game.  He came to our table, greeted us by name, and proceeded to explain to us what was on the menu.  We had the option of doing the fixed Thanksgiving menu or something off  of their regular menu.  We chose the latter.We started off with a free appetizer (spring rolls).  Because we were staying at the hotel, Chris from Club Quarters made this happen.We then decided on the 10 oz. Filet Mignon.  Items are ordered a la carte.  We ordered mashed potatoes and asparagus.  The best part about this was, at the beginning, I mentioned to Jessie I wanted a beverage when my steak came out.  When the steak was served, I completely forgot about it lol.  However, Jessie was on it.  he brought it out without a reminder and that was pretty cool.For dessert, the exact name escapes me, we had a chocolate like dessert with vanilla ice cream and berries.  It was delicious.After all this, we received 15% off because we were guests of the hotel.The next day was the icing on the cake.  They called us to make sure everything we had was to our liking. And, when we went to the Club Quarters' Hotel Happy Hour (upstairs), we ran into one of the staff members from Davio's (They had provided sandwich samples for the evening.) and he greeted us by name! That was pretty awesome.  For you to recognize a guest from the night before is something we all can do.  But, to recognize us and immediately remember us by name, that was a great feeling.  I am glad we stumbled across this place and will definitely visit again.",1,0,0,Joshua R.,"Whittier, CA",145,106,347

5.0,10/11/2018,"As other reviewers have mentioned, the restaurant is quite dimly lit, and located underneath a building, which I was skeptical of at first. Nonetheless, the ambience is intimate and elegant, and the service was attentive and unpretentious. My boyfriend and I came here for lunch at 11:30 AM on a weekday, and were one of the few patrons in the restaurant. As it got closer to noon/12:30, more and more people filtered in, and the restaurant was quite lively. He ordered the Bison Burger, which comes with fresh mozzarella, pancetta, avocado, and balsamic aioli. He wanted it medium-well, which I would argue was a little too overcooked - I think the Bison Burger would taste best medium or medium-rare. The bison was slightly tough. Nonetheless, the smokiness was quite nice, and the flavor profile was more unique than your average burger. I ordered the Grilled Chicken sandwich, which came with swiss, tomatoes, lettuce, avocado, spicy aioli. I cannot believe I'm calling a sandwich amazing, but it really was. The focaccia bread was spongy but also structured. The spicy aioli provided a flavorful kick, and was the perfect complement to the avocado (fresh) and grilled chicken (juicy and well-seasoned). Both meals were a fair and reasonable price for a nice lunch in midtown Manhattan. Both entrees came with a very, very generous serving of their Parmigiano Truffle fries. I consider myself to be a fries connoisseur, and conclude that Davio's Parmigiano truffle fries are some of the best parmesan truffle fries I've had in my life. The parmesan, truffles, and salt were in perfect harmony, with no ingredient overwhelming the others. Fantastically crispy on the outside, yet soft on the inside, and not too greasy.",2,1,1,Claire L.,"New Haven, CT",650,113,136

5.0,10/1/2018,"I had such a great experience here and I will definitely be coming back! The restaurant is located down some stairs but it has a classy and laid-back vibe. We came for dinner so it had nice warm mood-lighting, but my favorite thing about the ambiance is that it was nice, quiet, and relaxed--somehow the layout made it so that each table got some privacy from the others. I hate it when you have to yell so that others in your table can hear you; this was definitely not the case here. We started at the bar while the table was being set up, and got happy hour wine for only $6. It also came with some complimentary spring rolls. My Pinot Grigio was delicious. Our waitress was incredibly pleasant! So friendly and warm, and she was very patient as we asked questions about the menu. When my guest did not like the taste of his second glass of wine, she brought him another one to try. The food was delicious. Instead of bread, they give you popovers. Be careful, because they are yummy but very filling! For starters, we got the Murray's Burrata/Prosciutto and crab cake. Both fantastic. Saw many other tables order the tuna tartare and it looked great, too.I got the simple spaghetti for my main dish. The sauce was a bit too sour/acidic for my taste, but the pasta was perfectly al dente. My guest ordered the prix fixe eggplant and hanger steak. The eggplant was fine but not stellar, but the hanger steak was cooked to perfection. All in all, I would rate this place a 4 for food, but because of the stellar service and ambience, I give it a 5!",1,1,1,Christine X.,"Manhattan, NY",385,110,51

As soon as I arrived, I was greeted warmly by the host. Once seated, our awesome waiter Jenner,  came right over and started the evening off right, with wine of course! Well I just had water with lemon lol. He came out we with a sample of the wine to make sure the ladies liked it, that was cool. Now to the goods, the food! I ordered Fettuccine with Shrimp.

5.0,8/30/2018,"This place oozes good service. Sorry, great service. My first test with them was with mealpal. Salmon over farro and spinach and cranberries. Best salmon ever. I'm not even a fish lover. The salmon was perfectly  cooked and the skin was crispy :) Yesterday I started with a frose at happy hour. The bartender was really nice. Apparently they give you complimentary apps but I did not get any at first. They rectified it shortly though once I told them. Their popovers are these sinful cheesy, buttery bread. Seriously, do not check yourselves; these are awesome.The eggplant with peppers and goat cheese is a great vegetarian appetizer. The pesto is divine :) probably made fresh.The hangar steak was good but you know - they are a steakhouse so no surprises there. It came with mushrooms and fennel and that was a nice complimenting side. This 2 course dinner was $45. Yes I'm not kidding. They are a fancy place but their menus cater to people like us as well :) good food, great service, excellent time!This might be my go to from now on :)",1,1,1,Dolonchapa C.,"New York, NY",166,279,869
3.0,8/24/2018,"3.5 out of 5 stars for Davio's here.  I had very high expectations but it just did not meet them. Nothing was bad, however nothing was out of this world either. I was with a group of people for lunch so we got an assortment of apps: sampler of spring rolls, meatballs, crab cake, and tuna tartare. My least favorite out of those was the crab cake, something was just off about it couldn't figure it out. Meatballs were by far the best. I only got to try the shrimp spring roll and I have no complaints there. For my main dish I got the prime flat iron which was very good. Both the steak and fries were cooked perfectly.  I am not even a big fan of broccoli rabe and I though that was good also. Overall, like I said, nothing was out of this world, nothing ""popped"" to put it over the top, and that, Yelp Nation, is why I give them 3.5 out of 5.

3.0,8/16/2018,"Came here for lunch during the one of the weekdays. 3-course lunch option seemed pretty good so I gave that a try......the catch is you have to pay additional $5 for the dessert so it's not REALLY a 3-course meal....more like 2-course + optional if you want to pay extra....In any case, I started out with the soup of the day which was okay. Very bland and definitely could've used more seasoning.....the main course was pasta with sausage and it was pretty good I would say....not what I had in mind so I was a bit caught off guard but at least it tasted good.For dessert, we shared gelati. Forgot the flavors but came in three different flavors. That was really delicious.I would say overall you can expect your typical Davio's experience here.

5.0,6/15/2018,"We heard about Davio's from friend who recently enjoyed dinner there and decided to try it out.  We went on a special night, it was a birthday dinner for one of us.  When we arrived, they greeted us by name, saying happy birthday and when we got to the table, there was a birthday card, personally written there too (a VERY NICE touch!)!!!They have a decent wine list, many Italian wines, as well as many notable CA and other wines.  We did have an issue with the wine we ordered, as the vintage in the menu was 2015, but we were brought a 2016.  After doing some research, we decided to give it a try and fortunately, it was fine.The table bread they give are pop overs, which is quite interesting.  They were pretty good.  Service throughout the evening was nice, not over-the-top, but nice.  Their menu is pretty decent, loaded with not only steakhouse specialties, but also some really nice Italian and seafood options too.The various items we ordered were very good and nicely plated.  Overall, we enjoyed our dinner and the food and would definitely return!",0,0,0,J E.,"Stafford, VA",12,913,2444
3.0,6/5/2018,"Davio's seems like one of the few restaurants in the area that had any character at all, which is why I chose to come here. I suppose some people may enjoy the selection in midtown central, but unless you're eating at grand central, I feel the choices are a little boring.Davio's doesn't offer anything groundbreaking, but I still had reasonable expectations because it's a little more expensive that other places in the neighbourhood, and because it's managed to exist as a business for some time in the cutthroat environment that is the new york restaurant scene.The interior here is pretty nice- spacious, yet not cavernous like a lot of the midtown joints are. The servers are nice enough, and they have a coat check service. The food itself is well... it's good, and they have a decent offering as far as italian choices go. I'm glad this place specializes in Italian steak, because I really do believe it has a distinct character that sets it apart from its american counterpart, but I unfortunately didn't try it when I visited. Instead, I got the pasta with veal sauce, since it sounded pretty appealing in the moment. I also got an appetizer in the form of the eggplant (with tomato sauce), and ate a lot of their bread as well. I think I typically have higher expectations when coming to a nice restaurant, so even though the food was good, I didn't think it especially stood out at the time, and even now after a few weeks of visiting, I can't recall any distinct features, so a three star review seems about right. I would probably come again if i needed a nicer choice in midtown, and hopefully next time I'll get a chance to try an actual steak here.",1,1,1,Matt L.,"New York, NY",108,694,604
5.0,5/27/2018,"An absolutely incredible restaurant in one of the busiest parts of the city, but you wouldn't know it during your visit. Tucked away downstairs from Hotel Boutique, my wife and I went on Saturday evening during Memorial Day weekend (making it much quieter than usual which was good!)Our waiter's name was Jamie, a 23 year old from Dublin with the patience of a saint and incredible customer service. My wife is a vegan and he did all he could to accommodate her needs. Unfortunately there wasn't too many options so she settled on the quinoa stuffed peppers. They were fairly standard; of course, this is not what Davio's is known for. Nevertheless, she did enjoy it.Now for the best part - I ordered Jamie's recommendation: the 24 oz. bone-in rib eye. Honestly one of the best steaks of my life! Cooked medium rare, it was tender, juicy, and with a perfect crispy sear. I would have picked up the bone and cleaned it up, but it was a fancy restaurant after all!The steak came a la carte, so I opted to add the Brussel sprouts side dish: AMAZING. It had a carrot purée mixed in and topped with slivered almonds. A perfect side (and the wife loved it too!)Desserts are bountiful but not vegan. We opted to get the coconut sorbet. If you want a sweet (but not too sweet) and refreshing dessert, I highly recommend it.We will definitely be visiting Davio's again as it had my Top 3: good service, good atmosphere, and good food.",0,0,0,Jamie W.,"Fair Lawn, NJ",71,43,18

4.0,2/1/2018,"Pretty good steakhouse in Midtown East. We came here on New Year's Eve (with reservations, of course) and were seated immediately upon arrival. Although I had requested a booth, they were unable to accommodate my request. Our table was a few steps away from the hostess desk, which meant other patrons of the restaurant would sometimes stand close to our table. Moreover, people were constantly entering and leaving the restaurant, and since our table was the closest to the bottom of the stairs, we felt cold air waves for most of our dinner. The space itself is not ostentatious, with sparse decorations apart from a couple paintings on the walls. Our waiter was friendly and funny, and gave us helpful recommendations. We ordered a cocktail and a glass of wine, which arrived after some delay  due to the fact that it was NYE. We ordered the spaghetti for our appetizer. It was quite delicious, cooked al dente and made with San Marzano tomatoes. The serving size was a little too small to share with one other person. For my main course, I ordered the sea scallops (I don't eat steak so I am usually limited to seafood at steakhouses). The dish comes with 4 large scallops. They were cooked properly and were very succulent and tender. We also ordered the truffle fries, which were delicious. I wish that the serving sizes were a little bigger at Davio's. I find that I'm usually quite full after a steakhouse dinner, but I still felt hungry after our NYE dinner. Perhaps, if the scallops were served on a bed of mushroom risotto, that would be a nice touch.

The dining area is very large and elegant. Went for restaurant week. The bresaola carpaccio was good although the greens were a little overdressed. My hanger steak was delicious even if it came out a little rare. I'd rather have it more rare than well any day, so I was good. My friend's branzino was done perfectly to her liking. The crème brulee was too sweet for me so they kindly gave me gelato instead, which was very good with interesting flavors. The lavender-berry(?) one was kind of weird, but I couldn't stop eating it.

However we were brought the wrong dish not once but twice. The waiter was very nice about it though and payed for the dessert that got mixed up. The wait time was pretty fast. The prices aren't too high, median price per normal dish being about $30. I ordered a pasta with black truffles, and a Boston salad. The salad exceeded my expectations (I'm not really a salad person) and I highly recommend it. The food was good, service adequate - I'd recommend Davio's for a one-time visit.Also, the atmosphere was indeed very classy, formal and nice. It's not noisy like in some of similar restaurants.

I was excited to come here as Davio's was participating in New York's white truffle week. I'll admit the wine and popovers were very good but the appetizers were subpar. We ordered the buffalo chicken spring rolls, cocktail shrimp, truffle fries, and black truffle gnocchi, all of which were very ok. The only thing i enjoyed were the goat cheese puffs. For my main course, i ordered the special steak with white truffle and although the steak was good, it was not worth it for the 2 pieces of white truffle shaved on my entree. The mushroom risotto accompaniment had an off taste to it as well. The service was also pretty good, hence, my 3 star rating. Luckily the chocolate soufflé we ordered for dessert was a hit but overall, I was not impressed by this restaurant. I'm glad I tried it, but I've had better steak and pasta in the city before, so I don't think I will be returning.",0,0,0,Raveena L.,"Jersey City, NJ",350,11,18

Got the spring roll sampler. Didn't like it at all. So bready and didn't taste the filling in them. Then we got the chicken parm (not on the menu) and braised beef anglioni. Guess the chicken parm isn't on the menu for a reason - it was terrible. As an Italian restaurant you should know how to make a chicken cutlet, and you don't. The beef pasta was okay, very rich truffles and way to small of a portion. Didn't taste the beef either, just the truffles. Maybe you should consider just serving the bread and wine.",0,1,0,Duney M.,"New York, NY",1,64,1

Had reservation for 745 on a Saturday night for a party of 8, although we arrived late and the full party wasn't there we still got seated right away. we started off with their complimentary bread which was phenomenal, crispy on the outside warm and soft on the inside. For our appetizer we started off with theirSpanish Octopus with squash salad and cranberry glaze, Crispy chicken liver, Tuna tartare, Baked eggplants, and their Philly cheesesteak spring roll. They were all absolutely delicious if there was one dish i would recommend it would be their spanish octopus although all their fishes were seasoned very well the flavors of the Spanish octopus stood out to me the most, i also liked their crispy chicken liver but its not a dish everyone will like base on their tastebud preferences cause the taste of chicken liver could be overwhelming. For entrees we had :Spaghetti Basil tomatoes and San Marzano; it was good but the sauce was a little too salty, Tagliatelle bolognese with braised veal, beef, pork and tomato sauce, Free range chicken with taro puree and crispy taro; Swordfish with basil fregola, roasted corn, and avocado; swordfish was a little too overcooked, Chilean Sea Bass; amazing! get it!, seared scallops with porcini risotto; it was good but their bacon that was served on my plate was completely burnt, kinda disappointing, and their NY strip. I really recommend their chilean sea bass everything on the plate was delicious. For dessert i recommend their panna cotta.

5.0,7/28/2017,"Had dinner here last week and it was amazing. Here are my thoughts:Service: When we first walked it, we were welcomed immediately by the maitre'd, Shawn, who seemed very poised, professional, and friendly. He walked us to our table and introduced the server, Jesse, who also took great care of us. He was very attentive through the entire meal and was very informative about the food which I found helpful. The maitre'd would come every now and then to make sure everything was okay- what a nice touch. And when we were leaving, he was sure enough to say goodbye with a friendly smile leaving us feeling great about our dining experience.Food:Appetizers- we ordered the gazpacho, octopus, and the Murray's Cheese burrata. They were very delicious. I usually don't eat much cheese, but this was very light and delightful. The octopus was very flavorful. Entree -we ordered Braised Veal Agnolotti, Halibut, and Steak. They were all so scrumptious. The pasts was amazing with the black truffles. The fish was my favorite; light and flaky with some yummy corn and barley all around it. And the steak was perfectly done. It was so juicy and tender, I couldn't stop eating it even though I was getting full. Dessert- is presented very beautifully. They show you all the actual dessert(not a paper menu) on a cart and when you choose it, they bring you a fresh new one from the kitchen. I found this very interesting.Overall- I would highly recommend it for group gatherings and dates more than a casual catch-up with a friend. Also, definitely a great choice for business lunch and dinners it seems. No dress code, but it has a nice decor to it that it makes you want to dress up a bit. :)",4,1,1,Jay K.,"New York, NY",36,182,143

Upon entering you have to immediately walk down a small flight of stairs. The restaurant is very spacious with a nice dim but not to dark ambiance. Perfect for a client dinner or just dinner with friends. It did not give the of the romantic feel or anything intimate.We were greeted immediately by a super nice hostess and got seated right away in a large and spacious booth. Our waiter came to greet us right away and she was friendly and warm as well.From this point on things kind of went downhill. We chose the spring roll sampler for appetizer and I went with the linguini and clams for my main. We also got a side of asparagus to share. The spring roll sampler was actually really good, my favorite was the buffalo chicken or cheese steak. The spicy dipping sauce that was included made it the perfect combination. The rest was okay. The linguini and asparagus was not good however. The linguini had almost no taste. I felt that it was missing seasoning or something to give it a kick, all I tasted was butter and noodles. The asparagus tasted way to over cooked and under seasoned as well. For the high price of each item it was definitely not worth it.Overall the high cost of the food for what it was is not worth it.

They came out a perfect Medium with truffled french fries. Who knew lobster, béarnaise and burger could take so good in one bite!?My only complaint might be a little too large a portion. But it was really good!The hostess sat us at a nearby table so my father (who walks with a walker) wouldn't have far to go. So many restaurants do not take this into consideration, so when they do, I am immediately grateful. Our server was very knowledgeable and pleasant.

4.0,1/7/2017,"Impromptu date night! After meeting up after work, we decided to have a sit down dinner rather than the bar fare that I was anticipating. Luckily, we were in the area and they had availability. Everything was perfect! Yes- I said perfect. The drinks: Do yourself a favor and order a bottle if you and your dining partner have a combined appetite for atleast 3 drinks. It just makes economical sense. The food: We ordered steaks and atleast 4 sides, which was more than we needed, but absolutely delicious. Ambiance: When you enter and realize that you'll be going below ground, you may initially think that it will feel like a dungeon. this is totally not the case. the lighting gives it the appearance of being open, while still intimate enough for a date or formal enough for a work dinner. Sealing the deal: The service hear is stellar and is consistently stellar. The waiter was filled recommendations and knowledge that can only be developed when you truly understand the meal options and the establishment. You are made to feel as though they honestly want you to dine there and this is not always the case at other restaurants.",2,1,3,Nyota W.,"Brooklyn, NY",317,710,124

3.0,12/29/2016,"I have two experiences of this restaurant from my stay in the hotel it is attached to, so this review is a combination of those two experiences.  I came in on Dec 26th which was a holiday this year.  I called down first to ask about getting dessert delivered to my room, but after hearing that none of the desserts with gelato (which were almost all of them) could have the gelato because it would melt before arriving, I decided to come down the restaurant and told the girl on the phone that.  She did NOT mention that they were closing in a few minutes and that I should hurry, so when I arrived 10 minutes later, the sign was out saying they were closed.  I talked to a waiter who said that because I just wanted dessert, they would take me.  (Good call on his part.)The dessert that night was divine (the chocolate cake with the amaretto soaked cherries!)  The next day we decided to do dinner at the restaurant.  We did not have a reservation, so we needed to wait 20 minutes for our table.  (No problem, I expect that when I arrive without a reservation.)  But the hostess sent us over to the ""waiting area"" which was really just a place where they stacked chairs.  We had to unstack our own chair to be able to sit and in the ultimate of ironies, there was limited seating space because there was a table holding the owner's books entitled ""The Guest Comes First"" which clearly was NOT the case in the seating area.The hostess took us to our table which was situated in front of an open door to a function room, which if people were coming and going was going to mean that my chair would be bumped into for the entire meal.  I asked about this and said I'd rather wait for another table than be in a walk zone.  She assured me that the room was only open for improving air flow and that no one would be going into the room.  This was not true.  Evidently all of the extra dishes and silverware were being stored in this room so each time they needed to set a table, a waiter would go into the room and come out with supplies.  My chair was bumped repeatedly and I felt like I was constantly in the way.  Then there was the track lighting overhead which randomly turned on and off, making our table into a strobing light show.  When we asked about it, the wait staff informed us they were aware of the problem and that the lighting was on a circuit controlled by the hotel and no one knew why or when it would turn on and off and that they couldn't fix it.  (I know a good electrician who COULD fix it - they clearly just don't think it's a priority.)  It was not an ideal environment for enjoying the meal.  The food was good (not great) and the service was good.  But the environment made it difficult to truly appreciate the meal.  I'd skip it.  There are better places in NYC.UPDATE:  To Davio's credit, the manager reached out to me after reading this review and checking my facts with his staff. He admitted that they dropped the ball with me and offered to comp me and a friend for dinner at a future date of my choice.  I don't make it to NYC often, but I'll definitely make a point to take him up on the offer and post a review again.",0,1,0,Kelle S.,"Cambridge, MA",542,17,0

It's not until, you enter the building and go down to the restaurant that you're transported into a romantic and elegant BUT casual setting. The location is small and intimate. They have a bar which you can sit at with TVs for the sport viewers.They have a menu with various delicious looking choices.  They also have a prefix menu ($45) with three options for appetizers, entree, and dessert.  Since it was my first time here, I did the prefix, which had great options and made it easier to choose what I wanted.  For my appetizer, I had the mixed greens with beets and beet dressing.  The dressing quantity was perfect, not overly drenched and not too dry.  Let's just say it's the first time I've never left a leaf on my plate!For my entree, I had the branzino with spinach and cream, with roasted potatoes. The fish was perfectly proportioned and cooked to perfection, with enough crispness on the outside while tender and juicy on the inside.  It was then folded over with the spinach and cream stuffed inside.  The potatoes, perfectly seasoned and baked with a crispness on the outside as if they were pan seared afterwards.  Lastly, dessert was good, I can't remember what it was called, but it was a pie with vanilla I cream. The only con is I wish they would have added a little more ice cream to offset all the sweetness going on.They have a vast selection of wines by the bottle. Not a very large selection by the glass but enough to satisfy you.  I had the Riesling which was very good.The staff and service was excellent!!

The flavor combination was so interesting, with tuna, ginger, lotus root, avocado, and hajiki (seaweed salad). My wife had the tagliatelle with bolognese and I had the 16oz ribeye. Both were excellent and the portions were quite generous for the price.Lastly, their house Cabernet is very good and compliments the meat nicely. There is a nice dark berry (currant, blueberry) nose, followed by a velvety and chocolate-y taste and is smooth going down. Hints of spice give it some life.

I persisted and she reluctantly moved us to the middle of the floor. When we left at 1:15, the restaurant was only half full.

First of all: service is top notch.  They are knowledgable about the food, and provide excellent recommendations based on what you want to eat.  The chef also provides complimentary desserts and appetizers, which I find rare in a more upscale restaurant. My boyfriend got the surf and turf special, and there is only one word to describe his meal: decadent.  His burger was piled with chunks of fresh lobster meat, with truffle shavings folded into the burger.  His fries were drenched in truffle oil, and it was absolutely delicious.  His portion size was also very generous: my boyfriend's stomach is a bottomless pit, but even he couldn't finish the fries after devouring his burger. I got the Linguini, clams, tomatoes, parsley, lemon, and olive oil, which I would absolutely recommend.  Like my boyfriend's meal, my portion was very generous.  The pastas are handmade on site, and you can really taste the difference.  It was the perfect amount of creamy and refreshing, and no flavor overpowered one or the other.

Being a Sunday night, the restaurant was welcomingly quiet, but I'm assuming it gets considerably busier during the previous two nights, or weekday lunches, etc.  The steak I ordered ( a 10 oz filet, at medium+ ) was done perfectly, and thoroughly delicious.  We ordered a few sides as well, and they were equally good ( each seemed large enough for 2-3 people ).  All-around, the service was great, and our server, Andres, was exceptional; among the best I've ever had.Make no mistake, this place is very deserving of the term ""high-end restaurant"", but the prices are not outrageous....they're quite fair for what you'll get.  With so many restaurants in Manhattan, it's hard to eat at the same place twice, but I'd definitely go back again.",1,0,0,Jim H.,"Philadelphia, PA",1,122,0

I swear I had five different people speak with me and serve me and everyone was on the the same page. It was kind of crazy. I wish our drinks came out faster, but granted they were mobbed and it was Valentines Day. The Spanish Octopus was not good, at all. My girlfriend got six raviolis in an unbalanced sauce.

I have a lot of food allergies, all require strict adherence.  This is my 3rd time here and every time they get it right.  Not only that, but they make wise decisions on substitutions to avoid ingredients my body can't have.  In fact, they have a special gluten free menu.  So for anyone avoiding gluten I highly recommend this restaurant.  Lastly, the quality of the food was tops.  I had the chicken dish.  Simply excellent.   The portion was generous which is important for me as I have a pretty healthy appetite.

The hostesses were super friendly and kind and really set the tone for an excellent evening.Our waiter came over immediately and brought us water which he refilled multiple times throughout the evening withour ever being asked.We ordered the prix fixe menu which included an app, entree, and dessert for $39 each - not a bad deal at all!  For an appetizer I ordered the pea soup with creme fresh and bacon.  We were brought a special appetizer (free of charge) from the chef which was butternut squash soup which was perfection. The plating was top notch as was the taste. We were also brought deliciously fresh and crunchy rolls. We ordered two glasses of wine each and they brought us a wine glass and individually decantered wine which they poured into our glasses for us.The pea soup was a great consistency and had subtle flavors which were enhanced by the creme fresh.  In between our appetizers and entrees, they came and wiped crumbs off the table and changed out the silverware. I very much felt as though I were royalty,  that's how good the service is. Next came the steak. My mouth is watering just thinking about how good that steak was. I order mine medium rare and this was truly cooked to perfection.  I want that steak to be my last meal on earth so I can die elated.Lastly came dessert. We both ordered flourless chocolate cake which came with banana gelato and something akin to bananas foster on top. The combination of flavor was perfect - the banana was not overpowering and rather complemented the cake. We were not rushed at all, and treated exceptionally well. My compliments to the staff, the chefs, and management for an incredibly well done job.",0,1,0,Rachel W.,"New York, NY",64,104,14

3.0,1/9/2016,"The service here was absolutely exceptional. Unfortunately I was less than impressed with the food. We came for my friends birthday and all of us were pretty disappointed. For an appetizer we had the sausage on toast. It was ok but nothing to get excited about especially since the toast was kind of burnt. All three of us ordered the 8oz filet mignon and three sides to share (mashed potatoes, creamed spinach, & onion rings). The sides were good, but again I don't really know how you could mess those things up. The filet was so disappointing. One of my friends steak was much smaller than the other two. It was very noticeable and didn't make sense because we all ordered the 8oz. The meat was incredibly dry and had no flavor. All of us only had a few bites and were totally over it.

3.0,1/4/2016,"Located in Midtown East, this seems like a businessman/woman and tourist spot located next to all the hotels and offices in the area.  The atmosphere is more upscale and located in the basement of the hotel but still is well lit and you don't feel as if you are in the basement.Getting to the food, we tried a mix of the spring rolls (chicken parm, shrimp, buffalo chicken) to start, all of which were ok in flavors.  For my main, I tried the seared Mediterranean Branzino, that was served with acorn squash, shrimp stuffed peppers and had a piquillo sauce on the bottom (the fish skin was a bit soggy and not crunchy so the dish overall seemed to lack any texture as the sides were all soft as well).Overall, the service was a bit spotty but friendly and the food was ok.  If I come back, I would definitely like to try other things on the menu as some of the other dishes (pasta and meat) seemed to be the way to go here (shock as you look at the name of the place).  I am not sure what the price-point per person came out to be, but I would guess it was close to $70 or so after a drink and tax/tip for lunch.Buon appetito.",0,1,0,Marco M.,"Manhattan, NY",447,503,263

4.0,12/30/2015,"Davios is a great surprise. This is a true steakhouse deserving inclusion among the better restaurants in Manhattan. Steak was simple, unadorned top-qualty meat and the service was impeccable and easy. From the time we entered, we asked for small considerations: to transfer our cocktail bill from the bar to our table; to provide us with a quiet table (at prime time on a Saturday, the night after Christmas); to seat us without a reservation -though the restaurant was mostly full; and various small requests throughout dinner. In each instance, Davios' staff were truly accommodating. I never heard 'no' and there was never a hesitation. This was fine dining:  courses of the meal arrived appropriately, after we had finished the one prior, with only a short pause between courses.When I enter a restaurant that calls itself a steakhouse, my first concern is the quality of the meat. I am a simple man, and steak is a primary concern. (Actually, I had the special on Saturday, which was a double prime rib -not technically a steak). This beef (which it is, in any case), was excellent. I cannot say whether it was dry aged or prime, but it tasted so. The place is worth checking out just for the beef: I would like to 'hear' others perspectives on this and the other cuts offered. I would prefer they offered a porterhouse also.My wife had a coruscating pasta, a ravioli with butternut squash. The pasta was a very thin, almost diaphanous soft pillow for the flavorful squash that made each bite quite delectable. She loves pasta and I agree this was worthy of a classic Italian cucina. I started with main courses, because... well these matter most. But the appetizers were also worthy. Her arugula salad was delicious, understated but also piquant, and plated well. Perhaps a bit more mushroom would have worked well as a counterpoise to the arugula and lemon. My crispy chicken livers were brilliant tasty savories -and original from my standpoint. I love good popovers, which were the bread of the meal.We went light on dessert and split a sorbet. I cannot overstate that the waiter and staff were extremely appropriate. They took the cue from us, both in service and in repartee. Couldn't have been happier here, either.",1,0,0,Steve O.,"New York, NY",7,87,4

We got there early and were immediately seated. Rather than just dropping a dirty glass on your table with warm water, they ask you what kind of water you'd like, that's a nice touch. I do not speak Italian, so I was a little confused about the sections on the menu, but our waiter explained it all to me. Even after that I still had a little bit of trouble. We ordered a spring roll sampler for our appetizer which was absolutely amazing! My favorite was the Reuben. I ordered the Bolognese with the Braised Veal, Beef, and Pork for my main. I liked it but I was not completely blown away. My boyfriend had the rib eye with fries, mashed potatoes and something else that I could not quite remember but his report on the steak, fries and mash were a thumbs up... The other thing not so yummy. It was similar to grits, maybe it was grits lol. Throughout the night I was sipping on pinot Grigio that my boyfriend ordered, I really like that as well. The brand they use was very tasteful.We topped it off with warm chocolate cake dessert which tasted great! It was kinda like the one from Dominos (the pizza company). Overall I had a great experience and would come back again, but only for a special occasion. It was also brought to my attention that they have weekday happy hour with $6 glasses of wine and free appetizers, I will definitely check that out!",3,1,2,Bria A.,"Crown Heights, Brooklyn, NY",78,59,32

I'd recommend this place for a romantic date or a business meal. The service was excellent as well: all waiters/waitresses were polite and serviced each table for more efficiency overall. They started us off with bread rolls, which came out soon after we sat down and were delicious! They have a nice crispy texture on the outside with a soft, chewy core.

Free amouge busche- either a salmon cake or roasted beet skewer. These were both delicious bites. The spicy sausage app is a little oily but perfectly cooked. The pumpkin cheesecake over a pistachio crumble cookie was that perfect meeting of sweet and savory (though I wasn't a fan of the masala whipped cream). Not-so-good: the ""spicy"" broccoli rabe was bland and couldn't even be called mild. The truffle polenta was salty and heavy on the truffles.

I came here for a birthday dinner for 10 and I can say, not only was the food A+ (on flavor, portions, and value) but the service was A++ and our wait staff did everything they could to make it a wonderful celebration from start to end.Food - this place first of all, has great bread that they provide in generous portions as the table is seated. Notably, they have hot popovers which tastes great with the two types of butter they serve. Then dinner-wise, they offer a super good value prix fixe in addition to a multitude of other dishes that cater to all sorts of palettes/dietary restrictions.

Their desserts - which are displayed upfront on a movable trolley - are SUPER delicious come in great variety if you order the platter. The donuts are also amazing.Ambiance - overall seemed nice; our seating was especially awesome as they had a rectangular table that comfortably seated a party of 10 and it was tucked towards the back such that we had enough space and privacy.The restaurant also has high ceilings.Service - really nicely done job here. We had multiple servers take care of us and they were clearly very keen on making sure that we had a good time.

Tasted  akin to a deconstructed pizza. Main course was spaghetti with cheese and pepper. The pasta was slightly overcooked but it was still good. For desert, chocolate mousse with almond gelato. It was the best part of the meal. The meal also included whitefish hors d'oeuvres before the appetizer and Italian candies after desert as extras.The Service: The hostess was very friendly (took our coats).

First, they sat us at a booth that was between the dining room and the bar, but there was a cold draft from the doors, and we were both shivering - and we had dinner at 5:30, when the restaurant was wide open - yet they give us the crummiest seats in the house and we didn't notice until it was too late and too much of a hassle to change.Then, the food was awful. The salad was almost inedible and the pasta dish with braised lamb was almost inedible as well. The pasta was overcooked and I just did not like it.It might be a good restaurant during non-restaurant weeks, but during restaurant ""week"" they really let the quality slide. Very disappointed.

Next, we were charged for multiple things that were never brought to the table.  they cleared or attempted to clear our food while we were clearly still eating with every course. Lastly, we had multiple waiters the guy who spoke Spanish  and the original old POS who was too good to care about our table. I've been a server in the past and always leave 20%, but this made me want to leave no tip. When our bill came it was 1300+ for 12 ppl which is fine except for the fact that we had terrible service.  When the manager was informed nothing was done. I would not recommend this place to anyone.

I have to admit it sounded great, but it tasted and smelled even better.  The toasted bread given with the dish topped it off. The two entrees that we ordered was the same dish that the server recommended.  We both got the 12 oz. center cut filet mignon.  The only con was that the server got our filet mixed up. One was juicer than it should've been. For the side, we ordered the roasted romenasco, shallots, chestnuts and acorn squash.  I must say this goes well with the entree that we ordered.

5.0,1/7/2015,"Phenomenal meal, one of the best I've had in the city in a while. The service was simply outstanding. Very attentive without ever feeling crowded or rushed, and with no awkward hovering. A lot of restaurants will slack on quality of service to move more tables or after a few good reviews ups their popularity, but this place felt welcoming and genuine.We were seated quickly, and our server was prompt about explaining the menu and getting us drinks. A bread basket came out almost right away without prompting (which was good, since we were starving). The bread itself was fantastic with good variety and a nice array of butter, eggplant spread, and some vegetables.The food was excellent and a reminder of how big a gap there is between good Italian food and *great* Italian food. We had the American Kobe meatballs as an appetizer. Excellent, very big, tender and flavorful, not too heavy or greasy, well sauced. Could probably have stood to be a tiny bit denser and chewier, but given the size of our entrees it might be better that they were not.Afterwards we were given complimentary salmon croquettes which were amazing.For my entree I had the tagliatelle bolognese. It was perfect. Well portioned, beautifully presented, a rich and meaty sauce that was nuanced enough to carry complex flavors, and the pasta was tender and perfectly done.I don't know what our dessert was called, but it was like donut holes and churros had a love-child that turned out to be a prodigy. They were cinnamon and sugar dusted bites with a small cup of hot chocolate with home made marshmallows to dip.They also brought us small bites of peppermint bark (phenomenal chocolate used) and strawberry candy with the bill.I didn't try any of their drinks, because I was fighting a bad cold, but this is definitely a place I'll return to again. I had to talk myself out of going back the following night. :-)On price: this place isn't inexpensive (though not bad compared to several nearby restaurants that aren't half as good), but it's worth every penny for a wonderful meal and experience.",2,0,0,Vijay P.,"Reston, VA",2,5,0

5.0,12/9/2014,"This restaurant is phenomenal.I had relatives come into town who had dined at one of Steve DiFillipo's other steakhouses in Boston and invited me to have dinner with them. They had an incredible experience at the Boston restaurant and were excited to try the Manhattan installment of Davio's.First, the decor was very pleasant. The dining room was completely full, but not too loud and still felt very intimate. We took a seat across from the open kitchen, which turned out to be really interesting. I enjoyed the transparency offered by the open kitchen, where we could see the dining staff at work and the wood burning oven in all of its glory.Next, the waiter we had was very friendly. He gave us plenty of time to read the menu and enjoy the excellent selection of breads with the various sauces. My glass of water was never empty, and the food came out in a very timely manner.The food was incredible from start to finish. As I mentioned before, the bread basket was full of different fresh slices, the only one of which I didn't enjoy being the whole wheat olive bread, where the olives slightly overpowered the bread and the sauces. After placing our order, our server brought out salmon croquets in an incredible chipotle aioli compliments of the chef. The salmon was cooked perfectly, still hot within the crispy breaded outer layer with an inner texture smoother than a crab cake and bursting with flavor. Our main dishes were brought out soon after, of which I had the prime ribeye, medium rare. The crust was light, and the inside grilled to perfection with the ideal tenderness and balance of flavor throughout the steak. With a thick house sauce poured over the top and mashed garlic spread over the meat, each bite was a piece of heaven. I never had a bite that was too tough or overcooked, nor any that tasted burnt or overworked in any way. The garlic mashed potatoes went very well with the steak without overwhelming you with the garlic or buttery flavor. I had some of my aunt's lobster pasta, where the lobster tasted slightly overcooked but was balanced well within the pasta's red sauce. It was a light dish that was very satisfying, but not what I would personally recommend as I believe there are other options on the menu that speak more to the skill and unique flavors created by chef DiFillipo.Finally, the elaborate dessert cart was wheeled out in front of us with more offerings than we could take in at the moment. I went for the most visually pleasing, the chocolate mousse adourned with caramel ice cream, dark chocolate cake, a citrus meringue-like puff, and crunchy bits of chocolate. The mousse tasted as stunning as it looked, especially paired with the citrus and the salty caramel ice cream. I felt as if the crunchy cholate pieces may have been uneccesary, as they grew old towards the end of the dish.Overall, my experience at Davio's was one of the best I have ever had at any restaurant: exceptional food, service, and ambience. The only deterrent would be the obvious: price. This was by no means a cheap meal (or in my opinion, no means an affordable meal had I not been taken by my generous relatives), but definitely delivered on the luxury that you were paying for. Davio's set a new standard on steaks for me that will keep me waiting until I return (perhaps after several years of mortgaging a house and selling off my dearest possesions).",0,0,0,Justin U.,"New York, NY",8,9,4

5.0,11/20/2014,"I will dream frequently of the meal we had until my next visit, which I hope will happen very soon (we already have plans to return for my birthday next summer).My dining companion and I are experienced, knowledgeable, yet fair diners. Between the two of us, we have traveled to a large portion of the globe. We both agreed that this was one of the best meals we've had in a very long time. I personally rank this as the single best meal I've ever had in NYC, and among my top five internationally. Service was outstanding across the board. Management was beyond accommodating. The open kitchen is impeccably clean. All staff communicate respectfully as they seamlessly execution of near perfect dining experience.Chef Brown personally greeted our table various times throughout the meal. Firm handshake, genuine eye contact, personable, charming, and truly invested in our overall experience, down to adjusting the tasting and plating to suit our individual levels of hunger.The specialty cocktails were perfect in presentation, portion, strength, composition, bouquet, and finish. I was intrigued in a good way that they presented the Pinot Noir in miniature decanters rather than bottle presentation. It was poured slightly chilled, which brought out more of its smokey nature. As it came to room temperature, more of the floral aspects were present. It was an enjoyable vintage at all temperatures, which solidified our trust in the Sommelier.Every food course had its own merits of excellence:Opening Amuse Bouche and bread basket: perfectly pickled spouts, the most delish butter, wonderful aioli, and every option in the bread basket was lovely, with the rosemary focaccia taking the prize, both when paired with butter and the aioli.La Lavanda was a perfect balance of lavender and spirits. I could have ordered one simply to sniff throughout the night, and still have been in heaven. The Great Pumpkin was unique in its well-executed use of cardamom.I've always boycotted foie gras due to the way it is made. One taste of Chef Brown's presentation forced me to end my boycott. The dish offered the added perfection of duck prosciutto and roasted chestnuts...and the celery root puree?? I had to close my eyes to properly respect and savor. Gorgeous.The Beet Salad was a lovely presentation. I do not like beets, but it was one of few preparations of the vegetable which didn't offend my palate. My dining companion, who loves beets though rarely offers to finish my leftovers, assured me that my uneaten portion would not go to waste! The hazelnut-crust Gorgonzola, however, was lusciously RIGHT up my alley!The grilled octopus dish is only second best to that which I've had prepared by ancient Greek grandmothers dressed all in black...and it still gave their dishes a run for their money.The clam linguini was the only dish where the ingredients, when tasted individually, did not impress....but this was because they were meant to be wed in a perfect bite. That marriage was pure gold.The Caramelle dish was so divine that we both put our hands to our chests at first bite. And we had no shame in lapping up every drop of the silky butter sauce.I've never had better endive or more perfectly cooked scallops. As you'll see, two pictures were necessary!Chef Brown has made me rethink the possibilities of a New York Strip (usually my least favorite cut). Perfectly crusted, perfect temperature, perfect accoutrements. I could not leave one bite on the plate.The single best molten chocolate cake I have ever enjoyed.  Brilliant pairing with the burnt orange garnish.The panna cotta offered a lovely textural play. Creamy, crunchy, and that phenomenal burst of the gooseberry. I devoured this by the glutenous spoonful.As if the spiced red wine ice cream atop chocolate dust wasn't perfection enough, the Greek yogurt ""cheesecake"" paired with the poached pears couldn't have offered a more perfect end to a more perfect meal.We were stuffed...yet couldn't refuse the finishing amuse bouche, in all of its tiny perfection.Do yourself the service of making a reservation immediately. Book your company breakfasts/lunches/dinners/events here, whether in their dining room, or on the year-round roof top. Take your out-of-town visitors. Make a reason to go frequently. Simply put: Do NOT miss out on the amazing culinary artistry that Davio's and Chef Brown have to offer.",5,0,4,Christopher M.,"New York, NY",1591,1629,394

It also happens to be a block away from my office, and I have walked by it every single day but never stopped by. The service was incredible- when I got to the restaurant I was starving, and the waiter was super attentive about refilling our bread basket and gave us all a cheese ball appetizer on the house. Davio's Riesling was sweet and flavorful, just how I like it. I also loved the beet salad and prosciutto ravioli I got for my appetizer and entree. The presentation of this food is beautiful! Some others in the party got the gnocchi and the scallops, and we all loved our meals.When they were clearing the table, the waiter accidentally spilled olive oil on the back of my shirt and coat. Normally I am not too high maintenance about this stuff, but it was a silk shirt so I had to rush to the bathroom to clean it promptly. Michael, the manager felt bad about this and offered to cover my dry cleaning bill, which was extremely generous. On top of that, they surprised us with 5 free desserts on the house!

The waiter failed to introduce himself, was abrupt, unapologetic (I was brought the wrong entrée and had to wait while my husband enjoyed his), and failed to check up on us.Food: Average at best.-- Spaghetti - My husband ordered this dish and it was slightly better than the pasta I make at home. Since my pasta involves a box of Barilla and Whole Foods marinara, this isn't saying much.-- Salmon - This was fine, a bit on the greasy side. What troubled me more, however, was the tiny portion size and very little of the accompanying root vegetables. For the price this was very disappointing.-- Molten Lava Cake - The cake was good but cold in the center so not very molten-y. For $12 I would have appreciated a bit more ice cream as well...one tiny teaspoon didn't quite do the trick. My husband demolished the entire thing.Prices: Ridiculously high.Overall: I had high hopes for Davio's but have no plans to return to this mediocre restaurant.

The octopus was soft and not overly chewy like octopus can sometimes be. It came with these artichokes that were a bit on oily side but overall this dish was very tasty.

5.0,9/16/2014,"Shared the 30 oz ribeye long bone steak with my love.  It was done medium as the waiter advised that medium rare was cooked more near rare, plus this was a thick steak.  It was right on and excellent.  This is a pretty nice place and the steak was around $56 but it was sooooo good, i couldnt resist picking up the bone and gnawing off the last of the tasty meat.  (Boyfriend is writing, in case you were picturing a girl with a steak bone).  Ordered some mashed potatoes and asparagus as sides and they were both good but a little small.  House red wine was good except for the one the wait staff accidentally knocked in my lap.  Luckily my black shirt and jeans made it through fine after a wash.  Friends had a fish dish and a pork dish.  Seemed the pork dish was a bit too spicy as had a spicy sauce on top of some peppercorn seasoning.  We had two dessert specials that were chocolatey items.  One was a platter of  various items with edible gold specks.  The platter had interesting bits, but the other dessert we had, a chocolate lava cake, was just plain good.  Also the surprise extra dark chocolate pieces given as a salutation left a nice taste.  Ambiance was nice for a romantic date but be forewarned you are actually dining below ground level so there is no view other then a mirror with drapes pretending to be a window at night.  But that might make the experience that much better as you dont get distracted by the outside world.  Steak was exactly what we were hankering for and thats why the 5 stars despite the lap wine.",0,0,0,Anita C.,"Pompano Beach, FL",14,86,25
4.0,9/14/2014,"Mad late Restaurant Week review.. lolThis was my 3nd restaurant and 2nd steakhouse for restaurant week 2014. Interior ambiance was upscale and very warm and inviting. Dim lighting, comfortable seating in booths. Staff was attentive and not intrusive at all, and quite knowledgeable about the menu. For apps, I had a minestrone soup with their complimentary bread; the combo was delicious! For entree, I had a hangar steak, which I asked to be cooked medium rare. Though when it came, it looked rarer than I'm used to, but I didn't send it back. Nice and juicy steak, I devoured it! Loll And dessert, I had a chocolate mousse w/ Mint Gelato, which had just the right touch of sweetness, not overly done. And I had a glass of Marchione Moscato, which is sweet and smooth.

Well, let's just say that I had to hibernate in the restroom after coming home... Everyone else was fine though. What I love about davio's is that they seat you even if everyone's not there yet. I made  a reservation at 7:30pm for a group of 6 (restaurant week) one of the couple arrived at 7:25 and were seated right away while they waited for everyone else to arrive which wasn't until 7:37pm. I don't know about you guys but that was pretty awesome. Most places will ask for you to wait until everyone arrives before seating you. I started off with the minestrone soup, delish! Then I had the steak which is where the -.5 came in. I don't know about you but I like to talk while eating... Well, not simultaneously. When I took the first bite, yummy! But after working on it for 15 min it started getting a little dry and tough. The other -.5 would be from the dessert. I got the lychee sorbetti... Umm, avoid that at all cost unless you like overly sweet desserts.Everyone got a small complementary starter. Which was a nice touch as well. The bill came out to $402 for 6 people including a $85 bottle of wine + tip and tax. Excluding tip would be around $340-$341.

Topped off the meal with a cappucino and chocolate mousse that was delicious and light. Overall, it was a lovely experience and I have no complaints.  I did not have the bread that was placed on the table because I follow a gluten free diet but apparently it was delicious.

Yes, it's that good, especially without the port balsamic glaze, in which the alcohol overwhelmed the sweetness of the balsamic.  I had a scallop dish that was supposed to include white asparagus spears; it did not.  It was good otherwise, but I didn't much care for the generic sweet sauce that was supposed to be apricot.  The filet mignon was good, but not remarkably good.  Skip the bread. If the little ""taste from the pastry chef""  is any indication of the quality of the dessert, I would skip dessert as well.

It was ok, I wouldn't order again.  The food is clean, and they provide large servings.  They have a dessert cart which gets rolled out to tempt you.This restaurant has an extensive menu, which includes pizza and burgers.  The food was not spectacular and did not meet my high expectations.  I would rather they have a limited menu with items that are all prepared well, than a bunch of mediocre dishes.  Even if the portions were small, I don't care so long as it's delicious.I'm not sure if I would return to this restaurant again.  I prefer the food over at Capital Grille in the Chrysler building, even though their level of service is lacking.  This is a place I would take clients, but for enjoyment of the food, there seems to be plenty of other places nearby.",2,1,0,Carlos S.,"FOREST HILLS, NY",0,147,0

I booked a business lunch for five. When we were seated , our table was right next to another group of five having lunch. The entire restaurant was empty and we could not help but hear their entire sales pitch.  This time they added a prix fixe menu. We thought it was a great addition until we actually got our entrees. Very very small portions. Three ordered salmon and they had to be sent back as they were raw in the middle. Cannot see how anyone could find this lunch filling.

We had no less than 8 different waiters, managers, sommeliers and busboys come up to us about every minute or so to ask if we were ready to order, if everything was ok, to explain the bread accoutrements, to try to clear our still half-full appetizer plate, etc.  While attentiveness is definitely appreciated,  in this case it was simply too much and the constant interruption by multiple people made it hard to have a conversation with my date.In terms of the actual meal, my filet mignon was very salty and overcooked (I asked for medium, but it was not pink at all) and the spinach side was overdone as well.  Also, I almost always order dessert but everything on the cart they brought out looked dry and unappetizing.  In a city full of delicious (and cheaper) steakhouses, I will probably go elsewhere for my money.  I would, however, potentially go back to the bar for their trademark spring rolls.   While they are not on the dinner menu, they let us order as an appetizer.  The Philly Cheesesteak rolls are a can't miss.  Everything else, however, at this point, sadly is.",1,0,0,Elizabeth F.,"New York, NY",0,1,0
