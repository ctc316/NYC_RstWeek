1.0,5/1/2019,"This place is an insult to Indian food. Everything felt so forced to make an Indian dish modern. In doing so , taste and texture were both sacrificed. Indian food is so wholesome and flavorful. It looks like Junoon doesn't cater to the individual but are just obsessed with the Michelin star. This being said, I do hope everyone tries Junoon at least once. It is good to acknowledge an attempt at uplifting the flavors of India.Innovation in Menu - 1 star Taste - 2 stars(only because of the sponge cake) Ambience- 5 starsService -2 stars ( maybe I should have worn better clothes, and I would have been treated better)",0,0,0,Ab G.,"Cupertino, CA",0,4,17
5.0,4/28/2019,"We tried the tasting menu, which really stuffed us. There were many courses with some amusement plate. Coming with the last entry (meat) were the rice, naan, lentil soup and some kind of yoghurt. We were surprised that the portion was so huge. The food was delicate and the taste was great. There was a very spicy green sauce. I mentioned it to the waitress and she gave us a msngo lasse on house. We like the lobster the best. The curry with it was delicious. We came here for my husband's birthday. We were given a birthday cake on house. In all, that's a lot of kinds of food to eat with a reasonable price and good service.",0,0,0,Shirley Y.,"New York, NY",55,71,322
5.0,4/26/2019,"Had an absolutely excellent Friday night dinner here tonight with a date. Classic Michelin experience. One of our many servers was Ahmad, and he took the time to stop before our dishes even the ones he didn't bring out to make sure we understood what we were having and explained the spice and other details in the dishes. I highly recommend the 6 or 7 course tasting menu, I'm a fast eater and was here for 3 hours - and it wasn't dragged out it was well enjoyed, and the food never felt forced somehow there was always room. It was great having a Michelin experience aside from French or New American or other traditional category. I'm surprised the reviews aren't higher, I've ate at Eleven Madison Park and many other Michelin restaurants and this was definitely high up there.

4.0,4/19/2019,"This is my favorite Indian place in the city. The bar area is pretty neat and very nicely decorated.  I love the ambiance, lighting, and cleanliness. It's also very spacious, and it's great for big parties and small.The food is always delicious.  I noticed they have changed their menus a few times over the years, but they consistently have good food which is what matters.I prefer eating by the bar versus the restaurant.  I feel that the service is better, and it's more chill at the bar.  The restaurant area is more uptight, and a bit too fancy for my taste... and I'm a pretty fancy gal. The waiters in the restaurant area are not that nice and could be more professional.  I feel that's something Junoon could work on.Out of all of the Indian restaurants I've been to, (and I've been to a lot), this is still my favorite.Update:Deducted one star because trying to order takeout is a headache.  :(",0,0,0,H P.,"New York, NY",142,18,0
5.0,4/13/2019,"Had the pleasure of celebrating my birthday dinner here and was pleasantly surprised at how good the food was. I'm familiar with Indian cuisine so I knew what I was getting into. I had the 7 course tasting, which was recently updated and it was so, so good. Our waiter, Daniel, was very informative and even had the sommelier help us pick a wine that was close to my favorite. It went very well. Some highlights included a risotto-style dish with some masala spices and the ghost pepper chicken. The hara paratha (hopefully that's spelled correctly) was perfect and the desserts were creative. The ambiance was perfect for a date night and the place can get full quickly. I left very full, which is rare for a tasting menu and very pleased with the service and food. Will be returning soon to explore more on the menu, thanks to Daniel making our experience great.",0,0,0,Just B.,"Boerum Hill, NY",164,5,9
4.0,4/10/2019,Lamp shank was good but not great. Meat was cooked perfectly but a bit too spicy which kinda overwhlemed the tenderness and juiciness of lamb. Nice atmosphere. Very few people on a weekday.,0,0,0,Yilong W.,"San Francisco, CA",2,8,8
4.0,4/7/2019,"Eating at a Michelin star restaurant is on the wish list of any foodie. Being an Indian restaurant with Michelin star rating, Junoon had been on my list for 2.5 years. I feel it's not always about how good the food is; fine dining is an experience of it's own kind, meticulous detail to food presentation, uniquely crafted menu, exquisite decor combined with hospitality makes it's a memorable experience. On an extremely cold December afternoon, I headed there for Lunch with a bunch of friends. Since it was lunch time, Patiala Room is the only option available. Patiala room is ideal for a laid back experience onlooking the 24th street. There's no dress code for dining in the Patiala room.I opted for the prestige lunch prixe fixe option which is a 3 course meal. One thing I'll say is that the dishes in the menu were the first of a kind experience for me, they weren't the cliché north indian dishes you will find in restaurants.Egg plant chat was one of the best dishes !!Lal Mirch Ka Paneer was good, the combination with a sweet fig chutney tasted really good !!Paneer Pukhtan was mediocre, a little bland though for a north Indian curry.Kulfi platter had mango, paan leaf, rose petal and saffron-cardamom flavors. All of them were delicious.OverallFood : 3/5Ambience : 4:5Service : 5/5Value for money : 4/5I'll say, visit for an experience rather than having high expectations from the food.",0,0,0,Shalin P.,"NO POTOMAC, MD",0,5,0
3.0,4/6/2019,"Junoon is a pleasant experience, though having been open since 2011, has some hallmarks of a restaurant losing sharpness as the years pass. Elements of the design feel outdated relative to newcomers, and some of the staff lacked warmth and professionalism consistent with a Michelin starred venue. Our waiter and somm were notable exceptions; they were great. While the food and drink were quite enjoyable and tasty, there is a real question of value relative to other Indian restaurants in the city. The cuisine lacks a level of refinement that this price point and a Michelin star connote, particularly relative to competitors such as Indian Accent that truly elevate Indian cuisine. Would certainly consider returning to the bar area/Patiala Room for a less costly, more casual evening. Yet for true fine dining and the money, think there are better options.Atmosphere-Elements of the design are passing their prime, particularly in the main dining area, which felt more early 2000's type era.-Bar area is quite nice, design feels more up to date here. Upscale but not too formal.-Dress was generally smart casual, though plenty of people in jeans. FoodOne thing is certain: you will not go hungry. The two- or three-course options ($69-79) provide plenty of sustenance with naan, rice and daal included. Flavors are bold and there are plenty spicy options for those who like heat. Everything was very tasty, though not outstandingly memorable per se. On our visit we enjoyed:-Ghost Chili Murch Tikka (tandoor chicken thigh, pistachio sauce, braised leeks, gooseberries): VERY spicy, so for me, perfect. Nice depth of flavor, perfect on a cool day. Meat was quite moist and tender. Would order again.-Lal Mirch Ka Paneer (house made cheese, apricot chutney, apples, brulee figs): Most refinement in terms of what we ordered. The paneer was very fresh, and of lovely texture. Accompaniments were well balanced. Recommend!-Shahi Lamb Shank (black cumin yogurt curry, garam masala, potato salli): Gigantic portion, super tender but a touch dry. Flavorful and tasty, a safe, if unexciting, choice.-Lal Mas (goat meat, red chili sauce, garlic, coriander, garam masala): Straightforward, prominent red chili flavor. Not overly spicy, but with a good lingering heat. Enjoyed the smokiness.-Kulfi Pops (mango, paan leaf, rose petal, safron-cardamom): Cute presentation and a tasty, lighter option to conclude, though feels overpriced.Accompaniments (all included): Daal Makhni, Yellow Daal Tadka, Basmati Rice, Garic Naan, Za'Atar Spiced Naan, Mint Raita, Chutney TastingBeverageWe began with cocktails in the bar area, which was sparsely populated until after 7pm, making it easy to get a seat at the bar. Really enjoyed the cocktails here, and highly recommend them. Both the Mumbai Margarita (Patrón Reposado Tequila, mango purée, lime, rose-chili syrup, spiced maldon salt - $17) and El Matador (Los Siete Misterios Mezcal, lime, curry leaf jalapeño-maple syrup, turmeric tincture - $16) had unique layers of flavor and went down easy.With our dinner, we opted for the 2011 J.J. Prüm Riesling Spätlese Wehlener Sonnenuhr ($115) which was excellent against the spicy and complex food. Wine list has extensive German, Austrian and French whites that pair perfectly with the menu. In particular, many of the options are sub $125 but do not compromise on quality, which is great. Nice selection and our interactions with the somm were positive and enjoyable.Service- Our waiter and somm were professional, knowledgeable and approachable.- Somm did an excellent job discussing pairings with Indian food. She was very passionate about wine.-Sort of a mixed bag otherwise: hosts/bar area not particularly warm and hospitable, food runners did not know what was in some dishes.",0,0,0,D. L.

5.0,4/3/2019,"My first michelin star restaurant experience and I can say it did not disappoint. I was a little nervous when I saw the yelp ratings, but now I am just confused because it is soo good! It's definitely not traditional indian, but man is it delicious. It was not crowded at 8:30pm on a tuesday night so the waiters were very attentive and we were seated right away without a reservation. I did the 3 course menu and got the shrimp as the appetizer, the lamb curry thing as the entree and the pops as dessert (rose and mango were the best flavors). everything was so good! also tried the ghost chili chicken (awesome) and the lamb shank (good).

2.0,3/2/2019,"A 2 star for good service. But food was underwhelming and super overpriced. I had the shrimp appetizer and the mushroom main course. The shrimp was overcooked and served with soggy bread. The texture of the mushroom was tough and paired with a bland sauce. We also ordered the decolonized poussin dish (essentially a chicken masala dish) and the lamb main dish. The chicken dish lacked flavor in comparison to similar dishes I have had elsewhere, and the lamb was overly fatty.

5.0,2/26/2019,"Junoon is a One Michelin Star restaurant and was on my list to visit for some time. It is an upmarket restaurant serving Indian food situated close to Madison Square Park. The ambience is lit and lush and boasts of huge dining rooms and a small lit walk inside. The menu offers a variety of choices for both vegetarian and non-vegetarian but is not a lengthy list like any other Indian restaurant. The shrimp was served with unique garlic sauce lodged in pav bread, lal mirch ka paneer(cottage cheese) was balanced with apricot sauce and egg plant. A marriage of malai kofta and palak paneer was offered with kale and had just the right curry to delight the taste buds. The mock tails were also unique in flavor and presentation. Passion fruit jaljeera was served in mini bottles tucked in ice buckets and the sunflower saffron mocktail was great. The choices for dessert were also nicely picked. Our kulfi pops had just the right flavor and innovation both in taste and presentation. Being upmarket, locates jn Manhattan and holding 1 Michelin star, I would say it offers food at good price and is a must visit when in NYC.

5.0,2/16/2019,"Junoon has been on my list for a while, so I jumped when a reservation came up for my last trip to NYC. I dined with a colleague in the Patiala Room. Here are the highlights:-Quinoa chaat: This dish was relatively unremarkable for me. -Ghost chili murgh tikka: The ghost pepper doesn't kick in for a moment, but then you feel it! I really enjoy spicy foods and enjoyed that this chicken dish was hot but still flavorful. It didn't lose its identity in the spice. -3 lentil shorba: I was not sure how well I would like this dish, but I enjoyed the combination of the picked onion with the brighter vegetables. -Telicherry Duck: I'm a sucker for ordering duck, and this peppercorn sauce was excellent. Not sure if I have ever had duck in a curry before, and this one was a great first experience of it. -Lamb chops: The lamb chops were HUGE! I was surprised to see such a substantial portion size, but fortunately, the dish size was matched with flavor. -Kulfi pops: My favorite! If I remember correctly, the flavors were mango, rose petal, saffron, and then a fourth. The mango one was delicious, the rose petal was soft and understated but certainly enjoyable, and I must admit the saffron pop was a little much for me. The service was top-notch.

4.0,2/13/2019,"Inventive, exotic and culturally embracing. Junoon is in a realm of its own in United States, inventive takes on Indian classics and questioning the traditions of food to bring something new. I think several dishes here can become staples that survive and become a part of American Indian food for decades to come. The place is uniquely New York, as a restaurant like this would have a tough time surviving in most other cities.The tasting menu for lunch is deeply discounted, so  keep that in mind when making a reservation and choosing a time. For appetizer, had eggplant chaat, ghost chili murgh tikka and five pepper scallop. All of them were delicious and don't know if I can pick a favorite. Continued to the main course Lal Mas, a goat stew. The dish was prepared very well, the goat very tender and the meat flavorful. It was a fairly traditional goat preparation, so it did not have any surprise element to it, but it was one of the best preparations I've had. From desserts, the drunken shahi tukra was hands down the best. Saffron cake, with rum and cardamom, it was balanced in sweetness and delicious. Ma's Rice pudding was quite good as well. I often do not like Indian desserts as a matter of taste due to extremely high sugar levels, but the ones here were amazing.Service was generally good, but there were a couple mishaps that I find unacceptable in a restaurant within this price range. All three wine glasses were brought out full of lint inside, suggesting they were polished with a regular towel instead of a microfiber cloth, leaving a ton of cotton residue on the inside of the glass. I didn't bother returning, but cleaned myself. I can't recall ever encountering this in a restaurant, particularly at this price point. Another odd thing was that two different people came around asking us if we wanted dessert when we informed our waitress at the very beginning which desserts we wanted. They were very kind to bring us a complimentary extra dessert for the long wait.Junoon is a must in NYC, it holds its own when it comes to creativity and ability to take centuries of tradition to create something new.",7,3,7,Alex P.,"Atlanta, GA",534,930,2154

I eventually went back to the same hostess and asked when we would be seated, and she had no recollection of talking to us before and couldn't find our reservation.Eventually we were seated and ended up getting the tasting menu. Unfortunately that night they had switched to a new menu, so overthing we were looking forward to that we had seen online was no linger there. The menu was pretty bland overall, the only things standing out were the dessert (delicious), and the scallop (insanely spicy).For a Michelin star resturant I was very disappointed in the reception service and the tasting menu.

The tikka was on the spicy side, however you can request to lower the spice level. Very juicy and tender but more on the fusion side. Second course, we got the shrimp curry and tandoori chicken. The shrimp curry tasted like masaman curry with a slight kick, def not Indian style, more like Thai style. The chicken was very typical grilled white meat chicken. Both dishes came with naan and rice. For desserts, we got a complementary dessert. We ordered the rice pudding and Kulfi Trio. Both were decent desserts that wasn't too sweet. Overall, great service.

3.0,1/29/2019,"Came here for dinner over restaurant week. Beautiful restaurant and excellent service, with interesting dishes some better executed than others. We started with a drink for the mocktail menu. It was served in four small bottles which was a charming touch.

We were very impressed with how thoughtful and extensive the mocktail menu is. We ordered the eggplant chat and the ghost chili tikka for our apps. The eggplant chaat was a nice combination of flavors and the eggplant was perfectly fried, the tikka was delicious very spicy (as the name implies) and perfectly cooked. The chicken was incredibly tender but still nicely browned and the gooseberries and leeks helped cut the spice. For our entrees we ordered the shrimp curry and the eggplant. The shrimp curry was tasty, the eggplant dish was not as much of a standout for us. The naan, as some other reviewers have mentioned, is delicious and a nice portion came with our meal however any more is extra. For dessert we had the kulfi sampler and the rice pudding. The rice pudding was well spiced and had a delightful texture, with the candied almonds providing a nice crunch. However, I'm not sure I would pay the regular price for it. The kulfi was extraordinary. The rose was by far our favorite but we enjoyed all the flavors (the betel leaf was a surprise and a creative homage to India) and the dessert is beautifully presented. It was my friend's birthday and they were gracious enough to give us a lovely chocolate mousse. Overall, I would probably not return. For Indian at this price point Tamarind is still my go to. But if you order the right dishes this is a lovely restaurant.",0,0,0,Nicole B.,"New York, NY",226,142,4
2.0,1/29/2019,"Came here for restaurant week and was excited that a Michelin Star was on the list as it seemed like a good deal.Tried the fried eggplant, paneer, coconut curry shrimp, the pork belly, rice pudding, and an ice cream sampler.The fried eggplant had a nice texture and reminded of fried sweet potato. Really enjoyed it, but needs to be lighter on the sauce (chutney). It was a bit too sweet.The paneer kind of just felt like blobs of cheese with no flavor. Even the sauces didn't add much there. I expected something creamy maybe, some really savory flavor, but it was just bland.The pork belly was salty, and just no other flavor with that really, maybe a little spicy.The shrimp curry was good I thought, and the curry was good with the naan. Naan was one of my favorite things, they give you so much and I'm pretty sure it's unlimited. Was it like Michelin star worthy....definitely not. The ride pudding wasn't that sweet, and just made it too bland. The ice cream was actually really interesting. There were a lot of different unique flavors, and I enjoyed that. When I first saw the yelp rating, I was like how is a Michelin star place only 3 stars on yelp. After this, I still questioned it...couldn't quite get how it's that high.",3,0,0,Victor D.,"New York, NY",20,407,732
1.0,1/27/2019,"Went to Junoon this Sunday afternoon for lunch to celebrate one of my friends Birthday.We had heard a lot about the Michelin Star restaurant and the celebrity chef associated with it.To our surprise the menu was super limited and not too many choices were available for vegetarian people.  We still went ahead and ordered a few vegetarian dishes (appetizers: egg plant chaat, paneer dish; main course: aloo methi palak, artichoke mutter veg, dal tadka, dal makhni, rice and naan bread) and when the food arrived, omg the quantity was very very very limited. The food tasted ok but considering the premium which was charged it was very mediocre. Also, the restaurant staff was very pushy and after serving the food didn't even bothered to ask for more naan bread. We also had some leftover but were not asked if we would like to have it for take out.Overall, I absolutely wouldn't recommend this restaurant as it is a waste of money. You can eat multiple times at the price of a single meal here. Also, the celebrity chef is no longer associated with this restaurant. When we asked the waiter about him, he rudely said that the celebrity chef had better things to do and hence, he is not part of Junoon anymore. Looks like Junoon's staff have no respect for the celebrity who ma the restaurant popular.I wonder how come this restaurant was awarded a michelin star.Stay away please!!!",0,0,0,T ..,"Edison, NJ",0,2,0

4.0,1/22/2019,"Junoon is exactly what you expect from Indian fine dining: homey flavors mixed with modern techniques. We got a 2 course lunch prix fixe ($25) and a 3 course prestige lunch prix fixe ($45). Appetizers: ghost chili murgh tikka (5/5) and basmati rice crusted octopus (3.5/5). The murgh tikka was hands-down the most tender chicken I have ever tasted. I was blown away by how easily I was able to cut it with only a fork, and the spice level was the perfect amount for me, despite having ""ghost chili"" in its name. The octopus was good but the texture of the entire dish was soft and monotonous. The fruits in each dish (gooseberry and citrus, respectively) were a nice attempt but did nothing to elevate the flavor of the dishes.Entrees: pork mundu chili (2/5) and lobster moilee (4/5). The waitress warned us the pork would be dry, but I didn't realize that meant there would only be pork and no vegetables or sauce at all. The pork belly consisted of 90% fat, none of which was particularly juicy or tasty, so I ended up picking out the lean portions and leaving most of it uneaten. Luckily, the lobster more than compensated in terms of sauce and flavor. The sauce was bold, flavorful, and homey, and was perfect for dipping the naan in. Only complaint was that the lobster was slightly overcooked.Dessert: drunken shahi tukra (3.5/5). I'm personally not a fan of Indian desserts but surprisingly enjoyed this one, as it was mostly savory (thanks to the cardamom) and not too sweet.Drinks: Mumbai margarita (3/5) and hot tea. I decided to be adventurous and try this sweet/spicy margarita, which was a mistake. It tasted more like a Bloody Mary, and the portion was so tiny that I couldn't believe I paid a whooping $17 for it. The tea was good, but definitely wouldn't have gotten it if I knew it cost $6!Overall, Junoon is definitely an experience worth trying, especially given the low cost of the lunch prix fixe menu. Just stick with the 2 course lunch prix fixe (make sure to order the ghost chili murgh tikka!) and be careful of their expensive drinks.",9,7,7,Jennifer F.,"Bridgewater, NJ",534,87,410
3.0,1/21/2019,"I can't give Junoon more stars because, the last time I ate there, I noticed a big decline in some things.  In fairness, this last time I went was for lunch during Summer 2018 restaurant week, so maybe they weren't on their A-game?  (Menu note:  they divided the lunch menu in half - 1/2 the regular dishes are on the RW menu and the other 1/2 of the regular dishes are on the ""Prestige"" lunch menu. It's possible to order from both sides of the menu, but they will charge the ""Prestige"" menu price if one item is from the lower RW menu.)In short, there was just enough positive to remember why Junoon used to get 1 Michelin star.  The negatives make it questionable why they still have a Michelin star.  THE PROS: the hostess, servers, and the Ghost Chili Murgh Tikka were good and almost Michelin 1-star worthy.  THE CONS:  no air-conditioning! (whaaat?) There was a very loud portable air device to pull humidity from the air in the cavernous Patiala room, but it didn't seem to work too well.  Hopefully, this was due to an AC equipment malfunction that will be corrected *quickly*.  (One way to look at it - It did make the atmosphere more authentically Indian, with heat, humidity, cooking smells, and noise).  Also disappointing, the Malabari Shrimp was seriously underwhelming, basically tasteless although the shrimp were properly cooked - a big decline from previous visits.  I've had food on planes that tasted better (sorry, Junoon).  If this was made by one of their good chefs, then this is a concerning sign of decline.  If it was made by an untrained cook, that's a warning sign that Quality Control isn't happening.  Seems that this dish wasn't checked/parts tasted before it was sent to the table.  It shouldn't have been served.  The restaurant was only 1/3 full so it seems like they had enough time to ensure the dish was properly prepared before sending it to the table.  In the future, rather than just walking over for a meal again, we'll be checking current reviews before going to Junoon again to watch whether if the decline is real and continuing or just a little bump in Junoon's road.",0,0,0,Susan H.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,4,0

5.0,1/16/2019,"Tried this place without a reservation on NYE! Call us brave or whatever, it was pouring like cats and dogs, and we thought we'll take a chance. Luck paid off, and we were able to grab a couple of seats at the bar. We took the 3 course tasting menu. But first off, we got started with drinks. Our friends had recommended the jaljeera (non alcoholic), and my wife got that, and it was so good I ordered it for my 2nd round of drinks. The presentation is impeccable, it comes in four tiny bottles inside a basket. The bartender here was one of the best I've ever seen, he made me a Indian version of a pisco sour (topped with a star anise) which was one of the best cocktails I've had in a while. For starters, I got the shrimp butter pepper garlic in a pao (a riff on a vada pao I believe and executed to perfection). My wife got the eggplant chaat, and that blew us away with its creativity (Its like a fusion version of a Bengali dish I'm very familiar with, will try this one at home). For mains, my wife got the Hara Kofta (their take on Palak Paneer, with cripsy kale and mustard greens, was delicious), and I got the Lobster Moilee (spot on in terms of flavors). At this point I was already pretty full, and was regretting not doing a 2 course tasting instead of the 3. But oh well, its NYE! For dessert we got the drunken shahi tukda (bread soaked in Amrit Rum, saffron and molasses) and the Kulfi pops (bite sized kulfis flavored as mango, paan leaf, rose petal, and saffron-cardamom, with the last one coated with Parle-G crumbs). I think it's a testament to how good the desserts were that not only did we finish them but I really liked them as well considering the fact that both these Indian desserts are actually not something I really like. I think overall the dining experience was excellent, service (hats off to the bartender again) was exemplary, and this place truly deserves its one Michelin star.

It did get a Michelin star recently so I expected better food and service but instead realized both the food and service had gone down from before. Even my friends whom I had recommended this place based on previous visit, found the food underwhelming. The staff did not seem to care much about guests either. It was not an ""experience""It's now just a pricey restaurant which serves barely Indian food. The eggplant chat was basically fried eggplant drenched in tamarind chutney. They went overboard with the tamarind chutney and it overpowered everything. The tea I ordered just came in a cup with missing teapot which they only got towards the end. The zucchini pulao was okay. The hara paneer kofta was good but it did sound hugely similar to another item on their menu.

The paneer app was basically just 3 chunks of paneer with a few bruleed barely ripe figs on the side. The Octopus app was pretty good, probably the highlight of the meal. The lamb shank entree was braised perfectly but the sauce was typical and the plate lacked any excitement. The sous vide chicken was tender, but again the rest of the dish was totally boring .

This time, we were glad to discover that the quality of food is exquisite as a year ago. They're definitely worthy of the michelin star, even in the hands of the new chef Akshay Bhardwaj!! They faithfully replicate the flavor profiles from India, don't skimp out on chillies where needed, and give enough twists to the dishes to keep things interesting. If you call yourself a foodie and are around NYC, you should come here, period.We got the three course menu. Here are the highlights.Appetizers---Five pepper scallop- buttery scallop, fresh spicy coulis, sweet and sour marmalade. Perfect combination and layering of flavors. However, they give only one scallop :-/Deep-fried octopus- fried in rice flour, doused in black salt. So crunchy! Octopus cooked perfectly.Mains and sides---Pork mundu chili- perfect, perfect, perfect! Fatty pieces of pork belly, cooked tender in a familiar red meat curry gravy that's so balanced, and the baby turnips on top add a fresh zing. Such a harmonious dish.Zatar and gruyere naan- Innovation done right. The variety of flavors worked great inside the naan.Desserts---Drunken shahi tukda- yum!!!! Again a very harmonious dish. The soft fried bread, the not too sweet saffron rabdi with a hint of alcohol, dry fruits and rose petals.. a dessert fit for a (food) royal!Cardamom chocolate cake- They brought it out because of our occasion! The flavor combo worked out great.Overall, Junoon is still the place Indian restaurants look up to in NYC. I'd like to mention that the service can be a lot better: the wait time between our dishes were pretty long, and the waiters are a bit cold considering the fine dining setting. However, they deliver purely in terms of flavor. Good food makes you happy, and Junoon managed to make us very happy and content.

Luckily, we were able to get a reservation for four just a couple of hours before. We arrived at 7 PM and were promptly seated. As soon as we sat down we began to peruse their very impressive cocktail list. I ordered the adraki punch which was delicious, and my friends ordered a variety of different cocktails which I don't remember the names of but they were all excellent. When it came time to eating dinner we ordered a bottle of wine which they didn't have in stock, but our server brought over the sommelier who was able to get us a similar bottle at a similar price point which everyone loved. Our very attractive server then explained the menu to us. We were given the option of an 8 course tasting menu for about $135, but opted for the more reasonable 3 course menu for $75 per person which included daal, rice, bread and raita. For our appetizers, we tried the tandoori octopus, the lal mirch ka paneer, and a shrimp dish I couldn't try because of my allergies. For our entrees we ordered the lal mas, the lamb chops and two other dishes I can't remember the names of. We also tried the garlic naan and the junoon spice naan with gruyere cheese (which was PHENOMENAL). We couldn't believe the amount of food we were served and it seemed like the dishes kept coming. The presentation and flavor of each dish was spectacular. We were truly impressed.I have a major sweet tooth and was really excited about the array of desserts. We ordered the falooda, the drunken shahi tukra, ma's rice pudding and the kulfi pops. Unfortunately for me, the dessert was the only disappointing part of the experience as we tried all four and didn't like any. It's really difficult for me to not like dessert, so i'm not sure if maybe the flavors were all acquired tastes or what, but either i'd eaten so much at that point that I didn't need the extra calories (nor did I have space in my stomach for anything else).

4.0,10/24/2018,"Junoon's innovative Indian menu earned it a Michelin star for several years. I've tried a few of these creative dishes, and some work better than others. The saffron cardamom foie gras appetizer consists of foie gras mousse on mini lacha parathas, sprinkled with foie gras ash. This is one of the dishes that look very interesting on paper, but the execution really didn't do anything for me, which was a shame because I was so excited about it based on the description on the menu. The tellicherry duck is a star dish. The black peppercorn sauce packs just the perfect amount of heat to make beads of sweat appear on my brow, and make my tastebuds dance with joy. It pairs great with lacha paratha and with basmati rice. The rice pudding is some of the best I've had in a while. The word on the street is that the owner's mother makes it herself on a regular basis. Hence the name Ma's rice pudding. The superior service that everybody seems to rave about is exactly what I have not experienced at Junoon. Apparently, the staff at Junoon thinks it's OK for a customer to reserve a table and still be seated at the bar. After having made my reservation more than two weeks in advance, when I showed up at the restaurant, I was told that my reservation had been moved to the bar (which is usually for people who don't have reservations), but that I should be OK with that because the full dinner menu was offered at the bar. The attentiveness that other reviews talk about was entirely missing from my experience (my drink order and side were both forgotten initially, but I ultimately got both). While I do enjoy Junoon, it is no Tamarind or Indian Accent in terms of taste or service.",10,4,8,Kashif K.,"Manhattan, NY",1485,381,8670

We were there for lunch and service for just about okay, not polished enough but available. Now let's come to food, we had looked at the online menus and knew what we wanted but our selections didn't feature on the lunch menu. We had called in earlier to make sure a la carte was an option for lunch and were told we were, now you know why we were disappointed as the lunch menu was limited. On special request they made us palak koftas and the dish was super fresh and wonderful. As for breads Junoon cheese Naan was good but the laccha paratha and onion kulcha were a disappointment.

They were both excellent. The eggplant was very crispy and the chicken had a great sear that paired really well with the sauce.Entrees: We ordered paneer and artichoke mattar. The naan was amazingly soft and paired perfectly with the delicious, buttery paneer. In comparison, the artichoke mattar was almost disappointing (though still good).Dessert/Drinks: The kulfi was good. The drinks we had were excellent. I had a 27 West, which I really enjoyed.

5.0,10/5/2018,"Probably the best Indian food we have ever had. From the drinks to the dessert, it was just pure gold. We dined in the Main dining room and did the 3 course meal. Appetizers: We got the Ghost Chili Murgh Tikka and the Smoked masala ribs- both were heavenly. Generally, I feel like Tikka can be dry, but this was not the case at all. There was just so much flavor involved, and it was incredible. Entree: I had the Lobster Moilee and my partner got the Telicherry Duck and all I can say is.. what?!! How in the world can you get so much flavor into this? Let me tell you, I am actually South Indian and Moilee is actually something made in South India often. It is actually a difficult dish.. and on top of that, it was made with lobster!! Fantastic job with these dishes. Dessert: We got the drunken shahi Turka and the kulfi pops. The cake was a saffron cane drenched with delicious rum and a crunchy surprise of mini popcorn on top! I swear, all of my taste buds were tingling. The kulfi pops took me back to India - I mean, how do you get the paan leaf flavor like that?! So awesome!! Drinks: Mumbai margarita - mango margaritas with the right amount of spice.

1.0,9/29/2018,"Oh boy, where to start... I love Indian food, probably my favorite cuisine. Living in Singapore has spoiled me for amazing Indian food, from diviest-dives to upscale, and luckily New York also has some really great options for Indian. Junoon is not one of those options, not even close. I hate to give any establishment 1 star, but there were so many problems that I am shocked that this holds anywhere NEAR 1 Michelin star; the Michelin guide loses all credibility in my eyes by giving Junoon 1 star and not its (far) superior competitors Tamarind and Indian Accent. The Good: - Honestly, there was not one good point of this meal. I can't believe I am saying this, but it is true. The Not So Good: - The food was some of the worst Indian food I've ever tasted, and probably the worst meal I've had in New York City, ever. First of all, everything was horribly lukewarm, verging on cold. Sent back, and received in the same condition... The ""curry"" tasted of cheap, canned tomato, akin to ketchup of all things. No one at my 4-person table finished anything we were served. Lazily executed and a poor excuse for upscale Indian food. - The service was terrible. We waited in the entrance seating area for about 20 minutes after being told to wait for our table by the hostess. Finally, we asked if our table was ready since it was 20 minutes past our reservation time, and she said ""oh, yeah"" like she had forgotten about us (the only people in the waiting area...) and brought us to our table. The waiter was curt, unhelpful and made 0 conversation with us. My table all laughed at the fact that when water was poured it was splashed dramatically all over the place without apology/acknowledgement from the waiter. Just not good all around.- Cheap, tacky decor should have been the first sign for me to run away. Phew, rant over. I am astonished at the quality of this restaurant, especially with its Michelin star certification.

5.0,9/10/2018,"This was without a doubt one of the best meals of my adult life. I did a three course menu for $75 on a Saturday night, which was definitely reasonable considering the reputation and location. Our server Daniel was excellent. He paced everything perfectly and read the table extremely well; kudos to you, Daniel! (He even spoke French to us-- which was charming, I thought, even if Hindi might've been more apropos since we were in an Indian restaurant.) He clearly knew his stuff and my friend and I both felt like we were in good hands with him.Drinks to start off with were terrific. I had a raspberry basil soda mocktail. Sweet without being overpowering, the basil was an excellent touch that added notes of green and complexity to what could have been a cloying afterthought of an offering. As someone who doesn't drink alcohol, I am always on the hunt for a place that devotes time and attention to a good mocktail-- Junoon, you got me verklempt. I loved it. Can't comment on the cocktails, but my friend certainly enjoyed his 27 west, which is Junoon's take on a manhattan.  Food-wise, we started with the lahsooni gobi and lal mirch pa kaneer. The lal mirch pa kaneer was marvelous; the cheese was mild, firm, and subtle. It paired so beautifully with the peach and fig, and the confit pepper offered a contrast in texture to balance the richness of the cheese. Absolutely loved this dish. My friend's lahsooni gobi was worth fighting over as well, great texture to the cauliflower and wonderful, warm flavor to it-- slightly piquant but not overwhelming. The plates were cleared and reset with plenty of time to spare between courses, and no one rushed us or hurried us along, which is always great because timing courses out can be tricky when you talk as much as I do. Our mains were the nizami paneer and the murgh lababdar. We ordered the saffron rice to accompany those, and garlic naan as well. The lababdar was exquisite. The chicken was so tender and paired so well with the saffron rice. My friend's nizami paneer was gorgeous. The sauces for both of these dishes were so vivid and flavorful and well-balanced. Not one discordant note in the whole production.Dessert was the rice pudding and falooda with dark chocolate that you cracked open, releasing a sauce inside over the main portion of the dessert. I wasn't actually sure what it was, now that I think about it, and this was the only thing the whole night that wasn't excellent. Aside from the chocolate it just didn't really taste like anything; it just had no flavor. Puzzling. The rice pudding more than made up for it, though. Thick and creamy and not too sweet (it cleverly derives most of its sweetness from the candied almonds and caramelized banana) I was very sad when it was gone. Which is how I felt about everything else, except for the falooda.Another thing-- I had been working all day and hadn't thought to look up Junoon when it was suggested, so I went in blind-- and I found myself hideously embarrassed to be wearing only a T-shirt and jeans to this gorgeous restaurant. This could have been really unpleasant-- I don't know if I necessarily would have let me into my own fancy restaurant wearing just a t shirt and jeans, but the staff didn't seem to look twice. (But seriously, dress up here. You'll feel like an a-hole if you don't.) If anyone was rolling their eyes, they were kind enough not to do it out in the open, so kudos to the staff also for their discretion. Thank you, Junoon, for the delicious meal, for the terrific service, and for pretending like I'm a fully functional adult who can dress himself properly. I am, I promise-- and when I come back, I'll be in a button-up shirt and real people clothes. Promise!",1,1,0,E L.,"Washington, DC",1,12,2

For the others:- Grilled Octopus was excellently cooked without being rubbery- Smoked ribs came in a huge portion, too many almost and this was my least favorite dish, it was just too much of a good thing maybe, and a bit too salty- Tellicherry peppercorn duck, hands down the best dish of the night, so good. I loved it enough to look up the recipe- Eggplant with shishito pepper, it was also very solid, never had really tasted that kind of pepper fully cooked in a sauce before- All the rice, naan, lentil and raita were excellent. Also loved the pickled onion and pepper on the side- For dessert, the kulfi pops were great as well as the rice pudding!They don't skimp on portions, we had to take some of the rice pudding to go.  For two it was about $200 tax and tip, without alcohol, but we did have two pots of tea.Great food and we will be back!",1,0,0,Wei Z.,"San Francisco, CA",47,61,34

The jaljeera shots were an amazing start followed by the lasooni Gobi and Mirchi pakora. We had the luck of receiving a complimentary eggplant Chaat that was surprisingly super tasty. The main entrees were no less in taste, texture and appearance of the dishes. Even the rice was well flavored albeit mild. Finally, the desserts need special mention. Their presentation and taste were nothing like I have ever had so far. The falooda was presented with most of it components on the base with a cute little chocolate pot holding the rose rabri. The kulfi pops..OMG! Each was a heavenly flavor and the sweetness is perfect that it gives you no guilt in having all the 4 in a go.My partner while picking out our choices from the menu said "" you can't go wrong with this place"" and I was a bit skeptical.

1.0,8/12/2018,"We had dinner reservation on Aug 12th, 2018 for celebration. We had a disappointing experience that now we have concluded we will never be returning back to Junoon.We had visited this resturant back in 2014 when Vikas Khanna's menu was served (the cauliflower tree) and we had great experience. Given it is Michelin star resturant following are the list of disappointments:- Last time in 2014 they called to confirm reservation and gave some pointers before the day of dinner. In 2018, I made online reservation where I mentioned the details of the event with personalized message note. I didn't get any call and on top of that got multiple messages on email and text to confirm the dinner even though it was me who got the online reservation at the first place.- When we reached at the resturant they had no clue of the reason of celebration, so any details I filled online was just waste of time. When we reached at resturant, I mentioned them about the celebration reason then also they were all over the place and mismanaged.- We had backpack with us. In 2014, there were people to take away bags or coats at the entrace so that we had stress free experince but in 2018 not just front area was not cleaned but now you have to carry bag with you inside resturant and keep it under the table. Small change but made huge difference in experience.- In 2014, we had ala carte but now in 2018 they have fixed menu where you like the options or not you are stuck with options. You pay $115, $75 or $42. For vegeterians $42 menu is super limited in choice and you are almost pushed to select $75 menu.- The guy who came for order helped us in terms of sorting out the understanding of the arrangement. [Positive]- Dal makhni was super cremy and heavy. In 2014, any food we had we never felt bloated. In 2018, Nizam paneer, Dal makhni was super cremy. - We had eggplant pakora which was good and different but not unique. Eggplant salan was good.- We needed extra bread which was $13 but server told us it will be charged extra. In a Michelin star resturant when server tells you $13 for extra naan bread it leaves bad taste in the mouth. Anyone who is going to visit Michelin resturant is aware and capable of paying $13.- Dessert menu lacks originality. Desserts were good but nothing extraordinary or unique. In 2014, we had green chilli ice cream and we were blown away by the taste and experience.- The server was pushy to get another bottle of wine.- We got check in the end which had feedback form but no pen was provided with the check. If resturant is serious about feedback then either they should provide pen or not provide the feedback form.- In the end, we had lot of left over food which we requested to box for take away. They gave us ticket for food to be collected later.- In the end we provided our ticket but found they gave our left over packed food to someone else.-  We did pay for that food and They did not apologized for the messup. It was such a bad experience that they offered was someone else food in exchange.- The whole experince was just not even worth regular resturant quality but we end up paying $450  for 5 people.- From 2014 to 2018 it is such a steep decline in quality of resturant in food, service and hospitality that made me realize how on sunday night resturant was only half booked as compared to 2014 when to get reservation I had to call a month in advance.- This was the last time I visited Junoon and it is sad to see legacy of Vikas Khanna getting wasted.",3,3,1,Vaibhav G.,"San Jose, CA",4,6,3

This place earned a Michelin star this year and their service from beginning to end really embodied that.For the meal, we decided to split all of our dishes:Eggplant chaat (4 stars): This was a simple, yet refined dish and had a great flavor and bite to it.Ghost chili murgh tikka (4.5 stars): This might have been my favorite dish of the night as the chicken was cooked perfectly and the sauce packed a nice punch.Methi Aloo Palak (4 stars): We both really enjoyed this dish and it was a good size as well.Malabari shrimp (4 stars): The real star of this dish was the curry as it was super flavorful and had just the right amount of spice.The desserts were some of the best parts of the meal as well as they incorporated several unique flavors--the most memorable was a mint-flavored sorbet that was delicious.Overall, this place served up some great food and even better service. They definitely don't have any weak dishes and it was one of the better experiences I've had in an Indian restaurant in the city. Does it warrant a visit to check out a Michelin-star rated place?

4.0,8/4/2018,"Came back from India and really wanted to have Indian food. Since Junoon was doing restaurant week and has 1 Michelin Star then leggoWent on a Thursday evening. It was all filled up probably because of restaurant week. It makes sense because regularly it's (kinda) min $75 per person cuz you must order from $75/3 courses or $115/6 courses. The choices on the restaurant week menu were all available in the regular 3 course menu (pretty extensive) so I wasn't worried about quality. My family just went with restaurant week menu because there were less choices so it was easier to choose. Between the four of us we got (sorry forgot exact names and the online menu isn't the actual one)Appetizer: Eggplant - fried/baked but I really like the crunchy yet soft inside texture, Indians make good veg  Salmon - presentation of this plate was the best, came with three chunks of salmon which would've totally passed as a main course, salmon was tender and the I like the sauce (reminds me of biryani) and how it came with three types of beets (so cool!!)Chicken - had ghost chili, was spicy but nothing unbearable, chicken super tender and juicy Watermelon - hahaha was refreshing but looked kinda sad considering how small it was compare to the others Main course: Paneer - this was my dish and there was something stuffed in the paneer, interesting. Really like the tomato sauce, very sweet and appetizing Pork belly - was grilled or something so no curry Shrimp - nice big size Chicken - not memorable Overall the curries for the main course was nice and smooth and had all the right flavors. It's probably americanized but it's too mild in spices and spiciness compared to India!!! The appetizers were exciting so main course seemed underwhelming. It came with roti or naan. Omg that feeling of eating with my hands again. They definitely didn't come with enough bread!!!! Boohoo I miss having unlimited naan in India.

5.0,8/3/2018,"Junoon is one of the best Indian Restaurant I have been in newyork. It is a upscale Michelin Star restaurant with not so spicy or tadakta badhakta Indian taste but it is suttle and classy and that is exactly what you pay for. The suttle ness in the taste has blown me away and It still gives my taste buds a reminder of experience. Anyway, apart from this too the the restaurant is amazing. The decor, the ambience all things together actually brings together bring the atmosphere to romantic setting. Want to go on a date?  This place is perfect. The servers at this restaurant are amazing and well trained . They don't keep bothering you and niether do they ignore you. They exactly know when to ask their customer for what. I had one the finest shahi tukra ever in Junoon. The place is big and neat and clean and smells great. It is open until 12:00am in the heart of newyork city. You can take either three course meals or alacarte whatever you prefer. The parking can be a little far away And the walk is all worth the food. It is nice , upscale restaurant and it would be not so realistic to compare it with other restaurants in the area. It has its own place and unique taste and definitely stands out.

I was hesitating between a 4 and a 5, I think Junoon gets 5 because of the evident hard work that was put into making our meal. My S.O and I tried the tasting menu, and everything was impeccable.

What I don't understand is the service.The prices here create an expectation of excellent, fine dining service. Instead, our server was confused, didn't know the menu well, and (less of an issue) was totally awkward at our table. You could chalk this all up to me being a hyper-critical customer, but I think the wine service does a lot to prove my point: We ordered a bottle of wine and it didn't come until after our first course. There is a SOMMELIER, so it's not like our server was busy and couldn't make it to us. We sat there without any drinks for a good 20 minutes, as we watched the sommelier hang out around the restaurant not busy at all. (I'm not clear if he'd even been told about our order yet or not.)

3.0,7/22/2018,"I just left this overhyped restaurant, and I'm.. underwhelmed. My bf and I went here for our 2 year anniversary dinner. We each got an appetizer, an entree, and a drink. We also got an (unnecessary) bottle of pinot gris. TL;DR - come here for appetizers and drinks, but go somewhere else for your entree Drinks - we got the margarita and the gin/tonic. Both were amazing. Highly recommend. Appetizers - we got the paneer and the scallop. Both were delicious! I did wonder how they got away with charging so much for one single scallop though, good lord. Also, portion sizes are vastly different - paneer came with 3 pieces. Entrees - this is where it started to go downhill for me. I wanted the dal makhani, but the waiter insisted I get the lotus root dish, and I obliged. What appeared in front of me was a flavorful tomato sauce with chunks of something that tasted and felt like celery - gross. I flagged down the waiter and ordered the dal makhani, which he brought me after yelling across the restaurant to another waiter ""she doesn't like the food! She wants dal makhani!"" Oh gosh :( Btw, the bf got the goat, and he said it was incredibly spicy, but he loved it. None of the desserts caught our eye, so we just left after those two courses. I was annoyed that the waiter didn't take the lotus root dish off our bill. Also, service here is suuuuper slow. We didn't see our waiter for 20 mins at a time.

The ghost chicken appetizer (which was actually pretty spicy) and panner entree were my personal favorite. We also got lamb biriyani since that is my mom's famous dish and we wanted to compare, and Junoon executed the dish perfectly. It had the aroma of saffron, and tasted amazing. It was better than my mom's, but I didn't tell her that. Great food for vegetarians and meat eaters alike. We also at the end decided to get one desert for us, and we ordered an amazing assortment of three luxurious flavors of kulfi.

4.0,7/16/2018,"Junoon is definitely a fine-dining restaurant rated with a Michelin star. We chose to experience the 3 course meal at $75/person which included our choices of an appetizer, entree, and dessert. It was clear that our server was highly experienced and well-versed in the menu but I got the feeling that he was less accommodating to us because we were two younger women. He was also not as knowledgeable about the extensive wine selection as I asked for a sweet, white wine and he went off to ask others for suggestions but in the end, I ended up with a glass of a sweet but more dry wine.... We had the Tandoori Octupus and Ghost Chili Murgh Tikka (Ghost Chili Chicken) for appetizers - the octopus was my absolute favorite selection of our entire meal & I would order it again in a heartbeat. It was chewy and tasty. The ghost chili chicken came in a very generous portion and was definitely spicy but oddly satisfying. Be careful not to eat too much during the appetizer course - this is where we went wrong and we couldn't even finish half of our main entree! Tragic.For our main course, we ordered the lamb chops and Malabari Shrimp. The shrimp only had about 4-5 pieces but they were very large pieces. I loved the curry that came with the shrimp and there were definitely enough sides to try it with (different flavors of naan, rice, bread, etc.) The garlic naan was my personal favorite! The lamb chops were a bit hard to navigate as cutting the meat off lamb chops is always an awkward experience but they were tender and amazing. For dessert, we ordered the Kulfi pops and the Falooda. I only liked the mango Kulfi pop as I thought the other flavors were too exotic for my liking but my friend liked all of them but the mango! I also loved the rich, dark chocolate in the Falooda! On a side note, the bathroom could definitely use some regular maintenance.... it was a rough experience.",1,3,2,Kyu S.,"New York, NY",388,88,76

The service was mostly good, although some of the waiters were a bit abrasive and hard to understand when they explained what I was eating. I tried both the vegetarian and non vegetarian tasting menus. Some of the memorable bits was their bird (can't remember which type). It was cooked perfectly well, crisp, and still moist. The scallop was also good, but not mind blowing. Overall it was a delicious meal with a strong preference for the non vegetarian tasting.

4.0,7/6/2018,"Came here for a birthday dinner and did the 3 course menu. The menu is nice, they have plenty of options for you to pick from for all 3 courses and it is not too similar to normal north Indian menus. I started with the paneer with fig chutney which was delicious and my favorite dish of the night. Others got the fried peppers and ghost chili chicken. Both were good, but the chicken was wonderfully tender and not too spicy. For entrees, we got the lamb shank, spicy goat, mushrooms and stuffed paneer. The paneer was the best of the entrees, really nicely seasoned and in a divine sauce. The lamb was good, cooked perfectly, but lacked spice, the sauce provided the only flavor which the lamb barely soaked up. Overall a good dish, but not great (and it should be since they are michelin starred). The goat was my least favorite, while it was nice and spicy (be warned it is really spicy) it didn't have any other flavor than heat. The mushrooms were quite good as was the daal makhani (black lentils) that came with the entrees. The entrees also came with yellow lentils which were tasty but a little runny, two types of rice and four types of bread. We got three types of naan (the one stuffed with cheese was the best, be sure to order it) and laccha paratha. It is alot of food. I like to eat, I have been known to eat 2lb steaks, trust me, this is PLENTY of food. By the time dessert came around we were hoping they'd forget to take our order. Speaking of, the desserts were good, the ice cream was alright (mango, paan leaf, saffron and coriander (best one) and rose) but the presentation was beautiful. The rice pudding was good, but nothing special, the falooda was very good and the saffron cake was the clear favorite.The service was excellent, very professional placing your dishes on the table at the same time etc and the ambiance is gorgeous. For $75 per person it is not cheap, but you get alot of food and it is a nice experience.

He suggested eggplant chat and lal mirch ka paneer. Same for main course 2 suggestions outright and without knowing what we wanna eat. Things went bad when I found hair in my eggplant chat. Disgusting! I told this to the server and he defended it by saying everyone in wearing caps. It happens sometimes by mistake. Great response by a staff of a Michelin star restaurant. I right away asked to cancel my plate. Another person in our party also felt disgusting and asked to cancel his plate. The server is now asking for clarification why you are cancelling the plate ? What do you mean? Your food quality is bad with hairs flying around in the food that's why he is cancelling. With this rude response everyone cancelled their plate before the main course.No manager came to our table to at least apologise or make up with their mistake.

1.0,6/27/2018,"Given the Michelin star status, I am appalled by the service and the lack of variety in the menu, especially for persons with dietary restrictions. First, most, if not all indian places are more than accommodating for Jains, and I am confused as to why this quality of service was not reflected at Junoon. Like, if its an Indian restaurant, it is completely reasonable to assume they will have more than one entree that can be prepared without using onions (and without making a fuss). If this is something your restaurant cannot provide, it should be explicitly stated on the website. Second, given the obvious limitations of your menu, it is also wise to not meet customer requests with condescension or charge them a whopping $23 for something that is far simpler than an entree on the menu. I too work in the customer service industry, and last I checked, the rule of thumb is that the customer is always right. Third, why ask guests to check food sensitivities when making a reservation if you're not going to be able to do anything about them? seems a bit redundant to me. In addition, the food is just not that great. I got an eggplant chaat, quinoa chaat, and a couple of entrees and they were very meh. I wouldn't recommend it.",1,0,1,Eashaa P.,"New York, NY",307,3,0

We had an order of dahl, and when we asked for some small bowls the server said there would be a surcharge because he had to go back in the kitchen and get them.

I made a reservation on the phone to make sure a spot be available when we reach there after a long day of touristy activities. We were asked to wait for our table to be prepared. Don't know how that takes 40 minutes and me having to go ask twice about the status. We get seated on a table and the server brings us a drinks/wine menu. I asked if we could be seated on the other side with the open kitchen view - named the Patiala house? He asks me to go out make the inquiry myself. Kind of uncomfortable at his gesture, I still make my way out and inquire to be told ""let me check"" and after 5 minutes be told ""sorry sir, we have a dress code"" Thanks for putting it on one website-open table but it wasn't really obvious. Maybe I should have known better that tourists aren't welcome on the other side. Alright, made my way back to my table not very happy with the idea to sit where I didn't want to be seated....the experience already partially ruined. I ask the server to bring me a menu, it is 50 minutes past our reservation now. The server says "" which menu_ long pause_ food or drink?""

3.0,5/22/2018,"This was my first visit to Junoon. I was there to celebrate my daughter's birthday, so my expectations were high for this Michelin starred restaurant. Upon our arrival, we were nicely greeted by a gentleman who acknowledged my daughter's birthday. We ordered from the prix-fix lunch menu. The scallop appetizer and lobster entree were absolutely delicious. I wasn't a total fan of the almond cake dessert. Aside from having a great meal, I thought the service was lacking for a Michelin starred restaurant. The waitress asked did we need an additional bowl of rice, and we replied yes. She did not bring back the rice until 20 minutes later, and that was only after prompting from us. By then, the remaining portion of our lobster entrees had gotten cold. She did not return to our table on a regular basis to see how we were enjoying our meal. I consider the total package of food and service in my dining experience, and I have to give Junoon three stars because of the wait staff. I have dined at many other Michelin starred restaurant, and I have to say, that Junoon has the worse wait staff which is unfortunate since the food is so good. To top things off, the waitress brought our bill to the table prior to us even finishing our meal. I think for a truly fine dining experience, a diner should NOT be given a bill during the meal.

5.0,5/13/2018,"Started off dinner by sharing the Shrimp Butter Pepper Garlic, Naan, and Garlic Naan. The shrimp were big and had so much meat on them. The sauce that was served on top of them was really good too! Both Naans were good, but if I had to choose between the two; Garlic Naan reigns supreme. There's just so much more taste to it and also very cheesy too!My main course was the Shahi Lamb Shank. The meat was cooked so perfectly that it didn't take much effort to cut it from the bone. This dish goes so well with the side of Naan due to the amount of curry served with the shank. Depending on how high your spice in-take is, the Naan becomes a nice savior when you need a quick break from the shank that's covered with curry. If you are a Game of Thrones fan, you are in luck because Junoon has a list of GoT themed cocktails! My friend had a glass of John Snow (Hennessy VS, Ardbeg 10-yr Scotch, Carpano Antica, Crème de cacao a la vanilla, Angoustra Bitters, spice smoke), while I enjoyed a glass of Lannister (Hennessy VS, Ardbeg 10-yr Scotch, Carpano Antica, Crème de cacao a la vanilla, Angoustra Bitters, spice smoke). Needless to say, due to the Hennessy in John Snow, that drink was super strong! Definitely a sip-worthy kind of drink. Meanwhile, the Lannister was pretty sweet and served with a small peice of an orange peel. The service was on-point! I was probably 15 minutes earlier than the time I reserved, and they were able to accommodate very seamlessly. The waiting staff were polite and did a great job explaining any questions about the menu selections. Overall, I highly recommend this place, especially for a date night!",1,0,0,Philip M.,"Little Falls, NJ",2,2,2

3.0,5/13/2018,"We visited Junoon with really high expectations because it is a Michelin Star restaurant. We were expecting to be blown away with excellent service, food and ambience. The service fell flat right from the start, right from the person who seated us to the server. There was a raucous group that was creating quite a scene - enough to spoil our evening. At one point I think someone from that group even hooted and whistled loud enough to go around the room. At some point the restaurant needs to request them to quieten down, especially if you claim to be a classy upscale place. The food however lived up to its hype. We had the paneer, ghost chili tikka and lobster moilee and it was on point! I'm not sure it made up for the rest of the negatives though.",0,0,0,Roshani T.,"Los Angeles, CA",8,134,29

It's high end Indian cuisine and the food is plated beautifully and incredibly clean. The restaurant itself looks into their open kitchen and their bar area has a trendy feel and is pretty sizable for the city so we never had trouble finding a seat.

For a place that is Michelin rated and a place that I have experienced multiple times the service was a let down . It was more hiccupy depending on the sever you dealt with. Some were so good that they made an attempt to make it a great experience and some were so much in a hurry to just serve you the food and move on that you felt insignificant.

It smells great in here, and I hear the bartenders make some great cocktails (I don't drink so I can't comment personally). I ordered 2 items. The paneer and the portobello.I should note it took an incredibly long amount of time for my first course to come out. And there was also a wait between courses. Paneer - was spicy, but great flavors. The grilled accompaniments underneath added a nice flavor.Portobello main- the stuffed mushroom was great and flavorful. The potatoes it came with also tasted good on their own. I have a hard time with these two items together though. I also added a side of rice. $6 for a side of rice seems  a bit excessive.

5.0,4/13/2018,"Yet another wonderful dinner at this flatiron Michelin star modern Indian restaurant after a worthwhile wait. Me and my group of four ordered three course meal $75 each as per our server recommendation. Eggplant chat, garlic butter pepper shrimp, five pepper scallop and masala ribs and daily trio of chutney tasting as appetizer were amazing.As entree, lobster moiley, ( coconut milk based South Indian lobster curry ) lamb chop, baigan mirchi Ka Salan ( subtle sweet and spicy eggplant and shishito pepper in peanut, sesame seeds  and coconut purée flavored with South Indian style curry) and duck tellicherry ( aged duck breast seared to the temperature, served over tellicherry pepper sauce) all were Junoon chefs speciality that I have never seen in any other Indian restaurant were an eye opener to the Indian cuisine that I never came across to it. Our 3 course pre fix entree were served with choice of rice, basket of our choice of bread, Raita, choice of daal ( which were included in the pre fix meal) Each dish were delicately spiced, while enjoying the meal, I could think of the process and details they have gone through was clearly visible. It was a journey to India which I would love to visit one day.Then comes the dessert. We left it to our server and his assistant to choose it. It was Ma's rice pudding,( yummy) four different flavor of kulfi ( cardamom and rose were amazing, but one of my Indian freind favorite was paan kulfi) were nice popsicle of it. Indian style of bread pudding flavored with Paul John whiskey ( Sahi Tukra) and House made three flavored sorbet were icing in the cake. Junoon cocktail list is very thoughtful and interesting. My 27 West (a take on classic old fashion) was matching my sahi tukra, flavored with Paul John whiskey was excellent. My server team, Arturo, Maria and Nicholas and bartender Christian were very helpful to choose our dinner. Our entree took about 15 minuted to be served but they were busy at the time and we could see the kitchen were on full swing and it worth a wait.It was a lovely experience in gastronomic journey of India.

1.0,4/13/2018,"Went here for a team dinner and was disappointed to say the least when expecting a one-start Michelin experience. The octopus appetizer was a piece of rubber, the shrimp was overcooked, and the quinoa chaat was extremely salty. For the mains, we ordered tandoori chicken, lamb shank, black bass, and a few vegetarian options. The chicken was okay but I've had just as good if not better at a take-out spot. The bass was way over cooked and I had to scrape out the white meat from the inside. The artichoke that came with bass was pretty much still raw, although on the menu it's claimed as poached.

1.0,4/12/2018,We had a horrendous experience at Junoon last night. There were three of us in my party. We ordered a beer and two Tito's then sat with our water glasses for twenty minutes after which we asked where our drinks were. A full ten minutes elapsed before the waiter finally brought them. We had ordered several appetizers along with the drinks. They were served ice cold. We asked if they were meant to be cold--since one was fried and the other grilled. We were told they were to be room temperature. When we repeated they were ice cold the waiter said he was sorry but did nothing. Our entrees were all poorly cooked. The lamb shank was like mush. The fried vegetarian was cold and the fish over cooked and tasteless. We did not stay for dessert. Truly disappointing as I was with family members I don't often get to dine with.

2.0,4/8/2018,"This is an update to my previous review.  There were 4 of us dining at Junoon the other night and the waiter suggested that we purchase the $75 price fixed option - which we did.  The total cost with 3 drinks, tax, and tip was just under $500 ($125 per person).  When the shrimp appetizer came there were only 3 shrimp for 4 people.  I mentioned to one of the serving team that it's very difficult to split 3 shrimp between 4 people and we'd appreciate a 4th shrimp.  He nodded his head in agreement but never bothered to bring us a 4th shrimp.  So for a $500 meal, my wife and I shared a shrimp (not easy to divide by two because of how a shrimp is thicker at one end than the other).Note, you can see from my other reviews, that I'm not one of those people who complain regularly on Yelp... this shrimp incident really ticked me off given that the dinner was $500.  How silly and shortsighted of Junoon!  They would have had a happy customer by giving one more shrimp, but now I will take my future Indian cuisine dining dollars to one of the many other great Indian restaurants in New York City.",0,0,0,Mark O.,"Montvale, NJ",1,19,1

The kofta was so soft yet crispy on the bed of yummy mustard greens.

Octopus was literally the softest I have ever had. Sauce complimented it well, also had some potatoes mixed in, and everything was interesting and unique with an Indian flavor (first time trying octopus this way).For entrees Ralph got Tawa Black Bass (chayote coconut puree, naan upma) and I got the Murgh Lababdar (Tandoor grilled chicken, tomato sauce, fenugreek). Funny sounding name, but dish was delicious! Very very well made and you can taste the quality in every bite. Portions weren't huge which was too bad but still felt very full by the time I finished.

That said a $220 dinner for 1 app, 2 entrees, one order of naan and yogurt (no rice) is EXCESSIVE. Quite frankly there's other Indian restaurants in city doing food just as good for fraction of the price. I was surprised food all came out quickly. Our server was proper but snotty with no personality. I wont go back. Lamb shank extremely overpriced its mind boggling, bit dry but in a thick sauce.Duck breast was servers suggestion but maybe only bc of the $39 cost. This consisted of duck breast thin slices over a lackluster sauce. For that price there was literally nothing else at all on the plate.... rice isn't even included. Neither sauce was complex or had any depth.

2.0,3/25/2018,"I came to Junoon after being told dinner was fully booked at Cote. We wanted to go somewhere nearby and this happened to be a few minutes away. I didn't look too closely into the reviews or pictures so I was surprised when it turned out to be a pretty upscale restaurant. It has a spacious waiting room with a separate front desk for coat checks and take-out. The dining room has a huge bar and the servers are all dressed in suits. It definitely had a more formal vibe and I wouldn't come here for everyday dining.We ordered 4 dishes off of the server's recommendation: eggplant chaat, garlic naan, malabar shrimp curry and murgh lababdar. The eggplant chaat was good, but honestly nothing special. It's essentially tempura, but a lot thinner. The eggplant is so thin you can barely taste it. The shrimp curry was alright. It has a coconut milk base so it's a lot tangier than the other curry dish we ordered. The shrimp was big and very good, but we didn't think the dish was worth the whopping $36 price tag. My favorite of the three was the murgh lababdar. It has a tomato based sauce and comes with tandoor grilled chicken. It has a little heat to it, but nothing overwhelming. We absolutely loved this dish, but wish it came with more chicken as it came with exactly FIVE pieces...and for $31, we expected more.Based off of the food alone, I would give the restaurant 4 stars, but everything was seriously so overpriced. They charge $6 for rice. How are you supposed to eat curry without rice?! The bill came out to more than $110 for the two of us for ordering 2 curry dishes, 1 appetizer and 1 naan.

Everything was exquisitely presented but none of the them really stood out in terms of flavor profile expect for the paneer. We tried the kulfi and shahi tukda for desert.

While making the reservation ahead of time on the phone I was asked whether want to be seated in casual or formal area. The formal area has a predefined menu. We chose the casual area as we wanted to order a la carte items. They suggested a $75.00 per person option which included an appetizer, a main dish and dessert option plus daal, raita and unlimited naan and rice for the table which we ended up trying. Tried their saloni fish, paneer tikka and Malabar shrimp for appetizer. The paneer tikka was hot but we had been warned before. Along with this they gave us multiple chutneys with various spice levels to try. For main course we had tandoori chicken, paneer green kofta and lamb chops. Presentation of each of the dishes was lovely and were tasting great. We liked most of them except their green paneer cutlets. They also brought out their yellow and black dal - both of them for us to try. We had their pulao rice. Their junoon naan was stuffed with panner and cheese and was very soft and delicious. The whole dining experience starting from seating to food and service was nothing short of excellent. In desserts we had their shahi kheer, 4 flavors of kulfi and their shahi tukda (bread) on recommendation of our server and just loved them.

3.0,3/1/2018,"It absolutely kills me to give Junoon a 3 star rating, especially given all of the hype. To begin, we had a reservation and showed up 10 minutes beforehand. They let us know that our table wasn't ready and they'd seat us shortly. We must have waited 25 minutes before they finally sat us. When they finally did, no waiter had given us the time of day - no menu, no water, no greeting. After 15 minutes, we had to specifically go up to the waiter to ask for service. Same story for when we got the menu and drinks - they had to take another 10 minutes to finally take down our orders. To top it all off, after 25 more minutes, nothing besides our drinks had come (we had ordered the 3-course meal, so we were awaiting our appetizers which they claimed would only take a few minutes). Visibly frustrated at this point, especially because we had seen other parties be seated later than us and already have their appetizers AND their main dish, we had to again ask about our appetizers. They profusely apologized (and even brought us an extra appetizer on the house), but we had tickets to a show later that night and didn't have the time to keep waiting. We were an hour into the reservation and hadn't even had a bite of our food. Now the good - the food was absolutely incredible. The eggplant chaat, the murgh tikka, the chicken gassi, the lamb chops, and the dessert were all exquisite. It didn't seem to matter what we ordered, we somehow would always end up in awe of the food's perfection. I would have, without any thought, given this place 5 stars if the service was even mediocre, simply passable. But because of the horrendous service (and being late for our show), I deducted a few stars.",0,0,1,Nika M.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",287,14,2
4.0,2/28/2018,"I loved the food here, though the service was disorganized. They need to understand that getting Americans tipsy is a good thing for their business. Get the drinks out! Offer more. There's some kind of disconnect here between the servers and ambition to serve.  However I perceived a Nepali edge that I really enjoyed. Dishes are unique. Everything was superb. A little unusual. Nepali influence probable.  Lamb shank could satiate a hungry soldier on his death bed. Kind of Fred Flintstone. Enjoy!",4,0,1,Larisa O.,"Chicago, IL",107,135,92
3.0,2/28/2018,"It breaks my heart to give this place three star especially considering everything I had heard everything about this. I was just so excited. We didn't have reservations so once we walked in we were asked to wait, which I am absolutely fine with. What threw me off was that there were plenty of tables empty. When we asked about the empty tables they said they were expecting people who made reservations. After 20 min they finally gave us a table, during which no one left and no one came. Infact I especially kept noting to see if actually someone shows up after us; there were a few people but small group of 2 people at max.This behavior absolutely threw me off. Do they just make people wait just to show off how busy they are.?! Now I'll get to food. I got my self the prestige lunch prix fixe: Lal mirch ka paneer and Hara Paneer Kofta. While the food was good, their naan exceptionally soft, there was nothing special or creative about any of the two dishes. My friend had ordered Chicken Gassi and they came back 5 min later telling it wasn't marinated so they can't offer that. Are you serious? You already have like 5 options in your menu and even they aren't available! Now, for the things that were actually good. The Ghost Chili Murg tikka is absolutely delicious! Malabar shrimp curry: I may be biased with this since I love coconut curry in general, but this dish was very beautifully made. Although again I have to say nothing creative about it. Tandoori octopus, well cooked, great flavors. Lamb chops: good quantity, well cooked with perfect blend of spices. The pineapple added a great flavor to the lamb. The Drunken Cake is the most amazing dessert here. I highly recommend trying this. My overall review, our server was definitely very nice and humble, but the overall experience just didn't give me a feel that am sitting in a Michelin Star restaurant. I probably am not going back.",2,5,1,Anisha R.,"Manhattan, NY",171,308,1230
3.0,2/19/2018,"It's a bit sad that I have to downgrade my rating of Junoon on my second visit here. We had high expectations from the main dining room after enjoying our first experience in the Patiala lounge, but the visit left us a bit underwhelmed.We came here to try the restaurant week menu. The food is good for an Indian place but didn't quite seem Michelin-star worthy. The RW menu is pretty much the main dining room menu but some of their best dishes are omitted - which kind of defeats the purpose. Also the service was good but not as attentive as we had hoped, leading us to believe we were getting a stepchild treatment of sorts.For cocktails we got the cola negroni (bitter with too much Campari in it) and the 27 West (smooth but a bit one-dimensional). For appetizers we tried the ghost chili kababs, which were way too spicy and hard to eat, and the eggplant chaat which could have done with a bit more spice and sauce. The green chutney we asked for didn't help much since they gave so little of it, and also tasted a bit spoilt. For mains we tried the Murgh Lababdar where the chicken had a nice smoky taste, and the Lal Mas which was hearty and good but a tad too garam-masala forward. Dessert was the Kulfi trio (alright) and the rice pudding, which was good. The masala chai marshmallow bites at the end were way too sweet and seemed gimmicky. Restaurant week ought to showcase the best that a restaurant has to offer, and sadly Junoon did not quite do that. For a high end restaurant with a Michelin star, I would expect above average food and service, but they failed to deliver on either front. Three stars but not worth the hype - the Patiala Lounge is a better bet.",2,2,1,Melville G.,"New York, NY",124,361,697
3.0,2/17/2018,"Junoon is a high end Indian place.  It's an odd uneven experience.  Decor: The space is cavernous and comfortable but if you go to the bathroom you're stepping in to a disgusting unkempt space.  There's some polish that needs to be done here.Service:  It's attentive enough, but they don't seem to delineate table ownership, so we got asked if we were ready to order twice.  I also got asked if I wanted a refill on my cocktail three times when I'd already requested another.  Bizarre.  Food:  The quality of the cooking and ingredients is very good.  I can see why Junoon has a Michelin star, at least for the cooking, but a few complaints.  1) Serving sizes are individual (small), but the way the meal is presented you'd almost want to eat it family style instead.  This was not communicated to us.  You'd almost want to order more mains than you have people, that's not how this was priced or presented.  2) You have to tone down the sauce even more, we can't taste the quality of your high end ingredients.  Honestly Junoon is already less sauce then a lot of Indian I eat, but it's still too much given for what they're trying to do with the cuisine.  If you're going continue what you're doing here you need to increase the quantities of food.3) Fix your servers.  Hire a new head of house and train them to own individual tables.  Delineate between bus-boys and waiters.4) Cocktails - insanely small.    Overall Junoon was pricey at around $100 a person (including tip) for four dinners, two appetizers and four cocktails.  Given price per quality I'll not be returning in the short term.",0,0,0,Alex R.,"Jersey City, NJ",2,50,0
3.0,2/15/2018,"Had high expectations for this michellin Star restaurant but was disappointed - mostly by the shockingly tiny size of my main dish.  Came in for lunch and chose the pricier pre fixe.  Started out with a tandoori salmon/beet appetizer which had a nice presentation and was perfectly cooked.  My main dish, black bass, was minuscule.  Less than two square inches.  Smallest portion of fish that I ever saw in my life - smaller than on any tasting menu, etc.  It wasn't even good either - a very boring dish that I'd never order again.  $37 for two dishes didn't even seem like a good deal considering the size and taste of my main dish.  The warm naan, however, was totally delicious!  I could go for that any day.  The service was also pretty slow.  I'd consider trying Junoon again, and would just stay far away from the black bass!",0,0,1,Marissa S.,"Manhattan, NY",17,267,285

3.0,2/13/2018,"I don't know how many restaurants I've eaten at but the Junoon hostess is actually the worst I've ever encountered.I tried calling for a lunch reservation and was told there was no space until 2. I checked open table and there was 12, 12:30, and 1 available. If the restaurant prefers to give a portion of my check to OpenTable, then I guess that's their choice.When we arrived, the hostess was very high up on her horse and said, at 12:03 for what was a noon reservation, that we needed to check in on one of the diners who hadn't arrived yet, because she would give away the table if he didn't show up soon. He ended up arriving at 12:05. Catastrophe averted.While waiting during those 2 minutes for him to arrive, the hostess also turned away a walk-in diner looking for a table for 2, saying they were fully booked, despite the restaurant having literally 4 people inside at the time and they looked to have capacity for 100+ including bar seating. It was a shocking news development that plenty of seats remained available throughout the entire noon-1:30 window that we were there.Food was pretty good though! Chicken and fish dishes were pretty flavorful. Naan and rice had nice texture. Rest of the waitstaff were a little stiff but still polite.

3.0,2/10/2018,"Average food, beautiful presentation and exceptional service- we took the pre fixe lunch menu, which had 3 courses.First course - The Ghost chili Murgh tikka was delicious. The chicken pieces were soft and succulent and had that amazing charred flavor that you get from the tandoor. It was true to its name , it was very spicy but it went well with the sweet cashew crumble and cashew sauce. This was the best course Second course - we ordered the paneer pukhtaan, murgh lababdaar and shrimp malabari. All three dishes were just about okay. The chicken was succulent and well cooked but the flavors failed to impress me. Shrimp Malabari had a nice coconuty flavor but it was too sweet for my taste. Lastly the paneer was just plain and bland. I would skip the paneer for sure.Third course- this was the worst! The ma ki kheer lacked sweetness and the combination of black pepper and other flavors didn't go well. The kulfi platter was something that you could get at any other Indian restaurant. I was expecting a lot from this course but it was a total let down.I would go to Junoon for its exceptional service not for the food!",0,0,0,Abhilasha S.,"Jersey City, NJ",57,32,83

I didn't really set my expectations too high because its Indian food and I literally eat this stuff everyday but wow, was I blown away. I am a vegetarian so I definitely appreciated the variety of vegetarian items on the menu. For appetizer, I got the eggplant chaat... amazing. Perfectly crisp thin eggplant slices topped with raita, onions, tamarind chutney, and garnished with cilantro. I got the methi aloo palak for the main dish and it was served with naan and rice. Every bite had SO much flavor and it just got better and better. I literally had to stop myself from overeating - that's how good it was. For the dessert, I got the delicious rice pudding which had a surprising twist with the caramelized banana and spices. Whenever I go out to eat, I always have a hard time completely finishing my food... at Junoon, I literally cleaned my plate. The service was amazing as well.

I was expecting more from the main courses and the dessert since this is a Michelin star restaurant. I tried the Lamb Rogan Josh - lamb was cooked really well but the dish didn't wow me. Just like eating at any other Indian restaurant? The Kulfi for dessert also seemed very  low effort. The courses didn't pair well together. Even though I loved the Ghost Chili chicken and the paneer appetizer it seemed strange to be eating that as an appetizer.

All dishes were so perfectly seasoned and very well portioned. This is Indian food...so yes, most dishes here have a kick to it and you should be mindful of that. However, the knowledgeable waiters work with you to decide on a preferred heat level if spicy isn't your thing.Our entrees ranged from the Malabar shrimp, the lamb chops, and the lobster but the Lal Mas REALLY stood out. All dishes came with rice and naan. The curry for the Malabar shrimp had a lovely coconut flavor and the shrimps were succulent. The desserts were perfect as well - especially the Shahi Tukra & Ma's rice pudding. Another thing I really liked was the excellent timing between dishes. No dish took too long to come out and the servers didn't rush us between dishes either.

3.0,2/3/2018,"Solid 3.5 stars from dining here for dinner during restaurant week. The 3 course dinner was the standard $42 and we also opted for the wine pairing for an additional $29.We sat immediately after arriving just on time for an 8:15 res. There was a decent number of menu options (4-5apps/entrees and then two dessert choices). I started with the house made cheese and fig chutney. There was a bit of heat to this dish and it's a good serving of cheese! The cheese texture was a mix between feta and goat but taste was very unique. Really enjoyed this and the glass of red really did balance out the spices. My bf got the eggplant chaat (fried eggplant coins) and said it was perfect with the white wine they served it with. Then we both went with the lamb entree and the table shared rice and naan. This was served with another red. The lamb was supposedly spicy but I found the heat very tolerable/not really there. The portion of the lamb was probably not as large as it would be as an entree a la carte. It was super tender but not incredible flavor wise. For dessert I got the kulfi which was served with a moscato type wine and my bf for the Indian rice pudding which was served with a port. Although the wine did go well with the kulfi, I personally am not a fan of sweet dessert wines. The kulfi came in 3 types (yellow ish mango, green licorice flavor?, and a pink strawberry). Didn't love the kulfi but it was my first time having this Indian ice cream so not much to compare to. The rice pudding was the way to go!Overall surprised Junoon has 1 Michelin star.

Appetizers and Mango Margarita were the highlights (I went for paneer and my friend ordered shrimps), but our main dish, monkfish curry, was extraordinary mediocre, far below a fish curry in any good Indian thali joint. The server couldn't tell which style of curry it was in the first place.  The dessert, kulfi, was also very simply presented and underwhelming, but edible. Wine pairing, although not that expensive, consisted of very cheap and uninteresting wines and glasses were tiny, literally maybe a half or even a third of a normal glass (if these are degustation portions it should have been stated in the menu). It was a restaurant week dinner menu, but I doubt that the usual menu would be that different. I don't understand how this place managed to keep its Michelin star and I will not return (also, as someone mentioned above, toilets were unclean and smelly).

Right away I could tell the decor was dated and tired looking. A visit to the restrooms turned into a horrible experience as it was dirty and dimly lit. No toilet paper in 2 stalls and unclean? Don't the Michelin inspectors ever visit bathrooms? On the plus side the cocktails were good and the Lucha paratha and onion kulcha were hot and fresh. On the minus side was everything else including a greasy zucchini pilaf, a mediocre shrimp curry and way below average shishito pakoras. Even the dessert of the 4 Kulfis was disappointing.

5.0,12/15/2017,"We had heard about Junoon from few friends and being an indian food lover, always wanted to try it out. We finally got to go for Saturday lunch on our recent trip on NYC. We made our reservation on Friday evening and luckily there was were lot of time slots open for Saturday lunch but if you are planning to go for dinner then I would suggest making reservations much in advance.  They have two dining options- Patiala room and main dining room. Main dining room which is more of a formal area is not open for lunch. For lunch they have three options- 1st is ala carte, 2nd is lunch prie Fixe which has 2 courses for $25 or 3 for $30 and 3rd is Prestige lunch prie fixe which has 2 courses for $37 or 3 for $42. Both 2nd and 3rd option include 1 appetizer, 1 entree served with basmati rice and naan and 1 dessert.Since there were just 2 of us and we wanted to try most of things, I opted for lunch prie fix 2 course and my husband opted for prestige prie fix menu 3 course.For appetizers, we ordered ghost chili murgh tikka and lal Mirch ka paneer. Chicken was perfectly marinated and cooked. Paneer was super soft and just melted in mouth. Never had such soft paneer in the US. Also, ordered crispy eggplant chaat separately because of such high reviews on yelp. It's an interesting concept with fried eggplant instead of papd in chaat. For main course, we ordered murgh lababdar and hara paneer kofta. Both were nice but next time my choice would be chicken instead of paneer dish. The rice and breads served with these dishes were sufficient for both of us. We also ordered dal makhani on the side which was pretty good. For dessert, we ordered kulfi in which we got to try 4 flavors- cardamom, paan, rose and mango! The kulfi was outstanding!!! M happy that we got to try all 4 of them. Cardamom was my least favorite but rest 3 were just so full of flavor woh perfect level of sweetness. Overall, if you are craving for good Indian food, it's is the place to go to!!

There are three choices for selections on the menu.The $85 5 course selections, the $75 3 course selection and you can order everything on themenu individually. All the persons at the table must order in the manor. We went for the three course menu. Appetizers consisted of deep fried mushrooms, smoked heavily spiced spareribs, little shrimps and deep fried collyfloeur. All were very well prepared and had intense flavors. Main courses consisted of tandoori chicken with a wonderful flavor and aroma. Sea bass especially well prepared and very flavorful and salmon equally as well presented. You also receive your choice of breads, rice and Dahl. We had deserts of ""drunken"" cake with with whisky ice-cream assorted sorbets and a truly fantastic rice pudding.

4.0,12/9/2017,"Where do I even begin. I came to Junoon with my family and my roommate's family to celebrate our White Coat ceremony for medical school back in August. After hearing one of our friends rave about this place, we figured we'd give it a shot - plus, we were celebrating, so why the heck not? We started off at the bar where the drinks being poured were AMAZING. My mom ordered a drink that had paan infused into it, and I swear I was so tempted to order one for myself instead of scotch.On to the food. There are no words that can suffice to explain how good it was. Maybe the drinks had me feeling extra good or something, but when I say I thoroughly enjoyed dinner that night, I seriously mean it. We ordered items ranging from vegetarian malai kofta to non-vegetarian lamb curry, and every bite was licked clean from my plate. The portions were on the smaller side, but the quality of the food made up for it. My biggest recommendation to anyone wanting to dine here is to make sure you know what you're in for. This is not your typical uncle-aunty Desi restaurant; it's a classy, well-known establishment, and the ambience and pricing definitely reflects that. Be sure to check out the menu beforehand if you're on a budget, or you're a broke medical student who can only go to places like this when his parents are in town and will pay for it ;) I definitely recommend checking out Junoon on your next visit to NYC (and then head over to 230 Fifth Rooftop Bar right around the corner for killer views of the city, especially during the warm months).",2,0,0,Darshan P.,"Canton, MI",2,19,0

Since we were dining to celebrate my friends birthday they gave us an additional chocolate/hazelnut cake plus the two desserts we ordered- kulfi and rice pudding.

3.0,11/27/2017,"I've heard great things about Junoon, but also heard that it has declined over the years. After having it on my to visit list for a couple years now, we finally got a chance during a birthday lunch for a family member. We weren't entirely sure of how the crowds would be, so we made sure to make reservations online. We chose the earliest time slot of noon on a Sunday. We were the first ones to arrive and then a couple more folks started trickling in, most it seemed without a reservation. Still, most of the Patiala Room was empty during our lunch. If you're looking to make a reservation, you have two room options depending on the meal. The Patiala Room, which we were in is open for both lunch and dinner and seems to meant for a fairly informal/ casual experience. The Main Dining Room only serves dinner and seems to have a few requirements to dine here, it's also where the tasting menu is served and more of a formal, proper dining experience. No children under 13 are allowed in the Main Dining Room. For lunch, we opted for the Lunch Prix Fixe which has the option of two course for $25 it three courses for $30, we went for the latter. Given that there were six of us, we split the vegetarian dishes so that we could try them all--there were two vegetarian dishes for appetizer and two for the main entree. For appetizers, we ordered the Eggplant Chaat (crispy eggplant, raita, tamarind chutney, red onion, chaat masala) and Lahsooni Gobi (crispy cauliflower, tomato-garlic chili chutney). The right choice here is clearly the Eggplant Chaat, it's delicious, light and has an airy crunchiness to it. The Lahsooni Gobi is a bit plain and bland, but its highlight is the tangy tomato-garlic chili chutney. I ordered the Adraki Punch (Fig-infused vodka, lemon, grapefruit, honey-ginger syrup) ($15) for my drink. It was absolutely delicious, a bit tangy but also sweet with subtle hints of citrus and ginger. It was a fairly small quantity but strong!For the main course, we ordered the Nadru Marat Makhana (crispy lotus root, english peas, roasted tomato sauce, puffed lotus seed) and the Paneer Pukhtan (paneer, pumpkin, tomato). Neither was particularly impressive, but the Nadru Marat Makhana is the way to go if you have to choose between the two. It has an unique style and decor to it, with the lotus root designed into creative shapes, and has a delicious bitter crunchy taste to it. The Paneer Pukhtan is certainly unique compared to other Paneer dishes at other restaurants, particularly having a fragrant taste to it that I found a bit off putting. It also has pumpkin seeds, which was an interesting and nice compliment to the dish. For dessert, we ordered Ma's Rice Pudding (candied almonds, puffed rice, caramelized bananas) and the Kulfi Ice Cream. The Kulfi is the way to go on this one. The Rice Pudding was ok with interesting ingredients like a caramel used banana and pomegranate seeds but nothing special. Overall, everything from the food to the service was underwhelming. I most likely will not be going back to Junoon--I look forward to trying some of the other Michelin rated Indian restaurants in New York City like Tamarind and Accent, and would recommend first time diners looking at Junoon to do the same.",10,6,6,Amit J.,"Jersey City, NJ",1766,210,615

It pretty much felt like they didn't want to have customers there. Second, the menu seems to work in a bizarre fashion. Apparently either each person on the table orders from the pre-fixed menu options or everyone has to go à la carte. You can't do a combination, which can be extremely annoying if you are a larger party and/or some of you are vegetarian. Also, pre-fixed options are for 1 person so it's ""not allowed"" to share on the table. That at least is what one of the extremely rude servers, who took our order, told us. Can't share?

The service is good but a bit too invasive and disrupting. The kulfi ice cream was outstanding, I give them credit for that. We had the chilly chicken which tasted like steamed chicken with some tabasco sauce poured on top. The lamb shank was good, but I have had much better in terms of flavors and temperature of the food served, as well as the plating. The naan is crispy and thin which is the way it supposed to be. I can see glimpses of a bygone era for this restaurant. however, now its downhill in terms of quality. However, it seems to be a spot for stressed out New Yorkers.

However, the decor was plain ol' banquet hall vibe. I was expecting the ambiance and decor to have more substance, but it didn't ""wow"" me. My sister and I started off with some cocktails. We ordered the Adraki Punch and   Arya Stark (two thumbs for creative Game of Thrones theme). We both enjoyed the Adraki Punch, but not so much of the Arya Stark. On to the food - we started off with some eggplant chaat, which I was most excited about and my sister ordered the ghost chili murgh tikka. While I definitely enjoyed the eggplant chaat, the ""oily"" flavor was a bit overpowering. I also think that adding green chutney or red garlic chutney would have amped it up. I can also probably make this at home and make it more flavorful. My sister thought the ghost chili murgh tikka was delicious and well spiced. For mains, we ordered the hara paneer kofta and butter roti. We both thought the dish lacked a lot of flavor. The koftas were perfectly soft, but the spinach portion was not salted properly (coming from someone that prefers less salt in general). Its possible that the flavors are geared towards certain type of diners and not exactly for those who know and expect real Indian flavors. Regardless, we found it disappointing. The roti portions were very small compared to most places (that's what you get in ""fancy"" places... I guess). So, we ended up ordering garlic naan - which was more flavorful than the kofta dish... which says a lot. We finished our meal by ordering the chocolate sooji cake, which comes with kesar ice cream. Neither of us thought it was great. We found the cake a bit salty... and I did not like the ice cream as the kesar flavor was very strong (though my sister didn't mind). I wouldn't order this again. They were also nice to give us some cookies made in house, which I thought were great. In general, service was great, the food not so much. The price is also not worth it. Did my expectations live up to the hype? Ehh... not really. This is most definitely not on my top list of restaurants for Indian food.",0,0,0,Dee P.,"Manhattan, NY",153,34,8

The appetizers on the prix fixe were awesome! Ghost pepper murgh and paneer were both spicy and flavorful.For main dishes we ordered lamb and chicken, which were both good - more like your standard Indian take out, not as creative as the apps - and came with rice and naan. Dessert was a saffron dish, kind of like a pudding. It was artistically swept across the plate and garnishing was attractive.

The service was atrocious on a weekday evening and the staff extremely inattentive. The manager did apologize to us at the end of the meal and attributed the subpar service to the restaurant being understaffed that day, which I find to be inexcusable for a Michelin-starred restaurant.

4.0,9/13/2017,"I recently had the pleasure of enjoying Junoon for lunch after attending a nearby convention.  The atmosphere and décor of the restaurant is elegant but relaxed.  The main dining room is spacious with table settings that look like oasis offering privacy to the dining party.  The service was adequate with wait staff checking in appropriately and timely. There is a pre-fix menu of 3 dishes for $30 or 2 dishes for $25 or a la carte lunch menu.  My company and I selected from the pre-fix menu individual dishes which we both got to share!  Perfect! We chose light appetizers, Eggplant Chaat and Lahsooni Gobi; the first was light crisp eggplant served with a tamarind chutney; the Lahsooni was cauliflower like I never had!  They were round shaped, crisp outer layer with amazingly moist center served with a delicious very slightly spiced chili chutney; absolutely amazing!!!  As main dishes, my partner selected the Murg Lababdar and me, the Malabari Shrimp; the first consisted of tandoori chicken pieces cooked with delectable tomato sauce; the shrimp was served with a coconut, mustard seed curry sauce which had just the right amount of spiciness; both dishes were accompanied by Basmati rice and Naan.  Absolutely delicious, the Naan was outstanding!  For dessert; we chose Kulfi and Rice Pudding; the Kulfi or ice cream were two dainty scoops of Mango and Paan Leaf fruit, the rice pudding was delicate with just the right amount of sweetness.   Overall, Junoon in my opinion offered a small taste of great Indian cuisine with authentically cooked dishes with a somewhat subdue spiciness to please all.",1,0,1,Patricia P.,"Parlin, NJ",235,202,931

4.0,8/13/2017,"- Summer restaurant week 2017 -I went with a couple of friends for restaurant week lunch ($29), and my experience was quite good though not amazing. The waitstaff was extremely courteous and helpful, explained the menu very well, and answered all of our questions; they also refilled the water frequently. This was one of the better restaurant week experiences I've had, though I'm not sure I would come here at the regular price especially since the entrees weren't impressive; it didn't meet my expectations for a Michelin-starred restaurant, and if it weren't restaurant week prices the rating would be a star lower. The portions appeared small but were extremely filling. Highlights were the naan and the saffron shrikhand.Appetizers:- Ghost chili murgh tikka - chicken is so tender and well spiced. It's not too spicy (slightly more than medium) and I really liked the accompanying cabbage and crumbled cashew- Saloni macchi - honestly this didn't stand out to me and I thought the salmon was a bit dry- Lal mirch ka paneer - didn't try this but my friend really liked itMain:- Murg lababdar - didn't stand out; I liked the tomato sauce more than the chicken, especially with the naan. The chicken was tender, and the sauce was somewhat sweet. The mains come with basmati rice and the softest, most pillowy naan - skip the rice (it's just average) and go straight for the naan - it's like eating buttery carby clouds- Lamb rogan josh - my friend got this and I only tried a little of the sauce; tasty but not very spicyDeserts:- Saffron shrikhand - sweetened yogurt with saffron and candied almonds and pistachios on top, I got this on the waiter's recommendation and I'm so glad I did. The yogurt is so delicious and fragrant, the textural contrast from the candied nuts is really nice, and I was simultaneously really sad and satisfied when I finished it.- Duo of kulfi - Indian ice cream, comes in mango and paan leaf flavors. The paan one seemed too frozen (we couldn't cut it down the middle but had to slowly scrape off the sides) and we generally didn't enjoy the flavor.

We got the egg plant crips (with tangy sauce and yoghurt) which was great. The Mirchi Bhajji was also great, crispy, packed with flavor. We also liked the grilled chicken. Main Course:We found the main course underwhelming. The presentation of food was great but the three of us had better/tasty experience at in-expensive restaurants already. We got the Dal Makhni, Yellow Dal, Roti, Garlic Naan, three gravy based curries. We all had better versions for cheap prices in NYC already. This was the first Michelin Star restaurant experience for all of us; We liked the overall experience, but the food is way too overpriced for the taste. I agree that a lot goes into the rents, salaries of skilled chefs, but my opinion is the main course didn't deserve a Michelin star.Desserts:The three Desserts that we ordered were great. They were presented awesomely in various kinds of plates. The Ma's rice pudding was the best (Recipe of Chef's mum).Overall, I wouldn't recommend this place to students or someone who wants authentic taste of Indian cuisine.

2.0,7/31/2017,"We ordered the tasting menus here, and on the whole were disappointed. The meal starts off well and gets progressively worse.The appetizers were actually competent. In particular the eggplant chaat to start was simply excellent. The dish is a papdi chaat that uses the eggplant to make the papdi; it was crisp and well flavored, and the dish was very enjoyable. A great start. The mirch pakora was fine, though not remarkable either. The salmon (saloni macchi) that you can pick instead was yummy. Get this. The lal mirch paneer and ghost pepper murgh tikka were both good tandoori-style dishes. One would prefer not to get them both, one after the other, since they're so similar (tandoori, peppers). Unfortunately the alternative for the chicken course, a plantain/fig tikki, is truly horrible - you can't really appreciate either the fig or plantain, and it's just a soggy and uninspired tikki. You'd get better from any street vendor in India. Still, the meal so far was quite decent.The main course was a catastrophe. Truly I've never eaten a paneer dish this bad. It had an unpleasant one-note flavor and we were actually unable to finish it. The other option was a lamb lal maas, and we were told they were ""out of it."" Seriously. We had a 7.30 evening reservation, and it seems absurd to be ""out"" of your big main course item in a tasting menu. We were offered a lamb rogan josh as a replacement. This somehow managed to fuse two opposite kinds of badness into one dish. The lamb was overcooked and drying, while the gravy was sharp and had undercooked spices.The tasting menu only offered the one dessert option which seems a tad restrictive. Howerver the waiter was very nice and allowed us to pick two others that were on the restaurant week menu. The shrikhand was yummy. There was also a kulfi trio which had one yummy (elaichi) and two atrocious flavors (paan, tamarind).

2.0,6/18/2017,"This isn't the first time that I've had dinner in Junoon, but this was the worst experience there by far. My friend and I had dinner there on a Friday night without reservations. This started out well. We were accommodated quickly, and the service was respectful and cordial. However, when we finally finished our main meal, it immediately turned sour. The waiters and waitresses continued to ignore us as they went to obviously accommodate the larger groups. We understand that they would have less tips at our table since there were only 2 of us, but for a 4/5-star restaurant, you'd expect better service than this. 30 minutes later, after one of the larger groups dispersed, our waiter finally decided it was time to offer us dessert after half an hour of waiting. We respectfully declined. It was a waste of time and really soured our experience at Junoon. We love this restaurant but we'll probably do a double take going back here for a while.

He returned with a check that said ""3-course Prix Fixe @ $70 times 2.""  But we didn't order the Prix Fixe. We ordered ala carte. 2 courses and no dessert. We called over another waiter and told him what had happened and he ran back to fix it. When he came back he had our actual bill and said the waiter had given us the prix fixe price. But that price was more than our actual bill. ""But not much more,"" said the waiter. What?

5.0,6/9/2017,"My favorite Indian Restaurant -- with one quibble.  I have probably eaten here over twenty times over the past two years.  The food and atmosphere are excellent -- really, a fine dining experience.  Really amazing food.  Generally the service is excellent.  Literally, the best Indian restaurant I have been to anywhere. And this is not a neighborhood hang-out -- but a very nice dinner out experience.  Not quite as fancy as some of the old school French in the city (the few that remain), but it is a fine dining experience. Now for the quibble:   I sometimes like to order takeout as I sometimes only think about food when I am driving.  I called here once while driving and tried to order takeout -- but they insisted that I give a credit card # before accepting the order.  Now, if you are driving and using the car's speaker phone, the last thing you want to do is start reading the numbers off of a credit card -- that is probably worse than texting while driving.  Even though they had my phone no. in their system -- as I have been here repeatedly, they refused to let me pay when I got to the restaurant -- insisting that I give the cc no. over the phone.... To me, that is just not good customer service - and a bit arrogant.  I thought that that policy is just stupid, short-sighted and not customer friendly -- esp for patrons who are coming back and want to pick up food during their busy schedule.  I literally stayed away for several months in protest -- but the food is just too good -- so, I came back. Note: the back room is very formal, but the front room is more casual and comfortable.  Go to the back room if you want very well spaced tables and private conversation -- otherwise, I prefer the front room -- same food, but more comfortable and casual setting.",0,0,0,Michael James E.,"New York, NY",0,5,0

2.0,4/10/2017,"A little background of our dinner time spent there... We drove to NY from VA to meet Family who visited from AL for conference. It was our first family reunion after my BIL tied knot. We were excited to have it, at Junoon as this was the place I wanted to visit for a long time now after following Chef Vikas on social media. Our reservation was at 6 PM and we reached there at 5:40PM (way too early).We were greeted and seated right after we arrived. We had to wait  for 2 people that were supposed to join us(BIL and his wife). Unfortunately it took them long to join us (to be more precise they arrived at 7PM). Also to add I had my kids with me aged 3 yrs and 4 months. The restaurant does not seem to be kid friendly! No high chairs. We were fine with that as my toddler has hardly used one in a long time. But we got stares!! (not appreciated!) Whenever my baby (4 months old) cried I took her out in the lobby making sure I don't ruin anybody's evening in that restaurant.  As we were waiting for rest of the family to join us we couldn't order everything but we made sure we ordered drinks and appetizers. It was around 6:50PM that we (tried to) order one Entree as my toddler was really hungry. We mentioned that the people we are waiting for will be here in 5-10 mins and we will order rest of the things. BUT instead we were told we CAN NOT order just single entree. I insisted that the little one is hungry and hence we are ordering one and soon will order rest. BUT we were told we can't do that. I mean how on earth can Someone say NO to a Hungry Child?? That too I wasn't begging for food! I was paying for it! And let me tell you this that the restaurant wasn't completely full that we were holding table and making people wait outside! It was still 30% empty. The Server was good but I saw he was pressurized by somebody else (probably the manager, Who never had a friendly face the entire time we were there). Food was good. But this total experience gave a bitter taste to everything!

3.0,2/21/2017,"Rating: 3.5/5        Junoon had been on my ""I should visit this soon"" list ever since Sam Sifton's review came out in early 2011. In the years since, a lot has changed. It is now one among the only two Indian restaurants with a Michelin star in NYC, and Vikas Khanna is a much more recognized name in Indian fine dining circuit than it used to be. After many years of indecisiveness, I finally made a reservation here during Restaurant Week' 17. I should admit, Junoon, located on W 24th St, is not ubiquitously revered among my Indian friends, and I was certain my snobbish palette will be enough to find flaws in the dishes. As it turned out, I was immensely pleased with almost every single dish that I tried.       I stood outside for a few minutes waiting for my friends (who per usual were running late), gazing at the dark black, wooden exterior. During evenings, a large, white, illuminated name sign casts a beautiful shadow on the exterior but it also trims the opulence of this place. I walked inside; deciding to wait for my friends in the warm lobby instead of waiting outside in freezing cold. The lobby is a small, cozy place with a few sofas and a small window on the right with a coat closet on its other side.       A few minutes later, after a quick coat check, my friends and I were promptly seated in the Patiala Room. Honestly, though, the main dining room, with ceiling to floor curtains, a wine cellar, beautiful yellow lighting, and sparsely placed tables is a far more elegant affair than the Patiala room outside. We ordered Eggplant chaat, Lahsooni Gobi, Ghost Chili Murgh Tikka for our first course. Eggplant chaat, with thinly sliced eggplant fried in corn flour with yogurt and tamarind chutney on top, had the perfect amount of tanginess (which should be expected from a chaat dish). Lahsooni Gobi, fried cauliflower draped in tomato, garlic, chili chutney, however, was underwhelming. Ghost Chili Murgh Tikka had wonderfully tender chicken thigh pieces placed atop a layer of spaghetti squash, and a dash of pistachio puree on their periphery. I should point out that even though the dish is named ""Ghost Chili (Ghost Pepper) Murgh Tikka"", it lies in the tolerable region of spiciness spectrum. For our mains, we ordered Paneer Pukhtan and Murgh Lababdar.  Paneer Pukhtan - with cubes of cottage cheese and pumpkin seeds sprinkled over them - was savory. Rice that came along with it, on the other hand, was undercooked. I would highly recommend eating Paneer Pukhtan with Cheese Naan instead. Murgh Lababdar - Tandoori chicken dipped in curry with a noticeable amount of fenugreek - was a little below my expectations. Sadly, tomato puree in that curry overpowered all other ingredients. And for desserts, we chose Spiced Chocolate and Phirni. Saffron cardamom phirni with small scoops of mango creme was my favorite. Spiced chocolate - chai ice cream with masala streusel and a thin, almost transparent, slice of pear - was equally good.       After our dinner, we decided to take a look at Spice Room located on lower level. A narrow staircase on the right side of main dining room leads to a small room in the basement. A large glass pane, behind which lies a rack of glass containers with an array of spices/condiments in them, provides patrons a glimpse into the wide gamut of flavors that Junoon uses in its offerings.       What I didn't like, however, and will probably be the reason why I will be hesitant to come back to this place in future is the extremely sub-par service. In the two or so hours we spent at Junoon, we were asked if we were enjoying our meal etc. etc. a grand total of zero times and I can assure you this was not because the staff was busy. There were barely 3-4 other tables that were occupied in the entire room. After our lunch, my friend asked for coffee/tea options and the server replied that they were not on the menu. I could have sworn I saw tea, coffee, cappuccino on the menu we were given when we sat down.  Overall, even though I was pretty content with what I had in terms of food, I did not like the experience. It just seemed out of place for a Michelin starred restaurant. It just seemed...mechanical.",0,0,0,Brown B.,"NY, NY",0,2,13

We tried the eggplant chaat and lasooni gobhi for the appetizers. The chaat was not consistent - a few bites I felt underwhelmed on the yogurt and some overwhelmed with spices. Lasooni gobhi was done well, and I really loved its flavor. However, I felt portions were small for both the appetizers. For the main course, I tried Dal Makhani and Hara Paneer Kofta - and I must acknowledge both these entrees were top notch. I really loved that dal makhani was subtle but hit the palate a little later. Hara paneer kofta would just melt in the mouth and a delicacy. Missi roti was not a very good option since it was hard and not served hot enough. For the dessert, we got the spiced chocolate which definitely deserved 5 stars. The combination of masala chai flavor with a chocolate ice cream was a real winner for my taste buds. There were multiple places where I felt service was sloppy - One instance where a server was completely casual on placing the dishes aptly on the table, and a second instance where a restaurant staff was too close and obtrusive while attending an adjoining table.I felt the price was little steep looking at appetizer portions, service, and overall experience compared to some other Michelin star restaurants I have tried.

We ordered several of the vegetarian dishes off the 3 course prix fixe menu along with the additional wine pairing option for each course. I was just as pleased with the wine selections. Service was also top notch. They were able to accommodate my dietary restrictions with replacing the naan with an eggless alternative, and throughout the night, my water glass never reached empty.

4.0,2/3/2017,"$42 for dinner at a Michelin starred restaurant? Thanks restaurant week! Fairly easy to get a dinner reservation for 6 a week in advance using open table. The restaurant itself is absolutely gorgeous, and the coat check and white tablecloths are a nice touch. The food and drinks came out slower than expected which made our meal last about 2 hours. However, the manager and waiters kept checking on us and changing silverware and plates for each course. Loved that!Food wise, my absolute favorites were the ghost chili chicken appetizer, murgh lababdar for the entree and spiced chocolate for dessert. The lamb curry fell a little short for me because of the smoky taste. Other dishes I liked included the coconut shrimp curry and salmon appetizer. All the cocktails we tried were delicious.

3.0,2/2/2017,"Fairly disappointing dinner.  This was our second visit here (first after they changed around the menu format) and I am underwhelmed.  It seems as if the service, menu selection, portion sizes, and ambiance have all taken a turn for the worse.  We started with the mirchi pakora (shishito peppers), Lal Mitch Ka Paneer (paneer with fig and fig sauce), and Junoon  spiced naan (cheese and zaatar).  Shishitos were tasty and generous, paneer came with three pieces in a sweet and dish sauce, and the naan was greasy and doughy and had a slight cheese taste.The main dishes were small but made for an ok family style meal.  We ordered 4 dishes for 4 people - my favorite was the Paneer Puhktan - pumpkin and tomato sauce.  The goat was terrible and a few pieces were all bone and cartilage in a sauce that was just not spiced to my taste and felt grainy and unbalanced.  The yellow daal was bland and lukewarm.  The rice was hard and tasteless and a very small portion.  Garlic naan was nothing special, as was the shrimp.  The Patiala room, where we were seated, felt like a dark and loud bar.  Not great.  It was hard to hear the servers and they seemed a bit apathetic anyhow.  So sad, as our dinner here during our last trip to NYC was a standout.  I am hoping they will take note (I see I am not the only one feeling this way) and step back up to their previous game.",2,0,1,Marisa S.,"Charleston, SC",191,185,177

4.0,1/31/2017,"High quality Indian food in a nice ambience, with ONLY 3 course prix fixe option for $70 without tax and service. I came here with my colleagues for team dinner as it has great vegetarian options. The place was very spacious, the ambience was very nice and calming. There was a coat check in the very front, which was very considerate especially in the cold winter days. The service was very good, as they kept on checking on us how we were doing and pouring water. We ordered a bottle of wine and the wine guy was very pro in all the etiquettes. The service was on par with its price level and my bosses and colleagues were really satisfied.Now talk about food. We were 8 people and we got the prix fixe individually but we decided to share everything in family style so I was happy to try most kinds. I am really bad with the name of the dish as they are so hard to remember so I will just describe the dishes: [Appetizers]Good:- Saloni macchi: very delicious grilled salmon with refreshing pickle and onion; tender and crispy at the same time- Ghost chilli chicken tikka: very tasty but also VERY SPICY! Chicken was super tender and delicious but the moment you were appreciating the taste you were overwhelmed by how spicy it was. Good but cautious if your spiciness-tolerance level is low.- Lamb wrapped in bread: lamb was well cooked and the sauce blended well with lambWeird:- Black chicken: The chicken was wrapped in unknown suspicious black substance that you might doubt if it is edible. It is basically looks like charcoal and more bizarrely, it also tastes like charcoal. The chicken was alright but the powdery texture was kinda making me feel I was actually eating charcoal.[Main course]Good:- Shrimp in curry sauce: shrimp was very tender and the sauce was just right - not too spicy but flavorful enough- Black bass: fried bass in creamy coconut sauce, which balances well with the crispy coat- Chicken biryani: very flavorful; chicken was very tender- Lamb shack: very big portion and very tender, well-cooked lamb soaked in spices; mixes perfectly with yogurt- Side dishes: along with the main courses there comes naan bread and lentil as well as yogurt. Garlic naan was HEAVEN and the combination with yogurt was PARADISE. Make sure you get both of them![Dessert]Good:- Rice pudding: the taste is JUST RIGHT - very creamy but not too sweet; the right cold temperature to seal a good meal and to refresh slightly from the heavy Indian food coma- Kulfi: you got 3 flavors of ice-cream all of which are with special Indian spicesAlright:- Spicy chocolate: basically tastes like brownie; the only good thing about it is the chai ice-creamThe meal was HUGE and I was having serious food coma afterwards.They used to have a la carte option but now they only do prix fixe, which is a bit inconvenient for group doing family style. Despite, it turned out to be a very successful team dinner and everyone was very satisfied and happy about the ambience, food and drink.

I easily would have paid double for what I got. The ghost chili chicken appetizer was the highlight of my life. The spice was clean and sharp and hot but certainly not too hot. I was on a double date, and the rest of my party all had amazing appetizers but mine just blew me away. The lamb curry I got for my entree was very good, but not life altering. I preferred my boyfriend's chicken curry. The entree came with rice and naan. I was amazed by the rice! I've never had more perfectly cooked and seasoned rice in my life! I could literally have eaten an entire meal of just that rice. Dessert was also good. I had a chocolate cake of sorts. It was nicely spiced and had a lovely texture. The service was also impeccable. Both of our servers were unobtrusive but friendly and attentive. The service was so good that when we talked to the manager afterwards about their fantastic demeanor. They really enhanced our experience. Their names were Taki and Brandon so if you see them say hi. I have nothing but praise for this restaurant.

1.0,1/12/2017,"Dear Vikas Khanna, Please use an ounce of your exceptional junoon to salvage the abysmal vegetarian selections on this menu, instead of spending all your passion on TV shows. It is quite likely, the meat and fish selections on this menu are outstanding but vegetarians are left short changed. For eg. hara paneer kofta is sheer disappointment, the worst green leaf prep I have tasted on any Indian menu in the city. Its a bland and over salted goo of green, with 4 oil laden dumplings, which dont do justice to the flavor or taste of paneer. Nadru matar, another downer. Makhana was difficult/ hard to chew BOTH times i have ordered it in recent visits, i had to spit it on the side. Makhana should hold its form while being tender to chew. The gravy is about as cookie cutter as it gets, a few lotus crisps dont elevate this to a refined level. Indian cuisine offers SO MUCH variety with vegetables and legumes, yet you find it necessary to repeat eggplant in appetizer and main selections. Some folks dont eat eggplant, it limits the already limited choice veggie menu even more by knocking two things straight. Mirchi pakodas - bland and uninspiring. With shishito peppers, chefs are using extraordinary imagination at other spots (Indian or otherwise).When I entertain non Indian clients at Junoon because it is indeed famous, the vegetarians are left underwhelmed. And then I spot you on TV showcasing your great skills, wonder, why isnt any of that reflected in the veggie options at Junoon?! Cheers",2,0,2,Gee m.,"Manhattan, NY",1,49,2

One would expect such a restaurant to not dupe it's customers. There is enough difference between a chutney and pickle (aachar).

1.0,11/23/2016,"Who gave them a Michelin star?? I wouldn't even give them a single star on Yelp if I had a choice! This place has become a sad dilapidated state of its former glorious self! What happened to this once wonderful full of class restaurant? We were greeted by this pungent aroma of Indian spices the second we entered the door to top it all off the floor in the casual lounge area was sticky (eww) and the chair I pulled had a stain !!!! Anyways still optimistic about the food we ignored these tell tale signs(wish we hadn't!) and ordered Lahsooni gobhi, chicken with ghost pepper tikka and a Kadak lamb seekh kebab. Ignoring the fact that there wasn't anything served on the table to nibble on and we waited and waited for our food to arrive.. And the food arrived I tried v hard to like something atleast something but no there wasn't even a slight element which I liked! The sauce on the gobhi tasted like a typical frozen Indian food (it had a stale pungent smell) the seekh kebab had a gamey smell and were quite hard and the ghost pepper chicken was well just spicy that's it! For mains we ordered Hara paneer kofta, the description on the menu looked like it would be a dish full of different flavors but I guess it was left to our imagination to imagine those things listed as it tsated just plain horribly TASTELESS!!!! And please don't be fooled by the super glamorous mughlai name of Chicken Lababdar, as u are just left finding the taste in that too! But yes one thing which did have a taste was Lal Mass and the taste it had was of mind blowing CHILLY!!!!! This dish should come with a warning  anyhow my rant is not going to stop here as the sparkling water which we ordered kept becoming flatter and flatter with every serving poured by the waiter! What a waste of a 200 something dollars and what a waste of time and what a waste of a restaurant!

2.0,11/21/2016,"Disappointed to say the least. We came here a few weeks ago on a not so busy day but the service was insanely slow. For a Michelin star rated restaurant I was highly unimpressed. I had been so excited to try this restaurant had been wanting to try for a really long time and had higher hopes. Not only was the service very slow the food wasn't anything special. I think the best part about going to this restaurant were the drinks that we had at the bar while waiting almost an hour and a half for our table- after being told it would only take 30 minutes. Unfortunately we went on a night where the option was only a pre fixed menu. The appetizers were decent. The eggplant chaat appetizer was something that stuck out to me as well as the cauliflower appetizer-- would recommend ordering this. Next the entrées came out which included different curries with naans. Every single one of them were too cold to the point we actually had to ask the waiter to go reheat them. I have to say though, the waiters were nice and tried to accommodate us when we weren't happy with something. Even after a slight discount on the bill due to our groups dissatisfaction the five of us still each spent around $120 which was definitely not repaid by the quality of the food. Also- a member in our group lost his jacket and tried contacting the restaurant several times with nothing but rude responses from the staff...

1.0,11/14/2016,"I had really high expectations with the michelin star and what not for this place. I took my mother in law for her birthday here. we had had a very long day walking around NY and we arrived 45 minutes early (we had reservations). When I went to the host and told her that we were early, she said I just have to wait in a very rude manner. I felt like I was burdening her with my question. So, I told her we will just go to the bar and get a drink and will come back at our reserved time and she literally  balked at me to tell me  I cannot go to the bar as there was a private event. So, I asked if there was something close by where we can get a drink, she ignored me and walked away. When she got back, completely ignoring me sitting there again, My mother in law went and asked her if there was a place we can get a drink while we wait, She was slightly nicer to her, and told her they will seat us soon. When we got seated, it took them atleast 20 minutes to get to our table with the menu and another 20 minutes or so for them to pay attention to us and come to get our order. AS we were ordering, the waiter walked in the middle of it randomly to seat someone else. He came back after almost 5 minutes and we went over the entire order again.Fast forward..Food arrives (some other person not our waiter got the food). But the order was completely wrong. So I told him that is not what we ordered to which he just mumbled something and walked away. I was in shock at this point and had to wave our waiter down, and explained the mistake. Finally we got our food but I have to say the quality is average. This was a long time ago and I do not remember what we had ordered but I wanted to write about the awful service we received.The only good thing that night was the person who was incharge of our wine. He was very nice, polite and was on his best step and was super attentive. He was always there when we needed a refill.I do not want to sound racist here, but I felt that way. The way the host balked at me while she was semi nice to my mother in law was kind of horrifying. I will mention this only because I am Indian and my mother in law is American.

The decor is very Buddahkhan/Hakkasan, with almost all of the Indian touch removed.Here's the rundown - Service in main dining room - 1 star, rarely do I see waiters who refuse to give you the food menu till you order drinks.  We used the excuse of wanting to order a la cart to get out of what could've ruined a dinner with a pompous waiter and moved to the more casual bar dining room- Service in the bar dining room was top notch - 5 stars.  Very attentive, and worked with allergies very thoughtfully.- Food... where do I even begin?  So confused.  My dish was like cream of mushroom paired with Roti (did I just pay what I think I did for what taste like Campbells cream of mushroom???) and the duck was like... duck confit, served with garlic naan.  The octopus was cold, soggy, way over salted... this is probably one of the worst meals in terms of food that I've had in recent memory, and it's such a shame with such a wonderful wait staff!I'm going back to my hood, where India Kitchen resides, until chef Vikas come back",4,0,2,Annie H.,"New York, NY",216,606,1799

Having said that, the tandoori octopus was blah but then we should've known better than to order octopus in an Indian restaurant.

Even when it did come back it was not ""hot"". Maybe serving in flat plates is not great of an idea as food cools really fast. They did bring a special dessert for my dad which was nice.

My server was an enthusiastic cocktail specialist, and he made me 2 excellent tequila based drinks during my dinner. Very unusual flavors which incorporated Indian spices. I ate the Ghost Chili tandor chicken dish to start. Super tender chunks of spicy chicken with a creamy pistachio sauce. That is a very special dish.My main course was also spicy - goat meat in a red chili curry sauce and garam masala. The dish was mostly bones, with very little edible goat meat. It had maybe 1/3 the amount of meat as  compared to my chicken appetizer. The flavor was good, and the sauce was wonderful - very spicy - but the lack of meat ruined it all because I finished feeling ripped off. Very frustrating when you are paying 40 for an entree.The garlic naan was excellent, as was the chocolate dessert. The only problem is that I spent the rest of the meal dwelling on the stingy portion of goat meat. I rate expensive NYC restaurants based on relative value.

Let me say this I was disappointed. Food tasted very nice - no questions in it. but had I have this kind of food before? Yes absolutely. In every corner of US, 5 out of 10 restaurants do make this kind of food and I have had better Indian food with some classy and mid-expensive restaurants. Also, when we were there they discontinued serving couple of their signature dishes, like cauliflower tree, in their main course. So food was not the extraordinary factor here. Let's talk about service. first of all the lady over the phone was not polite at all. When we called to Junoon for reservation, I don't know in what hurry she was to finish the call. and when we arrived, she was throwing  ""why are you late, you wont get table now (Even after reservation)"" tantrums and not welcoming at all. But, finally we made it to the table (yes, big achievement). Waiters over there were also in hurry to make us finish our lunch. After coming to the table the plates you see had black spots which are generally wear and tear of utensils, cutlery etc. This is my main concern. If you're using any kind of plates, make sure it's neat and clean without any spots or signs of left over food in it. We ordered Hariyali Kofta, Nadru matar makhana and Dal makhani. Neither of them were served with rice or roti as mentioned in other reviews and after seeing pics from the yelp reviews, I saw that they were having green leafy portion on top of hariyali kofta, which we didn't have. we just had green curry and 4 koftas in it.

I think it's worth coming for the food but I recommend going with a party of 2-4 and checking out their menu for minimums, if any anymore.",2,1,0,Sonia A.,"Larchmont, NY",39,95,22

The first day was good when we were greeted by this guy who was very sweet and respectful and to be honest I left with a 4 star review in my mind for the restaurant.Then comes Day2 a guy came to take our order we started the order by saying ""We will have one lunch 3 course meal...."" and before we could finish he in a very rude tone interrupted us and said ""You cannot share the 3 course lunch meal"" to which I replied that we are going to order additional entrees for the both of us and we did (to be honest his whole response came across very I don't think you can afford to eat at this restaurant) after that when the food arrived he kept staring at us many times making us feel very uncomfortable I'm not sure if he wanted to check if we were sharing the food or not.Once we were done with the lunch when we asked for the check he just brought it and kept it on the table when I said ""thank you"" he just walked away.Most of the staff is pretty polite but the behavior of this one person completely ruined our experience.

Firstly it's New York summer and the AC in the restaurant was bust. They should not have taken reservations in this case, but they did and only when we reached did we realize the place was a furnace. They further lied and said the dining area was fine, but the AC was bust their too. The waiters were all stubborn and grumpy and very impatient to the point rude. The bathrooms are enormous and had wet floors, without any sign cautioning. I had a very bad fall in the bathroom, when I asked for ice, they only conceded when I asked to speak to the manager. The manager was extremely condescending and he kept interrupting me to ask me if I needed an ambulance.

The wait staff were polite and the service was efficient despite the chaos of a large bunch of guests who were constantly leaving their seats during a sit down meal to connect with other guests! Service was initially a little slow but they quickly picked up the pace when we asked them to. I will also note that Junoon seems to have bounced back from the abysmal service that a lot of yelpers have complained about (something we experienced ourselves when we went to dinner several months ago). I do wish they would update their upholstery though - some of the chairs have very concerning stains on them, unbecoming of the otherwise nice decor.

This is the only review I have ever written in over 40 years of eating out and I have joined Yelp especially to write it as a warning. My lunch there ( a cauliflower starter and a lamb main course) was mediocre, uninspired and downright bad. The cauliflower tasted stale and stogy. The lamb had no nuance and tasted as if it had come out of a packet. The room was so cold that although I had paid for it I could not even stay to eat my kulfi. Be warned not only is this place expensive you could do much better for a third of the price by going to Curry Hill. And it will make you very angry.

Totally understandable. As my friend and I waited, we checked out the lounge which appeared to be less crowded and I approached the hostess to let her know we were flexible and would take a table in there.  She told me that although it looked empty, the tables had incoming reservations.  Fast forward, 8:10 and we are still not sat yet......The hostess approaches me and informs me we can sit in the lounge. Annoyed and hungry, we took the table for two in the lounge.  Is it acceptable to be sat 1 hour after your reservation time? What REALLY annoyed me though was that she cancelled my Open Table reservation in the dining room and I didn't get my 100 points!!! GRRRRRRRRRRLet's skip to the service: No one could care less we had waited almost an hour to be sat.  No apologies, no ""Can I offer you a complementary......"" NOTHINGThe food & drinks: We ordered from the restaurant week menu. The eggplant appetizer was okay as was the shrimp, my friend got the lamp. Really heavy on the spices.  I'm marrying a middle easterner and I am used to such spices but wow! These dishes were soooo spicy!!!!The drinks were just okay as well.  I should have stuck with the punch, as my gin and tonic was really bad.

The kids went into the dining room before us and listened to the presentaiton that was being made to the staff. They were being told that this was the most important night of the year and they must be perfect.They were perfect.We had two waiters take care of our table for eight. I think that we were at the early seating and so there was extra staff to help. This was an amazing accident. Even though we were with teenagers, we were treated like royalty.We got the tasting menu which we highly recommend. The flavors of each course were amazing.

The entres were good too and different from your typical Indian restaurant. It seemed healthier - for example the malai kofta dish was served with spinach base instead of a cream base. All of the dishes seemed to use a different concoction of spices as well whereas in a lot of other Indian restaurants, some of the dishes seem to taste the same because they use the same masalas. The dal makhani and yellow dal were so so good! However, the rest of the entres (we had all 4 of the vegetarian entres) seemed to be overpriced for what they were.

The main course was really badly cooked- the coconut gravy in one of the dishes tasted and smelled stale. Our waiter took it back to the chef and a manager came back to apologize saying that the cook has prepared the gravy in the morning and we were being served that dish at 7.30pm! They offered a replacement, but we refused. Another curry had way too much salt in it and the third one was just average. Service was par for the course at any upscale NYC restaurant.

For drinks we got The east india gin and tonic which wasn't anything remarkable, and the Mumbai margarita which was a pleasant surprise with its mildly spicy notes. For the food - All of it was very good except for the garlic naan which I felt was just a naan you can find in frozen section at a store laden with butter - flat and buttery. The Chicken Lababdhar was mild but flavorful, it was great to eat with the naan... I could eat the gravy by it self it was so good. The Lamb chops were also delicious. The meat was tender not challenging and each bite was packed with flavor.  I tried justifying the price I paid for this meal but I just can't say it was worth it. The ambience was great, food was good but that being said the service was OK. Nothing worth writing home about. We were running out of naan and we had to call our waiter over and had to pause our meal in between while we waited for the naan to come out.

5.0,5/30/2016,"As a Michelin Star restaurant you'll have high expectations right? Wait for it, I'll get there...Their large entrance/waiting area has a lot of rich dark wood along the walls that give it a elegant look with comfy white couches. I hung out in this area for a few mins before our group of 8 started to arrive. A friend and I made our way to the bar area for drinks as we waited  until our group started to stroll in; this is not a spot out of Sex and the City where you'll find Mr. Big ladies. The bartenders are easy on the eyes though, and you will find the bar area to the left of the entrance. Their bar area is completely separate from their dining area, FYI.  As most of our group came in we made our way to be seated for dinner. I was a little taken back by the appearance of their dining area; it wasn't modern like their bar area. It looked like a huge banquet hall. I was expecting more of a modern appearance for a Michelin star restaurant. Their plates and silverware weren't fancy by any means; but then again I really didn't come for fancy plates and decor. I came to eat authentic Indian food with good company.Anytime a restaurant has to deal with a group can be tough. Junoon handled our group courteously and pretty quickly. Once we were seated our waiter came over promptly and discussed the menu with us. We didn't go with the tasting menu and they were accommodating in allowing us to pick multiple appetizers to share and pick our own entrees. Our appetizers came out shortly after we placed our order. They left just enough time to finish our appetizers when our entrees started to appear. Our wine glasses were refilled in a very timely matter; wine refilling with your dinner may be important to some people and if that's you reading this review you're in luck. Now on to the food, some things you may want try:Noorani Kebabl, Eggplant Chaat, Bagarey Baigan, Kerala Shrimp Curry, Lamb Kolhapuri, Paneer Aur Mirchi Ka Salan and Tandoor Roasted Poussin just to name a few.I really enjoyed their eggplant,  mushroom curry, lamb and chicken dishes; all truly left an impact on my tastebuds for days. Anyone I came in contact with about food left an opening for me to rant for 5-10mins about the food and how I couldn't wait to return. So should you have Michelin Star expectations? Yes, you should!

The ambience is great as well. Where the restaurant fails is service- every server we have had here has been very rude, insensitive and frankly abrasive. They are neither accommodating nor friendly. It's amazing how great the people are at dinner- friendly, helpful and conversational.I don't want to take anything away from the food. However in recent months the lunch specials have gotten a) smaller in their portion size b) more expensive ($25 to $30), c) limited in their variety (no lamb, no thali). It's probably less value for money than it's ever been, but it's still a good kitchen.

Generally I love coconut-based curries and this one was made especially well. I wish I had more stomach room to try everything else on their menu! Service was quick and professional.

You can choose your meal in the Patiala Room or go for pre-fix in the dining room. We decided to go for the pre-fix. The menu took a while to understand. A 6 course meal had no options, so we went for the 3 course where you can choose! We tried beet papdi and paneer appetizers. Both were yummy. Paneer was very soft like it had been steamed. It seemed a tad bland compared to the beet, but was soft and good to eat. For main my husband got chicken while I got lotus root, which was tasty. Breads were yummy, an assortment of paratha and naan. For dessert we had kulfi and chocolate. Dessert was very underwhelming. Disappointing. Turmeric ice cream with dark chocolate didn't work. Kulfi flavors were also not that great, I have had creamier and more tasty kulfi elsewhere. After a tasty meal I expected better dessert!The pomegranate mango juice was yummy, I don't get why the glass was only half full! Way to skimp. Overall it was a different meal, tasty, pricey.

She said that there is no seat available now, you all need to wait till 11pm. She added that we can arrange for a table which has fixed menu which costs $58 plus tax per person which is a bit too much. We were really pissed of by this bad customer service because at that moment we saw inside a few empty spaces and also a few customers finished their dinner and were coming out of the restaurants. This means there were enough space to accomodate just 3 of us but purposely we were asked to wait the next 45 minutes or given an option to go for a high priced fixed menu! We were hungry and already late so definitely we came out of the restaurant and went in to a neighbouring restuarant called Almond which has very good customer service and great food even at 10.30pm at night.

The chef used a medley of different kinds of mushrooms, so it made to be a memorable dish. The same went for the eggplant dish. The tomato ginger sauce is extremely flavorful and elevated the simple eggplant. I also ordered a Mumbai margarita and it was deliiiicious! What an incredibly tasty meal.

In this trip to NY I finally made it to Junoon, only to get average quality food and sub standard service. My friend and I went for the lunch, and opted for the three course lunch. The egg plant starter was good, the mirchi pakoras were neither crispy not well made. The main course was eggplant and koftas, both were decent, but nothing out of the world. For the breads the waiter messed up our order, and the naans were not well made and a little cold in fact. The desserts were phirni and rabri. I had high hopes for phirni, it was again okay, but nothing extra ordinary. I really did not understand what the hype is about this place. The food is slightly better than the average neighborhood Indian restaurant, but it does not qualify as Michelin.Having been to other Michelin places, the service was pretty sub standard.

But in reality the food was pretty tasty, the prices not exorbitant, and the service pretty decent. Now on to the review...We actually made reservations for the Patiala room because of the ""business casual"" dress code in their main dining room. Not sure if this made a difference though because in reality the Patiala room was quite nice.If we had one  overall complaint it would be regarding their cocktails- just sweet and not so good. The sweetness complimented the spiciness of the food somewhat, but on their own a clear miss.Now the food: we almost did the multi-course ""tasting"" because the menu is so extensive, but ultimately we opted to select our own dishes because it turned out to be cheaper and we could get exactly what each of us wanted.First the great: lamb boti kebab, piri piri shrimp, eggplant main dish, goat curry- all hitsThe good: bhut jolokia murgh tikka, murgh lambador- good but not greatMisses: root vegetable masala, chicken breast dumplingWe thought the rice, naan, and chutneys were all very well done.

This attentiveness seems to be shared by all his staff. One of the other qualities that stood out to me was how polite the entire staff was, from Chef Vikas to the hosts to the service staff, everyone was extremely polite and seemed concerned about assuring that we had a great experience.

Yesterday was my first time here and I am usually very divided when it comes to ""classy"" Indian restaurants because typically what most high-end restaurants lack in food they do try to make up in class. However, Junoon was a very pleasant surprise. We ordered the chef's favorite Murgh Tikka Mirza Hasnu & Paneer Kasturi as our appetizers and the former was out of this world while the latter was mild but delicious. For the main course we ordered the Mushroom Curry & the Hara Paneer Kofta and both lived up to the high-standards already set. The one star I am taking away here is because of the disappointing desert options they had. We tried the Kulfi -  which came in three variants & the Saffron phirni, both were very different from what I was actually expecting. One important thing to mention here is that no masalas(spices) were overcooked. Even while we were tasting the food, every ingredient stood out.

This was a prefix lunch experience.Ambience 4/10. Not as intimate. No flowers/ candles on the tables. No traditional music. The tables and chairs are plain. Cutlery very basic.Service 8/10. Courteous staff. Quick and clean service.Food - overall 7/10. The starter we got was bhoot jholakiya murgh tikka. Outstanding!! Excellent marination. Delicious combination of papaya and coriander mint chutney. Brilliance in the plate. In itself this dish is 9/10. Entree I got murgh tikka masala- very ordinary 4/10. The curry was not well blended in spices. Marination for the chicken was lacking the hit. I could taste the bland chicken pm the inside. My hubby got hara bhara paneer kofta. Pieces of kofta in spinach sauce topped with crisp kale- what a brilliant combination. I have not tasted better koftas in nyc. Perfect!! Crisp on the outside and absolutely soft on the inside. Curry was very well done. Not oily. Spices balanced. The kale on the top is a winner! I would rate this dish 9/10. We concluded with dessert. I got the falooda. Very disappointed. Guava went very well but the mango icecream and jelly with whipped cream killed it! Mango icecream was too tarty and jelly with whipped cream kill the authenticity of falooda. It would be so much better to have cashew or butterscotch icecream instead. Falooda was not even a 2/10 in flavor. My hubby's saffron firnee sweet dish was absolutely outstanding. The taste of saffron stayed on our palate and we so loved it. Not too sweet- just right! I would rate this one 7/10.Overall experience- 6/10. Will I come here again? No. Is it the best place to eat indian in NYC? No. Michelin star justified? Not honestly. Was expecting more!

When we saw the chicken first, we thought it would be bland. But when we took the first bite, there was an explosion of flavors and spice in the mouth. For those who have a high tolerance for spice should definitely try it out. The entree dishes and the desserts were amazing too. We had the Kerala shrimp curry and chicken kofta.

I had the salmon, lamb and kolfi. My friend had chicken, lamb and the other desert choice. According to my colleague it's Indian fusion and the dishes I had were good. Two things I do have to mention is that the server didn't explain any of the dishes that were provided, not a big deal but the same server then later took the time to explain the desert but none of the prior dishes.Another staff brought us the wine (we had two course wine pairing) and he literally introduced the wine with ""this is Chardonnay and pairs very well"", pours me a taste (with his hands shaking) and then a glass. My second glass he introduced it similarly by mumbling off the vineyard (i think) and how it pairs very well. While he was pouring I noticed it's a cotes du rhone which I mentioned out loud, I don't believe he was being lazy but maybe just lack of knowledge? He very well could've mentioned it's French, from rhone valley and grenache based or just memorize a few words from the label. It's slightly embarrassing for a fine dining restaurant to have staffs serves wine and not take the initiative to maybe read the label beforehand and pretend you know what you are taking about. Didn't really matter to me ultimately but I found that to be embarrassing.

4.0,2/2/2016,"Think enough has been said already. It is a Michelin star restaurant so you've got to be thick to have not enjoyed the experience (if not the food itself). Didn't find the service as friendly as I'd expect it to be in a Michelin star restaurant but that's okay because it wasn't bad either. I wish they'd relax with the constant refilling of my glass of water though. They get one star less for the average service and the fact that a lot of the food is not really Indian-Indian traditionally speaking. Its experimental in nature. Marvelously successful experiments, no doubt, but my problem is semantic (that its called Indian food) and therefore pedantic in nature. Definitely recommend to everyone reading this. Of course, its expensive but that shouldn't be a surprise. The food and experience is truly exceptional and worth every penny.",0,0,0,Sukumar P.,"New York, NY",0,6,0
4.0,2/1/2016,"I have never been to a Michelin-starred restaurant, but this place set the bar high. I haven't been to many Indian restaurants, but this place was AHHMAZING! It is around Union Square area and not in the most populated street but those are the best places where things can be missed. This place however is not one of them. The restaurant's decor was very intimate and had three different areas of seating which is in different rooms unlike other restaurants and seemed to have all different feels to it as well. The ambiance of the place spoke for itself, dim lighting, some traditional decor but very classy and modern. I came here for restaurant week of course and for dinner and had the mirchi pakora as a starter which was shishito pepper which was paired with mint, a tamarind chutney and whipped paneer. Once it was served you can smell how fragrant the shishito pepper was and when you dip into each individual sauce they all brought different flavors to your pallet. One was on the sweet more tangy side, another was refreshing and last one was a great balance between each of them. For the entree they came with either naan or basmati rice. I chose the naan and didn't expect much from it but the naan was great, it had a garlic seasoning to it and came out warm and fresh from the kitchen. Now for the entree I had Andhra Gosht which it says braised goat on the website for the menu but I remember saying it was braised lamb. Either way it was full of flavor! I was really in love with this dish because the meat was actual dense pieces of meat with no fat on it and you really didn't need more than the couple of pieces they gave you. You can taste every part of the seasoning in both the curry like substance it came with and the meat. But I am a sucker for dessert and the dessert blew my mind away! There were so many different levels of flavor that you can taste from the guava, to the bits of passionfruit and the whipped peppercorn foam was to die for. The dessert was both light and tasted as if you ate a rose from a botanical garden if that was what roses would taste like. There was also something interesting in the middle where it was like a green ice cream but without the milk I believe thats what he said, however it was apparently pistachio flavored. I couldn't figure out what it was until one of the workers said it because it was something everyone had but wouldn't expect. The dessert also had vermicelli noodles that were crunchy and added a bit of texture in the dessert from the rest of the smoother textured contents.  Everything about this restaurant was worth the trip and the money. They had great customer service, refolding the napkins when we got up, gave up warm towels that were soaked in something amazing because made my hand feel all supple afterwards, and they always refilled your waters and even the manager stopped by to see how we were doing and took our plates away. I love seeing managers do that because it shows even from a higher status at the restaurant he's never too good to take plates away and goes the extra mile for the customer. It is worth every penny coming here and whomever is touring around restaurant week, come here it is worth the visit! The food is sophisticated and took all the simple ingrediants and elevated them in a way you have to go back for seconds.",2,1,1,Jennifer C.,"New York, NY",162,24,20

4.0,1/31/2016,"Junoon was on my wishlist for a long time. It is a rather expensive place, but thanks to NYC Restaurant week, we were able to dine here.The ambiance is warm, welcoming and has a blend of modern and indian architecture.We went for the prix fixe lunch and at $ 25, it was a gourmet delight AND a steal. For the appetizer, we had Mirchi Pakodas and eggplant chaat. I would definitely recommend the eggplant chaat for its creative use of crispy eggplant slices as the base and yogurt and tamarind to give a flavorful chaat experience.For the main course, I had the eggplant khatte meethe and my friends had the Paneer Mirchi ka Salan. The eggplant khatte meethe was delectable, with sweet and sour flavors, balanced by the eggplant and naan. The Paneer mirchi ka Salan was comprised of cottage cheese cubes with a peanut tamarind sauce. The curry had the hotness of green peppers to it and the coarseness of ground peanuts. I'll say I preferred the eggplant over the paneer. The dessert was the most anticipated course for me. The saffron phirni was delicious and just the right amount of sweet. The mango cream was a pleasant surprise for my taste buds, as was the crunch of the sesame crisps and candied almonds. The falooda was delicious as well with a guava flavor that was not too strong and topped with a dollop of whipped cream.Junoon was all about the flavors, I've never quite had an Indian meal like this: sugar, spice and everything nice.

I felt totally satisfied, five stars!Tonight, I had the polar opposite experience when I brought my parents to enjoy Junoon. We were seated next to the bar at 8:00, could barely hear each other, and proceeded to get the cold shoulder all night. We waited well over two hours for our main courses to arrive with barely a glance, and when they finally did, they came out piecemeal - three entrees arrived, with no rice or sides, and the rest materialized ten minutes later, just in time for the original entrees to become cold and congealed.

We split everything family style and I remember the cauliflower dish I ordered being a big hit.A big (and weird) drawback was the bathroom downstairs, as others have commented on. The lower level area is very cavernous and you're greeted by a cool spice room. When my friend emerged, she gave me a polite warning that still could not have prepared us.

Ambience: okay I'll give it to you guys, this is fine diningish place, and the ambience is apt. But I did feel like the place was slightly intimidating and it made me self conscious. eating out isn't supposed to make you feel like that, right? One may argue that any fine dining place would make one feel like that (small, less significant, etc). But I will argue that it doesn't. 2. Service: I was not impressed. There was one 'main server' (a lady) for our entire section of some 8 tables. There were other servers but they were clearly a helping hand. We were really hungry when we came in, and got into the food order immediately. For two people, we got an appetizer, an entree, 2 types of breads, rice and yogurt. The server insisted on us getting another entree (we dint, because we know how much humans are capacitated to eat). We then waited another 15 minutes before reminding one of the servers that we were waiting to place our drinks order. Not the fault of the server, cause the place was filling up. But who's fault is it after all? 3. I will give them a +1 on the drink (whiskey 27). although I do wish I got a little more..? I feel petty even writing this, but it was a really small drink. 4. Food: the food was good, there's no disputing that. But was it the best Indian food I had ever had? No. NO. Was it a unique eating experience. NO. Was anything about the food exclusive? No. It was plain, average, vanilla. 5. Prices: it is pricey, and hence, by the end of the experience, you're just left with a confused state of mind.",5,2,0,Rohit K.,"New York, NY",99,26,8

Not a lot, and you'd be right to disregard my view on them.When it comes to Indian food though, I'm on surer ground, we were raised on this cuisine.Ok, so here's why I have junoon at 3 and not 5 stars.Dining room:Didn't work for me, in a city where space is at a premium, this felt like it had too much (I commented to my wife it felt like a hotel restaurant in Dubai where warehouse levels of space are a given)However, on our way out I noticed the front section with bar which looked FAR more cosy and I'd eat in that area if I returned.Food:Look, it was good - I'm not going to knock your food junoon just because it's a slightly different take on the Indian diaspora culinary culture than the uk. The paneer cheese dish was notably good (paneer mirchi ka salan).The weakest dish was my starter (lahsooni gobi) which (to me) tasted more Italian with its tomato sauce than indian.Indian fine dining needs to offer something spectacularly different (I'm as equally as critical of Benares in Mayfair, London) to truly stand out with the honest, skilful and genuine Indian food and flavours on offer for a whole lot less cash in a less self conscious environment.",11,4,3,John B.,"London, United Kingdom",215,380,1342

It seems like there's a real difference between the food and service at the bar versus the restaurant. (Tip- Go with the restaurant!) Also I feel like overall the very traditional Indian dishes are not very special here (given their large price tag) and the secret is to really stuck with only the unique items on the menu.A few notes of drift the things to stay away from:1. The Chutney Sampler - Embarrassingly terrible. Just don't waste your time or money on this. It's disgusting and boring. 2. The Desserts - Sorry, they're just not good and don't let anyone try to tell you different. 3. I'm questioning the Lobster slightly. It was really good, but you tend to taste it specifically for hours afterwards. Not a good sign...4. Skip the lentil dishes and the byranis. Good and all but severely overpriced considering how dull they are. It feels like a waste and if you get too many of these types of dishes you'll wonder why the hell you came here to begin with.Definitely order:1. THE DRINKS! The cocktail menu is incredible.

This place is doing Indian at a whole other level with thoughtful care give to everything from the gracious service, the downright sexy ambiance, and especially their creative approach to Indian cooking. There's no masala-out-of a bag going on here. They are clearly making their own spice blends and applying them with expertise to their creative dishes. While you'll find some old faithfuls on the menu, like say yellow daal, even those taste like a whole new experience. The crispy cauliflower was wonderful with a tangy and spicy tomato sauce. The naan and daal were perfection, and the sea bass was nothing short of rapturous. The sauce on the sea bass had us rolling our eyes in delight. I also loved that they did not dumb down the spice levels. Indian food should be spicy, and this was without anyone asking me for a ""star rating."" Instead it comes the way it should be done. While I'm sure they would accommodate someone wanting less spice, I like that it starts with a default of what is correct for the dishes.

2.0,10/26/2015,"This was my third visit to Junoon in the last couple of years. At each consecutive visit, my experience has been worse than the previous one, but this one was extraordinarily bad. I made a reservation for five people, including a friend and his parents. The latter were visiting from India, and I wanted to take them to a fine dining Indian restaurant in New York City. I was embarrassed after the dinner since I have had far better dinner experiences in less fancier Indian restaurants, both in the States and back in India, and so have the visitors.After a few appetizers, we ordered a couple of vegetarian dishes, two non-vegetarian entrees, a vegetable biryani and a goat biryani. A paneer dish we ordered was good, and so was a chicken kofta dish. The biryanis, however, were very ordinary -- I get better biryani at India Square in Jersey City for a far cheaper price, that too delivered to my home. The lamb boti kebab was good, but I have had much better kebab in the city.What made a real difference was the service -- it was deplorable. There was a time when our waiter left our table for another table *while* taking our dessert order, and was basically not coming back until we called him over. Later, we had ordered the desserts, and when he repeated it, we realized that he noted down completely wrong items. We had to repeat ourselves twice before he got our dessert order right. The waiter who initially took our appetizer and entree orders was extremely rude, and did not explain details of any item that they served. He did not even thank the guests after the check was paid. Having been to many restaurants that are usually listed alongside Junoon in various fine dining lists, I found this unusual. Some of the food was left over after dinner, and we asked to take it home to not waste it. However, when the check was paid and we left, we realized that they had completely forgotten about it.I am not sure if this is a rare occasion of supremely bad service, but if this continues, Junoon will be the next Indian restaurant in New York to lose its sole Michelin star.",2,0,0,Dipanjan D.,"Jersey City, NJ",1,21,3

Believe me it would be our last.We then had to wait for 15 minutes for someone to take our order. The 3 appetizers we ordered were all average. The concept of the chicken seekh stuffed in lamb was unique, but was overpowered by the taste of cloves. We ordered 3 entrees and a biryani. They got us the wrong order and left that in the table for free. We felt as if we were at any other roadside shack with the taste of the food. Absolutely under whelming.

Service was very attentive but not so much that I felt like the waiters were hovering around the table. Food was good, but not great. That sounds vague but what I'm getting at is that this food is not any better than what you can get at other Indian restaurants around the city for cheaper prices. What you're really paying for is the ambiance.The one standout dish is the cauliflower appetizer which must be made with some secret ingredient as I can never replicate it at home.

I would lick the plate if I could (but it would've been inappropriate considering the type of restaurant it is).. the naans (junoon special and garlic) MELT in your mouth.. I'm still to eat naans better than the ones they have. Hare paneer k kofte were a pleasant  (and yummy) change from the typical tikka masala/kofta/kadhai available at every Indian restaurant. The staff is very friendly and efficient. PLUS I got  a picture with chef vikas khanna  (who was also very warm)..

4.0,9/6/2015,"Junoon has some really good Indian food. I went with a friend who is vegetarian and we decided to share food so I didn't taste any meat. We started off with the Cauliflower appetizer, it was garlicky, tomatoey and spicy, it was good. We had the paneer ka salan and the yellow dal for mains along with the Junoon special naan, missi roti (chickpea roti) and the regular roti. The dish that really stood out for me was the Paneer ka Salan, it had great balance and made me overeat. The Junoon special naan was really good but also very heavy. We also tried the kulfi for dessert, I was not a big fan of the Paan flavor but the mango and cardamom were nice. We just had some beer and didn't try any of their really fancy sounding cocktails. I would recommend this place to anyone wanting to try modern Indian food. The service was also spot on. I will be back to try their meat and cocktails.",1,0,1,Ashish D.,"Manhattan, NY",57,195,254

5.0,9/5/2015,"45 seconds. That is the amount of time it took for the waiter to observe, swoop in and fold a napkin that was left on a diner's departed chair.Such exacting discipline is reflected not just in the service at Junoon but also the delivery and execution of eatables. It's the perfect fusion of Auguste Escoffier and a nawab's palace that makes for a most memorable dining experience.As my appetites turn east to India, I've explored and relished many a buffet and restaurant. I've eaten off styrofoam plates, tried many a kebab and know the differences between keema, kulfi and kheer. So when it was time for my birthday dinner I knew the flavors in demand and needed the appropriate ambiance.Junoon is vast and spacious, allowing you a private dining like experience amidst plenty of other appropriately spaced tables. The wait staff did not miss a beat, from explaining the menu to replacing our plates and cutlery, their hawk like efficiency was most appreciated.As was every item I ate last night, starting with two appetizers: piri piri shrimp and murgh tikka mirza hasnu. I was pleasantly surprised that for a Michelin star rated restaurant of this caliber that the portions were not microscopic but rather visible to the naked eye.The murgh stands out thanks to the succulent tandoori chicken thigh. Each menu item contains a list of ingredients and while there is intellectual satisfaction in knowing exactly what one eats, the exact moment of first contact with the murgh makes one cast aside all pretenses of knowledge. Stop thinking, start eating and enjoy this feast of the senses.My main course was patiala shahi goat and once again I was not disappointed. Served with junoon spiced naan (zaatar, paneer, gruyere) the quality of the goat meet vastly exceeded the minuscule portions of flesh I've had elsewhere. Here was an abundance of goat and not just bone as I've had at other places.The naan was by far one of the best naan I have eaten due to the fusion of flavors you find with paneer and gruyere. Hardly any grease or excess oil was found in any of the dishes, another mark of distinction from the typical Indian spot.My coconut rice pudding dessert elevated kheer to another level by including bruleed bananas, rum glaze and ginger ice cream. Mixing the flavors together produced something otherworldly without being crass.The cocktail that I nursed while feasting was called the Ghazal and the word appropriately describes my feelings of loss of having had to depart from two hours of pure pleasure.For that period of time I felt like a moghul emperor, a 21st century Akbar (not the admiral but the original) and Junoon was my private dining lair.",12,5,7,Tom K.,"Forest Hills, NY",337,820,47
4.0,8/29/2015,"Went here during Restaurant Week a while back. The ambience is incredible; super upscale, super formal, super classy. During my visit, the service certainly reflected the environment - totally cool and classy. But ambience isn't everything.The food was delicious. I had Lahsooni Gobi, Paneer Aur Mirch Ka Salan, and the Passion Fruit Mousse. I think the thing that made the food delicious were the sauces - I could tell that every single sauce that was used was well though-out, tried and tested, flavorful, perfectly balanced, etc.The portions, though, were ridiculously small.  Quality is important, but that doesn't mean that one can just toss ""quantity"" out the window, as Junoon seems to have done. It was clear to me only after my visit to Junoon that I paid for the ambience and not for the food. While I enjoyed my meal, I feel like I could've gotten a comparable meal elsewhere in the city for $10-20 cheaper. And this was the restaurant week tasting menu - I shudder to think how much people are paying here normally. It's good Indian food, but I've certainly had good Indian food elsewhere in the city for far cheaper.

We weren't really able to do the Restaurant Week menu as there just wasn't enough choice for vegetarians (we like to get different dishes and share and there weren't enough of these that were vegetarian to do that). But, the regular menu had plenty of choices. Even though it's an upscale place, the prices were moderate; I spend as much at divey Indian restaurants as I did here. The raita was amazing; it seems like a simple thing to make, but so many Indian places don't seem to be able to create a refreshing raita so we really appreciated this. Another stand out was the Lahsooni Gobi. The Nadru Kofte was great, but I wish there were more than four tiny dumplings (it is an entrée so I was expecting six or seven).

3.0,8/19/2015,"Oh Vikas Khanna, I've been wanting to try your restaurant for a long time now.  I'm always tempted to come in during Restaurant Week but then I ask myself, should I really spend that much money on regular indian food (with fancy names) with a smaller quantity?  Luckily, I was able to finally go this past week for a group lunch with colleagues.  When you hear Vikas Khanna and see him on Master Chef and the type of discipline he has in place for his students, as a customer I have an expectation that the food and service will be equivalent to that level of discipline and something more distinguished.  A few of us chose the $25 3 course menu and others chose the $25 thali menu.  For apps I ordered BHUT JOLOKIA MURGH TIKKA which was pretty much your malai kebab marinated in ghost pepper spice.  The spice level was manageable.  For the main course I ordered the MURGH LABABDAR which is just a fancy name for chicken tikka masala/butter chicken and that's exactly what it was.  For dessert I went with the PISTACHIO MOUSSE.  It was quite refreshing and probably the most distinguished part of the meal.I do have a gripe, the entree was cold.  I didn't like the serving style.  The  main entrees were brought out and we had to wait 2-3 minutes for the rice and naan to come to our table.  By then our entrees were cold.  This is the discipline I was referring to for this type of restaurant.  To me, the food should be hot.   However kudos to the style of serving the food in the thali; it was a cute crescent shape with the 8-9 dishes to fit in with your plate.Knowing Indian food and the expected price for this type of food, it was an average experience for me.  I felt like I paid for the name and ambiance more than for the food.  Did I enjoy it being it was my first time there?  Sure.  Would I come back again?  No.",2,0,1,Kanika B.,"Queens, NY",16,45,0

It seemed like nobody in the restaurant was having a good time. The waiter was a bit dismissive when he realized we would be ordering from the restaurant week menu. But the food was the worst part of the experience. We ordered 2 appetizers (eggplant and tandoori chicken), the chicken entree and both desserts. Neither of these really stood out in terms of flavor but the worst part of all was that the portions were TINY. For the chicken entree, we got 2 small chicken meatballs (!!!). It was so small that it was funny. We left feeling hungry and ripped off. We also had the wine pairing option and we were disappointed to note that the size of the wine pours was also diminutive (half a glass per course, which came up to 1.5 glasses for $25). The sommelier was very nice and took his time to explain each wine pairing. However, the waiter did not inform him on time, so he was late to pour our wines (we were halfway into our entree - i.e. already ate one of our two meatballs! - when he came to pour our wine pairing).

If you have a confused look on your face then you know my thoughts exactly. After being seated they gave us this complimentary sampler with a traditional Indian deep fried popped rice. It was stale from the moisture it observed from sitting out with the rest of the dishes elements. Foul taste to start the evening. Wait staff was excellent. Set up on silverware was not Michelin Star worthy but this is yelp and I'm not French.   The appetizers and main courses were delicious. They went cheap on the restaurant week menu by only providing eggplant for the vegetarians (no paneer) but I'm sure they are paying a fortune to the executive chefs that don't allow the extra cents on the ingredients. Be prepared to only receive two balls 1 inch in diameter of the murgh for the main. You'll need to order extra rice or naan to fill you. Or go elsewhere after supper.

I agree with some of the reviewers, every dish leaves something to be desired for.

What do they want to accomplish with these delays, I can't fathom. Anyway the indian specialty cocktail - Tandoori Gin was neither Tandoori nor spicy. The cocktail was just a plain old G+T. I went withg Lahsooni gobhi and MURGH TIKKA MIRZA HASNU as the first course given how many rave reviews have been for this dish. I dont think people have really had a good lahsooni gobhi. The absolutely best lahsooni gobhi is done in US in Darien and this version was more like a sauce covered rendering that is good but no greatness of Khanna here. The tandoori chicken though was moist and flavorful without the heat even though it has initial punch of spiciness. Really well done ! The TANDOORI BLACK LIME MURGH was also an eclectic mix of tandoori renderings of chicken. The goat curry was the perfection of a well done home cooked rich curry with tender goat pieces that did not overwhelm. Junoon deserves 5 Stars for its main course.

So here is why -Arrival - our reservation was for 4 people plus an infant at 9pm on a Friday night. We arrived around 8.45 and were asked to wait. Seated around 10 past nine with quite a few tables being empty in their main dining room, we were escorted to the lounge area. At no point anyone informed us we will be in lounge as we had an infant with us which didn't go down too well especially after waiting for long and paying Michelin star prices. Not cool!Service- our waitress was polite yet firm on certain things like not being flexible to alter the cocktail my friend wanted. I understand that but if your guest want it just do it as long as they are ok to alter the taste... Isn't service about pleasing your diners?Food- I would give top marks to the sunchoke kebab. The only dish that reflects real modern Indian cooking because if you actually review the entire menu, it is more traditional than modern to me except a few dishes. So I protest when they call themselves modern indian food, just call yourself indian food. Modern indian requires a lot of thought about fusing interesting ingredients with indian cooking and yes above all the way you present it. The main entrees are presented like a bowl of curry's to share which is how a traditional restaurant would do not modern outpost.... I am afraid!The paneer aur mirchi Ka salan entree dish was below average so order at your risk. Tasted more like malai paneer not the salan.Chicken and lamb kebabs were ok too.Lehsooni gobhi was ok not bad.Toilets - no baby changing area  so people with babies bring a chaperone !Somehow the overall experience didn't leave a wow factor and hefty prices only rubs salt at the wrong place!",5,3,0,Priyanka S.,"San Jose, CA",150,168,194

The ambiance is quiet but not stuffy.  One of us in the group didn't drink alcohol and Junoon had a nice selection of non-alcoholic beverages (mocktails)  that were both delicious and festive looking, so she was thrilled not being relegated to cola or iced tea.    Two in our group enjoy hot and spicy and two in our group prefer things  not spicy hot.  The problem is the waiter suggested spicy things that were bland, and ""not spicy"" things that set my mouth on fire.  We ended up trading dishes and got things we liked, but it shouldn't happen that way. Someone here on Yelp mentioned that the shrimp tasted like it was cooked in ketchup, and I agree with that statement. I came back on another night just for drinks at the bar.  The bar drinks are pricey, but what's most annoying is that the one I ordered had the glass totally filled with ice, so the actual drink was about 1/4 of the glass. They were $15. each and I could have easily had 4 - and I'm not a big drinker.   Also, there were no little free nibbles at the bar.  When you're charging that price for a drink, at least give me a full drink and some nuts or chips. I'd go back here if I was on an expense account, not on my own ""dime"".",0,0,0,CJ C.,"New York, NY",2,6,0

My first time in New York and couldn't help but go to one of the world famous desi restaurants and eat dal sabzi. The main course meal was amazing (simple light and to the point) and so were the cocktails. Try the Adraki punch sometime. It was suggested to me by my husband. He is a Junoon fan. Been there couple of times. We were little disappointed with the icy kulfi that we were served as we were expecting something milky and not just ice. As for the ambience, I am not sure if there was anything that established the desiness of the place except few seating. I am assuming in a bid to appeal to all sorts of nationalities, Junoon doesn't want to look all desi. Or if you feel otherwise do share.

I had the salmon Kabob which came with an onion relish. It was such a great combination. The salmon was tender, juicy, and flavorful while the acid from the relish brought it to the next level for me. I also tried the crispy cauliflower appetizer and the fingerling potato with beans entree. Both were spectacular, well seasoned and while the ingredients may have been simple, the dish was complex with depth of flavor and plenty of texture. Will most definitely come back to try more.

Came here to celebrate my mom and brother's birthday. Made reservations ahead of time and arrived on time. The restaurant was practically empty, but of course people poured in later. The atmosphere here is lovely. Appetizers:-Eggplant chaat was really good. Loved hour sour the tamarind was. -Piri Piri shrimp which tasted pretty ketchupy to me. The side salad was dressed really nicely though.Mains:-Wild striped bass Malvan. This was probably the best meat entree they had. The sauce could have used a squeeze of lemon.-Shahi lamb shank. So disappointing. It had no seasoning at ALL! SO boring and bland and of course, no garnish (cilantro, please). I was super disappointed by this, it was what I was looking forward to the most. -Jaipuri bhindi was so salty, almost inedible. The naan saved the day here. Flavor profile was pretty good, but still ugh too salty.Garlic naan good but you could tell it wasn't made in a tandoori oven. The paratha had a nice texture.

I LOVE LOVE LOVE the Jaipuri Bhindi cooked with sour mango (I'm aware it's strange to profess one's adoration for fried okra so passionately, but this might be the one for me).2. I also like the Patiala Shahi Goat, the Junoon Spice naan and the Laccha paratha an appropriate amount.  Try the Ghost Chilli Murgh Tikka at your own risk - the chicken is wonderfully tender, but it is frightfully spicy.3. The much-anticipated goat biryani and the baigarey baigan left a lot to be desired.  And the Lahsooni Gobhi was a huge disappointment for me.  4. Desserts can definitely be skipped here.  5. On my first visit here, I'd asked if I could get an alcoholic Mango Lassi (asked for mine with rum) and the bartender not only obliged, but was apparently very excited about this awesome idea.  In case you fail to appreciate the obvious genius of this idea, order the Mumbai Margarita; it's pretty good, too.",4,2,2,Ceres R.,"New York, NY",5,44,45

The staff was rude and didnot greet us. They then offered us a bad seating area - totally unsuitable for a family. On refusing to sit there - they  tried to get us into sitting in an even worse area. Worse - they didnot have a high chair(which the lady did not tell me when i made the appointment) & they asked me to bring a stroller. We just walked out & ended up getting pizza home.

You could get better tasting food and better service in any Indian restaurant in a Midwestern town. You could get better food in curry hill or in queens. I ordered junoons version of the chicken tikka masala (murgh Labadar) and it was pieces of bland tasting chicken in a flavored puréed tomato. Flavor was absent and so was the depth. Rice pulao was just plain basmati rice and my Eastern European waitress had absolutely no clue about the menu or what to recommend.

Lots of vegetarian options--they even have a veg tasting menu. I started with crispy fried eggplant chaat in a tamarind sauce and raita then had the lotus root dumpling kofta with paneer cheese in a tomato fenugreek cream sauce which was scrumptious, luscious and decadent. Gotta get the Junoon Spice Naan--it has Gruyere! What? Not exactly traditional, but off the hook. Gracious service, knowledgable sommelier. It's not cheap.

5.0,3/15/2015,"This would be a great place to bring a date. It smells great from the minute you walk through the door. It's a very large restaurant, and very spacious by NYC standards. The decor is modern, with nice Indian-style arches between the rooms. We came here for a birthday celebration, and everyone had a good time. We started with some of their fancy cocktails. They had a punch that came in an attractive copper cup, and I enjoyed a ""27 West,"" which had whiskey and ginger liqueur in it. Before the food came, they brought a little ""amuse bouche"" for us, like all fancy restaurants should: it was a coconut soup with roasted coconuts and coconut granola on top. It was hot, and cold, and crunchy, and coconutty, and we all enjoyed it.The dishes are intended for sharing, and that's what we did. We took our waitress' appetizer recommendation, which were deep-fried cauliflower fritters, and gobbled those down. Then came our entrees of 2 lamb dishes, brussels sprouts and peas (together) that were really delicious, lotus root dumplings (also really good), red snapper in green curry, some kabobs with ground chicken & lamb, and a lentil dal. Oh, and of course bread. We opted for 2 kinds of naan, the spiced and the garlic. Yum.Since it was a birthday, we had to have dessert. They were out of chocolate cake(!), so we opted for the ""stout date cake,"" which was very dense and was served with homemade ice cream and candied orange peels. At the end, they surprised us with one more little treat, tiny chocolates and mango jellies. We liked it all, the decor, the service, the menu, it was all good.

Our bartenders were very sweet and attentive despite the fact that they were super busy. We had very good martinis - they also have quite an array of innovative cocktails featuring syrups they make in-house.All of the food was very good. Stand-outs were the cauliflower appetizer and the crispy okra entree.

The way 4 waiters came and in total coordination placed the food on the table was awesome.I put some pics of my dishes, I will say it was over priced based off of food, but as a total package I wouldn't mind coming here again. The food was flavorful but it didn't hit the spot.

We ordered a lamb dish, eggplant dish, cauliflower dish, two naan breads. One regular and one that is stuffed with potatoes. I was a little Leary of the eggplant dish but admit it was really good. Eggplant chips almost like potatoes. The cauliflower was delicious and some of the best I ever had. My lamb was the kebab loin and was really quite good. I ordered the punch drink that had vodka in it. It came in a mule brass mug with candied ginger on top. Quite good. We were so full already we didn't order any more food and went for dessert. We ordered the Kalfi sampler and then the chocolate cake. The Kalfi sampler was interesting.the mango was very good. The cardamom was good and then the last was made from a leaf that helps digestion very well known in India. It was interesting to try but not my cup of tea. The chocolate cake was excellent in presentation but it didn't taste as nice as it appeared. Oh well chocolate cake usually just doesn't come out that well executed at Indian restaurants.

3.0,3/6/2015,"So my family and I have super high standards when it comes to Indian food. We could be professional food critics, especially my father. So when we heard about Junoon and its reputation, we were obviously very intrigued. We always enjoy fine dining and have high expectations from establishments such as Junoon. Sadly though, this place fell pretty short. The decor and ambiance was nice. Felt spacious and had touches of Indian decor here and there. Went here with a large group a few months ago and they were very accommodating. We went here on a random weekday, so it wasn't very packed. The food and service however were sub-par. Definitely not Michelin star standards. For appetizers, I remember ordering the Lamb Chops as well as the Lamb Boti. We're pretty big on lamb and tend to try out the chops wherever we go. These were good, but not the best ones we've had. The Boti was a bit better than the chops. As for entrees, I recall ordering the Patiala Shahi Gosht, Daal Makhani amongst other things. The only dish I recall loving was the Paneer Makhani, which is technically not on the menu and was custom-made. The paneer was soft and just melted in your mouth. What a wonderful delight. Besides the paneer though, everything was just okay. Good, but something I could also get at any good, non-michelin starred Indian restaurant.

The food is not good because it was cold.  The portion was really small and sad looking; it was sad because the salmon, the curry and the rice was cold and not favorful lt was pre made and it was shown as it was pre made; and I had to wait 15 to 20mins for each courses.

3.0,3/1/2015,"**Restaurant Week Winter 2015**I visited Junoon for lunch as they are one of the ""better"" restaurants that offer lunch on Sundays during restaurant week.  Due to it's reputation from receiving a Michelin star, I came here with some high expectations.  I was able to score a table at 2:15pm - the earliest they had.I was really impressed by their grand lobby/waiting area out front before you get into the actual restaurant... I've never been to a fancy Indian restaurant, like, ever, so I wasn't sure what to expect.  There is a coat check, but nobody was actually working it.Decor: really modern, fancy lobby, but the inside looks somewhat lackluster and looks like a banquet hall.  Lots of space and high ceilings, however.Service: terrible.  This is something my friend and I both noticed.  It took them until right before dessert to refill our waters that were less than midway for most of the duration of the meal.  I struggled hailing anyone down because they were all running around frantically, although there were lots of them.  It also took us 15 min to get our appetizers and 15 min to get our dessert.  We were there for almost two hours... and we weren't even drinking.Appetizer: salmon tandoori.  I couldn't tell if this didn't taste like much because I had just brushed my teeth not long ago, or if this actually didn't taste like anything.  The salmon was cooked very nicely... loved that.  The accompanying sauce and little pieces of okra didn't do much to the dish, however.Main: lamb shank.  The lamb shank was cooked to absolute perfection - melt in your mouth fall-off-the-bone.  The sauce was a bit greasy but it was flavorful.  Comes with your choice of rice or naan.  I'd definitely go with the naan, as the rice was a bit on the hard side for me and the bread goes well with the sauce. I preferred my friend's traditional curry sauce over the one on my lamb shank, but it probably wouldn't go well with the shank.Desserts: date cake with spiced cream and coconut rice pudding.  The date cake was so flavorful and soaked in some sort of sweet delicious sauce and the spiced cream was amazing.... the coconut rice pudding not so muchI'm still not sure how I feel about fancy Indian food, since the cheap stuff suits me just fine.",6,2,1,Allene T.,"Manhattan, NY",2170,1311,3573

4.0,2/27/2015,"Upon entering Junoon, you feel the spaciousness, the tall door, the dim-lighted ambiance and the classy decor.  We were immediately greeted by the receptionist and were brought swiftly to our table.  The booth seating was appreciated.And so began our meal for restaurant week! We started off with the saloni maachi (tandoori salmon), and the ghost chili murgh tikka (tandoori chicken).  I didn't have the salmon but my friend said that it was cooked perfectly and was very tender and mild in spice.  I was impressed already because of the elements to my ghost chili murgh tikka--spaghetti squash, pistachio cream, and brown butter.  They weren't your typical Indian style dish.  But more so, the flavor was on spot.  The chicken was very tender.  Dab with a little brown butter and a little pistachio cream and you get the best worlds of both salt and nuttiness.  The spaghetti squash helped to balance out the dish with a bit of acidity.Next up was the entree, the real test.  We ordered the Murgh labadar (chicken tikka), and the Nadru Kofte (lotus root dumpling)--you know, cause I wanted to try something new and untypical.  The Nadru Kofte wasn't quite what I was expecting since usually dumplings have a flour based shell wrapping the filling.  The dumpling seemed more like entirely filling, but pressed to the shape of a dumpling.  It was a lighter dish and you could taste the crunch and texture of the minced lotus root.  The sauce was flavorful and lightly sweet too.  As for the Murgh Labadar--the chicken again was cooked to tenderness and perfection.  The sauce had a little spicy kick to it.  Meanwhile, the entrees were good, they were a bit more on the traditional side and a change from the appetizer.  The entrees were also served with either naan or rice.  I felt the naan could have been fluffier, and if they gave us garlic naan, that would be even better.Last was the dessert.  We ordered the coconut rice pudding.  The portion was small.  The pudding itself, however, was nice and creamy.  The coconut flavor was also very apparent.  The coconut shreds, tamarind jelly, and braised cashews added texture to the creaminess.  All in all, service was really amazing.  Our cups were refilled all the time, the waiters were all helpful and speedy, and we were asked for our opinions throughout the meal.  Junoon gave a great experience, but the entree and dessert wasn't as wow factor as the appetizer.  I would definitely go for a regular meal though.",0,0,0,Nathaniel L.,"Flushing, Queens, NY",74,80,178

5.0,2/17/2015,"Junoon! Truly class  and contemporary Indian cuisine . The restaurant is located on 24th street and it was pretty tough to find street parking but you might just get lucky . We were warmly greeted and seated comfortably. The place has a very humble , simple and traditional Indian touch without fancy decor and glam. I was impressed with the look and feel and for those who wish to know more about Indian spices you have all the information to read about and learn - even something about the Chef Vikas Khanna . Drinks - tried the Mumbai margarita - tequila with fresh mango purée with rose chili syrup and lime was extremely enticing and a must try! The pomegranate tai Mai is a non alcoholic mock tail with freshly squeezed mango , pomegranate and lime juice with a hint of basil, can't get better refreshing ! Appetizer - we were recommended to try the Murg Lababdar ( tandoor roasted chicken with tomato gravy, ginger and fenugreek leaf) the chicken was very well done and was savory and left wanting more ! As I am vegetarian in nature and don't try chicken too often this one was an exception . Lunch Menu- has some interesting and tantalizing picks. We tried the vegetarian thali - served with daal, rice, pudina raita and roti. The curries were exceptionally tasty and distinct to the palette included punjabi kadhi( chickpea flour and buttermilk spiced soup) gobi aur saag ki bhurji ( cauliflower curry with traditional spices- tasted great but may contain some excess ginger that made the dish little strong ) paneer aur mirchi Ka Salan ( cottage cheese/ tofu in spicy cashew gravy with peppers- was out of the world with typical fennel aroma) Now coming to the meat lovers- my husband tried the Lamb Kolhapuri( lamb in red chili curry with coconut , star anise and poppy seeds) accompanied with special junoon spiced naan ( contains mozzarella and house spices - well done soft and yummy )          The best part of the meal is definitely the desserts and this leaves the experience even more satisfying. We picked the Coconut rice pudding which was amazing - garnished with date glaze and almonds. Pistachio Mousse was superb as well with some mouth watering dressing- licked the plate off literally .

Naan and rice were also perfectly prepared and the rice pudding was actually the stand-out of their desserts on offer that day.

They were a bit cleaner dishes than average Indian cuisine, but just not really worth the relative expense, in my opinion. A decent meal in a nice environment, just a bit too expensive.",0,0,0,Dennis J.,"New York, NY",13,792,33

Cauliflower wrapped in some sort of red sauce. It's quite flavorful and delicious, but not as good as some of the previous review said it is.Nanoosh kebab: lamb wrapped in chicken. Very strong flavor and taste, authentic. My bf loves it.Chicken tandoori: Amazing tomato based sauce. The chicken is very tender. I dipped the cheesy naan in the sauce and was very happy. I saved some of it for breakfast the next day. Still good.Lamb shank: bf ordered this. He likes it a lot.

When trying to create a fusion menu there is a very fine line of not overdoing it, this is what I saw with most of the food here. Most of the things don't even taste like Indian food, they at least need to maintain or keep the flavors or little bit of spices.Coming to service one of our servers was really good but other one was very disappointing, he could not describe the menu items or explain the dish served to us.

1.0,10/11/2014,"Please kindly excuse me for what will be a scathing review. This restaurant absolutely sucks. *Absolutely.* There. I said it. If you consider that statement to be rude, then I apologize. Nonetheless, hopefully the restaurant can improve after reading what a valued customer has to say. Although the service is pretentiously superfluous and customers are made to feel artificially pampered, the food (other than the appetizers) is terrible. I feel appalled and insulted that this restaurant receives such prestige from the Michelin system. I thought that if a restaurant has multiple Michelin stars, it is supposed to have amazing food. In this case, Michelin has made an unforgivable and outstanding error. What happened? There must be cronyism going on. Someone should report it. It's not fair. It's wrong. Junoon doesn't deserve a Michelin star. It deserves one star out of five on Yelp. Above all else, I must thank the wait staff for being such friendly people. They're doing a great job, and I'm sorry that I have such a negative opinion of their restaurant. I'm giving one star because the food is so unacceptable that regardless of the price of the experience or the inside ambiance, no one should ever have to eat packaged baby spinach leaves, canned tomatoes, previously frozen green beans and potatoes, and goat with predominately bone while dining in a restaurant. A young child could have easily made a better dinner with the same kitchen and food materials.My friend made reservations for 7:30 on a Friday night. We dress up and come from Brooklyn. We arrive on time and are seated by the hostess. Our appetizers were quite good. They were the best thing here. I appreciated the way the cauliflower was wrapped up inside in the lahsooni gobhi, and the tomato sauce tasted fresh. One of our waiters took the time to explain the intricacies of the dish, which was unnecessary. His explanation is simply a facade used to make up for the future disappointment of the entrees. The eggplant chaat was okay. Anyone can easily see how this restaurant works. They cater to people who don't know anything about Indian food and serve you something they identify as Indian food. They woo you with fine wine and exceptional wine service, they handprint the restaurant's name on the restroom paper towels, they deliver you a hot towel at the end of the meal, and they fold your napkin for you while you're away in the restroom. They need to do these things because no one would eat here if they didn't do those things. We ordered wine, too, which was good. I got the one from France. We ordered naan and roti. The roti wasn't good. It tasted stale, and I expected something fresh. I initially ordered one entree: aloo beans poryal. It lacked so much in flavor that I had to order a second entree (Gobi aur Saag ke Bhurji), which was equally bad. The aloo beans poryal was so awful that I thought there was a mistake. Am I really at Junoon? I needed to give them a second chance with the Gobi aur Saag. As I previously stated, every vegetable I ate was either frozen or canned, which is shameful. They try to hide this information from you with the assistance of coconut, fenugreek leaves, and other random herbs that don't belong in an Indian dish. Junoon doesn't deserve to be in business as an Indian restaurant. They would be better as a wine bar.My second entree was an embarrassment. Why throw a bunch of packaged and canned vegetables together, top it with some garlic, and call it a meal? Anyone can do that. Furthermore, when you order a spinach dish, you generally receive a purée form (think of palak paneer). Never have I ever seen baby spinach leaves from Earthbound farms. Perhaps the restaurant thinks this is cutting-edge, but it definitely backfired. When you typically order a potato dish, you can expect to receive pieces of potato that are each unique in shape. Someone cuts by hand the potato. In the case of Junoon, they pour potatoes out of a package from Walmart and call it exquisite. Both of my entrees didn't taste good. Frozen Indian dinners taste much better. Wegmans or Trader Joes have you covered. My friend ordered a goat dish (patiala shahi goat), but his goat was mostly bone. Again, that is unacceptable and atypical. Giving him mostly bone is simply a way to increase profits at the expense of the customer. I paid $101 at the end of the night for a lackluster meal that included two glasses of wine, roti, an appetizer, and two entrees. I consider it worth it for the many inside jokes my friends and I created. In addition, I got to write an extensive yelp review and warn others to never eat here. I plead with you to frequent anywhere else. My friends spent $60 and $56, respectively. If you have $101 to spend, I recommend donating to an Indian children's charity instead. This way, you may help others in need. Unfortunately I cannot recommend this restaurant to anyone.",13,12,5,Jerry B.,"Laytonsville, MD",378,424,188

The Punjabi kadi was best among the all three as it was cooked in sunflower oil (usually it is cooked in normal refined oil). The other two were ok. The presentation was good and the thali was a traditional Punjabi utensil which allowed the 3 entree, daal (dried pulses) , rice and one desert to fit. We also ordered two cocktails.

The waiter suggested a vegetable with our meal and we last minute got the brusell sprouts which were quite spicy. And of-course the garlic nann to round out the meal. The highlight of the night was actually the Sommelier. He was excellent genuinely knew all about the wines and even gave me a small lesson which was much appreciated. He recommended the perfect bottle of riesling something affordable and crisp slightly sweeter than the per glass version they were pouring.,2,1,1,Maya B.,"Manhattan, NY",106,153,218

The best part was the lamb with the pickled strawberries. My girlfriend (who had never particularly liked lamb in the past) at first was hesitant as first, but the waiter promised that she would like their lamb and he was right-- it was the best lamb she and I have ever tasted before. No where else compares. We tried going to different places to see if she ""likes lamb now"" but no, it is only Junoon's lamb that will do",0,0,0,J J.,"Brooklyn, NY",1,22,1
3.0,9/24/2014,"I'd noted Junoon for upwards of a year before I finally made a visit for a weekend lunch over NYC's Restaurant Week. It is one of three of Michelin-starred Indian restaurants and the chef, Vikas Khanna, has been awarded the title of ""New York's Hottest Chef"" by Eater two years in a row [1]. Although he didn't appear to be present the day of my visit, I was nonetheless excited upon first stepping into the restaurant; the modern waiting room was only a precursor to the expansive dining area, complete with generously spaced tables, semi-delineated dining areas, and curtained floor-to-ceiling windows across the perimeter of the room. It's elegant, modern, and inviting, an ambiance that's hard to achieve in most venues nowadays.I went with the three-course prix fixe, and started with the ""Kebab"" Chipotle Chicken Tikka appetizer. There was no clumsy stick to deal with on the plate, but the chicken did maintain a smoky, char-grilled flavor and was still extremely tender on the interior. The flavor of the chipotle marinade didn't seem to come through successfully, and the perhaps too-elegant garnishes of a lime aioli, and a chili-cilantro gelee appeared to be an afterthought.I was looking forward to the Lamb Kolhapuri, a dish that consisted of lamb ""simmered in a spicy curry"". The presence of a few red chili peppers in the bowl, all against an opaque, tan-hued curry broth, was a promising first impression. There was a substantial amount of flavor in the curry, with hints of coconut, a punch of star anise, and white poppy seeds. It brought out the best in the lamb, which was cooked to a good tenderness and had just the right amount of gameyness.The meal finished with the Coconut Rice Pudding, a tiny portion of rice pudding that was topped with Medjool Dates, Rum Glaze, and a few pieces of crunchy Candied Almonds. It was a light, neatly sweetened dessert for the meal that covered the whole spectrum of textures and flavors... but unfortunately disappeared in just a few spoonfuls.Junoon has a difficult task of taking an ethnic cuisine and trying to elevate and refine it into something that falls into the category of ""fine dining"". For the most part, they're successful; the flavors, the ingredients, and execution is there, although there are indeed instances when the showiness seems to take precedence over the most important element: the taste.--[1] ny.eater.com/2012/2/17/6…",7,4,3,Lori L.,"New York, NY",2244,608,6827

1.0,9/15/2014,"The first time I visited Junoon, I went with the expectation of a crappy food place made famous by a cute chef.  I was totally blown away by the food, the service the ambiance and the overall experience was truly memorable.  Fast forward to September of 2014, I left with the experience of the expectation I had the last time.  We were a bit earlier than our reservation so decided to get a drink at the bar.  I am fine paying the hefty amount for a creative drink, so we ordered a Mumbai Margarita and a Tandoori Martini.  There was nothing creative about it, please please educate your bartender on how to be better at his drinks.  It took forever for us to get the drinks, the drinks of other customers were just at the bar getting watered down and waiting to be delivered.  I at one point wanted to just pick up the drink and have it myself to not waste it.  There was nothing Tandoori about the Martini and no flavor of Mumbai in the margarita.  Please don't fancy name your drinks when you don't have that to offer.  Let's move from the bar to the table and on to our palate teaser (we should have taken the hint here and left).  To give you a taste imagine putting a sour cherry covered with cardamom and rolled in pistachio in your mouth.  It wasn't a tease it was more of an attack of cardamom.   Our server more of a sales person than a server took our orders.  We ordered piri piri shrimp, noorani kebab, corn kebab and naan to start off with.  It took them about 45 minutes to deliver the apps.  To our surprise all the apps were stone cold, including our tandoori naan.  I haven't seen a place even a small buffet place serve cold naan.  We had to wait another thirty minutes for the server to pay us attention so we can tell him that the food is cold (of course we are eating as we are waiting because we were starving at this point).  So after apologizing for the mistake they go ahead and warm up the food that was left so we can eat as the food was ""intended to be served"".  I am not sure if we were being punished by not being served in the right way in the beginning.  Then we wait and we wait and wait for our entrees to come, thankfully they were still warm, but that was about the only good part of it.  I am not sure if the restaurant is advertising a cardamom seller, or found them cheap at a whole sale, but every single dish was just overpowering with that spice.  It is a very delicate spice and you really need to know how to use it correctly.  There was nothing special about the Junoon special naan, the cheese I couldn't taste it, neither the garlic.  Needless to say we went a hole in the wall restaurant after that left us with a true taste of India.  Also, since the wine bottle is not left at the table in fine dining and served to you, our glasses were sitting empty for more than once waiting on our bottle to show up.  I am truly saddened by this experience at Junoon as I was a big fan and so very proud of an Indian restaurant doing so well and achieving such success.  I personally feel like an Indian I was let down by my countrymen.   Well maybe this is a restaurant hyped by a celebrity chef, and maybe my first time was a fluke.  We will never know as it was customary to eat at this place with every NYC visit, this is no longer in the list of places to dine.  Upon expressing our concern we did get a 25% discount on the meal, but we were not looking for that.  We had gladly spent a hefty amount the first time, but experiences and memories cannot be discounted.",1,0,0,Trupti T.,"Holly Springs, NC",71,249,1222

And the duck.  Other than that it was run of the mill flavor.  I would not go back to junoon given the price point and other options.  Its really a 2.5.  Not bad but nothing special.,1,2,0,Rob T.,"Manhattan, NY",2,45,0

1.0,9/2/2014,"I don't know how this place was given a michelin star. My friends and I made reservations to celebrate my boyfriend's birthday here days beforehand. They asked me at the time I made the reservation if I had any special requests and I told them we'd be celebrating a birthday and wanted a dessert brought out at the end with candles. They said it'd be no problem.I was impressed when we first arrived and the hostess was taking us to our seats because she quietly asked me who's birthday we were celebrating and it seemed they must have made a note to themselves when I made the reservation about the dessert at the end. Off to a good start.Shortly after we were seated we ordered an expensive bottle of wine. which was delicious. However, the guy asking whether we wanted regular water or sparkling water only asked for some people's preferences and not others and then got everything mixed up. Ok. Not the biggest deal in the world.After sitting for a few minutes we all started to realize how hot it was in the restaurant. Very hot. We ignored it for awhile but then my boyfriend asked one of the hostesses up front if the AC was on. She said yes. A few minutes later he asked a different hostess if they wouldn't mind turning it down a little bit. She then told him the AC had been on the fritz for about 5 hours and wouldn't be fixed until tomorrow. It was about 90 degrees in NY that day and extremely uncomfortable in the restaurant. It was after 9:00 at night and you'd think they'd at least prop the front door open or something to get some air circulating.We had to flag down our waiter multiple times after waiting to order our food for about 45 minutes. For every stage of dinner we had to track someone down.My best friend's confidence in the service became nil and she was worried they'd screw up the dessert with candles at the end, so she excused herself halfway through dinner, pretending to take a phone call to make sure the staff knew to bring out what we wanted. The staff said it was absolutely going to be taken care of.Sure enough. We ordered dessert and nothing. No candles. No nothing. Seriously?! We only told them three times, spent over $300 on dinner, and they couldn't do that much. A place like Olive Garden can get that right, but Junoon with their michelin star can't? Pathetic. We had to tell them to fix it immediately. Instead of knocking something off the price, they brought a couple of chocolates. Wow. Thanks. We really didn't think it could get any worse until we were standing up to leave and one of the waiters said, ""Remember to have your next birthday here."" Seriously?!

4.0,8/15/2014,"I have been looking for a good Indian restaurant for awhile, since my fav place closed down on the UWS, so I was excited to see Junoon on the list of restaurants for  Restaurant Week and I have to say, I was not let down.  I was impressed by the quality of food, cocktails, and desserts, especially the shrimp curry entree, which had a perfect amount of spice to it, without being overwhelming.  I like my dishes very spicy, so it's hard for me to find restaurants that can be great on their heat for spice, but restrain enough, where it's not overwhelming, so the taste remains and Junoon accomplishes this surprisingly well. One of my favorites of the night, was the Junoon Spiced Gruyere Cheese Naan, which a good cheese naan is very hard to find in NYC, so I was excited by how great their naan was.  Then only reason why I am giving this place a 4 stars, rather than 5 stars, is for their decor and atmosphere.  This place tries too hard to build intimate atmosphere...   some other Yelpers have rated this place as hip in its decor, and I think they must have not have had their glasses on or have never been to a truly hip place in NYC, because the main dining area is far from hip. I would describe this more as a dark, cavernous cafeteria type of ambiance. Honestly, it's a weird vibe, due to the the setup of the restaurant but the food is delicious, so I will be back.  If you are looking for really good Indian food and cocktails, then definitely try this place out, but be warned about the ""trying-too"" hard atmosphere.",1,0,1,Ash H.,"Manhattan, NY",5,39,8

I've been to nicer and more expensive restaurants but I've never come across anything like this. $35 is especially crazy for an Indian restaurant because you eat family style, so it's not like you can order a bunch of expensive entrees and call it a day. After ordering way more food than we wanted to, we were hoping the quality would at least make up for the weird price restriction but we were disappointed again. The chicken tikka starter was dry and nothing at all like the last time. The paneer mirchi ka salan was bland and the paneer itself was too hard, definitely not good quality.

4.0,8/7/2014,"Was taken here tonight for my birthday. Indian cuisine is my favorite and I had been wanting to try Junoon. We opted for the restaurant week menu. First of all, the restaurant is spacious and beautiful, if a bit too dimly lit to see the menu. The service was so sweet and friendly and efficient...I think this was my favorite part of the evening. One waiter even spoke with us for a while about India and traditions. The food...some of it was spectacular. The Manchurian cauliflower appetizer was done perfectly...crispy, flavorful...though I could have used a couple more pieces. The shrimp curry was delicious as well...maybe one more shrimp? There were 3. We got an extra dish because my friend is pregnant and hungry! That was a spicy paneer dish. They warned us that this was their spiciest dish, but it was barely spicy at all! Subtly flavored, as were most of their dishes. This isn't the highly spiced traditional cooking of most restaurants. This is elegant, subtle cooking and it's nice for a change but maybe not too often. Oh, desserts...almost forgot because, well, they were kind of forgettable. The rice pudding lacked the rich fragrance and flavor of kheer, though the almonds were a nice touch. The chocolate cheesecake was just plain weird. Odd flavors, smokey, salty...not sure what it was. It didn't taste at all Indian. It was pretty, though! If i come back, it will be for the cauliflower appetizer and the amazing service. They would not let my pregnant friend go downstairs to the public bathroom and instead, insisted on her using the employee restroom. That's class!

My wife ordered chocolate cheesecake for dessert and it was BAD! Tasted weird. The rice pudding was very good especially the toppings.Service - was great. They made sure that they took plates on time and the staff was very courteous.No Kids Policy - Good that I don't have kids but not cool!! Will I go back? - Never.

1.0,8/5/2014,"The review is for our visit on 09/21//2013I am going to really detail this out, because this was one experience I wish no one else should have. It has lot of smaller things and many lasting impressions.It was my wife's birthday (09/21/2013), we went for the dinner. We were hoping to have a good time, but everything went south.Let me begin with how it started - My wife made the reservation for 4 a day before (i.e. 09/20), the person taking reservation kept her on hold on multiple times she did mentioned to the person taking the booking that it is her birthday and finally the booking went thruWe arrived at the restaurant by around 7.50 PM (our reservation was for 8 PM). The lady at the front desk told us it will take 5 minutes to prepare the table and that was it no mention of where can we wait or sit while the table gets ready - no eye contact nothing.Finally our table was ready, and we went in, couple of minutes later the server came in. This guy who was the server for our table for the night i must honestly tell would have been the most rude server I have met.The guy didn't even introduced himself, and came straight to the point with drinks Menu. On top of that, when we made the reservation didn't  the person taking the book would have put a note that it is a birthday dinner - shouldn't the server greet us. The guy didn't even said ""Welcome to Junoon"".Finally we placed in food orders, we ordered -In Appetizers - Lahsoni Gobhi & Murg Tikka Mirza HasnuIn Main Course - Daal Makhani,  Paneer Salan, Patiala Shahi Goat with Couple of Garlic Naan, a Lacha Paratha & a Missi RotiMurg Tikka Mirza Hasnu was nice, but Lahsoni Gobhi was way below mark, let me tell you why - There was no ""Lahsoni flavor"" (garlic) on it- Gobhi pieces are too big, and from inside it was completely raw.At that time I let go, because it was one item, and it was no big deal.Thn came in the main CourseWe had great expectations with ""Patiala Shashi Goat"", because reading it's description we were under the impression that it will be full of flavor. But what it tasted like was as if someone has boiled the Goat pieces and served it on a Gravy without any flavors in it. We were really disappointed with that and in10 minutes the server came in to check on us (that was the only time he came to check on us), & I told him about the Goat. He said he will ""FIX"" it. I could easily say a slow cooked goat in a handi cannot be fixed like this, but we wanted to give that another chance.When the goat came back, my friend tried it, he was about to say there is no change in taste, but right before that another guy came in, with another bowl of Goat, and said they have given us the wrong one by mistake, and the one which is ""FIXED"" for us is what he brought in.We said ""It's ok"" - so the first taste I took of the one ""FIXED"" goat had only ONE SPICE added to it ""CHILLIS"", it tasted as if they have put a ""Tadka of Red Mirch Powder"" in it.I waited for couple of minutes for server to come check in on us again, but he didn't cared. So finally I called him, and asked for the manager.Next want happened was really shameful, because I was seeing what was happening around - First thing this guy did, is with a very rude face said ""OK"" (nothing else).Then he caught a guy (who looked as if he was the manager) and started talking - from my table I could see these two guys talking right after that and this guy who I thought is the Manager during that time was continuously pointing fingers at our table.Thn this guy disappeared for next 10 minutes. And another guy comes up to our table, and asked us that if we are disappointed with ""Goat"", I explained him what is the problem with the dish, and I explained him what was the problem with the ""Lahsoni Gobhi"" - the only answer he had is he will take the ""Goat"" off our bill - nothing else. Added to my disappoint, I had nothing left after this much disappointment and told him we will do the check now. He didn't even noticed when server took the ""Goat"" to get it ""Fixed"" we ordered couple of extra Naan and another Daal Makhani which were lying on our table ""untouched"".Thn after clearing the table they brought in the piece of cake for my wife. Guess what, the same server as he brought that, comes on the table and ask's ""Who's birthday it is"" and then just puts the piece of cake in front of my wife and walked away - he didn't even had the courtesy to say ""Happy Birthday"".Then he came in very next moment and handed the check to me.Goat was definitely taken off, but no care for the food we couldn't eat because of that.Thn walks in the mngr one more time, he wished my wife, and made sure he said he took the Goat off. I told him that you should have considered the extra Daal Makhani & Naan which we couldn't eat, he said nxt time when you come in, please inform us in advance about your taste"" What a shame",0,0,0,Gaurav K.,"Stamford, CT",15,8,3

2.0,7/27/2014,"NYC RESTAURANT WEEK 2014It really is A-OK.. My sister and I love indian food and we were really excited to find such a good place available during RW. Our indian friends told us it was great and the YELP reviews were Black and White, Love it or Hate it. The restaurant itself is of course very dark, very dim lighting. It does not look like your ordinary indian restaurant but more like a fancy, modern restaurant with very subtle hints of India here and there.Before you order, they serve you this drink: a long-shot of milk and spices. My sister loved it, but I really didn't like it: it was too condensed and the spices were slightly off.Appetizer:I had the Apricot Salad, sweet mango, homemade cheese and pineapple vinaigrette. Very light, there was more salad than anything else, which is fine for an appetizer. It was light, the seared apricot weren't too sweet. The mango however was tasteless. The sauce had a strong sent of pineapple and was really good. It was a good and light way to start off the dinner.Entree:I ordered Cauliflower, tomato and fenugreek with jasmine rice (you have the choice between that and naan bread). Just like any indian restaurant you have a plate and the food comes in a bowl and you serve yourself. The plate was (intentionally?) hot, which  keeps the food warm longer. I can't say that it was bad. It wasn't good, it was A-OK. It lacked spices, they could have asked me if I wanted my food to be spicy or not for example. It was well cooked, the textures were interesting and it was not at all greasy (it was the first time my plate didn't shine after indian food). I ordered some hot sauce on the side to spice it up a little bit because it was just okay. The rice was very good however. Well cooked and flavorful. Dessert:We shared the Spicy Chocolate Cheesecake and the Coconut Rice Pudding with caramelized almonds. By the end of our entrees, we were fearing desserts; we were excepting huge plates with abnormally large portions. Luckily, they were very small. So the pudding is served in a tiny bowl, that doesn't even come on a plate, I mean it's not that hard.. I never had rice pudding because I think it's a weird dessert.. But this one was actually good. I didn't feel the coconut enough however. The caramelized almonds were succulent. As for the cheesecake, it wasn't spicy but it was still good and very light. It too was small, but it was enough. It's accompanied with a side of whipped cream, which looked like ice cream.When we asked for the check, the total was 88$ (38$ each + Yogurt for my sister), the waiter retrieved 125$ from the credit card and when we called him over he said ""Oh what did I do now?"" I thought ""Oh wow, he must be a regular screw up then!""All and all, Junoon is a place that I wouldn't go to if it weren't Restaurant Week. The food is over-priced for something that is A-OK. Even if it is RW and maybe they're not doing their best, this is what I will judge them on.

4.0,7/21/2014,"KenScale: 8.0/10Junoon is a moden Indian restaurant in the Flatiron area. I have a huge crush on Indian food and need to get a take-out every once in a while, but haven't been to that many formal Indian restaurants before. Junoon has long been one of the more well-known high-end Indian places in the city, and has therefore been on my radar for a while now. I finally made a visit recently and, while I wish the food overall were a bit more spiced up, they were all very well-prepared.I started out with piri-piri shrimp and lamb boti kebab, both excellent starts to the meal in terms of flavor and texture. For the main course, I shared a bunch of items along with Junoon spiced naan and vegetable and paneer viryani rice. While lobster curry with coconut milk was somewhat underwhelming despite its hefty price tag at $40, I did enjoy straightforward classics like tandoori poussin and lamb chops that were both perfectly cooked. I liked the modern touches of all the dishes, but the dinner would've been even more outstanding had they been more spiced up to showcase the versatility and kick of Indian spice. For dessert, coconut rice pudding and date gateau were both great desserts that were not overly sweet.The restaurant has that pretty classic (but not stuffy) vibe going on, with white tablecloths and uniformed staffs. It has a full bar with some cocktails that sound interesting, but I would go with red wine instead. Getting a reservation at Junoon is not particularly challenging as long as you plan ahead a day or two.

2.0,7/2/2014,"We were a group of 6 and had reserved a table in the Patiala room. Vikas Khanna's fame and the rave reviews of Junoon had us stoked. We expected amobrosial food, which would give us foodgasms. However, we were rather disappointed with the entire experience, and it definitely did not do justice to the prices charged.Food was rather bland and it was cold, and we had to return the food to get it warmed  up before serving, which though the server readily did wasn't something expected from a michelin recommended restaurant. The ambience was incosistent and kind of confused where traditional Indian furnishings were merged with average restauranty furniture. The walls in Patiala room had damp splotches probably from plumbing issues and plain sight of that in a fine dine restaurant doesn't look appealing.The food overall tasted decent, but if this restaurant were in India it would not hold such a position of esteem. Overall we concurred that there are tonnes of way nicer restaurants in NYC where we could go for a fine-dine experience and if we craved Indian it might be worth going to smaller establishments which serve better food.

We ordered the chicken lababador, yellow daal, lamb boti kabobs, gobi aur saag and garlic naan to get a good variety of dishes. The lamb ($20) was about 4 pieces of pretty rubbery meat with weird cheese on it. The gobi saag and yellow daal were extremely bland and just missing that authentic indian taste. The chicken dish was probably the best thing we ordered, but not at all better than any other indian restaurant in the city and definitely not worth the absurd price for just 5-6 pieces of chicken. It took a long time for the food to come out, and our water was never refilled.

It's truly a beautiful restaurant here- warm/ romantic lighting. Trendy with a touch of Indian decor. When you head to the restroom to wash up, you can also get a glimpse into the spice room which is pretty cool. For dinner last night, we were seated in the dining room which was not that full when we arrived but was starting to get packed when we were finishing up our 5 course prefixe.  For our special, we had a set 5 courses which we did not get to choose from. Despite not having our own choices, we loved the 5 that were picked out for us. Each dish is quite small (as tastings usually are) but that way we were able to enjoy each plate in it's entirety. I'm really glad we opted for the wine pairing on top of the tasting, so that we could try a wide range of wines and dishes from Junoon. Typically, I've had a lot of sommeliers at restaurants just pick out your wine and tell you the name of it. The one that Shing and I had last night was both really knowledgeable and interesting to listen to which made our own Michelin experience even better. Our server was also a delight and made our dinner so enjoyable. My favorites were definitely the lamb and salmon dishes. Although I am not a huge fan of spicy food, I still managed to finish and enjoy every last bite of my dinner. I kept my drink in one hand and kept eating because I loved every dish, spicy and all. I typically do not each Indian food often, but I think this was a really pleasant experience to try new cuisine in an amazing restaurant. I really enjoyed the service from the server and sommelier and would definitely go back because of them (and obviously for the delicious food). Remember to save some room for dessert because the coconut pudding is totally worth it! On my way out, I even ran into my college classmate who was entertaining family visiting from India.

We decided to use the Groupon to celebrate our 2nd anniversary and we were not disappointed. Our 5 course tasting menu was delicious, beautifully presented, and more filling than one could expect.- Amuse bouche - we had crackers topped with crab and goat cheese. I didn't really taste any crab but this was good. - Fluke tadka - this flaky white fish was presented sashimi style with mustard seeds, fried curry leaf, coconut oil, and cilantro. The fish was fresh and the ingredients really made for an authentic South Indian flavor. - Tandoori Octopus - enjoyed this more than I thought I would - the octopus was cooked well and not chewy. It could almost be mistaken for chicken. The tandoori flavor was there and it was served with an aioli and beets (or radishes? Not sure).- Chipotle chicken - the chicken was melt in your mouth tender and had a balanced chipotle flavor. It came with potato confit, nice and crispy, and a strong Chipotle mayo, aioli, and a cilantro gelee. The sauces were the same colors as the Indian flag - nice touch. This was probably my favorite dish. We were also given a basket of cheese-stuffed naan and a basket of regular, which definitely helped to fill us up even more. - Lamb kholapuri - this curry contains lamb cooked in a spicy tomato gravy served over basmati rice. It was good but didn't taste like anything special, and at this point I was full off of the other courses (and the naan....oh the naan.) - Dessert sampler -  came with 3 bite size desserts - # dense chocolate cake with whipped cream, a milky burfi-like dessert with a cardamom-y raspberry, and a pastry with lychee. They also gave us chocolates and sugar coated apricot or orange candy with out bill. Desserts were sweet and just the right size. All in all the food was good and definitely left us more satisfied than other more expansive (and pricey) tasting menus. The ambiance was dim and romantic. Since we came when they opened for dinner there was a bit of an initial wait for food but the dishes started rolling in. 2 hours later, there was a good sized dinner crowd.

4.0,5/10/2014,"We originally planned to come here with a party of eight but that number dropped to five after the news about going to a Michelin star rated Indian restaurant was bought up. We showed up about a half hour behind schedule but they seated us relatively quickly. This restaurant is NOT your typical Indian restaurant by any means. You won't get chicken tikka masala, tandoori chicken or any of that other Americanized ""non sense"" here..... Sort of. My wife and I are Indian but the rest of the gang were from countries south of the equator. Two of the folks right off the bat were disappointed by the portion sizes....(it's a Michelin star rated restaurant..... Come on now!) We ordered the lamb boti kebab, chicken biryani, patiala goat, eggplant chat, lamb chops, Kerala shrimp curry, tandoori octopus and the list goes on. Everything was beautifully cooked, as we would expect from the Presidents executive Indian chef.... Impressive indeed. I'm not too sure about our guests, but they didn't seem to be very overwhelmed. The chocolate cake infused with garam masala is a waste of time but the kulfi trio was great....the paan masala flavor won't work so well for everyone though. The bartender is supposedly one of the top fifty bartenders in the world and he made us a few ""custom"" cocktails based on what we enjoy drinking..... They were all excellent and he even came over to our table to explain them all. At the end of our dinner, we discovered that all of our servers spoke our native tongue, Bengali... So that was a special treat for us. Overall, this place is awesome and very different from the ""other"" Michelin star rated Indian restaurant. You'll need to try both to understand why I say that.

It doesn't take 30+ minutes to clean and set a table, so my guess is they forgot about us. After being seated, it took forever to get menus and service. We ordered a 80 dollar bottle of wine and the wine guy was a complete jerk. He was sarcastic and rude acting as if I knew nothing about wine. He then tasted the bottle we ordered, which I found extremely unprofessional. When our meals were delivered, they mixed up a dish my girlfriend had ordered with a friend's across the table. My girlfriend told the same wine guy that this was not the dish she order and he argued with her. Eventually he realized the mix up and then swapped the dishes even though the woman across the table had already started eating off that plate! Completely unacceptable. When the night was almost over, I asked if we had finished the wine because the bottle had been removed from the table. They brought the wine back and there was still a third left.

I put a note in the reservation that it would be my husband's birthday, and if there was anything special they could do, it would be very much appreciated.When we arrived after having seen a show a Broadway, we were seated immediately in a romantic corner and presented with our menus.  Our server brought the beverage menus and gave us some time to mull over them.  We chose the Blood Orange Sour and Mumbai Margarita. When we looked at the dining menu, a personalized birthday message was printed at the top. They let us keep the personalized copy of the menu, and throughout the night, the servers stopped by to wish my husband a happy birthday.  We also ended up ordering the Bourbon Rose and a spicy pineapple and tequila cocktail of which I can't quite recollect the name, but it was my husband's favorite of the evening.All of the flavors were in balance and spiced just so as not to overpower the original flavors of the fish/meat keeping the flavors clean, bright, and fresh.  The menu is seasonal, so you might not find these dishes listed below anymore at Junoon.  Here are the highlights:- Fluke Tadka: One would never see raw fish on an Indian restaurant menu, but the Fluke Tadka was a can't-miss with the traditional Indian herbs and spices of mustard seeds, curry leaf, and green chili cooled by the sweetness of the baby coconut and the raw fluke's creamy texture.- Shahi Lamb Shank: If you love lamb, the Shahi Lamb Shanks were an incredible of sweet and savory, spicy and creamy. Braised for five hours in a black cumin and rose curry and topped with brown butter-steeped cashews, golden raisins, and black currants, the meat just falls off of the bone with barely a nudge.The service was spot on, and the atmosphere was classy and romantic.  All in all a beautiful night out that made my husband feel very special.",1,0,0,Sophia H.,"Brooklyn, NY",42,63,73

Sexy ambiance, excellent service (attentive, made recommendations, suggested wines, but not annoying and rushing you.) Food was super interesting and tasty. It was expensive, yes, but worth the experience.Last weekend, complete opposite experience. From the moment we walked in, things were downhill. Our table wasn't ready at our reserved time, so we thought we'd sit in the lounge (where we had our dinner last time.) Completely different decor, with kids sleeping on the couches and rowdy groups. The entire ambiance of before was lost - large and rowdy crowds, not dimly lit, etc. I love family friendly restaurants, but not when I'm paying the amount I did for this meal.As I was waiting I thought I'd use the restroom. It smelled terrible and was not clean. Also, peeling paint and uncleanliness everywhere you looked.Finally they seated us, but our food came super slow and the service was horrible (e.g. servers clearing our food before we were done, person pouring our wine tasting didn't actually know what the wines were, etc.) They put us in a side room that was meant for larger groups - I felt like I was in a casual dining atmosphere. Again, fine, but not when you're paying this kind of money.The staff came to apologize at the end for the slow and poor service, but at that point it was too late....Used to recommend this place to friends.

We could tell from the outside of the restaurant that it was a fancy place. I'm used to around the way Indian food which is pretty tasty but at a decent price. The decor in this restaurant is very nice. It had a nice upscale feel to it. We were seated right away on a Sunday evening with no reservations. Looking over the menu I didn't recognize some of the dishes. My boyfriend who is Indian didn't recognize them either. The prices are pretty steep. We ordered wine and received 1/4 of a glass for about fifteen dollars each. We knew from this that the portion they serve would be sparse as well. We ordered a shrimp appetizer which came with three pieces of shrimp.It was very good but wished there was one more piece of shrimp lol. We ordered a chicken dish with garlic nan and shared it. It was very tasty and the nan tasted very fresh. For dessert we had a spiced chocolate cake which was delicious but two bites and it was finished, there was barely any cake on the plate.

2.0,4/10/2014,"So I went to Junoon for dinner. It was actually somewhat of an early dinner, perhaps my reservation was at 5:30 or 6. Their beautiful main dinning room hardly had anyone, but they decided to hide me in the corner of their not-so-sexy secondary  room (usually reserved for events). While the atmosphere in their main dinning area is quite sexy, with chic decor and dim lighting, the room where I was placed was hardly decorated and just didn't have any charm. Obviously, I was offended by this...Their food was okay, I must say the appetizer was very nicely plated. The entree, however, didn't blow my mind. I felt like the presentation and the food itself was just too homey. For the price, I would have prefer eating at a low-key Indian restaurant that is going to give me similar food and quality. Perhaps I wouldn't have been so sour to these prices, if I felt that it came with amazing service and great atmosphere. Given that I was placed in the corner and shunned from their main dinning area, the food may have lost its magic. I also noted  when I went to their bar, one of the servers (or more), may have been suffering of B.O. (body odor). Junoon: Please make sure that your servers neither have unpleasant smell or have over-powering cologne or perfume.It is quite disappointing to know that Junoon has a Michelin star, because it pales in comparison to their peers. Places like Cafe Boulud, or Bouley, both with one Michelin star do not deserve to be put in the same league as this restaurant.

I even visited during Restaurant Week and still managed to pay north of $200 for two. I honestly felt disgusted that I paid that much for what was served. Small portions all around.The main course included a side of rice and I swear it couldn't fill a newborn. How much does rice cost that they can't give a generous serving? Also most the food, especially the appetizers, were served at room temperature which is a sign that the food has been precooked and not to order. Plus, what's up with the B rating? To me its a bigger deal than most. But this place has a Michelin star and is extremely expensive! You're not embarrassed that you can't keep your restaurant clean? I know there can be different reasons for the deduction, but you have a chance to redeem yourself. I think it says a lot about a restaurant. The reason I gave them 2 stars and not 1 is because I did enjoy the service. The lamb dish was also very good. However, I will never be back to try it again.

I thought the chicken thighs were much better. The meat was juicy and the raita it came with was nice. We got the Kerala shrimp curry and laal mas (lamb curry) for our entrees. The Kerala shrimp curry was delicious! The curry was thick and creamy with the right amount of spiciness. It went well with the naan bread. I wish they had given more since my boyfriend ate it all! The lal maas was good but the curry was too thin. It paled in comparison to the shrimp curry.For dessert we had the passionfruit mousse and the rice pudding. The rice pudding was pretty standard. The passionfruit mousse was light and while good, it left much to be desired.Overall the meal was good.

The shrimp had a pungent smell and no it's not the variety of spices. The lamb shank was excellent except the portion was less than a quarter of a plate. The dark chocolate cake tasted like it was microwaved . Overall I was very disappointed save your money or go to tamarind , by far tamarind put this place to shame.",3,1,1,Kais S.,"FOREST HILLS, NY",9,69,5
4.0,2/14/2014,I really liked this place and was not that surprised to find out after eating that the place has a Michelin star. The sauces and spices were vibrant and complemented the chicken/naan very well. The open kitchen was a nice touch and high ceiling made the place feel very airy.

Our table was ready at the reservation time, staff was extremely courteous and helpful.It was out 10 wedding anniversary and we were treated appropriately.We started with cocktails. I had the Tandoori Tequila and my wife had the Adraki Punch. Both are highly recommended. Then Micheal (the bartender there) offered to make a scotch cocktail. This is not a menu item, but should absolutely be on it!!! My wife and I loved it.For appetizers we had the the Eggplant chat and Lotus Root Salad. The Eggplant chat should not be missed. The Lotus root salad was good too.For main course we ordered the Nandru Kofte and Brussels Sprouts with Junoon Paratha and Roti. Followed by the vegetable Biryani and Raita. Way too much food by our standards, but we could not get enough of the flavors this place has to offer.We ended with the Junoon Cheesecake and Cake with Green chili ice-cream.A true heaven for Indian food lovers!!!PS: 4-stars only because there was a small billing snafu that I had to call back to get resolved.

4.0,1/27/2014,"Michelin Star [X]Decor: Very tasteful.  Very low light, candles on every table, beautiful shadows cascading down the walls and floors.  Very relaxed, and not very loud.  This was an ideal place for a special occasion.  I felt very calm and content sitting on my personal couch by the candlelight.  Waitstaff: I felt like our waiter was only serving us.  He was incredibly attentive, knew  a ton about everything on the menu, and had great people skills.  He was very attentive without being too attentive though, which is a perfect balance.   One of our waiters accidentally dropped one of our forks off of the table and proceeded to apologize as though he had just accidentally dropped soup in my lap.  (I wonder if they make waiters stand in the corner and bow on cue like they do at Masa) I can't say enough good things about their service.  Food: The food was very high quality BUT was not truly Indian.  Many hallmarks of traditional Indian restaurants (I frequent Jackson Heights a lot) were missing, such as samosas. It is really American-Indian fusion, not true Indian dishes. That being said, it's still very tasty. I ordered the lamb and it was super tender and flavorful with just enough of the fat trimmed off the sides to not make it incredibly chewy or gamy but still flavorful and juicy.     The presentation, however, was light-years beyond what you'd get any almost any other Indian restaurant in NYC.  Every dish was arranged beautifully. Their cocktails are also noteworthy and delicious, if not the strongest.  You might not believe that a Tandoori Tequila sounds delicious, but it is!  Price: This is the only draw-back.  It came out to a little over 100 dollars per person (before drinks and tip), which is to be expected of a Michelin Star restaurant.  While the food and presentation was very good, you are really actually paying for the location and the decor.  It is more appearance than anything else.  This is a great place to take your out of town relatives/friends who want a ""fancy"" dinner or want to try ""ethnic"" cuisine without being forced to talk to someone who maybe doesn't have the best English or is going to serve you on a Styrofoam plate ( we all know a few!). Verdict:  Great service, good food, great decor, relaxing atmosphere, fairly steep prices, and a fresh spin on Indian cuisine.  You are paying for the ambience more than the food though and if you just want great Indian food without any decor or presentation you are better off going to dinner at your Bengali friend's parent's house.",0,0,0,C T.,"RIDGEWOOD, NY",0,15,0

4.0,1/18/2014,"Junoon has been on my list for quite sometime, I finally had a chance for my first lunch visit with my colleagues today.  Upon entering Junoon, I was impressed by the elegant lobby and a beautiful elongate hallway.  I immediately felt serene.  The hallway then leads to an open space of a main dining room and another private dining space.  Restaurant was pretty empty during lunch hours.  We went around 1:30PM and I was pleased about that, which means I won't have to wait too long for my lunch!  I knew exactly what I want before I came here and we all went with $25 Prix fixe lunch menu.Piri Piri Shrimp - was delicious, but nothing extraordinary.  Chili sauce had a slight spicy kick to it.  Shrimps were succulent and presentation was nice.Murg Lababdar - I was worried that it would be just a typical chicken tikka that you would get from a normal Indian restaurant.  But since this is a Michelin star restaurant, I had to try.  The dish definitely did not disappoint me.  Chicken was tender, I definitely wish there was more chicken!  That might be my only complaint, the portion was slightly small.  The sauce was rich, flavorful, and had a good hint of heat that made me going back for more bites as the heat intensity build up.  I really did enjoy every bite of it.  Rice Pudding - oh my! a highlight of my meal!  I usually don't care for rice pudding, but I didn't feel like having a raspberry mousse as my dessert.  I'm glad I went with the pudding.  It was so refreshing.  It served chilled with raisins and candied almonds sprinkled on top.  It wasn't sweet as I thought it would be.  Great texture balance between soft rice and crunchiness from the almonds.  I did try a bite of the raspberry mousse, it was also good, but I prefer rice pudding over it.Service - could have been better.  There was just a minor hiccup that I could overlook.  Our servers couldn't seem to remember what my colleague and I ordered.  As our food came out, they kept swapping my food with my colleague (all 3 courses).  Side note - Table size is quite large here.  If you decided to go on a date at Junoon, you might not feel as cozy as you might like it to be, but it definitely has a great ambiance and elegance interior space.",4,1,1,Kim S.,"Stamford, CT",206,235,454

He was so attentive that even when we went to sit at our table he would come back to see if we needed yet another drink...which we did. For apps we tried the piri-piri shrimp, they were delicious. Be careful though because it comes one for each person. We also tried the eggplant and the fluke sashimi, both were great! For mains we had the goat biryani, the lamb chops, and the spicy cauliflower. All three were amazing but the biryani won my heart.

I really liked he appetizer and dessert but not so much the entree. The lamb was really tough and hard to chew and the rice was jasmine rice which fell apart. The chicken for the appetizer was flavorful with spice and a kick of spicy. The rice dessert was not too sweet and very creamy. There was coconut chips in the dessert as well. It was a good experience. The servers were very prompt with the water refills and the wait for our food was fairly short.

They prove that Indian food does not need to be fiery hot to be delicious. The lamb boti kebab is my favorite dish. 3. It is a beautiful restaurant. Super elegant and perfect for anyone looking for Indian food with a classy touch. They recently redid the dessert menu which makes me happy. That used to be the only part I was not a fan of.

Chipotle chicken kebab was so good, it just melted in our mouth with its right amount of flavor and spiciness in the food. Onion kulcha was so soft and made a good combination with the Koftre we had. Veg biryani added another entertaining flavors to our entree. And finally , we called it a day with a pistachio cake , which was so delicious. Will be coming again for many more occasions to come. We definitely wish to taste the whole menu someday : ) Great food! Also, being Indian and tasting so many other kinds of food back home in fancy restaurants, Junoon just reminded me of home.

2.0,10/5/2013,"Pains me to do this as I have been here a few times and the food is very nice.  The good:  Classy touches include easy bar to table transfer of your pre dinner drinks.  They transfer the bill and carry the drinks over.  Also gave us a take out ticket to pick up our doggie bag (we over ordered a bit).  Food quality is very good overall.  Nice ambience both in the bar area and the main dining room.Unfortunately, the service is so inconsistent it kind of ruins it a bit.  Bar service was excellent and the bar tender was very gracious about helping to select a wine, giving us a taste of a couple. The tequila drink special was also very nice and unique.  Our waiter however was sub par and the kitchen has some issues with expediting order apparently.  The eggplant Chaat appetizer came to the table stone cold.  We asked if it was meant to be served this way as we were not familiar with the dsih and he brought a supposedly fresh one but it wasn't much warmer.  Tasty nonetheless but considering the high level of both prices and reputation, they should do better.  Service was agonizingly slow and we were both starving by the time the food arrived.  The Paneer Pakoras was ok but also not hot enough and a bit bland.  It is as if they were left standing too long.The entrees were excellent.  We had the Nadru Kofte, Masaledar Lamb Chops, Chicken Biryani and Spiced Naan.  We would have tried dessert but dinner took so long that it was almost 11 and we had to leave for another engagement.  This establishment is not cheap and strives to provide a high end experience.  I would not be as hard on it if it were not the case.  But for this price level, they need to raise the standards of the wait staff.  Another thing that seemed a bit off was the blatant attempts to increase the bill. The tasting menu was pushed pretty hard at first and they really pushed to sell more drinks as well.  The Lamb dish (the most expensive thing on the menu) was casually mentioned as a suggestion in answer to a completely different question.  Luckily it was very good ;-)The upshot is that the food is very good and you may have better luck with you waiter but with Tamarind and so many other outstanding alternatives I don't think I would spin the wheel to go back.",0,0,0,Alec G.,"Manhattan, NY",0,7,0

Prices are slightly higher as a result but the place has great decor and more importantly, very accommodating service for a pleasant experience. We ordered some food for the kid in our group and they served it promptly and perfectly spiced as requested. Our server gave us great recommendation for popular drinks and we liked the drinks we ordered. Food is good and breads are amazing, we tried onion kulcha and Hyderabadi chicken naan and a garlic naan. We started with Noorani Kababs which were alright, not used to combination of lamb and chicken but it's worth a try. Murgh Lababdar was good, but Lamb Kolhapuri was my favorite- spicy sauce and succulent lamb; also amazing was the Mirch ka salan, really hot and flavorful!Only disappointment was the dessert, we had ordered the 'seasonal trio of kulfi' which was actually bad in taste except one flavor!

We came in for Restaurant week to get the 3 course prix fixe, only to realize by the time we got there, that they do a $25 prix fixe lunch every day, not just during Restaurant Week. Nice!If Indian food is all about MAD FLAVORS, this place did not disappoint. I started off with the Piri Piri Shrimp, which was actually only 3 of them. But, tons of flavor to them; the chili sauce they use is amazing. For the main, we each got the Murg Lababdar, which by the way was soooo good. Another overly flavorful dish, that chicken tika was great, and we got ours with Naan, which I think was a good call. But in all honesty, I feel like you would do well with rice here too. Either one would work. For desert I got the passion fruit mousse, which was tangy but still very good. I don't like super sweet things so this was good for me. My friend got the rice pudding, and I had some and really enjoyed it. I can't say I'm a huge rice pudding person, so I'm not sure if that's what it's supposed to taste like, but whatever they served was good! I need to go back here, if for the chicken tikka alone!

The first was for restaurant week, the second was a groupon deal, and the third was a 30% off savored reservation. I have to say that the food is the same regardless of which deal you chose but with groupon you have to eat in the lounge which is not as nice as the dining room. The service - outstanding. Really attentive. Here is what I ate:Lahsooni Gobi - this was the crispy cauliflower appetizer. It was good, not greatEggplant Chat - this was outstanding. It even converted two eggplant haters. Crispy and great sauce. The last time I ordered it, it came out luke warm so specify that it should come out immediately after being made. Paneer Pakoras - nice homemade cheese. Not outstanding. Murg Tikka Mirza Hasnu (chicken thighs) - The chicken thighs were plain but cooked perfectly. the side salad was fantastic.Hydrabadi Chicken Korma - very nice. The sauce had a great flavorLamb Kolhapuri - this was not terribly interesting, the sauce was a little boring. Channa Pindi - chickpeas in a red sauce. uninteresting. Paneer aur Michi Ka Salan - Cheese in a tamarind sauce. Again could have used more flavor but the homemade cheese was very good. Naan - we got the garlic naan and the Junoon spiced naan.

However, the ""open"" kitchen is just too bright and doesn't really fit in with the rest of the theme. The ambient volume is also a little too high for a Michelin-starred restaurant.

3.0,8/19/2013,"Disappointed given the great reviews.Junoon does indeed have a lovely decor. But besides that, there is very little that is high-end Indian or creative about it.Went for lunch with a friend (picked Junoon over Tamarind, as we have both been wanting to try it).Appetizers: Piri-piri shrimp, Lahsooni gobiThe shrimp was a big let-down, especially after the server highly recommended it as a favorite. The sauce was a generic spicy tomato puree, and the avocado mousse did nothing to enhance the flavors (fusion for the sake of fusion is useless). Two pieces to a portion seemed a bit skimpy. The cauliflower was marginally better, but there was nothing ""lahsooni"" (garlicky) about it - it was batter-fried cauliflower soaked in a sweet & sour sauce, reminiscent of many Indian-Chinese restaurants at a third of Junoon's price point.Entrees: Lamb kolhapuri, Channa pindiI had high hopes for the lamb dish, described as simmered with toasted coconut, star anise, and white poppy seeds. I'm sure there was a little bit of all of those in it, but the flavors fell flat. The Channa pindi was even more of a let-down - there are more flavorful chickpeas to be had at *every* restaurant in Little India 4 blocks away.All in all, a great disappointment. I'll stick to Tamarind for the high-end Indian fix next time. Vikas Khanna should try eating there and then in Little India to remember what he's aspiring to.

4.0,8/14/2013,"It was everything I expected and more! Decor is dark, intimate and cozy, but still very nice. I came here for Restaurant Week for an early dinner at 6pm. It was mostly empty at that time, but as the night wore on, the restaurant became about 3/4 full around 7:30pm. Once you enter, immediately you notice the intimate setting with the lit up candle setting. There's a bar to the left of the entrance and straight ahead is the dining room. Since I ordered from the RW menu, my selection was limited, but the choices were interesting AND mostly importantly TASTY! For the appetizer, I had a chance to try the Murg Tikka Mirza Hasnu (chicken thighs) and Piri-piri Shrimp. The Murg Tikka was so tender and very moist. I literally could've put both whole pieces in my mouth and easily chewed thru both. There was a small smear of yoghurt sauce on the plate, which added to the moistness. The main thing I remembered about the Piri-piri shrimp was the spicyness! The shrimp might be lightly marinated with the chili sauce, but it literally lit a fire in my mouth! It's a good thing there is a blended avocado sauce on the plate to balance the heat, so warning, make sure to dip the shrimp in the sauce before devouring!For entree, I had the Murg Lababdar (chicken tikka) with rice. It was pretty typical of any (good) Indian restaurant I've ever been too. Honestly, it was no better or worse, but I will say it was a tad ""plainer"" than my favorite Indian restaurant Brick Lane Curry House. I also tried the Naan, which they give plenty of if you decide to go with the Naan instead of the rice as your carb. For dessert, I ordered the Passion Fruit Mousse. The dessert was a nice presentation on the plate and was very smooth. It was almost flan-like, but much much sweeter (in a fruity way).I also want to say that even though the dress code is dressy, I saw one table where the people were wearing shorts. Most of the restaurant was dressed in smart casual wear, where a nice shirt and pants would do. Overall, the restaurant was really nice, had ample seating and spacing and the service was very good. Food was not spectacular, but definitely worth trying for RW. P.S. One more note, the bathrooms downstairs have a nice little loungey area for patrons to chill in outside of them.

We met up during the week of Restaurant week. We each got a lunch restaurant week deal and a mango lassi.  App: Eggplant Chaat, Piri-piri Shrimpif you're in the mood for something less heavy because you know the entree is gonna be heavy, try this eggplant dish. you'll be surprised how an eggplant can be so good. def recomment. the shrimp dish comes out in 2 giant fat pieces that's very soft and well sauced. Entree: Murg Lababdar, Lamb KolhapuriI'm not Indian, so I'm not the best if to tell if the food is more authentic or fusion style. Junoon is probably more fusion and the curry sauces are less ""spiced"" and less heavy and less creamy. I thought the lamb was better than the chicken because the chicken sauce was not my taste. you can choose to get either naan or rice with an entree. We both chose naan, but we should've gotten one rice to diverse it. The naan was SO good but a little burnt :(Dessert: Passion Fruit MousseThe glaze on top was too sweet for me. The fruitiness made the sweetness even sweeter. After I tookd the glaze off, I was able to finish the whole dessert :) The mango lassi is the bomb. It's yogurty but not too creamy, and tastes like legit real mango is in there (I don't know how it is made). The decor is GORGEOUS. Junoon is definitely one of the most beautiful restaurants I've been to for sure. The service was great but I wish the waiter talked more and smiled. He was so dull.

Service here gets a 0/5 from me. The only redeeming quality about this restaurant was the food.  I got the chicken appetizer and it was pretty good - 4/5.  Some also ordered an eggplant appetizer which was delicious - 5/5.  Entree wise, I didn't find anything too special with how they prepared the food.  It was not worthy of the Michelin star that this restaurant got, in my opinion.

At first cut the decor hinted that maybe the food would be especially noteworthy. Unfortunately,  it wasn't...While the food is of a high quality, it does not encapsulate the diversity and range of truly great Indian food. The chef and his team have put together a noteworthy menu that clearly uses very high quality ingredients but does not truly release their flavors resulting in good food that could be much,much better. At this price point and with all the hoopla surrounding the chef and the restaurant I expected way more. Hoping that my first time there was a chance bad experience, I revisited the establishment only to walk away with exactly the same feelings as before.

4.0,6/24/2013,"Fine dining at it's best. Definitely upscale and high end. I went for my birthday with friends and had a great time. Junoon's décor is breathtaking without being over the top. It's quite fancy and elegant in design and ambiance. Open kitchen, love an open kitchen. It's nice to look over and see the people preparing your meal. Even the restroom area is remarkable, there's a beautiful display of spices that'll make you linger a bit longer from your table. The food was great, but my only reservation about returning would be the limited vegetarian options (I only had 2 to choose from). I don't eat any meat or dairy and would have liked if the vegetarian options didn't include yogurt-or at least had a non dairy option in place of the yogurt. But I digress, the waiter was very attentive, kind and accommodating. My friends did enjoy their meaty dishes so omnivores need not worry. Oh and for the wine lovers, there's an extensive wine list.Only thing that  tainted the night was the fire alarm that went off 3 times, yes 3 times. It startled me the 2nd time and caused me to spill my wine. Aside from that and the limited vegetarian/vegan options it was a nice night overall. Beautiful place.",0,0,1,Adi F.,"New York, NY",1,24,3
3.0,6/23/2013,"2 words - Sorely disappointed.1) Made an appt for 9pm - reached there 8:53pm. Maitre'd - Catherine said your table is ready, but wait 5 mins before we seat you. Ok, no biggie. (She is the one who booked our reservation, and was an utmost professional)2) Got showed our table. Low lighting, but nonetheless impressive ambiance.3) Waiter took our order. Were given the option of still or sparkling. chose still water.Be ware, it's $5 a bottle. We apparently had 5 of them. Didn't make sense. Everyone else was getting served by silver jugs. We were served by plastic bottles. And they wouldn't stay the same level as they were when they got done being filled. It'd be a full bottle whenever the waiter came by to fill our glasses up.5 bottles done by 3 adults and 2 children? Anyway, i'm nit picking here. 4) Mentioned this to the maitre'd as we were leaving. She agreed to it being weird. No apologies, no comp. She couldn't care less. Even in India, we at least get an apology or something. Anyways, -1 for that cr#p.5) The bill was a $123. They added a gratuity of 20% automatically. Made the total to $145. And then at the bottom of the bill, it says ""Gratuity not included"".Umm, WHAT?the nicest I can think of this scenario is - they added the gratuity by mistake and should've just mentioned gratuity of 15-20%.The worse I can think of this scenario - they already added gratuity, but want to trick ppl into thinking it's not been done. So that customers add a further 18%-20% on top of the bill.Such a classy place, the experience ruined our evening. It's not about the money. We spent over $1500 that day in times square shopping. It's the last $30 of the day, and how it got handled, that we spent the ride back and even at home discussing how off-track the scenarios seemed.It's the main reason I don't do fine dining, and I don't like to dine out. Such nickle-n-dime techniques. Will likely not come back here. I recommend the food. Keep an eye on your tab. ;)",2,1,1,MC H.,"Minneapolis, MN",9,40,1

The bill claimed that the original price for a dinner for two was $150, so we happily paid 20% tips based on that number. However, after I came home, I realized the original price of $150 was a bit inflated.

5.0,5/31/2013,"Amazingly good upscale Indian cuisine! I know I've been on an Indian kick lately, but this was too good to pass up.I bought a Groupon for Junoon and planned on using it during Book Expo. For me, Book Expo is a big deal, I enjoy it and celebrate. What better way to celebrate than going to such a great restaurant?I called in advance for a reservation, and they made sure to mention that the Groupon states you have to sit in the lounge area. Not a problem, I knew that.  They also called back the day before to confirm my reservation, which was nice.I asked a friend who works near Junoon to meet me for dinner. We both arrived a bit early and were courteously seated immediately on a comfortable settee. The Groupon said we could order 2 appetizers, 2 entrees, 2 glasses of house wine and 2 desserts.Our appetizers: I ordered Paneer Pakora. The cilantro-mint chutney served with it was great! It was delicately blended and the perfect complement. My friend ordered Murg Tikka Mirza Hansu, a wonderful dish of marinated chicken thighs. They were incredibly tender. We shared the appetizers and each had a glass of the white wine, which was very good.  We were treated to shot glasses with a watermelon drink. Very refreshing on such a hot day!For dinner my friend ordered Hydrabadi Chicken Korma. He meant to order the Lamb Korma, but was so focused on how delicious his other chicken dish had been, that he said chicken by mistake. He was not disappointed!  The cream sauce was delicious.I ordered Duck Tellicherry Pepper, an amazing smoked duck breast with a tellicherry peppercorn sauce. This was better than most duck that I've had in some of NYC's best French restaurants. I made sure to share it with my friend, and I am sorry I didn't save any to bring home to my husband. It was that good.We also ordered raita (truly well prepared and a very generous portion), naan (of course) and an extra glass of wine.We were full and debating the dessert, not expecting much in the way of choices. One doesn't usually go to an Indian restaurant for dessert. However, I am very glad we chose to have dessert! My friend chose the Lemon Crepe, which was served with macerated strawberries, a blue cheese streusel and ricotta ice cream. I had the Coconut Rice Pudding, which was garnished with ginger ice cream, bruleed bananas, dates, a rum glaze and candied almonds. Really, really nice and refreshing.We each had a coffee, too, and the chef sent out two dark chocolates with coconut filling, and two pieces of candied passionfruit. Service was excellent. They weren't obtrusive but still managed to make sure that everything was perfect. The groupon was 69, for 150 worth of food, and we spent an additional 40 for wine, 2 coffees, raita, and naan. Worth it. Definitely worth it. I liked the lounge area and didn't have a problem being there, so I would go back. I saw the dining room when I went to the ladies room and it was quite large. There were also a couple of private room for small groups.A great choice for a special night out.

3.0,5/31/2013,"I've been wanting to eat at Junoon for a while. Probably since I first saw Vikas Khanna - no not because of any accolades in the looks department but that was the first time I was ever made aware of an Indian restaurant with a Michelin star. Surely this place must be amazing right? I left thinking of the words of a famous poet ""if you had one shot, or one opportunity to seize everything you ever wanted in one moment would you capture it or just let it slip?"" Junoon let it slip.A groupon, a nearby credit card and a husband and I was set. The groupon can only be redeemed in the lounge which I had no problem with because I was gonna get to taste some of the most amazing Indian food in the city right? We were ushered into the lounge a few minutes after we got there, tables with varying heights, some too low and some way too low and we got one that was way too low. But amazing food is coming right? A child at the next too low table turned and coughed at my husband... Ok I'm starting to get annoyed - leave your kids at home! If they don't know how to behave and don't plan on trying then please let other people dine in peace. Everything will get better with a few sips of wine. That's all I got - a few sips. The server turned and looked back as if to say that was a very small serving but left it how it was with four sips in my glass maybe two fingers. Whatever I'm there for the food...right? I had the Noorani Kebab and hubby had the Piri-Piri Shrimp. The kebab was delicious and ingenious with the flavor of lamb wrapped by chicken and is one of those dishes that's meant to be dragged through the sauce on the plate and topped with some onions - just make sure your date eats them too. Hubby let me try some shrimp and it's all it's cracked up to be. A delicate spice but bold flavor in the sauce leave you wanting more. That's right, I am with the rest of the people who think there are too few shrimp in this dish. Maybe one more would be appropriate. For entree I chose to go with the Hydrabadi Chicken Korma thinking I will choose a classic and get a good POV on chef Khanna's vision of Indian cooking. The hubby opted for striped Bass Malvan. I was incredibly jealous of his food. The coconut curry was possibly one of the most perfect sauces I've ever tasted on a striped bass and it should be a requirement from now on haha. My korma left me sad though as I was expecting something sweet and instead had some nice, juicy pieces of chicken in a sauce that tasted more like a traditional curry and a touch salty. There was a pretty decent amount of rice and we ordered the signature Naan. I really don't care how modern or fusion anything is, I still don't think Gruyere has any place in Indian cuisine. Now what could have smoothed this whole thing out was dessert but it was in a word jejune. (I found that funny) Hubby ordered rice pudding which had ginger in it which for him is a huge no-no although I liked it. I had the trio of Kulfis - paan, mango and salted caramel. While it was refreshing it was not a dessert. The salted caramel was at best a nice flavored ice cream, although tasted more like what I expected with my korma than a salted caramel kulfi. Junoon had one shot, one opportunity. There was nothing particularly innovative about it. For even a Michelin rated restaurant I think the dessert could have been more exciting but instead I wished I was closer to Jackson Heights so I could gorge myself on malai sandwiches and hubby was whining for some sort of fancy version of gulab jamun. I was ok, not thrilled, dubious in my opinion of the meal that had just transpired - at a reduced price. At full price, I just don't know.",4,2,1,Meg A.,"Westchester County, NY",57,229,556

2.0,5/9/2013,"My family and I were excited to finally visit this restaurant after hearing about it and Vikas Khanna. Our Sunday lunch was not particularly bad but when we put the entire experience into perspective, it was truly not worth the visit. The lunch started strong with the eggplant chaat (light, crispy, innovative yet classic) and chicken thighs (succulent and juicy) but the lunch progressed into the mediocre range. We had the Junoon naan part of our appetizer which reminded me of melted cheese on pita bread. Tasty but not particularly special.Our party of five's main courses were: one vegetarian thali, one non-veg. thali, goat patiala, chicken lababdar. The thalis had a nice presentation but the vegetarian option cannot be justified for the price. $20 for a platter that has less than a quarter cup of chickpeas? An entire can of chickpeas hardly costs a dollar and we make them better at home. The paneer was a bit too spicy and the usual vegetable item was replaced with a punjabi daal. The thali comes with another daal as is so it wasn't the best replacement (they did it, we weren't allowed to choose I believe). My mother doesn't enjoy paneer but it's a bit disappointing when we asked for it mild that they couldn't accommodate our request.The non-veg. thali was a bit better for the cost and taste. No complaints with that one. We got the goat patiala and chicken lababdar entrees because we wanted to share and try other items on the menu. The goat was poorly spiced. There's no argument about it. The chicken fared better but nothing memorable. Naan and rice was the standard affair you would find in indian restaurants.For dessert we ordered one lassi, the coconut rice pudding, three kulfi scoops, and three sorbet scoops. The rice pudding was great, the other items were generic. Kulfi, sorbet, and lassi usually are similar tasting in most indian restaurants and don't ""wow.""I knocked off one star for price, another for taste, and the third comes from service. The service was helpful and pleasant as opposed to what I've read in the other Yelp comments. Everything came in a timely manner except for dessert. We had the wrong meat appetizer brought to our table at the start due to miscommunication but we thought we made it clear we wanted the chicken thighs. Our naan with the main courses didn't come out with them but that was addressed quick. Dessert was the worst part. It took longer than we would have thought and the waiter subbed in a different flavor of sorbet without even asking us which is completely odd to me. We would have declined it if we knew what it was going to be but we were given no such opportunity.Coming from an indian background and palate and have eaten at many other restaurants, I can certainly say Junoon did not leave a worthwhile impression. Between the price and average food, it's hard to justify coming back when you can find much better tasting indian food elsewhere for a fraction of the cost. It's a real disappointment too because I genuinely wanted to like the place but unfortunately that wasn't the case. At least the decor and ambiance were nice.",2,1,0,Niel P.,"Belleville, NJ",5,44,0

The spices and flavor are phenomenal though. I got the Lamb and didn't like it too much but the lentils were great.Also I heard the lunch is a better deal.

3.0,4/21/2013,"With such a great reputation, Junoon of course fulfills expectations in terms of pleasant/upscale atmosphere and great food. But even though the dishes were mostly winners, it's not a very unique experience in exchange for the steep prices - hence the 3 stars (more like 3.5, not quite 4).If you're looking for a nice experience with a sort of Western spin on Indian, this is the place for you. Tasty, quality Indian food is easily found elsewhere for less, so probably wouldn't go back for dinner. Maybe for the lunch prix fixe.The meal began with a spinach shooter - what tasted like a reconstructed chaat heavy on the yogurt and coriander. Simply yummy if you love those flavors. The paneer dishes included memorably soft paneer, even pillow-like. Choose the Paneer Aur Mirchi Ka Salan (entree) over the Paneer Pakoras (appetizer). The peppercorn spice jumped out in an almost clever way.  This is the one dish I would highly recommend. Piri-piri shrimp had a nice spice, but I wasn't blown away. Hydrabadi chicken korma was rich, nutty (more almond-like than cashew-like as the menu states), and would have been fantastic if the chicken itself was perfect. There were unfortunately some fatty portions. It was very, very tempting to overlook that though. Go straight for the Junoon Spiced Naan and skip the regular Naan. The spiced one was garlicky goodness with just enough gruyere to be interesting. The regular naan was, well, regular.Had the Spiced Chocolate Cake for dessert. Cake itself was dense and delicious. It came with a kulfi-style ice cream in a flavor that none of my party could quite identify. I don't remember what the menu claimed, but it seemed to involve hazelnuts and was okay. Head to Junoon with the intention to experience what is deserving of the Michelin star, not to tame a craving for deeply traditional Indian fare.",1,0,0,Pooja A.,"Morganville, NJ",17,11,0

I love Indian food and go to Indian restaurants whenever I get a chance, but this did not strike me as authentic. The food was Americanized, not at all spicy, which was disappointing, and the waiter didn't ask how spicy I wanted it, which is not typical of Indian restaurants at all.

3.0,4/11/2013,"Much like many of the other reviews, I was directed to Junoon via Groupon. My boyfriend and I went last night and I'm sorry to say that we didn't have quite as spectacular of an experience as some of the other Groupon users. The deal was for 2 glasses of wine, 2 appetizers, 2 entrees, and 2 desserts for $69 and, while that that does sound like an INCREDIBLE deal for a Michelin star restaurant, I have to admit that we left with a bit of a sour taste in our mouth -- none of which had anything to do with our menu selections.Let me begin with the disclaimer that I initially tried to book the reservation on OpenTable, but saw some information indicating that those with vouchers not issued via OpenTable could not sit in the main dining room, and would instead be seated in the lounge. To avoid any confusion, I called and made the reservation with the hostess. I alerted her that we had a Groupon and asked if we would need to request specific seating. She confirmed that it would not be necessary and that she had notated our reservation accordingly. The day prior to our reservation, I received a confirmation call from the hostess and noticed that she had written down the wrong time for our reservation. To her credit, she quickly modified the time and I confirmed.When we arrived, we were quickly seated in the main dining room and began discussing what we wanted to order. We had been seated for maybe 10-15 minutes when our server came around to ask what we wanted to order and I asked what the wine options were with our voucher. Almost immediately, she asked me to confirm that I had a groupon and told me that she would have to speak with the hostess, as we would likely need to move. She returned with the hostess and indicated that we would not be allowed to sit in the main dining room and were told that they, ""had a table ready for us in the lounge"". The hostess then passed us off to someone else and, very audibly, said, ""Just sit them anywhere...it doesn't matter.""Let it be known that there were MAYBE three other occupied tables in the main dining room (which had DOZENS available). We could not have felt more uprooted and uncomfortable. I can understand the specific restrictions on a normal basis, but we felt like they had absolutely no regard for Customer Service 101. Hardly any of the tables were filled and, yet, they found it necessary to make two patrons put down their waters, gather all of their things, and move to another room. My boyfriend told me that he felt as though we had just been ""moved to the back of the bus"" and I agreed. I understand the opposition of servers toward individuals with Groupons IF they feel that they wouldn't be appropriately tipped, or something of that nature, but we still left an overly-generous tip on the pre-discounted amount. Regardless, we felt that this was a shotty display of service from a Michelin star restaurant.Anyway, the food was good. Was it what I would expect from a Michelin star restaurant? Not quite. We had a decent Malbec and ordered:Piri-piri shrimpNoorani KebabKerala Lobster CurryLamb KohlapuriCoconut Rice PuddingSpiced Chocolate CakeI can't honestly say that the food would've been worth the original price point sans Groupon, but I do believe our service would've been much better had we not had it.

1.0,4/10/2013,"Apparently, there have been some changes at the restaurant that, in my opinion, are not good ones.  I have been to Junoon twice before my visit today and have found the food to be delicate, complex, and utterly inspiring.  This evening, my dinner was mediocre at best, unappetizing at worst.  My party and I ordered the 5 course tasting menu and started with an ""amuse bouche"" that was vile.  It was overwhelmingly spicy and set the wrong tone for the rest of the meal. In the past they seemed to warm up to gradually increasing levels of spice over the course of the tasting menu, which makes sense. Tonight each dish was more overwhelmingly spicy than the next.  We let them know how difficult they were to eat.  The waiter offered a side of yogurt to cool it down and said, ""yeah, your next 2 courses will be even MORE spicy.""  They said that they have intentionally gone for a more spicy menu, which is fine, but I think they should have offered to bring us different dishes for the remainder of the tasting menu rather than just more yogurt to cover up the unpalletable spiciness of the dishes.  They knew how uncomfortable we were and how little we were enjoying ourselves, which I don't think is right for a $350 check.  Not one accommodation was made except for more yoghurt.  It's a shame because this makes Junoon no better than my local Indian delivery restaurant that simply packs a lot of spice into some boring jasmine rice to give it a wallop of flavor that is not very sophisticated, nor pleasing to the appetite.",0,0,0,James E.,"Spring Valley, NY",0,4,0

The sauce is amazing!!!Entree- I asked for the least spicy vegetable curry dish, it's the nadru kofte, three pieces of Indian dumplings in tiny bit spicy sauce, it goes soooo well with rice.The lamb curry is more classic, but kind of salty.Dessert-  I had the banana tart, it's amazingly sweet.

The were well prepared and spiced, but lacked in presentation. The main course (hyderabad chicken korma and dal makhni) was good on taste but hugely disappointing as far as temperature is concerned.

The Groupon was excellent value - starter, main and dessert for two, as well as two glasses of wine! I was totally full by the time dessert came around. The meat (we had lamb and chicken) in the curry dishes was super tender and you could tell it was quality bits of meat - but to be fair, for the price you are paying (if you paid the full menu price), it had better be top quality!

It was great to go to a restaurant where they were actually interested in having you come back, even if you used a deal.We were seated in the lounge area (a requirement for the deal), which felt pretty intimate even with he bar behind us. The food was well worth the amount of money that was being charged for each dish. The vegetable seekh kabob was delicious, and the chana pindi and complimentary bread were both delicious and tasted very authentic. My friend ordered the scallops for the appetizer and a chicken dish and also found her food to be delicious and well worth the actual price of the dishes.

1.0,3/19/2013,"Summary: Go to Tamarind (Gramercy not Tribeca) for your high-end Indian. Horrible service ruins what might be passable indian fusion food if properly served. Decor is nice, but frustration with the waitstaff kills ambiance just as easily as bad interior design.Came here with 8 friends. Was the first to arrive at 8pm (reservation was 8:15pm), went to the bar to wait and ordered a drink (rye with crushed masala, decent whiskey with a twist, but not mindblowing). Spent the next 15 minutes drinking alone as the hostess neglected to mention to my friends (who had arrived minutes later and asked for the same name on the reservation) I was already here and the tall man next to me made it tough to see me from the entrance. Whole party was there by 8:15pm, we were seated at 9:20pm. We ordered wine, they incorrectly brought out a more expensive wine (turns out they were out of what we ordered). While they comped the difference in price and the person that tasted and accepted the bottle should have been paying more attention, still not expected at a Michelin starred place, and certainly made pairing wine with our first course hopeless.Amuse-bouche was a green pea/lime/cliantro/green chili chutney in a shot glass. My mother made better in her old blender. Appetizers were forgettable (honestly, i don't remember what I ordered). Had the duck for the main course, which was fatty and could have been good had it been served quickly enough to be warm when I ate it. Junoon naan was very good though, and I'm not usually a carb person. Also the first time I've seen rice be extra, but that surcharge is small compared to the check size.Come time to pay, they told us they could only take four credit cards, although we had specifically mentioned we would be splitting the check on cards and were assured it was all right. They would not budge on this topic, helpfully suggesting the location of the nearest ATM (it was snowing outside). Luckily, we were able to IOU and lend each other enough cash to figure it out, but this was absurd. I took a look at their payment processing system, it was a micros terminal, and I know the solution accepts multiple cards - they clearly were trying to avoid exchange fees. I guess that is proof that this place is run by actual Indians (food still isn't authentic though).Looking at other reviews, I am starting to understand why such a well reviewed fine dining restaurant needs to aggressively market through groupon deals. Service quality is not determined by intensity, none of the three waiters buzzing around our table helped out with the pain points of our experience, and I will actively recommend my family and friends to avoid this place.",0,0,0,K A.,"New York, NY",224,122,0

Menu is a la carte so all add-ons like naan and rice will cost extra, but portions are good for sharing.

3.0,3/19/2013,"I must say I have been waiting to go to Junoon for a while, since I have heard so much from so many people. It was my friends birthday lunch and we all went to Junoon on 3/17/2013. The place looked amazing on the inside and we were promptly seated. The staff was very friendly and nice. We took out time going through the menu and they had a lunch special which was $24 for a three course meal, there was also another special which was $38 for unlimited house cocktails, there was also a $19 thaali lunch. I and the birthday boy opted for the unlimited cocktails which was awesome. It was a ginger drink which felt like I was drinking a sprite with ginger and alcohol infused into it, it was extremely refreshing. We eventually ordered and then about 15-20 later our appetizers were served and they were all amazing every single one of them my chicken was cooked so delicately that it melted in your mouth. We then waited another 20 minutes or so for our main course. Everyone on my table was served except for one person who ordered the monk fish. While serving us they informed us that the monk fish would be out in 2 minutes. Some of the items served were extremely spicy I am usually fine with spicy since I am Indian, but this time we had a child with us who could not eat since the food was spicy. It had also been 15 minutes and the monk fish has still not been brought out and it was becoming more and more frustrating for everyone involved. While we were now trying to reach out to the staff waiting on us it looked like they were now avoiding us. Eventually I went and talked to the manager and that is when they said the food would be out a minute later and that actually took another 5 minutes. I would be fine with the whole situation if someone told me that they forgot the order and were making it. There was no such apology. The goat biryani was tasty but at the same time some of the rice was still a little raw and needed to be cooked more. the dessert was very interesting I had the kulfi which was cardamom and paan (beetle leaf), the paan was a very unique flavor and not everyone will like it, but the fig gateau was to die for.All in all the food was good and I would give this place 3.5 stars and not 3, but the service was not what I was expecting.

5.0,3/12/2013,"A Groupon, a frigid Wednesday night, and a hot date brought me to try Junoon. The Groupon was just for the lounge, but the menu was the same and there were no restrictions on what could be ordered. Even better: the cozy little couches promised us plenty of opportunity to ""accidentally"" touch each other without attracting too much attention---and, having been unable to meet for over a month, we were looking forward to plenty of that!I arrived first, opened the door, and was astonished at how HEAVY it was! I do 70 lb free weights 30 min every other day, so that tells you something. (If you want to show off, just open and hold the door!) Not only was my reservation ready, I had my pick of several seating arrangements. The couch it was. I got situated then went waaaaay to the back and down some stairs to the ladies' room...there were real candles on every stair!!! I'm a closet pyromaniac, so this thrilled me. Downstairs, the powder room (I think that's what those fancy outer restrooms are called) had a pretty spice display for decoration. Then the ""paper"" towels deserve their own paragraph. Textured like VERY soft, absorbent cotton, they had ""Junoon"" in gold letters. My first instinct was to wash it, wring it out, and hang it to dry, not throw it out. (I'm a peasant unused to these luxuries.)When I came back up my date had arrived. Thankfully, no one rushed us to order so we took our time with the two wines, two appetizers, two entrees, and two desserts. Our waitress was cheerful and polite; the busboys, swift and nearly unnoticeable (which is probably normal for fine dining but relatively new to me). We started with two glasses of Malbec, Lasoondi Gobi and Piri-Piri shrimp. Having been here before with spice-obsessed, non-vegetarian friends, my date recommended the shrimp...and I'm glad I listened! They arrived, perfectly cooked, lightly sauced in a nice piri piri, alongside citrus bits and a mandolined avocado. OOOH the flavor!!! Even living on the TX Gulf Coast I have never had shrimp as fresh tasting as those!!! The gobi my date ordered were just as amazing in their light breading and HOT garlicky glaze. Cauliflower manchurian is going to be anti- climactic from now on.No sooner had we eaten theses than an amuse bouche of spinach shorba ""shots"" appeared. WOW!! This made us both swoon. We definitely tasted cumin and maybe Himalayan salt.Our entrees were the Punjabi kadi and paneer aur mirchi ka salaan. The fig-shaped vegetable dumplings came topped with crisp dry lotus...and they were HOT!!! What a pleasant surprise! Paneer showed up in great soft slabs with lots of green chillies in that hot, creamy, peanutty sauce I came to love over a year ago---only Junoon did it better. Also, I LOVE when there's more sauce than rice, as was the case. My date begged to differ...but we sorted it out. For dessert we tried the kulfi trio and the coconut rice pudding. That amounted to perfect CUBES of cardamom, pomegranate, and paan flavored kulfi and the stated pudding with ginger ice cream, toasted almonds, dates and bananas (2 pieces each of the fruit-how convenient;)! Every bite was delicious. Cardamom and ginger flavors were INTENSE. But the coconut, paan, fruits, and pomegranate stood on their own as well.Then just after dessert and before we got the check, our waitress brought out two little passion fruit confections and two dark chocolate coconut squares ""compliments of the chef"". Wow. These were as intense as dessert, with the fruit candies SCREAMING passionfruit taste. As for the chocolates, MOVE OVER Russell Stover!! Dark chocolate and coconut cream flavors were on par with each other.What a dinner...hopefully there will be another Groupon or a higher paying job in my future!",5,4,3,Mary Z.,"Newark, NJ",205,179,13

I wish I could say I loved it, I even considered giving 3 stars, but it was just too difficult to rationalize it. We ordered the wine first when the server stopped by but she forgot that she asked us, so she asked us again when we got our appetizers what type of wine we wanted, and then we didn't get the wine until our entree. I ordered the scallops, the masaledar lamb chops, and the coconut rice pudding. My boyfriend ordered the shrimp, the mahi-mahi, and the chocolate cake.Appetizers:-Scallops were fine but it had pieces of shell that I unfortunately found out the hard way as I was chewing, the sauce was meant to be fennel but it tasted like straight up butter-Shrimp was seasoned well but was hard and chewy (aka overcooked)Entree:-Masaledar lamb chops had a weird crust...the spices that were encrusting the lamb were soggy so it left a weird texture in the mouth. The lamb was dry and the sauce tasted weirdly like the first one even though this was supposed to be with pomegranate. Also came with confit curry potatoes which I did not taste the curry at all and the potatoes were crunchy (aka undercooked). -Mahi Mahi was delicious, flakey, the crust was to die for. Didn't taste the sauce-Side serving of rice was on the greasy sideDessert:-Coconut rice pudding was overpowered by spices..I think it was cloves, and I couldn't even taste the coconut which was recognizable only by its texture. The ginger ice cream was overpowering as well, I felt like I was taking a bite out of a large piece of ginger. Rum dates were fine, I can't be objective because I don't like rum. The caramelized bananas had a good crust, but the banana did not taste ripe..it had that chalky mouthfeel.-Chocolate cake - Could it be called a cake or a hard piece of ganache? I had to hold my spoon cave man style to get a bite. Not sure what type of ice cream it was, but it was okay. I can't even really describe the taste of it either. The BEST part about this entire meal were the candies that came with the check. It was a dark chocolate filled with a mint creme and then a passion fruit jelly candy. The chocolate was melt in your mouth delicious, but the star of the night was the in house made passion fruit jelly candy. I felt schiested though..they literally took a bite size piece of jelly candy and cut it in half so my boyfriend and I got a half piece each. The service was not attentive and we had about 3 different servers. I don't think I'd even come back here if the groupon price was the actual price.",2,0,0,Isabella T.,"Manhattan, NY",86,55,30

5.0,3/3/2013,"When you find yourself gnawing at bones and eating with your hands in a Michelin starred restaurant, you know it's five-star food.  My boyfriend bought a Groupon for Junoon a while ago, and we finally got to enjoy its intimate lighting and decor this past weekend.  As other reviewers have noted, the Groupon diners get put in the lounge area with low tables that are somewhat awkward to eat off of.  This really did not influence my feeling about the restaurant, though, since I got to ogle the beautiful bar, and wonder if Ikea sold stuff that looked like the couches/tables/accents so I could make my apartment look just as cool and effortlessly lavish.  To start, we got the Piri Piri shrimp and the scallops.  Both were great--the shrimp was perfectly cooked in a tangy sauce, but the clear winner were the scallops.  If butter was a fish, it would be these scallops.  They were beautifully seared on one side, and cooked to perfection.  I could have eaten two orders of them, but I had my entree waiting for me!  I ordered the Chicken Poussin, and my boyfriend ordered the lamb kuhlrabi.  The chicken was amazing.  I don't even know what was in it, but the meat was tender and flavorful, with a fresh kick that kept me coming back for more.  The raita served under the chicken was also a great cooling counterpoint.  Aside from loving the flavor, I was pleasantly surprised at the portion size--I was essentially served an entire cornish game hen, cut into 4 pieces.  I tried to use a knife and fork to get the meat off, but I ended up picking the chicken up and eating it off the bone like I was at a bbq joint.  Kind of shameful and embarrassing, but so worth it.  My boyfriend's lamb was tasty and cooked in a spicy sauce, and he ate every bite!  We also ordered garlic naan on the side, which was good but kind of lacking in garlic.  Maybe I was wrong in expecting garlic-knot-level garlic, but still, it could have used more.  Finally for dessert we got the Indian ice cream sampler: pomegranate, palm leaf, and cardamom, and the rice pudding with ginger ice cream.  The pomegranate and cardamom were outstanding, but the palm leaf was a bit much for me.  It had a nice fresh taste at first, but then left a listerine-type flavor once you were done.  Kind of freaky.  The rice pudding was bangin', and that ginger ice cream was to die for.  Best Groupon ever?",2,1,1,Maeve C.,"Brooklyn, NY",198,331,2
4.0,3/3/2013,"Four instead of three stars due to the great service I received and the fact that I saved on my meal thanks to a Groupon deal. The groupon was for a 3-course meal for two including two glasses of wine for $65. A value of $130 or something like that.The restaurant is beautiful. The decor is warm, inviting and so elegant. I really enjoyed dining in this atmosphere even though we were only in the lounge/bar area. The lounge has couches with low coffee coffee tables so eating like this can get uncomfortable but we had no issues. The hostess and our servers were very friendly with menu suggestions and descriptions. At first they were attentive but as the time got later it was harder to find anyone to help us with refilling our water glasses or getting the check. They need more staff in the lounge area.For appetizers, we ordered the piri piri shrimp which was a burst of flavor! Also, I never tasted shrimp so succulent yet meaty. Also had the eggplant chaat which was tasty, especially the yogurt that came with it.For entrees, we ordered the tandoori poussin, tandoori chicken on bone with a light grapefruit taste. It was tender and the flavors surprising went well together. It was also a huge portion! I think it was half a chicken. We also ordered the lamb chops which was the star dish of the night. Best lamb I have eaten! Our dishes came with spiced naan and the rice. I really wanted to like the naan but I wanted more spice. It was pretty bland. The same goes for the rice.For dessert, we ordered the trio of kulfi and the chocolate creme brulee. The chocolate creme brulee was AMAZING! A girl's dream come true. The kulfi was light and tasty. I just wish they told me what the flavors were but by that point it was near impossible to flag down a server.Overall, Junoon made for a great date night but I have come to the conclusion that I prefer the more traditional Indian cuisine at my neighborhood's hole-in-the-wall Indian restaurant over this fancy Michelin starred restaurant.",0,0,0,Chris C.,"New York, NY",36,147,61

He didn't want to take an order for several appetizers at once but insisted that each guest go through what they wanted from appetizer to entree. Weird but the last straw was he rude and short-tempered about it. Food? Completely unmemorable. Spices were not cooked enough so they tasted sharp, uneven, and were hard to digest.

4.0,2/26/2013,"Junoon is the first upscale Indian restaurant I've gone to, so this was a bit of an interesting experience I had - as I'm a big fan of the standard Indian curries on their own. That said, we came here for dinner last week as we've walked by several times and have wanted to try it. It's very spacious, with both a nice front bar area, as well as a spacious main dining room. My only real complaint is that the lighting was pretty dim, almost to the point of having to strain my eyes a bit to see and read the menu (or I'm just old and my eyesight sucks). Service was pretty standard for an upper-end restaurant, with a rotating cast of waiters taking turns serving our courses and filling up our water.For our first time here, we decided to sample the tasting course, as I wanted to try different Indian foods that I hadn't had the opportunity to try before. First was lotus root done three ways, which was exceedingly good - the pureed version in particular has an almost hummus-like texture, but much livelier flavor given the hibiscus gel. Next was the saag paneer, which was just incredibly well-done - much better than at your average Indian restaurant, with very soft gnocchi paired with spicy - but not overly so - spinach. If I had to pick a weakest dish (along with dessert), it'd probably be the shrimp. I'm not a huge shrimp fan, and they do a very good job of cooking it with chiles and cilantro, but compared to the other dishes, it felt a bit off. The highlight of the dinner had to be the meat dishes, particularly the chicken wrapped within more chicken (poussin)...it's so meaty yet tender and delicious, and the coconut-based curry sauce really adds great flavor to the chicken. You are also provided with naan, which is very well-executed here...not overly buttery or puffy like at most Indian restaurants I've been to, and with a strong (but not too strong) garlic flavor. The lamb curry was extremely tender, although definitely on the spicier side (I was sweating a bit after finishing the curry). Of the desserts, I'd say I liked the fig date the best - it resembled something akin to a fruit brownie - but the others were not terribly memorable.In all, the food here is delicious, and I'd love to come back and try the a la carte menu to try different things out. That's not to say that I didn't enjoy the tasting menu, but I think there are plenty of other items to try that would be interesting. It definitely will set you back more than the new restaurants in Curry Hill (which is already relatively more expensive than your run-of-the-mill curry shop), but you definitely can taste the difference in quality.",1,0,0,Asuka N.,"New York, NY",371,1653,169

The shrimp dish we had was good, playfully sweet and spicy. The cauliflower starter reminded me of buffalo wings, good albeit a bit low brow.

4.0,2/8/2013,"Giving Junoon 4 stars instead of 3 because I was able to make it here for Restaurant Week so I was able to get the same meal for $38 instead of $60+. They started us off with a complimentary shot of soup which was a pleasant surprise. From what I thought I heard the server say, it was a warm curry potato soup. Pretty tasty. For my appetizer, I went with the Piri-Piri Shrimp (shrimp in a Goan chili sauce), with a side avocado-citrus salad. The shrimp was cooked perfectly and the salad helped balance out the intense spiciness of the chili sauce. For the main course, I chose the Lamb Kolhapuri, which was lamb in a spicy red curry. I was hesitant to order this at first because lamb can taste particularly gamy , but in the spirit of trying something new I went for it, and I'm glad I did. The meat was not gamy at all, probably because of all of the strong spices happening in the curry. It wasn't as spicy as I thought it might be, but it was still good. I can definitely see why this would be one of their most popular main dishes. The entrees also came with a side of naan and rice.. I was a big fan of their naan and to be real, I was a lot sad when the basket was empty..For dessert, I went with the rice pudding with almonds - pretty good. And when we got the check we got 2 chocolate truffles with a side of passion fruit candy. Cute.The restaurant is beautiful with modern decor and dim lighting. Good, attentive service.

This means we were sitting on couches and hunching over a table; or you would be sitting on a small table with very high chairs.  I suspected that all groupon buyers would sit there, because people that were dining around us were all using groupons.

Our hostess led us towards the end of the restaurant, passing the transparent red curtains and decorative paintings on the wall and seated us in front of the kitchen. We were NOT complaining at all especially when it was freezing outside. Heat + smell of delicious food = happy hungry camper. We each got different things so we can sample each other's food. Sharing is caring! Appetizers: LAHSOONI GOBI -Crispy cauliflower w chili flakes and garlic tomato chutney. This was a pleasant surprise. I mean, I liked veggies and all but this was the best appetizer we've tasted out of the 3. There was a nice crunch on the outside and the flavor had a nice subtle kick. Very good, highly recommend. Never knew cauliflower can taste this good.  MURG TIKKA MIRZA HASNU - Ck thighs in hung yoghurt, garam masala and cheddar cheese w chopped tomato salad. I didn't really remember much about this dish, but the tomato salad (aka 4 halves of cherry tomatos) were kinda good. PIRI-PIRI SHRIMP - Shrimp in goan chili sauce w avacado and citrus salad. Shrimp was cooked just right. Not over or under cooked at all. The spices were a little too powerful for me, but still good.  I would order this again just lower the spice notch a bit. Entree: Ck Tikka w rich sauce w tomato, onion and fenugreek - If any indian place can't get this right, they don't deserve to be in business. Junoon, you passed. Ck was tender and tasted just right.

The service from our primary waiter was subpar, but the support staff was excellent.Appetizers:The paneer pakoras were average. The cilantro-mint-yogurt chutney was disappointingly bland and uninteresting.The duck gushtaba was excellent. The saffron-almond cashew sauce was very well done, and mixed well with the green chile / mint in the meatballs.Entrees:Hydrabadi Chicken Korma - I love korma, and the spices in this were very lively. The poppy seeds gave it a really different taste than what I'm used to (even in non-'dive' Indian restaurants), and it everything was extremely fresh. Good if you like a creamy, peppery taste.Patiala Shahi Goat - if there is one thing I have learned: goat is consistently a great choice at good Asian restaurants. This was no exception. A very rich red sauce went well with the slow-cooked goat - like an Indian twist on good southern BBQ.Naan:I'm usually a believer in getting 'normal' naan, but I have to give a shout-out to the house spiced naan.

The lamb was so tender and flavorful. Chicken is also very moist and fresh. Would have liked traditional Indian desert options as well but the lemon crepe took me by surprise - out of this world. Also the dining experience and service was phenomenal. Warm and open environment is tough to find in Manhattan. I loved the copper serving dishes as well.

5.0,1/6/2013,"I found a great deal for this place through Groupon. $69 for 2 glasses of wine, 2 apps, 2 entrees and 2 dessert at a Michelin rated Indian restaurant? Yes, please! We arrived at this gorgeous, trendy and very classy spot on a Sunday evening and were seated in the lounge area, as stated on the Groupon, for our meal. It was stunning with large tables and comfortable couches lit by candles and dim lamps. Our waitress quickly came by with menus and asked what wines we would like. After ordering those we looked over the extensive menu where there were no restrictions except there was an extra $5 charge for lamb or lobster dishes, not bad. This is what we got: Apps:*Tandoori Pineapple Scallop. Possibly the most perfect scallops ever! So tender and mouthwatering, the seared scallops were served with a fennel and tandoori roasted pineapple sauce.*Duck Gushtaba. Tender, fresh green chile and mint ground duck meatballs simmered in a rich and sinful saffron almond and cashew sauce. *Naan. Excellent. Crisp charred top and fluffy throughout.Entrees:*Patiala Shahi Goat. Delicious slow cooked, tender goat in a rich and flavoful sauce of green chilies, tomato, yogurt and fresh cilantro.*Slow Braised Lamb Shank. Holy Moly! This massive hunk of lamb was cooked for 5 hours in a deep red stew of caramelized Onions, cloves, star anise and cardamom.  If there was no knife, I wouldnt have noticed. The meat fell off the bone when you cut it with a fork. Again, one of the best lamb dishes of my life! We took home more than half and had enough for 2 more meals. Dessert:*Coconut Rice Pudding. Very very good. Topped with bruleed bananas, dates, candied almonds and a rum glaze with a surprising side of ginger ice cream. When we got the bill, we were not charged the extra $5 for the lamb dish. Service was attentive, very nice and knowledgeable. The main dining room is absolutely stunning.

Come-on guys if you cook your omelet too thick and keep it on flame for long time, it burns the outer skin of omlette and leaves you with bad taste, its very basic on how to not prepare Indian omlettes. Indian masala omlettes are thin crispy, spicy with little garlic, ginger, corriander, onion and lemon jucie.Upma which it came with was also very mediocre quality. Vada Pav were so tiny it losses it appeal and doesn't taste like Bombay Vada pav.

It had a warm, community feel that even if you have your own table, it seemed like you were eating with other friends in the room.  My friend decided she'll have wine with her food and I went along with that, because when it comes to wine, I'm quite easily persuaded. :) I opted for the Thali platter, which according to the menu, is a trdition in India of serving guests with a variety of platters to sample"".  Somehow, the waitstaff correctly guessed that I would prefer the non-vegetarian option, which had:       Kerala shrimp curry - Handi or curry cooked in a clay pot by searing the           shrimp with coconut   milk, curry leaves, mustard seeds, green chilies and        smoked kodampuli.  The shrimp was perfectly done, it was firm to the bite         and yet not bone dry.      Murg Lababdar - Tawa, meaning cooked in cast iron by simmering chicken         tikka in a tomato and onion sauce flavored with fenugreek and ginger.  I could      have eaten this all day.  It was tender and flavorful as well as comforting due        to  the familiarity and the redolent richness of the tomatoes.  Too addicting!      Lamb Kolhapuri - Handi or clay pot simmered lamb in a spicy curry of red       chili,   toasted coconut, star anise and white poppy seeds.  This was an     earthy dish and to my mind is the East Indian version of lamb osso buco. My Thali platter was served in a copper serveware (see photo) with sides of yellow daal, raita, roti and rice.  I loved mixing my raita with the lamb and reveling in the spicy and cool contrast.   We ended the meal with brown butter banana tart which is bruleed bananas with gianduja cream and hazelnut craqueline.

5.0,12/20/2012,"Here's the thing. I knew the food at Junoon would be good. Everything I read, everything I heard... it just *had* to be. But given our experiences with haute cuisine in recent memory, I was a little worried that we'd end the night still hungry after having encountered pretty plates streaked with colorful sauces and 3 peas. I'm happy to report that this was not an evening of ""elf food"", and our experience left us more than sated.Having acquired a Groupon (awfully handy, those things!), the Mister and I made our way to the restaurant on a Tuesday evening, right around 6pm. We were actually early (weren't supposed to arrive 'til 7), but they were able to accommodate with a smile. We were seated at one of the little couches in the lounge, and greeted by our server (Leah), who gave us menus, took our Groupon number, and offered us our wine while we deliberated.We settled on:APPS - duck gushtaba (meatballs in kashmiri pepper, saffron, nutmeg, almond, and cashew sauce)  - piri-piri shrimp (goan shrimp, avocado, jicama, meyer lemon vinaigrette)ENTREES - chicken awadhi korma (chicken thighs in a sauce of almonds, caramelized onions, saffron, yoghurt) - lamb kolhapuri (cubed lamb with roasted coconut, poppy seeds, black pepper, red chili)ACCOMPANIMENTS - mint raita - garlic naanDESSERTS - date pudding cake (caramel, cranberry reduction, streusel, orange buttermilk ice cream) - coconut rice pudding (Red wine roasted figs, candied almonds, ginger ice cream, caramelized bananas)Leah made a point of commenting on pretty much every item we ordered, complimenting our picks and telling us what her favorites were/ what she usually tried to get a hold of from the kitchen when she could. The food came out quickly enough that we weren't anxious about it, but spaced out enough so that we really had time to enjoy each course. The service was warm and attentive (water always refreshed, etc.), but not overbearing. I probably don't have to tell you this, but the food was insanely good. Some of the highlights... - The duck meatballs are a must-get. They're unique and flavorful. They don't punch you in the nose with spice right up front, but rather take their time setting it up and pull the chair out from under you right as you're about to sit down. - The lamb was delicious and tender, with a nice kick. Just gamy enough to know it's lamb, but not overly so, to where someone who doesn't typically like lamb wouldn't enjoy it. - If you're a korma-lover, this korma is also a must-order. I seriously debated having them wrap the sauce and some naan for me to extend the pleasure at home. - The date cake must have been really good, because the Mister offered not a morsel. This was fine with me, however, as the coconut rice pudding (not as heavy as one might fear) and ginger ice cream (TO DIE FOR) kept me plenty occupied.Nice atmosphere, solid service, and great quality.

One bad side:  we had a groupon, which meant we could only dine in the lounge area, not the dining room, which was totally fine, but the table they sat us at was really uncomfortable. Not to sound nit-picky, but it was like the management never actually tried sitting at one of their own tables to dine. The chairs didn't match the table, and they couldn't actually fit under the table, so we felt like we were seated feet away from our food, which resulted in some totally clumsy eating.

Came here with a friend, and we were in food-heaven!For appetizers, we shared the eggplant chaat and the duck gushtaba (meatballs in saffron-almond-cashew sauce). Both were quite excellent. The meatballs are pretty intense, though. Not spicy, just...intense. Like, it become a bit of palate-overload if you don't have something else to break it up. The eggplant worked well to balance it. For entrees we shared the slow-cooked goat, and the okra. Again, both were excellent--particularly the goat. I had the house wine, which I think they said was a blend of zinfandel & merlot, maybe? It complemented the food quite nicely. Dessert! We split the date fig gateaux, which was downright orgasmic. Also got the seasonal trio of kulfi (""eggless ice cream""--flavors du jour were pumpkin, fig, and cardamom). I would seriously come back here just for dessert. We each got tea with our dessert--I got the darjeeling, because it makes for a good litmus test of tea quality at a restaurant. Their darjeeling definitely passed the test. Loose-leaf tea, brought out in a small teapot. There's definitely enough to share among 2+ people. Now, here's the weird part. My friend ordered the Chai tea, and when it came out it seemed...thin. Like it needed to steep longer. So we let it steep longer, and it never quite seemed ""right."" I finally opened it up and looked at the leaves, and realized it was actually made with GREEN tea, not black. In fact it looked like genmaicha (the green tea with the toasted rice).  So be forewarned that if you order the Chai tea, you're not going to get the usual robust black tea that's associated with chai here in the US. The atmosphere was nice. Very classy. Would make a great date place.

The best part of the meal was chana batura (chickpea curry) and the breads (paratha & poori), though I have to say that on average, I've gotten better breads at the cheap Indian joints.All in all, I am shocked at how easily the Michelin stars are awarded--I'd cook better Indian food with my eyes closed.

2.0,11/20/2012,"My husband and I have a strategy when it comes to dining out in New York City. One dinner is always devoted to an ""Ami restaurant,"" i.e. one that is vegan or very vegan-friendly. The other dinner (assuming we are there for two nights which always seems to be our standard stay) is at either a ""celebrity chef"" restaurant or a ""top 100 restaurant that may or may not be super vegan-friendly. This past trip's ""Ami"" restaurant was Candle 79, while the other, more trendy pick was Junoon, which according to my research, is the ""hottest"" Indian restaurant in the city right now. Of course, that's a fairly subjective assessment, but it certainly is getting a lot of attention currently. I have a feeling in NYC, restaurants are really popular for one minute, and not the next, but I guess Junoon is having a moment! I was starving by the time we rolled in for our 7:15 reservation. It boasted a gorgeous entryway, and the restaurant itself was very chic-spacious with just the right touch of Indian accents. Our first impression beyond just appearance was poor. We walked up to the host stand and informed them of our name and reservation time. They literally ignored us and talked amongst themselves for a full five minutes so we were not sure if we were sort of put on hold or actually being addressed. Then, one of the hosts walked away-he got a good ten feet away from us before he turned around to see if we were following. In other words, there were no verbal cues or even gestures to indicate we should follow. He was quite unfriendly to say the least. Once we were seated, we actually ordered right away since we were starving. We started with the eggplant chaat- thinly sliced crispy eggplant seasoned with chaat spices and tamarind sauce. I asked also that the yogurt be left off, at which point the waiter asked if I was vegan. Major points for that! I said yes, and told him I was gluten-free also. He told me he would ensure my dishes would meet those restrictions, and even told me that the eggplant was dusted in wheat flour, so he would make sure they did not do that to my order. In the interim, we were brough little shots of a warm Indian lentil daal- the soup was delicious and just like my mom's! Our eggplant app came out right away. First impression-it was tiny! Like the smallest appetizer I may have ever received at a restaurant tiny! All it consisted of was thin slices of baby eggplant with some seasonings on top. I took a bite and realized something else...there was yogurt on it! Just so you know, the restaurant was really dark, and I had trouble seeing all of my food. I should have really looked before I took a bite, but silly me, I didn't. Our waiter came over a few seconds later and immediately noticed the mistake. He apologized and said another would come out sans yogurt right away. For having had an explicit conversation about my veganism, that was such a fail! Another one came out soon after, and my husband kindly let me eat the whole thing since he knew I was seriously starving at this point! He's not much of an eggplant fan to begin with. For dinner, I ordered a cauliflower and spinach dish that was already vegan and tasted amazing. Again-it was just like a spicy cauliflower dish my mom makes, which had me wondering if the executive chef and my mom are from the same region in India... I also ordered red Bhutanese rice to accompany my entrée, which was an awesome and unusual rice option. I really enjoyed my entrée and ate the whole thing! Just as a side note, my husband ordered their version of chicken tikka masala and was not impressed. We skipped on dessert, but I noticed that they were giving all tables complimentary dark chocolate to enjoy. However, because I was vegan, our waiter brought us some little apricot ""pates de fruits,"" which are basically jelly candies. Let's think about this for a minute. Almost any jelly candy I know of has gelatin in it, which is far from vegan. Oftentimes though, dark chocolate is vegan. Not that I am sure this particular restaurant's dark chocolate was vegan or not, but it seems to me that dark chocolate is more likely to be vegan than jellied candy, right? I even googled the ingredients of pates de fruits, and it was pretty clear gelatin is a star ingredient! I know our waiter meant well, but to me, that's another fail for sure!

We spilt a drink, and when I flagged the Maitre'd and said that a drink was spilt, he said ok and walked away with no action.  Had to flag our server who did the right things such as offer another drink, cleaned the table and laid out another napkin to ensure we did not get wet.The appetizer Noorini Kabob was very good, but the Piri Piri shrimp's marinade was a little undercooked or rather did not all come together yet.  No explanation that the jicama and avocado was not part of the final product but just pickled and on the side.For the main course we had The Lobster Tandoori, Patiala Shahi Ghosht, lotus Root Kofta, and Roti.  The Lobster was ok, a little too dry for my taste.  The Lotus Root Kofta was good and the Lamb was pretty good.  I do think the chef is holding back from truly expressing himself authentically and rather is kowtowing to an assumed presumption of fine dining (french).  After having said that, the food is quite good, but pretty standard.A food rate of 3.5 and service of 2.5 makes it a 3 star place.  I do wish the chef would let loose as it is evident that he is very good at his craft.",0,0,0,Rajiv I.,"Los Angeles, CA",25,96,12

One is alot more intimate, with couches, and the other is more grandiose, with large columns.

And I mean its VERY pretty.The servers seem like nice people. They were nice to us at least. Unfortunately they have no idea how to be servers. Also about 9 different people served us throughout the meal, which was weird. I also thought it was weird that when I asked where the bathroom was, the one guy felt the need to follow me all the way throughout the huge restaurant to make sure I made it into the doorway. Whatever.Its overpriced. I mean the ambiance is nice, though we were seated near a birthday party that was loud as all get out, and it was just a table for 2 for us.The food sucks. I mean its not terrible for murray hill, but it sucks for the price. Waiters were obsessively refolding my freakin napkin for me whenever I used it. I had to ask them to stop doing it twice, but to no avail as it was a different person every time! The 3 different waiters who took our order couldnt understand english - and look I have no problem with anyone from a foreign culture - but Id like to be able to order my food, thats all. Food was bland and boring and dishes had overwhelming amounts of cheaper ingredients and little of whatever the main part of the dish was. Wines were crappy, we just settled on the second one we tried cuz it was TAKING FOREVER TO GET ANYTHING DONE.Amazing though,. how the waitstaff wouldnt STOP FILLING MY WATER GLASS. It was like every 2 seconds someone was buzzing around my shoulder, filling the glass, or folding my napkin, or cleaning some crumb off the table.Then I guess they tried to do some sexy lighting in our room, and basically turned the lights off? Was so hard to see. Then, naturally, we got abandoned once we told them we wanted our check. I had to ask 4 different people for my check, and it never came. We endedup going out to the front desk and demanding our check or we were skipping the bill. It literally took like a full hour just to get the check, not including the extremely unreasonable amount of time to get the boring dull food.So even in that huge wait for the check, they still came and buzzed around me and fiddled with my napkins and water glass and straightened things out that were already straight, it was maddening. But no check...My best friend of a decade is Marathi, from Pune. Trust me, Ive experience a lot of Indian food through him.

4.0,11/4/2012,"The food here is very interesting, and yet I am not sure I will return soon. I really loved the flavors of the carrot soup and the lobster (the latter was tandoori-style, smoky, and accompanied by interesting nuts and fruit). My companion had one of the lamb dishes, which was okay but not amazing, and the scallop pineapple appetizer, which he really enjoyed. What makes me a bit underwhelmed about the experience is that the restaurant engages in a level of nickel-and-diming that is a bit embarrassing for an establishment of that level. There is an extra charge for rice (at an Indian restaurant? really? I've only ever seen one other, much cheaper place do that and found it awkward then as well). The mango lassi comes in a wine glass that is about 60% full and costs $8. Raita, to cool down the flavor from the spicier dishes, is $6 extra. Yeah... Also, while the carrot soup, as mention, tasted great, I have never gotten such a small serving of soup at a restaurant of any level. Imagine the volume that fits into a fairly small coffee cup. So while the food was good and the service was perfectly nice, the restaurant conveys a stingy, over-priced image that makes me reluctant to recommend it wholeheartedly to anyone but the wealthiest customers.",0,0,0,Irina M.,"New York, NY",8,148,0

Which is really a basic thing to do.When we told the waitress about how spicy were the dishes that they said were not or really slightly spicy they said that it's an indian restaurant so they can't really make it not spicy.

3.0,10/1/2012,"As one of the many people that get multiple Groupon/Living Social deals per day, I was pleased when I saw a Groupon for Junoon.  In my quest to visit every 2012 Michelin Star restaurant in the country, I quickly purchased that coupon and made a reservation.  We started with the tandoori pineapple scallop, which was seared with fennel puree and tandoori-roasted pineapple sauce.  The puree was delicious and the scallop was cooked to perfection.  We also had the murg tikka mirza hasnu, chicken thighs marinated in hung yogurt, junoon garam masala, and cheddar cheese.  the chicken was very tender and the marinade was creamy and filled with spices.  Not as good as the scallop but still solid.  For our entrees, I had the wild striped bass malvan, which was seared with a coconut, green chiles, and cilantro sauce, and my girlfriend had the patiala shahi goat, which was slow cooked in a sauce of green chiles, tomato, yogurt and cilantro.  My fish was the smallest portion of fish I've ever had at a restaurant, and while it was cooked well, the sauce was fairly simple and nothing to go nuts about.  The goat was a better-sized portion, but the sauce again tasted like other cilantro sauces I've had.  Pretty unimpressive considering both costed over $30 and didn't include any sides like rice or naan (which were $6 each).  We also had two glasses of Sauvignon Blanc with the meal, which paired well with the food.  For dessert, I had chocolate hazelnut gateau with brandied cherries, feuillentine bark, chocolate caramel soil, and espresso ice cream.  Very different and had a consistency like fresh cocoa rather than a creamy chocolate, though it could have used a few more brandied cherries.  My girlfriend had the coconut rice pudding, which was good but nothing that memorable.  When we first arrived, the hostess and the waiters were very nice and attentive.  We really enjoyed the decor, which had an traditional Indian feel but still looked trendy and cool.  Our servers and waitresses were helpful until the very end when we wanted to get our check.  We waited for over 30 minutes after we finished everything, and there wasn't a waitress in sight.  We finally got the attention of a waitress from a different table and were able to pay.  All in all, I was fairly disappointed with the meal.  There were parts of the meal that were excellent but other parts that were very simple and didn't meet my expectations.  The service was hospitable at certain points of the meal, and non-existent at other points.  Overall a very inconsistent experience, and when I consider how expensive the meal was, I will not be returning to Junoon.",5,0,0,Kevin M.,"New York, NY",25,100,0

Secondly I apologize for the long review.Decor: 4/5-The restaurant is lovely inside. We sat in the lounge which was a bit odd bc the attire was suppose to be formal but we saw people in t-shirtsService: 1/5-I came here with Yelpers Hans H. and Kenny C.-Service started okay, got worse and didn't improve too much at the end.-I found a piece of 7 inch dark hair in one of the entrees. The manager tried to correct it but I told him not to compensate me in any way though I was disappointed that a Michelin 1-star restaurant would allow this to happen-The manager ended up giving us 2 additional desserts-I felt like our table was ignored until the hair incident and found it amusing that the manager ended up being our server for the rest of the night.

Highly recommend this-Piri-piri shrimp came in 3 large pieces smothered with the chili sauce.

The cream sauce was great.-Slow-braised lamb shank was offered boned or deboned. Plenty of tender meat that falls off the bone though the sauce was a bit heavy.Dessert: 3/5-Seasonal Trio of Kulfi consisted of Cardamom, Strawberry and Mango. Cardamom was the best and tasted similar to Earl Grey. Strawberry was the next best followed by a disappointing mango that didn't even taste like mango -Date Fig Gateau was moist but okay. The cinnamon ice cream with peppercorn was the best part-Chocolate Creme brûlée with Pomegrante ice cream was extremely rich. Think of a chocolate explosion in your mouth.

On the way down to the restroom, they have this spice room where they display a lot of different spices. It's really cool and def worth checking out if you're dining here. Everything that I had was amazing so it would be hard pressed to pick a favorite. Patiala Shahi Goat - The goat was slow-cooked so it was incredibly tender and and it had the perfect amount of fattiness to it. The sauce was tomato and yogurt based. It had great thick texture, and the green chilies gave it a really nice kick. Murg Lababdar - This chicken tikka dish was a lot more complex than I expected. It tasted like they grilled the chicken first so it had this beautiful smokey taste that went really well with the sweetness of the tomato and onion sauce. I was also expecting this to be really heavy like most chicken tikka dishes but it had a surprising lightness to it. Nadru Kofte - These lotus root dumplings were phenomenal and a great choice if you're looking for something a bit more unusual. It's a really beautifully prepared dish and includes the lotus in three different ways. They take the lotus, boil it, and them shape it with cheese into sort of  like elongated ball. Then they coat the ball with a batter that includes lotus. And finally there are thinly sliced lotus chips on top of each dumpling. It has the texture of potato and the slight sweetness reminded me of taro. The sauce is made of fennel, fenugreek, and cream.

3.0,9/10/2012,"It is hard for me to review Junoon.  I've been here twice, and both times it has completely exceeded my expectations in some areas, and it has also been a tremendous letdown in others.On a positive note.  The space is amazing.. from the entry, to the lounge area, the walkway to the dining area, the open kitchen, the private dining room to the site, and most amazing of all, the lower level that contains the spice room.Service has also been exceptional both times.Food is where it seems to hit or miss, and for me, that is paramount.  The first time we were there, my wife ordered the junoon version of sheek kebabs...  the plate came out, and it contained two long kebabs, and nothing else.That same time, i ordered a bass dish for my main course...  but there was no way to make a meal out of it.  It was the fish and some sauce... no starches, not vegetables with it... now, if you go traditional indian... then it should not be an entree portion of fish... it should be something you share.  if you go non traditional, then it should be presented as a full entree, not just a piece of fish.When we were there yesterday, we ordered the eggplant chaat appetizer and the chicken appetizer.  The flavors of both were amazing, and some of the best cooked food i have had.  The chicken was perfect, charred on the tips, tender inside.My wife ordered the lamb chops for her entree, and she said it was by far the best lamb chops she has had in years.  The portion was a good size, and the flavor amazing.  i ordered the shrimp dish... it was good, but nothing out of the ordinary.  We also ordered the dal makhni, rice and roti to go with our meal.  All three were good.For me on the milder side, but decent flavor none the less.As part of the groupon deal, we also received some desert with our meal... i asked for a fruit plate as a substitute, and my wife ordered the trio of kulfis.  She enjoyed the cardamom one... but isn't too much of a fruit desert fan.. so the other two flavors (mango and strawberry) were not to her taste.  My fruit plate... unfortunately was a sorry excuse for a plate.  it contained one strawberry, about 10 blueberries and probably a quarter portion of a small peach.  No garnish, no presentation..... and was somewhat disappointing.if you want service and a great ambiance, this is the place to go... unfortunately, for the prices they charge, i would look elsewhere.",3,1,0,Asish P.,"Jersey City, NJ",84,442,2562

The only limitations on the groupon were for a lamb dish, something about an appetizer and that the alcohol could not be discounted more than 50% (the ""value"" of the groupon was listed as $150). We were disappointed that the restaurant gave us trouble about the alcohol and told us we could only pick from two wines which weren't even on the menu (as opposed to what the groupon stated) - any other wine on the menu would be an additional surcharge (even though it was just a $14 glass). We informed them that this wasn't as advertised and after a big discussion, they did us the huge favor of making "" a special exception"" for us (as in honoring what they were advertising in the groupon!). It created a big ordeal out of what could have otherwise have been a pleasant evening. The waitress then kept smiling oddly at someone behind us (the manager?) every time she served us, which made us feel all the more uncomfortable. We ordered the gobi appetizer which was delicious as we had just driven over from the hamptons and were famished.  Everything else was quite ""meh"" after that.  The food was creamy and ok in terms of texture but weak in terms of flavor (I like my food tangy!).  I guess my tastebuds are used to a more tantalizing experience and what they got was either too much cream or too much cornstarch.

I've left one star off because overall I felt the meal and cocktails were a teensy bit pricey, but maybe that's me being overly picky.  Overall, we left very satisfied with our experience and already making plans to come back.  Run, don't walk to Junoon!",0,0,0,Tash P.,"New York, NY",8,61,0

4.0,8/28/2012,"** 4.5 stars **Junoon serves some of the best Indian food I've ever had, upscale or downscale, although I'll be the first to admit I'm no expert.  This is only the second upscale Indian I've dined at, after Tamarind Tribeca, but Junoon leaves the latter far in the dust in every aspect of a dining experience.Junoon is an ultra-modern white tablecloth restaurant, handsome and refined, but most of the large main dining room is rather generic and does not suggest Indian.  Instead, their street-facing lounge, where we settled in briefly before the restaurant opened, mingled the predominant contemporary look with old-world touches, including silk rolled cushions and worn wood seating.  We started with some Indian spice-inflected cocktails, decent but not craft cocktail level, before the hostess came to fetch us for seating.From the main dining room, the kitchen can be seen through an open window.  On one side is a pretty walkway separating some semi-private dining areas.  Our seats in a curved high-back banquette were cozy, roomy, and very comfortable, felt like a nook and was far enough from other tables to feel private.Service here ranged from good at the front to excellent table-side.  Our waiter was attentive and enthusiastic, and support staff were quick to clean and refill.  We were well-taken care of yet not overly fussed over, and the service was friendly enough to never feel too formal.Their very appealing menu includes two tasting courses (4 or 6), which requires all to participate; the full menus for these are available for perusal.  Our party elected for a la carte dining, which was difficult enough to make choices for.  Sometimes I am enamored with a restaurant simply by reading their menu; Junoon is such a place.  Almost everything appealed to me but with three diners, that's not happening.After a refreshing sip of gazpacho as amuse bouche, we shared a round of five appetizers.  Most are sized just right for 2 - 4 to share.  The five arrived together, then began what would be the hallmark for the evening: at every bite, someone says ""This is the best ___ I've ever had, you have to try this.""  So it went with our savory paneer pakora, plump tandoori pineapple scallops, intensely spiced piri-piri shrimp, tender duck gushtaba meatballs, and crispy eggplant chaat.  Every dish had distinct spices, accompaniments, textures, and flavors, layered and interesting, ingredients fresh and well-cooked.  All appealingly plated and plain delicious.  We were ecstatic.We broke for some garlic naan, lovely, bumpy, and fragrant bread with charred edges, dipped into a deeply flavorful yellow daal tadka.  Although the daal has chilis, I didn't consider it spicy.  Heat is not emphasized at Junoon; if you can't tolerate it, you'll probably find something too spicy; if you can take it, you'll probably find nothing spicy.  For my part, heat would be the perfect last piece for some dishes but with everything so tasty, I can overlook it.At this point, one dining companion looking for a non-alcoholic drink ordered a mango lassi; their lassi selection is actually on the dessert menu.  After she tried it, I asked how it was and her hilarious deadpan response was ""The best mango lassi I've ever had, what else?"" before handing it over to me to try.  What else indeed?  (yes, it was quite good).The entrees at Junoon are prepared in one of five traditional styles: Tandoor, Sigri, Handi, Tawa, and Patthar.  Although there were weak attempts to select three entrees with distinct preparations, we gave that up since I was already sure during the ordering process that I'd return (yes, based on the appeal of the menu alone).The tandoori marinated lamb chop was blissful, the best tandoori-cooked item I ever ate.  Perhaps I've been deprived.  But such melting tenderness married with rich, layered flavors singing in every bite.  It was beautiful to see, sublime to eat, the bit of brown butter sauce swirled artfully around it could be an afterthought but actually counters the flavor well.  The Kesari Murg Kebab, richly marinated chicken thighs, were wonderful, smooth and tender with a bit of char, great flavor of yogurt, saffron, and almond.  Finally the gigantic hunk of slow-braised lamb shank, which alone arrived without accompaniment as though to emphasize its size, was very well-done braised meat.Desserts are not particular Indian-leaning, so we just shared a simple but very good coconut rice pudding accompanied by bruleed bananas, dates, candied almonds, and a scoop of spiced ginger ice cream.  A perfect sweet ending.Junoon was one of the best eating experiences I've had in 2012, the food is simply extraordinary and I will return soon.  The ambience is not unique, but it is very comfortable.  Service was excellent.  Reservations for Junoon are easy to come by, and I only fear that insufficient interest in this restaurant will not allow it to survive, a loss if that were to happen.",1,0,0,Valery C.,"Forest Hills, NY",56,837,9616

Enter Junoon and you are simply blown away by it.  The huge pillars  (I think they call it Junoon walk) in the front remind you of an Indian palace. There is this Indian swing (called Jhoola) which gives the old Mughal India look to it.What made this place unique is that right when I looked at the menu, I noticed that Junoon is not like the typical Indian restaurant that is divided by the region of cooking where it comes from. It stands out completely as it divides itself by the different styles of cooking. You got the curry (handi), stone cooking (patthar) and many other options to select from.  My mother being a foodie, also joined in and mentioned that she loved the fact that the spacing between the tables in good enough to ensure that the guests can have their own space without listening in to what other's are talking about (once again something which is very common in other restaurants)The piri piri shrimp was my personal favorite and the trio of kulfi (another signature Indian thing) in the desserts were the best.Overall, a must try for the locals and specially for travelers looking to soak in a complete Indian dining experience.",0,0,0,Paarth S.,"Weehawken, NJ",0,5,5

But I'd recommend to forget about the apps and really just move on to the entree curries: we had the coconut shrimp and the lamb and they were both excellent. The naan, rice, and aloo paratha were simply perfect to lap up the curry sauce. And the black daal we had on the side was spot on.

5.0,8/7/2012,"Opulence seems to be what architect Tarik Currimbhoy had in mind when he designed Junoon. The façade of a basket-weave sculpture was quarried in India and chiseled by hand. It gives a visitor a sense of the grandeur that awaits him upon entry. That façade leads into the 'Junoon Walk', a beautiful walkway with a reflecting pool center piece and 'tree of life' sculptures. The walkway demarcates the 45-seat private dining room from the main dining room that can seat 100 people. Yes, this is a palatial restaurant for Manhattan standards. And I've yet to mention the gorgeously decorated 50-seat lounge where there are 2 beautiful antique Indian swings made of hand-carved Burma teak. And downstairs is a spice room where you can take a peek at the spices and herbs that go into their dishes. Indeed, it seems that no expense was spared in designing and decorating this fine dining Indian restaurant. Once seated under the soft warm lights of the dining room you'll quickly notice that the service here is as elegant as your surroundings. Crisp linen covers the table, dishes are served on fine China, the silver gleams with polish, and the sommelier ceremoniously pours wine from linen-covered wine carts. Servers are clad in a dark uniform, almost as if to aid in their unobtrusive presence. But their manner is warm, welcoming, and quite friendly. Service is on point and attentive but not overwhelming. And even during Restaurant Week, when other restaurants' staff tends to be less than friendly, service was faultless.And of course there is the food. The executive chef is Vikas Khanna who is known for his work with Salaam Bombay and on the media. And the chef de cuisine is Walter D'Rozario, a Calcutta native who has headed the kitchens of Devi and Salaam Bombay. Together they have crafted a menu that highlights the glories of Indian regional cooking and yet made somewhat familiar to the Western diner by means of a more Western presentation. As expected from new restaurants of late, they strive to use local, sustainable, and organic ingredients as much as possible. Menu items are labeled according to the five elements of Indian cooking: Handi or pot cooking, Sigri or open fire pit, Pathar or stone cooking, Tawa or cast iron cooking, and Tandoor or clay oven. The spices are ground and mixed daily and that delicious and mouth-watering aroma that accompanies Indian cooking wafts into the dining room through the semi-open kitchen. For appetizers the Piri-Piri shrimp will perk up your appetite with its Goan chili and vegetable options such as the eggplant chaat are highly recommended. For the entrees the goat and lamb curries are excellent and familiar dishes is presented with the chef's unique touch. Tandoori comes in the form of lobster tails, halibut, and lamb chops. And do not underestimate the vegetarian dishes. And for dessert, the seasonal trio of kulfi or ice cream has been much written about since Junoon's opening. A 4-course tasting menu is available for $65 and 6-courses for $85 at dinner. For lunch there is a 3-course prix fixe for $24 as well as a Thali platter available. And since dinner prices are a bit steep Junoon might be best visited for lunch. Of course, when you consider that this is a Michelin-starred restaurant and when you revel with the refinement and luxury that accompanies such a distinction then you'll likely find the price tag worth the occasional expense.The RW menu is extended until 09/03/12!

In fact, when meeting potential friends, if I find their birthdays are separated by a distance that makes the advantage of amalgamated celebration impossible, I autosort them into the 'acquaintance' file. Anyway, Junoon, not to be confused with a mediocre 90's film starring Robin Williams and an enchanted board game, means 'Passion'  or 'Obsession' in Hindi. I'm going to go with obsession here and add the CD to the O, because the dining room was meticulous and almost wastefully  vast, and the wait staff, were they an Olympic team, would win the gold in Synchronized Service. A gold also goes to the sommelier, who used adjectives like 'brooding' and 'oafish' and 'biodynamic' and I'm pretty sure he was referring to the wine because I'm not biodynamic.. He steered us toward a middle range Alsace Gewurztraminer that squeezed my inner oenophile's grapes in a glorious sip of fermented sadism. I think I love him.The food:It's Indian. And here's where we step down from what could have easily been a five star experience to 4. The food was really good.

I mean, if ya wanna be pretentious, hit up Blue Hill at Stone Barns, or Per Se, or the like (and in NY, there are MANY that fit that bill).

3.0,7/29/2012,"Junoon had been on our list of restaurants to try for a while. And we finally made it there on a Sunday for dinner at 8 PM. Our dinner lasted much longer than we expected or anticipated - a whole 2 hours and 45 minutes!We made a reservation on Savored for 4 ppl since that is the max number the system allows. Someone from the restaurant called us a day prior to confirm the reservation - I explained at that time that our group would be 4 adults and a 3 year old child. She said she had made a note and appropriate arrangements would be made for our seating. When we arrived, I spent the first few minutes explaining my reservation to the hostess, she said that she had a reservation for only 4 ppl and that there were 5 of us. After having us wait for about 15 minutes in the lounge area, we were finally seated. Our server - Sandeep greeted us and took our order for food and drinks. He was very professional and courteous. When we told him that the child was hungry, he immediately got a dish of rice and daal. His service made up for all the confusion in the beginning with our seating. We placed the order of 4 drinks, 4 appetizers and 4 entrees since we knew what we wanted and didnt want to wait on the entrees later.We were started of with amuse bouche and the drinks/appetizers. For drinks we ordered the Tandoori Tequila, Bourbon Peche, Saffron Champagne and East Side Gin. The Tandoori Tequila was awesome, havent tasted so much flavor in a drink in quite a while. For appys, we got the piri piri shrimp, noorani kabab, veg seekh kabab and lasooni gobi. All appys were really good. During our course, we had another server serve us. We asked him if Chef Vikas Khanna was around. He told us that the Chef was in India and that we should call ahead if we'd like to meet the chef. He said his name was Rahul. Rahul went on to tell us that he was the Chef's ""right hand"" and knew all about his wherabouts. He also told us about how the Chef was President Obama's personal chef..etc etc,After we were done with the appys, began the never ending wait for the entrees. We mightve easily waited 30-45 minutes for the entrees. At this time, we were served a complimentary appy - watermelon shorba. Our server Sandeep told us that it would help to stimulate our appetite and that our entree was ready. The wait really killed our appetite. The entrees finally arrived. We had got the chicken kabab, lamb kolhapuri, paneer/mirch saalan and kofte. The food was quite tasty but we had to get most of it to go since we couldnt eat much. When we asked for our cheque, we also gave feedback to the Chef's ""right hand"" Rahul that the wait was too long. His response really threw us off! ""Yeah, I agree but thats why we gave you the complimentary watermelon shorba."" I dont want your damn complimentary stuff, just give me what I ordered. They forgot to give us the 30% off that goes with every savored reservation, that took another few minutes and we were finally done with Junoon. The points that Junoon scores on its food, it totally loses on its service. I've been to many ""Celebrity Chef"" restaurants in the past and Junoon is at the bottom in terms of its service. Chef Khanna please make sure you give your ""right hand"" a class in ettiquette and mannerism! With so many restaurants that score close in taste and much better in service, this was the last time I'd step in at Junoon!",1,0,0,Ed D.,"Toronto, Canada",58,290,186

It was busy, but not crowded, yet we still waited a fair amount for a table even with a reservation. The hostess kept trying to get us to go the bar and order a drink while we waited, which I took as a bad sign - the wait is gonna be so long that we can have a round of drinks first?We were finally seated at a nice table in the middle of the room, that apparently is the pathway for all the waiters to sprint from their tables to the kitchen. Our table was bumped by rushed waiters about  oh, 4 or 5 times but I stopped counting after that. Not the most pleasant thing to have to keep grabbing your water and drink glasses so they won't get knocked over.The food ended up being very good, although not fantastic. I had the eggplant, lamb curry, and coconut rice pudding. The eggplant was tasty, although very much like tempura. The lamb curry was spicy and very good, but I had heartburn for the rest of the evening (my fault, I know). Coconut rice pudding was lovely.

3.0,7/18/2012,"Though the food was fantastic (the duck curry was delicious and the lemon crepe, too), I was actually very disappointed with the service we received at Junoon. Not our waiter -- he was great. But the attitude we received upon arriving with a Groupon (and when I had called earlier to make a reservation) was rude and dismissive. I was made to tell the hostess the exact value of my voucher approximately three times, in front of my date, which was awkward. And then we were told that ""Usually we put Groupons in the lounge, but tonight we're full, so I guess we'll put you in the dining room"" as if we were not worthy of the dining area. On top of that, for only two people, gratuity was included, even though we are excellent tippers. I realize not everyone who comes in with a Groupon is that way, but to treat everyone off the bat as if they are a lower class of patron is very aggravating.

(Dining rooms are very nice, but they do not have the same sort of faraway vacation vibe as does the lounge area.)  Part of the reason that I chose this restaurant for the dinner was its decor: gorgeous, romantic, sexy.The food was excellent; everything we ate there (the scallop appetizer, duck meatballs, the monkfish and the striped bass) was perfectly cooked and beautifully presented. The dessert (kheer) was by far the best I've had in any Indian restaurants.  However, I was not impressed with the cocktails, nor with the fact that they added an 18% tip on the check for 2 diners, which seemed odd.",1,0,0,hk k.,"Seattle, WA",6,43,1
4.0,7/15/2012,"Went with a group-on deal. It was kind off disappointing at first to be seated in the lounge area, instead of the dinning area. However. the lounge is extremely pretty. The problem is that the table on which the food is served is at a lower level, since its not meant to be a dining area; only for drinks. We soon got over that because the decor was extremely pretty. After we were seated the waitress came after 10-15 minutes, which was kind off odd, since we were really dehydrated and wanted something to drink ASAP. She apologized for the delay and was very nice and explained us the whole menu and what the groupon deal offers with a smile. The service after this initial wait was super quick and extremely efficient. We ordered chicken kababs and shrimp appetizers. The chicken was amazing! The wine that was served wasn't very good and we ended up ordering the mai tai and Highland Cooler which were superb. Entrees we ordered chicken malvani and trout- both extremely succulent and great taste. Dessert- kulfi!!! excellent.  We were very happy with the food. However dont forget to read the fine print on the groupon which states that there is a 18% gratuity automatically added to the pre- discount amount and  which for us was $35. Also the goupon does not included roti/naan or rice which is extra. We ended up paying $80 over the groupon.

3.0,7/9/2012,"Went back to Junoon last night with a groupon and had a very similar experience. The food was great, the service was extremely attentive, but I still think the pricing is insane unless you go there with a deal. $15 for a three-shrimp appetizer? $30 for a lamb curry? $24 for boneless chicken thighs tandoori-style? It just doesn't make sense to me. I want to love this place, but the pricing means that I'll never go there without some sort of discount.Worth noting: eating in the lounge area is superior to eating in the dining area, at least during an off-peak time (Sunday night, around 7pm). My dining companion and I were seated together on a loveseat in a corner, facing the rest of the lounge. The decor and vibe is a lot more interesting and less stuffy than the main dining rooms.",1,0,1,Ben H.,"New York, NY",50,25,0
4.0,7/9/2012,"Sat in the lounge for dinner last Saturday night. Reservations for 6 pm, so a little surprised that the place was very sparsely occupied during our dinner. My husband got a Groupon for two three-course dinners -- appetizer, entree, dessert and two glasses of wine. We started with the Piri-Piri shrimp and the lashooni gobi, which is breaded fried cauliflower. Both were very good. We really liked the cauliflower. The spices were assertive but not so overwhelming that you couldn't taste the vegetable. Entrees were the tandoori lobster and murg lababdar, which is their version of chicken tikka marsala, The lobster, which consisted of two tails, was overcooked. The chicken was fine, but we didn't think it was so much better than what we've had in other less expensive Indian restaurants. For dessert, we shared the apple tarte tartine and coconut rice pudding. The pudding was excellent. I wished it was more than a few spoonfuls. In general, we liked the restaurant and would probably go back if we were in the neighborhood. On the fence about making a special trek.If you were using a Groupon or similar deal, be aware that 1. the tip is added to the bill, and 2. the 18% tip is based on the ""original"" price of the meal. In our case, we sort of got screwed because they based the tip on a meal costing about $162. If we were to buy what we had a la carte -- no Groupon -- it would only come out to about $135. We would have given a generous tip based on the actual price of the food we consumed, but they didn't give us that opportunity. We just wished they hadn't inflated the price of the meal for the larger tip.",0,0,0,Jeanne T.,"White Plains, NY",2,33,0
3.0,7/8/2012,"Let me start out by saying that for most of the meal I thought I was going to give this place 5 stars--however the snafu with the bill at the end knocked it down to 3. I went with a friend to this place with a bloomspot deal for 2 cocktails & 2 appetizers one day after work. We got there about 20 min before our reservation but they seated us (in the lounge area) with no problem. We were seated by the blonde hostess/waitress who took my certificate right away. When I asked her if my friend could get a mocktail instead of a cocktail since she wasn't feeling well, she told us we could order anything we liked off the menu, didn't have to be limited to drinks & appetizers, and at the end of the meal they would take $80 off the total bill since that was what the certificate's value was. I thought wow, that's a much better deal than I thought! Wanting to be sure, I asked her several times if she was sure it was $80 off the meal & she repeatedly told us yes, she was certain. So we proceeded to order much more than we thought we would to make sure we got it to at least $80. This lady was serving us for part of the meal, as well as another gentleman, and they both gave good suggestions & were very friendly. Add to that, everything we ordered was excellent, so my friend & I were very happy. When the male waiter brought us our bill however, nothing was taken off the total. We told him the lady had taken our certificate & that $80 should be deducted. He said no problem, and after a while brought us back our bill--but only $52 was taken off! We asked him to bring over the lady since she'd said it was $80. Eventually she came by & said that she had been confused with another offer & that it was actually $52 value not $80. What?? We told her that's exactly why we asked her about it like 4 times before we ordered anything & thought she at least checked! Since she had told us the wrong thing, and that was why we'd ordered much more, we said that should be honored instead of us being penalized for her mistake! She apologized & said she would speak to the manager. The manager eventually came over & asked what the issue was. At this point we were getting aggravated that the waitress had made a mistake & instead of just taking care of it, now 3 people & 45 minutes after initially getting the bill we were being made to explain ourselves as if we were trying to pull something! I mean really, I have happily spent SO much more money on food at nice restaurants & that was not the problem--but it felt like being misled & the principle of the matter is that they should own their mistakes! In any case the manager said he understood & finally $80 was taken off the bill, but the whole situation should never have happened & been resolved much sooner. At least the staff was polite the whole time. I still tipped on the whole amount but 17% instead of the 20% I normally tip. I would still go back because I REALLY enjoyed the food & the place itself! So here's the review of that:Ambiance--lovely, especially liked the indian swings turned into tables. Would be a nice place for a date.Drinks--I had the Caraway Cooler & my friend had the Jaswal. Both very refreshing on the hot day but WAY too much ice, very little actual drink!Food--generous portions, I was surprised. We had the paneer pakora appetizer (with yummy chutney), then I got the tandoori-style lambchops (very tender), and my friend got the eggplant curry, along with naan. Everything was delicious & nicely presented. The dessert menu was odd since none of them were very Indian, but we got the coconut rice pudding which was light with interesting flavors (ginger, dates) that went well together.I do think the food is good enough to be worth the regular prices, just wish it didn't take so long to sort out their mistake with the bill!",0,0,0,Ipsita D.,"Union City, NJ",2,79,33

We enjoyed it thoroughly and would definitely come back for this dish. However, the rest of the meal was merely ok. Nothing particularly good or disappointing, but with Junoon's prices and reputation, we expected much more. We were seated in the lounge instead of the main dining room because we had a Bloomspot voucher. That's fine, but the table was awkwardly low, which meant that we had to bend at a weird angle all night to eat. The set up would have been fine for drinks, but not for a multiple course dinner. The service ran hot and cold. The staff was well trained and attentive, when they are around. At random points of the night though, they disappeared completely. I'm all for leisurely meals, but our dinner took over 2.5 hours and a lot of it was spent waiting for someone to show up. (And yes, as other reviewers mentioned, the bathroom was a mess.)And the food? The eggplant chaat appetizer was nice and the dessert was heavenly. Nothing particularly memorable came in between.

4.0,7/6/2012,"Very pleased with my gdine purchase and great lunch. Junoon is a beautiful restaurant (unlike other Indian restaurants that over-kill the place with cheap Indian handicrafts and motifs). The decor is very elegant. The place is over-sized or probably there were just a few tables filled during our lunch at 2 PM. Our server was nice and she waited on us with a smile (she could have been a little friendlier but thats alright). We were a party of four and we each got to order an appetizer, entree, and dessert. Appetizers we ordered were great (especially paneer pakoras and the chicken tikka). For main course we ordered the Murgh lababdar, Patiala goat, Murgh Korma, Lotus root kofte, and an extra cauliflower and spinach dish. While all of the non-vegetarian items were fantastic, the vegetarian items were just okay. We expected the kofte to be very flavorful but we felt as if something was a miss with that one. The cauliflower was actually nice and not very spiced up which is good as you get to taste the vegetables as well. The two chicken and one goat dish was excellent. The goat was cooked very tender in a spicy yet flavorful curry. Similarly the korma and lababdar were top notch too and each had their own unique flavor. For dessert, we got the kulfi trio (paan, mango, and kesar pista), chocolate cake with hazelnut, and coconut rice pudding with ginger ice cream. Kulfis and rice pudding was delicious.

3.0,7/5/2012,"I don't really go to Indian restaurants because they usually disappoint. Having heard of Vikas Khanna, I had to give it a try for what many deemed innovative. I went for the prefix lunch and sat in the dining room. The dining room reminded me of a Hilton steak house with large upholstered chairs and lacked the ambiance that the front of the house boasted. Don't get me wrong, they spent some money on this joint but they didn't follow through.I realize that Vikas Khanna wouldn't be around during lunch and expected that the food would lack luster. It didn't lack much but marination. The sauces were excellent but as soon as you sinked your teeth in the meat, you may as well have been sampling British Bangers. It would have been great if the meat was allowed to absorb some spices. Service was excellent and prompt.Overall, if you are having a hankering for Indian food that isn't swimming in a vat of oil, then certainly give Junoon a shot. Of course the cost may deter many but the prefix lunch is a cost effective way to try it out.",1,0,0,Dj U.,"Brooklyn, NY",11,59,5

It's always nicer to dine in the dining area.. but what do you expect after you get a great deal? What more to ask from a Michelin Star Restaurant..This is so far the best groupon.. Almost everything on the menu you can order without adding any additional money.. So here's what we order:Appetizer:- Piri Piri Shrimp: Mmmm.. There are some avocado as a side.. The shrimp is too good.. Till I can't find a word to describe it..- tandoori Pineapple scallop.. Look at the design.. It looks like an egg in the middle.. But the ""egg yolk"" is probably some butter and some oil with some of their spices.. I LOVE IT!!! It tasted soo delicious together with the scallops...Entree:- Tandoori Halibut Moiley: A small portion.. The gravy with the fish is buttery/cheesy.. With a little sweet and salty.. (kinda reminds me of chinese food.. well back in Malaysia).. I guess this is why I love it so much.. We ordered Paratha and I kept dipping the bread to the sauce.. :D- Slow-braised lamb shank.. It looks huge!!! but we both shared and I think I ate 75% of it.. lol.. I am not a huge fan of lamb but the meat of the lamb was so soft and tender.. And yes.. the gravy was amazing.. my friend prefer this to the fish.. But I prefer the Halibut.. Well.. great then, we don't have to fight..Dessert:- Crepe: Smallest crepe in the world.. well.. is not an indian dessert.. Pretty good to enjoy after a meal.. It's not too huge..- Spice chocolate cake: Chocolate is rich.. and it is SPICY!! You can see the spice on top of the cake.. probably not a good combination.. but you get a ""feel"" of the Indian spice..Service was pretty good.. Environment is just perfect for dating..

4.0,6/30/2012,"Impressive. It's so nice when you walk in with hefty expectations and they're all met. Everything was top-notch: stately decor, a friendly host, prompt and professional service, delicious food, and fantastic wine. Junoon is really a high-caliber restaurant by any measure, offering Indian food in perhaps the most elegant setting in the city.  Dining here feels like a special occasion, even if you're just here with your groupon on a Tuesday night. From the amuse to the dessert, every bite of our meal was expertly crafted with equal attention to texture and flavor. We grossly over-ordered, my date and I each testing an appetizer and an entree, ordering rice and naan with our meal, and splitting dessert. Fortunately, Junoon was happy to wrap up our leftovers and leave them at the coat-check for when we were ready to leave. Finally, I have to give serious credit to the team behind Junoon's exemplary wine list. I simply couldn't decide on a vintage and the house sommelier helped pick out a new addition to their stock- a deep, complex red which complemented my order perfectly. Even with the great food, I'd say my wine was probably the highlight of the visit. It was that good. I've yet to dine at the revered Tamarind Tribeca, but compared to fellow-Michelin starred Tulsi, Junoon shines much brighter.

4.0,6/4/2012,"I dined at Junoon this past weekend and am super impressed.Our dinner reservation was for 6:30pm, we were seated promptly, the restaurant was quite empty. The restaurant is big and beautifully done up. The service was very prompt. We started off with a mint lemonade, which was nice and refreshing but a bit tangy.APPETIZERSPANEER PAKORA- these are fried pieces of homemade spiced paneer served with green chutney. The pakoras were piping hot and had the perfect crunch. Tasted delicious. The chutney or jam served along was nothing too great. It was lacking flavor. But the pakora was delicious.NOORANI KEBAB - these are two-layer kebab of minced lamb and chicken. I was not at all impressed with this dish. It was luke warm and the flavors were ok. The kebabs did not melt in my mouth. The green chutney was average. I will skip this one next time. MAIN COURSE: HYDRABADI CHICKEN KORMA - This is a handi tandoor-cooked chicken simmered in a sauce with cashew nuts, white poppy sees and cream. The chick was very tender. The sauce was delicious. Overall a flavorful dish. The cashew nuts and the cream make the dish rich and heavy. But quite scrumptious. PANEER LABABDAR -  Tawa homemade spiced paneer in a rich sauce with tomato, onion and fenugreek. This was my favorite dish at dinner. Fantastic and very rich flavors. The paneer was of excellent quality and the dish had nice chunky pieces. It was a burst of flavors in your mouth. Rich and absolutely delicious. Highly recommend this one. JUNOON YELLOW DAAL TADKA - Masso, chana and toor dals simmered with chilies, tumeric and cumin - The daal was good but nothing to die for. I have definitely had some better daals. It however had all the flavors and was a good addition to the other richer dishes. Onion Naan - Was good Mint Laccha paratha - was ok,i prefer the naan. DESERT:Much to our surprise there were not very many (or any) traditional Indian deserts We tried the SEASONAL TRIO OF KULFI - the three flavors were Paan, Cardamom and Mango. This was absolutely fantastic. The flavors were strong and present. I was ecstatic to eat a kulfi with paan flavor. It was so refreshing and tasty. Immediately transported me back to India and my paan eating experience. A MUST TRY!After the dinner, i approached the open kitchen and requested to speak with Chef Vikaas. He came out prompty and was very humble and sweet. We stood and chatted for almost 15 minutes about his food and his desire to bring the traditional dhabha food and be true to his roots. I was very happy to meet him and see how genuine of a person he is. Overall a wonderful evening with great food, ambiance and service.This is an expensive michelin star restaurant. It is a fine dining restaurant and be prepared to pay dearly for your meal. Our dinner was $150+ .",1,0,0,Shruti K.,"Brooklyn, NY",149,179,152
2.0,6/1/2012,"I really had high hopes for this place. Ive seen Vikas compete on Food network, read a bunch of reviews, saw the Michelin star,  and finally had a chance to come down for dinner with one of my foodie girlfriends.  We didnt have reservations on a thursday night and were seated promptly in the lounge area at the front.  The space evokes thoughts of cipriani, palatial and definitely done on a serious budget.  For ambiance alone, I'd give the place 4 stars. We ordered a couple of cocktails, both refreshing albeit a bit watered down, while deliberating the menu and doing a bit of people watching. The crowd was noticeably non indian, and fairly dressed up.  Not surprising I suppose considering the prices.  Several tasting menus are offered and vary from about $60 and up, depending on the number of courses and wine pairings. I really was at a loss. Go with my gut feel or quiz our waitress, a cute and girly 20something that raved about almost everything on the menu.  So much for getting advice.  What popped out at me were the inside out kebabs. These came out quickly and definitely looked interesting.  Taste and texture however left a lot to be desired: rubbery and verging on overly piquant. Next came the mains. We opted for the rendition of chicken tikka masala as well as the lamb shank.  The chicken dish was a toss up. Yes, I can taste the fresh tomatoes and the smokiness of the tandoor and the chicken had the right texture. Yet overall it was underseasoned and lacked complexity or richness.  The lamb shank was butter soft and the portion was very much shareable. Here again, none of the expected flavor profiles manifested.  It was lamby and boring. Even the sauce was watery and bland.  I dont know how you can stew something for hours and hours and impart very little flavor. In the end, Junoon left us still hungry and yearning for masala (spice!).  Both a first in an indian establishment :(",1,0,0,Alex R.,"New York, NY",186,224,22

4.0,5/30/2012,"This review is a bit outdated but the taste still lingers. Three of us brave guys, somewhere between acquaintances and friends, and our first date without the wives, decided to try out this swanky new Indian place with a fabled interior and hard to come by tables. We entered early with no reservations, it was empty! Of course they were fully booked! Anyway we had to sit in the bar/lounge area while they were ready to seat us. The wine list was very impressive and the high priced apps scared me off at first. It was like ordering two meals, one in the lounge and one at the table. The food took a while to come but it was worth the wait.About an hour later and a bottle of wine down we were seated. When the waiter came over the first thing that came to mind was ""wait, are you the manager? did we do something wrong?"" (thinking). The guy looked like he just finished Harvard Law and was taking orders just for his passion for food! Anyway, timidly we ordered in an otherwise ""french"" style, but this is an Indian restaurant with there grown men from the old country! Nice touch to the local folk.I will say this simply and quickly without much flowery language - the food was stunning! Mild and delicate flavors without the overpowering spices. My friends are vegetarian so I ended up trying some of their food which was really good. All in all it was a very good meal and great experience which brought us closer together as friends.

2.0,5/29/2012,This is Indian food made for non Indians= bland and unsatisfying. I'm not Indian but I'm married to one so I enjoy this flavorful cuisine. 1st thing I ordered was a pea soup( over salted so I could not taste the flavor of the peas). 2nd course was chicken tikka. My chicken was raw and bland. Usually this is one of my fav dishes. Even served it at my wedding. 3 rd course faired a bit better. Lamb chops they were good. 4th course was the kulfi( Indian ice cream). It was frozen so solid we waited an extra 15 min till we could eat it. We ordered wine  but the service was poor and we didn't get it till the end of our 2nd course. It's a shame because we were really looking forward to trying the cuisine from this famous chef.

4.0,5/28/2012,"Junoon is a case of creative cooking gone a little amuck.  Vikas Khanna claims to represent five techniques of Indian cooking--pot, fire pit, stone, griddle and clay oven--and delivers variety that comes at the expense of uniformly high quality.  But before I label this a case of misdirected passion (junoon=passion), I must say that Junoon has one of the best ambiances of any Indian restaurant in New York, and the classic North Indian dishes taste next only to their versions at Tamarind in Tribeca.  I have been to Junoon on about ten occasions and have found that it is both expensive and frustrating to stray away from the mainstream dishes on the menu.  I would wholeheartedly recommend the paneer pakoras and the chaat from the selection of appetizers.  The entrees offer a fair selection--pick one of the channa pindi, daal makhani or daal tadka (listed as  accompaniments) or the bhindi.  The desserts are unusual for an Indian restaurant.  Lemon crepe?  Apple tarte?  Chocolate parfait?  Stick to the kulfi trio, but try and have them make all three kulfis in the trio the same--the pistachio kind.Junoon is in the triumvirate of Indian restaurants in New York that have been awarded a Michelin star, besides Tamarind and Tulsi, and I can see why.  Junoon certainly beats out Tulsi, but it does not compare equal to Tamarind in Tribeca.",25,23,24,Srini V.,"Manhattan, NY",467,463,97

As we walked down the street, I am captivated by the beautiful decor in this huge restaurant, and was nicely surprised that Junoon was his restaurant of choice - especially for someone who is not terribly fond of Indian food ;)We were seated in the lounge area and given a few menus. We started off with a glass of red por moi and a glass of white por le boify. Then we ordered the piri piri shrimp, the Duck Gushtaba (meatballs), Bass, and Lamb Chops. We ended off our meal with some interesting ice cream.The shrimp was nice and meaty - but the boify thought the sauce was a bit too much. I didn't love the duck meatballs, so he had the rest of them :) The bass was flavorful and the curry was a great addition. The lamb chops were succulent and juicy, without too much gaminess. I thought the 3 blocks of ice cream were cute and the mango was delicious!The only drawback to Junoon is that the service was a bit slow and we had to wait around a bit. It was okay, because the lounge's atmosphere was intimate and romantic, and we had a lot to catch up on. The rest of Junoon is breathtaking - from the spice rack displays near the restroom to the open kitchen in the bigger dining area.

3.0,5/23/2012,"I would have been happy & willing to give Junoon 4 stars, 5 stars even...but the whole experience kept me looking for something special.Again, like I see in all these expensive restaurants, they serve 'Gourmet' version of some cuisine (READ: Take the fun & flavor away from how its supposed to be).Service was exceptional, and menu options were few & far from many.Noorani Kabab was awesome, as were ONLY some of the curries..I tried almost everything on their menu since I was taking my mom here, who loves Vikas Khanna in the Indian version of the show 'Master Chef' where he's a judge or something.Imp. Point - Deserts: None were actually indian (which makes me think how serious were they when menu for Junoon was concieved). Can you open a mexican gourmet restaurant w/o serving margaritas ??? Then, you can't take away the sweet element from Indian cuisine.The cocktails/mocktails deserve a special mention, since many of them had an indian idea and were good.I want to go to Junoon again, but not just for impressing ppl..but for actual Indian flavor.",0,1,0,Chirayu D.,"Jersey City, NJ",21,190,0

4.0,5/17/2012,"We took advantage of a 30% off deal to visit this Michelin starred-restaurant. I was excited to visit, because it is the first time I had visited a restaurant with a Michelin star. I was not disappointed.The entry to the restaurant is spacious and we were welcomed. I waited a bit in the bar area prior to being seated and it was nicely laid out. The bar is deep enough to eat at comfortably. While I was sitting by myself, looking around, a manager came up to me and asked if I had been helped-a nice touch. We were first seated on date row-the row of 2-seater tables at the end that are all in a row, like a cafeteria. I hate that section, so I asked to be reseated. We were given a better table within a few minutes...but there as one problem.See, in a Michelin starred restaurant, I expect *everything* to be perfect, including the weatherization. There was a constant flow of cold air on my head where I was sitting. This bugged me a bit throughout the dinner, but I didn't ask to be reseated a second time. For our drinks, I ordered a Spice Trail and she ordered a Caraway Cooler. Her drink was amazing. The Spice Trail is supposed to be their version of a Martini. It sucked, it was like drinking Listerine, so I sent it back and asked them to change it for a Caraway Cooler. They did it without any fuss (although I detected a hushed conversation between the busboy and the waiter), which was classy of them.For our appetizers we ordered the Duck Gustaba and the Noorani Kebab. The Duck Gustaba was basically duck meatballs and they were absolutely delicious, the right combination of duck fat and salt and meat. Wow. The Noorani Kebab was well prepared. She preferred the kebab, me the duck. The portions were a bit on the small side, but not surprisingly small.For main course we ordered the Bagarey Baigan and the Goat Patiala. The Baigan was amazing-it's flavors were so delicate and balanced. The Goat Patiala was very, very tasty. The best part is that the portions for the main course were AMPLE. I mean, we were stuffed and we took it home. We also ordered Mint Raita, pulao and naan. For the raita, we got a massive pot of raita, which was very welcome, since we love raita.For dinner, we ordered the Coconur Rice Pudding, which comes with ginger ice cream, bananas and dates. It was delicious, although I would have enjoyed a wee bit more dates with it.I loved the meal-and I would have been in heaven if it had not been for the cold breeze on the top of my head. Best part is, after tax and tip (tip is automatically included), it came out to $125 for two people. Good price for a Michelin restaurant.I docked them one star because of the A/C problem and because the appetizer portions were too small, for having such a shitty martini drink.But you really really should go.

4.0,4/24/2012,"Full review blogged - high points below:Considered by many to be the best Indian restaurant in New York City and a winner of 2 Stars from The Times and 1 Star from Michelin, I had honestly not heard much about Junoon until my friend mentioned a great meal there, thus putting it on my ""backup"" list.  Admittedly still a novice when it comes to Indian food but wanting to experience more of the cuisine and having sought out experiences at DC's Rasika and Vancouver's Vij's with good results, what interested me the most about Junoon was it's under-the-radar status despite a celebrity chef in Vikas Khanna, a seemingly prime location, and a lunch menu that read almost as impressively as that at dinner (something that cannot be said for Tulsi - the other contender for best upscale Indian Cuisine in the city.)With the decision rather spur of the moment and without reservations it was just prior to 2pm when I walked through the doors of 27 West 24th Street and with the area undergoing a significant amount of construction I can imagine one could have easily overlooked the restaurant despite the large, elegant exterior.  Greeted by a young woman at the hostess podium I was asked if I had a reservation and replying in the negative my coat and bags were taken before I was led through the decidedly ornate interior to a table in an a room that, aside from a couple of servers dressed in traditional outfit, was entirely empty.In terms of service, I was taken care of by Mohammad who proceeded to explain to me the restaurant's concept, sourcing, and principles - a nice touch I generally don't anticipate at Indian restaurants (even Rasika and Vij's) and he also suggested I go check out the ""spice room"" while I waited - a large space in the basement visible behind a glass window where no less than 100 spice were visible in glass jars as a young sous-chef worked off to the side with a scale, knife, mortar, and pestle.Beginning with the gold plate, the first bite as suggested by my server was the Pakora, a fritter of sorts willed with portabellas, shitakes, and earthy aromatic spices within topped with a sauce made of  coconut, mint, cilantro, yogurt, and ajwain - not spicy in the least this was a nice way to open and also led nicely into the second bite, Lahsooni Gobi with crispy cauliflower seasoned with chili, sweet garlic tomato chutney, and micro cilantro...to my palate it almost tasted Italian, but with a touch of heat and substantially more aromatic on the palate.With the vegetable options gone the following trio of bites would increase the heat and degree of complexity beginning with Piri Piri Shrimp in Goan Chili Sauce with ginger, garlic, avocado, and jicama, a good bite but perhaps ""too much"" for the mild shrimp which was there mostly in texture and a touch of sweet.  Faring better, the Duck Gushtaba, a meatball with spicy green chilies, a touch of mint, and aromatic almond saffron sauce was outstanding as the chili/saffron combination was beautiful on the palate in enhancing the supple duck.  Finally, rounding out the platter, the Patthar Ka Gosht was described as the chef's favorite dish featuring house ground garam masala, tandori roasted onion and pineapple chutney, and nutmeg weaving beneath a sausage made by using lamb that had been ground five times over into a creamy pate...it was truly remarkable, though admittedly a bit hot for my mild Midwestern tongue.For my main course,delivered tableside along with tender pulao rice and a basket of Naan with a portion doled out onto my (ironically) gold-rimmed plate, Duck with Tellicherry Peppercorn, curry leaves, tamarind pulp, and coconut milk would once again show off the restaurant's quality of sourcing and preparation as the Long Island duck breast was roasted to a perfect medium with crisp skin and its characteristic flavor in delicate balance with the smoky, sweet, and slightly tart sauce.  Generally not one to eat rice a few bites proved the grains to be well cooked and slightly pan crisped with notes of saffron and generally one to love bread I devoured the pillowy Naan but deferred a second basket in a rare showing of restraint.Deferring coffee largely because I'd had quite enough at breakfast, dessert would come next and as expected, it was superb.  Titled simply Coconut Rice Pudding and featuring a thick dollop of basmati rice cooked down with coconut milk and shredded coconut plus sugar I'd not be lying if I said I'd have been happy with a whole bowl of this, but gilding the proverbial lily the team at Junoon upped the ante by topping the pudding with a quenelle of creamy ginger ice cream and a scoop of candied almonds while bruleed bananas, dates, and rum glaze completed the plate.  Intensely sweet but otherwise a lovely balance of textures I'd put this quite high on the 'best rice pudding' list.",4,0,4,Michael U.,"Las Vegas, NV",3078,4440,99503

For the record, I went twice in two weeks.  I would say the name is accurate.  The restaurant is spacious, beautiful and dimly lit  so everyone looks absolutely gorgeous and not great for taking picture of food.  So I focused on the eating instead. The staff was welcoming,  knowledgeable and could not have been nicer.  The bar is the perfect place for a solo diner or for groups.  I arrived slightly early for our reservation so took the opportunity to test out the bar stools.    I had the delicious Bourbon and Peche cocktail, spiced with a hint of cumin.  I am a huge fan of the unexpected and clever use of ingredients. Spices, an integral part of Indian cuisine, are roasted, ground and blended daily in Junoon's Spice Room, which is located on the lower level, visible to the public and definitely worth a visit.Normally, my options are limited, but at Junoon the vegan and vegetarian options are plentiful.   Rather than limit myself, I ordered and ate like someone told me not to.  Below is a list of my culinary journey.  APPETIZERS:Seasonal Pakoras - I had them both times.  They are the perfect appetizer with which to wet our appetite and continue perusing the menu.   Mushroom with Coconut and Red Chilies and Eggplant with freshly ground ajwain.Lahsooni Gobi - Crispy florets of cauliflower with chili flakes and garlic tomato chutney was sumptuous and you would be remiss if you did not order this melange of deliciousness.MAIN COURSE:Saag aur Gobi - Cauliflower florets stir fried with spinach, roasted cumin, chopped tomato and fenugreek leaves.   Of all that I tried, this was my least favorite.  Ordered the first time, but not the second.    There's so much more to order and stuff your face with, it just wasn't anything that I felt the need to order again.Bagarey Baigan - I ordered this dish of baby eggplant both times and encourage you to do the same.  The delicate vegetable  is covered in a sauce of dried coconut, curry leaves, peanuts and tamarind.  The eggplant has an unctuous and luxurious mouth feel.  The tantalizing sauce with which it was blanketed was was no match for the garlic naan.Channa Pindi - Chickpea with onion,  ginger garamasala, coriander and cumin powder.  It was a blend of perfectly spicy and wonderful.  I could make a meal out of this and the naan, which in fact, I did.  There was just enough to for me to bring home and enjoy for breakfast.Amritsari Aloo Wadi - Sundried black lentil dumplings simmered with potatoes, turmeric and chili look like little meatballs.  They are dense and hearty and flavorful.  DESSERT:Apple Tarte Tatin with Salted Caramel, Pistachio Streusel and Fennel Ice Cream - Because I adore all things fennel, I really wanted to try the ice cream.   While not vegan, it is so beyond worth a tiny little splurge.   I am going to have to figure out how to make a non dairy version because I'm like a teenage girl who saw Justin Bieber.   It's been nearly three weeks since I had it abd I can't stop gushing about it.  I've been consumed by thoughts of it.  I want to put a poster of it on my wall.Junoon is now, well, a junoon, an obsession and will be on the list of places people should try when visiting New York City.knifestylesofthefitandfa…",1,0,1,Shana R.,"New York, NY",123,23,8
3.0,4/2/2012,"maybe it's a recent thing because my partner has been here on business dinners in the past and the service matched the Michelin rating- this Sunday I think we got the B team. It was like the waitresses didn't work there- they normally worked at Dukes or something diner-ish and were filling in.  No suggestions, (ex do you want a naan, do you want chutneys) all thinkgs we would have gladly paid up for....no introduction (walked up tot he table about 15 minutes after us sitting there and asked to take our order flo from the diner style), and confused looks all around- nothing particularly wrong but nothing special.  Food is OK- naan is dry and boring.  I think the ambiance is the best part.  The service should match that and who cares what the food tastes like- but with middle of the road food and middle of the road service- you might as well head to tamarind where the food is a little better.  I will say the bus staff was ON it- really great.  They should be promoted to waiters as they were suggesting things, up selling, and always around!  The bar area is beautiful- probably hit that instead.",0,0,0,Karla S.,"New York, NY",200,36,0

The food comes out very quickly.Started off with an amuse bouche shot, which had a nice kick of chili oil. We both had the gold platter (selection of 5 appetizers). Liked the cauliflower and the lamb. Thought the meatballs were so-so. Piri shrimp was quite tender.My duck entree was pretty much minuscule. The waiter placed 3 tiny pieces on a massive plate with about 2 spoonfuls of rice. It looked kind of ridiculous. Dining partner enjoyed his lobster tandoor. We had to supplement our meal with a 3rd entree - went with the cauliflower, which was good, but mushy and quite spicy.Ended dinner with a mango lassi mmmm!Overall I don't really think this was worth it for Indian..",2,1,1,Eva W.,"San Francisco, CA",625,390,15
4.0,3/30/2012,"I just got back from dinner at Junoon. I went to Tamarind last night...fancy Indian overload?  Well, I won't be having Indian for a while but I saw a Bloomspot deal for $48 for $80 worth of stuff here and couldn't resist. I wanted to try this place since it opened. Bf and I waltzed in around 6pm- no one was there. I mean. the place was MASSIVE. I especially loved the beautiful dining room, as well as the room downstairs that holds the spices ( near the bathroom...also massive). As it's been said, I don't feel the decor is overly Indian (Tamarind is more such) but it's certainly..exotic? Asian? There is a huge welcoming foyer with a fountain...lots of rich colors...big candles.. you catch my drift. We sat in the lounge and ate here because the deal only allowed us to eat in the lounge. We could have picked anywhere we liked...note, if you get this option, sit at the fun, swinging chairs/table..not the ""sofa"" where we sat. It was SO uncomfortable. On service- food came out very fast. Portions are definitely smaller than Tamarind and the prices are more expensive, but we still ate way more than enough food. Our waiters/waitress was very nice, and didn't have an issue with the deals. Waters were filled at the right time (except once.. I needed more than usual- it was spicy food!). The only major slowness was getting the check. But no pushiness with drinks or dessert, etc. On food- Very pricey. Has about $10 on Tamarind but not a whole Yelp $ better, if you catch my drift.  We were started with some very yummy, buttery and salted biscuits (some kind of popper)..honestly, these didn't taste Indian. They were kind of like the biscuits you get at Red Lobster but bite sized. We then got the amuse bouche- shot of cauliflower soup fried chickpea inside. This was really interesting and played with texture.. but the cauliflower was very strong.We had the piri piri shrimp to start.. this was $15 and only came in 3...and they weren't even jumbo. The sauce atop was almost like a steak sauce/ketchup over shrimp w tails. The shrimp was nicely cooked and had a yummy smokey after taste. The side salad was jicoma, and came with a mandarin slice... good. The best part was the sauce but overall the dish wasn't worth it. We shared the two entrees- the halibut (one small-med piece), cooked in a medium brown coconut curry sauce. It was $34 Pricey...but also cooked very much to perfection. It wasn't overcooked but still had good meatiness to it. The sauce was spicy..almost like a vindaloo.  I had a bit of heartburn after.  We also shared the kersala chicken, which was $24. It was very juicy and well marinated chicken thigh chunks, that was awesome with a bit of lime squeezed atop. Came with a square shaped radish- yogut (?) salad and green sauce (some kind of bland-ish chutney) We had about 4 pieces? This was very tender and tasty.For sides, we ordered a garlic naan at the recommendation of our server- though Tamarind's naan was fluffier and better. $7 ish. This was fine..nothing special, standard. We also ordered the junoon daal- made with yellow lentils. This was very good..and healthy too. You don't get as much of a strong lentil flavor vs the spiciness..some $12We spikpped desert. After tax and tip (on pre discounted amount), I ended up spending over the deal amount (by 40, so that plus deal. .. a bit over 80 in total). It wasn't that cheap, but something is better than nothing. I probably wouldn't come back but glad  tried it...definitely a good place for celebration.",5,0,0,Stephanie Y.,"New York, NY",878,1242,25

The fact that Chef Vikas Khanna is super cute.. has absolutely nothing to do with with love for this place.. just saying!So when I walked into this place (it had been recommended to my brother by a ""non Indian"" friend), I had no clue who Vikas Khanna was.. or so I thought :pThe place is HUGE.. for NYC standards, where knee touching is common! Very upscale, hip ambiance, smiling service (our server was a bit too knowledgeable though, i felt).. but it was all good.**The one thing to realize when you order food is - Anything with HAANDI (crock-pot)  on the menu will have gravy, anything with TAWA (shallow skillet) on the menu will have a little sauce, but will be dry otherwise**Started off with the Lehsuni (garlic flavored) Gobi .. think Indian style Gobi Manchurian.. lightly fried gobi (cauliflowerets) in a nice tangy sauce. My only gripe.. there wasn't much lehsun flavor here.The seasonal pakoras came next. Not a fan! The texture of these non traditional falafel/ meat ball  style mushroom/ spinach pakoras was a little off and the green mint chutney definitely left much to desire :( The Kadi pakora was real yum.. again, the pakoras in it were non traditional - falafel style than the usual ones, but the flavors were spot on!Akbari Paneer - personal favorite! Loved the flavors of the sauce and the texture. Super rich tho - for anyone health conscious.Hydrabadi Chicken Korma - As good as it gets..! flavor fully spicy, not overpowering though.For dessert, we had the kulfi 3 ways.. Cardamom was a personal fav, pomegranate was ok, Paan was good too :)So after dinner, we got a chance to meet Vikas Khanna .. OMG he is cute! :) Got a picture wid him too! And then I realized where I had seen him.. he was the guest judge for Hell's kitchen Finale - couple of seasons ago..

It's got all the qualities you'd expect from a Michelin-starred restaurant (great food, drinks, service, decor, attention to details), and yet it's entirely possible to dine there for under $100 pp (which is not something I can say for most of its peers).The five course tasting menu was quite filling, so I imagine that the 3 course tasting menu supplemented with an appetizer or two would also be filling enough for an average day. Of course, if you have money to burn, then go for the chef's tasting menu!

Whatever, I wasn't very impressed, especially given the prices.  To be fair, if what you want is a huge portion, then you get that here, which I wouldn't expect in fine dining. Having since read the reviews here I'm sort of surprised that Junoon has a Michelin Star, although I have eaten at a Michelin starred Indian in London which was also extremely bland, but had the same opulent surroundings.  Perhaps that's what impresses the judges?

We had two boys 15 and 11 with us and we did not order any drinks but sat in the lounge area. We were ushered in after 10 mins of wait and the restaurant was practically empty. It seems to me that it is a ploy to steer people to the bar area to encourage them to buy additional drinks.

For food, it deserves 4 stars. Also, the parfait dessert was excellent--best chocolate sorbet evah. Also, the restaurant is beautifully designed, large and spacious.  The seating is quite private and the noise level is low, so you can easily have conversations.  The open kitchen is a nice touch.  The service is a different story.

After a long time of wanting to check it out, the day finally arrived, too bad it was a bit disappointing.  While I did think the food was quite tasty and probably a step up from the average Indian restaurant, it really did not justify such exorbitant prices.Decor - The setting for the restaurant is quite amazing and probably one of the best things about the restaurant in general. Large ceilings, beautiful light fixtures, side rooms and everything else made the meal better.Service - The service here was quite good, with water glasses rarely sitting empty. My only complaint was that our cocktails, which we ordered with our meal, did not arrive until we were nearly done with our appetizers. Those should arrive first and then bring us our food.Food - This is what we ate. For appetizers we had the Piri Piri Shrimp and the Eggplant Chaat. The shrimp was quite tasty, with the sauce the true star of the dish. The shrimp could have been cooked just a tad less for me, but overall a great dish. The Eggplant chaat was crisp and one of the nicer preparations of eggplant I've had. Off to a good start.For entrees, I picked the duck tellicherry pepper, which was a simple presentation of a sliced duck breast with a spicy sauce. The sauce was incredible, however, the duck was under cooked which was a let down. We also had the Nandru Kofte which was lotus root dumpling with fried lotus root and fresh indian cheese with an onion gravy. This dish was better than my duck, despite not having any meat. On the side we had a nan, which was well done as well as the daal makhni, which was a much different style daal than I'm used to. While there were a lot of highlights among the dishes, several proteins were cooked improperly to my taste. Also when the sauce of your dish is the best part, there are issues. The sauces and flavors served in each of the dishes was really amazing, but some dishes just fell a little flat and really don't deserve the $30 price tag.

We asked for a recommendation, he didn't have one. Two other bartenders in the mean time came by asking if we had ordered, no. Finally we gave our order for winter bhangra and something else. Both were just ok. We go to our table, gave our order for eggplant chaat, the gobi app, lentil dumpling entree, black dal, gobi entree, garlic naan, and misi roti. Eggplant chaat was the best thing we had. Gobi app was soggy with the coating falling off and lacked flavor. The black dal had zero flavor. The misi roti was super tough.

3.0,2/11/2012,"2012; 1 Michelin starCame here for Winter RW during lunch time with a group of friends. Here's what I got a taste of:-duck gushtaba: soft, tender and moist-piri piri shrimp: okay-halibut konkan curry: found the (small) piece of fish dry. The curry sauce it was simmered in was okay-chicken tawa masala: DELICIOUS! The curry sauce was tasty, perfect for taking their naan and dipping it in. Chicken pieces were moist...reminded me of a fave Indian dish I tried called butter chicken.-cardamom kulfi: didn't try-chocolate caramel tart: didn't tryWe also ordered the red wine from their RW menu (don't remember the name) and it was light, fruity and perfect with our dishes. The food was presented beautifully in such a beautiful setting as well.Although I was quite happy with the food, service and especially the setting (love the fountain in the front!), from the RW menu, I only found the chicken tawa masala to be the best part of the meal.May have to return to try items on the regular menu.",0,0,0,Janel Y.,"Walnut Creek, CA",299,1407,1628

2.0,2/9/2012,"Junoon is a Michelin starred restaurant. The decor and ambiance is outstanding, not the typical high-end curry place that you are used to in New York. This place is co-owned by Vijay Mallaya, who has tried to unsuccessfully imitate Richard Branson for many years. We went their for lunch and it was quite empty on a busy Thursday and the service staff are polite and try their best to be friendly. Given that it was Restaurant week, and they had a Lunch Prix Menu  that allowed you to pick an appetizer, entree and desert. The appetizer that we ordered was called Bhaji (Fritters) and there was more oil in it than the entire country of Saudi Arabia. You have to deep fry it but not immerse it in oil. It was a very bad start. The cucumber drink that we ordered was 99% ice and we knew how it felt to drink the 1%. Given the early disappointments, we had very low expectations for the main course and we were disappointed even further, the entree was too salty and too oily. Absolutely no rich flavor that you associate with Indian cuisine. The desert was forgettable. I would not recommend foodies to waste their hard-earned money here.",3,5,0,Raja V.,"Sunnyvale, CA",91,33,2

1.0,2/3/2012,"I went here last week for lunch during Restaurant Week and though I had been there before and liked it, I will never go back after this experience. The service was abysmal which completely ruined the meal. With prodding it took over 1/2 hour to receive our menu, another 1/2 hour for the appetizer to arrive and another 45 mins. for our entree . Dessert was delayed but then there was another inexplicable delay to pay the bill. And this happened when the restaurant was not terribly busy.

5.0,1/30/2012,"I love this place. Only been here once for a very special occasion as it's a bit too expensive for my budget. But would love to come here many times again. The moment you enter it looks very grand, exclusive and elegant. The decor and amount of lighting combined with the level and choice of music makes it a perfect mix. This is very different from most other Indian places I've been to. I like the way how they make traditional home style cooking into something new. We sat in the middle of the restaurant. Had very attentive waiters. I have a few allergies I always need to confirm and the waiter was very helpful pointing out what I could eat and what I would have to avoid. Started the evening with a delicious glass of sparkling wine. Had the Murg Tikka Mirza Hasnu for appetizer and it was so juicy, never had chicken so succulent before. Because of my allergies I was a bit restricted but after narrowing down what I could eat I chose Goat Matke Wala. The waiter kind of tried to push me to have the lamb chops which was the most expensive dish on the menu, which I didn't really appreciate. Anyway, the goat was slow cooked and very tender, lot of flavours going on. I had only had goat once before and now I definately want to try it more times. I like that they put pomegranate in the raita. The naan is also good here.Plenty of options for different kinds of meat as well as vegetarian dishes. From the dining area you can see right into the kitchen, which I always think is fun to watch when they cook.Don't forget to visit the spice room down stairs by the rest rooms. It's nice to linger down there after the meal and look and smell all the spices. It's a bit pricy here, but definately worth it, a great dining experience, lot of new culinary impressions. To conclude, nothing to complain about. Best Indian restaurant I've been to. Would love to bring all my family and friends here. Executive chef Vikas Khanna has done a great job on the menu.

4.0,1/28/2012,"I'm a native of Bombay, so I'm always skeptical when someone drags me to an Indian restaurant.  But to answer the various posts below about authenticity, Junoon is as close as it comes to the real thing, in Manhattan at least.  In fact, the whole experience was reminiscent of Bombay restaurants: the airy, yet dimly lit room, the warm cleansing towels brought to us at the beginning of our meal, and the way the staff served us our initial helping of each curry.  Family style to the extreme, just like in India.Important things first: the cocktails - I took a leap with ""the sprig around the world,"" which started dinner off on the right foot - the light taste of calvados perfectly complimented the mint muddled into the drink, and it was also just a very pretty glass to look at. To start, I got the scallops seared in clarified butter.  They were incredibly tender, and not overpoweringly spicy.  My only complaint was that the portion was tiny!Thankfully, our main courses were large and very filling.  We got the Patiala Shahi Goat and the Panjabi Kadi.  The Goat was delicious - stewed until it was falling off the bone.  I'm a big meat enthusiast, but I have the say the Panjabi Kadi (vegetable pakoras soaked in a yogurt-based soup) is what made my night (up to that point) - the pakoras were moist and spicy, and I could smell and taste the curry leaves in kadi.  The power of good customer service is that you can't say no to the staff.  We accepted dessert menus to be polite, but as we glanced over them, we couldn't resist the coconut rice pudding.  The ginger ice-cream on top was strong, but I love ginger so it worked for me.  The pudding itself was creamy and light, and the dates on the side added a bit of bite to the otherwise soft airy dish.  It was the perfect end to a perfect meal.",3,0,1,Gabi R.,"Manhattan, NY",7,81,4
2.0,1/20/2012,"Extremely overrated. Despite delicate plating and fussy service, the food itself is not memorable.

Even despite the 25 minute wait, we were offered drinks and delicious bread by our bartender.As for the food, I can speak to the taste but not the authenticity as I don't know much about Indian cuisine.  I had the fish curry and also tried the duck.  Both were outstanding.

We are huge fans of Indian food and love the selections at our local takeout spots, so we went to Junoon as a treat. Ugh! The ""kebabs"" are brown parallel tracks laid down next to each other -- appetizing? The kashmiri lotus root, which were highly touted, are ovate brown  lumps topped with a lotus root chip. Eating food that is shaped in fecal masses is difficult enough, but to have it all taste like vaguely spicy regurgitated hash is even worse.

3.0,12/29/2011,"Very nice Indian restaurant.I'll start with the decor and atomosphere. Both were excellent. Very trendy, but upscale. Instead of an Indian restaurant trying to look American, it was more of an elegant American restaurant with some Indian touches. Take a walk downstairs to check out their spice room.As far as the food, I thought it was good, but not great. For appetizers, we had the Kakori Kabab. I enjoyed that a lot. The flavorful spice on the lamb really stood out. For entree, I had the Chicken Tawa Masala, which was like a Chicken Tikka Masala. It was good and I enjoyed it, but it wasn't as good as some of my other favorite Indian restaurants. It also didn't have a lot of gravy (which a tikka masala dish should). The taste of the chicken also wasn't as flavorful as I would have liked it to be.Overall, this is a very nice place to take a date, or have a birthday dinner.

I just know that if this is indeed authentic Indian, then I have been deceived by the Chicken Tikka Masala and Lamb Vindaloo I have been eating all these years.I came here with five of my boys from college for my birthday dinner. As always, Ray L. was late, so the host couldn't seat the five of us, which was slightly annoying, but did give a chance to visit the lounge and cocktail menu. We took a seat on a large regal Indian swing like a boss and ordered a couple of cocktails. The space was huge, like other restaurants in Gramcery, so we sat comfortably in the middle. All of us ordered the five-element tasting menu, each representing a style of cooking (six dishes including dessert). We never had wine with Indian before, so we asked the sommelier and  he directed us to a white followed by a red, which was paired according to the meats coming out. Garlic Butter Langoustine - Nice large langoustine with the tail split open. The garlic butter gave it some flavor while not being overwhelming. We were pretty hungry so we started to attack the claws, which disappointingly didn't have much meat.Ajwani Mushroom - Sliced pile of shitake mushrooms. The portion was a bit small on this dish. More of an afterthought compared to the other dishes.Lobster Tandoori & Dahi Wale Lamb Chop - The crown jewel of the tasting menu. Both meats were apparently marinated for 15 hours. A decently sized lobster tail baked with a proprietary blend of spices. The lamb chop was also nicely marinated with its own sauce and came out very tender.The restaurant also provided free garlic naan and lentils. The combination of the two could only be described as heavenly. It left me saying  ""OM NAAN NAAN NAAN NAAN"".We all devoured the basket of naan and shamelessly asked for seconds, thirds, fourths, etc. Venison Kebab - Two pieces of marinated venison with a nice sour kick from the lime. It was a great transition from the milder lobster and lamb chop.Duck Tellicherry - Slice duck breast on a bed of warm brown rice. My slices were a  bit rare (red in the middle), but I think my friends all enjoyed theirs. These were deserved with sweetbread, instead of garlic naan, which, while still good, was a step under the naan. Meats only, this tasting menu just gave you langoustine, lobster, lamb chop, venison AND duck for only $85 pp. The price point attracted me to the restaurant at first, but I really fell in love with the charm of the waiting staff and the auxiliary dishes. I would not hesitate to recommend this restaurant as a date place or for a large group.

The service is formal and attentive, the space heavily stylized and cavernous - reminiscent of an upscale hotel dining room. And the low spice level in the food makes it unlikely to offend any palates.If you're reading this blog though, I assume those aren't the things you want to pay a premium for. The food, while sometimes quite good, does not justify the 50%+ markup to the many solid (albeit less fancy) Indian joints a few blocks east in ""Curry Hill"". You may still enjoy stopping by the bar for one of the inventive and tasty specialty cocktails. In case you do find your self eating here, below is a rundown of what we ate and drank:Proxy Sour (a take on the Pisco Sour)- Sweet, but with out being overly so. It had a pleasant little kick from the green chilis.Fall Vegetable Seekh Kebab: The vegetables are mashed together with spices in such a way you don't feel like you're eating your veggies (see photo). But you are. And they're very good.Duck Gushtaba (Meatballs): We found these to be a little dry and skimpy on the sauce. Perhaps the two are related.Lobster Tandoori: Definitely the star of the show - the 2 tandoori spiced lobster tails were tender, juicy and very flavorful. Sadly, they were also kind of small.Chicken Awandhi Korma: The cashew and saffron flavors were nice, but there just wasn't enough of them in what was one of the thinnest curries I've ever had. If you find most Indian curries too rich, you may enjoy the subtelty of this dish. I, however, like my curries hearty and spicy and will try something else next time.Quine Tart Tatin - This dish is all about combining bitter and sweet: salted carmel, pistachio streudal and fennel ice cream.

1.0,11/10/2011,"Junoon was the most horrible experience I have ever had with a restaurant in NYC.We had made a reservation at this restaurant for 2 people. We land up on time and were asked to wait for few minutes. However that ended up as waiting for almost half an hour. This involved us checking in with the host twice on the status for the reservation as we were almost ignored and forgotten.After half an hour, realizing that our patience is running out, the host informs us that they are waiting for a previous party to clear out the table, who are still having desserts and do not seem to be in a hurry to get out. We got so disappointed with this place that we instead went for Dos Caminos a few blocks away, which I would definitely recommend to everyone out there.I do not know how good the food at Junoon is, but unless they understand that customer's time is valuable, it is not worth it.",1,0,0,Vikas S.,"Jersey City, NJ",0,2,0
1.0,11/7/2011,"The bad experience started when we walked into the restaurant. Although there were plenty of available tables, we were asked to wait by the bar, to make us order drinks. After going back to the maitre d' asking to be seated, I was asked to wait a few more minutes at the bar and suggested to ""maybe order a drink"".The food was not authentic Indian food by any means, but a failed overpriced indian fusion cousine. The only upside was the decor of the restaurant, which was very nice.After finishing our entrees, the waiter came over to sell us on desert. Although we declined, since we were full, the waiter was extremely pushy. After I declined again and asked for the check, he kept pushing with lines like: ""Are you sure you don't wanna try our amazing dessert. Let me tell you about it."", and he went on long rant about it.I will never come back to Junoon.

2.0,11/5/2011,"This place was overpriced for the quality and authenticity. It's a good place to go to 'impress' coworkers that you're into ethnic foods but we found the cauliflower dish way oversalted, the garlic nan lacking in garlic (what!??), service slow (table next to us complained too and they gave us hot towels twice by accident), lamb chop served lukewarm. The Wine list was impressive, which is actually why we bookmarked this place (it won wine spectators '11 award for its list).Dinner was almost 3 hours long, and we did not do the Chefs Menu. This is a coat check kinda place without the Quality other Indian places offer. Tamarind is much better -just eat in the main dining room, not the Tea room. For dishes averaging $30, we expected more. Ambiance-wise, it was nice...wood floors, pretty entrance, spices downstairs on the way to the WC, and music (not too stuffy but not too clubby).

Having said that...Junoon has been kind of a hit-and-miss experience. The service in the bar area is atrocious; the servers and bartender are mostly clueless, neglectful, and inattentive. The drinks are OK, but not memorable.As for the main dining area, the ambiance is chic, if a little cold. Service has been better in the past, but when my husband and I dined there recently on a Diwali night, it was slower than an arthritic turtle. The restaurant was packed to capacity and the kitchen was obviously struggling to keep up.My husband ordered the ""Duck Tellicherry Pepper,"" which, when it finally made its appearance an hour after he asked for it, turned out to be rather overcooked. The sauce was overwhelming and masked the natural flavor of the duck.I ordered ""Daal Makhani"" and ""Chicken Awadhi Korma,"" both of which were decent and met my expectations, but did not exceed them.The dessert, ""seasonal Kulfi trio,"" was forgettable.We might give this place one more chance, perhaps on a less busy night.

The portions were small and over priced. I had two cocktails, a spice trail, which tasted like an orange peel, and strawberry and rye, tasted like syrup; which made me sick, can't imagine what cheap alcohol they put in a $14 cocktail!Ordered a sampling of chutneys and garlic naan to start. The chutneys were really good, but not much better than the free ones they give you in places like Dhaba.  I like my indian food hot and was left disappointed, i even asked for some extra hot sauces on the side and never received them. Had a lamb dish, the meat was very tender, but the spices were lacking.The portions were very small and wildly overpriced. The restaurant was nice and its great not to be in an over crowded place, but any restaurant could accomplish the ambiance by lighting a billion candles.

5.0,10/2/2011,"STELLAR.   Junoon has made its way into my ""Best of 2011"" list. It is an absolute ""must go"", and I would definitely save it for a special occasion / big night out.  My husband and I went for our anniversary dinner, and they could not have been more kind to us with a champagne toast as we sat down and a lovely dessert to follow our meal.We had the Gold Plate appetizer, which at $20 a person is not inexpensive, but it gives you all of the chef's favorites and just so happened to be the exact items that I wanted to try - Pakoras, Gobi Fritters, & Piri Piri shrimp, to name a few.Enjoying the spontaneity of the Gold Plate, we had our server surprise us with our entrees, as we were so overwhelmed by how many things we wanted to try.  Our only instructions were seafood, no lobster, and meat, no lamb chops.  Junoon did not disappoint.  I had the halibut konkon curry and my husband had the lamb shoulder.  Both were knock your socks off good.  And the side order of vegetables that we had - not sure of the name of the dish, though it included green beans in what I would define as a spicy masala-based red sauce with a touch of ginger - was SUBLIME!I would totally do the tasting menu here, as well.  It's $85, but has the most perfect array of dishes and is simply mouth-watering.  I am definitely coming back for that and the Lobster Tandoori.Atmosphere is absolutely gorgeous, and I loved the entrance and the bar area.  As would be expected, service was top notch!Highly recommended.",2,0,1,Ann B.,"Birmingham, AL",5,88,8

My father in law ordered the ginger rose which was a decent cocktail... Don't get the tandoori tequila although it's recommended, instead go with the aromatic apricot .. you will thank me later !!! We actually switched our cocktail since the tandoori tequila was quite a letdown but the replacement aromatic apricot more than made up for that glitch .. For appetizer we had the lahsooni gobi which was quite spicy and flavorful .. we all enjoyed this dish, portions were good for sharing as well .. for the main course we ordered the monkfish tikka (recommended), nadru kofte (5 star dish) and the chicken awadhi korma (2 star). Nadru kofte easily was the hands down winner followed closely by the monkfish tikka. The chicken dish was bland and was not marinated at all (a cardinal sin in indian cooking) ... the curry though was creamy and flavorful .. the bread basket had a good variety of breads that were good for sharing ... For desserts we ordered the passion fruit bombe (beautiful presentation) and the trio of kulfis (although they were nowhere close to the kulfi taste back home)I really would like to give this restaurant 3.5 stars only if yelp would let me do it ..

4.0,9/10/2011,"Actually, this place is a 3.5 starts in my books. Overall a good place and certainly worth a visit esp. if you want to go to an Indian restaurant with a nicer ambience and decor. The food is good but not exceptional [there are certain other places where the food is comparable for cheaper or better, such as Amma (yelp.com/biz/amma-new-yo…)]. The service leaves much to be desired.Here are the details:5 stars for decor and general ambience: Easily one of the nicest looking Indian restaurants in NYC.  The decor is beautiful. Tall engraved panels and columns attempt to recreate a palatial Indian feel. Many dim tall candles and some modern furnishing have been woven into the historic India feel seamlessly. The entrance area makes quite a statement. In addition there is a lounge area and two fairly large dining areas.4 stars for food. The food was variable w.r.t. flavor/ taste etc. A couple of the items (Kakori kebab and Goat Matkewaala were very flavorful and extend the range of flavors that Indian restaurants typically present). However, the vegetarian items we ordered were just okay w.r.t. taste/ flavor/creativity etc. We did not sample the desserts. The dessert menu does not transition quite as seamlessly after the other courses. It has more of an Indian-western fusion feel, with an emphasis on western.  None of the items were what one would expect after a fairly tradition Indian meal.2 stars for the service. Despite the place being well staffed the turn around time between courses and the general attention to tables was poor. We had to remind them at least a couple of times regarding our order (to bring the wine or the next course). It seemed that there was a general disorganization in terms of how tables are attended to because at least 4-5 servers attended to us at various times and we ended up repeating instructions to different people.",0,0,0,Pedantic S.,"Cambridge, MA",5,155,1
5.0,8/23/2011,"Junoon is a feast for the senses. The decor, service and food are great here. I was definitely satisfied. Its been years since I had Indian food. The last time I had this type of cuisine I became terribly sick. But I wanted to give Indian food a chance and Junoon was the right choice. Especially since there was a Yelp event here not too long ago. I figured Yelp chose this place for a reason right? As soon as you walk into the restaurant, the decor was beautiful and clean. I loved the lighting, the Indian style furnishings and music. The hostess greeted me with a smile and walked me to my table. I needed to use the restroom and was pleasantly surprised by the space. There were more than enough bathroom stalls and the bathroom was stocked with paper towels, hand soap and tissue. It was pretty clean too. On the way to the bathroom there was a room behind a glass.  I think this is where they get spices, tea, etc. I don't know I'm guessing. There was someone in the room and I didn't want to be weird. Besides I was hungry and wanted to eat :-). I sat down and my server(s) were very pleasant, knowledgeable and professional. I had a voucher for Junoon and I heard (and read) horror stories of how some waiters (at different restaurants) treat the patrons a certain way if they pay with a ""coupon"". I didn't get that vibe at all from the Junoon waitstaff. I was also dressed down (compared to the other patrons) and I wasn't treated like a second class citizen. Since I was not too familiar with Indian cuisine, I asked my server for suggestions. He actually left it up to me to decide. I'm glad he did because at the end of the day its what ""I"" want. And I made some good choices. However, he did help me with picking dessert. I ordered some wine and the Sommelier greeted me with a smile and he was very knowledgeable of the wines. He was great. All the members of the waitstaff (including the Sommelier) were very attentive to my needs. I ordered the Murg Mirza Hasnu for my appetizer. I don't remember eating chicken so tender. It was seasoned just right and delicious. And the cucumber salad...WOW!!! So freaking good. Their ""plating"" of the dishes is not elaborate. They're pretty simple/plain. But I didn't mind. The quality of food is what matters. For my entree I ordered the Tandoori Chicken Roll. I'm still salivating. Again the flavors were a treat to my taste buds. I ate everything on my plate. The Tandoori Chicken Roll has a bit of a ""kick"" to it but (IMO) wasn't overwhelming. And finally, for dessert, I ordered the Cardamom Kulfi. My server helped me with this one. I had no idea what it was even when it came out. All I saw was a white cube on a white plate. Come to find out it was... Hmmm I may leave it up to you guys to find out :-). I also had the pleasure of tasting their complimentary Lassi (strawberry and yogurt). And then I cleansed my palate with some Darjeeling tea. I am definitely looking forward to coming back here.

3.0,8/15/2011,"Junoon is classy. Outfitted in a cavernous Flatiron place, adorned with modern fixtures and traditional wood carvings, Junoon stands out from both the trendy and the ramshackle Indian eating establishments that populate the city. The menu leans more towards high technique than any other sort of gimmick. It's menu is organized by cooking vessel -- I appreciated that. And most items come true to their intended flavors: The Tandoori Lobster Tails truly sing, pairing sweet lobster meat with Indian dry spices of cayenne, lemon and fennel. Punjabi Kadi or vegetable dumpling/balls are rich and creamy, spiked with buttermilk and mellowed with mustard seeds and asafoetida. Bagarey Baigan continues down the path of rich entrees, with baby eggplant thickened with a puree of cream and nuts. The heavy textures are naturally offset by the clean sides of grilled naan and plain rice. Junoon's take on Indian is similar to that of a 5-star hotel in India. Sophisticated techique, fresh ingredients meets classic homestyle dishes.The one (big) short-coming was the service and pricing. Living in Jackson Heights and being Indian myself, it's hard for me to justify paying $6 for rice pullao and $18 for baigan when I know how inexpensive these ingredients cost themselves. What a classy restaurant should have is top service (particularly when we are comparing Junoon to similar establishments in Bombay or Delhi). Service, to say the least, is lacking. It baffles me how the restaurant can have such a large staff of uncoordinated servers who spend more time ruffling the table cloth of emtpy tables than actually waiting on customers. Our entrees took a long time to arrive. Servers were distracted and never gave us our check. It felt wrong to pay so much and have such shoddy service.",16,4,6,Ravi J.,"Chicago, IL",235,212,7

At first i thought I would feel the rush of spices on my taste buds - but this was one of the most perfectly balanced cocktails I have tasted. With our food we drank beer (Estella Damm) that was inspired by Ferran Adria (i am sucker for anything El Bulli related) - it was light and had hints of coriander and cinnamon - great accompaniment to Indian flavors.  We ordered the Kakori Kebab and the Adraki Bater (quail); both of which were amazing, the quail had great flavor while the kebab was moist. We had Goat Matkewala, Black Bass Recheado and Bhutanese Red Rice for the main course. The goat and red rice were phenomenal; I would not order the fish again.All in all a great experience - took me back to fine Dining in India; the way it should be - no fusion - no pretension just good Indian Food and just the way I like it !",3,0,1,Alefiyah S.,"New York, NY",43,4,0

The food did not meet my expectations at all. Everything was so spicy!!! we ordered HYDERABADI PATTHAR PANEER very dry!

I was looking forward to the ambience and the food, but at the end of the night if one doesn't enjoy the food then the decor doesn't mean anything to me.

The bar has a swing, comfortable cushions. beautiful carved wooden arches, the fountain with candles- lighting. A lot of thought went into it, but I think the experience thereforth was all down hill (except the service- everyone really attentive!)I think (being Indian- I can say this) that Indian food cannot be gourmet (it's been tried, tried and tried again- but it's really an oxymoron!). Indian food by nature is wholesome, good, and has cheap ingredients. It's hard too justify paying $6 for plain rice (that has been aromatically seasoned with cloves). Rice is a basic staple of this planet and shouldn't be exorbitantly priced. That being said- the rest of the menu is extremely overpriced (and very underwhelming). There is definitely better Indian food that is affordable out there. We had three appetizes, three entrees, rice and the bread basket, a bottle of wine (on cheaper side of menu) and a few cocktails- it was all around $250 (for four people). eeks!!the cocktails:I had the caraway cooler- which was really refreshing and tasty- but the whole glass was full of ice! That's $12 done in three sips!. the appetizers: (meal starts out with a complimentary shot of lassi)1. seasonal pakoras (we are 4 people, they had 3 pakoras... really? couldn't give another?!)2. kakori kabab: this was tasty (but again- hefty price tag)3. spiced paneer salad: again- three pieces of paneer (blah)entrees (all taste different and were good- but nothing extraordinary or haven't had better elsewhere):1. monkfish: good! flavorful and something different2. lamb kholapuri: good- spicy3. bagarey baigan: gooddessert- we were too full, but the pastry chef gives you a nice little complimentary sample of a strawberry jelly (yum!) and choclate square (yum yum!)It might be better to come here for drinks to experience the ambiance (just make a trip to the bathroom to see the rest of the space) then go somewhere else for dinner. I was really disappointed. Not sure how long this is going to last- I can't see people regularly going back. My top indian restaurants in the city:1.

We started off with a $14 drink called Tandoori Tequila which was full to the brim with ice and was no different than a lime margarita anywhere else. Ok, I'll get passed that but then our other plates come. Let's just say, 2/5 dishes were quite good. The best thing all night, the little complimentary  chocolate that their pastry chef made. They really need to up the ante with most of the dishes if they're  going to compete with the rest, such as Vermillion, one the best in town!  Or lower the prices and stop posing.",0,0,0,Ray A.,"Manhattan, NY",60,21,0
4.0,7/17/2011,"I found that every component of Junoon was perfectly balanced--the service effectively discovered a happy medium between over attentiveness and its opposite...our waiter seemed to really concern himself with what dishes would be best suited for our palates.  The ambiance was right on the $$ and the food was simply delicious.  The cauliflower and coconut corn fritter appetizers were flavorful and the spiced chocolate cake dessert was offensively tasty. My sister got the rhubarb soup dessert which was one of the most perplexing dishes I've ever tasted...one spoonful presented what seemed like a thousand different flavors but, once consumed, were instantly harmonious. So Cool.",1,0,1,Ali S.,"New York, NY",0,7,0
5.0,7/14/2011,"Good food, beautiful decor & amazing service. Came here for dinner last Friday around 7pm with my boyfriend. We had at least 4 waiters serving us the whole meal: a man who dealt only with wine, our main waitress (who was nice & polite, didn't push anything on us), a fauxhawked waiter who made sure our water glasses were never more than half empty & who escorted me to the stairs of the bathroom, and a bald waiter who cleared our table & gave us new utensils for each course. We never had to call a waiter over for anything but they never lifted a plate before we were finished either.1st taste of the evening - pickled asparagus. No complaints.Appetizer - the Duck Gushtaba, which came out in the form of 3 small meatballs in sauce. Very soft & tender, just the perfect amount of spice for a girl who can't stand anything TOO spicy. Murg Makhanphal Kabab  (Sigri) - chicken cooked via open fire pit with avacado, ginger juice & cilantro. Really delicious & tender but with a nice slight char to the outside. I reccommend eating it as soon as it touches the table b/c as it cools, the crispness softens up (probably from the avacado puree).Monkfish Tikka (Tandoor) - I'm not a huge fish person but my bf is, & he liked this a lot. Very flavorful & well spiced. Served w/ what looks like sweet & tangy mango chutney that went really well with the fish. His only complaint was he wished they served more of the dark meat since he likes fattier cuts.Prune & Walnut Naan - perfect amount of sweetness, not oily or greasy at all. I've never had a sweet naan before, I think it's creative & well executed.Mango &  Pomegranate Lassi - Mango will forever be my favorite flavor but my boyfriend really liked the pomegranate (it's a bit runnier w/ a stronger flavor compared to the mango). Both had a dash of spice on top that went well with the flavors.Seasonal Trio of Kulfi - cardamon, mango & sour cherry. I immediately tried getting my spoon into the cardamon ASAP & it hadn't softened up yet, so all that happened was a loud clang as the kulfi cube made a flip on the plate. Within 2mins, our fauxhawked waiter presented me with a warmed knife atop a napkin, atop a plate. I was so surprised, I laughed out loud. Talk about good service. Anyway, all the flavors were very tasty, the texture was light & it ended the meal well. The check was presented with 2 chocolates & 2 soft berry gumdrops. The small touches were appreciated.This is the perfect spot for a date, seriously. My boyfriend told me about 3x how beautiful I looked, probably due to the soft glowy lighting. Plus, you'll definitely impress your date with the food & the decor. 5 stars, will come again to try other dishes.",3,0,0,A. V.,"New York, NY",6,38,11
2.0,7/11/2011,"Simply not impressed. I could have been here on an off night but it just didn't live up to my rather modest expectations.Walking in, I was stunned by the gorgeous decor. The hostess was really friendly and took us to our table. We were the only people in the whole restaurant for a while. Water glasses were filled within minutes of becoming half-full, warm towels were offered, and plenty of suggestions made.Once the place filled up the service certainly became less attentive, but our waiter still tried to get us to order way more food than we needed. I ordered the Bagarey Baigan. I wasn't exactly sure what form it would take but since eggplant, coconut, and peanuts were involved, I was intrigued. The result, however, was not tasty in the least and I couldn't finish. I say this as someone who loves anything Indian. To be honest, the best thing we had was the free taste of mango lassi.We had also ordered naan but weren't sure if we should get the regular variety or prune. (Prune sounded interesting but we weren't sure how it would taste with the other flavors of our dishes. It turned out to be very good, by the way.) The waiter said he could give us half regular and half prune. When we got our bill we saw that he had charged us for two orders of naan. We tried to clarify and mentioned that we thought he meant he'd bring one order with half regular and half prune. (We would've been willing to pay the higher price of an order of prune but wanted to have the option of the regular!) He wasn't at all accommodating and just acted as if we were stupid for even thinking that. So we ended up paying for two orders of naan, which was way more than we needed, being only two people.I should also mention that the employees' every move seemed to be scrutinized. It looked like they were under an immense amount of pressure that, for a place that is by no means four-star in my opinion, seemed unwarranted. When I get vibes like that, as a diner I get uncomfortable. If a customer notices that a restaurant seems like a terrible place to work, then there's something wrong.All in all, the food wasn't worth it, service was erratic, and the ambiance was strange.",1,2,0,J L.,"Washington, DC",1,24,0
4.0,7/6/2011,"Steven Tyler was bang on when he said how much he loves the sweet taste of India. The way Junoon does Indian food, I couldn't agree more.  What was the most pleasant surprise of the evening was that my main dish was just the right level of spice for me - I don't like spicy dishes.  I expected something that would set off a four-alarm fire in my mouth with the lamb kolhapuri.  It was most delicious. As an appetizer, I recommend the Hyderabadi Patthar Paneer and the Kakori Kabab.  We ordered two of the kabab to share between four people.  One order would have been sufficient.  It is a nice sized kabob, and had we only shared the one order, I would have had more more room to sample my dinner companions' dishes.The duck and venison were also excellent dishes.

3.0,6/24/2011,"Been wanting to check this place out for a while so my friend and I decided to splurge and go for it! My main mission was to find out: How does it size up next to Tamarind?Right before we headed over, i quickly searched yelp and saw that there's a $24 special (2 cocktails and an app) Sunday - Thursday. Should be noted that this special means the you have to have BOTH drinks and can't be shared with another person. Oops. Double Oops since we got there 20 mintues before our reservation time, and thought we could throwback a quick drink and an app for because of the deal. And so we decided to sit at the bar real quick. The woman at the front desk did not appreciate this. Mid pour of drink #2 she stomped over to us and said ""OH YOU DECIDED TO ORDER AT THE BAR?!?"" So we politely said we got a drink and would be ready in a bit. I felt like I was getting yelled at in kindergarden. Geez lady, I'm sorry and if you needed to give our table away, you should have done so. Appetizers were worth the scolding. :) Piri-Piri Shrimp and Murg Tikka Mirza Hasnu were both winners. Have never had chicken melt away in my mouth the way this did. YUM.When we were ready to be seated, angry lady made sure to disappear and stood outside while someone else took care of us. Gotta give her credit for excusing herself since she clearly was having trouble controlling her anger. Maybe she needs a new job? This could by no means be the worst thing a customer has done.Our dining experience was different. Our waiter changed three times, they may have been related to which course we were on. Unsure. We got the lobster tandoori (amazing) and the chicken korma (eh). For dessert, my friend wanted the date cake which she liked and I did not. Overall, nice lively ambiance. Our bartender was fun and nice. Waiter was fine. Food = 4.5 stars. Service = 3 stars. Maybe the nice bartender has friends that he can recommend for the other positions. Ask him. You never know.Junoon vs. Tamarind- creative drinks: Junoon- food: tough call.

I haven't really eaten too much Indian food, so maybe I'm not the best judge here. Dishes:Star anise scallop - what sounded like a great combo turned out oh so wrong. The anise just didn't meld well with the (3) scallops.  The scallops also weren't cooked with the same consistency - one was overcooked and the other was cooked just right. Lamb kabob - nothing special but decent. Wasn't too different from street meat. Halibut handi - the fish came fried(!!) and was very salty.  Why would anyone fry halibut!! This reminded me of McDonald's fish filet sandwich. I couldn't eat more than a few bites. I was crying on the inside for the poor halibut. Goat handi - best dish of the night. This is my first time trying goat meat and it tastes almost like beef - not gamey at all.  The naan was pretty good when eaten with the meat and curry. Kulfi (baan, mango, and mint) - this was all new to me except the mango flavored scoop which tasted like mango lassi.

These dishes are carefully prepared in an almost gourmet Indian fashion - This translates to absolutely delicious dishes.  The servings were not tremendous, but the flavor and preparation quality was top notch.Highly recommended for a high end meal or meeting, just know what you're going in for.  This is by no means an everyday casual dining experience.",3,0,1,Justin W.,"Manhattan, NY",130,141,29
2.0,6/11/2011,"Not impressed.Interior decor was exceptional but what we really cared about was the food. Between two of us we spent well over $200, but for what we got we wouldn't go back if it had been $100.Our cocktails were two-third crushed ice so by the third sip they tasted very watered down. Our waiter tried very hard to sell us the more expensive tasting menu citing that ""the only difference in cost is $25 per person and we would still getting all the things we wanted"". Complete lie. But we were dumb enough to listen to him.Appetizers:Deep fried spinach leaves drizzled with yogurt and chutney sauce. Wished we never had it. Batter was too thick, got soggy under the weight of the heavy sauces. Not sure why they bothered with the spinach at the first place. One would expect it to come out thin and crispy (at least I think that was the intention) but with the batter and sauces the dish almost made no sense.Tandoori Quail - Anyone who has ever cooked quail would know that quail by itself has a very natural and rich flavor - in essence its quite easy to do well. So while their quail was juicy, there was no wow factor. I was hoping that tandoori grilling would add another dimension to it, but honestly it tasted just like out of any oven.Mains:Tandoori chicken marinated in avocado - One of the better dishes we tried here. They use dark meats here. Not sure why, most tandoori chicken I have tried are white meats and still come out very juicy.Monkfish Tikka - Again we wouldn't say its bad, but just average. Fish was very fresh and broke off in flakes. But sauce was a bit weak and watery and didn't do much in enhancing or complementing with the flavor of the fish.Lamb Shank - meat was tendor but gravy was waaay too salty. You need half a naan to soak up a spoonful of the sauce.  Naans:Dates and walnut naan was very interesting and innovative I think. But it didn't come with our course and we had to ask for it. I thought they could do better with garlic naan. It was too oily and we could barely taste the garlic.Desserts:My wife had a spicy chocolate cake which was very tiny but tasted good. I had ice-cream float in rhubarb soup and it was exceptional.  Pistachio ice-cream with crushed pistachios and small hint of cardamom placed on top of what appeared to be thin almond cracker floating in a sweet and sour rhubarb soup. Excellent combination of ingredients and flavors. Absolutely divine. After Thoughts. Had it not for the desserts. This place deserves one star. Decor was nice but didn't feel that waiter was professional. He cajoled us to order more things than we could really stomach. Certain small things were extra charged and you realize only after the fact even though were were told in the beginning that it was an all-inclusive tasting menu.  All-in-all, an unsatisfying dining experience, and truly forgettable food (except for the desserts).",3,1,2,Sachin A.,"Jersey City, NJ",6,2,0

We had 8:30 reservations and we were seated promptly. The first table the hostess showed us was a bit crowded so I asked for another one. She very graciously gave us a 4-top. The sommelier immediately came to our table to see if he could help us with a selection. They have 2 wines from India on the list so I figured ""when in Rome""! I asked about them both and since they were out of the Shiraz the Cab it was! The sommelier was a bit hesitant when we asked about it but we decided to try it anyway. DELISH! It is the first vintage from this grower and I have to get the name of it...very different. The waiter suggested getting the tasting menu but we weren't all that hungry so we decided to order an appetizer and 2 entrees. I handed the task over to my date as he has lived in India and the menu was like nothing I've ever seen before. We started with the lamb kebobs that were almost like sausage...very good but not my fav. We then had the Goat and the Venison, Naan and rice. The Goat was spicy and delicious the venison, excellent. We had no less than 3 servers at all time, all extremely attentive. It turns out the Sommelier was from Nepal and my date, international man of mystery, had actually lived there too so they had a very nice chat.

4.0,6/7/2011,"Junoon had an excellent setting and it set the mood for a wonderful, elegant dinner. Aside from the location, everything about the restaurant was aesthetically gorgeous--the entrance, the hitchkas in the lounge, the reflecting pool, and the cozy table/bench we were at. The spice room near the rest rooms added a nice touch...overall the decor is elegant and not super cheesy. Definitely date worthy but not super romantic... Our group of five vegetarians dined on a Monday evening and they were very accommodating and flexible when it came to reservations (although It wasn't a particularly busy evening). All Indian restaurants need to give out hot towels like Junoon -- it should be required! Anyways the service was almost impeccable. The ""wine man"" was very courteous and helpful (not a snob like other places) and he was willing to work with us to recommend a great wine that was within our price range. To start off they brought out dhokla as an amuse-bouche (very tasty, great chutney, perfect texture!). For starters we ordered lasuni gobi, spinach chaat, and the hyderbadi paneer. The appetizers were slightly above average, gobi/paneer being the best and the palak chaat slightly disappointing. The wait staff did a great job with replenishing wine and dinner ware after each course. For the main course we ordered kofte and paneer, dal makhani, raita, naan, and onion relish. Everything was super delicious and the subtleties of certain flavors were the most impressive. Nothing was too overpowering in terms of flavor and spice. Both dishes were VERY tasty -- the dal makhani however was a bit too heavy and creamy for my liking but nonetheless a great accompaniment to the main dishes. the raita is a MUST (mint and pomegranate is a welcome surprise!). For dessert we got the kulfi trio and as full as we were, we took the whole plate down. We had cardamon, mango, and PAAN flavor. All were amazing but the paan kulfi blew our minds! yum. they gave us a complimentary dessert as well!  One Bottle + food order = $50/head.  I'd say that's pretty reasonable!i will definitely 100% dine again -- amazing new addition to the nyc restaurant scene.

4.0,5/28/2011,"From the moment you enter this beautifully designed one of a kind, chic, Indian theme restaurant fit for an In Style promotional event, your expectations have already been set for the ultimate dining experience. I made a reservation with a couple of friends last week and was fortunate enough to dodge the line going down the block and wrapped around the corner. The custom carved walls and canopy coaches gave an authentic feel recreating what a high resturant might appear like in India!  This was a refreshing change from all of the cheap commericalized attempts featuring giant elephants, plug in water fountains, and immitation gold, most reminicient in niehborhood hooka bars. I found the staff to be very polite and hospitibal, our host checked up on the table a few minutes before we were even ready to order. We started off with a round of some of their speciality cocktails.  I started off with duck dish and yogurt that I split with everyone at the table and then had this amazing lamb dish for dinner. Now honestly I have had my share of lamb dinners and have visited quite a few indian resturants in my day so ideally this is wear I would prefer to eat lamb. However, after experiencing Junnon's version of preparing a dish called DahiWala Lamb Chops, I don't think any other place could make it as good. By 11:00pm this place was already packed and it was a week night.  Waiters could be seen dashing back and forth trying to fill orders immidiately, so after a while if I wanted to order anything else after our hostest left it was pretty much a long shot.

4.0,5/9/2011,"Oh, Junoon.My disclaimer is this- I think Junoon does what they do exceptionally well, and that's why I like this place- it's just the combination of fine details that end up coming together that feel... well, a bit awkward.Junoon is an example of fine dining, NYC style- and they serve Indian food. Period. I came here for my birthday dinner with my simple indian parents, who can be a tad picky. I thought it would be a perfect treat for all of us- a chance to sample buzzworthy cuisine for me, and for my parents the comfort of eating their go to meal. That's where it got funny- Real Indians are less concerned with how intricate the place settings are, how fast a napkin gets folded when you leave the table, or whether or not your wine glass is prepped before they serve the wine. But that's really what Junoon is good at- fine attention to detail, and service so quick and on point, you wonder if the bussers have ever worked at Wimbledon, as your utensils seem to vanish and reappear clean the second you put them down. When you enter, you're guided through a long corridor embellished with black marble water basins, tall ivory carved barriers, and dark wood floors. Impressive, truthfully. You're then sat at a table large enough to comfortably handle a family style dinner, and yet give you enough room to wish you had a microphone. The sommelier cheerfully tries to walk you down the wine menu- pointing out which wines go with which type of meal you're planning to have. He's also quite impressive with his knowledge, I just wish he would have given us a second to sit down! Finally, you make your decision of a bottle worth somewhere between $40-400, and he preps the glass. My father's reaction- ""why did he give me a dirty glass?"" We're then presented with an amuse bouche of a teeny tiny piece of dhokla (a traditionally simple dish), with a swiggle of chutney on the plate. My mom wonders why they gave that to us, and why in the world they would give us something so small! (Ha, ha).We started off with the ""palak patti ki chat"" and the ""tree of life cauliflower"". The chat wasn't really what we're used to from chat- but rather single pieces of spinach deep fried in a crispy shell and drizzled with tamarind chutney and yogurt. The tree of life- was a cross section of a cauliflower head, fried bhajji style and served on a plate with a sauce oddly similar to Siracha hot sauce. Dinner we ordered family style, as we've come to expect from Indian places, but found that the portions were small enough here to demand sampling from a decent amount of dishes. Saag Aur Gobi Ki Burji- a super garlicky dish of cauliflower and spinach- quite tasty, but was a tad on the oily side. This was probably the only dish that wasn't demolished.Bagarey Baigan- mini eggplant in a lightly colored tamarind, coconut and peanut curry. I wasn't as impressed with the eggplant, but the sauce was pretty well done.Amritsari Aloo Wadi- potatoes filled with a lentil and sundried tomato mixture, in a ginger curry- moving up there in my favorites for the night.Nadru Kofte- Vikas Khanna's take on the traditional Malai Kofta, except this time is a bit sweeter and garnished with fried lotus roots. The sauce was exceptional in this case- and is possibly my favorite dish of the night. We ended up ordering 2 of these.While we were a mainly vegetarian group- the carnivores of the group sampled the Goat Matke Wala. This was found to be rather enjoyable, and also the spiciest dish of the night, but could have done more with less fatty goat pieces.Dessert was also worth trying- the sampler of kulfi cubes, and the chai spiced cake with orange creamsicle ice cream were lovely. They topped the ice cream with a small cookie that had ""happy birthday"" elegantly scripted across. It's a definite plus that the fanciness of Junoon isn't above a birthday celebration!The best thing about Junoon is the service and the attention to detail. The food is tasty, puts up a fair fight for noteworthy Indian food in Manhattan, but honestly not anywhere off the island. (Manhattan isn't known for great Indian food.) The truth is that you're buying $7 naans for the experience of eating there- and not for mind blowing creativity or authenticity of the dishes, as you can find food just as good elsewhere. I like the concept, and I like the execution, but I'd probably more prefer to eat there with a date (who was paying) rather than my simple minded Indian parents who are more concerned with quality and quantity of their meal than the strategic placing of their dinner napkin.",10,3,3,Rajani M.,"New York, NY",133,164,10

3.0,4/30/2011,"I have been eyeballing Junoon for some time, usually when circling the block trying to find a legal parking space so I can run into Eataly for an espresso.  Then, all of a sudden, Junoon seems like it's everywhere... so i had to come in for a visit.  The space is just lovely- cavernous and tasteful with East Indian accents and arches swathed in soft light.  The service is attentive and pleasant.  The opulent space between tables is more than average for NYC and there seems to be plenty of spots for larger groups throughout the multi-segmented dining areas.But, the food is what is always most important to me, and in that department I was a bit disappointed.  The execution did not command the prices.  The ""tree of life"" cauliflower ($10) had a zingy tomato sauce that was tasty but the breaded cauliflower itself could have been a soggy filleted knish.  If this is the tree of life, one better be hoping for afterlife.When I traveled in India, my favorite foods were from Mumbai to the south.  As southern Indian dishes seem to be rare in NYC, I was excited to try the Goan shrimp appetizer (""piri piri""--$14); however, the four shrimp were tough and rubbery- extremely overcooked- and spoiled the rest of the dish.  This, in my book, is inexcusable, as shrimp are extremely easy to cook (and get right).  I would not expect inattention to such an obvious detail even in a subterranean dive on 6th street.For us, the servings were ample, but I think most folks might consider the portions puny for the price.  The monkfish tikka ($26) was probably the best thing we sampled.  The sauce was sop-worthy and the fruity yet spicy garnish was delicious.  The entree of baby eggplants in a peanut-tamarind-curry-coconut sauce ($18) left me underwhelmed.  Naan (plain at $5 and garlic at $7) was good but significantly overpriced.  The wine list could be improved by offering a few more lower priced by-the-glass options.  Of the couple cheaper options, I found the rose' from Provence ($10) to be a tasty complement to the spicy food.  Junoon seems to fall into a camp of a handful of NYC spots that offer elevated Indian fusion.  In short, I would say Junoon's menu is a tad better than Tamarind and Devi but falls well short of the consistency and quality of Graffiti's offerings.  At Junoon, the ample space is lovely, the service is good, and the food just varied enough and just good enough for me to possibly want to try again (but next time I will avoid the shrimp and cauliflower appetizers).  A relatively modest dinner for two with a total of 3 glasses of wine, two appetizers and two entrees (but no dessert) ran just a hair under $150.  Pricey for what it is.",2,2,1,Jason N.,"New York, NY",307,671,1117

4.0,4/28/2011,"I've been a fan of Vikas Khanna for awhile now, especially after his appearances with Gordon Ramsey. So my friends and I made a reservation for 9PM on a Wednesday. We were in awe when we walked into the restaurant it was beautifully decorated,  felt like I was in India! We were greeted by a polite hostess who escorted us to the lounge to wait while our table was getting ready. Normally this sort of thing ticks me off bc if I go to the trouble of making a reservation and getting to the restaurant on time I expect to be promptly seated upon arrival. BUT, I was eager to try to the cocktails so I didn't mind. My party sat in the lounge for an hour waiting for our table and we sipped on the aromatic apricot (if you are a fan of gin this is a must try).Finally around 10 PM we were seated at our table. The restaurant was pretty packed at this point and to be honest, the service was a bit slow BUT! The food did indeed make up for this. We ordered the following, Appetizers: Tree Of Life  Cauliflower - Basically fried cauliflower with spices - pretty mild to my tongue but good overall Murg Tikka Mirza Hasnu -Fantastic! Kakori Kebab - This was a duck marinated in yogurt sauce of some sort, it tasted cardboardy to me so steer clear. Dinner: DahiWala Lamb Chops Lobster TandooriNadru KofteMurg WajidDinner was a A+++ in my book. Everything was spectacular, the flavors were just perfect. The Lobster Tandoori blew my mind. Dessert: Spiced Chocolate Cake - Was good but the ice cream that was paired with this was what really set this apart. Seasonal Trio of Kulfi -  A MUST TRY! The Paan ice cream was amazing. I've never had Paan ice cream before but have been craving it ever since. Date Pudding Cake - meh, pass on this. Unless you like bitter desserts. The best part of the night was when we asked to give our compliments to the Chef - a humble Vikas Khanna emerged and thanked us graciously. He apologized for the wait and even gifted us his food documentary Holy Kitchens. Definitely try this restaurant out its worth the $$$",1,0,0,Aditi S.,"Manhattan, NY",12,59,1

4.0,4/14/2011,"You wonder what's happening when a restaurant has 24 reviews, but 31 have been filtered previously: who's real? who's not?It was a surprise to see that only 3 Elite yelpers had reviewed Junoon before me, despite the glowing Two Star review by NY Times. It WAS re-assuring that all three had given Junoon 5 stars. But, I got a good laugh from reading some of the more ""artfully"" done reviews - including one lamenting the waste of $200 at a meal where his GF spent all the time looking behind him at ""The Hottest Chef in New York""! It wasn't a surprise to see today that the review had ended up getting filtered  :) So, bet you didn't know that Vikas Khanna was voted hottest chef in New York. That's one of the three links on the restaurant's home page, the other two being the Two Star reviews by the New York Times and New York Magazine. While I would not expect to see ""Hottest Chef"" (not ""Top Chef"" mind you) featured on the website for Daniel, it obviously works for Junoon given the predominantly female clientele on a weekday.Thankfully, the quality of the cooking would set at rest any fears that Mr. Khanna is there solely for his good looks. Both he and the restaurant deliver while walking a fine line. The opulent landscape and pomp may border on excess (it's still an able contrast from restaurant premises where the air has been permeated by the aroma of spices), but the restaurant redeems itself by the quality of its attentive service. As my hand reflexively stretched towards cleaning the table cloth of a spot, a server appeared from nowhere comforting me that he would take care of it. Top notch.The food sparkles when it's innovative, and aims to dazzle by transforming the mundane. From the complimentary palate cleansing cold drink Thandai (saffron, ground almonds), to the Paan Kulfi that is the highlight of the trio of Kulfis (Caramel and Mango being the other flavors), you start and end your meal on a high note. This has been thoughtfully planned as many people in the Indian subcontinent end by the meal with Paan, if not with dessert, and combining the two is pure genius!There are other moments of unadulterated joy: the Piri-Piri shrimp reminds one of the best of Goan cuisine, the shrimp may be small but the rich, fiery sauce is delectable. The Kakori Kabab (finely minced lamb, cardamom, spiced yogurt) is of a melt-in-the-mouth texture thanks to the use of green papaya. Similarly the Dahiwale Lamb Chops (yogurt, ginger, cardamom) are tender and well charred, and perhaps the best I've eaten in an Indian restaurant. However, there are misses as well: the bread basket was a mess of soft, oily naans and parathas; the Hyderabadi Patthar Paneer was dominated by the taste of turmeric and cooled too soon; while the much hyped handi dishes: Chicken Malvan (coconut, green chilies, cilantro) and Goat Matke wala (garlic, bay leaf) only hinted at heat and layered complexity. The kitchen consciously prefers white and black pepper to their hotter cousins, and while not numbing down the spice completely (and aspiring for fusion) to the tune of a Tabla, does not scale the heights of Tamarind - which similarly targets an eclectic clientele, with a better executed cocktail selection, but is additionally frequented by many more Indian regulars seeking an authentic, even if upscale experience.I am unconvinced that Junoon can differentiate itself from other Indian restaurants by virtue of the Five elements, rather methods of cooking (Tandoor, Sigri, Haandi, Tawa, and Patthar), that it highlights in its menu. Where it does do extremely well is by carving a space for itself between two distinct classes of Indian restaurants: one which boasts of ""Tandoori Chicken and Saag Paneer"", while the other speaks to ""Grilled scallops with orange marmalade and roasted pepper chutney"".   But, when the time comes to shout ""as good as it gets"", it does not help that the hottest thing announced by Junoon, is the chef. That does not cut it for me.",19,12,20,Atif I.,"New York, NY",177,642,1772
5.0,4/11/2011,"I have enjoyed Vikas' cooking for many years now.  At his previous restaurant it was more of a traditional North Indian meal. I first enjoyed his pan kulfi, which was a fusion of East and West at his previous restaurant and since that day I was waiting to see when he would open up an India restaurant that combines the essence of the spices and tastes of Indian food with the quality of top grade American meat, poultry, fish, and veggies.  I practically go there every week if not every other week.  So yes...I highly recommend Junoon.",0,0,0,Al L.,"Munich, Germany",18,22,2

Their  menu is expansive ranging from different meats, poultry, and fish. They brand their menu around the different vehicles they use to cook their food. It's actually really different and clever. We had the paneer akbari, and I believe the sookhi subzi (with a ton of naan -yumm) Normally, I never opt to get desert but we had a warm coffee crusted chocolate eclair with a side of chai ice cream. DELICIOUS.I was delightfully satisfied and would definitely return here with some good family and friends.

The spiced chocolate cake with chai ice cream was exceptional. The ice cream, in particular was wonderfully flavoured - I've never had ice cream like this before. The restaurant also has a surprisingly long wine list with quite a few affordable options. The sommelier was very helpful.

4.0,4/2/2011,"The hinted ostentatious of Junoon has an unexpected warmth. The food follows suit. Gandhi wouldn't eat here, but Ben Kingsley might. The price could be much higher considering the generous hospitality and thoughtfully flavored dishes. The names are atypical of most Indian menus. It's not fusion as much as the chef simply taking educated risks in blending spices, sauces and preparation methods (i.e. Stone-cooked lamb shoulder with papaya juice, garam masala, and dried ginger)Initial Reaction: Ah, this is what ""dimly lit"" means...Food: Terrific. Go with the Bagarey Baigan; the meatiness of the baby eggplant in a thick, almost thai-like curry was a welcome surprise.Service: A planned, well-executed series of steps where waiters and staff take very good care of you (and your utensils).

The food was flavored just right and Oh, so Tasty! The service was above the bar...waaay above the bar. You have the wait staff serving you and anticipating your needs every second. If we dripped a bit of sauce on the table, they were right there to cover it up with a small napkin that blocked the stain from getting onto clothing; assisted seating every time you got up; escort to the bathroom area; complimentary coat check; your napkin was refolded for you until  you returned; french-style serving of the meal; awesome knowledge of wine and their pairing with the foods; equally awesome knowledge of the dishes and the ingredients; Water was kept flowing even if the glass was quarter-way empty; the ambiance was very romantic. Open kitchen and low light along with a very modern decor (simple but chic) gave this restaurant a powerful look. Most people were dressed casual to smart-casual. I wore jeans and a camel sweater  with a scarf tied around my neck in a knot and suede shoes, while my partner also had jeans and a sweater on along with Steve Madden sneakers. The table next to us had on a dinner jacket and blue jeans with loafers. Anything goes. We dined on a shrimp appetizer and simple salad to start, that was followed by the Korma chicken dish and Sea Bass. Basmati rice and naan bread with 3 different chutneys (Mango, coriander, and pistachio-Prune). Surprisingly the pistachio prune was a winner followed by the Mango.
