Also, diner behind me felt food was undercooked. 3 separate staff members came over to debate the point with him. To his credit the customer kept his cool and just insisted it was underdone.

2.0,4/8/2019,"Great little place for a home style Italian meal. The ambiance was nice, the wait staff attentive, and the food was good (wish the calamari wasn't as chewy).  BUT be careful when you sign your receipts though.  The bill they brought me initially was $152.97 (for a party of 3, 2 adults and 1 child). I gave them my credit card and they charged it $230.82 and that wasn't including tip.  So somehow the bill turned from $152.97 to $230, and b/c I was in the middle of talking at the table, I almost gave them a 20% tip on top of the incorrect $230.  Luckily, I realized that they added a $45 bottle of Chardonnay to my bill! (which we had never ordered; we only had 2 cocktails). the $45 bottle of Chardonnay was mixed in with all the dishes we ordered, and when I told them about it, the waiter said he gave me the wrong bill.  But how could it be the wrong bill if it had the same other items we had ordered during our meal?  It was definitely a little too sketchy for me.  Then when I got home, I noticed another error, they cocktails were listed as $14/cocktail, but I was charged $15/cocktail.  Review your bill line-item-by-line-item and confirm that the price on the menu is what you were charged.",0,0,0,Rita S.,"New York, NY",47,33,16

Start with an assorted basket of chilled breads and wonderful cracker-like breadsticks with sesame seeds. I started my luncheon with a bowl of the ""soup of the day"" which was some sort of white beans with pasta ($7.95) - this was a large bowl of soup and quite tasty. For my entree,  I chose the Fettucine Bolognese from the lunch menu ($12.00); a  generous portion and delicious!

Service & Staff was outstanding. We had several appetizers & everything was delicious . The Veal Piccata was so tender you could cut it with a fork. The Bronzino was one of the best with a perfectly cooked rice. The Rib Eye Steak was huge & delicious. We finished our meals with ice cream & Lava Cake.

5.0,1/19/2019,"I hadn't been back to NY in over 7 years and this time, it was for a business meeting. My fiancé joined me and to help give him a crash course in some of NY's best eats, we had dinner at Il Cortile. From the food to the service, everything was amazing. Our waiter was Vincenzo and it's clear that service and this community is in his blood. We watched him cheer up a crying little girl at a table across from ours with a Shirley Temple (and extra cherries), making jokes until her tears faded away. When my fiancé's muscles came, he insisted he take a piece of toast from the bread basket and let it soak in the broth for a few minutes and then eat it to really be blown away...even calling my fiancé his ""son from another woman"". And when an obnoxious patron complained about a dish he swore he ordered 10 years ago that had cream in it now didn't, Vincenzo was nothing but a gentleman and polite and handled an uncomfortable situation with class and dignity, even making a point to personally walk over to each table who still had patrons at them and apologize. The food: outstanding. My chicken parm was definitely hand-pounded and breaded perfectly. The cheese phenomenal and the sauce...if I could have put it in my pockets to bring back home on my flight, I would have!  My favorite, the buratta app with roasted pears we started with. Salty and sweat with balsamic vinegar. My only regret...we didn't save room for dessert!",1,0,0,Dana S.,"Wake Forest, NC",131,3,0

1.0,1/11/2019,"Came here a few times and the food is mediocre at best but I absolutely won't be returning after the way the hostess treated my party when I went there recently. We made a reservation hours earlier and called to confirm and she said we were good. We show up and there is a line and we finally get to the hostess and she said there is no record of our reservation. As we attempt to explain to her how we called earlier she gave us a serious attitude and said things like ""why are you mad? Look at her face."" It was so rude that the people behind heard it and left. Byou can tell this isnt the first time she has treated customers like this. After insulting us and being snotty we left and got dinner at the restaurant next store which was much better anyway. Listen if your service is garbage at least make up for it with the food.

1.0,12/22/2018,"This is hands down one of the worst establishments I have ever been to. My reservation was for 7:30 p.m. and I was told my table would be ready in 5-10 minutes and that they overbooked for the evening. I watched 4-5 tables being sat who had reservation times after mine! When I asked the host for the 2nd time I was assured that the table was being prepared. I then watched a reservation for 8:05 be seated while I was still waiting. I then told her that it was absurd that I had a 7:30 reservation and it was now 8:10 and I was still waiting. We watched the 8:05 reservation (patron) hand the host a $20 bill! This is insane. I left with my girlfriend and when we were leaving we did not even get a ""Sorry"" for the time I wasted standing in their establishment. I was always a Angelos on Mulberry patron and when they open back up I will recommend Angelos to everyone I come in contact with.

So if you enjoy being served at a restaurant and you're new to this place, then you should avoid it unless you come at an odd hour.Came here previously and had a good experience, but came here again with my friends to show them some good Italian food, and was extremely disappointed. Me and a couple other groups were waiting to be seated or to be put on a list, and literally 3 new groups passed us up. Not only that, but the hostess gave the front group attitude for inquiring about why these other groups passed us.

We pretty much sat behind where they had the DJ. So much for a romantic dinner. I'm almost suspecting they did this because we are younger (late 20s) and we were dressed pretty casually (jeans and t-shirts). Despite our seating issue, the food really was perfect.

5.0,12/14/2018,"For my daughter's 21st birthday she wanted to dine at a nice restaurant in little Italy. Il Cortile was highly recommended by a friend. It was definitely worth the trip into the city. When we arrived they seemed somewhat busy and we were seated immediately to another room where there were still some tables available. The décor was typical to a upscale Italian Restaurant decorated nicely for the Holidays. It a had very warm and comfortable feel to it. Our waiter -came over and welcomed us. We first ordered a bottle of Prosecco for a birthday toast. We skipped the apps because we heard the portions were healthy. My wife and I ordered the Capellini Piselli e Prosciutto Speciali, (Capellini with meat sauce, tomatoes, prosciutto, mushroom, peas & cream), The birthday girl ordered the Chicken Parmigiana, hey boyfriend had the Pepite di Gnocchi (Potato dough stuffed with chicken, spinach & mascarpone), and my other daughter had the Rigatoni ""Principe di Napoli"" (""Prince of Naples"" rigatoni with filetto di pomodoro, prosciutto & Mozzarella). All our meals were delicious and plentiful, most of us could not finish our dinners. Then they gave the birthday girl a complimentary desert, a small portion of Tiramisu. She said it was awesome.Throughout dinner a local band came in and played happy birthday to those celebrating birthdays and Christmas Carols to each table. A very nice touch to the evening. Could have not been better if we had planned it. Just perfect. ,",16,6,20,Frank M.,"New Hyde Park, NY",210,159,1476
5.0,12/13/2018,"Best Italian dining experience I've ever had. This lovely restaurant in the heart of Little Italy is absolutely amazing. The atmosphere, the gorgeous interior, the little courtyard seating in the back--it's all so beautifully done that you don't feel like the grunge of the lower Manhattan streets are just beyond that window. For a moment you're simply in Italy, the way it was remembered by the founders of the restaurant.I'm quite sure now that all Italian food I've eaten before this visit was made with over processed commercial sauces and nothing done from scratch, especially Olive Garden, I still to this day have no idea how people eat there. But here... I'm quite confident that the older Italian gentleman that owns the place would serve nothing less than dishes that matched the authenticity of his passion for them. It was so good, I didn't want to forget what I ate so my friend and I both took menus home with us to Hawaii.Normally, I have to add a little acidity to almost every pasta I order here in Hawaii by asking for lemons. Hawaii people for some reason like their pasta and meats sweet and I've even seen someone put sugar in their spaghetti sauce (what is wrong with you lol). But in this authentic Italian restaurant, I wanted to make sure I tasted the food before adding anything at all and when I did ...oh... it was magnifico. It needed nothing extra at all. Rich. Creamy. Flavorful and Al dente. I still dream about their food lol.As for service, it was just as wonderful as the food and atmosphere. Waiters were very formal and polite and the owner was just a joy to meet and converse with. He was very funny and so welcoming, it really topped off the whole experience.Hec, even the other diners were a delight--there was a man finishing his visit when we were getting seated who teased the owner about how did he get these lovely ladies to come in here (secret: we weren't solicited in, we actually picked it before hand thanks to Yelp!, teehee~). I mean what more could you want from an authentic Italian restaurant than amazing food, a beautiful interior, and cute guys that refer to you as lovely ladies on their way out? :P",0,0,1,TaraMarie P.,"Waianae, HI",244,330,224

4.0,12/4/2018,"The start to our experience was horrible. We had reservations for a party of 8 for 7pm. We waited along with many other customers as we were told our table would be ready in just a minute.  We were told this ""several"" times. Then about 40 minutes into our wait we were offered to wait in their lounge where there were places we could sit. Ummm nope, no seats available. So we stood. Then 30 minutes later they came to seat us. We would have left earlier but with a party of 8 we knew we would not find another spot to eat at that point. Once we sat down and were waited on by a superb waitstaff the entire night turned around. We had a wonderful waiter and busboy. The food was spectacular and came out in a very timely fashion. If we didn't have such a horrible experience with waiting over an hour (as did many of the other customers with reservations did) I would have given 5 stars. They really need to figure out the reservations as it appears that they were not combing the online reservations with the called in reservations. It was a mess and the hostess had no idea what was going on. She asked us roughly 7 times what our name was and how many in our group.

Once we sat down the waiter told us that there would have to be 4 people on each check. Not optimal but workable. We checked again regarding using credit cards and were told we could. The meal was good enough, but nothing special. Bottles of wine kept coming to the table and being opened. At first we thought someone had ordered them but when the bill came we realized these $75 bottles of wine had not been ordered by anyone in our party. When the bill came it was one consolidated bill and the waiter told us no credit cards, cash only. Questioning the waiter- who was brisk and impolite throughout the meal- was of no value since he feigned ignorance and incomprehension of our concerns and questions though it was obvious he did understand us. Since we thought someone in our party ordered the wine, we drank it, so we felt we had to pay for it, though no one in our group would ever buy one $75 bottle of wine, much less several. We did not make a scene and paid the bill despite the fact that several people in our party had to go to an ATM machine to get cash.

The entrees did not come with any sides.Overall this restaurant was a disappointment based on the indifferent ""by the glass"" bar wine options, table service, entree availability, and value (six shrimp for $25?).  The entrees were well prepared and delicious but I can not recommend this restaurant or support a higher rating based on our experience.",0,0,0,William N.,"The Villages, FL",0,10,0

We started with the burrata and eggplant rollatine, which was followed by penne alla vodka, chicken Francese, and capellini with tomato, meat sauce, prosciutto, mushrooms, peas & cream - our favorite dish!

1.0,9/20/2018,"Me and my 2 girlfriends went to the Italian festival that was going on. We were in finding somewhere to hang out. When we stopped by Buona Notte, we were greeted by the manager who was a middle aged man he seemed very friendly and welcoming, so we went in. This is the same manager to Il Cortile. The restaurant was empty. They took us all the way to the back and started pouring us shots. We thought this was nice and then they asked us to sit down at a table. We did. They gave us more drinks nobody ordered. They asked if we wanted to order food and we said we would take a look at a menu. We all agreed that we would share one calamari appetizer. Then they started serving us a bread dish, again something we didn't ask for and assumed it was on the house. The entire time it was the one manager demanding his staff to do all this, to which they looked like they didn't want to but they did anyway since the manager said so. Eventually the food was taking too long, it was getting a little weird hanging out and drinking with older men we didn't really know, so we decided to go ride one of the carnival rides. the manager followed us. before we got off, we saw that he had called over three officers saying we didn't pay our bill. To us, it seemed like everything was on the house except for the calamari, which we had never received. Reluctantly, we agreed to pay the bill. two of us work in food service, so we would never dine and dash. When we got back to the restaurant, they scrambled together a bill that had the calamari and a Fish entree we absolutely never ordered. They weren't able to charge us for any drinks since they hadn't checked our ID's. How embarrassing for them. In addition to that, we never received the calamari. We would have rather paid for the things we consumed than paying for items on this fabricated bill. We tried to argue it, they tried to force us to take the fish that we didn't order to-go but we wouldn't take it. Eventually the police came in and forced us to leave. This is not a good way to run a business. I hope if anyone considers going here, you'll consider our incident with the creepy manager.",1,0,0,Kelsey C.,"Manhattan, NY",0,5,0

I made reservations for 8 pm (August , a. Sunday ), but to our surprise, the place was barely filled . We went there anyway (even though other places seemed to be more popular ) because of the face they have an air conditioned garden , and the reviews I had seen.

We ordered a veal puttanesca which wasn't on the me ur but they offered to make it , and sautéed seafood ,The veal was tender but too bland ( lacking garlic), and my seafood dish was fresh but equally bland.

Whenever I drive down from Rochester, we always try to meet in the city for a meal, and my uncle is fond of this place. The dining area is large, we can always get seated at any time despite no reservation, food is solid, and it is quiet enough for us to have a conversation. On my most recent visit we shared a variety of dishes for a late lunch/early dinner: --appetizer 1: giant polpetta (meatball) in tomato sauce (4 of us eating; each had a good size chunk)--appetizer 2: avocado bruschetta toast, with blue cheese crumbles and balsamic drizzle (holy crap was that good!)--dish 1: Lobster Ravioli (my husband and I split this and I'm glad we did because each half was still large; sauce was awesome; ravioli were fresh made and there were lots of large pieces of lobster)--dish 2: veal scallopini (5 large pieces of veal in the rich sauce - my uncle finished this all on his own!)--dish 3: eggplant rollatini (we expected this to be one of the smaller mains, but it was huge! The thinly sliced eggplant was rolled with herbs and smothered in cheese and sauce and roasted - it is definitely something that should always be on the table!)All of the food was luscious. The combination of rich flavors, the portion sizes, everything was very pleasing. Despite us thinking there would be left overs, we finished everything off, plus had dessert and coffees.....and then proceeded outside to walk for several blocks in the snow to try to digest! To the other reviewers, yes, the atmosphere here is a little dated, but to us, it's like going back in time to the late 1970s or early 1980s; there's a focus on comfort and a homey quality to the atmosphere. And I love that the waiters are all Italian and speak Italian (and generously humored me as I practiced my nascent Italian language skills while ordering....) Why only the 4 stars? I realize this is NYC and everything is ala cart, but I think diners should get a small salad as part of the meal when they are spending $25 or more per plate.

I asked about the garden area and the manager, with an attitude, said it's full, you'll have to wait an hour for it. Not even a pleasant smile. Even though, I specifically picked this restaurant for the garden seating, my group could not sit there. Fine, so on to the food. It was just ok. I've had better & more authentic Italian food at other places. The glasses of wine were about $10 so we decided to get a bottle instead of the same type of red wine.

3.0,12/27/2017,"Went to this restaurant for lunch yesterday, a very cold day, the day after Christmas.  The food was good, the roasted vegetable appetizer very good.  But I have to comment, somewhat negatively, on the service.  The waiter brought our main courses when we hadn't all even finished with the appetizers.  He pushed the appetizer plates one side and set the dinner plates in front of us.  I can understand his doing this if the restaurant were crowded and there were people waiting outside to get in; the restaurant would want to turn the tables over as soon as possible, or perhaps it would be hectic in the kitchen and hard to time the dishes closely.  (I can easily imagine this happening in the summer.  This place is located in the heart of Little Italy, which gets a lot of tourists.) But the restaurant wasn't crowded at all.  I didn't feel that we were being hustled out, but it was a bit jarring to have the second course arrive so soon.  They were very nice when we asked to change our table, though, soon after we sat down.  There was a table of 10 men being seated simultaneously right next to us, and we thought they'd be pretty loud.   The staff immediately moved us to a different dining room that was much quieter.",0,0,0,Nora C.,"Manhattan, NY",0,17,0

The lobster bisque soup is outstanding and all the pasta is homemade. Try to remember if you order seafood with pasta please refuse the cheese, it's proof you don't know how to eat real Italian.The veal will melt in your mouth and the pasta with clams is crazy good.I don't understand the 3 and a half stars, the is a full 5 star quality restaurant. Maybe someone didn't like the waiter or something.A real Italian is known by the way they order and sometimes it's very easy to offend a staff member.

You may even run into a celebrity or two it's definitely a favorite of the mob wives and was also used on an episode of the Sopranos.I'm not saying that these fictional shows are a statement that this is the best of the best, but If it's being used as a backdrop and representation of where real Italians are going for good Italian food you have to take that into consideration enjoy your dinner.",0,1,1,Anthony C.,"Logan Township, NJ",0,37,24

Our entrees were good. Our daughter who had ordered a Sprite had problems getting a refill. Not sure why as that's not a tough one to mess up.

5.0,6/4/2017,"I stumbled upon Little Italy while doing my touristy shopping in Chinatown, and suddenly, I had a craving for gnocchi, my favorite pasta. When in Rome, right? [sorry, I had to] I decide to investigate the menu outside of Il Cortile. The host/""recruiter"" spotted me and proceeded to convince me to dine within. He was not knowledgable of their menu, but he assured me that my server could accommodate me. I asked about the price point after seeing that most entrees were over $20. I am not a meat eater, so I was hoping I wouldn't have to spend like one. He then offered to include a glass of wine with my meal price, and I was sold. The restaurant was entirely empty, so everyone perked up when I walked in. I was offered any seat in the dining room, but insisted that they seat me wherever would be convenient for a 1 top. My server asked my wine preference, and I went with the Chardonnay. I asked the server if they would, in fact, create a meal for me since the host was not reassuring. I was told ""of course"" and ordered a meatless gnocchi with vodka sauce and mushrooms I received a whole bread basket for myself, which I barely made a dent in. I cannot comment on how long it took for my entree to come out, but I was not concerned. Not starving, not in a hurry, plus it was a special request. At this point, many more customers began to come in. The server brought my meal out, and it was exactly what I wanted! He offered grated Parmesan and left me to enjoy my potato pasta meal. The gnocchi didn't LOOK like the classic fold with the fork mark, but it tasted just the same. The chef also decided to include onions, which was risky, as I do not love onions. Maybe vodka sauce comes with onions, and I did not know? Whatever the reason, it turned out okay because I could not taste them. I could not eat the entire meal, but I did my best! My server came to check on me, and I informed him that I was done. I was offered coffee and dessert, but I politely declined. I did expect the check to be brought to me directly following that conversation, but perhaps there was a miscommunication. Two other employees came to me separately to ask if I was waiting on coffee, and I told them each that I'd just like to pay my bill. After probably 15 minutes, my server brought my receipt of $19.60, and I happily paid my bill. Overall, it was very pleasant: good food, decent service (until the very end, but I understand he had more tables at that point), and an agreeable price. 10/10 would recommend!",0,0,0,Hannah B.,"New York, NY",1,3,0

It arrived drenched in a red sauce and tomatoes. I wasn't expecting white wine and garlic to be red. Mediocre food aside, when we asked for our bill, the waiter brought over only the credit card slip (with an empty space for gratuity). No detailed receipt. As we were trying to figure out the gratuity, we realized we were a large party and most of the time, a tip should be included automatically with large parties. We then asked our dishonest waiter for the actual detailed bill and we saw that gratuity was in fact included - he was just trying to get tipped twice. Never again.

During this time, we were offered drinks and appetizers. We all had sangria which was actually amazing! We didn't have appetizers until we settled at our table. They took us to a large round table closer to the front of the restaurant in a somewhat private room. The round table was great for such a large group because we can all see each other and communicate together. We ordered an appetizer sampler and they brought out multiple different traditional Italian dishes which were all amazing! Can't forget to mention how amazing the bread baskets were! For my main course I shared the lobster ravioli and Caesar salad with my boyfriend and we were so impressed! Pretty much all of the food here was amazing (please refer to my pics).A little Italian band/group came to our room and played and sang a couple of songs for our table and a few other tables in the room.

I loved the risotto but was disappointed to oinly see two little shrimp pieces on such an expensive dish - which there was more, so that it could be reflected through their advertisement for it. the place was packed with tourists as well, since the sans genaro feast was still going on. i probably wouldnt go out of my way to go back but if i was in the area, but i wasnt entirely disappointed.",0,0,0,Wesleyan T.,"Brooklyn, NY",445,354,29

The lobster ravioli had homemade pasta and a lot of flavor. The portion was large as well. The veal Marsala was rich and delicious!

The garden seating area looks the same, the main dining room is still lovely and service is still attentive but the food - waaaay below past years quality. I usually travel alone for business but this trip my wife joined me and I chose Il Cortile for dinner one night. It's still quite romantic in setting but frozen gnocchi? Stale bread? C'mon you're better than that!With all the options for great Italian in Manhattan the proprietors here have let it decline to a great setting but terrible food.

4.0,7/5/2016,"I was in Little Italy on my way to a different restaurant when I stopped to look at the menu at Il Cortile.  The maitre d outside began telling me of the specials which included Lobster Ravioli, one of my favorites, so I decided to try someplace new. I asked to be seated inside (they do have nice street side seating as well). The host found me a great window table. Right away, the service was very attentive and that would be a theme throughout my evening.At first I was a bit nervous. They brought me bread which rather than the nice fresh baked bread with oil and balsamic that I'm used to in nicer NY Italian restaurants, their bread basket consisted of sesame seed bread sticks, super-market style pre-sliced Italian bread, and two slices of focaccia (which didn't seem fresh either) along with a couple pats of butter.  That was a bit disappointing.However when my main dish came, the Lobster Ravioli, all disappointment disappeared.  What a great dish.  The meal came presented quite nicely with a mint leaf and two lobster legs adorning 5 generously stuffed ravioli. Diced tomatoes and sliced onion were dashed about as well with a light creamy sauce that was absolutely terrific.  The Ravioli themselves were cooked to perfection. The flavors in the dish all complimented each other nicely with the lobster being bold yet still not overbearing.Since my tradition is to get a canoli anytime I'm in New York, that seemed like a perfect selection for dessert.  Boy was I glad.  Out came a plate with two smaller canoli.  The shells were absolutely terrific, crispy and flaky. The filling was the perfect blend of sweetness and cheeses with a light addition of mini-chocolate chips. Simply wonderful.Throughout the evening, I received some of the most attentive service I've ever experienced. I'm not even sure who was officially my server as I had everyone from the general manager, to the maitre d to the bus boy checking on me at every opportunity.

However, this spot will always hold a place in my heart as it was my first date with my girlfriend before she became my girlfriend.The bread basket is good in which they provide a variety of breads and bread sticks. For entrees, my girlfriend ordered the penne vodka, while I ordered the Capellini Piselli e Prosciutto Speciali (capellini with meat sauce, tomatoes, prosciutto, mushroom, peas and cream). My pasta was undercooked, so I asked informed the waiter. He replied with an arrogant and rude tone that that was how it's suppose to be, but took the dish back to be cooked more anyways. I was certainly worried that he could have spit in my food afterwards.

As for the food, it's characteristic, delicious Italian, and I can't think of one single complaint about anything.  I like Italian food very much, and it seemed you couldn't go wrong with just about anything on the menu.  My parents felt the same.Thousands of people eat along this street every year, and it obviously generates thousands of different opinions.  Some people are overly-picky, but I firmly believe you could put a blindfold on, spin around with your finger pointed out, and wherever you ended up, you'd still be getting a much better Italian experience than what's to be found at the typical Maggiano's or Olive Garden...or at Disney.",1,1,2,Jim H.,"Philadelphia, PA",1,122,0

Upon insistence, we were seated in the backroom which has a glass roof and brick walls beautifully decorated with string lights. However the menu was on cheap crumbly paper. The table for two we were seated at had the chairs adjacent to each other... who the hell arranges a table like that? Anyways, we decided not to say anything and just let it pass. And then it started to get really bad. We were given appetizers and the the bread was cold and hard. Like inedible hard. Paired with cold bland pasta sauce. I think Ragu makes better sauce than what they placed at our table. Then we got the baby calamari we ordered- it was terrible. I believe it was undercooked, it had a very strange rubbery consistency, and the breading was just crumbling off everywhere. There was also this potato dish - bland and terrible. I couldn't believe how bland it was.After waiting forever for our main dishes, my pasta was HARD. The pasta was quite undercooked, and the sauce was again bland. I was really disappointed. My boyfriend ordered some seafood dish with tiger shrimp. The shrimp looked disgusting, but hey, say nothing till you try it right? Yeah, it was pretty bad. His linguine was also undercooked and hard. I felt bad, because these dishes were $20 and $27 respectively - we should have expected it to taste good, even if it didn't look good. And then the waiters. They were alright. One was really kind and but inattentive. There were only three other tables to be manned. So we couldn't even say that it was busy and they had a lot of people to wait on. The other waiter with the ponytail spilled water all over the table and did a half assed job drying it. Now we had a wet table top. It was just one mishap after another. By the end of the evening, I was trying not to say anything because I knew my boyfriend really wanted to surprise me and it would just solidify that he had picked the worst place in the world. While I went to the bathroom, he got the check. And they had the nerve to include the tip there. Those waiters did not deserve the gratuity they slapped on our check.

Sal said he could create a Chef Sampler for 6 because the 8 would be too much food and he would separate the seafood appetizers for the people with food allergies. First I was impressed he didn't try to rip us off because he could have just taken our order. The appetizers were mixture of hot and cold items. All of them were amazing and just like Sal said, the portions were just right for our group. I have never been to Il Cortile before and picked the restaurant solely on the picture of their lovely garden room and the menu. The reviews for Yelp were mixed but since they have been in business for 40 years, that's gotta be a good thing.We ordered penne Bologanese, veal Sambuca, lobster ravioli, steak paillard, etc. Throughout the whole party, everyone kept saying what a great place the restaurant was, the appetizers, entrees and service was wonderful. We brought a cake to the party and the waiters served it with espresso and cappuccinos (awesome). They charged a slicing fee of $2.50 per person, which I thought was super reasonable. (I have been to restaurants that charge $5 just for slicing the cake. This is a rip off and a crime in my book.)My group and I enjoyed the wonderful and warm hospitality.

Now for the menu, if there was an award for most tourist and family friendly restaurant without being overrun with tourists this would be it. They have the basics of Northern Italian fare, an a la carte, price fix, and pasta anyway that you like it, you can always ask a veteran waiter what is their favorite and you will get an honest opinion.

2.0,8/22/2014,"We have been longtime fans of Il Cortile, remembering it as a classic higher-end Italian restaurant where food was delicious, portions were large and the energy level was high.  A place where locals, businesspeople and tourists alike came to enjoy the food and environment, and the restaurant was bustling with activity. Unfortunately, I saw none of that when we took some out of town friends for dinner the other night.  Little Italy has shrunk over the years and restaurant row on Mulberry Street is mostly tourists wandering past hawkers offering free drinks with dinner.  Il Cortile seems to be a victim of this trend, complete with its own hawker.  Maybe because it was a weeknight, but the restaurant was almost empty at 7 pm other than the garden atrium (which we requested and is the preferable indoor seating area) and the few tables on the outside patio.  The large restaurant's two large dining rooms scarcely had diners.The food itself was okay but nowhere as good as I remember.  We started with a bread basket of sliced French bread and bread sticks, which came with pats of butter wrapped in foil, no olive oil.  They were nothing special and felt like a cheap way to start off.  For appetizer we had tri color salad, again okay but not remarkable.  For our main courses we had veal parmigiana, chicken parmigiana and chicken francese.  These were good and the portions were large but frankly they were no better than probably half the other restaurants on the block.  Also, these dishes don't come with pasta but you can get a side order for $7.50.  The restaurant is good for families given the large seating areas, but they had no kid's menu.  Our friend's kid wanted garlic bread and also meat balls with his spaghetti and we were told they didn't make these.  I understand these are not typical dishes in nicer Italian restaurants but business might be better if they make their menu more kid and family-friendly.Overall, the restaurant feels like it's seen better days.  It suffers from being too big at a time when Little Italy and its diner population are shrinking--and changing to more tourists and families.  We'll try somewhere else on our next visit to Little Italy.",5,0,2,Dave L.,"New York, NY",32,361,10
3.0,8/17/2014,"Personally I don't understand all the rave reviews. I thought this place was a basic Italian restaurant. While the food was good nothing stood out as overly amazing or memorable. Negatives:- A wine by the glass menu does not exist. You select from a verbal listing. So beyond ""Chardonnay"" you don't know if you are getting a Italian or Californian wine or what the year is. Not how I prefer to select a wine.- Butter wrapped in foil paper at a nicer restaurant is weird to me- I thought the hot calamari appetizer ranked as some of the least exciting calamari that I have ever had- The bathroom was clean but a bit run down Positives:- The appetizer sampler was ginormous - The pastas were good - The cold calamari was good; possibly the most memorable part of the meal",2,0,0,Kristin B.,"Las Vegas, NV",14,31,22

1.0,7/22/2014,"THIS PLACE IS A JOKE -  I ordered a $100 bottle of Brunello from this authentic italian restaurant in Little Italy and it tasted sour.  Clearly the wine went bad.  I told the waiter (who appeared to be Mexican) and he had no idea what I was talking about.  He got the manager (who was likely Jewish). He was also confused so he got what appeared to be another waiter or a line cook.  He was not a sommelier.  He told me he was from Montalcino (He was likely Albanian).  Even if he was from Montalcino, being from where Brunellos come from does not make you a sommelier.  Is everyone from Napa experts on Cabernets?  I grew up down the street from Merck and close to Giant's stadium. Does that make me a professional football player or an expert on pharmaceuticals?  So he drank some of our wine and decided to decant the wine. I hate when restaurants don't just take the wine back.  Instead they bring out someone (in this case an Albanian line cook) to taste the wine and tell me that I am wrong.  Anyway an hour later the same line cook/pretend sommelier happened to be walking by and asked in passing how the wine was. I said ""it is still terrible"" and he said ""sorry.""  They did not take it off the bill or do anything else. They could not have cared less.  I paid $100 for wine that tasted like poisoned orange juice. This is probably the most expensive Italian restaurant on mulberry and it is grossly unprofessional and treats its customers like stupid tourists.  I also asked the waiter if they could make Chicken Pizzaiola instead of Veal.  My waiter left, came back 15 seconds later and said NO. He didn't ask the chef.  I will never go back.  Go to La Mela instead or avoid little Italy all together.",7,5,1,Thomas C.,"Hoboken, NJ",220,13,3

1.0,7/13/2014,"Our dining experience was a  huge disappointment. Huge disappointment. First we waited about 1/2 hour for a waiter to come by. That was with asking the busboys to get the waiter (about 4 times). Finally the waiter came by (very nice guy) and realized we were never given a wine menu. After he brought the menu he was in a hurry for us to order a bottle of wine and kept recommending some $50 bottle of red that we knew nothing about. Finally we just said fine and stopped reading the wine list.One person in our group ordered 2 appetizers as an entree. One of them came out with her salad. She sent it back until the right time. Eventually when we were done with our salads, they brought the same dish back out - eggplant rollatini - mushed down and browned on top from being re-heated (poorly). My husband's dinner came out with that - scallops - which he loved. My dinner came out about 25 minutes later when they were done. It was pasta with pesto. I asked for shrimp with it - 5 or 6 overcooked, tough shrimp which I did not eat and no one asked about ($31 for the pleasure). The 4th person in our party ate about 30 minutes after I got my dinner. He was less than enthusiastic about his pasta (rigatoni) but who knows if it was so late by then. Finally I asked for the manager. He pretended to be concerned. They sent some desserts over free.

I had the pork chops, which were cooked very well and a very generous portion. We had the fried calamari for appetizer, and it was also good. We also had the fried shrimp, which was not very good. The shrimp were very dry and tough. Overall, the food for the party was good and the portions were very generous. Nothing was above and beyond, yet nothing was bad.Cons:SERVICE! The service here is in need of major improvements. Our server seemed to be dealing with a cold, as he was sneezing and coughing the entire time while taking our order. He was also rude when members of my party would ask for a drink out of his ""order."" Servers who would pour the wine did not have a towel to wipe off the bottle after the pour, so the wine bottle would spill droplets of wine as the server moved onto the next person. Servers bringing the food seemed overly eager to drop the plates on the table without much regard for the people sitting in front of them. On several occasions, I had two servers squeezing me into the middle of my chair. I did not receive an ""excuse me"" or ""sorry"" throughout the entire dinner.Overall, the food here is good but nothing special, and the service needs great improvement. I would not dine here again, nor would I recommend this establishment.

1.0,4/15/2014,"One of my favorite things about walking around Manhattan is discovering new places (and truly, Manhattan is a place for wonderful food).  Generally, I find the service to be very good, as well.Yesterday, my gf and I were walking around and ended up in Little Italy.  As we walked by this restaurant, a Maitre D, or manager, not sure what his position is...asked if we'd like to sit and he offered us a table on the patio.  He was well dressed in a suit and seemed like a likable guy.I went to the restroom and when I got back, I asked my gf if the waiter had come by.  She said that someone came by and said he would bring water to the table.  Just then, he comes back to put down bread and water.  We decided it was a nice day and we'd like to have a glass of wine and some desserts.  We asked the guy with the bread (don't think he was the server exactly) if we could get a wine menu.  That's when he said ""I don't think that's allowed...I'll have to ask and see.""He went over to the guy in the suit and next thing I know, the guy in the suit tells someone else ""we can make a table for 5"" and he tells us to get up and leave!  We hadn't even ordered yet.  The other customer looked at our table, saw the water and bread and had an uncomfortable look on his face as they pulled out table next to another one to make seating for 5.  As I got up, the guy that brought the bread said something about an upstairs, but the guy in suit just looked at me like I was trash, so we left.  Maybe it was because I was wearing shorts and a baseball cap (but the other diners weren't dressed much better), but as I walked off the guy in the suit said ""This is a 5-star restuarant."" And the funny thing is that printed on their menu is the phrase ""the customer is always right.""  I guess not.  And, they weren't even busy....the inside was totally empty.Well, they may be 5-stars in his mind, but their service level is 0 stars.  I only give it 1 here because that's the lowest rating.  I guess he thought the other diners (whom he used our table for) looked like they had more money and that he didn't think I had money to spend...not sure...but we dropped $336 the night before at The Robert at Columbus Circle - a true 5-star establishment worth every penny.  And, guess what...next time I drop that kind of money on dinner or lunch or any food...it WILL NOT be at Il Cortile.  They will never get even $1 of my money and I'll encourage all of my friends and their friends (and you, dear reader) to stay away unless you, too, want to be treated as trash.   If you check all of my other reviews (over 200 posted reviews), I think you'll see I'm fair (and actually, I tend to give lots of praise to NYC establishments and rate them very high).  Not this place.   I hope the guy in the suit really likes the ""5-star"" food beause, I'm sure he'll be only one left eating it someday soon.  There is no toleration for treating people this way.After we left, my gf was very offended.  I really didn't care...I'll just never go back...but she dwelled on it.  My advice is to go somewhere that will actually treat you with a little respect and be glad to have your business.",7,2,0,Bryan B.,"Atlanta, GA",8,215,1
1.0,4/9/2014,"This place blows. Period. I don't know what is wrong with me. I just don't like Italian food. I guess I have a weird palate. It has been confirmed by my family. Haha. There was a work function here, so after a long day of work, I trek over here. It is in the heart of Little Italy, so definitely convenient, but that's the only plus side. They do give baskets of bread, which was edible and if you're starving will tie you over. For appetizers, we had the fried calamari and baked clams. Nothing exciting or special. All greasy and nothing exciting. I could get this stuff at a carry-out Italian place and for way cheaper. For the pasta dish, they screwed up my order. They gave me fettucini with pesto. I did not want that. I wanted a red sauce, but I was deprived of that. I said specifically no cheese, but was totally ignored. I would be careful when you come here if you have food allergies. Luckily I did not start convulsing. For the main dish I had the monkfish with artichokes. I have never had a more terrible dish of monkfish. I mean how can you screw up monkish? The fish just tasted rubbery and over cooked. Maybe the fish was frozen. That was probably it. The artichokes were not edible. I mean I have healthy teeth (no dentures yet) and I could barely chew the artichoke. What in the world was that?I am usually not that big of a critic. Usually when I go out to eat, I don't complain that much, but seriously the monkfish was awful. So when the waiter came back to take my dish, he asked me if I wanted it to-go. I shook my head and told him, ""it was terrible."" He was speechless. I guess there's not much you can say to that. Oh well, at least I tried this place. And experienced it.

The food was delicious and in a great portion size. Everything else was severely lacking. The manager/owner (I don't know what he really was) was extremely annoying and we were treated as if our company was not welcome. We were seated in a crammed little transition space between the main dining room and the garden room even though there were tons of open tables available. When asked about what we wanted to drink we requested a drink menu and were told they didn't have one but not to worry because they had everything behind the bar. Once we finally guessed what drinks we wanted, two couples seated next to us were given a drink menu. The bread that came out was cold and we were not given any olive oil to dip into, and again the other couples were. Our meals arrived pretty quickly but not once during our entire meal were we asked if we needed anything or if the food was alright. There were visible disputes between the host and the manager throughout our evening. The staff seemed to play favorites amongst guests and showed attention only to those who seemed to be paying the most for the meals. Our table was tiny and there was a plant in my face all night situated on a window sill. An empty beer bottle sat on the already crowded miniature table for the entire night and was not removed until after the bill was already paid.

Food: everything was merely okay, and did not elicit any ""wow"" from any of the six people in our party. Pesto sauce pasta sure looked like Jia Jiang Mian but actually tasted quite good. Lobster pasta was obviously made with frozen lobster and wasn't great, especially since fresh lobster can be found at many of the Chinese establishments for a fraction of the price. Service: not that responsive, there was wait staff just standing around.Decor: this is what earned it an extra star. This place looks extremely clean and the interior has a unique design.

Disappointing, especially given the fact I called 5 months earlier to make a reservation. There were no meals that were basic, such as lasagna, stuffed shells, manicotti...and what they had were more expensive than I thought they should have been. Unfortunately we were not in the garden room and where we were we had very loud noise bouncing off the floor and metal ceiling. So book the garden room or the area right by the main entrance. Once you are in the room away from the main entrance it is just loud! I appreciated the gluten -free penne and spaghetti being available. I did like their tomato sauce.

I even brought my mom in from out of town since she'd never been and we walked from our hotel nearly 2 miles to get to this place. We ended up leaving with nausea and a damaged wallet after being completely ripped off, insulted and lied to! Our server was completely deceiving. I've been to this restaurant for lunch before (2 months ago and 2 years ago), and both times had received a lunch menu (always went around 12 or 1 p.m.) along with a dinner menu. When we sat down around 12:30 we were handed a regular menu. Our waiter returned 5 or so minutes later and asked if we were ready to order. After reading the dinner menu and seeing the overpriced dishes (average was 20), I asked him if there was a lunch menu since that's what I remember ordering from. I even remembered the exact dish's name! He said NO. I then asked if the menu was new. He said no. So we reluctantly proceeded to order our meal. I ordered the capellini with vodka sauce and decided to try the chicken (the previous times I had ordered the same pasta dish but with shrimp). When I received my food I was disgusted with the chicken. It was absolutely inedible. Probably the worst chicken I have ever eaten. I asked my mother to try it and she was equally disgusted. Totally processed and frozen.When I told our server, he did not even apologize.  I expected that the upcharge for the chicken would be removed from our bill and said nothing further. I left the chicken on the plate.When we finished our meal, a random server dropped a dessert at our table and said nothing. We thought maybe it had gone to the wrong table, but then wondered if maybe if was an effort to apologize. It would have been a nice gesture if our server had come with that and an apology. But nothing. We get the bill and it was around $46. For lunch with no alcohol, this is pretty ridiculous. ESPECIALLY when the inedible chicken was still part of the bill. Half of my dish was sent back to the kitchen and never once did anyone apologize. Not wanting to deal with it, I paid the bill and we left. On our way out we noticed a couple who had a lunch menu (a replica of the one I remember ordering from my previous visits) and additionally found a lunch menu at the front, which showed our dishes at nearly half the price!!! Just like I remembered! I never expected to come to lunch to spend 50 without even a drink. Plenty of businesses on the street featured $10 lunches with probably much better food. We walked away for about 1 minute before realizing this was just unacceptable. We came back in and presented the first person we saw with our situation. We were absolutely sickened by the waiter who approached to defend himself and acted like we lied! He said I never asked for a lunch menu - that I only asked if the menu was new. I said no, I've been here before and this menu was not the lunch menu. He continued to say I never asked for the lunch menu. SINCE WHEN DOES SOMEONE GOING TO LUNCH NEED TO ASK FOR A LUNCH MENU??? He was so arrogant, rude and made me regret the tip I left him!!! The place offered us no refund or adjustment, and simply said to come back and they'd take care of us.

But when we opened the menu, the cheapest pasta , spaghetti puttanesca  was $18.... I had linguini with simple pesto.. And that was $18. Including my brothers dish we ended up paying 70 dollars total including the tip. It was totally unbelievable. I tried to be optimistic while eating my food, but in the end it was just a huge disappointment. There was nothing special about what we had and the it was way too over priced for what we ate. 18 dollars for a regular pesto dish is just inconceivable.

It's the kind of place that is a little over decorated, a little dated and has service that is a tad ostentatious--which is pretty much what I expect of a place on Mulberry in Little Italy. The wall by our table had a plaque announcing that James Gandolfini had eaten there, and I suspect that a certain sort of person upon hearing that might roll their eyes and look elsewhere while another type of person would want to visit because of it. The food is very good, but perhaps not a great value for the price.  No one in my party had a reason to complain or rave.  We ordered pasta and chicken dishes, and everything was fine.You have a lot of choices on Mulberry--just try to walk down the street with being accosted by hosts trying to lure you in--and I haven't dined at enough places to rank Il Cortile against the many other options.  I'm not sure foodies will find what they are looking for in this restaurant's very traditional approach, but I do think visitors to the area may enjoy the Little Italy experience offered by Il Cortile.",0,0,0,Augie R.,"Chicago, IL",167,835,147

Initially the place looked promising - after all, we were on vacation and relaxed. So we did not keep track of the time after we ordered the food - until we realized that it had been more than 45 minutes and still no food. We attempted to seek out our server but he had not been around. So we decided to make an eye contact with someone. We finally was able to speak to a manger-looking person (It had been over an hour by this time.). He checked with the kitchen and told us that there was a glitch with the computerized ticket system.  That really did not excuse the server for not checking on our table to make sure that our food arrived okay. The manager apologized and told us that the food would be ready in 4 minutes (It actually took 7 minutes). We were very upset and ready to walk out. The server later asked how the food was, and we shook our heads. He did not make any attempt or made accomodation to credit our bill in any way. They gave us the rasberry topped custard desert, which three of us shared. Oh, by the way, the bread they brought to the table - sesame stick crackers, dried up Italian sliced bread - none of them look authentic or even flavorful.

5.0,5/14/2012,"On an impromptu decision to go out for dinner during a conference in NYC, our hotel concierge recommended Il Cortile. I had never been to Little Italy before, but being from Rhode Island, I've had plenty of delicious, authentic Italian food on Federal Hill, so my expectations were high.I have to say, when we arrived we were a little disheartened that there were so few people dining here. It was a Tuesday night, but still, it is in our nature to judge an establishment by how many patrons it has. So my expectations went down a bit. I must say, we were more than pleasantly surprised and WOWed by Il Cortile. I see that a lot of people posted negative reviews because of bad service, so maybe it was pure luck that it wasn't busy when we went and the service was impeccable. Our waiter was extremely friendly, generous and attentive. He gave us suggestions and shared with us the long list of specials that all sounded divine. We started out with the antipasto, which had some pickled eggplant or something that I have never had before but was unbelievably delicious. Then for dinner, both myself and my colleague ordered off the specials menu - she had a homemade cheese tortellini with lobster meat in a cream sauce, and I had the lobster ravioli. Oh my word. So delicious. SO filling. We had no plans to have dessert, until some magically appeared on our table... on the house. We got the opportunity to try some delicious raspberries in some sort of cream that I think was made with wine or some sort of liquor (I can't remember what it was called) as well as an almond cake that reminded me a little of tiramisu. Overall, we had a fabulous experience, thanks largely to the great waitstaff, so I hope my review will be helpful to others who may be disheartened by some of the negative ones here!

I figured Little Italy would be a great place to capture it all and order whatever, instead of the million Italian places by my house that all seem to specialize in one thing. The meals were 50-50, luckily his was good but mine was just average. But the service was such a letdown! First, it took forever for the waiter to come over. He was just rude, obviously overly proud of this place to be dealing with us. When my friend asked a cooking question about the meal, he answered very snobbily, as I saw him do with another set of customers next to us. Then when we paid, he ""claimed"" he couldn't swipe my friends card, and gave him two receipts with the entire bill on them that said Paid, valid. He said he canceled it but who knows if he did. They could have charged our whole table twice! (We're obviously going to follow up on this). Which brings me to the final issue - price was crazy! Maybe I'm a cynical NYer, but before you bring me bad service you better bring me orgasmic food. And this just wasn't the case.

His seafood pasta dish was huge and it can be shared. He was kind enough to let me pick off of his lobster tail and claw along with him. Although he loved his plate, he loved mine just a tad better. We should have stopped there, but decided to go the extra mile in celebration and order dessert. We had the riccotta cheesecake, which I knew we shouldn't have ordered, since I don't like riccotta cheese, so I wasn't a fan of it, but my husband loved it. I should have ordered the coffee for dessert, b/c it looked heavenly. We will definitely be visiting this restaurant again during our next trip to NYC and we have strongly suggested our parents go, who will be visiting NYC in December. The fact that our waiter had an Italian accent, spoke Italian and the doorman was your typical funny NY Italian guy, was just a bonus.

3.0,10/11/2011,"Was here for a rehearsal dinner where massive quantities of food was provided family style. I hadn't eaten this much in one sitting in years. There were shared apps - meats, cheeses, peppers, etc. I loved their baked clams and the fried shrimps were good. There was pasta course and salad course and entree course. By the time I got my veal - which was a little on the tough side - I was so full my table had fallen into a complete food coma. I had to run before the dessert course was served, but I suspect it would have been just as rich and gut-busting. The service was hectic, perhaps as to be expected, but one of the waiters was hilarious and I thoroughly enjoyed his advice on why women need three napkins.",0,0,0,Janie W.,"York, ME",44,287,0

5.0,9/18/2011,"This place is so nice. I brought 4 friends that were visiting NY from Ireland, along with my Sicilian boyfriend, and we were all very much impressed with the food. The service was timely, tho our waiter seemed a little on the older side of the average waiter, and prooved that old men, just are grumpier! We got over that, and overall loved the place. We were seated in the back on a hot summer's night, which gave us the feeling of eating outside in  some beautiful mediteranian city, but without having to deal with the NYC heat or foot traffic. It was lovely. We all ordered our dishes, but weren't quite sure what they came with, and honestly were not informed. And tho all the dishes were delicious and plentiful, it would have been nice to know that there was no pasta, veg, or potato included with the dish. This was especially disappointed to my friend that got the steak. Yes, the steak was awesome, but a little bit of flavor change is good. When he ordered the potato,our waiter said, ""NO!, you have enough!!!!!"" we had to insist, that we were sure we wanted potato! All said and done, I will be back...

3.0,9/5/2011,"This place was good. We stopped in for dinner here on our last night of vacation in New York. We walked in around seven and the place was packed, but the host seated us near the front within ten minutes. There was some luke-warm bread on the table, and the bus boys were very quick to fill our water up every time the glasses got low. Unfortunately, our waiter left quite a bit to be desired- he popped in once to get our order, was very short with us and seemed agitated when we weren't sure which type of filet mignon we wanted. We ordered fried mozzarella, and it was delicious- not in sticks like in other restaurants, but in triangular wedges, and you could tell it was fresh. I had rigatoni with vodka sauce and sausage, and my fiance had a filet mignon with some kind of onion-based sauce. My pasta was delicious, but the filet seemed a bit under-cooked (she ordered medium, but it was quite bloody). Also, I expected some type of accompaniment to the steak, but it was really just a hunk of meat on a plate with no real presentation. The most disappointing part of this restaurant was the wine list...or lack there of. If I'm paying upwards of eighty dollars for a meal, I would really like a decent list to choose from- but they only had a house red and a house white. I had the red and it was just ok. We found a Groupon that took ten dollars off of our meal and they accepted it without any problems. Overall, the food was great, but the service (except for the host, who was very accommodating) was lacking. OH ONE MORE THING ABOUT THE SERVICE- throughout the night, I noticed the bartender looking at me, but dismissed it, guessing that we had just accidentally caught glance. But after this happening several times, I was starting to feel uncomfortable, and I ignored his general direction for the rest of the night. When we left, however, I heard a very loud kissing/puckering sound and noticed him giving me exxagerated kissy faces and winks.

2.0,7/11/2011,"Man Friend and I were in Chinatown and we were kinda sick of eating Asian food all the time so I suggested we try something new! Little Italy is right down the block, I yelped whatever was nearby and came up with this place. The glowing reviews made it sound so promising but we had such a bad experience with the staff. We came during a weekday afternoon since both of us had the day off and were greeted by a host. You walk into the restaurant and it's kinda dimly lit and sort of like a cavern. I walked farther in and saw that in the back of the restaurant, there was a sun room type of setting. It was a beautiful day out and while I did want to sit outside, I did not want my food to be exposed to the elements of NYC traffic and tourists clogging up the sidewalk. Idk, I'm weird like that but I'm not exactly keen on the taste of muffler.  After I saw the sun room, I pointed to it and asked the host if we could sit there. The host tried soooo hard to dissuade us from sitting there and to sit in the front of the restaurant... it was strange and really off-putting, y'know?After a few minutes, when we finally sat down in the sun room area, I realized that it was probably of the way my boyfriend was dressed that they were treating us like that. I was dressed pretty casually, so were other diners, but the bf was dressed in an oversized shirt and baggy jeans. It really didn't seem like the type of establishment where a dress code was going to be enforced during the middle of the day when everyone else was dressed casually. Just to give you a visual, he was NOT wearing gang colors, beads, du-rags, or anything spray painted in graffiti letters and lYkE DisZ, gUyZ.The servers just tossed the bread basket onto our table and there was a noodle and a random splash of marinara sauce in it. Really...? My pesto penne was chunky? It was not pureed smoothly and was quite watery!! WTF???When we received the bill, I didn't appreciate the hovering. We're not going to run full speed the 100 feet from the back of the restaurant, leaping over tables, chairs, and your servers to avoid paying the check. In fact, you'd have received a rather nice tip had you treated us better but I guess your tip was lost somewhere in the folds of Man Friend's baggy clothing.If I knew the service was going to depend on the baggy factor of my boyfriend's pants, we'd have gotten up and left a long time ago. I don't appreciate the fact that the staff at Il Cortile judged him for it and it reflected in the service. Il Cortile, you're not his mother, so back off!",6,0,2,Mandy Y.,"Hollis, NY",145,104,22

My family was in the city for the afternoon and my Dad is not big on the city's love of ""brunch,"" so we went down to Little Italy for a hearty meal.Il Cortile is a surprisingly large restaurant, with an outdoor seating patio, indoor restaurant/bar area and then in the far back is an enclosed indoor courtyard where we were seated. Our server was attentive and we were immediately presented with water and a bread basket with 2-3 different types of bread in it. Each menu is used only once (a large folded and sealed piece of paper--I found it a unique touch) and there was a large variety of items to meet everyone's palate. Everyone in our party was pleasantly surprised with their meals and the portions were generous.

I had a great pasta dish - Fettuccine di Parma.  It had homemade noodles and sweet sausage in an exquisite sauce. I would definitely recommend it.  It was the best pasta I've ever eaten.

1.0,5/29/2011,"I've trusted Yelp reviews many times, and this is the first time I've ever been so badly burned at a restaurant recommended by other yelpers.  I signed up for Yelp expressly to write this review because I have never had such an awful experience at any restaurant before.  Here's the low-down:I went to this restaurant last night after a lovely day in Chinatown and Little Italy.  The ambiance was what drew me in; it really looks like a charming place.  We were seated at a cute table outside, as it was a very nice day.  The waiter was attentive at first, but once we ordered, he was very difficult to track down.  But this is not unusual for NY, so I didn't think much of it.  When I got my food, things took a turn for the worse.  I had ordered the ravioli with a half lobster.  The lobster came entirely in the shell, covered in sauce, with no utensils to open it, as though they expected me to pick up this hot, saucy lobster and wrestle it open with my bare hands.  When I finally did snag the waiter, I politely asked if I could have a cracker and a lobster fork.  He came back quite quickly with the cracker, but no fork, and didn't stick around long enough for me to ask for the fork again.  The host, whom we were seated right next to, asked if something was wrong.  I said, ""Oh, thanks, yeah, I just need a lobster fork.""  I thought I was getting nice service.  The host came back with an ordinary fork.  I said ""Oh, no sorry, I need a lobster fork to get the meat out of the shell.""  He said they didn't have any such thing.  I began my next sentence with, ""Well, but then I don't understa..."" The host cuts me off and says, ""Ok, I know something nasty and sarcastic is about to come out of your mouth, and I don't need it.""  I was simply intending to ask if I could get some help with the lobster!  So I start to say ""Oh, no, I was just..."" He cuts me off again, and says ""Lady, don't even try it, my mama's meaner than you could ever hope to be.  I'm outta here.""  And he walks inside the restaurant.  I can't get our waiter's attention, until the woman seated behind me gets her lobster (the exact same thing I ordered) and she stops the waiter to say that she can't eat it without utensils!  I chimed in to the waiter and said I was having the same problem.  The host overhears this and says, ""Can't you give it a rest, princess?""  Well, jeez!  We can't eat our food!  I start getting a bit emotional and teary at this point, which I admit was probably an over-reaction, but this guy was just so rude!  He assumed for no reason that I was some kind of monstrous woman when all I needed was some utensils!  The manager comes over to our table, and I told him what happened.  I said I'd either like some utensils or to order something else.  He says he'll take care of it.  No one came back to our table the rest of the night except to bring the check.  The waiter saw us trying to flag him down but ignored us.  I said to my friend, wow I can't believe they didn't give me a new menu.  The host overhears me again and leans over to say, ""You eat this, or nothing at all, make a choice.""  The waiter did finally come back to drop off the check, which he slammed on the table as he blew past.  We were charged for the lobster, despite the fact that I literally didn't take a single bite (not even of the ravioli, as I was quite upset at this point and had lost my appetite).  We decided we were going to get nowhere with these people, paid the bill (no tip), and left.I just can't tell you how unpleasant an experience this was, and after I was in such a good mood from a lovely day in the neighborhood!  The host just killed the whole experience for me.  The ambiance was nice, the waiter was standard for NY (so not a very good server), and I'm sure the food was fine, though very overpriced for rather standard Italian fare.  But I don't want to have my character impuned by the host just because I ask for a fork!",0,1,0,Katharine M.,"Simi Valley, CA",0,3,0

4.0,12/18/2010,"I'm always amazed by how much space the restaurants in Little Italy occupy. I could easily envision one storefront divided up into three miniatures resulting in crammed tables, elbows knocking and eavesdropping.Il Cortile, or The Courtyard, is spacious and decorated in a manner befitting the neighborhood. If you visit during the holiday season, be sure to keep an eye out for the lit reindeer feeding on a plate of vegetables. And that's just on the outside! Inside you'll find a large statue of what appears to be a  goddess or glorified woman. Tables for four are abundant  as are round tables for larger groups. We were squeezed in without a reservation.The menu arrives as if it were a personal missive sent from a di Medici -- sealed for your eyes only. Prying open the seal reveals a thorough selection of pastas, antipastas (Does the meeting of pasta and antipasta result in a huge explosion like when matter and antimatter collide?) seafood, steak, chicken and more.Before we had time to decide, an impressive bread basket was placed on our table, filled with an abbondanza of grains. I especially liked the pre-sliced focaccia, something I don't see in typical bread baskets. We started with the baked clams and were given a plate of about 8 rather small shells. The seasoning and such was just right but I was a little disappointed by the tiny clams. However, the garlic rich broth they were served in was delicious compensation for dipping bread in.Up next, my pasta plate of fettucini di Parma or homemade noodles with sweet sausage, wild mushrooms, parmigiano, garlic, shallots and olive oil. From the generously sliced garlic to the crumbled sweet sausage, this was pure pasta heaven. Once again my hand was drawn to bread to sauce to mouth in an almost involuntary trance of deliciousness.Absolutely nothing remained on the plate after I sopped up every inch of sauce. Few dishes strike a familiar chord of something that my mother or grandmother would have made-- this is one such dish.Service was smooth and unobtrusive. Water refills happened seamlessly and many grazies were given throughout the night. I was slightly disappointed by the dessert selections but through no fault of the restaurant. During my walk to the restaurant I observed many a cannoli and pastry offering that turned my appetite in such a direction. While Il Cortile offered choices of cheesecake,tiramisu, sorbetto and zabaglione, I was craving a different sort of pastry so we skipped dessert.When all was said and done, the total for one appetizer and two entrees came to $57.I'd definitely return for another plate of pasta and more mangia-ing.",6,6,5,Tom K.,"Forest Hills, NY",337,820,47

They see you and think, ""Cha-ching, suckas!""The remaining Italian red sauce joints on Mulberry are pretty much all the same. If people don't know, the classic Little Italy scam is the family-style serving. The menu says antipasti are $18. Ok fine, so the waiter says. ""eh, we gonna getta da 4 plates"" Translates to $18x4=$72. Cha-ching! They come out with one plate with sopressatta, prosciutto, mozzarella, roasted red peppers, olives, stuff that you can get at ANY  Italian deli"" for about $20. My jaw dropped. Everyone loved it. Cheapest bottles of wine are $40 red or white. We got 2 whites and 4 red. Cha-ching! $240.Dishes are between $18-35 for typical Italian fare you'd find anywhere in NY. Fra diavolos, chicken francese, picatta, etc. all the usual fare but portions are not very big. Good but nothing special.Add 3 desserts at $9/each, after-dinner drinks and the bill came to $1000 bucks. The folks who invited us paid for the whole meal which was insane so I'm not complaining but I felt bad that they picked this spot to be ripped off.Tourists, if you want authentic home cooked Italian food and ambiance at a fraction of the cost and mega portions, take the subway to Bay Ridge or Bensonhurst in Brooklyn.

2.0,9/24/2010,"My boyfriend had the grand idea of going down to Little Italy for the San Gennaro festival for dinner. I have an aversion to touristy and overcrowded places, but sucked it up to make him happy. Went on Yelp to find a decently priced place with good food, and Il Cortile came up as a good option.  We got seated pretty quickly which was great given how crowded the neighborhood was because of the festival. But I must say that while the food was pretty good, I felt it was overpriced. $15 for fried calamari (and a relatively small portion at that) is really a bit much I think.  The restaurant only had the ""San Gennaro festival menu"" available, not a regular menu, and I'm wondering if they jacked up the prices because of all the tourists who would be coming through. I ordered a gnocchi dish (stuffed with chicken, spinach and ricotta), which was actually really good. The gnocchi were delicate and not overcooked, and the sauce was nice flavor- a creamy tomato based sauce. So why only two stars?  My boyfriend wanted pasta, and the weird thing was that the menu was written to force one to pay for two entrees if one wanted a pasta dish with meat. So my boyfriend wanted to have penne with shrimp, and it would've cost him $15 for penne, and then an additional $19 for shrimp! So basically all the pasta dishes were priced separately from the meat/seafood dishes. I saw a lady sitting across from us with two plates in front of her (one pasta, and one meat)... I think that's just highway robbery.  So my boyfriend ended up getting fettucine with pesto sauce (no meat or anything else) and it cost roughly $17.  The kicker: The bill included a 20% gratuity-- the menu did NOT say anything about gratuity included automatically.  And the service SUCKED. We had to wait for water, the food took forever to come out, etc etc.  Anyway, I guess they maybe try to slip that in to take advantage of tourists...  We just asked for the manager and made him bump it down to 15%.  Verdict: Some dishes good; but overpriced with generally bad service",2,0,0,Nyasha G.,"New York, NY",1,25,2
3.0,9/24/2010,"I went to Il Cortile with some family and friends during the San Gennaro festival based on a recommendation.  There was street seating available so I can't say much about the ambience inside besides the fact that it's big.  They have multiple store fronts so I can't imagine getting a reservation would ever be that difficult.  As far as the food goes, Il Cortile was good.  Not one of the best Italian restaurants I've been to but above average.  We ordered two appetizers, (Cold & Hot Antipasto) which were good but overpriced for the amount of food you get.  $16 each for small serving was disappointing.  Serving size for the main dishes was much better.  All the pasta dishes (served al dente) are plentiful and the pork chop entree came with two chops.  Service was good and our wine glasses were never left empty.My only complaint about this place is value.  When ordering house wine, I never ask the price because it is never more than $25 or $30 a bottle.  In Italy you get a cask of house wine for $12 on average.  Now I know this isn't Italy, but asking $40 for a house wine is ridiculous.  This left a bad taste in my mouth after paying $32 for two skimpy appetizers.  With the number of great Italian restaurants in NYC, I probably won't be going back anytime soon.",0,0,0,John D.,"San Francisco, CA",127,218,34

We decided we would check out Little Italy on our last day since neither of us had ever been there before. The concierge at our hotel recommended Il Cortile so we decided to try it for lunch. When we walked in the door, the atmosphere was very warm and inviting, especially since it was snowing outside. We sat near the garden room which had all kinds of plants and trees that made you feel like you were somewhere almost tropical, but they also had an assortment of sculptures throughout the restaurant which gave it an Italian flare. It was a very quiet Sunday at lunchtime (as I'm sure many people weren't out taking a stroll in Little Italy in the middle of winter like we were) When we sat down at the table, we were served a delicious basket of assorted breads. For lunch, I had the Capellini with Shrimp in a Creamy Vodka Sauce which was on the lunch menu. It was about $12. It seemed to be a little overcooked. The shrimp were borderline rubbery and the vodka sauce was a little thicker and stickier than I thought it would be. I can't remember what my boyfriend, but I do recall him asking for a beer and the only option they offered was Amstel, which I thought was a little odd.

4.0,8/17/2010,"I never eat in Little Italy because as a person who actually lives in NYC, I think it's tourist-trap-BS. However, I had a friend in town from Portland who was dying to get some good, 'ol fashioned Minestrone soup. I had no idea where to take her, as I am definitely not an expert on Italian. So we checked out our options on Yelp and decided to try Il Cortile. I have to say, I was skeptical at first, as Little Italy kind of freaks me out... Ever notice how everyone there is so aggressive? Restaurants practically try to pull you off the street to eat in their joint... I know we are in a recession people, but really have a little tact! But back to Il Cortile... As we approach the restaurant this cute little older man with a large personality greets us... He points out the lunch specials, which were actually a pretty good deal (There were about 10-12 very popular choices for between $10-$15... Ps... Those are really good prices for Little Italy as most places there are kind of over priced.) Of course, he then proceeds to tell us how the Soprano's had their Christmas party (or something like that) there every year during the years the show was being filmed. He tells us that we have to come see the pictures, so we follow him down these steps... At this point I am looking at my friend like, ""OMG, Where the hell is he leading us to? We are about to get whacked,"" but instead he shows us a picture of Pauly and some other of the Soprano guys next to a Christmas tree made out of Cannoli that apparently cost $40,000. As you can see, we did not get whacked, as I am alive and well here to tell you this tale. By the end of the experience, I felt that Il Cortile felt very Italian, very New York, very homey. I felt like I was in someone's house... If you go, definitely ask to sit in the garden room. It feels like you are outside, but you aren't... So on a day where the weather isn't so great, you get the best of both worlds. My friend got the Minestrone (surprise, surprise) and said that it was really good. I'm vegan so I got some kind of pasta with a lot of vegetables and they were very accommodating. My only semi-complaint is that the service was a little slow... But I think this may be a cultural thing. After all, Italians take a lot of pride in their food, so they don't expect you to rush as you eat it...

Me being Italian, I know for a fact that it's not called ""ragu"" sauce. It's called Sunday Gravy you idiot!!!. Ragu comes out of a jar!Service was very slow (there was only 3 couples in the dining area) and after waiting 20 minutes for someone to take our order, here comes Frankie ""Fingers"" to take our order.Looking at this menu that resembled a slab of the Ten Commandments, we decided to start with a cold antipasto moderately priced at $16.00. Our waiter suggested that we get the antipasto for 2, at which I said ok. We ordered our main courses, as our fresh hot focaccia bread came to the table. Our drinks came, our antipasto came shortly after and to my surprise was very very short of food on it's plate. 2 slices of prosciutto, 2 slices of sopresatta, 1 green olive, 3 gaeta olives, 2 pieces of cured cheese, 2 pieces of tomato with mozzarella, a few peppers and some eggplant out of a jar. We ate it all as we waited patiently for our main course to arrive. Finally 30 min, after our appetizer was finished (which only took 6 minutes to eat), our main course arrived. Our main course was ok, nothing great to rave about and the side dish of pasta I ordered did taste like it had the ""ragu"" sauce out of a jar. It was horrible and cold.

3.0,12/31/2009,"I used to go to this place fairly often around 4-5 years ago and before. The first thing that struck me was when we sat at our tables they had used menus on them. The menus are meant to be used only once, each having a gold seal on them that you break and then presumably thrown away. It was just one of those little things... The career waiters, the majority of whom were from italy, offered firm recommendations and really knew the menu and wines, seemed to have been replaced with waiters who seemed to care very little about really helping you decide what you will like and had very little knowledge of food, wines, etc... The food is still good, for the most part. There were a few things that people ordered at our table that struck me as poorly done (one that jumps to mind is a pasta dish with an orge of shellfish that looked about as bad as it tasted. Other dishes were still fairly well done. For the most part, I won't be going back since the food appears to have dipped below the level you would expect when paying upwards of $30-$40 for a main dish/secondi.

He said they were dried out, but hey buddy, don't order pork chops at an Italian restaurant right ? We were also given a very generous bread baskett. The three stars come from my three complaints: 1. Don't advertise a lunch menu (at considerably cheaper prices) on your website and then not make it available during LUNCH. 2. I don't think a 20% automatic tip is warranted unless it is a large party (at least 6 people or more) or it is advertised on your menu. We were two people and although I always leave a 20% tip for good service, I don't think it should be placed on the bill automatically. Not to mention once I gave my card to pay the bill plus 20% tip, my receipt was returned to me with a spot for additional gratuity. I said the service was good, as in that's what you are supposed to be doing. It was no where near exceptional where a larger tip was warranted. 3. The menus are SOOOO not eco friendly.

Once inside, you can tell that Il Cortile is a traditional, Italian family-styled restaurant, equip with Italian statues and paintings of Italy. We decided to order a green salad and then chicken with pasta, veil pietiola, and monk fish for our main dishes. The green salad was good, but its dressing had a little bite to it. Between the salad and the main course, there was a little bit of a wait but it was made up for because of the helpful and nice service. The chicken with bow tie pasta, asparagus, and tomatoes had a creamy and fresh sauce but it was not heavy. Do not underestimate this dish- they gave me a pretty good sized portion. The veil was rich but not overpowering and was made with fresh roasted peppers instead of canned. The monk fish in broth with artichokes was very good. The fish was light, but it was not flakey like some other fish tend to get. We felt that each dish had distinct flavors and all were made with fresh ingredients.

Both entries were frickin amazing. The sauce in the gnocchi dish was, omg, to die for; so creamy and UGHHHH just amazing. We had tiramisu for dessert, which was delectable; we had expected a PIECE of tiramisu cake but this was served in a wine glass so it was a small portion that turned out to be just right. 1 appetizer, 3 amazing dishes and dessert = less than $90.

2.0,2/1/2009,"Over the past couple of years, I have been here a couple of times with both family and friends, respectively, but my most recent visit (and my least pleasant one) to this establishment will be the basis for my review.Ambiance: Richly decorated with an exposed-brick interior, Roman statutes and ornate furnishings, the restaurant's interior is definitely soothing and inviting. The tables are also appropriately spaced out from each other and the chairs are quite comfortable. It also doesn't usually get too crowded in there or overly loud, so table conversations are not interrupted by cacophony of other patrons' voices.Waiter service: During my most recent visit here last year, our waiter was one of the worst waiters that has tended to my table in a very long time. The waiter was unpleasant, untimely, and unengaged. After he brought our respective dishes, he never once came back to the table to ask how we enjoyed our meal. Then, when he clearly noticed that we were done with our food, he decided to continue to mindlessly chat with his colleagues off to the side instead of clearing our plates and asking us if we wanted the check.  Simply put, such conduct by a waiter is unacceptable and begs for a poor tip.  If this waiter is indicative of how most of the waiters conduct themselves at Il Cortile, than that's a disgrace.Food: It's a shame that our waiter demonstrated such ineptitude because the food here is actually quite good.  While I don't recall what we ordered on that specific evening, the appetizers and entrees I have ordered in the past were all quite good. However, the food isn't good enough to overcome the poor waiter service.  Overall, there are a number of better, lesser-known Italian restaurants in our great city that should be frequented instead of this establishment (Arqua and Dean's come to mind).",3,0,1,Justin P.,"Richmond, VA",171,136,6

4.0,1/4/2007,"I have been to this restaurants 3 times and I think its definitely one of the better places to eat in Little Italy.  The food is good and the service can be a little shady.  It was really nice because I went here in middle of November and my family and I were still able to sit outside, it was unbelievable.Then last month I went here and sat in the back room with my friend and I thought that was a really nice area to sit.For an appetizer I've had the caprese salad and mini calzones (which are really good), there is a chicken stuffed with prosciutto and cheese in a marsala sauce that is to DIE for as an entree... I've had the pastas and they are nothing to write home about.  But I will definitely be going back for this chicken dish.",2,0,1,Charlotte S.,"Tappan, NY",35,255,0
3.0,12/29/2006,"I don't know if its because I live in the neighborhood or because I know what great Italian food should taste like but Il Cortile just didn't have the magic I thought it would.  It is the nicest and priciest restaurant in Lita, so if you are looking for an authentic, guys serenading you, Little Italy experience it will fit the bill.  But I really wasn't completely impressed with the food.  We were a party of 10 and tried every app on the menu and I got to partake in lots of other dishes.  The best antipasti was this grilled octopus and the best entree was this $80 Bistecca alla Fiorentina someone ordered.  It was an amazinggggg steak, but everything else on the table was just ok.",2,0,2,Flora G.,"New York, NY",29,120,40
4.0,12/8/2006,"My husband and I tried Il Cortile on a recent visit to NYC, on the recommendation of YELP!This is the first time I've traveled with Yelp as my guide, and firstly, I just want to say ""Thanks Yelp!""Next, Il Cortile:The atmosphere was great.  Tacky, touristy, good old Little Italy.  The food was very good.  I am not going to say excellent, but definitely very good.  I'd go back again good.  The service was weird.  The waiter pretty much just came, took our order and then left us alone.  Maybe a little bit on the ignored side, but I think maybe he was trying to give us some privacy?  Maybe?  The table behind us was a crowd of Texas ladies who were saying things to him like ""say Badda Bing again!"" and he was hamming it up for them- clearly working the table for his tips.  But he might have just realized that we didn't want him to do that and saved us, and him, the embarrassment.  Or maybe he didn't like me.  There's always that possibility, right?Anyway.  I look forward to trying it again.  I don't think I ordered very well, and next time I think I'll try one of their entrees, cuz as they came out around us they looked pretty incredible.  Still, the caprese salad was excellent, even though it's totally the wrong time of year for it, and the pastas we had were also very, very good.A solid four stars and I look forward to the next time I get to check it outThanks again, NY Yelpers- with fond regards from Cambridge",1,0,2,JJ G.,"Cambridge, MA",742,245,151
5.0,11/8/2006,"Mmm. Very nice, elegant atmosphere, authentic Italian waitstaff, spacious place, back room has a skylight that makes you feel like you're having Sunday brunch with the relatives at an appropriately outdoorsy spot. The menus make you feel like you're receiving a gift --- it's a big piece of paper folded up and sealed with a gold sticker. Bread was varied, but cold. My pasta took 5-10 minutes, but it was soo worth it --- superb. My only complaint is the staff was a bit detached except for a couple of people who took notice of me. One of the guys started talking to me in Italian towards the end of my meal. And I got ""ciao""-ed out of the place.",2,1,1,Catherine H.,"México, D.F., Mexico",87,360,105
5.0,3/23/2006,"What can I say about IL Cortile.I can tell you this. I have been going there on average of 3 times a year since I was 14. I am now 26. Which means atleast 36 times in 12 years. The only changes I have seen made was the expansion of the restaurant to make more room for guests. The food is the best in little italy. For true Italian cuisine and not the same old Chicken Parm/Spaghetti and Meatball dish go to IL Cortile.THe Osso Buco Is out of this world. I cant help but to get the Stuffed Gnocchi whenever I go. Its delicious. I can rattle off the menu and tell you everything that is great but I do not have enough time to type the WHOLE menu. Service is excellent. Franco and crew are great!! If you want an Italian experience then go to the only Italian Restaurant in Little Italy...IL CORTILEIf you notice almost every Restaurant in Lil Italy has a host outside trying to invite you in....NOT HERE, They dont need to drag people off the streets. The name, food, service, and beautiful indoor garden dining room bring you in on its own. If you looking for authentic Italian Fair then this is the place. MUST TRY!!",1,0,0,Chris P.,"New York, NY",0,9,1
5.0,2/8/2006,"Bottle of red, bottle of white...perhaps a bottle of rose tonight...Billy Joel has said that SCENES FROM AN ITALIAN RESTAURANT was inspired by a visit to a joint on Mulberry Street. Il Cortile is right up there with the best Italian restaurants I've experienced.  Great service, OK wine list, desserts are limited but tasty.  The food...SUBLIME.  Bolognese, Sunday ragu, Carbonara..to die for.  Well prepared chicken and veal dishes, from what I've sampled. Possibly my favorite Italian spot in the country.  Forget the fact it's in Little Italy, it's worth the trip.",0,0,0,Joe S.,"Chicago, IL",11,112,1
