3.0,4/23/2019,"Before you sit at Empire Steak House be aware of the 18% gratuity policy, even for 3. Waiter was a little pushy on the wine, wondered if we knew what Burrata was. The steak ordered medium rare arrived in my plate well done ; either they don't know what medium rare is or the cook was take a break and forgot about my patty on the grill. The pushy waiter kind of forgot about us after the food was ordered. Food was ok, nothing spectacular for a $27 burger.",0,0,0,Franck L.,"West Los Angeles, CA",45,22,2

2.0,3/19/2019,"My wife and I arrived in NYC yesterday. We went to the Empire Steak House for lunch at 2 pm. The restaurant had only two other tables occupied; which had already had service. We selected items from the Quick Lunch menu. Simply put, while the service was attentive, that the food took a longer time to prepare and present was hard to figure.  We ordered two different burgers, cooked well done. When the food was served, there were no condiments, except ketchup. We asked for mayonnaise, and waited and waited. What came out was mayonnaise with what appeared to be capers. So we asked for regular mayonnaise, which seemed to make the server confused. We also asked for mustard, salt and pepper. These too took a while to arrive. Finally, when we'd dressed our food, I cut into my burger and it was cooked medium rare.....I couldn't believe it. Called the waiter over, but then a manager seemed to take over the service.  He took my burger and I understood him to say that they would cook another burger.  When the meal returned, it was cooked fully, but as I looked at the meat, it was the same patty, that I'd sliced open, but was pushed back together. By then, I'd pretty much lost my appetite. I ate half of the burger, we finished our drinks, paid, and we left. Bringing me past food, reheated, brings out kitchen concerns that I don't need to expound on.   Not a good first NYC meal, in an upscale restaurant setting, during a low customer volume period, without the basic seasonings for table service, requesting the simplest of restaurant menu items, at upscale restaurant prices.  I guess that I should be glad that our bad experience was with a burger, and not steaks, seafood and chops, which their menu shows for over $100.  Never again!!",0,0,0,T W.,"Oakland, CA",0,13,0

1.0,3/3/2019,"Ordered from here last night.  The oysters and shrimp tasted way off.  The filet mignon tasted like it had been sitting in the freezer for a long time.  The filets had the texture of a pencil eraser.  They also came in a cheap, flimsy container and the grease was very, very cold--and had solidified--and the meat was lukewarm at best.  We tried to feed the meat to our cats who would not even eat small pieces of the filets; something was obviously off.  We pretty much had to throw most everything out--$282 totally wasted.  Go with Lincoln Square Steak instead.  I have had universally great experiences with them.",1,0,1,Gary F.,"Manhattan, NY",27,4,0

5.0,2/8/2019,As a former restaurateur I understand the importance of excellent service and food that is both appealing and appetizing. They say that there's no such thing as perfect but I beg to differ empire state house is perfect.  From the prompt and cordial manner in which I will see it to the knowledge into tentative nature of the waiter finished off with personal service and it in genuine interest in my dining experience offered by the manager Roberto. Everything was well paced and the lighting and music created an ambiance not to be taken for granted. The most important thing is that the food speaks for itself steak is  absolutely devine -amongst the best I've ever had and I've had some very good ones.  I used to come here often but I have  moved to another part of town I haven't been here in over a year and I am so happy to say that this meal was exactly the situation my palate and restless soul needed. I never have time to sit down and enjoy a meal bite for bite and I'm so glad that my decision to stop here was well justified. Kudos to the entire staff especially the manager Roberto for making me feel at home and delivering outstanding service and delicious food.yy,0,0,0,Ce-Ce C.,"New York, NY",0,1,1
4.0,2/5/2019,"I was staying at the hotel and didn't feel like venturing far and this was connected. They didn't have as many options outside of steak or seafood for main entrees as I had hoped (work trip so can only spend so much) and the wine was 15 a glass however the hotel offered a 15% off your bill coupon so that helped a bit. I went with the lobster ravioli which were actually REALLY good. They did supply bread and I was soaking up the extra sauce in that. Good size raviolis as well. I must say the wine was a healthy pour as well. They did have quite a few apps but that didn't fit my expense budget. As I mentioned, it's located connected to the holiday garden inn. It was a bit dark but I could still see. I sat at the bar though it wasn't crowded when I went around 8pm.  Decent option for hotel guests that isn't gross over fried food you normally find, just probably could find better prices if I was in the mood to walk a few blocks. I would go again though for sure if I was staying at the hotel for the quality food/convenience.",1,1,1,Gabrielle G.,"Willoughby, OH",37,177,20
5.0,2/4/2019,"I'm going to start off by saying I don't know why this place is not rated higher. We went last Friday for their Dinner Restaurant week. We arrived earlier than our reservation and they sat us down right away. I even requested a different table than the one they were going to initially give us and they were extremely accommodating. What I am assuming to be the owners came and personally greeted us at our table. Our waiter, Blermin, was also wonderful, very attentive but not in an overly invasive way. Our appetizers came out extremely quickly. I ordered the Oysters and my fiance ordered the Eggplant Parm. The oyster were lovely. My filet mignon for dinner was wonderfully cooked. I'm usually weary of steak houses because I am Argentinean and very particular (and obnoxious..) about steak! I really like the taste of the actual meat, and dislike when they add sauces or too much salt or pepper to the beef. Empire went above and beyond with my steak. It's definitely one of the best steaks I have ever had. It was not overly seasoned at all, and for a huge carnivore like myself, the taste of the actual beef really shined. It was a wonderful meal, the mashed potatoes and broccoli were really good as well. My fiance's prime rib was also ridiculously good, but if you like tender meat, I recommend going for the filet mignon. The prime rib although very tasty is a tougher meat. I almost couldn't even eat dessert, but it was all included in the restaurant week price. We shared a chocolate mousse and tiramisu, both plated with artsy drizzles of chocolate and home made HEAVY cream. The cream was delicious. Overall, the food was wonderful, the service was lovely and we had a really nice time. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone who enjoys a good steak!",0,0,0,Ivana R.,"Queens, Queens, NY",0,1,6

1.0,1/27/2019,"I had a terrible experience at this restaurant and will definitely not go back. The food was average but the restaurant itself is very outdated. The worst part of our experience was the service: from the moment we got in, we were greeted by a man at the door who looked and acted very mad, especially after we did not want to check in our coats. Once he showed us to our table, he told us we got lucky to get a table, even though we had made a reservation. Wait staff is very rude and not helpful at all, I was seating on a table where literally every second, the waiters would walk by and bump into my chair, and not a little bump. They would also just round up in one certain area and not be very helpful to any customers. The restaurant is very disorganized, runners/waiters don't know what table ordered what, i was presented with food/drinks that was not mince (this happened at least 4 Times). I'm not usually the type of person who writes restaurant reviews, but this was definitely one of the worst experiences I've had.

From beginning to end, everything worked out exactly as I wanted. We arrived at the restaurant and were escorted to the back table where the rest of the party was already waiting. She was definitely surprised and I appreciated all the little touches. The menu was customized and even read ""Happy Birthday Robin"" at the top. Our waiter was very friendly, always kept a smile on his face, and you could tell he was very well trained to deal with large parties. They even brought out a huge chocolate mousse cake (her favorite) with lit candles, and a group of the staff sang happy birthday, along with all her friends of course.

3.0,8/8/2018,"I came for Restaurant Week for lunch with a couple of friends. We were dining on the admittedly early side, but at 11:30 we were their first customers, and it was empty until well past noon. The front room has a bar and a bunch of colored lights, so we opted for the back room which was a little classier.Peeked at the regular menu and was happy to be taking advantage of RW ($28 lunch) here as steaks are pricey, though you can get pasta for under $20. RW menu is limited per expected, with sirloin, filet mignon, and a burger, as well as some non-red meat choices. We all opted for filet mignon, with different starters.Bread course typical but abundant. Soup of the day, minestrone, was good but nothing special. Filet was tender and cooked to the correct medium rare, but was drowned in a salty sauce. Sides were standard mashed potatoes and broccoli. Portions were decent, especially given the RW deal.We also got a bottle of the ""manager's special"" for $40, which ended up being a light and sweet Malbec. The waiter made a big deal out of decanting it, which is not typical for this young of a wine.Pacing was slow for lunch, especially given the empty restaurant, but service was friendly. Menu design, worn-down plates, and plating looked a bit cheap. Overall, it just felt tourist trap-y and average to me.

Being almost now 30 minutes for my meal I figured he never put the order in or it's been sitting for 15 minutes under the heat lamps.  This is how it went from bad to really bad in a matter of moments.Me: Since I still haven't received my order and it's been over 25 minutes let's just forget it.Bartender: It's really busy  do you want to come back and see the big group that just came in?   Me: That group just came in about 10 minutes ago why would that affect my order and did you really just ask me to go into the restaurant with you?  At this time it's about 6:15 and it was not crowded and the group he was referring to was about 7 people.  Then the manager comes up to me.Manager: I'm sorry your order is taking  a long time but It's Kobe Beef and it takes 25 minutes to cook.  The bartender should have told you. First, Kobe is a strain of beef, not a cut. If it really  takes 25 minutes to prepare the burger wouldn't it say that on the bar menu considering that this is a restaurant in the theater district catering to a specific crowd?At this point my burger comes out and before I can say anything the bartender comes up to meBartender:  You don't want it. He then tells the server to take it back before I can even respond.  It didn't even make near me.There were numerous positive scenarios that could have come out of this. 1.Bartender: I'm sorry.2. Manager/Bartender: sorry let me comp you a drink.3. Manager: sorry dinner is on us since it was our fault and we want you to come back.If your goal was to detour customers from  the neighborhood from becoming regulars congratulations, you have succeeded!

I'm saddened and angry by most of the under 5 ratings because most of them seem like people that can't afford the restaurant on a daily basis. When you go to a steak house it's going to be the best food for your money. The steak was so amazingly seasoned and great and the lobster ravioli was homemade and perfect.

4.0,3/3/2018,"Went with my family last night to dinner at Empire.  I was hesitant due to the 3 star reviews and I have eaten at the best steakhouses in NYC.  The place was empty when we arrived which made me nervous but the food was very good.  Drinks were just ok.  Wasn't the best martini I ever had but was good.  We had a bunch of bottles of wine that were very good. We had a ton of apps (bacon, wedge salad, tomato mozzarella) and all were great.  The bacon was my favorite.  Up there with the best of them.  Dinner I had the bone in rib eye.  Cooked perfectly medium.  It was well seasoned and the steak sauce was great.  The rest of the table had a bunch of filets and tuna.  All cooked perfectly.  Sides were very good as well.  Fries, mashed potatoes, broccoli and spinach. This place reminds me of uncle jacks.  It's not on the level of the top tier iv been to (peter Luger, Gallagher's, strip house,  old homestead etc) , but would recommend and I will definitely be back when I'm in the theater district.4star is right on.  Took off a star for service.  Asked waiter if things were gluten free he didn't know and had to ask.  Never came back and told us until I asked again.  Also didn't know the soup of the day and had to run and ask.  At the best steakhouse, waiters should know the menu inside and out for allergies and soup of the day.",0,0,0,Grant L.,"Roslyn, NY",1,47,19

3.0,2/5/2018,"I came for restaurant week, and like the overall score, I will give it a 3 out of 5. It's pretty average. I expected more when looking at their prices, and even though their restaurant week 3-course special at $42 is cheaper than their usual fare, it still didn't quite live up to that hefty check.Now, it was packed when I went, so definitely recommend getting a reservation if you do want to come. The bad thing was that there was really difficult to maneuver between tables to enter and leave. They really pack you in, so it gets a little noisy, and whatever nice ambiance they may have on a quiet night gets a little lost. It's also hard for a server to make it back to our back corner and also so busy we had a hard time getting his attention.For the first course, I got the tomato and mozzarella, and I'm not saying they have to be exactly in equal proportion, but the mozzarella was a lot tinier than I was expecting. It was nice, but I just wish I had had more of it. I tried a piece of the Canadian bacon, which was really juicy and more like regular bacon than I expected (since I thought Canadian bacon tended to be more like ham). The people in my party who got the calamari were happy with their choices.For the entree, I got the filet mignon which tasted pretty average in flavor, especially when I compared it to a bite of the ribeye, which had much better flavor. The ribeye came with a gravy, not sure why, it didn't need it. One person got the chicken parmigiana and it was a huge portion. I just feel like for a steakhouse, the filet mignon wasn't amazingly flavored like it should have been and like I've had elsewhere.So the only part I really loved was dessert. I had the cheesecake which was so soft in texture but still a rich flavor that I was fine with a plain cheesecake. A bite of the tiramisu was also really good. They were probably among the best things about the restaurant, but I'm not coming to a steak place for dessert. Would love to know if they outsource this, where they get desserts from.This is getting a little long, but I was not wowed compared to the prices I paid. Even though it seems typical for NYC, they charge like $4.50 for an 8 oz of Coke bottle and they brought the check before dessert without asking about splitting, which is more usual outside the city I guess. It was fine, but I don't think I'd come back to this location when there are other, better, similarly priced NYC steakhouses.",3,2,2,Stephanie G.,"Bloomfield, NJ",321,568,815

3.0,2/1/2018,"We decided to check this place out during restaurant week. The ambiance was  great: the decor, the staff. It all made me very eager to dig into what food they had to offer. I went with the restaurant week menu: fried calamari for a starter, chicken paramagiana for my  entrée and cheesecake for my dessert. Unfortunately, the food did not live up to my expectations. While the food was out in a timely manner, it was very subpar. The calamari didn't have much flavor and very much needed the assistance of the marinara sauce on the side. The chicken paramagiana was not paired well with the sauce it came with. The pasta was decent enough. The only thing I really enjoyed was the cheesecake. The texture was perfect; not too mushy and it was a relatively thick slice. I would say it was one of the best cheesecakes I've had. So all in all, decent experience just left disappointed in my meal. I think I would return in the future to give it another shot. Maybe it was a bad night.",1,0,0,Jordan L.,"Brooklyn, NY",152,4,2

3.0,1/25/2018,"During restaurant week, we always go to at least one steak house and this time we chose empire steak house. Mistakes were made. We arrived on time for our reservation at 2:15pm and got seated promptly. We were given the menu and our orders were taken quickly. That's where almost anything positive ended. The table next to us ordered around the time we did. A woman came and got seated around ~10 minutes after we ordered and ordered. She told the waiter she was in a hurry and if the food could come out quick but don't we all want our food to come out quick? I ordered the thick cut bacon as my starter and it lives true to it's name. It was thick and pretty good, not crispy but had a good fat to meat ratio. 45 minutes later, we got our steaks. I ordered the sirloin, medium rare. Upon first taste, I was disappointed. The taste was ok, bordering subpar. It was cooked to medium rare, that was the only positive about it. Flavor and texture were quite lacking. I had half of the ribeye, and that was levels better than my steak in terms of texture, flavor, and satisfaction. The sad thing is, it was only better due to my steak being bad. Generally speaking, the ribeye was quite standard. For dessert, I had the chocolate mousse cake which felt store bought.About the woman earlier, while our appetizers all came out around the same time, that was it. She then proceeded to have her entree, finished said entree, dessert, finished that, and paid for the check before we got our entree. Seems quite unfair to the people who had to wait 45 minute for theirs. Service definitely was terrible and even though it's only worth it for restaurant week, I still wouldn't come back.

One woman seated maybe 10 minutes after us got her entire meal and check before they cleared our appetizer plate away after we had finished 10 mins prior. I ordered the mixed greens for appetizer, which was a decent portion but lots of dressing. I tried some of the thick cut bacon which was actually pretty good, definitely thick cut. I would recommend the ribeye for the main course. It was cooked medium as asked and tasty, though I'm sure much of the taste was attributed to the fattiness of the cut. Each dish came with broccoli which was cooked wth garlic and not bad, not overly salty or oily which I liked about it. The bite of the sirloin I tried was really not that good. Lastly, the cheesecake for dessert was decent, but tasted like any storebought cheesecake. I give the food a 3.5 but the service about a 2.5, so it averaged to the 3 this rating shows.

My go to is the salmon which is also very flavorful and also has the nice crisp skin, just how I like it. The mashed potatoes and broccoli pairs great with it, but make sure you try the creamed spinach because it is delish! The chicken Parm is also a fave of mine, it is made so well with so much flavor. And you know a steakhouse is great when your favorite dish isn't even the steak because they do so many other dishes well. The star of this show is the chocolate mousse cake. It is the best desert I've ever had in my life, and I'm not exaggerating. Do yourself a favor and get a slice. Best part of empire is the service.

4.0,4/1/2017,"I was pleasantly surprised by Empire.  Billed as an offshoot of Peter Luger from way back, this location is built out of the Hilton Garden Inn.  We came as part of a larger party for my friend's birthday.  Walking in, the atmosphere is one of a generic NY steakhouse.  Staff was very friendly if a bit lingering.  It's strange that the bathroom isn't in the restaurant, but rather in the hotel itself.  Drinks were good although I wish the old fashioned I got had come neat rather than on the rocks; they didn't ask, which I most cases would mean the drink would come neat.  At least get nicer ice cubes if you're going to do that.We split 2 porterhouse steaks: 1 for 3 and 1 for 4.  I got my steak from the less well done one as I'll eat my steak blue if possible.  It was a medium in this case that was almost mid-rare.  The steak was very high quality and had clearly been dry aged.  It was melt in your mouth tender.  This was the best steak I'd had in some time.  We also got fries, mashed potatoes, asparagus, and sautéed spinach as sides, all of which were good.  All told this was well worth the price while still maintaining the classic steakhouse experience.Maybe this still isn't at the level of Peter Luger's, but not everyone wants to deal the bullshit over there every time.  I would definitely do Empire again.",3,0,0,Justin L.,"New York, NY",900,1005,34

2.0,2/8/2017,"I came here for dinner with a few friends as part of Restaurant Week, and I was fairly disappointed. The restaurant has a dark not clean appearance, and it's pretty small. The service was fast, and close to be rude/intrusive of a normal dining experience. As soon as one of my party friend finished his/her meal, a server quickly took away the plate, leaving the other still eating in a strange feeling of rushing. To start our bread and butter we're not so fresh. The bread was not warm, but you can feel it was. It also looked frozen and quickly defrost.Wine was fine. To eat I ordered fried calamari, filet mignon and chocolate mousse cake. The calamari were supposed to be an appetizer, but I received a huge portion, I barely finished with the help of my friends. Calamari were well fried. Maybe the best part of the dinner.The filet mignon was well cooked like I asked for, but I could not finish it due too much fat on a side. As sides there were some steamed broccoli and smashed potatoes, nothing crazy or particularly tasty.At the end I picked the chocolate mousse cake which was really sweet and heavy, and not so dark chocolate-driven. The cake was a paired with a huge side a whip cream. I am also surprised they didn't ask for any coffee and such.

1.0,1/31/2017,"I went into dining here with low expectations, thanks to Yelp, but my boyfriend and I still decided to tag along with our friends for restaurant week. I am somewhat sad we didn't suggest a better and more well reviewed steakhouse.Everything about this restaurant was just unpleasant - the service, the food, the location and the price.First off the service. I arrived first and was quickly seated. I told the waiter I was waiting for my friends but he still brought out bread and poured waters as if all my guests had arrived. By the time they arrived. The bread was cold and the iced water had melted.To eat, I had the tomato mozzarella, the filet mignon and cheesecake. The tomato mozzarella was fine. However, after the first course, the waiter awkwardly took away the plates as soon as someone finished, trying to rush the experience. For a main course I had the filet which was just a below par cut of meat. Half the piece was fat and I really felt cheated. I also found a hair in my food which completely grossed me out the rest of the meal. The sides, mashed potatoes and broccoli, were small and minute. Not enough for the plate.For dessert, I had the cheesecake which was pretty generic. The piece of cake itself was so tiny and it sat next to a huge clump of whipped cream. The whipped cream looked ridiculous on the plate.I can't tell you how much I disliked this restaurant. Me and my friends were probably the only locals in the restaurant and I can see why. I even have a stomach ache now from the meat. It just did not taste good. Also, there is no bathroom in the restaurant. You have to go into the hotel to use the bathroom.

Service was surprisingly impressive, I didn't expect much going into this place after all it was maybe 25-30% full on a Saturday night. But our server was impeccable and knew what he was doing, there when you needed him, but never nagging you. We ordered a half bottle of red, I think the terrazza, it was good but of course very overpriced for what it cost, but it was still decent for a cheap wine. Started with the tomato and onion, which was not as good as I remember it being at Peter Lugers, so skip for something else, maybe the bacon or wedge salad.I ordered a bone in Ribeye and my companion had the filet, both portions were massive and cooked absolutely perfectly, I order medium rare plus which is odd but they NAILED it even with a steak of this thickness.

3.0,10/22/2016,"Hospitality is the star of the meal here, but beyond that Empire Steakhouse falls flat. It is apparent from the moment that their bread is served that they strive to provide exceptional service; this is certainly trying to be a classy establishment competing with the NYC steakhouse greats. However, this type of service can be found at any number of quality steakhouses in the city. The decor is quite nice and the drinks are made well, but this ranks at three stars due to the kitchen. Opting to try Empire Steakhouse for a relaxed lunch, I ordered their signature 16oz Empire burger medium. While the burger was massive as advertised and at its size separating Empire Steakhouse from the other restaurants serving excellent burgers during the lunch rush it took quite a while to come out in an empty restaurant (which I wouldn't mind if it was done right) and when it did it was beyond overcooked. This was a well done burger that I had to add their steak sauce, a tasty vinegar base, to to enjoy while I normally would let the meat speak for itself. Unfortunately I didn't have the opportunity to really taste the meat due to it being sent out much more well done than ordered without even a trace of pink. I would have sent it back if I had the time to wait for another burger, and it likely would have been a fine burger made with good quality beef had it not been inexcusably overcooked. The steak fries accompanying it were tasty nonetheless. Considering this is a steakhouse incorrect temperature control is inexcusable. They should be able to make a burger medium. While I would consider going back to impress clients with the hospitality Empire Steakhouse is known for, when a steakhouse over or undercooks their beef it's a sign the kitchen has issues. They're not Peter Luger's as they're trying to imitate, but combined with the atmosphere Empire could be quite a suitable option if they cooked their meat properly.",3,0,1,Michael D.,"Brick, NJ",3,85,13

2.0,9/22/2016,There are so many terrific steak houses here in NYC so competition is fierce but Empire Steak House has made it easy for me to eliminate this from my list. I will admit the Empire Salad was excellent but it all went downhill after that. We were still eating our salad when the porterhouse steak for 2 arrived at the table. What? How? It clearly is NOT cooked to order as there is no way a porterhouse for 2 could be ready within 15 minutes of placing the order. I'm sorry but this is not a downscale restaurant and in any good restaurant the waiter will pace your meal and not bring out the main course before the SALAD (it's cold not cooked) is completed. But not only did they do this they actually moved our salad to the side of the plate so they could fit pieces of steak and broccoli on our plates. Maybe they are trying to be eco-friendly but when paying $95 for a steak we should get new plates. The porterhouse steak was just okay as there was so much grizzle through the steak. The $10 porterhouse I buy in the supermarket is a better quality than what was served to us. If you want a great meal with great service in this same neighborhood I recommend Red Eye Grille or Bar Americain over this place.,1,1,0,Stacy B.,"Manhattan, NY",2,6,0

Not the best I've ever had but it was good.I had the french fries with both meals and those were also disappointing.The employees are friendly and professional; and the restaurant is clean and comfortable...

I though this was an exaggeration...I was wrong. We were barely done with our apps when the main course came out, the waiters hovered while we ate and the second we were done we were asked what dessert we wanted. My girlfriend hesitated and asked the waiter which was better, the chocolate mousse or the cheesecake. He scribbled something down on his notepad and said you try one now and the other next time. Very faux pax in my book, especially for a restaurant identifies itself as an NYC steakhouse. I also witnessed the waiter rushing the couple next to us. We locked eyes after the waiter asked them to give him their entire order all at once (wine, app, main, dessert). Their eyes read ""is this real life?"". The food was ok.

They decided to bust out their own place after learning from PL. Walking in on the main side, I was ushered into a dark and mysterious spot. Beautiful linens and fixtures, Empire Steak House is set up for dining and decadence. My waiter comes over and asks if I'd like to start with a cocktail. If it were dinner time I'd want to start with a Talisker 10yr. Its noon so I have to keep sharp, wine's fine. And they have a nice wine list, I order an Argentina Malbec to get me in a steak munchin' mood.Now when it come to a Steak house for lunch, I'm a man on a mission. I'm not here to eat a salad son! I see they have a ribeye special. Usually I'd order a cream spinach side but I'm craving a potato hash with my steak for lunch. I start with a slice of thick cut bacon. Just like at Peter Lugers and Wolfgang's. Peter Luger's has mad skill with their bacon. This was good, thick slice. Mmmm...My steak comes out and its cooked perfectly. Here's the issue, and its not with the cooking. For a Rib Eye, I'm expecting it to be soft & juicy. The steak was a little tough IMHO. While I'm sitting and reviewing some paperwork, a large, loud obnoxious table of 8 sat behind me. There was a guy, he had a loud laugh like a hyena. And he'd laugh every 3 minutes. The tables around me all stopped when this jerk laughed. So much for dark and mysterious. There's hyena guy behind me, I'm getting a little agitated but dessert is coming. The table next to me (I sat first) the waiter goes to them, dessert? How about our Tiramisu? Lady diner: Tiramisu? What's that? Really? My nerves are jangled from Hyena guy, I wanted to get up and say: It's a coffee-flavoured Italian dessert made with lady fingers dipped in coffee, layered with mascarpone cheese!!!!!!!!!!!!  And shut up Hyena table!The waiter guy turns to me, I blurt out Tiramisu! He brings the table next to me their Tiramisu. The waiter guy turns to me, How about a slice of cheesecake? We just ran out of Tiramisu. Hyena guy rips out a loud fake laugh. Fine....Lady takes a bite of her Tiramisu and pushes the plate to the side.... I'm done at this point. I pay the check and ask where the bathroom is? Oh, though that door. Suddenly I'm in a hotel lobby?? And there is only one bathroom? And there are two ladies behind me??! Yeah.. I'm done with this place.

1.0,4/30/2016,"This place couldn't of been a bigger joke. The food during certain parts of the night was just ok but it was the employees and management who were such a joke. Myself along with five friends come into the restaurant expecting a great meal. The first order of bread they served us was so stale it was like chewing on rocks. They deeply apologized and gave us another basket of bread. My friend pulled a six inch hair out of his mouth which completely disgusted all of us. At this point we asked to speak to the manager about the situation. Once again he deeply apologized and said he would give us a bottle of wine and appetizer on the house which we obliged. What does this imbecile do? He gets us two of the ""market price"" seafood platters at $189 and tell us to enjoy which he then charges us latter on the bill after he said it was on the house.After bringing this to his attention he takes the seafood platter off the bill but then adds the bottle of wine he originally promised us back onto the bill. The bottle of wine was $70 but you can find it for $25 at wholesale. This is exactly when I knew what a joke this place was.

Our server was attentive and immediately brought out warm bread.  Our drink order was quickly filled and they kept my iced tea glass full.  My son and I had the filet and it was cooked to a perfect medium which is what I ordered and it was huge.  My loaded backed potato was also huge and overflowing with chunks of bacon and cheese.  There was a bowl of sour cream on the side.  Others had the Kobe burger, chicken Parmesan and lobster ravioli.  Would definitely return.",0,0,0,Donna R.,"Lithia, FL",0,16,0

4.0,3/14/2016,"I visited Empire during restaurant week, February 2016, and they did not disappoint! The place looked real upscale and the lighting made the place real intimate. The service was great from the time we walked in until we left. Our waiter was on point, attentive, and answered any questions we had. So we obviously did the prefix menu - I'm a non-pork eater so I couldn't order the Bacon appetizer, just a salad for me! - But for my entrée I had the T Bone steak and it was cooked perfectly, great seasoning, good char, I was in heaven! I was even sad when my food was gone but it was extremely memorable.   For dessert we had the cheesecake which was pretty good too.Overall we had a great time, the food was fantastic and the atmosphere was on point. Only downside was that there's no bathroom inside the restaurant, you have to walk out into the hotel next door to use the facilities and hopefully it's available because it's a single stall or you'll have to go to the other one in the basement.

4.0,3/9/2016,"This joint is right near my apartment, so it was just a matter of time before I wandered in. I'd been to the other Empire location a while back. It was okay; room for improvement there, but I still wanted to try this other location. I went with my wife for a quick dinner. Check it out:Flavor: 8I had the bone-in rib eye. It had a great sear and crust on the outside, and it was cooked to a nice medium-rare on the inside. There was not one drop of bleed-out, as the steak was properly rested before it was served. Aside from a bit of grizzle in one spot, this was a great cut of beef. Better than the other location.Choice of Cuts & Quality Available: 9Empire covers the basics in a plentiful way. They offer porterhouse for two, three, or four; ribeye; filet; strip; and even prime rib. To top it off there are veal and lamb chops too.Portion Size & Plating: 8Portions here are average to good. The creamed spinach is enough for two to share at $11. Even the creme brûlée dessert is probably big enough to share. At 22-24oz, the steak is a good size too.Price: 8Great prices here. Our bill was just over $100 because my wife didn't have much of an appetite.Bar: 10This is a great bar to hang out in. The bar room itself is beautiful, but not only is the atmosphere cool, but they have over 400 different bottles of wine and over 100 different single malt scotches - not to mention a serious bourbon and cognac selection.Specials and Other Meats: 9The great thing about this place is their pre-dinner price fix menu. At $49 you get a soup or salad to start, then either a filet or strip with crab cake or grilled shrimp, a side of either broccoli or mashed potatoes, and dessert. Awesome. I will definitely be back here for that deal.Apps, Sides & Desserts: 7Unfortunately, the chilled seafood platter missed the mark for us. The shrimp and lobster portions of the dish were just really bland and lacking in flavor. The lump crabmeat was excellent though. I noted the same problem in the review of the other location as well.I had to drown it in their steak sauce to get some enjoyment out of it.The creamed spinach was really good. It may have been a bit too salty, but I didn't necessarily mind too much.This creme brûlée is the best in the city. I'm serious. I've had them all over the place, and this shit was perfect. So creamy and light. Amazing texture and flavor, and just the right amount of broiled sugar on top.Seafood Selection: 8Aside from the chilled shellfish platter, I really can't make an assessment on this here. The shrimp and lobster cocktail in that shellfish tower were just no good. Not rancid or ""bad,"" they just had no flavor whatsoever. It is my hope that, based on the greatness of the lump crabmeat, some of the other seafood selections are better. I recall liking the oysters a lot at the other location, so there's that.Service: 10Our waiter, Tim, was awesome. We got to talking about cameras and photography when he noticed my camera, which he is currently in the market to get for himself. The rest of the staff were all very courteous and kind, and the service was FAST! We got our meal very quickly, and the servers were very happy to refill our plates with spinach and/or shellfish from the tower when we ran low. Decent bread basket, though not warm.Ambiance: 7This place was a little stale for me. I did like their private dining room, and loved the front of the house and bar, but the main dining hall was just lacking a little oomph for me. That said, does it really matter, as long as the food is good?",1,0,0,JohnnyPrimeC. C.,"Manhattan, NY",199,213,4300

3.0,2/23/2016,"In order to be fair, I am updating my review to include the night cap experience my wife and I had on Friday night. While Saturday night's dinner was a total let down and disappointment, our service in the front of the bar was far better.We had a couple glasses of red- the server was pleasant and very prompt. He was a man of few words but was cordial. What I did appreciate was the chivalry that was presented towards my wife as the server escorted us to the table and pulled out the bar stool for her. This is something I have noticed in the fine establishments around New York and was definitely present here, as well. I will say the feel of the bar area was very romantic and relaxing. The complimentary chips were a nice touch but a tad on the salty ide. One common theme with the Saturday night experience is that nobody smiled or showed enjoyment in their service. I'm not sure if this is a New York thing or what, but it would go a long way to making visitors to your city feel more welcomed and apt to spending a little bit more time and money wherever it may be. That said, this experience was much better then the next night. It's too bad the precursor ended up being better than the main event. People don't visit NYC to be cheap-we have money to spend and are willing to do it for good service and a nice experience-I'd be willing to try the bar again for another night cap and short menu, but that's about it.",0,0,0,George D.,"Liberty Township, OH",5,32,48

We sat at a comfortable side table and thank goodness we did because it was chaos in the aisles with wait staff going back and forth.Oysters - were okay at first but left a fishy after taste. Not as fresh as I hoped. Looked like it had good potential though.Mixed green salad - not bad but heavily doused in dressingLamb chops - salty.

However, it was an important lesson on how to order wine for dinner.So we ordered appetizers, the thick bacon and the calamari. For the entrees we both got steak. There were many to choose from. I forget which cut I got but it was delicious. They were served with mashed potatoes. We ordered a bottle of white wine from the restaurant menu for $40, much better deal than buying it by the glass. For dessert I got the cheesecake which was also pretty good. By the end I was stuffed and happy. The ambiance of this place is very romantic and more on the fancy end.

Overall it was very affordable to dine here during restaurant week.Cons: The service was horrible. I had made reservations and still had to wait 40 min to be seated and that was after I complained. We felt rushed during the whole meal since they would clear your plate very quickly and the host (a tall guy) would make gestures to the servers about us having to hurry. The last straw was when we were moved to another table so that the host could accommodate another large party and promised us another cup of wine for the trouble and then never brought it. We were there for about 1 and 40 min and half of that time I felt very uncomfortable.

4.0,11/3/2015,"Another great choice for steak in Manhattan. I've avoided this place as it adjoins Hilton Garden Inn and several really good steak houses in easy walking distance. Bar menu offers 8-ounce filet with 2 sides for $26, deal in the city maybe. I opted for the 16 ounce which was as good as you can get, served perfectly as ordered, sides excellent. Sautéed mushrooms above average. Like so many NYC steak houses, Empire has their own proprietary bottled steak sauce and so sugary it's not for my steak. Hard to beat Smith & Wollenski's or Peter Luger's steak sauces. You won't find Empire steak sauce at Kroger anytime soon. All-in-all Empire is excellent product at city prices, great service and presentation.

3.0,9/22/2015,I don't normally eat at steakhouses but this one was right at my hotel on 54th and 8th. The overall experience was good but could have been five stars. My friend ordered a steak but was not told until about 15 minutes later they had no more (got prime rib instead). That was a bit disappointing. I was interested in a caprese salad but was told they did not serve it. After peaking with another waiter a bit later about something else I brought up the caprese salad and he said they had them. I ended up ordering one and it was very good as were the pan-seared scallops. Being NYC you are to expect prices to be on the high end and this one certainly was ($45 for the scallops).  Aside from the shoddy service it was a pleasant evening.,0,0,0,David C.,"Derry, NH",1,55,0

As for the appetizer, the Canadian bacon and fried calamari both tasted really good. The fried calamari was actually really big and you can definitely share it. As for entree, the New York Sirloin and filet mignon were both really juicy and tender. The lamb chop and chicken were both juicy too and it weren't even dry. The creamed spinach and steak fries were excellent sides which were fantastic with the steak. As for the desserts, the carrot cake was amazing (not too sweet with the cream cheese- which is good since you won't be overwhelmed), the tiramisu and the chocolate mousse also tasted really good.

1.0,8/18/2015,"Went here for dinner during restaurant week and i will NEVER come back here again.  The ambiance is elegant although some guests arrived in jeans and flip flops.  We were seated without a wait, however our waiter never introduced himself or introduced any of the specials for the evening.  It took at least ten minutes to be given any water or bread.  We placed our full order of appetizer, entree, and dessert altogether.  After being served our appetizers,  it took quite some time again for our waiter to clear our table.  We remained polite throughout our serving even though our waiter never checked on us throughout our serving.Still wanting to be optimistic we thought our entrees would redeem the experience we were having so far...NOT!  This place is a waste of money and the food was not that great.  My salmon was very bland with not much flavor at all.  For a restaurant that serves a thousand dollar bottle of wine i expected the service to be far better than what we experienced, especially on a Monday evening where it was not busy and they had more than enough staff available.  I don't recommend this place AT ALL.  If i could give this place zero stars i would",0,0,0,Melinda P.,"Newark, NJ",0,1,0

5.0,8/8/2015,"I came here for my girlfriends birthday during restaurant week on a Sunday. I called to reserve a table and called in like 30 mins before my time and said I'll be late. That was no problem. When I got there, we were seated quickly. Food was great. I had Caesar salad for the starters, boneless ribeye for entree and chocolate mousse cake for dessert! My steak was cooked on point. I asked for medium rare and it came out just the way I wanted. My girlfriend had the sizzling Canadian bacon (thick cut) for starters which was really good and I should have gotten that instead, filet mignon for entree and cheesecake for dessert. Again, she really loved it so therefore I would recommend this place for some nice steak. Also, service was beyond great. Usually a lot of places treat you a bit differently because it's restaurant week and it's really packed so they're more just whatever about you because you aren't paying full price for food. So it seems like they lack attention on you. But empire steak house had the best service to their customers. I'm really bad with names so I forgot my waiters name but he made sure everything was on point. My water was filled everytime before I even had to ask. He was around everytime I needed something. Didn't have to search for him. There was a point in the beginning where we were ordering food, I mentioned ""oh let the birthday girl order first"" and he remembered. When her cheesecake came, it was lit with a candle and few waiters were around our table singing happy birthday.

3.0,8/3/2015,"I came here for restaurant week last week with my boyfriend, because $38 for a price fix with steak involved is a really great deal in manhattan. We had a reservation for 8:30 (it was a Friday), got there a little early, and sat at the bar for about 10 min. No big deal. The menu for restaurant week has pretty good entree options, but the appetizers aren't so impressive. Just your normal caesar salad or mixed greens, or literally sliced tomatoes and onions. I got filet mignon and my boyfriend got the rib eye, and both were tasty. Both entrees came with mashed potatoes and broccoli, nothing too fancy, but still tasted good. The service was only ok, because I had ordered a glass of wine and it took maybe like 15 min for that to be served, and it was served like a minute before the appetizers came out. My boyfriend asked for a second beer, and that also took forever. The manager was making his rounds to say hello to the patrons and we ended having to ask the manager for the second beer. Dessert was ok; I had tiramisu, which tasted really buttery so I couldn't finish it. My boyfriend ordered the chocolate mousse cake, which had a tasty cookie crust (like Oreos), which I am a fan of. Overall, the experience was fine if you want to pay a really good price for what normally might be a $40-50 steak entree.

4.0,8/1/2015,"We went here for Restaurant Week dinner and had a great time!  The food is very traditional but prepared well.  There are really no frills, flourishes, or fancypants touches, which is fine and expected, but they could probably work on, like, throwing a garnish here or there.I had the filet mingon and it was cooked perfectly.  Sometimes restaurants seem hesitant to give you a truly medium rare steak, but this was still pink and a teeny bit bloody in the middle and made all my carnivore dreams come true.  My boyfriend's rib eye was similarly quite tasty, and the bottle of house Malbec we split was delicious.A couple downsides: The tomatoes in the tomato/mozzarella starter were mealy and not flavorful.  And, like others have alluded to, the service was a bit forced -- our courses kept coming out one of top of the other when we weren't ready for them, and we definitely got the feeling that they wanted the table clear after dessert, so we had to more or less chug the half bottle of wine remaining.  (I should add that this was at 7PM on a Tuesday and the place was not crowded at all.)  The cheesecake was a very yummy finish, though, with tons and tons of fresh whipped cream.

When I'm spending about $50/person, I expect a certain level of service and Empire Steak House just didn't provide it. Here's where they went wrong:They had an extensive wine list, and I ordered a bottle of French red off the list. Alas, they didn't have the bottle in stock. They didn't tell me this for 10 mins after I placed my order. Fine, I can live with that. So I ordered a different wine instead. They brought out the entrees while my friend and I were only half way into our appetizers. I have never seen this before. I can understand this happening if the restaurant was busy, but there was only one other occupied table in the entire restaurant apart from us. There were actually more servers standing around than there were customers. We literally had to finish our appetizers while the entrees were sitting in front us going cold. Medium Rare Filet Mignon doesn't exactly taste fabulous while it's lukewarm. The food itself was good. Nothing to rave about. The bacon app was phenomeonal, while the filet mignon entree was really good.

But no amount of other factors can make up for food that's consistently lousy across the board. Neither of us really enjoyed ANYTHING we were served. 2 tiny exceptions: the butter was good. And I enjoyed the lone stuffed mushroom on the appetizer plate. It was the single tasty bite of the entire meal.If this restaurant were affordable, then having nonexemplary food might be forgivable. Not an excuse, but hey you supposedly get what you pay for.Well my dining companion & I paid, with tip, about 100 dollars for our meal.

It's sad.The  complimentary white bread rolls topped with onion flakes were of a cheap variety you might get in a grocery store. Not hot, fresh, or even warmed. In fact not very tasty at all. And stale. The low quality stale bread rolls, incorrectly made cocktail, and skunky seafood and generally shabby items in the appetizer platter made us so concerned about the quality of food that given the high prices we decided to just cut our losses by skipping entrees altogether and getting 2 cups of french onion soup and a caesar salad to share thinking they were classic items, standards on the menu and probably safe bets. We were wrong. They were both prepared incorrectly and poorly. Detailing the list of issues just seems unsportsmanlike and cruel but lets just say the food was an epic fail. Not recommended. At all.

The restaurant week meal options were pretty solid. I had the mozzarella and tomatoes for an appetizer, the filet mignon for my entree, and the carrot cake for dessert. Everything was tasty, though nothing was exciting or exceptional.While the physical aspects of the service were good, our waiter was overall quite bad.  When he was taking our order and I asked what the soup of the day was, he looked panicked and sputtered, and gave me a guess of what it was because he didn't know. I had to ask him to go find out....it was very strange. This guy later weirdly addressed all questions (how is your meal? More wine?) to the one guy at our table, even though someone else had ordered the wine. He also charged one of us who had a salad $3 for salad dressing that she didn't even ask for. Throughout the meal he proved to be quite unknowledgeable and awkward. Perhaps it was his first gig as a server...Overall, a pretty yummy meal. The steak was quite tasty and cooked just right.

Somehow half of the steak was well and the other was medium. It was fairly dry and needed more steak sauce to make it edible than a filet should. The ""German potatoes"" were hash browns essentially and were burnt and under seasoned. The asparagus were hard spears of nothingness. Overall. Not terribly impressed and overpriced for a disappointing meal. I would not return.I'm editing as the manager wrote me on yelp. He offered no means or mention to fix the issues in his establishment.

3.0,2/25/2015,"TL;DR Better Steakhouses out there.  No need to put this one on your list.I went here for Restaurant Week (which means eat steak week for me apparently), so take what I say with that in mind.  These guys apparently used to work at Peter Lugers and went off on their own to get some of that steak cashmoney.  From the way the sirloin was served to me, they are definitely trying to keep true to the style of the steak.  The food was good, but the reason why there's a 3 star up there and not a 4 or 5 is because at those price points, you better be great, even if it's restaurant week customers.  There's plenty of steakhouses in NYC and even in the area, why am I going to choose Empire Steak House.  There's also steakhouses people go because of the history and the whole experience and not necessarily the best food.  This place does not have the best steak and does not have the history to back it up.  Most people go to steakhouses for some sort of event (meeting long lost friends, anniversaries, birthdays, you know that mushy stuff) so they actually travel to a steakhouse.  It's not a deli where someone walks by and just pops in.  Are they trying to grab the people who couldn't get reservations at Peter Luger?  I don't know.  Anyway, you can go or you can not.  It was a good meal...for restaurant week (unlike my Delmonico's experience).  I ate:Fresh Mozzarella and Heirloom tomatoes:  why? because the bacon was only $5 so if i really wanted bacon I only need to pay $5.  Also I never ate mozzarella and tomatoes in a steakhouse and really don't understand it...but now after eating it...I still don't understand it.  Why would you pay $15 for tomatoes and mozzarella?  the tomatoes were...tomatoes and the mozzarella is an adult polly-o cheese stick.  don't get why people order it.Prime New York Sirloin:  MMMMM MMMMM.  I love steak.  Medium rare.  They cooked it great.  Nothing to complain about.  They served it like a porterhouse so they cut it up for you so you don't need to burn as much calories!  It came with a side of crappy mash potatoes and some good steamed broccoli for the poopy.Dessert Sampler (cheese cake, tiramisu, carrot cake, and chocolate mousse cake):  They waiter gave us the option to just have the dessert sampler so we can all try various desserts which was great on his part for offering cause i really wanted tiramisu.  We all did joke that they were probably running out of something and this was their way of controlling the inventory.  I HATE their cheese cake...or maybe I just hate cheese cake.  LIke the crust though.  everything else was good...nothing to rave about.  EXCEPT their carrot cake, that was some bomba$$ carrot cake.  I don't even like carrot cake.  but their's was bomb...BOOOMMBB",2,2,3,Vincent C.,"New York, NY",79,76,135
4.0,2/23/2015,"We came to Empire Steakhouse during restaurant week. When we first got there we were greeted by a hostess and seated in a dimly lit, white table cloth dinning area. Our waiter Tim came right over greeted us and gave us menus and water, and a basket of bread. We ordered a bottle cabarnet, and Tim brought to us within a few minutes, let us taste it, and than poured it into a decanter. The restaurant  week menu had many choices for the appetizer and entree. For the appetizer portion I ordered the soup du' jour which was split pea, and my boyfriend had the fried calamari. The soup was great, though my boyfriend did not like the batter that was on the calamari. For the entree we both ordered the NY top sirloin, which was 12oz dry aged and which came with mashed potatoes and broccoli. I ordered my steak medium, and he ordered his rare; we both got our steaks cooked to the correct temperature. The steaks both came on the bone, which tasted good, the only flaw of the steaks was the fat that was on the steaks, it was too much considering the oz of steak we had. The mashed potatoes were the best I ever had, the broccoli was great as well. For dessert we had a platter with cheesecake, tiramisui, and chocolate mouse that had two scoops of fresh whipped cream.

The Prix Fixe lunch comes with Salad or Soup, Potato and Vegetable, Dessert, and Coffee or Tea.It has been a bit of time since my lunch, but as I remember, the soup of the day was a Lobster Bisque, which was excellent.  Thick and flavorful.The  12 ounce Sirloin Steak is very good.  Not a fabulous cut of beef, but a very good one and perfect size for a lunch. It came perfectly medium rare. The potatoes and broccoli on the side of the plate were also good.Finished with some very good cheesecake and decaf coffee.The service was very attentive and caring.Very nice atmosphere.  Tables are spaced nicely.  Definitely a great place to go for lunch (or dinner), either for a business lunch or if you are a tourist in the hotels next door or nearby.",5,0,1,Randall S.,"Manhattan, NY",837,109,13
3.0,1/9/2015,"So there's two locations of Empire Steak House now, I think.  This one is located inside a hotel.  I think Empire serves a buffet breakfast to some tenants of the hotel in the mornings.I came here for a private event (awards breakfast) with some colleagues, so my experience may differ from others.  We had a private room in the back (nothing special or fancy - literally just a room with a table and chairs.I ordered steak and eggs (medium rare and over easy) - the steak was well seasoned and actually cooked medium rare, which for some reason I wasn't expecting, probably due to a bad experience with steak at a different award lunch somewhere else.  I was impressed.  My waiter apparently didn't know what eggs over easy was, and said ""sunny side up?"" which I suppose is pretty much the same thing anyways.  The red potatoes on the side were standard, though I did notice that I got about 1/3 the portion of potatoes that my coworkers got.  The food was good and the steak decent, but nothing I'd call home about.Based on this breakfast, I can assume that their lunch and dinner is decent as well.  Service was good, probably since we had our own private party.",4,0,0,Allene T.,"Manhattan, NY",2170,1311,3573

I like mine just pink in the middle but not charred on the outside. It was the biggest filet I have ever seen and it was done perfectly.

4.0,12/4/2014,"Empire Steakhouse is located on West 54th Street attached to the Hilton Garden Inn, close to Studio 54 Theatre. I only had to opportunity to dine at Empire Steak House one time, but it left me with a very favorable impression. It just so happened to be on Halloween, and we wanted to avoid the craziness from those that are in costume and party until dawn. Just the same, our reservation was ready when we arrived, but chose to sit at a table in the bar for a drink first. The hostess, who is strikingly pretty, seated us and even took our drink order.  I really liked the decor of the restaurant and lounge area, very well done and comfortable seating. There is outdoor seating when the weather permits. I ordered a mixed green salad ($11.95) and the prime rib ($49.00,) and both were very good. The beef is served bone-in, and I believe that it is broiled by the slice rather than baked as a complete roast and carved table side as is the tradition with other restaurants. That's OK with me, as the flavor was just fine. I noticed that a lot of NY'ers order meat well-done, which is puzzling because (in my opinion) it kills the flavor and toughens the texture. Oh well, I like Medium-rare, but ordered rare anticipating that the entree might come back slightly above rare given the regional preference. It was a good call !The service was fine all the way through. Everything was brought out on time, wine poured when appropriate, and plates taken as needed. Very nice. If there was any shortcoming, was that there was no bread delivered when we sat down, although our waiter asked us near the end of the meal if we wanted any more bread! No biggie and kind of funny too!  My thoughts on Empire Steak House are that it is an excellent choice and a reasonably good value considering the Midtown location. With a bottle of wine, two entrees, two salads, one tartufo desert, one after dinner drink (Remy Martin XO) and a 25% tip, the bill was around $315. There are many other steakhouses in NYC & Brooklyn that might be considered higher-end. They will be more crowded because of their namesakes but you will not have an appreciably better meal and will certainly pay more for the experience.The only drawback to Empire is that it is connected to the Hilton Garden Inn, and to use the lavatories, you must walk into the lobby of the hotel. Again, no big deal.....unless it is closed for cleaning service!

Now if you're a slow eater, then this is no problem, but for anyone else it takes a while to get noticed.Food was pretty unimpressive. I liked my cream of mushroom soup.

Decent service from the waiter considering it was a packed Friday night. Calamari appetizer was good - crisp batter and tender rings. The sirloin was fine...tender, cooked medium as I ordered it. Just not amazing, not spectacular, not the depth of flavor I expect from aged beef at a nice restaurant. Tiramisu was excellent...as far as flavor. My dining companion ""accidentally"" also ordered tiramisu (I was having expresso and tiramisu, he also wanted expresso, somehow we both ended up with expresso AND tiramisu...hmm). Anyway, his piece ended up being literally double the size of mine. Wtf? Gender bias?Another oddity is that the bathroom is located in the lobby of the adjacent hotel, so while not leaving the building, you technically leave the restaurant. There is only one ladies room in the lobby to serve both the restaurant/bar and the hotel's needs, so it's either wait for the diva in front of you to primp and polish or hoof it down the stairs to parts unknown in search of facilities....ok, I'm being a little dramatic. It's probably not a long walk, and probably just as nice as the upstairs bathroom. The point is, the bathroom should be inside the restaurant in the first place dammit.

My dessert was carrot cake with fresh whip cream and it was heavenly. The service was great and our waiter was funny and attentive.

2.0,5/19/2014,"They need to work out some serious kinks.Went there pre-theater on Saturday. It's quite large; low lighting, high ceilings, white tablecloths and lots of staff everywhere; felt like a typical high-end steakhouse. Our particular waiter had a bit of an edge to him and he messed up the drink order.  A few of the other young men that worked there were much friendlier and cracked smiles once in a while. We started with raw oysters and clams. The oysters were decent, but I've had better. They weren't shucked very well and one of them had a piece of the shell stuck in the oyster. On the positive side, it's a nice touch to have the staff take the oysters from the cold dish and plate them for you.But....the fire alarm went off. Look...this happens from time to time and thankfully we patrons weren't roasted along with whatever else was cooking in the back, but it took them an exceedingly long time (way over 20 minutes) to turn the alarm off. Thankfully the loud siren was terminated, but the bright flashing lights went on and on and on and on...it was awful. I started to get a headache and we were considering just having the main course canceled when they finally figured out how to kill the seizure-inducing lights. It was less than pleasant...although it's always fun to see NYC Firemen passing by the table with all of their equipment during dinner. Felt like part of the show.The restaurant didn't get very busy (which surprised me), so many of the staff seemed a bit lost at times.Anyway, the food was decent - I had the sea bass which was simply prepared - it had a slight crunch on the outside and was flaky otherwise. My dining companion had the filet mignon which was very good. Steamed asparagus on the side was nice - served lukewarm.The fire alarm fiasco wasn't handled very well by the management. We said something to the floor manager on the way out and he offered to buy us a drink...but that should have been done for everyone that was in the restaurant proactively (there were only about 6 or 7 tables that were actively dining during the fire alarm).From what I know, this is a new (2nd?) location for Empire Steak house, so I hope they get their stuff together.",1,0,0,Jody W.,"Gansevoort, NY",213,986,2958

2.0,3/17/2014,"Honestly I was prepared to give a 5-star review but now that I see what they did with the Tiramasu there is no excuse for it and I am sadly disappointed. Such high prices for ordinary everyday food (Steak, with Broccoli and Mashed Potatoes), and they had the audacity to cut it in half because it was Restaurant Week. OK, Here is my original review:The ambiance was good for a group. The service was excellent. Waitstaff very polite and attentive. Good door greeting. I had the Fried Calamari - 2nd best I've had - First was in Rome, Italy. Filet mignon with mashed potatoes and broccoli..a RW staple. Tasted excellent size of filet was a tad on the small side. Pretty Good mushroom sauce. Tiramasu dessert delicious but a supermarket sample sized portion was ridiculous. Don't know whose idea that was. Tasted just like what I cook at home. I am an excellent cook, but this is the first time I got my own flavors at a restaurant.                  __________                      _______________OK, so now I must add this ~ I was disappointed since it tasted the way it does when cooked at home. I know that sounds strange since I said I am a good cook, but for a pricey restaurant I thought I would get a treat and taste something different.The reason I am also now disappointed is that I was extremely puzzled at the size of the Tiramasu.  It was literally the size of A HALF of a saltine cracker cut diagonally. Now I see what happened from the pictures I see here of someone else's dessert. They literally took an average sized portion of the dessert and cut it in half and served it to the 2 of us who had ordered it. We were a group of 8 and the average cost per person was $70 except for the people who did not drink the house wine we ordered.For an average bill of $500 (No Cocktails)  you couldn't give the 2 of us the whole piece each?
