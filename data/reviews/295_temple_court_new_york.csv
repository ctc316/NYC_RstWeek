5.0,4/8/2019,"Temple Court is located inside The Beekman Hotel, where we stayed on our recent visit. We had a fantastic brunch at Temple Court and highly recommend it. First, the atmosphere is very cool. I love a restaurant that has been professionally designed and oozes luxury.  Second, our food was simply delicious. Their bacon is the thickest cut bacon I've ever seen and now I want it everyday.  Our meals were divine and my husband even ate there the second day too. I certainly recommend Temple Court.",0,0,0,Ashley R.,"Charlottesville, VA",0,7,9

3.0,3/27/2019,"Temple Court is an absolutely STUNNING location for brunch. The room is wonderfully decorated with beautiful lights, art and shelves showcasing various books and items from stuffed birds to tea sets. The main room has an open ceiling which shows off multiple floors above, topped with a huge skylight. It gives you a quite upscale, fancy feeling walking in. We arrived for brunch at 1230. There was a lovely singer and bass player. They sounded wonderful. We were seated at a table near the back wall with a nice view of the performance. The table, while cute, was not very comfortable for eating. The seats were very low and deep. It was much more suited for just lounging rather than a meal. We started off ordering a round of cocktails which are priced at $16. Mine was delicious with orange and a brandy cherry. My friend got the last one on the brunch menu but unfortunately, they did not have orange espresso. They made it, but it was not very tasty so she got a wine instead. We started with te burrata which is served with squash and pomegranate. It was beautifully plated and the flavors worked very nicely.  For entrees, we ordered the baked eggs and the country omelette. The baked eggs do not come with any bread (which is just wrong in my opinion) so we got a side of the multigrain. The food was absolutely delicious. The cauliflower was perfect and the sauce that accompanied it was very tasty with a little spice. The multigrain toast was perfect for scooping up the runny yolk and the tomato sauce.  However, we were sitting at the edge of those low chairs and even sitting up as straight as possible, the food was only about 6-8 inches below our faces. It was rather uncomfortable to eat like that. We ended the meal with the baked alaska. Since it was one of our birthday's the server put a little candle in it (and we avoided a birthday song from the jazz musicians because SOMEONE doesn't like the attention). The baked alaska was really good. I normally do not eat dessert but this was a perfectly decadent meal ender and would honestly think about coming back just for one of these bad boys. The food overall was great. I loved the space and the jazz brunch. The tables were just SO uncomfortable. It was very expensive. For three people, it was 200 with our tip (which is a bit more than I would normally pay for unlimited brunch). As it was for a birthday celebration, the fancier meal was accepted but I would not choose to come back for just any old brunch day.",2,0,0,Erin P.,"Brooklyn, NY",340,314,1082
3.0,3/24/2019,"I did not eat at the restaurant so this review is for the bar/lounge only .Upscale place for sure with a sluggish/I couldn't be bother attitude from some of the bartenders and hosts .It would have been appropriate for the bartender that served us that evening to tactfully inform us also that champagne will be $35/glass.It's not about the money, it is more about the principle I believe... Otherwise the place looks like a well done Hollywood set .Will shrug my shoulders if my friends want to go back there....",0,0,0,Frederic B.,"New York, NY",0,6,0
3.0,3/22/2019,"Temple Court is a very upscale, dressy restaurant. As part of my Amex FHR benefits, I was credited up to $100 to dine here. The service was extremely slow at first. It took our server 30 minutes to get us our menu and water. My boyfriend had to calm me down. Other than that, as soon as our server gave us our menus and started paying attention, service was better. Our table ordered Hamachi for starters. I forgot what was in it, but it was really delicious and ingredients were fresh. For our main entrees, party and I ordered two dishes to share: 1/2 Lobster and Baked Alaska. The Salmon in the Baked Alaska MELTED in my mouth. The citrus touch on the sauce was very fun and needless to say, all the ingredients were top-notch high quality. Besides the service, my experience here at the Temple Court was great! Would I come back here? Honestly, I wouldn't be too sure. For those who would like to break away from the crowd should definitely check out Temple Court--there were plenty of empty seats when I was here.

1.0,3/3/2019,"I can  not speak on dinner but I can speak on my awful breakfast. I stayed at The Beekman and headed downstairs for breakfast. I ordered the breakfast sandwich and asked for the spicy aioli on the side. I get the sandwich and it is loaded with the aioli. I asked politely if I can get one without. The waiter happily obliged as it was an error. The new sandwich returns rather quickly. It is then I take a  bite not only was my sandwich cold and my bun stale,  they simply just scraped the aioli of my last sandwich with still a heavy amount of it on the bun. I returned the sandwich and the waiter was extremely apologetic. I was really looking forward to my breakfast to be  really disappointed. Only plus was the fruit side dish was fresh.

4.0,2/10/2019,Their food definitely beats my expectations after reading all the yelp reviews. I thought the food would be just ok but it's actually pretty good. We had pasta and hamachi for appetizers. Then we had the duck and beef Wellington as mains. We finished with the baked Alaska and strawberry shortcake.

5.0,2/10/2019,"Hands down the best meal! I went for Restaurant Week lunch and did the app, entree, and dessert deal for $36 (which is such a steal).I started with the gnudi which was absolutely delicious. Every bite was consistent and a flavor bomb. The fried Brussels sprouts and fried sage perfectly complemented the cheesy goodness of the gnudi. I will definitely order this dish again and recommend it to anyone that goes.For my entree I had the Chopped Steak. Although it was ground beef, it was flavorful and seasoned really well. The cheese and bread complemented the steak itself perfectly. The dish was also very pretty for being ground beef.I was full but couldn't pass up the Baked Alaska. The presentation was excellent. And every bite was delicious. The gooey chocolate cake on the bottom was great with ice cream in the middle (which was not what I was expecting!). Amazing food with very friendly staff!

4.0,2/10/2019,"We went for lunch during restaurant week and we were seated promptly although it was packed.  It is a beautiful and cozy yet comfortable space. Our server Zach was knowledgeable and polite. I will start with the only negative in this review. The service was definitely lacking since the restaurant was so busy. We noticed all the diners were being served rolls, we asked the busser for rolls, then we asked another server, then our server, 3x we asked before we got served. Now the food, 5 stars for that. Like other reviewers stated the full menu was presented for restaurant week. I ordered the Waldorf salad and my friend the beet salad for apps. Both were fresh and delicious. We upgraded to to the hanger steak medium rare. It was tender, flavorful and accompanied by mushrooms and Brussels sprouts with fingerling potato's in a delicious light sauce. We both cleaned our plates and split the millefeuilles for dessert. Don't miss that when you go. I took advantage of restaurant week(s) and out of the 5 restaurants I tried this was by far the best.

4.0,2/9/2019,"My coworkers and I came in for lunch for restaurant week and had a nice time. We were seated right away and started off with some delicious bread. I loved how large the selection on the menu was. Usually places have about 4 choices for each course for restaurant week but temple court had a large list for both the appetizers and the mains. To start I got the gnudi, which as I learned are a lighter type of gnocchi made with ricotta cheese, with brussel sprouts. This was the absolute highlight of the meal!! I would get this dish a million times over again and recommend everyone tries it! I loved the lightness of the gnudi paired with the crisp brussel sprouts and the sage, apple, brown butter sauce they were in was one of the most delicious things I've ever ate. Please do yourself a favor and try this dish!For the main I got wild salmon with grains and beets. The fish was cooked very well, it was delicious. The grains were a nice addition to the plate but although the beets were also good, they seemed to overpower the dish a bit. It had a very strong beet flavor which I felt like was too much for the dish in my opinion. Overall though our time was great and the service is very quick and attentive. As I mentioned before, definitely try the gnudi!",3,0,2,Alina V.,"New York, NY",257,274,682

3.0,2/6/2019,"I went in for the restaurant week lunch and was a little underwhelmed. The ambience and staff were both super lovely, no complaints there. The restaurant itself looked AMAZING! Sadly the food wasn't quite as good.The gnudi appetizer was actually in general very delicious! But it was clear that care hadn't been taken with it, the garnish of fried sage leaves and Granny Smith apples was more like RAW sage and two tiny pieces of apple. The gnudi themselves were amazing, hats off to the pasta chef, but he was let down by his support team.The cassoulet, which was recommended by multiple staff, was similarly underwhelming. The duck was super soft, which I loved, but there was a LOT of unrendered and flabby fat that was kind of unappetizing. It was nice and rich, but after a few bites I was longing for something to add brightness or lightness to the dish.Overall the food wasn't bad, but it just wasn't worth it for such a supposedly fancy place.Oh also, they messed up my reservation (no biggie, they were able to seat me anyway) and as I was leaving I overheard there was another reservation mishap so if you do decide to fo I'd call ahead just to make sure everything is okay before you get there",0,0,0,Ming L.,"Manhattan, NY",20,12,6

2.0,2/2/2019,"I was excited to go to downtown NYC, where I spent much of my childhood and youth.  The City Hall area still has the desolate, cold charm I remember.  Now, this place is a Must See!  I would definitely go back for a drink and apps in the lounge, with its two story glass ceiling and vintage mezzanine.   It was totally happening, in a good way, with a fabulous crowd.The dining room was very nice, LOTSA space between tables with booths along the wall.  It was the day after Thanksgiving, and was at most half empty during our dinner.  Why?  NYC was packed for the holiday weekend.  Our ""Man"", seemed to be the waiter/server for the entire room and was delightful and gregarious.  A total plus on what became a series of minuses.  This was a reunion for me and my two gals, and we had the best day, going from the Warhol at the Whitney to Temple Court.We ordered the Baby Lettuce Salad which was $18.  It was unremarkable to say the least and big rip off.  What a joke, except it was not funny.  Mains were Dover sole and monkfish osso bucco.  The gals thought the sole was good, I thought it was on the fishy side and lacking that special thing the most expensive fish on any menu has.  The monkfish had flavor and was properly cooked, however it was lukewarm on the outer edge and was cool in the middle.  No bueno.  Along with the mains we were given fried potatoes and sautéed greens.  We nibbled, we do not do fried and already had a salad.  We thought it came with the entrees and did not question it.When I got home I saw that were we charged $9 each for something we did not order, plus tax and 25% tip.  I emailed the place and this went back and forth for months, now I give up.  I DO NOT give money to a millionaire celebrity chef.  Period.  Sum up - mediocre, misfired food, rip offed by the place, bitter espresso (really, sent it back and they brought another bitter one) stunning lounge.  Boring dining room.  Now we know why.  TOM COLICCHI NO!",0,0,0,Steven G.,"Miami, FL",28,96,13

5.0,1/26/2019,"Went here with a friend to check out their restaurant week selections. We were arriving after seeing a musical on Broadway so we didn't get there until 10pm on a Thursday night and there was still a decent amount of people in the restaurant.Unlike most other RW menus, this place basically has their whole menu available with a few dishes with supplements of $5 or $10.After perusing the menu, I decided to go with the burrata, the salmon, and the baked alaska. They started us off with a fresh baked roll and amuse bouche--both of which were very good and had an interesting texture and flavor.The burrata was great--the cheese was just as you would expect, but when paired with the squash and basil pesto and sage, it was out of this world--and it was a decent size as well.I also had a few bites of my friends sweet potato agnolotti, which was absolutely delicious--with perfectly al dente pasta and brown butter sauce that was to die for.Even with those fabulous appetizers, the salmon may have been even better. I can easily say it is one of the best--if not the best--salmon dishes I have ever had the pleasure of eating. It was a good size and cooked absolutely perfectly. The cabbage and citrus were a nice touch as well, but the fish impressed all on its own.For dessert, we split the baked alaska and the millefeuille. Both were excellent and were plated marvelously. I give a slight nod to the baked alaska because the richness of the chocolate paired with the banana ice cream was divine. That being said, the millefeuille had a similar vibe as it also had chocolate and banana ice cream--and was also a very good dessert.Overall, this place served up some amazing food and was probably the best $42 you'll ever spend in NYC. Everything was super high quality and had great flavor and all the dishes were sized as they would normally be even if it was not RW. The service here was also super friendly and attentive and the food came coursed out appropriately. This is definitely a spot worth heading downtown for, and is--in my estimation--the best RW deal in town.",2,0,2,Ryan R.,"New York, NY",746,1843,225
4.0,1/25/2019,"We came to Temple Court for restaurant week on a chilly Friday night in January. We had reservations for 6pm, and arrived early. Fortunately, the hostess had seated us gladly. While we were seated in the main area, we only had access to the restaurant week menu and not the bar menu. We were slightly disappointed as their website's restaurant week menu did not match the menu that was provided to us (no oysters or gnudi ) Despite this, the selection of items varied and choosing my appetizer, entree, and dessert was difficult as many of them sounded so good! For my appetizer, I chose the cavatelli with pork sausage. It was delicious and the portion was quite substantial. It had a nice amount of heat from the chiles and was well balanced with the ricotta. To share, my friend ordered three different cheeses. The plate contained some candied pecans, apricot, and honey. The cheese that was paired with the honey was my favorite, it was so so good. For dinner, I ordered the chicken fricassee. It had a rich flavor but was tasty. The chicken was moist and the brussel sprouts and squash were too good that I wished there were more of them!For my dessert, I ordered the millefeuille. It was heavenly! The chocolate and banana complemented each other so nicely. I finished my meal with a cup of black tea which was accompanied by warm milk. Who knew warm milk would be so nice? Also, It would be wrong of me to not acknowledge how attentive the service was here. Simply impeccable. I don't think my water glass was ever empty.As a side note, my friend and I had some leftovers and asked that our food be wrapped up to take home. The waiter gave us a coat check ticket and told us to pick up our food once we were ready to leave. It was pretty comical because we didn't check our jackets, and didn't quite understand why we were receiving a coat check ticket. I guess this place frowns upon having boxed food on the table?

4.0,10/5/2018,"Temple Court is a pretty swanky bar located inside the Beekman Hotel. It was renovated about 2 years ago. The inside decor and ambiance is amazing. The bar sits under a giant Atrium that looks up to where hotel rooms are and has a skylight. The place is decked out with plush seating, lamps and carpet. It feels very old worldy and luxe, an escape from the outside.I've been here a few times now. A work event, a date and a casual drink at the bar. It's a great date place - you can sit on a comfy couch and drink nice cocktails. It has a cool and romantic vibe and the seats are spaced out enough that you can have a private conversation. For work events there are private areas and it is a classy place to bring clients. For drinks, it's also perfect - if you can get a seat. Late night mid-week (after 10pm) it will only be half full but at 6pm its bumping. And they don't take reservations.I've had a few cocktails, wine and beer here. They have a unique cocktail menu as a guide but the bartenders can easily whip up something classic or bespoke. I've had pretty sold old fashioneds and mezcal-based drinks. They also have good wine and IPA options. It's on the pricier side and the cocktails are not cutting-edge, but it's in keeping with the venue and location.One thing I will take off a point for is the all-day bar food menu. Being that I'm vegetarian they don't have much that's exciting or substantial for me - steak and salads etc. The cheese plate option is a saving grace. However, I'd probably be discouraged from staying here for the long haul on account of the limited food choices. Unless I was specifically aiming to get hammered.To conclude - definitely recommend stopping by for a drink. The venue is stunning and always a nice experience.",0,0,0,Cri C.,"New York, NY",283,238,1702
5.0,10/2/2018,"The decor and ambiance are something of the roaring 20's. It's a spectacular space! The service was fun, our waiter was attentive but somewhat cheeky and reminded me of certain sitcom experiences I've witnessed based around prestigious NY restaurant dining. The food was impeccably plated and tasted even better! As a bonus it was restaurant week unbeknownst to us so we got a real deal! I had the Gnudi as my first course, the pillow soft clouds of deliciousness burst with richness and was perfectly balanced with the sage and brown butter. I had the swordfish for my main and it was cooked to perfection and paired beautifully. Dessert was baked Alaska which was a first for me and my dessert life has forever been changed!

4.0,9/21/2018,"Designed with high style & jewel tones, Temple Court is a restaurant located in the equally beautifully appointed Beekman Hotel. We wouldn't normally pick an eatery in a hotel, especially one so posh, but we were staying in the area & had planned to check out the Beekman for future accommodations. Temple Court was too gorgeous to say no to. The Breakfast Sandwich was exceptionally well constructed, not too big that it fell apart when set down & each ingredient was in perfect proportion to the others. A poppy seed bun held together fluffy eggs, crispy bacon, spicy aioli, & a fried green  tomato. Hearty & made you feel like you were eating something healthy, the Heirloom Grains & Sunny Side Up Egg has avocado, tomatoes, chives, goat cheese & a side of fancy-ass toast with nuts & more grains. We made the mistake of each getting a side of potato rosti (hash brown cake) as the meal as a whole was already filling.Laid back service; a simple, yet exciting menu; & decor that is delicious eye candy.",5,4,6,Fancypants X.,"San Francisco, CA",188,2067,3312

Second, I ordered the trout and was pleasantly surprised to see the huge portion size in a very delicately crafted the dish. It was delicious and I could clearly tell that they put a lot of effort into making it. It felt like it was worth more than the price they charged.

5.0,8/17/2018,I came here two days in a row for lunch. This place was that amazing. The restaurant week menu was extensive and I enjoyed myself so much that I had to come back the next day to try other things on this menu. Everything I had was simply amazing. The flavors and freshness of the ingredients were on point. The portions were just right. The fish was cooked perfectly. I can't rave about this place enough. I came to celebrate a milestone birthday and they printed a personalized birthday menu with my name on it! What?! The bread is so amazing too. Crunchy outside soft and chewy inside. Even their butter was perfect. Not frozen and perfectly spreadable. Even typing this makes me drool.

The pesto gnudi was so soft and pillowy! And the foie gras with the strawberry and pistachio was a great compliment and cut the earthiness  perfectly. For entrees we got the braised lamb (so good I got it twice) and lobster which was actually lighter than expected but not in a bad way as the portions were quite large.

3.0,8/10/2018,"I had such high expectations about this place since it is by no other than Tom Colicchio. I had the Beekman Breakfast that consists of eggs(I had mine poached), toast, potato Rosti, and choice of bacon( mine is thick cut). The bacon was so dry and hard, isn't it supposed to be lightly crisp outside and juicy and tender on inside? I've had thick cut bacons at other establishments and not cooked like this. Made me so disappointed I should have probably ordered thin and crispy ones instead. The potato Rosti was also hard and it wasn't serve with any sort of sour cream. I had to ask for some butter and jelly to go with my toast because the breakfast itself was so dry, the saving grace were the poached eggs and the outstanding service of the staff.

5.0,8/3/2018,"Attended this restaurant with three friends for lunch during restaurant week. The space is small but elegant with an old New York feel. Although the crowd in the restaurant portion was slightly older, there was an adjoining bar/longe area with lots of sofas and a slightly less stuffy vibe. The food was a limited menu but very well done. We all chose different apps so everyone could try them and they were done extremely well. Portion size was smaller but not unfilling. I did notice a larger amount of seafood on the menu than anything else. I choose a pasta appetizer and a shellfish stew for entree and both were incredible. Others at the table chose different fish filets and all were done perfectly.From a restaurant perspective, the service started out great and then trailed off as the restaurant filled. I would probably recommend this more for dinner than a quick lunch as they are definitely more used to a dining experience instead of a working lunch. I likely will go back just for that.

3.0,7/27/2018,"I came to the Bar Room at Temple Court for dinner last night. The entrance is kind of a mess-- dozens of people waiting and no one seemed to be directing people. I found my party at a round table that was a little tight for 4 (and definitely too tight with my addition). One of our members sat on a stool the whole time.My party had ordered before I arrived, and things came out quickly, in three loose waves. The most notable dish for me was the chopped steak dish, which felt like a deconstructed hamburger. Quite delicious.We ranged through the majority of the menu, including crispy artichokes, stuffed sage leaves, steak tartare, mixed baby lettuces, prawns, hanger steak, burrata, duck confit, and a pasta. All good examples of each dish, with high quality ingredients, but nothing to make them special. Portions somewhat small to eat tapas-style as we did.The meal felt somehow anonymously modern to me, despite the gilded age setting. Not every restaurant needs to have a strong point of view-- I can enjoy an ego-less nice restaurant that simply gives you that steak or grilled fish you've been craving-- but something about it felt empty to me.The space is stunning, and I would love to come here for a quiet brunch. However, the bustle of the space and our close seating arrangement were distracting. Service was very personable but somewhat disorganized (e.g. brought the wrong dish, couldn't find a wine list).Pacing was quite quick at 45 minutes in and out. Let's tack on another 15 for those who arrived before me and that's an hour; that's a bit rushed for me, but if you need something quick and high-end in FiDi this is your ticket.Wine list extensive, with typical high markups but some nice sub-$100 options. Strong focus on France, and specifically Burgundy. One nice bottle for us and one dud (with a direct correlation to the price).For me, it just didn't add up to the ~$125+ per person post-tax and tip that I spotted on the receipt. I'd try them again for a cocktail, or in a pair rather than a large group, but this just didn't work for me for a group dinner. Rounding down from 3.5 stars.",6,1,2,Liz S.,"New York, NY",952,772,1843

My favorite part of this meal was the crepe cake topped with strawberries served at the beginning of the meal. Ugh, it was out of this world. Light and airy but delicious.

We were all business people who entertain often and all disappointed- non will return- typical diner food and not worth the price. To go into detail on every sub par dish that was ordered would be equivalent to reliving it again-just horrible. Mr Collicchio should hire someone to oversee his kitchen or it will not be around another year- went for drinks at the lounge 2x in the last few weeks and both evenings Temple Court was completely empty and the bar was packed- I assume most people will try Temple Court 1x because of it's beauty but not return. How can this restaurant be completely empty on a Thursday and Friday evening???

4.0,2/15/2018,"Absolutely stunning gem in the Tribeca-World Trade area! If you are willing to shell out a lot of cash, then this is a great place for dinner and drinks.My friends and I came here for Restaurant Week Winter 2018, and we had a blast! When you walk in, the front desk asks you if you have a reservation. There is a bar, so you may not need a reservation for that, but you may need one to sit in the luxe sofas in the lounge -- and I think the lounge is for drinks only. Dinner takes place in the main dining room, which looks deceptively small, but it can seat a lot of people. When we got there at 6PM, it wasn't crowded, but by the time we left, every table was full.We had the best server - Jamal - as he gave us great recommendations for our entrees and cocktails. Before the appetizer, we were served this one-bite appetizer of squash with  vinaigrette. So delicious! We also had a bread roll - this roll was beautiful: crunchy on the outside (also super hot to the touch, so you knew it was fresh), and if you were able to open it (we all had to wait at least two minutes before doing so), super soft on the inside. For the starter, I had the Ricotta Gnudi (gnudi [like gnocchi pasta] with brussels sprouts, chestnuts, brown butter and sage). This was pretty good - and this is coming from a person who isn't a big fan of gnocchi. Another option was the Burrata (burrata cheese with winter squash, pomegranate and aged balsamic) -- if I had the chance again, I would hands down go with this one. I don't like too much cheese (I swear I am not too picky of an eater), but I do love mozzarella and I do love squash, so I was bummed out that I didn't order this.For the entree, I ordered the Cod, which came with leeks, savo cabbage and jersalem artichokes. I didn't really like this one - the cod was too buttery for me, and I drank lots of water to somewhat balance it out, which resulted in me being too full to eat anything else. So sad about this dish, also. My friends ordered the Hot Smoked Salmon (salmon with heirloom grains, beets and horseradish crème fraîche) and the Braised Lamb Shoulder (lamb with niçoise olives, swiss chard and lemon confit) -- both were delicious, so I was super jealous.For the dessert, I went with the Opera cake, which came with a scoop of coffee ice cream  - so decadent! Except due to my water intake, I could not finish.For the cocktail (not included in RW), I ordered the Charles Dickens (Boodle's London Dry, Dolin Dry Vermouth, Rosemary, Apple Cider, Lemon). This was a great drink! My friend ordered the Negroni Sbagliato (Campari, Carpano Antica Vermouth, Prosecco). And of course, hers was better. But their cocktail menu is the bomb, especially if you love literature! All of the cocktails are named after famous authors. That's the whole theme of the restaurant, by the way: vintage library.If I could redo this meal, I would, trust me.But I loved the service and the ambiance. It's a little too bougey for me, so I honestly don't know when I'd come here again, but it's good to know that this fanciness exists in this drab area. However, I do want to go down the cocktail list of authors - they all sound so good!Cailin's Recommendations- Burrata ($19)- Ricotta Gnudi ($18)- Hot Smoked Salmon ($37)- Braised Lamb Shoulder ($45)",3,1,2,Cailin C.,"Elmhurst, NY",23,87,106

5.0,2/5/2018,"I had initially been to Temple Court when it was known as Fowler and Wells; in fact, it was shortly after Chef Tom Colicchio actually opened the space.  Located within the historic Beekman Hotel, Temple Court offered a sprawling, elegant bar and lounge that exuded class and sophistication.  There was also a quieter main dining room with stained glass windows and high ceilings, feeling reminiscent of its temple namesake.  I recall that my first visit had included spectacular service and phenomenal food.  My friend and I had started with Roasted Jerusalem Artichokes, which were accompanied by leeks, salsify and a truffle vinaigrette.  We had loved this dish, so I was thrilled to see it still on the menu on my second, recent outing.  I also remember enjoying the ceviche-like Hamachi with sea urchin and matsutake; the Black Bass with oven-roasted tomatoes, piperade, and beluga lentils; and the Apple Tarte Tatin with pumpkin seeds and ice cream.  After such a stellar experience, I was ecstatic when I discovered that the restaurant was participating in the Winter 2018 Restaurant Week and decided to introduce my brother to this beautiful destination.  Both dining areas were packed, likely with other diners trying to benefit from the special prix-fixe and reduced pricing.  Though the cocktails all sounded appealing, we decided it would be more cost-effective to share a bottle of wine.  We had asked the sommelier for some descriptions and decided on the 2016 Krettnacher Euchariusberg, Falkenstein Riesling Kabinett from Mosel.  While we knew that it would be on the sweeter side, it was a bit too much for our varied, savory meal.  We wound up turning down the bottle and switching to the 2016 F. Cazin Cheverny Rose from the Loire Valley.  This wine had a balance of cream and strawberry flavors, with a slight acidity.  We really enjoyed it and found it more versatile than our previous selection.  Aside from the generous and informative sommelier, the rest of the service was a bit spotty, as we had to often ask for things, such as water refills or their warm, whole wheat sourdough rolls with their crisp crust.  For our first tasting course, we both selected the Burrata, which was surrounded by crescent moons of winter squash and magenta pomegranate seeds.  The cheese was impeccable with its thin, tougher outer layer and gooey interior.  The squash and fruit were excellent seasonal accompaniments.   A balsamic glaze added an acidic element to the plate.  I then had went with the Cod for my entrée.  The perfectly prepared filet had an ideal amount of salt on its crisped top.  It was served over sautéed leeks, savoy cabbage, and Jerusalem artichokes.  My brother's Braised Lamb Shoulder was lean and tender.  It was served with niçoise olives, Swiss chard, and a lemon confit, leaving the dish a bit too salty and briny tasting.  Therefore, the cod was the clear winner of that course.  Our desserts were both decent, but nothing spectacular.  My Opera Torte included a cake with layers of dry white  sponge and coffee mousse, as well as a rich chocolate top coating.  It was served with a scoop of silky coffee whipped cream, which possessed a ton of flavor.  My brother's Baked Alaska was more impressive looks-wise; the round chocolate cake was also dry, but covered with a torched prong meringue with pecans inside.  It was very striking, but the cake left a bit to be desired.My recent trip to Temple Court was fully of high points, though I remember the initial visit to have impressed me much more.  However, they did offer one of the better Restaurant Week experiences.",8,1,9,Alison C.,"Hoboken, NJ",1125,1410,640
2.0,2/4/2018,"I really wanted to love this restaurant, but the food disappointed.I loved the crispy roasted Brussels sprouts in the ricotta gnudi and the richly flavored lamb cavatelli.  Sadly, it all went downhill after the appetizers.  The skate, while perfectly pan fried, was inedibly salty and the rabbit coq au vin was dried to the point that it looked burnt.  I appreciated the fragrant duck confit, but like the rabbit, this dish was overpowered by salt.The deserts were far from delicate.  The banana tart suffered weakness in appearance, taste and texture.  It was a like supermarket pastry from Whole Foods.  The opera cake was tasty, if coarse.  To put it kindly, it's a different style of opera cake than Takahachi Bakery's.  Finally, the baked Alaska failed to impress.Service was gracious and the space is more beautiful than pictures could capture.  If only the food matched up to the chef's reputation.",1,0,1,Professional N.,"New York, NY",0,44,6

The soup was rich in flavor and perfect for the weather of that day. Next I had the halibut meunière with lemon, capers, spinach, and leeks. The fish was nice and flakey and with tons of flavor.

Every anniversary we go back and is very special. This year for our third anniversary I decided I wanted to try Tom's new baby, what a mistake! I made the reservation and specifically asked to be seated with a good server since it was such an special night for us -I explained everything to the person on the phone- Well, the unexpected happened. The waiter didn't know the menu, we felt super-mega rushed, he even brought the wrong dessert, when I asked him for what I really ordered, I had to wait over 20 minutes but my husband already had his dessert... double shifting if you ask me! There we didn't felt the rush!!!! Anyways, i asked for the check, told the guy to forget the dessert and ran out as soon as I possible could. TERRIBLE service!!!! I do not want to be rushed on my dinner anniversary where I spend $400!!!! I want my waiter to be more pleasant, have more knowledge and not to be rushed on such a special night for us!

2.0,9/30/2017,"The decor is beautiful and the food was flavorful with a nice presentation. I have nothing but compliments for the food But the service was far below what you might expect from this highly priced restaurant. Our waiter was very pushy about the tasting menu, which we repeatedly declined because it required everyone at the table to order it. Our first appetizer was an oyster with heavy cream sauce and bread crumbs. It was fresh and briny, which would have been a good reason to change our cutlery before our second appetizer, a ravioli dish which we shared.  The dish was consumed and cleared---good, despite the unwanted brine from using the same utensils.Then another server showed up with the small plates which were meant for the dish already removed. We had resorted to using our bread plates before the food got cold. The employee wielding the crumb brush did only half the table, wiping crumbs onto the floor. In other restaurants I've seen this act performed quickly and efficiently but this was clumsy and inattentive. One of the hallmarks of good service is never having an empty water glass---someone should tell this to the bus staff here.   One person in our party ordered a St Germain on ice with soda splash.  When the bill came we'd been charged $30 for it. Waiter said it was ""2 shots"". I can buy a large bottle of St Germain for that price. Really felt that was an inappropriately exorbitant charge. Four of us shared the baked Alaska, again without small plates so everyone was reaching in and trailing drips across the tablecloth, acceptable at Denny's but not where you are spending $100+ per person. It may seem I am nit-picking but attention to detail matters during a fine dining experience. And our dining experience did not seem to matter to the staff at Temple Court.",0,0,0,Deborah A.,"Bradenton, FL",0,1,0

I am very happy that I decided in the end to give it a shot!When I made the reservation I noted that this would be a business lunch and that we hoped for a relatively quick service (1.5 hours). The hostess and waiter were very attentive and accommodating. The food was also better than I had expected, but it was not spectacular. The complementary bread was fantastic - hot, crusty little baguettes that we could have all eaten more of. We started with the burrata with pluots and the fluke carpaccio to share. The burrata was good (it's hard to go wrong with burrata), but it was overpowered by the very sweet and syrupy pluots, which took up about as much of the plate as the burrata. We also had to ask for more bread, as they didn't bring any with the burrata, and sadly the bread they brought was not (and was not nearly as remarkable as) the baguettes. The fluke was meh. The melon that accompanied it was nice, but the fluke just fell flat. There was no salt or oil or heat to bring out any of its flavor.I had the branzino as my main and really enjoyed it. While it was a little heavier than I would have liked, it was nicely cooked and the summer vegetable accompaniment provided a refreshing contrast. My colleagues also ordered fish, the skate and tuna nicoise, and both finished their plates and seemed to enjoy them.All in all a very nice meal in a beautiful setting and with attentive service. The dishes were nothing extraordinary, but they were enjoyable.

When I told the manager it was rude he said people are in a hurry. Huh? Later when I mentioned the $10 surcharge for steak on the restaurant week lunch was not listed on the online menu (though it is on the menu at the restaurant) he stared blankly. Also told me I was taking the check thing too personally! And then said they have a one hour turnaround time for Restaurant Week. There was nobody waiting to be seated. And we were not lingering -- we had just received our dessert. As for the food, it was uneven. The peach salad was divine.

We were given complimentary sparkling water and bread. The whipped butter tasted good! I'm not a bread person but gaugibg from the parentals, this was good butter since they asked for more bread! The restaurant week menu had a good selection of appetizers and entrees. We asked a few questions re: what's in this dish, what's that,etc and our girl was able to answer each question confidently. She's also obviously tried most of this stuff so was able to give her two cents on it as well. I love that! We started with the fluke crude, the bigaly (pasta) with clams and the corn chowder with bacon and tarragon. All apps were good size and tasty. For mains, we had the steak au poivre, the steamed branzino, and the duck confit. The steak au poivre was decent sized with a $10 supplement. Dad liked the taste. Mom's branzino was good and served on a bed of quinoa. My aunt and I had the duck confit. It was so tender. I wonder if they used a sous vide to make this this. Off the bone!! Duck was served over faro. Great combo. For dessert, we had the frozen souffle which was light yet tasty. The tarte tartin was nice as well. The parentals decided to go for macarons to go.

Me and my boyfriend shared two appetizers, two main courses, and two desserts - and had two glasses of wine from North Fork. All amazing. First of all the location. We picked it because I wanted to check this out really badly. The Beekman Hotel was recently restored and its a NYC landmark. The restaurant decor and atmosphere is magic, and you fell back in 1930s. The atrium with the bar is below the building famous beaux-art courtyard. Service was impeccable. Classy, polite, and fast.

Most other guests were having either a late brunch or an afternoon pick-me-up. I can't speak to the alcoholic beverages (yet) but there's a strong tea and coffee selection. Service is top notch, but also not that surprising given the prices charged and the slow time of day.

I co-own fashion public relations and in my 20 years of business in manhattan I have never been to a restaurant that acted this way.  I will never bring a client there or suggest that anyone goes.  No one apologized, there were no other people in the restaurant so if they function like this with 1 table I can only imagine how they are with a full client night.  The building itself is beautiful but my 48th birthday dinner was not!",1,2,0,Mauricio P.,"Manhattan, NY",262,30,0

Finally, for dessert we ordered Baked Alaskan...(as a side note we were never offered coffee or tea just another example of the bad service) I don't know what that was we got but it wasn't a Baked Alaskan...beyond disappointing.  With so many amazing options in NYC I'd visit the bar for a pre-dinner drink then go elsewhere for a better meal.",0,0,0,Janet S.,"Bridgewater, NJ",96,83,19

The amuse bouche was a pana cotta that was pretty good, but nothing special.I shared the foie gras as an appetizer with my boyfriend, and this was delicious and a large portion.  The pickled strawberries and the pistachios went together so well and the creamy texture of the foie gras was perfect.  They also split up the appetizers into 2 for sharing purposes, which I always like when restaurants do.I ordered the bass for my main course, and it was too fishy for me with all of the other seafood items in there.  The skin wasn't crispy either and I just wasn't the biggest fan.My boyfriend ordered the veal though and he really enjoyed that.Others at the table ordered the egg/asparagus starter (so over priced for what it is), the Monkfish and the Scallops, and all enjoyed those items as well.We were unfortunately too full for dessert, but will try something next time.I think if they work on training their servers then this place will be great.",6,3,5,Elyka A.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",198,204,634

I tasted the other entrees on the table, looked great, very tough and chewy lamb and sirloin. The sommelier and server were great, poised and professional. However when I sent my scallops back, the server asked me how much salt I wanted. Really, you want me to come back there and salt my own scallops?

3.0,3/22/2017,"Proof that it takes a village...I thought it was lucky that Tom Colicchio's new restaurant happens to be inside the first hotel (first of 3) that I was to be staying at during my recent trip to NYC.I also considered it lucky that I managed to snag a reservation for my arrival night, which was a Saturday night.  The reservation was for 10:30, which is a late dinner even by NYC standards.  But when you're flying in from SFO (read: total opposite end of the country), & your flight doesn't arrive until 7:00, & you're landing in Newark, 10:30 is actually perfect.  Time to settle into your room, dress for dinner, & have a glass of wine at The Bar Room while waiting for your table.  And that's exactly what I did.Things were pretty golden at the start.  We were seated at the best table in the house, the front corner booth at the window.  The only downside to this was that since it was still winter, & thus freezing, being right by the windows was chilly.  It was 19 degrees out.  Everyone at the neighboring tables kept their jackets & coats on.  Eating dinner in my camel coat might be very Holly Golightly of me, but it's not exactly comfortable.  I'm not sitting in my car, for chrisakes.  Halfway through the meal, I was able to take it off.  But, better insulation?  Storm windows?  Please?Of course, the colder it is, the more wine they sell.Now...dinner.  It seems that our actual server either was too busy at 10:30 w other tables, or was just too tired to take the last table of the night.  Because it really felt like our ""server"" was really a busboy that stood in to take our order.  Fail.  If you book a table for 10:30, or midnight, or 1AM, that table should get the same level of service that the first table of the night received.  Always.And I certainly hope this was not the level of service that the first table of the night received.He was nice enough.  But not speaking English clearly, & his being very green, both made for a clumsy & lackluster dining experience.  Not what you should expect from a Tom Colicchio establishment.Since we had already had the cheese plate at The Bar Room while waiting for our table, we only did entrees here.  The foie gras was as decadent & exquisite as I anticipated.  Straight up luxurious.  Velvety, & subtle, it was a treat for my tongue & my tastebuds.  There was surprisingly a lot more of it than I'm accustomed to, even for being an entree.  Foie gras is so rich, less is really more.  I know, champagne problems...too much foie gras!  A great dish.The lamb.  Oy.  Such beautiful cuts...if only they were cooked as requested.  I asked for medium.  What was brought to the table was indisputably rare.  Sigh.  This was my first meal in NYC since moving back to SF almost 10 years ago.  I wanted it to be perfect.  Yes, I could have sent it back.  But since I just flew in, I was already losing 4 hours (3 w the time change, & another one because it was daylight savings night).  Who wants to deal?  It's nearing midnight (so, 1 AM).  I'm ready for dessert.When I say dessert here, I mean only one thing.  The baked alaska.  All of a sudden, our bus boy/server is gone, & we're greeted by a sweet, extremely informed, & professional young lady.  I asked, & she happily gave us her dessert recommendations.  But all I wanted was that baked alaska.  Knowing that not every restaurant presents it the traditional way, by lighting it on fire, I asked her if that was the case here.""They don't trust us to do that at the table here.""I just flew 3000 miles.  I wanted fire.  Honestly, I was actually too full for dessert anyway.  But if there was fire, it would have been done.This young lady should have been our server.  She was absolutely great.I stayed at this hotel (The Beekman) for 4 nights.  Yet I dined here only once.  Even w the nor'easter that hit 3 days later, I opted to do dinner elsewhere.Respect for Mr. Colicchio, but his prolific career & name are not enough.  A well versed & professional staff at every stage, clear communication, & dishes that are properly executed to order still count for a lot.  It is a beautiful restaurant.  The foie gras was excellent.  And our tail end server was great.3 stars.",16,10,12,Veronica M.,"San Francisco, CA",1571,804,1743

The wait staff is extremely attentive and knowledgeable, though our waiter's recommendations didn't end up being our table's favorite dishes. The sommelier was very good and made fantastic recommendations for two wines. We also thoroughly enjoyed our cocktails. My meal - sweetbreads followed by the delectably crispy porcelet -  was delicious, one of the best I've had in NYC in a while. Others among my party were slightly less enthusiastic. Our waiter was gung-ho about the seafood dishes, but we found both the scallops and monkfish to be good but not memorable or unique. Similar reaction to the rabbit schnitzel. The one dish we didn't like was the hamachi appetizer. My banana tartin dessert was lovely, perfectly carmelized, and the baked Alaskan was also tasty and very pretty.

The host/seating situation was not smooth, they didn't seem to have adequate support at the check in desk. As we were being seated, there was a waitress on the floor under our table fixing a wobble so we stood there awkwardly until it was fixed. From there on out the service was clumsy, unsophisticated and unpolished from start to finish - I had to laugh at the end when the waitress dropped a knife and fork on my feet...It was like watching a farce. The food was substandard st best. The Jerusalem artichoke starter was a bland plate of mush with dried out, flavorless black truffle shavings. The entree of rabbit schnitzel was completely unappetizing. A deep fried slice of dry, flavorless meat that could have been chicken or fish from a fast food restaurant, served over a bed of what was said to be pistachios and chanterelles, though had I not read that on the menu I would not have identified them as such, it tasted like a plate of bland undercooked beans. I abandoned the dish after a few bites. Dessert was a mediocre frozen parfait with an indistinguishable flavor...the menu said it was grapes and olive oil. My mother fared better with a simple green salad to start, some scallops that were good but nothing out of the ordinary, and a dessert of Millefeuille with lemon creme that was sweet and basic. The best part of the meal was the bottle of Alsatian wine we ordered. The $250 bill was a smack after a meal that couldn't begin to compare to the food at so many of my favorite NY spots that cost far less. Go to the Beekman for a cocktail under the stunning Lobby atrium, perhaps have a steak frites at Augustine, but do yourself a favor and bypass F&W.....they might easily attract hotel guests from out of town, but it would be a shame to waste a meal here given a sea of better options.

Our online reservation came through without a hitch, and we were seated promptly upon arrival.The food is also amazing. I like that the food isn't too pretentious - it has plenty of innards (which I like) and evokes the feeling of what I imagine eating fancy food in the 50s or 60s is like, only modernized.Case in point: the sweetbreads with loose brussel sprout leaves, bacon, and black trumpet mushrooms appetizer ($25). The sweetbreads were so tender and fatty, and then crisped up nicely on the outside. The entire dish was an umami and textural bomb - I enjoyed it a lot and would gladly order a double portion of this for my entree.For my main, I got the scallops with leeks, savoy cabbage, artichokes, and black truffle vinaigrette ($37). I love the savoy cabbage in this dish, it's flavorful and is tender and has fully absorbed whatever savory braising liquid it was cooked in - I feel like I'm eating something homey and heartwarming and hearty and it somehow made me feel nostalgic for a time that I didn't even belong to.Anyway, the food here gives me feelings and that's probably the best compliment I can give.

I ordered something else instead :) The salad with the pears and cheese, yum. I got the scallops as my main meal. They were good, and I'd recommend them, but it's really the baked alaska that made me want to write this review. My main gripe is that they made us wait by the bar for our table (for like 45 min) even though there were clearly tables available... trying to make the place feel and appear even more popular than it already actually was I guess.",0,0,0,Caitlin B.,"New York, NY",3,280,35

1.0,1/27/2017,"I was extremely excited to go since it was Tim Collichio (Top Chef Judge)'s restaurant.  I booked via Opentable for a weekday 11am slot, and when I arrived the hostess was nowhere to be found.  When I finally located her, she said we can take a seat anywhere in the bar area since it was somewhat empty.  We were seated and handed the bar menu, and when I asked if they have a lunch menu she said ""We don't do lunch today"".  I was shocked that they would open up slots to reserve on Opentable if they don't serve lunch, and second of all she never mentioned the kitchen closes from 11am to 12pm, she just said ""We don't do lunch today""!!! I asked the Hotel Concierge to help us book Augustine instead and he assured me that lunch should be open from 12pm.  When I returned to my seat, the manager told me that they do actually do lunch from 12pm.... So we waited for an hour at the bar area.  The bar area staff (Tall dirty blond hair guy, looked fairly young) was very stuck up which made the situation worse.  He finally came to take our order finally and then spilled tea on table, without apologizing or wiping it.... Also not sure why it took him so long to bring wine out.  It took forever when the bar was clearly not busy. We ended up sitting down in dining room at 12pm, we asked for the waitress to bring our drinks from the bar table that we sat at, 30min later still no drinks.  We had to ask another staff to help us.  The food was OK, in my opinion too much sodium.  For a $32 lobster salad, it barely had lobster actually in it.  Overall super disappointing.  There are so many restaurants where you can get this quality of food and also awesome service.  I wouldn't recommend your $$$ for this place.",1,0,0,FoodieInFiDi K.,"Port Chester, NY",110,7,5

3.0,1/20/2017,"I would love to say I enjoyed dinner here but it's more of a fancy sounding menu without the substance to match.  APPETIZERS1) HAMACHI WITH SEA URCHIN AND MATSUTAKEMainly hamachi with a dab of sea urchin. Tasting and savoring as much as I could but I couldn't understand what flavor I was supposed to enjoy, what was it trying to evoke. Not to get too deep but this did nothing for my taste buds but confuse them because it was quite bland2) SAUTÉED FOIE GRAS WITH PERSIMMON, CIPOLLINI ONIONS, PINK PEPPERCORNS AND BITTER GREENSAnother disappointment- normally I enjoy fois grois but this one, perhaps because it was sautéed, seemed simply put, weird ENTREES1) HOT SMOKED MONKFISH WITH BEETS, HEIRLOOM GRAINS, OSETRA CAVIAR AND HORSERADISH CRÈME FRAÎCHE2) NIMAN RANCH SIRLOIN WITH BRAISED SHORT RIB, DELICATA SQUASH, ABALONE MUSHROOMS AND MADEIRABoth dishes were OK with the monkfish being the better of the two.

Nothing spectacular with baked Alaska or frozen parfait. Strange dinner experience indeed. I certainly hope my impression was not affected by the snooty service received by the hosts/hostesses at the front. Upon walking in, greeted the doorman who was polite and pleasant, but just checking in and trying to get my coat checked was difficult. I'm standing right in front of you and talking/responding to you. The least you could do is pay attention and provide customer service. Waiter was a notch better but seemed distant when we opted out of the tasting menu. Plus after one of the managers helped clear the table, provided the bill and had payment processed, I'm preparing my things and the waiter comes to me saying he'll bring the check. It's one of my pet peeves when people don't pay attention. It just wasn't a good night",6,1,1,Rose I.,"Manhattan, NY",105,441,3759

4.0,1/12/2017,"KenScale: 8.0/10Tom Colicchio is one of the most well-known celebrity chefs in the media, having served as the head judge on the popular Top Chef shows. I'm always somewhat ambivalent about these breeds of chefs who have spent more time on the TV screen than at the kitchen. Is their cooking as good in practice as people think? At least when I visited the chef's now shuttered restaurant in Chelsea, Colicchio & Sons, several years ago, I was very underwhelmed to say the least. Therefore, when chef Colicchio decided to open a new project at the Beekman Hotel that is five minutes from where I live, I was torn whether I should check out this place. It looked like a classic expense account-type place that you go in more for the crowd and vibe (the bar room outside the restaurant is constantly packed with handsome locals and tourists alike every time my girlfriend and I head over for quick drinks) than the quality of food. When we had a guest from out of town and it was too cold to venture outside, I figured now might as well be the time to try Fowler & Wells. It was a solid meal; somewhat lacking in imagination, but overall I thought the level of execution was on consistently above-average level.The menu at Fowler & Wells won't wow you with funny sounding dishes that jump at you. When he opened the restaurant. chef Colicchio himself has emphasized that he wants to have a classic American restaurant with more focus to the quality of food than experimenting with different ingredients or techniques. Still, there were some delicious dishes. Chestnut agnolotti with celery root and black truffles, which the server recommended as the most popular appetizer in the menu, had nice balance of flavor without overpowering creaminess, and sweetbreads with Brussels sprouts, bacon and black trumpets were also serviceable, although I couldn't find anything that was memorable about Hamachi with sea urchin and matsutake (where is the taste of sea urchin or mushroom?). Instead of the entrée options on the a la carte menu, we selected two dishes from the tasting menu (offered at $135 per person, and frankly at Fowler & Wells, going a la carte seems like a smarter idea than doing the tasting menu). Lobster ""thermidor"" with chanterelles and tarragon was expertly cooked and I liked the way the ingredients came together in a delicious way. Instead of the traditional beef Wellington, the restaurant served one with venison, and the combination of the meat with chestnuts, black trumpet mushrooms and huckleberries in the surroundings gave a surprisingly rustic touch that I enjoyed quite a lot. For desserts, I slightly preferred the baked Alaska with chocolate and pecans that gave nutty flavor to the millefeuille with lemon that I couldn't think anything special about after the meal.   Getting a reservation at the dining room of Fowler & Wells seems a lot easier than securing a space at the bar room outside, where you're often quoted up to an hour-long wait at peak times. The dining room has a classic American vibe that fit well with the overall décor of the Beekman Hotel. There is full menu with extensive wine selections (many from France) you can select from to complement your meal. Will I sprint back to Fowler & Wells anytime soon? I doubt it, but I would like to see how the menu evolves over time, as there are some distinctly classic American dishes that I think has potentials to get even better should chef Colicchio pay more attention to his new project.",8,2,0,Ken S.,"Manhattan, NY",512,612,4738
4.0,1/11/2017,"Fantastic meal with one major flaw - ordered the Jerusalem artichoke appetizer that had shaved black truffles on it and the truffles were entirely tasteless and ordorless (had the texture of a stale cracker). A sign of a truffle gone bad? A faux Chinese truffle? What could be the reason? I have had my fair share of both white and black truffles in some of the finest restaurants around France and Italy and never experienced this problem. I had to ask my waiter what I was eating and when he told me ""fresh truffle"" I felt dumbfounded. Tasteless AND ordorless truffles, the worlds most alluring ingredient now has no flavor?

Staff is friendly and helpful at recommending drinks to pair with our dishes.We ordered hamachi with sea urchin, roasted Jerusalem artichokes, black bass, and baked Alaska. Everything was excellent. The sauce in hamachi and sea urchin is slightly sour and nutty which matches the fat hamachi and nutty sea urchin perfectly well. Black bass: one of my freshest and most delicious seafood dish of the year. Highly recommend. Jerusalem artichokes: (the root of artichokes, very starchy like potatoes) the artichokes are nicely baked and flavored--slightly fruity sweet taste, yet has more details as you chew along. A hint of fiber-ish texture and veggie/fruity ish flavor. Excellent sauce.Baked Alaska: surprise ice cream hidden inside! Yummy as how pretty it is!Highly recommend.

Drink order screwed up twice. Just wanted the IPA. First they forgot. Second wrong beer. 10 mins later the right beer. Apps and dinner served appropriately. But the plates don't get cleared for like 15 minutes. To the point that after getting seated 15 minutes late + 15 minute plate delay, we just weren't interested in dessert.

I also called an hour before the reservation and they asked again the names. Fast forward to dessert and no names were inscribed in chocolate or anywhere else. Wouldn't have been a big deal if it wasn't brought up twice.  But, the kicker was when we asked about it, the waiter said it was for only marketing purposes. WTF?! Is someone really keeping track of someone's first names for a dessert candle or inscription we never got. We brought this up to the manager also who apologized properly. Another faux pa was when the entrees were brought out after 20 min and then 3 apps were totally neglected! When asked about them, the waiter said I never ordered them. When I reminded him, he said oh yeah sorry. We got free dessert, but to be honest, the bass, monkfish nor rabbit were not memorable. The desserts, too, were blah and bland.

4.0,12/17/2016,"I'm rating this a 4-stars based on the overall experience and 3-stars for the food.I hosted a private dinner for a family member recently and decided on this restaurant.  It is inside one of the most beautiful and trendy hotels right now in NYC...The Beekman.  That internal atrium is just gorgeous....it was built in the late 1800s to house legal offices and had fallen into disrepair recently.  After the renovations, I am intrigued by the rooms so will try to stay there next time I visit.In booking with the Event staff, I had a great experience.  Ali was helpful and tried to accommodate where she could...the menus are very limited for special events and not exactly the same as what is served in the restaurant.  However, she checked with the pastry chef when I asked for a substitution of the desserts which I appreciated.The service on the night of the event was 5-stars.  Micaela was our event manager for the evening and she really worked hard with the staff that night to make it a memorable evening.  She was so helpful that our group loved her.  We also had an open bar setup - the bartender for the evening was great as well.  There were only two things to note for those organizing an event here:  remind the wait staff (and guests!) to refill drinks since it's open bar and have the restaurant make sure that the food stays warm.  Part of this was our fault because we didn't make it easy for them to pace the courses since we were in the middle of activities.Food was good.  I really enjoyed the carpaccio of fluke which is served raw like sashimi.  The beef entree was a shade overcooked for me and not warm.  We were too busy playing a game during dessert so I only had bites of the concord grape sorbet which was very good.  The Chapel room was nice for a small party.  It can be stark without additional decor such as flower arrangements and candles...the votives provided by the restaurant were not enough to warm up the table. The only other thing to note is that the restrooms are in the basement which none of us minded.

We were seated quickly and were asked about drinks. We all wanted cocktails, which seem strange to our waitstaff. They apparently milled around a bit and we waited to order. And waited. They came to ask about food orders and we told them we were still waiting for the cocktail orders. I say ""they"" because at least three different people came to ask us about our orders (or lack thereof). Finally out drink orders were taken and again the waitstaff started asking about food. We had to keep pushing them away as we hadn't even gotten our cocktails yet.  Blah blah blah and finally the cocktails came (quite nice) and we proceeded to order food and wine. One person in our party is allergic to tree nuts - they staff were VERY accommodating with that and provided helpful advice on what to order and what dishes could or couldn't be modified. The food came. Oh my. I had the sweetbreads - which were lovely, but the sauce was TOO SALTY. I followed with the rabbit schnitzel which was wonderful, but the accompaniments were TOO SALTY.  I mean really salty.  Several colleague ordered the steak which came fairly unadorned and did not have the salt problem.  Also the foie gras and the hamachi seemed fine. Best advice is to get things with less sauce or ask them to alter the seasoning. In the end the service settled down and was appropriately attentive. It is quite friendly and helpful when paced correctly. For a place trying to be high end, the portions are pretty large. I might try this again-not sure.

We weren't crazy about the blue cheese dish as it was a bit overwhelming and felt unbalanced.

Again, venison Wellington was the highlight. Order it if you can, you won't regret it. On a final note, the atmosphere was wonderful and the service was top notch.

It's served with Brussels sprouts, bacon and mushrooms. Really great mix of sweet, salty and savory flavors. We also had the agnolotti, which was good.We had the rabbit schnitzel and the bass, both of which were well balanced and delicious. The real stand out of the mains for me was the beef cheeks, however. It was a very large portion, well cooked and the sauce was to die for. The potatoes that it came with were scalloped, light, and perfect! The only downside was the dessert. The Pannacotta was a little thin, and the other thing which sounded interesting (had olives on it) was actually a little bland and not memorable.
