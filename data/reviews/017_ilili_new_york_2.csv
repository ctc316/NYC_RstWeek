3.0,4/28/2019,"I have mixed feelings about this place. I'll start with the good.The Good: The food is delicious and the atmosphere is great. My wife and I came here to take our cousin out who will be graduating from college soon. The ambiance is great for conversation and it's upscale enough without feeling pretentious. Both the lounge area and the dining area are nice. For a cocktail, I had the Not So Bloody Martini, which was excellent (I had two). It tasted like a bloody mary but it was a vodka cocktail. One of the best cocktails I've had in the City. The meats (Mixed Grill) were cooked perfectly and sides tasted great (cauliflower, brussel sprouts, hummus, burrata, duck schwarma). Desserts were very good as well (molten cake, strawberry & chocolate). Overall very pleased with the quality of the actual meal and drinks. From a timing and friendliness standpoint, the service was great as well. Our waiter was friendly, came around at the right times and the right number of times. He wasn't over-bearing but was also attentive enough to address everything we wanted. The Bad: There's some sneaky up-charging that went on with our order. For instance, when I ordered the Not So Bloody Mary, he asked if Grey Goose was OK. Sure. I didn't think too much of it. I'd figure a $17 cocktail came with premium liquor, which is the norm around NYC, at least in my experience. Turns out, it's a $3 additional charge, so it was an additional $6 charge on two of them. On the duck schwarma, I asked how many came with the order. He said 2 but they're big, but he can make it into 4 smaller ones since there's 3 of us. Sounds good. Again, another $3 upcharge without telling us. So there were $9 in total upcharges without him mentioning to us. On a $300 tab it's nothing, and $9 bucks is not a lot, but I find it extremely annoying when restaurants do this. Be a good waiter and mention the upcharge. I would've paid the upcharge on the schwarma but not the cocktail. Again, the amount wasn't an issue, it's the principle. I'd give this place 4 stars if it wasn't for this issue. Also, I think generally the food is a little overpriced for what it is. It is very good, but in my opinion, it's priced ~15-20% higher than what it's actually worth in the market. I'm not mad about this, just my opinion. I'd come here again if we had guests to entertain for dinner (atmosphere is great for this, would be aware of the upcharging issue), but would not come for a dinner date with the wife.",0,0,0,Daniel S.,"Manhattan, NY",297,9,0

2.0,4/19/2019,"My wife, 21 year old daughter and I had dinner at ilili tonight. Bill was $205. The tough part was that we cared more about the meal than the server and chef combined. Server immediately tried the upsell on extra salads and higher end alcohol. Didn't see him much after that. ""How is your meal sir? Anything I can bring you?"".  Didn't happen. Not once. Hummus was great, Brussels sprouts were amazing. Duck & chicken Schwarma was so dry it was inedible. Had to ask for a yogurt sauce to choke it down. Then got charged an extra $2 for the yogurt. Octopus was perfectly cooked, but accompaniments were very dry also. A little olive oil drizzle maybe?  Chef obviously hasn't tasted the food being served in a while. Very disappointing.",0,0,0,Mark K.,"New York, NY",0,4,0
1.0,4/16/2019,"I'm re-posting this older review as my first one was deleted.  We came here for Restaurant Week (yes, I know, we are inferior citizens), so we expected the portion sizes to be smaller, there to be a limited menu, etc.  However, after we were seated and ordered drinks, we were informed that most of the Restaurant Week menu items were not available, which was surprising given that we were there during a normal dinner time (not super late at night).  The only remaining entrees were all vegetarian.  The waiter tried to be helpful but when we asked if there could be a substitution, he got his manager who not only refused to offer up a non-vegetarian option, but was incredibly rude and even told us we should just leave and go elsewhere.  If you don't like Restaurant Week customers, then don't bother participating.  I would have returned as a non-Restaurant Week customer if I liked the place, but have no interest in giving money to a place to be treated rudely.",0,0,0,JF S.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,5,0

Started with a Fresh Meadow drink - delicious, amazingly clean tasting drink.

1.0,4/7/2019,"Don't come here unless you want food poisoning and managers who don't care.In a call, I was told to leave a message for the manager given they were out for a meeting. They never got back to me. I had to call yet again a few days later for which they were unaware of the situation. I had to wait for another call from their team who said they'll conduct investigations internally and get back to me within 48 hours. They did not get back to me. They don't care.My trip to New York was ruined by being bedridden for 3 days due to unsanitary food. Given the high ratings on Yelp and the price point of the restaurant, I expected better. Even food trucks don't give me food poisoning, yet an established restaurant does.Both my friend and I ended up getting food poisoning from this restaurant - and you know it's from here given this was the only meal we both had.

5.0,3/31/2019,"We had a great brunch at this restaurant. First, the place is beautiful. Second, the staff was super friendly. Our waiter was helpful and gave us the best tips. We decided to try the brunch deal, which is a bargain when comparing to other dishes' prices (USD 31 for coffee + cava cocktail + brunch entree + one side). Their pita bread is perfect. My overall experience was from 4.5 to 5. Here the dishes I tried:The truffle eggs benedict (5 stars): The eggs were perfectly cooked, truffle flavor was on point and the bread well done. Arugula was little bit over salted, but I enjoy this way.Side 1 - the veal bacon (5 stars): I was not sure about trying a veal bacon, because pork bacon is amazing. However, it was a big surprise. The veal bacon was so juicy and had an amazing flavor. I can have this for breakfast everyday. Side 2 - makenek lamb sausage (4.5 stars): It's a lamb sausage with pine nuts. It is a strong flavor and can take over someone's entrée. It was well seasoned though. I will come back for brunch. Maybe I would try dinner sometime.",0,0,1,Eduardo C.,"Washington, DC",261,52,163
5.0,3/28/2019,"3 beautiful rooms--a bar room, a main dining room and a room that simulates a large tent with canvas like shades over the windows--all quite elegant. The food is as good as it gets for Middle Eastern dishes, whether it be the Hummus, the square falafel balls, the Baba Ganoush or any of the very unusual cold and hot appetizers. Quite a varied selection, all amazing. Try the duck schwarma or the black iron shrimp.The main courses are all beautifully presented on the plate, and not overloaded/thrown on the plate like so many Mediterranean and Middle Eastern restaurants. Try the mixed grill, lamb chops, kafta or chicken taouk, each dish with just the right amount of food and plating design.

3.0,3/27/2019,"I give this place 3 stars for the ambiance, atmosphere, and cleanliness. The food disappointed me a bit and the service wasn't horrible but it wasn't the best either. When we walked in we were seated right away because it was lunch time and the place was actually pretty packed. We decided to try the grape leaves, the octopus, hummus, babagounush, some circle shaped meat that were stuffed with rice, chicken liver, some sausages, and the desert. I didn't mind the grape leaves but I didn't really like the mint flavor or whatever it was the green sauce coming out of it on the side. I still ate it though. The sausage was okay but it definitely had a spice in it that my palate wasn't accustomed too. The octopus was really fresh and delicious. The hummus plates were mediocre too me. I did like the pita bread they gave us for dipping. I didn't like the circular meatball thing ( I'm sorry I'm not sure if the name it's just that the spices inside were off). Last but not least the chicken liver was disgusting. I couldn't even bite into it. My boss said it tasted like dried up vinegar. I just don't understand the prices of this place either. It was over priced for sure ! I don't think I'll ever go back unless it's to the bar for a drink. My Don Julio margarita was great ! And the blueberry desert with cucumber was so weird but I didn't hate it !!!! I liked the wafer cookies on the side and the blueberry ice cream.",2,1,1,Jessica P.,"New York, NY",380,126,237
1.0,3/23/2019,"The positive reviews for this venue are beyond comprehension. Service reeks of pretentiousness and exudes an overtly unwelcoming vibe for those who they deem to be different from the rest of their visitors. Unaccepting of diversity, bottom line. Highly ironic that a restaurant located in Manhattan, a place that celebrates and embraces all cultures would spew such condescending vibes. Period. Went for a group dinner with friends with HIGH expectations after reading these reviews, which I feel were clearly written by people who have yet to dine at ACTUALLY amazing, trendy and memorable places throughout the city. What a shame. I put a lot of time into deciding on this venue and felt it was a must-visit restaurant given its lovely decor, round table arrangements and central location in Manhattan. Never was I so categorically wrong about a place in my life. FOOD: Extremely average (!!), and simply decent for the $$$ prices. The menu was clearly well thought-out and had a full range of options but the pita bread served for the table was probably the only memorable item at the table. SERVICE: Service was dismissive and subpar with all of the plates just added to the table at once with no indication of what was which and for whom. Because we don't often have Mediterranean food, it would have been great if they at least told us what the dishes were as they arrived. VIBE: The crowd in the dining room was mostly lots of family/somewhat of a more mature crowd And QUITE homogenous so our group probably stood out against the rest. Moreover, the staff was not the friendliest as I did notice quite a few side glances and condescending stares from the waitstaff even though we were just trying to have a normal dinner. One lady I noticed consistently watched our table as if we were intruding on their space. Totally unwelcoming, blatantly judging in every way and unprofessional beyond words. Im glad most of my group didnt notice this during the meal as I would have been utterly embarrassed for picking such a restaurant for our evening. Without question, ultimately the restaurant is apt for a polite dinner with parents, work colleagues/clientele but even so, the food is truly unremarkable, service unwelcoming. With tons of options in the nyc dining scene, one should never have to compromise by settling for what, from my experience has been a wildly overrated venue. Im glad I checked this experience off my wish list but safe to say, there's NO reason to go back or recommend it to others. The one plus was that the round table format for large groups.I seldom leave unpleasant reviews but felt this was absolutely justified. I doubt this one bad review particularly aimed at their unwelcoming service and condescending glances will change any attitudes or management style there. Im writing this to give potential customers a heads up on what they are walking into should they ever be FORCED to dine at this place. ***Honestly, even one star is one star too much for this establishment*** So yeah, if you'd love to dish out $$$$ for bland food, as you're being judged/watched from all directions from the waitstaff feel free to make a RSVP on Opentable! :)",7,1,5,Sunny C.,"New York, NY",103,169,106

1.0,3/19/2019,"Absolutely horrible place, never going again. We had a group for a birthday party and chose a bottle of wine at the beginning of the night. Every time someone would drink a sip, the servers would come and top us off. No one saw the bottom of their glass that evening and had no way of tracking how many glasses they drank. At the end of the night, they charged us for 14 bottles of wine when the servers NEVER told us when we finished our bottle and NEVER opened up a new bottle in front of us so we had no way to keep track. Normally, you get topped off when it's from the same bottle that has been opened. And when you finish that bottle the server TELLS YOU. We had 10 people drinking and no one was drunk - there was absolutely no way each person had a bottle of wine and more for themselves. When we asked to see corks they didn't show us. They served us like we were part of some all you can drink unlimited brunch and yet charged us for all of it without any communication in between bottles. Complete cheap, third world scam. Food isn't good enough to justify ever going again. My family is in the restaurant business and I'm absolutely sure this place is getting away with scamming people.

5.0,3/18/2019,"I love the food here! The bar prix fixe menu is a super affordable deal because you get 3 mezza in addition to a main, side, and dessert of your choice. Make sure you request the bar prix fixe menu before you sit because they'll seat you in the bar/lounge area instead of the main room. For this reason, I would recommend coming here with less than 3 other people if you're planning to get the bar prix fixe.The dishes are unique and well put together. I really enjoyed the vegetables in the mezza, especially the turnips, as all the ingredients were very fresh and had a lot of flavor. I chose the salmon for my main, which was cooked perfectly so that it was very crisp on top and soft inside. I had the rice as my side, which went well with the mezza, since I needed something to balance the sharp flavor. For the dessert, I had the halewe parfait, which was delicious as well. Although each dish is individually small in portion, together they form a filling meal.The service was extremely accommodating and the decor was lovely.

2.0,3/9/2019,"Highly disappointed when I first entered the restaurant. I've been here before so I had high expectations. We entered the restaurant only to be ""greeted"" by a hostess who happened to be working out someone else's table on her earpiece, starting with ""give me a second"" and a finger gesture, until she finally decided to look up and ask for our reservation. We were then passed onto another hostess to take us to our table... she had her sweater hanging off her shoulders, dragging her feet as if we were at the most casual spot, not about to pay 30$ for a dish. To be quite frank, I saw her around the entire night and it looked like she was walking around her house in her PJs just wanting to go to bed. She takes us upstairs where there are napkins on the FLOOR, the table beside us has food all over the tablecloth and used cutlery. By all means, do anything you can to NOT sit upstairs. It feels like an Applebee's. We then argued to be moved downstairs (there were several free tables downstairs the entire night) and a table just ""happened to have opened up"". From then on, the experience was great as our server Lubna was nothing short of excellent- she really made our night and she should be used as an example for all the servers and hostesses- she was truly hospitable and wonderful. I suggest Ilili ensure their staff is upto par for such an expensive restaurant as well as do a better job of not cramming people in the isolated upstairs area which has zero charm and ambience.",0,0,0,Divya P.,"Philadelphia, PA",0,5,0

4.0,3/4/2019,"Wow. This was the first place I have been to in a LONG time that I was seriously impressed by each dish. Most definitely my new favorite meal in NYC. My husband and I split 4 dishes and were totally full afterwards - mainly because of the hot fluffy pita they kept refreshing for us. We ordered: Mouhamara - I've had better homemade but this was still really goodWarak enab bil zeit - adorable mini size packed with flavor, the best grape leaves I've EVER hadKibbeh bi laban - amazingly deliciously yogurt sauce, but could have done without the butter in the center of each dumpling. After the first one it kind of grossed me out how much butter I was consuming - it also got into my hair because when you bite into it, the butter oozes out.Duck shwarma - the complete winner of the show - WOW this was amazing - one of those things you never want to end. I will come back a million times over for this dish! With all of this all being said - I hated the decor & vibe. It felt swanky, but kind of disheveled.

1.0,2/22/2019,"Well. Not impressed. Honestly, my group has never felt so insulted ever. In fact, it was actually pretty hilarious. First off I have to admit, the restaurant is gorgeous. At least downstairs. They have a beautiful dining room and a waiting area in which they force you to sit. We arrived relatively close to our reservation at about 6:30 PM. They put us in the holding area for about 20 minutes. It took us forever to even get a cocktail. When they were ready to take us to our table, imagine our surprise when, rather than sit in the downstairs beautiful dining area, they led us up a narrow stairs to an upstairs bar/dining room that was long, skinny and dark. They had hung sheets on the wall (classy!) and they proceeded to lead us to the farthest corner of the room. It was absolutely the worst table in the Entire restaurant. At that point, there was only our table and one other table in the room. The table was so tiny we were joking that when one of us breathed in, the other had to breathe out. We felt like honestly they didn't deem us attractive enough or young enough looking to merit to the downstairs restaurant which by the way at that point was pretty much empty. Mind you, we're not exactly schlumpy or dressed like we are homeless. In fact, Both of the men in our party are extremely successful and one is the chief of staff at a hospital in New York. Anyways, back to the dinner. The doctor is a very knowledgeable wine guy and frankly, the wines they had were relatively average. He ordered a decent relatively higher-end red and they brought us large wine glasses. . He also ordered a white and apparently, per the waitress because it was not Not quite as expensive we did not merit the nicer glasses LOL. We had to drink that from the tiny crappy ones already on the table. The food was OK but it was expensive for what it was. All in all, we would never go back.

There's a bar-like sitting area in the front, which I'd imagine is good for having an appetizer and a cocktail. The main seating area isn't too loud and good for conversations. This is a great spot for a date or large group.My experience here was overall great - I'd be interested in returning and trying a few other dishes.FoodFor appetizers, I had the tabbouleh and jalapeño hummus. The tabbouleh tasted fresh, and lemony, but had just a bit too much olive oil. The jalapeño hummus was also great with a spicy kick. It came with a generous side of perfectly puffy, warm pita bread that I used as a side for my entire meal. I'd definitely recommend the jalapeño hummus, but you can probably skip the tabbouleh.The roasted chicken was juicy and tender. It came mixed with various grilled vegetables (zucchini, peppers etc) that were a bright, healthy addition to the meal. My favorite part was the aioli-style garlic whip on the side. It served as a zesty accompaniment to the chicken, and I found myself constantly dipping my chicken and veggies in it between every bite.",1,0,1,Anushka M.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",320,14,18
5.0,2/11/2019,"Oftentimes restaurant week menus are skimpy and don't offer the restaurant's best selection. This was not the case at ilili! I went with my boyfriend and another couple. When you have four people dining and you can each get 2 starters, which is quite generous, you go all out--we go the hummus, mouhmara, fattoush, moussaka, falafel, arnabeet mekle, farmhouse burrata ($8 upcharge), and chicken livers. All were great but the burrata, fattoush, and falafel were outstanding. My main was the lamb makloubeh, which was clearly the best out of the group. The lamb was incredibly well-cooked and seasoned. My boyfriend got the salmon, which was good, too, but the lamb was out of this world. For dessert I got the ilili candy bar which was delicious and a small in portion, which was needed after all the other food we eat. The texture and sweetness of the pastry and ice cream was perfect. Finally, to drink I got the from Beirut with passion, which I enjoyed, but was quite sweet so would not recommend for those who don't like their drinks too saccharine.

5.0,2/6/2019,"One of my favorite Mediterranean restaurants in New York City is Ilili, a Lebanese eatery where tradition meets creativity and sophistication. Chef-Owner Philippe Massuod has created a menu that not only sticks to his roots but also adds a contemporary flair fit for the glitz and glam of New York City. While the menu boasts delicious hummus options, decadent lamb variations, fresh seafood courses and beautifully seasoned and cooked beef dishes, my absolute favorite dish at Ilili is their Brussels Sprouts which are cooked with Fig Jam, Walnuts and Mint Yogurt making for an insanely flavored packed bite that'll have you salivating for more.

5.0,2/3/2019,"On the first Friday of this year's restaurant week I arranged a dinner for three here. It was our first time here. I was 30 minutes late and they accommodated us. We had the opportunity to take advantage of the happy hour, which was good and after receiving our drinks we were finally seated. The cool thing about this place was for $42 you get to order four things. I went with the steak tartare with onions and jalapenos and the fattoush salad. The tartare was a small portion designed to be cut into quarters to accommodate the perfect balance bite.  Therefore the bite tasted good with everything combined. Next the fattoush salad arrived.  The salad was refreshing, very minty and crispy due to the toasted pita chips, which worked really well after eating the tartare. I started getting full and the main entree: Lamb Makboubeh came and it was meaty, gamey and hearty especially with the dirty rice and mixed nut mixture. The cucumber yogurt sauce really helped mask the gaminess of the lamb shank. I was so full that I ate half of the dish and took the rest home. Finally the dessert came and it was a smaller version of the ilili candy bar which tasted so good and was a perfect end to the meal.  Overall the restaurant was busy and after paying our bill, the hostess had to ""kick us out"" of the table for new guests. She was really nice and accommodating by providing us witha free drink at their lounge. I ordered the ""From Beirut with Passion"" cocktail which is a basil cilantro mint infused vodka with sparkling passion fruit. This drink after was much stronger than the happy hour version.

Food comes out really fast and all at once, so order bit-by-bit if you don't want to rush through dinner.- From Manhattan to Beirut- orange blossom water added a hint of sweet and lightened up this bourbon drink- Emerald Mirage- the elderflower was a bit too sweet for me in this gin, basil drink- Labne- thick and creamy, ask for extra crackers to enjoy- Leabnese thyme salad ($18)- you can really taste the herbs in this fresh green salad, recommend- Feta cheese with onions, tomato, zaatar- ($16) a bit pricey, but you get a LOT of cheese served in a pretty glass jar. It is very good, eat with everything else you order. This would be a good deal if you have a large group to share with, but it's a bit too much for one or two. Wish there was a half size- Brussels sprouts ($18) were nicely cooked, but on the sweet side with the fig jam. Liked the combo with fresh grapes and would have loved a bit more minty yogurt.- Phoenician fries ($14) my fave dish of the night. The spices are addictive and garlic dipping sauce good on everything!- Black iron shrimp ($18) 6 pieces, perfectly cooked, but strong on the pepper flavor. Fine, but not my fave- Octopus ($24) nice and tender- Pita bread served complimentary is warm and poofy, but not the best tasting version I've ever had.This was MORE than enough for 3 people to share.

4.0,11/14/2018,"ilili falls into one of those categories of NYC restaurants where you should definitely go as a group so you try out more of the menu, particularly the hot/cold small dishes. The space feels less like the Nomad and more like somewhere in midtown with a cavernous dining room and more than enough space to move your chair back and listen to the person sitting next to you. This would be good for a family reunion or a work dinner - dates are better suited to the cute bar off to the side of the dining room. I loved everything I ate but definitely some more than others:- The Phoenician fries. Definitely the highlight of the meal. They sprinkled some kind of herb salt mix on top and I couldn't stop eating them. I love when fries are made extra crispy and slightly burnt, and these were that perfect level of crunchiness. - The octopus. I can't skip it if I see octopus on the menu, just because I'm curious as to how well a place does it. Having never made it before, it seems finicky to get just right. ilili's version came with squash and onion, and was so tender it tasted like a better chicken. - Brussels sprouts with grapes, fig jam, and yogurt. A unique combination that I'll try out for Thanksgiving this year. The only ingredient I didn't love so much with this were the walnuts - I'd swap almonds or pine nuts to add the crunch. - Beef shawarma. They came wrapped individually like ice cream cones so you didn't get your hands messy with the oil slicking out. Pretty ingenious. I was so stuffed by this time but I still managed a few bites - the tender beef with tahini definitely stands out. The other things we tried (but I would skip next time): - Cauliflower. Tasty but the actual cauliflower piece was very, very small for $16. Most of the dish consisted of the tahini labne at the bottom. - Hummus with jalapeño. It pains me to write this but it was just alright. The jalapeño tended to overwhelm the subtler flavor of the hummus and, again, for a $10 dish, a lot of it was just the olive oil drizzled on top. - Beef fried kibbeh. Should have eaten this as soon as it arrived but I left my particular piece sitting for too long and the whole thing was too dry. - The side of pita. The bread is always the silent killer of $$$-$$$$ restaurants - it's something that's easily overlooked but I do think it's a marker for how much a restaurant might pay attention to the smaller details. ilili's pita were very dry and stale.

5.0,11/10/2018,"Oh Ilili, I can write poetry books and songs about you. I love you, I love you ,I love you! I am Lebanese born and raised. When I visit a new city  I look for a good Lebanese place to try. I came to Ilili after seeing all the good reviews and decided to try it out. First of all, don't order the entrees, they're not bad but they're not the best thing here and you can probably have the same ones somewhere else for cheaper. The best thing here is their mezza or appetizers. They have so many options to try from, there really is no need to get an entree. The mezza is what us Lebanese people love to eat, many reasons for that, one is because we love to enjoy multiple dishes and Lebanese mezza is pretty amazing in general. What the chefs at Ilili did was take the traditional Lebanese Mezza and elevate it to a much higher level with a twist. The word Ilili means ""tell me"" in Lebanese Arabic and let me tell you something, when you have the food here your taste buds will dance in harmony and you will be in a happy state of mind you forget the world around you exists. I am not exaggerating. My favorite Mezza dishes were the Atayef with the veal bacon, the duck shawarma, the kibbeh nayyeh and falafel. You have to, absolutely must get at least these four dishes. I will be coming back to Ilili every time I am in New York, I miss it so much I can't take it.",4,0,1,Maya H.,"Covina, CA",88,164,195
2.0,11/5/2018,"Expensive and mediocre. We had a reservation at 10pm and they didn't seat us until 10:20pm on a Friday night. I also heard other patrons upset that they weren't being seated at their reservation times. We ordered the hummus, octopus, cauliflower, and duck schwarma. The hummus was good but the rest was forgettable. The octopus smelled fishy and lacked acid and the duck schwarma was really dry. They got one extra star for the good service.

Reservation was at 9:30 and they sat us almost at 10pm (place was full, but we had a reservation) So I said food should be really good to erase this hehe. So we got a table and Isaac served us. Truly great Hospitality. Offered a great Argentinian Wine at a moderate price and we ordered to the center of the table. We were 6. Food was awesome. The duck shawarma, the octopus, the libanie, hummus, I mean everything. Then the chocolate dessert was great but not enough. (It is never enough chocolate, NEVER HEHE) overall great service/hospitality, great food, good wine. (Btw runner and busser really well trained too, congrats) thank you very much.

5.0,11/2/2018,"I've eaten at Lebanese restaurants all over the world and few can compare to the delicious food, beautiful presentation and chill vibe of illili. I've dined here several times and have tried the traditional staples of hummus, baba ganoush and tabouli on each occasion. I have never been disappointed, but suggest trying the establishment's interpretation of the less popular but equally delectable dishes. I was particularly impressed with the kibbeh naye which is served fresh as a tween with attitude with garnishes of onions and mint. It is truly outstanding. If you're looking for another one-off dish, try the buratta with apricot and pistachio. It can trick your palate into wondering whether you're eating an appetizer or a scrumptious dessert - truly ambrosial!  One item that I love but didn't see this week the shakshouka.  It may have been a special when I last tried it or possibly a brunch serving; so if you ever go for brunch, keep an eye out for it. Amazing how such a basic dish can be so satiating and palate-pleasing. Having said all this, your overall experience won't be inexpensive.  Make sure to bring  some big spender attitude and hit the ATM for some fast cash before showing up for your incomparable experience.",1,1,1,John S.,"Bernardsville, NJ",31,24,97
2.0,11/1/2018,"Mediterranean food is one of my favorite kinds of cuisine and we eat it frequently because my partner can get meaty things and I can get vegan things. Although it seems the best hummus and falafel is often served at modest fast casual places, I do like venturing out and trying restaurants with ambiance, especially for dinner. Ilili is close to where I work and I was sold on making a reservation as soon as I saw the photos featuring soaring ceilings and ambient lighting. Unfortunately, it was a total miss for us from the moment they sat us in that forgettable side room that made me feel I was in some kind of event tent. Why seat your reservations in what is clearly an afterthought room? There were some service errors that you wouldn't expect at this price point, also considering how many different people serve your table. When the first person came over to ask what kind of water we wanted, I figured that was a good sign and that we'd be expertly attended to. Not quite. Our main server was nice enough but pretty absent throughout the meal. We placed an order for the Phoenician fries as an app while we pored over the list of small plates, as well as some drinks. The drinks arrived but the fries didn't. Next thing we knew, all of the small plates were on the table (too quickly. Give us some time to enjoy our drinks and eat those fries that never came). Being that I'm all about hot sauce, namely harissa, I asked for it, as it looked like the only accompanying sauce was tahini with the falafel. Good thing I did because I found the falafel to be dry (the amount of tahini could be a bit larger to combat this) and the hummus, pretty bland. I also had a bowl of salad with Lebanese thyme, which was lightly dressed and lemony. This is delicious but pretty steep at $18, considering that it contained at most 2 olives cut in half and a small amount of greens. I also had to add salt to it. The harissa that I had to ask for again because apparently I had to put in an actual order for it, was a plentiful two scoops and tasty, but I only needed a little. I knew I'd be paying for it, which I am also not used to doing, even in more upscale Mediterranean places. We had to ask for those fries after all and the waiter was super apologetic, offering to cancel them altogether. I don't quite get that, when what should have happened was that they were promptly served and taken off the bill. Although fairly flavorful with sumac, they were soggy/greasy and needed salt. The garlic whip, however, is standout. I could just put that on pita (preferably not their pita, as it, too, is disappointing compared to other flatbread that you'd expect in a place of this alleged caliber).Disappointing experience and forgettable food. The bill came to a staggering 140 dollars for a round of drinks and 5 small plates (including the fries and $4 for harissa ""extra large,"" which I never specified). I'm fine with paying this amount if the food and experience are excellent but I left here unhappy and don't expect to return.",18,6,10,Joi B.,"Hudson Valley, NY",3982,1796,1305

We started with the grape leaves appetizer (in Greek we call them Dolmades) but I can't remember the name in Lebanese. They were good, but very small, and honestly mine are better, much much better, but they were very good! Next was the falafel. OK, you say, falafel? This was no ordinary falafel. What a lovely flavor and spices blended just right with the perfect consistency tahini. Oh Yum! Last we shared the duck shawarma. These were delicious! Just perfect and with sharing the first two dishes and the duck we were completely satisfied! Not stuffed, but satsified.

To the woman in the black dress and blonde hair, I'm not sure if you're the host or the manager, but thank you for coming up to our group and explaining what the issue was. Even though our party gave you a hard time/were rude, you were super professional and accommodating. You bought us a round of drinks despite us being a large party. Thank you for the hospitality...none of the others in the group have ever worked in the service industry, clearly, and don't know what it's like to run a place smoothly on a Saturday night. Besides this, the food was AMAZING. Beware of the hummus, it was addicting. I wish I hadn't eaten so much so as to not have enough room for the rest of the delicious food we ordered. If nothing else, try the brussel sprouts. So bomb! The falafel was cute and served in 4 with a flavorful taste and not dry at all like some falafel can be. We also ordered the semolina gnocchi and it was soooo good but we were too full by the end unfortunately to enjoy it fully :(. Less is more at this place!

2.0,10/20/2018,"I'm Lebanese so I had high expectations especially given the marketing that was put into hyping up the restaurant. For appetizers, we ordered the kibbeh neyeh, hummus basterma, rekakat cheese rolls, and the heirloom tomato salad. For the price and reviews, i was expecting flavour that was exceptional compared to what I've known all my life. The kibbeh neyeh was amazing, made to perfection. The hummus basterma was great too but I would suggest that the restaurant use a better quality olive oil, olive oil should not be in a clear bottle otherwise it goes rancid/ bitter, so the olive oil did bring down the quality. The heirloom tomato salad and rekakt cheese rolls weren't exceptional, I've had better. Those were not worth the price.For the main, we had the semolina gnocchi and the lamb maklouba, both lacked flavour and salt. I loved the Mediterranean concept of the semolina gnocchi, it has so much potential. Maybe some fried garlic and red pepper paste topping would've upped the flavour. It really has potential but I was not impressed. The lamb makloubeh was beautifully presented but the lamb was dry, the rice lacked flavour and the eggplants were burnt. I liked the cucumber yogurt side that came with it.Our server, Star, was a star, she was great! All smiles and hospitable, keep that energy up.

Excited perusing the menu and reading reviews on yelp however the food is not anything special and the wait to place an order and for the food to come out was long and ridiculous. No update on the status of our food, took 10 mins to even place the order for our food but accommodating us as we were late to our reservation was nice and timely so overall 3 Stars.The food was good but for the amount your paying you expect a little more creativity and flavor in the food. Starting off with the mouhamara, it was ok. Proportions were good but a bit dry. Flavor was slightly lacking, ours maybe were made with a tad too many walnuts and was not put together to well. The warm eggplant was good. Texture cooked evenly, not too salty pared well with the scallions and molasses. The duck shawarma was good too. Wish they were wrapped in pita that was thinner to enjoy all the other flavors and sort of took away from the fish and lastly the lamb chops were a bit greasy. Cooked to a well medium rare, wish the cuts of meat weren't like 35% fat with more meat.  Overall the food was ok in relation to the prices...wish the service made up for it a bit because you do go to dine at these places to enjoy your experience but that wasn't there either.

The black tea basil strawberry drink was not at all sweet, which threw me off at first, and then I started to like it. Felt like an unsweetened ice tea with everything working together for a low tone impact. The chicken livers had a great gamy flavor, but what ever sauce it sat it made it even better. It provided a sweetness that kept the lovers from going out of control. They also added some depth I normally don't see paired with the livers.  The lamb sausage Had a sweet, but mostly vinegar base with citrus notes (oranges or persimmons?) The texture of the sausage has this chew to it that reminds me of balled up spinach. Not a bad thing but not what I'm expecting. They packed plenty of juice and had a great lamb flavor.  The falafel was disappointing. Has a great crisp on the outside, but the inside lacked character and felt bland.

4.0,9/4/2018,"First, I must begin with everything wonderful about my experience here. Today I'm with two fun dinner partners and we're in a great mood. Ilili has a great bar and bar/lounge. Attractive, high ceilinged, open space. Please note the date:  It is Tuesday September 4. Which means that half of NYC still is away. Only the people with kids are back. We had not made a reservation. We were planning on going to Eataly (Il Pesce) which is a fave, but decided to try something new. I had passed Ilili many times and had wanted to go in. The hostess and other host, bartender and wait staff were lovely. Warm, funny, easy-going and friendly. For appetizers we had the Cauliflower, the Phoenician fries and the Brussel sprouts. Absolutely superlative!!  For dinner we had the Gnocchi, the Kafta and the Trout (pictured). All very good. The gnocchi were unlike traditional Italian gnocchi, but delicious. We would suggest lessening the cream. Overall, the appetizers are better than the entrees. So, now for the less than wonderful...you're getting my pet peeve:  I HATE it when you walk into a restaurant at 6pm (!!) to find the place COMPLETELY EMPTY and the hosts are cautious about the tables that they will make available to you. There's a saying, ""better a bird in the hand than  a hundred in the bush.""  We show up and we say that we want to sit so we can get started on drinks (where restaurants make their money -- and btw, we bought three rounds of drinks). Hmmmm, do you screw around being uncertain about putting us at an iffy table in the middle (toward the back) of the restaurant near a swinging door saying that you have (supposed) reservations for ALL (really?) of the other tables OR do you happily put us at the table at the front window??  Here are photos at 6:45, 7:25 and (as we're about to leave) 8:25.  Open tables....ALL evening!  See my review of The Cecil (which closed) that employed this same ""oh, you can't have this table because they are all reserved"" tactic. So all that said, I WILL be back. The food is great and the servers well trained and lovely. I will probably sit in the lounge/bar area and have appetizers rather than sitting in the main dining room, albeit attractive.",0,0,0,Lad R.,"Manhattan, NY",2,29,13

2.0,9/1/2018,"Come here for a 2 star experience. It has gotten progressively worse for each of the three times I've been here since 2015. To start, the hostess was rude and dismissive when she was moving us from the waiting area to the table. Herded cattle get treated better. However, the most unbearable part of dinner was the wait for food and service. Our party of 5 arrived promptly for our 8:30pm reservation and didn't get to place our order for food or drink until an hour later when our waitress came to take our order, who was nice enough but still delayed. It seemed like the ratio of busboys to servers was highly disproportionate. When our food finally arrived, the pita was cold and hard. Our pita basket tasted like a reunion between all the leftover bread from the evening. That said, the food was not much better. Be warned, do not order the falafel. They come in rectangles, which I'm not discriminating against in itself, except for the fact that the corners were so overcooked, hard and tasteless. It was also about $3 per falafel, which is crazy. Unfortunately for us, the dishes came out so unevenly paced and slow that we didn't get the next dish until 30 mins later to wash the taste out. The lamb meatballs were pretty good, but not good enough to let us forget about how long we've waited for them. At 10pm, we finally got our roasted chicken. Tasted good but $47 for a roasted chicken served at 10pm is pretty criminal. Also served with butter knives for some reason. Any other dishes ordered were unremarkable. Something was clearly going on in the kitchen. To their defense, it was Labor Day Weekend and they might not have been operating with full staff. Our group was so dissatisfied with our experience we contemplated many times just leaving cash on the table and leaving. If it wasn't for the first experience I had at ilili in 2015 and the redeeming lamb meatballs, this would be a 1 star review.",2,2,0,Sydney L.,"Williamsburg - North Side, Brooklyn, NY",372,63,10

For entrees, he ordered lamb and I ordered the chicken.The hummus had too much olive oil in it that made my stomach feel sick afterwards. The pita bread with the hummus was delicious though -- fluffy, warm, and soft. The fries were also pretty good. The octopus salad was whatever; it tasted flavorless. The chicken entree also tasted bland and burnt.

3.0,8/17/2018,"My friends and I came for restaurant week. Our waiter seated us and then explained how the food would be coming out as it was ready. We expected each course to come out much faster but it was pretty standard timing. I guess it was because the restaurant was busy. We actually had to ask the waiter to check on our entrees because a while had passed. Dishes:(Pita bread for the table)Appetizers:- Hommus (kind of sour)- Fattoush (so sour my friend could not finish her dish, comes with sumac lemon vinaigrette)- Steak tartare (does not come in pieces, my friend described the texture as 'like eating butter', I definitely wouldn't get this again)- Moussaka (sort of like eating eggplant that was cooked in a pasta sauce)- Falafel (this was really good! Probably the best appetizer)- Arnabeet Mekle (the cauliflower was great, the tahini was really good but a little sour)- Tuna Tartare (probably the second best appetizer)Mains:- Salmon a La Plancha (really good, the salmon was soft and delicate, the skin was crunchy and my favourite part)- Diver Scallops (very soft and tasty)- Lamp Chops (very well done, not tough at all, definitely try it!)Desserts:- Ilili Candy Bar (my favourite part of the meal. It's very sweet!)- Labne Cheesecake (the cucumber sherbet was not bad but not great either)What I noticed is that most of the appetizers were sour in some way.

WINNING. Between 4 people we were able to try 8 appetizers! They had falafel, mousaka, hummus, salad, everything! It was a great variety of apps and all of them were great.3 people got the lamp chops and I got the salmon. All very tasty and well cooked.

Glad to have a chance to try it during the NYC summer restaurant week (goes from July 23-August 17). For $42 per person, it was well worth it. We came here with a group of 4. The waiters were courteous. With reservation, there was a 5-10 mins wait. Not so bad given it was a Friday evening. There was a 4 course meal offered for the restaurant week. 2 appetizers, 1 main course and 1 desert. Plenty of impressive choices for the appetizer. All of us ordered appetizers and shared as a group, so we got to try all of those dishes. Personally, I chose Tuna Tartare and Warm Eggplants. Tuna Tartare was amazingly done and so delicious. Eggplants were good but Tuna Tartare was better.As a main course, I picked Lamb chops. They are so delicious it's out of this world. (There was $11 extra charge, but well worth it). Desert come with three choices. My choice was ilili candy bar.

5.0,8/7/2018,"Had an amazing experience here at ilii!! Came with three other friends for restaurant week & we all agreed that the food was delicious and the deal was well worth the money. Honestly my favorite restaurant week restaurant I've dined at in the last year. The amount of food we got for $42 was absolutely insane. One of my friends and I decided to order a bunch of different things and share. They also serve warm, unlimited pita bread to dip all of your sauces in!! I'll review everything we tried:-Hummus (5 stars): This hummus was so creamy and smooth I loved it! There is a clear difference between this & what you find at the store/cheaper restaurants. I also loved the lemony flavor that was kind of infused-Mouhamara (4 stars): kind of a walnutty dip, really delicious! weird, but reminded me of the fake taco meat that comes on top of the By Chloe taco salad.-Organic Heirloom Tomato Salad (4 stars): tasted very fresh & was a beautiful dish. didn't blow my mind, but was a very solid dish-Arnabeet Mekle (5 stars): this was the table's favorite appetizer across the board. It was essentially roasted cauliflower on top of a tahini type spread. Really delicious & would highly recommend!-Semolina Gnoochi (2 stars): this dish was just extremely heavy and the gnocchi didn't have much flavor... I didn't really enjoy this-Salmon a la plancha (4 stars): delicious salmon, cooked medium. It was a little too raw for me, so i'd ask to have it cooked a little more if you like your fish a little more well-done-ilili candy bar (4 stars): really sweet and delicious cant go wrong with this choice-labne cheese cake (5 stars): was expecting a slice of cheese cake, but this dish was a lot smaller and more delicate, which was a good thing! I loved the cucumber flavor, it was light and a great palette cleanser to the end of the mealhighly would recommend ilili, whether it be for restaurant week or normal dining.

The restaurant has a very classy ambience and gives polite and efficient service. I ordered Fattoush salad and a glass of chilled Lebanese lager beer. While waiting for my ala carte serving I was brought apricot spread and two delicious biscuits.When my salad arrived I thought for a moment that the wrong meal was being served as it was literally smothered in crackers. I had to dig with my fork to retrieve my salad buried underneath. The salad itself was fresh and tangy. Still, I was disappointed.

2.0,7/25/2018,"Had a negative experience at ilili for a birthday dinner. I had heard of ilili before and was expecting great food and service, but it fell short. The food itself was quite mediocre- for appetizers we got the hummus, baba ganoush, and tabouleh. All 3 were fine, but definitely nothing that you can't find in the Sabra Mediterranean section of your local supermarket... For my main I got the citrus trout, and it was delicious, but it was $38 and didn't even come with a side of grains or vegetables. The prices in general were a bit ridiculous. And the place is nice, but there was nothing that special about the decor or ambiance. But the worst part was the service- we had a party of 11 people, but half of the party was served their main course while the other half never got theirs. They ended up just canceling their orders because the other half were already done eating and they still didn't get their food over an hour later.

Our waitress was very pleasant and personable, and we really enjoyed the atmosphere. Despite all the courses, we were barely full. The hostess is beyond awful though. I was there 5 minutes after my reservation and told her it's for a birthday. Nothing was done for that later. She said it would be a few minutes, which was fine because my friend was running late. After 15 minutes, the table was ready and I asked for a minute to find my friend. Less than 60 seconds later, she gave away our table! She then gave us a pretentious lecture about how we were ""so late"" and now must wait an unpredictable amount of time. If not for my friend, I would have left. A few minutes later, we finally got another table and saw many open tables inside. Please retrain this woman. She should not be greeting people with her sour face and nasty attitude.

We had high expectations, especially after viewing their attractive website, and they weren't met. Positives1. The lamb chops I had as an entree were tender and flavorful. Others in my party also had and recommended the falafel. 2. As a celiac, I truly appreciated the server's attention to my food allergy. He alerted me as to all orders on the table that contained gluten, just in case I decided to share plates. Negatives1. Stuffed grape leaves were bland and tiny.  I am amazed at how tightly and neatly they were wrapped, given their size. 2. Entree portions are rather small, especially at these prices. The serving of three entree chops for $48 looked more like an appetizer/starter, especially given that it was served with three medium roasted tomatoes and mache. 3. While the bar area is well appointed, the dining room looked dated.

Our introduction to the restaurant left a bad taste in my mouth. Dinner service was better. Our waitress was informed, attentive and polite. I did feel that the larger parties got more attention, which was fair. We ordered a bottle of wine and 5 mezze plates for the two of us. Biggest hit was the baba ganoush - smoky but light and enjoyably retained the eggplant flavor. The falafel were really nicely flavored, despite being made unnecessarily fancy fried in a square shape. (Why?) Tahini was rich and light at the same time with strong flavor-- as it should be here. Octopus dish was mediocre. Nothing even descriptive here. Pretty (!) but otherwise 'meh'.

We ordered hummus and since I couldn't eat the pita (I snuck a bite and it was delicious), he sent out crudite at no charge. He was so helpful with good suggestions for me and pairings for both of us. Our drinks were never empty or even close to empty. I don't know her title--if she was the general manager or something else--but the woman working the front of house was just as nice and came over to visit with us, sharing our love for the halva ice cream. The whole thing was such a good experience. Not only will I recommend Ilili to friends but I'll make an effort to return for future trips.

2.0,5/19/2018,"This place is overpriced in my opinion. The food and the service is fine, but not remarkable, and there are other restaurants in the neighborhood with better fare for less.The redeeming quality is the space, which is gorgeous. The ceilings are high, and the main room is quite spacious. This is not unusual for hotel restaurants in NYC, because the hotel pays for the real estate and the restaurant is effectively an amenity so it can be subsidized by the profits from the hotel. The bathrooms are amazing, with bossa nova piped in over loudspeakers into immaculate private stalls with cloth towels and heavy wooden sliding doors that provide extra privacy.Avoid being seated in the back section if it's crowded! It's okay when they're not busy, but since they changed up their menu a few weeks ago and started promoting more aggressively, it's been packed, and the low ceilings make it very loud. What's worse, in the back area the person seated on the bank gets basically locked in. The tables are so close together that the waiter actually moves them to let people in and out. This is insane to me. It's incredibly awkward when you need to go to the bathroom and there's no waiter nearby, so you have to move the table yourself and squeeze through, risking accidentally knocking over something on the adjoining table.",0,0,0,William J.,"New York, NY",283,113,84
5.0,5/18/2018,"I first came to this amazing Labenese upscale restaurant some 3.5 years ago and recently went back for dinner. It has since become a very popular establishment, so make your reservations before you go unless you go on a late Tuesday night like my friends and I did. For apettizers, we ordered the following: Hummus with lamb, baba gannoush, labne, fattoush, burrata, Moussaka with warm pitas. One thing, please do not order the falafel here, it is not the best item on the menu. For the main course, we ordered the roasted chicken and shared amongst us since we over indulged on the apps The staff was polite and got us the extra Somouak on the side as I wanted to introduce my friends to it. I had a glass of red wine as recommended by the server and it was very light bodied wine (I am not a wine drinker nor a fan unless it is a sangria).

5.0,5/13/2018,"This was a great Lebanese/fusion restaurant with some authentic and some Americanized dishes.  HUMUS:  Excellent-but not very challenging.PITA:  Amazing, very unusual texture and consistancy.CHICKEN LIVER MOUSSE:  Fabulous-the best clm we've evern had in 1/2 a century. Great compote of pomgranate:  how do you do that? Lots of seeds. BEEF KIBBE:  This is a wonderful dish at any Lebanese restaurant.  It's a must try.  Very interesting spicing. CROQUETTE:  Similar to kibbe, but with lentils inside, and a very interesting curry yoghurt dip. VEGETABLE PIZZA:  Mostly shitake mushrooms, but very nicely done-a sharp feta like cheese.  LAMB BURGER:  Excellent spicing, authentic Lebanese style pickles on the side.  Well prepared. FETA CHEESE DIP WAS COMPLIMENTARY:  Very nice.ROAST LAMB WITH VEGETABLES AND FARRO:  Excellent. Try the small plates, rather than the main courses-very satisfying.  $42 per person with tip for table of 5.  On the other hand, it is more appealing to people who prefer ""Americanized"" food, though they have some very sophisticated taste and preparation skills.  There were a lot of Lebanese, Egyption, Syrian people enjoying the food-but definately ""yuppy-ish"".  I think I prefer Naya: great preparation, more traditional, very elegant, less of a ""yuppy"" place, and less availability (smaller space).   Still both are 5 star in my book.",0,0,0,Neal G.,"Manhattan, NY",15,59,0

To my surprise, they make their own pita bread, unlike other restaurants, which is served with dinner and it's the best pita bread I've ever tasted -- fresh and still warm when served. If I could eat here everyday, I would. The service was great as well. The New York City restaurant scene is hard to thrive in, but ilili was surprisingly the best food I've had in the city thus far, and there is no shortage of delicious eats in NYC. The pricing is also very fair to the quality of food being served, I did not find it to be that overpriced compared to other restaurants in the city.

After telling them there were two of us, I was directed to the lounge and took a seat at the bar. While waiting for the table I had a glass of Lebanese wine. I had no idea there were vineyards there, but you learn something every day and the wine was good. Aa we got to the table we were handed menus and served a yogurt dish with what i believe were pita crackers. When the waiter saw how much we loved it he brought us more. My sister and I split a Brussels sprouts appetizer that came with grapes, fig jam, walnuts, and mint yogurt. When it was time to order entrees, my sister ordered Kafta, which isspiced ground beef & lamb, sumac garlic whip, and seasonal grilled vegetables. She ordered that with a rice dish and at this point I thank our parents for teaching us to share because her meal was delicious. For myself I ordered Lamb Makloubeh. It was lamb shank, dirty rice, fried eggplant, cucumber yogurt, and mixed nuts. The Lamb had to have been slow roasted because there was no bone and it just melted in my mouth. It will be hard for me to order anything else. Dessert? The great wait staff offered it, but there  was no room.

I could feel it was so freshly made with wonderful flavors and the bread being warm with fluffy texture fresh out of the oven.We got labne which was again well made , slightly on the tangy side. The Riz was cooked on the drier side. Nice flavors of the nuts. My friends got the mekanek and grilled octopus for the starters. They didn't like the dish too much. The meat want well cooked or maybe that is something which we prefer and probably should have mentioned before. For the main course I got the semolina gnocchi. I just wish it wasn't so dry and had a bit more flavors. Although I loved the drinks here. We ordered the Arak. I had never tried it before and I think it's kind of like absinthe with its refreshing flavor. The service was wonderful. We got the food really fast and all points for presentation.

I would skip the chicken livers they were to burned and very sour for my taste. The kabob karez on the other hand was really good. They are a bit weird given they look like meatballs and I'm used to kabob on skewers. Nevertheless the taste was great and the meatball shape was good for appetizers when you want to only taste. For my main dish I went with lamb mahklouba. It was delicious! I highly recommend it. The lamb was very tender that it melts in your mouth. The combination with the yogurt makes it super good. My wife went with the lamb chops, I gave them a try and they were just ok. By far I made the better choice.Finally we concluded with Bakhlava which was ok nothing special. They were small 6 pieces.

We definitely ordered 1 or two more items but those are the ones I remember off the top of my head. We also had to get an additional order for many of these mezze because 1 portion was not enough. Overall, the food did not compare to any Lebanese food we had tried in the past, whether it was homemade Lebanese food, authentic Lebanese food in Beirut, or local Lebanese restaurants that we had tried in the past.

The dry rosé was like drinking strawberry Capri Sun, blech. To top it all off, our waiter was absolutely terrible. He didn't know the menu and when we asked him a question about one of the dishes, he said ""hold on let me go ask!"" And disappeared for 10 minutes. This happened twice!

It didn't take 3 hours long this time and the restaurant wasn't as crowded. But that could be because the day I went it was right before Christmas weekend.I came with a friend who works as a line cook at a couple of pretty popular restaurants, so we left the ordering up to him. What we ordered was even better than what I had during restaurant week, even though we pretty much had their whole menu the first time I came.Mouhamara - This was the only thing that I had last time, that I requested we get again. It's basically a sweet, savory walnut paste that tastes amazing with the pita. It was just as good as before.Moussaka - This tastes similar to many tomatoey eggplant I've had before. It's nothing really special but maybe good for a healthy dish.Phoenician Fries - I wish I ordered this the first time. The fries were large and crispy with lots of herbs. Holy f**k that garlic whip was good with the fries .Duck Shawarma - I was hesitant on getting this, because I thought it wouldn't really taste like duck, but this was so good. It didn't actually have a very strong duck flavor because it's shredded. The garlic whip with it is delicious. You choose 2 large ones, or 4 little ones. Octopus with squash, onion, peppers, mekanek, pine nuts - pretty good. octopus was charred and tender. I like all the vegetables mixed in. Mixed Grill with chicken shish taouk, beef kebab, kafta, lamb chops, garlic whip trio, seasonal grilled vegetables - This is great for sharing and comes with a trio garlic whip (mint, beet, and sumac). The beef kebab was tender and medium rare. The chicken was a little dry, but the kafta was great. I think I like their appetizers and dessert more, but this was a good entree.ilili Candy Bar - I got this during restaurant week too and I loved it just as much as I did the first time. I'm glad it's still on the menu after almost three years. I love the contrast between the smooth dark chocolate ganache and the gritty pistachio layer. Definitely for chocolate lovers or those with a sweet tooth.

Now the food is just ok, the wait staff are slow at seating you, the bathroom staff sit there gawking at the ceiling, and they've added too many tables (to maximize profit) in the main dining hall so the place has the clamor of a school lunchroom. Staring at the menu pricing while hearing 10 conversations around you and [literally] rubbing elbows with the people at the next table makes you sit there and wonder what exactly you're paying for.",1,0,0,Artem K.,"Queens, NY",1,61,1
4.0,3/7/2018,"If you can somehow request upstairs seating, I think that's the way to go. You'll be seated in a small alcove area that's quiet vs. the rowdy downstairs hall (unless you're into screaming over dinner to get your party to hear you properly), and the decor upstairs was admittedly much nicer.That being said, ilili serves quite a bit of appetizers (cold/hot) as well as main entrees. For a group of 5, we ordered around 7 or 8 appetizers and a main entree, and we could barely finish. They recommend ~3 appetizers per person, but I'd like to think it's better to stay on the safe side and order more as necessary.Of all the dishes we ordered, surprisingly, the Phoenician fries were the real winners for me. The garlic aioli this came with was extremely flavorful, and I ended up dipping nearly everything in it. The octopus appetizer was the other star of the night - we ended up ordering two of these, and contemplated ordering a third. The octopus was cooked really well, they weren't stingy with their portions, and they were sprinkled in a medley of vegetables and beef sausage bits that rounded out the flavors perfectly.Honorable mention goes out to the duck shawarma - some members in our group really loved that.Personally, I'd skip on the lamb dumplings and the cauliflower. Not worth the money or the stomach real estate, but to each their own.",3,4,3,Dan C.,"Manhattan, NY",24,128,24
4.0,3/5/2018,This place is way bigger inside then I would have expected! Lots of mirrors and the vibe is greAt for an upscale nyc dinner. The bar is completely separate from the restraint which is nice- there's a giant lounge area as well. The food was really delicious. We ordered a LOT of appetizers- the falafel is a must try- it's very savory and crunchy. Other stand outs include the hummus as well as the rice and the Brussels sprouts. The mixed grill plate is a MUST try - you can split it with the table and get a bunch of other apps. It has a tasting of all of the meat and it's fantastic!! I took a point off because I didn't think our server was that good - he didn't have any recommendations and was frankly not as pleasant as you'd expect from a restaurant of this caliber. Must call months in advance for real!! Also really like that the tables are round (we were a big group).,0,0,0,Melanie L.,"New York, NY",4,70,49

5.0,2/26/2018,"By far the best Mediterranean restaurant in NYC. We ordered hummus, labne(yogurt type of dip), duck shawarma, mixed grilled platter, falafel, and kibbeh. Everything was deliciously out of this world, but being such a fancy and pretty expensive restaurant, I would expect the food to be hot when brought to the table. We had to return two of the plates for them to heat them up, since they were brought to us cold. I must say, they handled the situation pretty well, and due to the food being cold, they took the two platters out of the bill. That's great customer service in my opinion. The hostess at the front was also very nice and attentive. I also think that a reservation is necessary to get a table, they are very busy all the time.

Although the service was a bit slow our waiter was very helpful and the dishes more than made up for it. We started with smaller, tapas-style appetizers that were astounding. Would highly recommend the Brussels sprout dish and the iron shrimp. We then moved on to the mixed grill which was a large portion for sharing. It included steak, chicken, kafta and lamb. We then finished the evening with a candy bar for dessert. Highly recommend this restaurant if you are spending an evening in the city.",0,0,0,Cristina B.,"Cambridge, MA",50,16,6

4.0,2/20/2018,"anytime you have over 2k reviews and 4 stars or better usually is a good sign. It is no different here except for a hiccup in service which I explain below. We came on a friday night and the place was bustling. We sat upstairs and although the tables are close to each other we had ample space.We went for the meze options rather than ordering entrees. The server sold us on the fact that we needed 8-9 small dishes which seemed like a lot but I knew she was worried we would take a table on a friday night and order like 3 meze plates. I am no rookie though so I wouldnt do that!!! I understand servers try to upsell the guest but its another thing to give wrong info since there was no way 2 people could eat that much food. For two people you only need 6 maybe 7 appetizers. The lebanese red wine was also unique and added to our experience. It has a little kick to it at the end which I liked.Now for the food: Must order- cauliflower, duck shawarma, lamb dumplings, phoenican fries, fresh pita's (they come at beginning of the meal)What I would pass on was the lamb sausage and cherry meatballsOverall, a solid 4 stars. the server had good intentions but it definitely rubbed me the wrong way.  I would come back.",9,3,6,Nicholas G.,"Hoboken, NJ",4373,1076,2695

3.0,2/18/2018,"I went here for restaurant week and it didn't completely live up to my expectations. I will say, for a restaurant week type of deal, you get to pick more appetizers than you normally are allowed. My boyfriend and I both got to pick 2 appetizers each, an entree, and dessert. The appetizers were pretty flavorful. Their pita was also extremely airy, puffy, and yummy. We ordered the hommus, moussaka, baba ghannouj, and the kibbeh naye beirutieh (steak tartar). The moussaka and baba ghannouj were extremely delicious and was definitely the best part of the meal. They had so much flavor and really captured the Mediterranean taste. The entree was very very subpar, I barely even finished mine. I got the semolina gnocchi and it just did not taste ""right"". It almost tasted a little sweet, but not in a familiar way. It was not what I expected. As for the dessert, not much can go wrong there especially since I ordered the ilili candy bar. It was a rich dark chocolate ganache, fig caramel, dulce de leche ice cream, topped with salted pistachios. To be honest, I don't remember tasting all of those ingredients, but it was pretty good. The true downfall to this restaurant would have to be its service. It was SO SLOW! Now I understand during restaurant week, there will definitely be a higher volume of customers, but it shouldn't take 10 mins to be asked what drink we would like to order, and another 10 mins afterwards to inform us that you don't have the ingredients to make the drink... by the time we actually ordered and got our drink it was already roughly 25-30 mins into sitting and still waiting for our meal.Come here for the atmosphere as it's a very pretty and ornate restaurant, I think you could find better Mediterranean food with better service.",0,0,0,Sarah C.,"New York, NY",396,145,197

The tables are very tightly packed but the ambinence is nice very sleek modern with flare.  We did the falafal for an app, it looked different but the taste was authentic so far so good. We also ordered some wine and the chicken duo and lamb makleoubah. The waiter tried to tell us that was not enough food and we will be hungry, which seemed like an upsell since we were not just ordering apps but meals.  We ended up being more than fine. We didn't even finish so didn't appreciate that part.  The food was authentic, I just wish they had better pairings. The chicken was a kebab it was good just needed some rice or vegetables on the side. We ended up ordering some rice on the side.

3.0,2/14/2018,"A nicer Mediterranean fusion place that actually delivers on food quality for the most part. Solid 4 star quality, but deducted one for a really slow service.Ambience - Restaurant is really well decorated. I don't normally take pictures of the restaurant, but this one is up there.Service - Painfully slow. Nice staff, but they explained the food 3 times for whatever reason. Again, it was painfully slow. Someone at my table ate an energy bar because the service was so slow...Food (Out of 7 appetizers and 5 main dishes)Good - Duck shawarma was delicious, but add sauce since it can get dry.  Brussel sprouts were surprisingly good, but the ratios were a bit off on actual Brussel sprouts to other ingredients.48 day dry aged cote de bouef was slightly overcooked and undersalted, but it was still enjoyable. It sucked that some parts of the beef were more delicious than the others, and it felt slightly overpriced, considering how awesome the dry aged beef at Minetta Tavern is for only a bit more.Lamb chops were pretty flavorful, if not a little intense at times.Alright - Fries are good. We mainly ordered it thinking it'd get here fast, and we needed something to munch on. Not sure why we're getting fries at a Mediterranean place, but it was decent.Not hot - Labne wasn't popular with any of the 8 at the table. It was barely touched. Mixed Grill had meats that were really dry or just absurdly tough.Dessert - It was pretty average. We got almost one of each, and the pumpkin souffle and labne cheesecake mousse were the only good ones.

Fortunately, every change made, made this dining experience even better than the last.The decor and ambiance of the restaurant has not changed and I'm glad it hasn't. The wood work and the mix of contemporary trims with classic accents really make the restaurant have character. It's quite a piece of art.The server that we had that night was one of the best I've had in quite a while. He had full knowledge of the menu, gave us the perfect amount of recommendations, and had just the right amount of intrusiveness that let us know he was our server without making us feel like we were hovered over. Drinks were never empty, plates were always clean, food came out perfectly timed. People, the kitchen doesn't always control the flow of food. Servers make that happen too. The food.... where do I begin. We had 11 mezza, 3 entrees, and 3 desserts. For a party of 4, it's a lot of food but we finished almost everything clean. We started the meal with ilili classics (Cold Mezza) like their signature Hommus, we had it with shrimp(highly recommend), moussaka (my second favorite), chankleesh (my personal favorite, definite must have), and the amazing kibbeh naye.  Everything was so on point and the flavors mixed with/out the fresh pita bread (which has become even more fluffy and delicious) were just bliss. As for the Hot Mezza, we had the brussel sprouts, (sweet, tart, delicious goodness), arnabeet mekle (fried cauliflower so good), kebab kerez (possibly the most interesting combination of flavors and textures that amazes me every time), manti(fluffy ""dumpling""), atayef and veal bacon (the Lebanese take on pork buns), duck shawarma (literally everything that is good in life is in here), and black iron shrimp (still good but perhaps the only average dish of the night). I made everyone eat with their hands and told them how to have a good time. For the Mains, we had the Cote de Boeuf (absof#$%inglutly the highlight of the meal), diver scallops, and the Whole Roasted Chicken (the flavors on this chicken and the presentation are to die for). Let's say we just saw bones left on our plates. Holy smokes I'm hungry again. Dessert, good ol Knafe bil Jibneh (IF YOU HAVE BEEN TO ILILI AND HAVE NOT HAD THIS OR IF YOU HAVE NOT BEEN TO ILILI, YOU MUST HAVE THIS), sorbets to clean the palette, and the labne cheesecake (interesting mix of yogurt to create a cheesecake flavor).We were so full at the end we couldn't leave for about 20 minutes.

The food options were great for sharing and we ordered multiple rounds after tasting and seeing what we liked. There was an awkward moment when ordering wine when I asked to taste a wine I chose and then didn't like it. It seemed corked and when I raised concerns with the waitress it took quite some time for them to come back with the menu and reconcile my concerns. It's certainly not the first nor the last time something like that will happen, so seeing staff shuffle to get a manager just to make sure I could be provided with another bottle was just bizarre.Not a place I'd go out of my way to return to, but wouldn't turn it down if in the neighborhood.",1,0,1,Kimberly T.,"New York, NY",53,405,12
4.0,2/11/2018,"A solid four star restaurant. We were so excited when we snagged reservations for ilili, looking at the 2k+ reviews we knew we were in for a treat!  It was 8pm on a Saturday night and we were out with our good friends, the night was already setting up to be awesome. First off, this place itself is massive!  We were seated promptly at an adorable table against a wall in one of the dining spaces.  The restaurant divided up the space so it doesn't feel cavernous, and adds a fun architectural feel to the room with all the wood and 30ish foot ceilings. The decor is simple without being bare, yet upscale in it's furnishings and accents. Although it was Restaurant Week, we opted to graze through the traditional menu - choosing to heed our waiters advice / suggestions for the ultimate meal.  His suggestions were spot on, and provided us with many dishes we might not have ordered on our own.  He also recommended a better wine for us, while staying in our price point - I always appreciate that, versus when a waiter suggests a bottle that $45 more than the one we originally picked out.We ordered an array of foods, and below I'll list them out with my thoughts.  My favorite favorite would be the duck shawarma - which shocked me, as well as the fries (yes, I know, but ... just try them!).   Dishes we ordered, below:Cold Mezza::: Baba Ghannouj - I'm always such a fan of this eggplant dish wherever I go - it was simple and yum!  Less garlic than I am used to, but good as a start!  (Eggplant, tahini, olive oil):: Labne - a slight bit boring to be truthful, tasted very much like plain greek yogurt, I think ours also was missing the roe? (Strained yogurt, olive oil, fresh mint, zaatar, salmon roe):: Tuna Tartare - fantastic!  Fresh, the lemon and the tuna were beautiful together, plus the pita added texture, a must-order (harissa, lemon, pita):: Chankleesh - super yummy! The waiter mashes up everything together dish - its salty and savory and really flavorful!  (feta cheese, onions, tomato, zaatar).Hot Mezza::: Black Iron Shrimp: really yummy, our waiter suggested tasting it with the Chankleesh which was really good (jalapeño, garlic, cilantro):: Phoenician Fries: i know, i know - ordering fries at a restaurant?? But our waiter recommended them and we listened - let me tell you - they were SO GOOD. PLUS the garlic whip was divine! (sumac, parsley, garlic whip):: Atayef & Veal Bacon: these looked comical - almost like a mini breakfast sandwich that you might find at mcdonalds or something... mini pancakes making a sandwich.  It tasted NOTHING like it appeared, they were a bit spicy, very savory, and highly recommend (fig jam, pickles, hot peppers):: Brussels Sprouts: a little too sweet for my taste honestly, but prepared really well - big hit on the table (grapes, fig jam, walnuts, mint yogurt):: Kebab Kerez: absolutely delicious, very sweet/savory with the lamb&beef combo in the cherry sauce... yum! (lamb & beef meatballs, cherry sauce, kataifi, scallions):: Duck Shawarma: my favorite dish of the night - 3 come to a serving, I believe so they added an extra for us - all the best flavors of shawarma, amplified.  There was a sauce on them, which I would have happily drunk with a straw! (duck magret & chicken, fog jam, green onion, garlic whip)Overall, one of my favorite things to do is to eat a bunch of different types of food - I really enjoy eating tapas style.  Because of this, there was little of the menu which we didn't get to sample.  Solid experience, great food, and really fun atmosphere!",14,6,12,Robin G.,"Princeton, NJ",1226,381,2328

3.0,2/4/2018,"My friends and I decided to check out ilili during Restaurant Week last week. I love mediterranean food, so I was really looking forward to some of the items they had on the menu. We had a reservation and were seated right away. Walking through the restaurant was quite an experience-- there were mirrors everywhere, so the place looks a lot bigger than it probably is. The decor was awesome! When we were seated, we were greeted by our server given the menu. Our waiter was awesome. He was outgoing, funny and helpful with any questions we asked. I told him that I couldn't eat any dairy and he walked through each and every Restaurant Week menu item, telling me if it had dairy or if it could be made without it. When it came to the dessert options, he realized that each option was no good, so he actually had the kitchen make sorbet special for me! I wish I got out waiter's name because he was really patient in explaining all my options. Instead of the typical one appetizer, one main, and one dessert, ilili lets you order two appetizers off the Restaurant Week menu. So I ordered the Mouhamara, and Moussaka. I've had Moussaka before, but I'd never heard of Mouhamara so I figured it would be a good time to try it out. When they came out, they were not really what I expected-- the Moussaka was basically just cold chunks of eggplant with some other vegetables and seasonings. Usually, I equate Moussaka to a mediterranean lasagna but this version didn't have any layers, and didn't appear to be baked since it was served cold. That being said, I still really enjoyed both appetizers. Just as we were about finished with the apps, they put out the main course. This was a little confusing though, because they hadn't yet removed the appetizer plates.  For my entree, I ordered the Lamb Makloubeh (which I still can't pronounce), and it was very good. The chunks of lamb almost melted in your mouth, although the pieces were pretty big and hard to cut with my knife. In addition to the lamb, the dish had ""dirty rice"" and fried eggplant. Not sure what made this rice ""dirty,"" but I was a fan. Finally, this dish came with a cup of yogurt that you were supposed to stir into the lamb to mix it all together (""Sort of like oatmeal,"" my waiter told us). I didn't eat the yogurt with my dish, but I suppose it would have enhanced the dish. By the time the desserts came out, I was honestly stuffed. At first, the idea of getting two appetizers sounded great but in hindsight, it was so much food. I don't think I completely finished any one course that came out. Like I mentioned before, my waiter was kind enough to arrange a dairy-free dessert option for me which ended up being three scoops of sorbet: pear ginger, apple fennel, and raspberry pomegranate, I believe. This sorbet was really delicious. The only downside was that upon taking my first spoonful, I found a huge green piece of dried food stuck to the underside of the spoon. Disgusting. When I told our waiter, he apologized profusely and took the spoon and the sorbet back to get me new ones. The only problem is that I'm pretty sure they forgot about me. I probably waited about 15 minutes for the new sorbet to come out. I realize they did me a favor by giving me an option that wasn't on the restaurant week menu, but waiting for 15 minutes was unacceptable, especially after discovering a dirty spoon in my mouth. I appreciated how surprised and apologetic he was, but he really made us wait too long. All in all, I'm happy I came here to experience some new dishes, but the dirty spoon was a major turn-off.",0,0,0,Victoria A.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",1,37,42

Our waiter popped over to explain the RW process and get our drinks. For the meal, I had the falafel and cauliflower to start, gnocchi for the entree, and candy bar for dessert. The best part for me was the candy bar. The rest, sadly looked better than it tasted. The two appetizers were very heavy and the entree was overpowered with the taste of tomato, not to mention the gnocchi was breaded, which I was not expecting. The meal was also timed poorly. They brought out the entrees while we were still eating our appetizers, but we waited what felt like 30 mins between the entree and dessert. Then they brought my friend a dirty spoon, which she started to eat her dessert with. Once she noticed and called the waiter over, he brought her a new dessert, but we waited another 10-15 mins for that to come. Ambiance was interesting. It has a clubby vibe to it. When we first got there it was quieter, but as the night when on the music was turned up and the volume around us got pretty loud too. You are seated very close to everyone around you, we often had to yell at our waiter for him to hear us. On that note, the service was the only reason this place didn't lose more stars.

Neither me nor my friend finished any one plate, and we actually took the main home for leftovers! Two full-size appetizers each, one main, and one dessert. We were stuffed!Appetizers were 8/10. We loved the hummus; very light and fresh, with an assortment of toppings to choose from. The jalapenos were cut into massive pieces and thrown on top, though. Too much for our taste. We tried the moussaka and both loved it; IMO the best appetizer. I ordered the steak tartare and am disgusted thinking about it! It tasted like room-temp insides of a sausage. An uncooked, room-temp, blended sausage. It was awful! The massive jalapenos from the hummus made an appearance on this dish as well, accompanied by blunt-cut white onion chunks. Neither made the meat tolerable. I felt sick just looking at it. Luckily, the main course redeemed the meal. I ordered the Lamb Makloubeh and absolutely loved every bite! The lamb was perfectly seasoned, and sliced in a way, yet tender enough to pull with a fork, that it touched every bite. Dirty rice? I don't care why it's brown, it's delicious. Best rice, lamb, and sauce I've had - separately and together - and that's saying a lot as I'm Greek. Excellent use of toasted pistachios and macadamia nuts. By dessert, we were SO full, but ordered the panna cotta and Knafe Bil Jibneh. I absolutely loved the panna cotta; light and flavorful, topped with the freshest grapefruit and pomegranate seeds. The Knafe was very unusual. It took 20 minutes to prepare, and tasted like a sweet baked cheese (not overpowering, almost like the texture of baked mozzarella with the flavor of paneer), but coated in cinnamon sugar! All together, it tasted like cinnamon toast crunch and mozzarella sticks - weird, I know, but worth a taste for those of you tired of the standard creme brulee and chocolate bomb after dinner.",2,0,0,Courtney C.,"New York, NY",377,115,47
4.0,1/23/2018,"I came here to ring in the start of Restaurant Week with my best friend. The aesthetics of the restaurant are definitely its selling point. Super high ceilings, mirrored walls and even the bathrooms are pleasing to look at. Our service and hostess were really great. I'm vegan and she catered to that really well by substituting the lack of vegan deserts with a scoop of sorbet. The sorbet was amazing. As far as the food, it was good but as other reviews mentioned, not spectacular. I took off just one star for the fact that our waitress did not mention the upcharge for my friends dessert and market sandwich. It was no big deal as $100 for two people at an upscale restaurant is really reasonable; it was just something that couldn't been reiterated if we missed it on the menu.

2.0,1/19/2018,"The food is excellent; you'll get no argument from me on this point. But while our waiter last night was friendly and prompt, the general management of the restaurant is sorely lacking. I made a reservation (for two) with the note that this was for a birthday, and I had hoped that fact would be acknowledged and we would be seated in the main dining room or somewhere nice, maybe even romantic? Instead, we were seated in a room that had a decidedly corporate feel, very bland, with a low ceiling and poor lighting, and certainly none of the charm of the main part of the restaurant. Also, we were squished between two sets of other diners. The energy was off, so I asked to be moved, but the new arrangement was only marginally better, and the woman who sat us wasn't too friendly (either time). When we sat, I noticed that more of the table setting was dirty than clean; my fork had something on it, so I requested another one. My napkin had dirt on it, but I wiped it off. My date's glass was dirty and therefore never drunk from. At one point the room divider thing we were next to was knocked over by a staff member and it fell on top of me. In some places you'd get a free drink or something but in this place, I wasn't even offered an apology. The wall was lifted back into place with nary a word.

These were just...bad. we also ordered the babaghannouj, hummus, beef tartare, cauliflower and manti. The hummus was ok, babaghanouj was very lemony, the beef tartare was really gross. We adore beef tartare!!! This was the largest portion of tasteless raw meat. My boyfriend said ""it's like they went to the grocery and just slapped some ground beef on the plate"". It was a rectangular prism about 7 inches long, and an inch wide. With some 2 inch raw onion chunks and slices of jalapeno with it. The tartare meat was totally tasteless. The cauliflower dish, hummus, and manti (lamb dish) were edible but really not good (especiallyfor that price).

4.0,1/5/2018,"I was looking for a vegetarian friendly restaurant for a group of 5 friends to meet in Midtown East and stumbled upon Illili on Yelp. Firsly- the price estimates on the Yelp menu are not accurate. The restaurant is actually more expensive. I wish I had known that before, definitely would have chosen a cheaper restaurant. It ended up being $70 a person which was more than double what I wanted to pay for a casual night out with friends. Fortunately, while the price wasn't to my liking, at least the food was delicious. BEST FRIES. Omg the fries are amazing! It's the morning after and I'm dreaming about going back just for another bucket of fries. They were thick cubed fries that had a thin crunchy layer flaked with spices and garlic. When you bit into it the crunchy layer gave way to soft potates that just melted in your mouth. All of the appetizers we ordered were delicious except for the falafael which was dry and didn't have much flavor.

4.0,12/31/2017,"Being born and raised in Lebanon, I would have to disagree with most of the reviews here. Ilili maybe the most famous Lebanese restaurants in NYC. However, it is definitely not your typical traditional Lebanese experience and it is by no means reflective of the true spirit of authentic, simple, home style, generous Lebanese cuisine. It's obviously an upscale, fancy, sophisticated, New York style Americanized lebanese restaurant. It is more suited for big occasions. Portions are so small. High prices.There are many other options in the city for more authentic and affordable delicious Lebanese food such as Naya and balade. I still gave it 4 stars because food is still tasty and of excellent quality (still not authentic), service is so attentive, professional, and friendly. Servers are American but they're very familiar with Lebanese food, cook style and our wine, which they have a great selection of by the way and is a big bonus. The knefe is in my opinion their best signature! Probably the best in NYCWonderful atmosphere. New York chic, vibrant, high ceilings, classy crowd.

All the plates are pretty small and they recommend 2-4 per person, which seems about right depending on how hungry you are. I love the ambiance, and the service was on point, but I felt it was a tiny bit intrusive, but I like to be left alone when I eat. The food: Cold mezze :Baba ghannouj was very creamy and subtle in flavor. Hummus was good, also very creamy and smooth. I love the labne, very tangy and rich, and finally the tabbouleh was amazing, I love the slight onion flavor but glad it wasn't overpowering. All the cold and warm dips are served as seperate courses with bread, which was warm and amazing. Hot mezze:Warm eggplant seemed to be fried then cooked again, I would skip this, it was very one dimensional in flavor, a subtle sweet sauce. The brussels sprouts were interesting, served with grapes and walnuts, not sure I loved it because it was such an unusual combination. The phoenician fries were amazing, coming with a creamy garlic dip. My favorite of the night were the manti, they were so flavorful and came in such a yummy tomato yogurt dip. Finally, the beef shawarma was a bit bland, I wouldn't recommend this. Mains:We had the braised short ribs, seemed to be quite small portion for the price and slightly fatty.

Where do I begin...To clarify we all know Steak Tartae is French but iLiLi put an excellent Middle Eastern twist on this dish called Kibbeh Naye Beirutieh with crudités of onions, jalapeno and mint. Awesome do try this!Baba Ghannouj one of the best creamy eggplant & tahini cold Mezzas I've had to date with a wonderful roasted smoky flavor to tantalize the palate and awaken your senses. Get it.Hommus with Basterma out of this world wonderful, you might want to order a few of these with Jalapeno to kick it up a notch, say yes!Batata Harra perfectly cooked tender cubed potatoes, kouzbara, aleppo pepper, drizzle some olive oil all over and you can thank me later, your welcome.Phoenician Fries with sumac, parsley, garlic whip if you love dipping crispy on the outside, soft on the inside delicately seasoned fries in out of this world garlicky creamy dip make this an order to try for sure, you shall not be disappointed.Atayef & House Cured Veal Bacon perfect balance of Fig jam, pickles and hot peppers, the veal bacon just makes this a wow factor.Both the Duck & Beef Shawarma were tender, juicy, mouth watering delights full throttle umami sensations to try all wrapped in warm fresh pita.Citrus Trout absolutely wonderful delicate fish with orange tahini, arugula, and smoked almonds, flavor, texture and crunch delivers in spades!

Years later I finally made it here during restaurant week with a friend but she insisted that ordering from the regular menu would be cheaper (I didn't want to argue, but of course it wasn't). While I've definitely enjoyed this experience, I remember the one from nearly a month ago much better.This time I came here for my best friend's birthday. She had this restaurant on her very own list and I was ready to give it another try.We had a reservation for a late dinner because of my Friday evening class (so happy that's over with). Once we got there we were seated right away. You have the option of hanging your coat but we decided to take ours with us. The space is absolutely huge, definitely one of the largest restaurants I've been to in NYC. When you enter, you go through a lounge-like area into a main room, where I've eaten previously. This time we were taken to the back room, which is slightly less nice but is definitely smaller and somewhat more intimate.As most diners who frequent this establishment, we decided to split several appetizers. We went with the Labne (strained yogurt, olive oil, fresh mint and zaatar), Handrolled Warak Enab (grape leaves, rice, tomato, tomato oil and parsley oil) Falafel, (friend chickpea & fava bean croquettes), Phoenician Fries (sumac, parsley and garlic whip), and Moujadra Croquettes (green lentil, caramelized onion, turmeric and yogurt on the side). I've also had a glass of Raventos i Blanc Cava 2014 while my friend had the La Caravelle Brut Rosé NV, both were quite good and went well with our meal. The Moujadra croquettes were the least memorable ones and I can't stay I've enjoyed the dish very much. What probably stood out the most are the Phoenician Fries which although had only slightly different ingredients than other fries I've previously had, still made quite an impression. The Labne and Falafel were both good, the handrolled warak enab was pretty good considering I was never really a fan of grape leaves. As if we didn't have enough of an unhealthy dinner (we just happened to choose the most fried options out there), we also ordered the ilili Candy Bar (dark chocolate ganache, fig caramel, dulche de leche ice cream, salted pistachio) for dessert. It was an absolutely delicious mix of flavors and we both truly loved it. The service was pretty attentive, professional yet not condescending. Once we were done eating, we were not bothered and actually had a difficult time getting their attention once we were ready to leave.All in all, this was a good experience. However, considering how most appetizers are the price of an entree at many other equally good places (which would explain our ridiculous bill at the end of the night), I am starting to reconsider my affinity for tapas-like places in general.

Made a reservation for 6pm. Got there and was seated promptly. The hostess was nice. That's where it went downhill. The server was incredibly inattentive. Most of the servers were hanging out chatting rather than paying attention to their tables. We had to flag down our server 11 times throughout the meal including to ask to get our dirty plates cleared. We ordered 4 appetizers. Falafel, beef shawarma, mouhamara, and the Brussels sprouts. The sprouts were ok but the rest was awful. Flavorless and dry food. We ordered 2 drinks. A passion fruit one - which my partner said was delicious and a Lebanese American which tasted like the sidewalk. 2 drinks and 4 appetizers came to $140 with tip. Even though the service was so bad that I felt a tip wasn't needed. Other stuff included dirty restrooms and just really bad acoustics to the point where you couldn't hear the music or the person sitting across from you.

5.0,11/12/2017,Went there for a dinner at the behest of a friend who loves Lebanese food and who is quite a foodie.  We were a party of 5 and were Seated at a round table which was my preference as we had some items to discuss.The service was a good indicator in terms of the upscale nature of this place. The waiter was extremely knowledgeable and was able to help us navigate through the menu and the wine listThe appetizers consisted of a series of small plates for sharing and accompanied by a series of small side plates which are accented the flavors of the dishes themselves. The picture that I have attached shows the seven dishes that formed the entrée. From Hummus to lamb to greens nothing was less than exceptional.  The waiter recommended a bottle of Bordeaux style Lebanese wine which was the perfect accompaniment to a terrific meal. As an aside my friend has found this wine and has given it to me as a gift.Overall it was one of the best Middle Eastern cuisine dining experiences in New York City. I will be backPS.  The waiter Alex was terrific and made this an even more fun and memorable experience,1,0,0,Marios D.,"Manhattan, NY",196,509,827

4.0,10/27/2017,"My family is Lebanese and a couple of times a year, we rent the upstairs room for a large group and order meza style, and we have probably tasted the vast majority of items on the menu. The food is very good and the presentation of each dish is also unique.  During our parties, the service is very good and there always seems to be a sort of ""head"" server, who is always very attentive and professional.  During most most recent visit, 2 weeks ago, a blonde female was in that role... and of all our visits, she stood out to me because she was more friendly and personable whereas in the past, although attentive, the person in that role has sometimes felt a bit more ""stuffy."" I personally found that this most recent worker increased my overall experience.  The primary reason I cannot rate this a 5 is that during one party there about a year ago, they made a pretty major goof (won't get into it but jist is they accidentally didnt serve a handful of the dishes we ordered). However, when it was brought to their attention, they did everything they could to rectify it. Accidents happen!  Nonetheless, we have continued to return to this venue.  I'd also like to mention that the physical space and environment is very nice - it's  a nice combination of modern and elegant.  You definitely feel like you're in an upscale place which we usually want when entertaining a party.  We usually have two kids and/or toddlers who tend to wander around the space and play a bit.  Maybe it's bc the space is reserved for us but having them play has never been an issue and if anything, workers have tended to sort of appreciate how cute they are! Food:  some of what stands out to me that are worth mentioning are.... pre-food, they offer virgin mocktails that are simple yet unique- I luvvvvv the cucumber lemonade drink and I'd luv to copy it at home but just can't get it right! Also, for dessert, the knafeh is the best I've had anywhere, and I couldn't help but order one to bring home. I personally have not tried it, (for personal reasons/preferences), but everyone who is ok with and adventurous enough to eat the kibby nayeh (raw kibby) which is afterall a pretty traditional dish, my family members have raved about it/the kibby nayeh. Also, the fries (not American fries) are so well seasoned and tasty and remind me of how my grandma in Lebanon would make them - it of course comes with the garlic whip to dip them in.  For vegetarians, there are of course plenty of meat-free options (i.e. hummus, grape leaves, tabbuleh , falafel, baba ganoush, tzatziki).  The pita which is basic generally speaking - they have the best pita I've ever had.  They come out warm and the bread itself is a bit thin, in a good way.

Brought my girlfriend here for her 22nd birthday as a late lunch. Place is beautiful upon arrival. Even the waiting room. For appetizer we had the hummus & pita which turned out to be a different texture Shared the mixed grill. A Lebanese dish of various meats & ordered the Brussels sprouts to go with it as suggested by my waiter. Food was delicious.. the whipped garlic sauces that come with the mixed grill compliment the food immensely! The mixture of flavors and cultural seasonings were great. Didn't bother ordering drinks despite the occasion because the food left us so full but we made space for the mousse cheesecake which was once again delicious.. Will return for sure!

The downside is that the more affordable plates are appetizers and the main dishes are 3x as expensive. But we got 4 appetizers to share and were really full. My favorite were the fries and duck shawarma (basic, I know); there's definitely a Lebanese twist though that you won't find anywhere else.A must try for drinks is Arak.

1.0,10/13/2017,"From 5 star to 1 starMy last review for this place was 5 star. Today's experience says these guys are getting a little too overconfident and don't care a bit about their customers.I took my aging parents promising them a nice dinner. After we were seated, it took almost 20-25 minutes for anyone to say hello and to ask if we are ready to order.  To their defense it was busy, but it doesn't give them an excuse to ignore a party for 20-25 minutes.We ordered six dishes. The first three arrive in about 10-15 minutes. We got working on them while we waited for the rest of the food. These were small portions and we were done in 10-15 minutes at best.We waited a good 30 minutes after that. So overall 45 minutes had passed. Any decent waiter would check to ensure that something is not missed. No waiter showed any apologies or level of urgency or made an eye contact to ensure we were served. I finally waived to the waiter out of frustration. He said he will check. His demeanor was not one of apology. They were winging it. I was still being very polite. The manager finally brought the food after another 15 minutes and claimed they had dropped our food and they prepared it fresh. Mind it, it's almost an hour since we received our first set of food. The ""fresh"" food was cold, out of a refrigerator. The manager (the bald guy who looked like the hitman from Breaking Bad) was lying. Two minutes later the waiter walked over and said the kitchen was busy. Not really, because I saw 10 other tables served who came well after us. I honestly didn't want to pay a single penny for my meal and for the lies. They reduced our bill by $50. I still tipped well and walked away. Looking back, I am very angry that I paid anything at all. They ruined my meal and More Importantly - ruined my parents night out. We packed the food that arrived late because we had lost our appetite after such a long wait.  Ilili, you make good food. But your $50 reduction in my bill didn't make my night any better. You ruined it. And there was no need for your employees to lie that they prepared the food fresh when they didn't. It was pretty clear the food was forgotten and was sitting somewhere in the kitchen and no one cared. And how caring after realizing that someone had screwed up and bringing cold food to the table. Your apology doesn't mean anything if your employees are still lying. SHAME ON ALL OF YOU. I hope you all are served in the same manner when you take your parents out for a meal.And by the way WTF was that cauliflower dish with three small florets of cauliflower.

Fattoush salad was ordinary. Truthfully, I have had better in a food court. Next came the big offender - duck shawarma. Tastless and dry. That is because ""the duck"" was mostly shredded chicken mixed in. When we complained to the waiter, he originally did nothing. When pressed he said he would send the manager out. Manager said he could have the kitchen make another order and add more sauce! We declined and he did comp us. Then dessert. We ordered strawberry rhubarb shortcake. Which did not contain shortcake. Rather crumbled cookies which had an unpleasant aftertaste. When we mentioned to the waiter, got another shrug but he did send the manager out. Shortcake is an iconic American dessert. Manager said it was their spin on it. But he did comp us. Even with the shawarma and the dessert off the bill, it was still $70 for two small appetizers, one glass of wine and two coffees.

1.0,8/26/2017,"Had a friend get-together dinner there one Friday night and ordered from the restaurant week menu. The food is decent but the drink is very pricey. I paid for the whole meal and I didn't really checked the bill at the time since I was in conversations with friends. But after I got home, I realized that I got overcharged. From the receipt, I saw a couple of items that doesn't sound familiar but added to the bill. I tried to contact the restaurant but was asked to wait for the manager to contact me since the manager happened to not be around at the time. And the manager never reached out~I wrote a OpenTable message to the restaurant and finally somebody reached out to me. He said he is the manager and wanted to help me resolve the issue.(which he never did) Turns out they added a bottle of water ($8!!!) to my bill which i never ordered and specially asked for tap water,a lot of surcharges to the RW menu and charged extra for the grey goose ($2 each to the already expensive drinks) which the waitress never mentioned about any surcharge. After a couple of back and forth with the manager, he still couldn't refund the overcharged part and said he would send gift card so that he could show me a better experience at ilili. And he never sent anything. The whole experience is terrible and shows that the restaurant is very irresponsible and can't live up to their words. Very over priced and a lot of hidden charges to trick the customers. Please avoid this place at all cost.",3,0,0,Nat Z.,"Manhattan, NY",1,7,0

4.0,8/22/2017,Make sure to make reservations!! Its packed even on a random weekday lunch. Me and a girlfriend wanted to try it out for restaurant week after she dined here previously and raved about it. We made reservations for 2 at 12pm and i was surprised once we got there it was pretty full for the time they just opened. For the appetizers we decided on:Chankleesh- it was basically feta in a jar. Dont get me wrong it tasted good but for $15 i can probably get a block of feta and stacks of pita to go with it. Grape leaves- these were delicious. I've always been hesitant to try grape leaves because they look hard to eat but the leaf itself is actually super tender and doesnt take away from the filling of rice and tomatoes. Phonecian fries- also worth getting. They're perfectly seasoned and meaty and everything a fry should be. For the main course we decided on:Veal BLT- ive never had veal before but it was cooked very well and did not overwhelm the bread of the sandwich with its texture either. I enjoyed this alot more than the sandwich i ordered which was super soggy and hard to eat. Cubano- kind of disappointed on how pancake like the bread was. Picking it up was greasy and difficult to keep the filling inside and I couldn't really taste much flavor profile because the soggy bread skeeved me out after a couple bites. For dessert we got:Strawberry rhubarb shortcake & knafe. The shortcake was whatever. More like a parfait and i only noticed the mild rhubarb tartness in the preserves. Knafe was the winner of the entire meal. To have fried cheese for dessert?! My life is complete. The cheese is super delicate in taste and goes well with the orange syrup they pour on top. Definitely a must have if you can come across it in any middle eastern fare restaurant. Ililis ambiance matches its price point. So does the service. I would come back here without relying on restaurant week but only for special occasions. I can find this kind of food in queens but the aesthetic wont be as pretty,2,1,0,Carolyn Z.,"Flushing, NY",408,268,510
4.0,8/21/2017,"A group of us decided to end nyc restaurant week at ilili because the 3 course menu had a variety of food to choose from. What was nice about the 3 course menu was that we could chose 2 appetizers!! A rarity in nyc!My girlfriend and I got to ilili before our husband's so we decided to get a drink in ilili's lobby. The lobby is pretty spacious and would be a nice spot to grab drinks. Luckily it was happy hour on the speciality drinks (still kinda pricey  for a 'special' at $10 a drink), we both got the passion fruit cocktail. The cocktail was too sweet and tasted like syrup. We asked the bar tender for seltzer water to dilute the cocktail. After being diluted, the cocktail tasted a lot better. Such a shame to dilute the alcohol, after paying $10 for the drink!!!Once our husband's came we were seated right away, since we have a reservation. I highly recommend getting a reservation to this restaurant since it gets packed quick!When we were seated we were informed that happy hour was at the bar only. The wait staff or bartender should have told us this policy so we could have taken advantage of the cheaper prices 10 feet away. This turned me off a bit, but I still continued to look forward to the meal. After our husband's drinks arrived, my husband noticed his beer glass was chipped after having a sip of beer. Make sure you check the rims of the glasses before taking a drink!! The waiter quickly replaced my husband's glass with no questions asked.I chose the hummus and falafel as my 2 appetizers. I expected a small plate of hummus and 2 falafels. To my surprise I received a pretty sizeable plate for the hummus and 4 falafels. The falafels were squares!!! I never saw falafels in this shape before, so I had to take a picture. The hummus had too much olive oil, which overpowered the taste of the hummus. Falafels were well seasoned and not to dry, probably one of the best falafels that  I ever had! Note: ilili is extremely generous with the pita bread. The bread is fresh and warm!  For my entree, I got the lemon and garlic chicken which was very juicy and well seasoned. I liked how the chicken wasn't over grilled and didn't taste like charcoal. The dessert was a bit disappointing, I got a strawberry rhubarb shortcake which was very bitter. I couldn't finish it :(Overall, ilili is a nice spot. The food is pretty good for the most part. Portions are big, we all had leftovers for lunch the next day. The only downside was that the service was pretty slow. Our dinner lasted almost 3 hours, which was great for all of us to catch up, but there was long periods of time between each course.",0,0,0,Danielle C.,"New York, NY",2,33,39

I was right about the first part - it's a large space and the staff are pretty accommodating with reservations - I had to make a few changes to my party size and they were super flexible. However, that's really the only thing this place has going for it. The service was TERRIBLE, instructions we had given to our hostess in advance were not passed on to our server. The service was super slow, we waited for over an hour for our entree's to arrive after we'd had our appetizers. And once the food did arrive, it was really disappointing. Poached eggs were over cooked to the point that they had the consistency of hard-boiled eggs - insane! I had the Manouche which was really boring.

I wouldn't reccommend the steak tartar as it reminded me of cat food no joke (no taste at all and an odd texture). Chicken for dinner was so tasty I almost wished there was more on my plate. With the restaurant week prices, it wasn't so bad! They lost a star with me because their drink menu was quite expensive (20+ for a glass of champagne?

The food is amazing when you order the right things ... everything with lamb is amazing.  The apps ... cauliflower, lamb meatballs, labne, brussel sprouts and fluke are crazy good.

4.0,8/16/2017,"Extremely spacious, fine-dining restaurant known for it's creative Lebanese dishes. Given the number of lip-smacking vegetarian dishes that hard-core non-vegetarians like me can't help but admire, I would call this place a ""Disney Land"" for vegetarians, at-least it is for my pure vegetarian mom and mom-in-law! That makes it atleast one place, right there, for them to get along ;)  Although their entrees are great too, we usually stick to small plates and order 8 or 9 of different small plates for 2 of us and more for bigger groups. Yes! The small plates and unlimited pita fills you up and you get to try out their plethora of options without filling yourself up with 1 huge entree. My standard order looks like this:From the COLD MEZZA section:Hummus:  Plain and one with jalapenoMouhamara:  Delicious dip made with nuts and red peppersBaba Ganoush: Cooked, smashed, egg plant with seasoningLabne: Yogurt with olive oil and fresh mintTabbouleh: Made of parsley, mint, tomato, onionFrom the HOT MEZZA section:Falafel: Fried balls of spiced mashed chickpeas Brussels Sprouts: with grapes, jam, walnuts, mint yogurt. Beware, this is slightly sweet, thanks to the jam.Batata Harra: The second best dish on the menu - made of cubed potatoes and spicesBlack Iron Shrimp: The BEST dish on the menu. Beware of the hot cast iron pan though!Desserts:Ashta: Clotted cream, rose water syrup and fruit. Great!Date Souffle: Toasted almond and milk sorbet. Good.Strawberry Rhubarb Shortcake: labne with strawberries. Just ok.Baklava:  Not on the menu, but you can ask for it and they always have it.I never get past the small plates - they are that filling!  The dress code at Ilili is business casual, but we have been welcomed warmly every time we turned up in casuals with family.Restaurant week fans, if you have kids with you, they cannot share food from your 3-course order, they have to order all 3 courses for themselves too!  You are better off ordering a la carte.",3,2,2,Rashmi J.,"San Carlos, CA",686,109,709

Along with the food instead of the regular wine we ordered the Arak. Tried 2 different ones. The one the server said would be too strong is the one we liked. The flavor on the other was too much for my taste. We also ordered the cheese rolls and the lamb dunplings which was basically lamb in gravy. Again, very delicious. Our server was courteous and knowledgeable. It is on the pricier side and decor was kind of different. Not sure nice different.

It really wasn't anything special and seemed to be just yogurt with oil. This was hugely disappointing especially if you've tried the one at Cleo. The fries and the dip however were really good. My falafel entree was the worst I've ever had. The falafel was dry and hard and had no taste. I've had better falafel just about everywhere! The salmon entree was really good however.

All of them were great and the portion was more than enough. I liked how after we finished those appetizers and after the entrees, we weren't rushed and given the next dish. Our waiter basically gave us time to digest before serving us the next dish. For entrees, my boyfriend got the diver scallops and I got the Scottish salmon. My boyfriend liked his dish, but the salmon was definitely better. The skin was crispy and the fish was medium rare, which was cooked to perfection. The dessert part of the dinner was even better. We were recommended to get knafeh bil jibneh. It was a savory/sweet kind of dessert and even though it seems kind of weird that it was a three cheese blend in the dessert, it was sooo good.

5.0,8/7/2017,"I went to ilili this last Monday for restaurant week, I read so many positive reviews and the menu looked amazing, I had to try it! I made a reservation for 6 PM, I arrived 15 minutes prior to my res and was seated promptly, it was not crowded at all. It's very large it has a bar/waiting area decorated with plants, low cushion seating and coffee tables right when you walk in, off to the left is two large seating areas that can accommodate large groups and couples, ilili gives off a very chill and sultry vibe. ilili had one of the larger restaurant week menus there were about 5 to 6 options in both the app and entree section and 3 in the desert; you were able to choose 2 apps, 1 entree, and a dessert. As soon as my boyfriend and I sat down we were greeted by our lovely and knowledgeable waitress, she explained the rules of restaurant week, both of us had to participate to receive the deal; $42 prefixed menu not including tax/tip. We started off with cocktails, not apart of the restaurant week, but we can't go anywhere and not have one. The bf got From Beirut with Passion ($16) basil cilantro mint infused vodka, sparkling passion fruit, and I had Lebanese Oasis ($15) bourbon, lime. Both drinks were delish and strong enough to slurp right down. I also tried massaya arak which is like Lebanese liquorish, I was not fan, if like liquorish I'm sure you will be. Now onto the food! For apps we got: burrata (tomato, beet, zaatar), jalapeño hummus w/ pita bread, falafel (fried chickpea & fava bean dumplings), and Kibbeh Naye Beirutieh (steak tartare, burghul, onion, mint). Dinner I had the Diver Scallops (peas, asparagus, carrots, radish, lemon) and the bf had Chicken Shish Taouk (chicken breast, garlic, lemon), and finally for dessert, ilili Candy Bar and Strawberry Rhubarb Shortcake. I don't have a negative thing to say about anything nor did my boyfriend we both loved it! The hummus was creamy and silky and not overly spiced, the jalapenos gave it a nice kick, the pita was came out fluffy and hot. The burrata was great not one of the best I've had but it was delish no the less, oozing with cream. The falafel good but was my least fav, it was not as easy to cut through as I thought the outer shell was hard and you had to use a little bit of umph to cut through, the flavorss were good, I was able to taste both beans evenly, I did find it a tad dry, but that's why we got hummus, I dipped it right in for added flavor! The steak tartare was exactly as you'd expect, the meat was excellent but not for the faint of heart, some people aren't into raw meat, but everyone should try it once, it's delish. I didn't get a chance to sample the chicken, but there were no complaints only rave reviews as it was cooked to perfections and seasoned evenly and just the right amount of lemon, I was told. The scallops were excellent, I think they were the best I've ever had, smooth like butter, they practically melted in my mouth! They were so evenly cooked, which most restaurants/people have a hard time doing, and the veggies at the bottom completed the dish very well, grilled and seasoned with lemon,I love my veggies cooked with lemon so I thoroughly enjoyed them.

5.0,7/31/2017,"Ilili is an absolute gem. For a while it had 3.5 stars which is just highway robbery. Its absolutely worthy of a terrific review. Since moving to NYC 3.5 years ago I've been here easily 15 times. Its me and my girlfriends go to spot when we have people in town visiting. Because of its significant capacity its relatively easy to get a reservation. But at the same time its large seating capacity does not at all detract from the quality or the experience. The play is to get small plates. Period. I'd recommend 2-3 per person. And I'm a big guy with a big appetite.You can't go wrong here. Everything is calculated and fine tuned and absolutely delicious. My top picks after many visits...Humus with jalapeno - smooth, velvety, and that jalapeno kickLebne - rich and delicious, one of my favoritesFattoush - well balanced salad, very good, with some pita chips cracked inThyme salad - spicy and herbaceous Duck shawarma - I'm in loveLamb meatballs - nice and tender with this great somewhat sweet sauceMeat dumplings - these are awesome, with a tomato yogurty sauceFeta spread (can't remember the real name) - salty and chunky, really like this stuffFalafel - not dry like most places is, its nice and moist with a crunchy crispy shell, and its square?!? Maybe tays the secret to the perfect textureAnd loads and loads of the pillowy soft pitaThe cocktail selections are always solid. Super fresh ingredients and very unique concoctions. Best way to go is to start your visit off with a cocktail at the low tables in the entrance area then move to the table. Wine selection is great. Lots of lebanese wines alongside the more traditional french italian and american styles. My ultimate piece of advice here...trust your waiter. Th people who work here know there stuff. They know what's good. They know how to read your tastes. They won't steer your wrong. If you're a first time diner or just want to branch out from the norm ask them for advice. They are a resource to be taken advantage of. So if you wanna know just ask for some ordering tips. Believe me.I'll be returning to ilili regularly until I leave the city whenever that may be.

3.0,7/31/2017,"I scheduled ILILI for a group of 6 at peak New York dinner hours.  I found the ambiance to be a bit bizarre in a cool way, from the lighting to the feel of the dining room.  The service was very haphazard as we waited about 10 minutes for the wine we ordered to arrive.  Our appetizers also came out randomly and incorrectly.  That being said, every single mezze we had was absolutely fantastic.  Brussel sprouts with grapes, chicken liver pate, hummus with crispy beef, and falafel were all tremendously well done.  The restaurant week menu was $42 and came with 2 mezze, one entree, and one dessert.  This was a great deal, but the problem was that you were full after the appetizers (6 people meant 12 appetizers) and the main dishes were underwhelming in comparison to the mezze. Overall, this was a solid meal but not the exact experience we were looking for.  I think it's important to feel out the table and what they want, and we did not necessarily want a nearly 3 hour meal with weird spacing on this night.",0,0,0,Parker M.,"Bronxville, NY",244,18,38

4.0,7/10/2017,"We came to ilili based on a recommendation from a friend. I also saw that they had pretty good reviews on yelp and wanted to give it a try. We booked reservation for Saturday at 5:30pm, a little early for dinner but we wanted to stay away from the crowds. When we got there the place was still relatively empty and got seated 5 minutes upon being greeted.The decor inside ilili reminds me of a sleek and modern 5th ave restaurant. It was minimalist but had enough just to please the eyes. They have a wide range of seating options from the bar, large booths, or dinner tables towards the back which we sat at.The menu offers a wide range of Mediterranean options ranging from hummus plates, assortment of meats, seafood, shawarma, and more. My girlfriend and I decided on a few appetizers and 1 main to share. We just got back from Paris so when we saw that they had chicken liver we got super excited. For the appetizers we decided on the Chicken Liver Mousse, Hummus, and Duck Shawarma. For the main we went with the Mixed Grill for 2.Hummus- The hummus was super good! The hummus itself tasted very typical and usual but the pita bread is what stole the show. The pita tasted homemade and fresh baked and it was still very hot. It was perfectly fluffy and delicious! Chicken Liver Mousse- This was by far my favorite dish!! It reminded me of the liver in Paris but the mousse version gives it a different taste. It does have a strong liver taste but I personally enjoy it very much. Combine this with some of the left over pita from the hummus is really a taste of heaven!Duck Shawarma- This is my second favorite item of the meal! The garlic whip combined with the duck gives it an amazing taste. My only issue with this dish is that at $21 for two tiny shawarma, it is very pricey. I would still recommend this dish however as it is very good.Mixed Grill for 2- This dish was okay overall. It is pretty much a sampler of all the meat items they have. A few of the meat items like chicken and lamb were tasty but the rest was okay. They provided several dipping sauces but compared to the other dishes it was okay. For the price of $68 I wished I got something else. This was definitely not worth it.Overall, I had a pretty good experience at ilili. A majority of the food was really good but could be pricey for what it is. My only negative feedback would be that the service is very slow. The staff did a good job of checking on us but it took forever for any food to come out. I would definitely be back but would try a different main course this time around.",0,0,0,Peter L.,"Jersey City, NJ",215,124,174

Service was prompt and friendly, atmosphere was classy, excellent interior design here. As far as the food, flavorful, and decent portions (not huge though).

3.0,6/22/2017,"Came here for Restaurant week back in the winter.The restaurant week menu was very large, and had so many great options.Food: The restaurant week menu came as a prix fix menu and you were able to pick 2 appetizers, an entree and a dessert. The falafel was delicious, a little dry, but when it was dipped into the sauce it came with it was out of this world. The hummus tasted like any other hummus, so I was not very impressed. The Fattoush was ok, I was overwhelmed with the amount of pita chips on it, if there were less pita chips, I think it would've been so much better. We both got the lamb, that was extra on the menu, and it was one of the best pieces of lamb I had in a while.Atmosphere: Very dark and loud. The tables were far too close to each other so you could hear everyones conversations from around you. Not a fan.Service: Our waiter simply acted like he did not want to be there.

Falafel (fried chickpea & fava bean croquettes) Out of the things we ordered my favorites were the Mekanek and Phoenician fries. The Mekanek had a fresh citrus-y flavor and the lamb was tender and juicy. The Phoenician fries are definitely in the top 3 best fries I've ever had. They were cooked perfectly with a crisp exterior but fluffy and soft interior. The garlic whip was delicious with the fries. The falafel was a bit unconventional to the traditional appearance, and was a bit dry for me. I thought the kebab kerez meatballs were tender, but was on the sweeter note due to the cherry sauce which I didn't enjoy as much.

The octopus which tends to be my favorite appetizer was very very soft and mushy not crisp like it's supposed to be. The hummus was ok but could have used a little more flavor. The little ""spicy"" potato cubes were not spicy at all and had a very fried taste to them.

The hummus, Fattoush salad, Brussels sprouts, and duck shwarma are favorites. However, the service is consistently sub-par and at times, terrible. I've been to this restaurant with friends at least 5 times, and I each time I note how poor the service is. The waiters are inattentive/condescending/slow, and the management staff is likewise condescending and smug. The last time I was there, on 5/24/17, busboys took plates away without asking and before we were done, and the waiter, uncomfortably close, reached across me and my plate while I was eating on several occasions to fill my friend's water. Also at this last visit, as a group of 5 women, we ordered 7 or 8 small plates to share. The dishes came out in waves, which was fine, except that they forgot to give us the last dish we ordered, the kebab kerez. When we realized it, we first alerted the manager, since he was the nearest staff to us at the time. Without saying anything, he rushed away and we saw him at the computer, presumably imputing the forgotten order. When 5-10 minutes had passed, no one had gotten back to us, and all the other food was eaten, the waiter walked by and we mentioned to him that we had not received our final dish. Without apologizing or explaining anything, he also ran over to the computer, presumably to figure out what went wrong.In the end, we got our dish, and it was probably a 4/10. Not something I'll be ordering again. For our inconvenience, they did comp us the last dish, which was the reasonable thing to do.

The tuna tartare was perfect but that's not even something you'd see in most Arabic restaurants...so I didn't count it when rating the Arabic food.

This place can be a little pricy and while I can see why many people love this place, I'd only come here once every so often.Food - Great. They have multiple items on the menu. I tried the hummus, baga ghanoush, mixed grill (multi meat platter), Lamb BLT and Lentil Soup for the two times that I have been here. I'd have to say, go for dinner over lunch if you really want to get the full experience of this restaurant although the lunch menu is very good as well.

3.0,4/8/2017,"Wasn't particularly impressed (especially considering the price tag), but it's a nice trendy restaurant that's good if you're looking for a place for a large group. Probably wouldn't be my top pick next time though because it's a very noisy restaurant, which means you might have to shout so the person across the table can hear you.We got:Brussels Sprouts - This is their most popular dish for a reason. Really great balance of sweet and savory, with perfectly crisp brussels sprouts (cooked to that perfect moment when they're no longer bitter, but sweet).Kibbeh Naye (beef tartare) - SO GOOD. My favorite dish all night. The beef was so smooth and tender and delicious. Yum yum. Octopus - Very good, very tender with just the right bit of crispiness/char on the outside.Hummus - Standard, nothing special.Baba ganouj - Also standard. Wasn't impressed and much prefer the version at Mamoun's.Phoenician Fries - Not a fan of fries and these were no exception.Duck shawarma - Skip this. I had read mixed reviews but figured since it was the second most ordered dish, I should get it. Nope, not good at all, fairly bland duck, and wrapping it up added nothing to it. Skip this.Mixed Grill - I didn't try anything on the mixed grill except the lamb chops, which I was thoroughly disappointed by. A bit too bland and much too fatty. I'm glad I didn't get a whole dish as my main. I heard good things about the chicken, but didn't get to try it.Branzino (fish special) - I really enjoyed this but was unfortunately too stuffed to eat more than a few bites. Tender with a crispy skin, I love the middle eastern preparation of branzino. Still feels overpriced to me though because I've had branzino that perhaps wasn't quite as tender, but was still very good for 1/2 of the price (and honestly my taste buds aren't refined enough to tell the difference). It is a massive fish, very good for sharing (probably could feed 3+ people).Ashta - Very good, and not what I was expecting when I read clotted cream. Not too heavy or sweet.Lebanese Ice Cream - Good, but honestly different taste markedly different from normal ice cream. Knafe Bil Jibneh - It's an interesting savory/sweet dessert, with melted cheese in the middle (that has some sweet syrup on top) that you dip pieces of bread into it. Wasn't my cup of tea, but interesting to try once.Date Souffle - This was a hit at our table, was quickly devoured.Candy Bar - This was good, but felt like a fairly standard dessert.Cinnamon Cheesecake Mousse - I really liked this, probably my favorite dessert. It's not a cheesecake in the traditional sense, so don't be deterred if you dislike cheesecake (like me). It's more like cake, with some mousse on the side. Really liked the flavor combinations.Wiinter sorbet trio - Not a fan. None of the flavors worked for me in the ice cream.",1,0,1,Jenny W.,"New York, NY",22,768,133

Muhamara was sweet which is absurd. Shwarma was terrible, meat was so dry and they put a lot of spices and parsley on it. Our main course was maklube and i swear I haven't eaten anything worse than this in my life. They said lamb shank with fried eggplant, rice and cucumber yogurt but they had to say stale lamb shank with burned eggplant and others, I couldn't say anything about other part of it because I couldn't taste it after i tasted the shank and eggplant.

5.0,4/4/2017,"Without a doubt the best upscale Mediterranean food in the city. I have been coming here since nomad was considered an area to ""stay clear of"" and the quality of food, service, and atmosphere has consistently been top notch throughout the years. While it is quite pricey, you are paying for an incredible meal. The crowd is usually your average NYC upscale diner, as well as a lot of groups and business dinners. Definitely recommend for birthday dinner or special occasion-I had my birthday dinner here last year and the ambiance was perfect for a pre-celebratory dinner. HUGE PLUS is that they are incredibly accommodating for gluten-free diners and a lot of their menu is celiac friendly :). See pictures for the INCREDIBLE falafel starter with hummus, pita and bougie crudités, and their meat platters which come with specific sauces that are drool-worthy (even though it's hard to tell because the dim lighting makes it hard to take a good picture). Oh, and if you don't feel like committing to an expensive/fancy night out, try Illili box in madison square park to get a taste of their incredible food for lunch!!",0,0,0,Polly C.,"Manhattan, NY",0,18,9

4.0,3/22/2017,"Went here for dinner, but wished I'd done lunch. Here's why. Everyone in the neighborhood raves about Ilili. It's a local favorite. And most of the food lives up to the hype. I love Mediterranean food. The Best = Baba Ganoush (one of my favorites) - smooth, balanced with subtle smokiness - this was sooo good I practically licked the plate. The OK - the Black Iron Shrimp - flavors were good but the shrimp were a bit overcooked. The pita bread was good but the butter spread was great. Definitely make sure they bring out the pita bread & spread early. Mine was brought out after the meal. The disappointing - the Kafta - a combination of ground lamb & beef - was served lukewarm & didn't have enough flavor/ spice.  A shame because I was really looking forward to the kafta. The great - the dessert. Tried the milk ice cream & a few other things - really good. The restaurant's atmosphere was visually nice. But they were playing that EDM thumping muzak a bit too loudly. Annoying. I wish restaurants would stop playing that stuff. It's so outdated & the only purpose it serves is none - except to make it impossible to have a conversation. The bill was up there. Given the overall experience, I'd return but for lunch. People in the neighborhood recommend it as a lunch spot. It has a great location, near Madison Square Park. Perfect for lunch & then a walk through the park. And the food IS excellent.",1,0,0,Marie S.,"New York, NY",52,270,196

Our excellent server and his assistant worked together very well, and their effort deserves 5 stars. Beautiful, intimate seating area perfect for our occasion. The food itself was good but not as outstanding as I was hoping for based on the restaurant's acclaim and price point. We split several mezze (hummus with lamb, manti, fried kibbeh, tabbouleh, duck shwarma). The filling in the kibbeh was delicious but the outside could use a bit more crunch. The tabbouleh-- so lemony, tart, and zesty, heavy on the parsley, just how I like it-- was the standout dish, until our dessert arrived. The ashta was heavenly.

2.0,3/11/2017,"Let me preface this by saying that this is the first negative review of a restaurant I have ever written on Yelp - and I have written quite a few over time. I visited the restaurant midweek as a member of a party of four guests for a birthday dinner. Let me get the positives first; the place has a very trendy and energetic vibe to it, and their cocktail selection is interesting. The food, however, was not all that impressive, the appetizers were a-okay but not particularly thrilling. The reason for writing this review and my major beef and is with their beef: Two of us split the 48-day cote-de-boef (humbly priced at a measly $110). What we received was a MASSIVE BLOB OF FAT. A good half to two thirds of the steak was inedible. The waiting staff never checked on us to see if the steak was to our liking - at which point it could be saved- by the time we flagged down our waitress we ate all little we could because we were hungry and left an almost full plate of meat as we were too hungry to wait to get another one prepared or to get her attention. I did not raise any issue with the management at the time only because I did not want to spoil my friend's birthday celebration with bickering. Overall, after dropping more that $120 per person - we still tipped 20%, we are gentlemen you see - we left hungry and disappointed.

5.0,2/27/2017,"One word to describe this place is amazing. I came here twice now and both times I have been amazed beyond belief from their presentation and taste. ilili is quite big and can accommodate a huge group if need be. The service matches the food and atmosphere the place gives off.Let me go over what we ordered:Moussaka (eggplant, tomato, garlic, onion, and olive oil): This is a must get as it basically goes with everything or you can eat it as a spread by itself. A little bit of this on those pita pillows they serve it with and its like a delicious mouthful of flavor.Arnabeet Mekle (cauliflower, tahini labne, chili, and mint): A great appetizer good for sharing with another person. If you are ordering for a group, this will not be enough and a few extra orders is recommended. The cauliflower is sauteed to a nice golden brown on top of a delicious tahini spread that compliments it perfectly.Kibbeh Naye Beirutieh (steak tartare, burghul, onion, and mint): If you love steak tartare then this is a must get. The spread just melts in your mouth and goes well with the pita or just mix and match the moussaka to create a greater contrast of taste.Kebab Kerez (lamb & beef meatballs, cherry sauce, kataifi, and scallion): One of my favorite dishes as the meatballs are cooked perfectly while its in envelope in this sweet but not overpowering sauce made from reduced cherries. A perfect hot appetizer that keeps you coming back for more.Lamb Chops with zaatar salsa verde and herb roasted tomatoes: The lamb chops were just perfect in everywhere. I cannot describe how amazing it was and the entire time it felt like an experience to journey. The roasted tomatoes complimented the lamb chops with a burst of vivid brightness that the dish needed. The salsa verde generously drizzle on top of the lamb chops added another layer. THIS IS A MUST GET.Lamb Makloubeh (lamb shank with dirty rice, fried eggplant, cucumber yogurt, and mixed nuts): The lamb shank was slowly cooked until it falls off the bone. The whole dish is a bit dry even with the cucumber yogurt they provide. The lamb shank was amazing but it needed a bit more sauce for the dish.Knafe Bil Jibneh (up side down sweet cheese tart, sesame pita pillows, orange blossom syrup): An actual fried cheese tart that is a oddity to me. The syrup added a nice sweet contrast to the salty cheese, however, it was not something I enjoy as a dessert.Ashta (traditional lebanese clotted cream, rose water syrup, and seasonal fruit): This is the dessert I would recommend. After a long dinner, you want something that is light and delightful. This is the dessert to go for as its bright and adds a great finish to any mealilili takes things to another level.

Their seafood dishes were superb!We met some friends and friends of friends for dinner. I'm glad that I dressed up a little. When I saw that the food was Lebanese/Mediterranean, I thought of casual environment. Nope! Women were wearing simple elegant dresses or blouses. The warm wooden-panels made you feel like you were in a decadent library. The attentive waiters and servers made you feel like you were getting white glove service and never rushed. We ordered drinks and our waiter started us off with a complimentary savory yogurt app. The yogurt was thick, creamy and perfect with the crispy pita bread. The octopus appetizer was perfectly grilled, served on top of caramelized onions and sweet peppers. The diver scallops were symphony of flavors: crisped scallops served with addictively sweet roasted cauliflower and topped with a tangy cherries. So amazing! The semolina gnocchi sat on top of sweet eggplant cooked in tangy red sauce. The rich cheesy gnocchi was covered in a cloud of celery foam and pine nuts. Apps ranged from $10-23 and entrees started from $25 to $68. So our bill came out around the $75 a person. A friend recommended restaurant week or happy hour as a more affordable option.

The burrata was good, though I do remember having more pistachios on top last time we ordered it. The chicken livers in pomegranate sauce were excellent. My husband ordered tuna tartar. He said the pieces were cut way to big but otherwise tasty. A few of us had hummus. Can't go wrong with that. My daughter chose the falafel. It was an interesting take on it. Almost looked like a thick piece of toast cut in triangles. It was good but could have definitely used more herbs and spices. Then it was time for mAin courses. 3 of us chose the lamb. It was incredible. It was super tender and tasty. . It was accompanied by cucumber (tsatsiki sauce). Would definitely order it again. My daughter had the salmon. The portion was rather small. She said it was ok. If you do not like your salmon undercooked, tell them. Could hardly wait for dessert. Have had Ashta (hope it is spelled correctly) and it did not disappoint!

My three friends and I went through at least four baskets of bread since we ordered all kinds of hummus dips and spreads, and they were all fantastic. I also ordered the falafel, which was also very good but a little salty for my taste.I'm vegan and I will say that apart from the spreads, bread, and falalfel, vegan options are very limited (if any).

Absolutely inexcusable for a $45 entree.

First and foremost, you get unlimited pita bread which you can eat with all of your dishes, they are all warm and puffy and the waiters will swap in your colder pitas with fresh ones. The appetizers here are amazing, and we made a meal out of them because we just wanted to try everything. Some of the items we got:Phonecian Fries - Amazing fries, some of the best fries I've ever had. They're seasoned perfectly and the dipping sauce that came with them is super savory.Kebab Kerez - These meatballs are so juicy and flavorful I could eat 50 of them and keep going. They remind of Swedish Style meatballs because they are cocktail sized and have a delicious brownish cherry glaze on them and garnished with scallions on top.Brussels Sprouts - The brussels sprouts are also very good and savory, feel good about eating veggies! They come with grapes and walnuts mixed in, a very interesting combination.Lamb Hummus - The hummus is very smooth and not chunky at all, this goes great with the unlimited pita. It comes with small lamb chunks mixed in with the hummus. It's a little bit oily at the bottom due to the settling of the hummus which I wasn't the biggest fan of but still very good dish overall.Beef Shawarma - Average dish, comes with some ground beef and veggies wrapped in a pita pocket, nothing too special here.Eggplant - My least favorite dish, the eggplant was sliced very thinly and was shriveled up as opposed to plump and juicy like I expected. The flavor of the eggplant was also a sickly sweet which I didn't particularly enjoy.I still had a great experience eating here, this place is awesome for sharing with friends or if you want to go someplace upscale without super breaking the bank.",0,0,0,Michael Y.,"New York, NY",186,57,3

2.0,12/30/2016,"I'll start by saying that my review is strictly based on the bar/lounge area experience and not the restaurant.I was meeting a friend for a drink at the bar and looked forward to a nice experience based upon the photos and reviews on Yelp.  However, I was disappointed.I arrived to a bar where all of the bar stools were askew and the bar top was messy (not even wiped down).  I had to ask the bartender if he would please straighten up the bar before taking my order.  He did acknowledge the condition, straightened up and apologized.  I ordered a Pinot Noir which was fine yet it was served in a white wine stem glass.  I was a little taken aback but didn't say anything.  I looked at the glass selection behind the bar and didn't see any wider, red wine glasses.  Hmmm.  As I stood there, I felt that the area was way too bright coming from ceiling lighting.  It was not comfortable lighting.  Next thing I noticed was ""chill lounge"" music playing, which I do like, but it was very loud.  There is lounge seating near the bar but again, it was overly lit and not comfortable to be seated in because of it.  The seating also felt gritty like it needed to be cleaned/vacuumed.  Again the tables were not clean and especially noticeable in the bright lighting.  Kind of gross.Unfortunately, there are many other bars and restaurants that keep there bars and lounge areas clean, know how to serve wine and create a more comfortable environment.  I won't be rushing back to Ilili",0,1,0,Stephen B.,"New York, NY",46,282,45
5.0,12/29/2016,"Hands down best middle eastern restaurant on the east coast. It's the one place I make sure to drop by every time I'm in NYC and it never ceases to amaze me. Starting with the beautiful warm interior to the great friendly service and of course the delicious dishes. As a middle eastern my self I think Middle Eastern American food is now its own cuisine. At Illili, however, while most appetizers and entrées have a modern twist they still are either in keeping with the taste palette of Lebanese/Levantine food or the ingredients are beautifully balanced the way Levantine food usually is. We were last there on Christmas Eve, it was pretty busy but since the place is so spacious it did not feel crowded at all.

The meal is mostly tapas style + entrees. We all shared a wide variety of tapas which was more than enough to fill us. This place is also very vegan and vegetarian friendly. The pita bread comes out warm and super fluffy. Yum!! Unlimited pita bread is definitely a plus. The hummus is great. Definitely try the warm eggplant-- sounds simple but it was perfect!! They also have a variety of cocktails. There is a nice waiting area/ bar while waiting for your table or party. All in all a nice place for a group dinner or even date night!

It looked really beautiful.  They had a Prix Fixe menu that was a little pricey and gave you an absurd amount of food. You picked 2 mezzes per person, an entree, a side, and a dessert. The mezzes were UNBELIEVABLE. We ordered a really good sampling of everything: labne, hummus, baba ganoush, tiger shrimp, meatballs, cauliflower, buratta with plum, and lentil soup. They were some of the best meezes I have ever had. The labne was thick and creamy, the hummus was so flavorful, the baba ganoush was smokey and delicious. My family really liked the shrimp and the meatballs. By the time we got the mains, we were all stuffed. We each had maybe half of our entrees, but enjoyed them. I got the only vegetarian main option: gnocchi with mushrooms. It was very inetresting. Different than Italian gnocchi, but very tasty! My husband and mom got the lamb and liked it a lot and my Dad got the paparadelle with lamb and liked it as well. We were so full from the first course though that I don't really feel like we appreciated the mains and the sides.The desserts weren't great but by that time we were so full we could barely even talk, let alone eat.

3.0,12/11/2016,"My husband and I recently moved to the neighborhood and decided to give this place a go. The food and drinks were quite good (drinks, hummus, thyme salad and duck shawarma were all 4 stars or more), but I can only give Ilili 3 stars due to the weird vibe/lack of ambience upstairs and our disinterested waiter. The whole place is just strangely set up. The bar has an odd seating area and is way overlit. The ground floor dining area has a cozy vibe and great holiday decorations, but alas is outfitted only with larger tables (4 tops and more). Which means that couples are relegated to a plain upstairs room that lacks character and feels like a forgotten overflow space. Plus we were seated at an awful dark table next to a partition that separated the server staging area from the rest of the room. Nice.And our waiter could have cared less about us. He made no attempt to course anything we ordered, so we had no time to enjoy our cocktails before 4 of our 5 dishes arrived. If we'd been given a little more time, we would've ordered wine with our food, but no chance. The waiter also failed to ask how we were enjoying our meal or if he could bring us anything else.

1.0,11/12/2016,"The food here is okay. The service, however, is very very bad. The amount of attitude we received from our ""server,"" Vivian, was almost comical. First, it took her very long to finally attend to us and there was no smile accompanied with greeting. We told her we only had about 40 minutes to eat because we were catching a show and asked if 40 minutes was doable with a couple of cocktails and a couple of appetizers. After rolling her eyes, she let us know, ""I guess it's doable if you order cold dishes."" So that's exactly what we did, cold appetizers. For our drink order, I asked which drinks had tequila and what kind of tequila they had. With a heavy sigh and some more eye rolling, she said ""some kind of American tequila."" So I asked her if she could please find out. Some more eye rolling and sighing. She left and she came back with ""so I asked and the tequila is El Toro."" Then silence. She didn't ask me if I still wanted the drink or let me know that it's a great drink. No commentary what so ever, just passive aggressive attitude. Midway eating, we asked for the check anticipating that we had to leave on time to catch our show. By the time we were done eating, still no check. She was picking up some plates at the table next to us and so we asked her for the check again. She said she needed a minute with some more passive aggressive attitude. We said okay. She then proceeded to take another 5 minutes to clean up some other tables. Then finally headed to her check out screen. At this point, my boyfriend had to get up and walk over to her and her screen. She then tells him she first needs to modify the bill. He comes bald to sit down and we wait another 10 minutes while she is ""modifying"" with an assistant manager. He then walks over to them again to see what is going on because at this point we are running late to our show. A second manager finally came over to check us out with the bill. A very frustrating experience at this spot, to say the least, and the worse part was we were really looking forward to eating there. No apologies.

First, I must say that I am a huge critic of Lebanese cuisine. I am Lebanese and believe that no one can beat what comes out of mine or my mothers kitchens. With that said, I am a huge fan of this restaurant and believe they have perfected traditional Lebanese with a modern twist. Be sure to make reservations for this restaurant. We  did not (learned about it on our last night in NY), and waited an hour and a half for a table (though you can receive full service at the bar/lounge). We ordered non-alcoholic cocktails (grapefruit and lemonade renditions), Turkish coffee and tea. All were great! As for the food, everything we ordered was delicious, but here are a few that were especially fantastic: kibbe nayye was very fresh and the batata harra (spicy potatoes) were very authentic. I also recommend the kibbe b Laban as it was a perfect modern twist on a very traditional dish. We had knafeh for dessert, and though it wasn't the best I've had, it was certainly tasty. The only thing lacking in this restaurant is the service. Our server(s) seemed confused, tired, and uninterested. They were not very knowledgeable on Lebanese cuisine, and had to be reminded of things we ordered. Also, the upstairs dining room was not nearly as nice as the downstairs seating (shown on yelp).

The brunch pre-fixe menu was quite awesome as you get a choice of coffee, OJ or grapefruit juice + a choice of one of three typical brunch cocktails + a main plate + a side, all for $28! Plus, complimentary homemade pita bread for the table. There was a large range of options to choose from between the main plates (lots of lamb options) and sides. Although the portion of the main plates wasn't as large as typical entrees' size, the addition of the side and pita bread definitely left me stuffed after the meal. If you order the main plates al carte, the pricing is a bit steep as you pay around $20 for a typical appetizer-portion of food. I would definitely recommend getting the pre-fixe instead. We got the Truffle Egg Benedict and the Awarma Eggs in Cocotte, as main plates. Both dishes were pretty good, but what stood out was the arugula side salad that came with both dishes. For the side, I tried the Mekanek (lamb sausage), which I must say was pretty sour and vinegary (definitely an item to be wary about if you aren't into that kind of acidity with your meat).",0,0,0,Jennifer C.,"New York, NY",168,165,1433

4.0,9/25/2016,"Why don't you just show me the second table first?  Instead they take us upstairs to a room that looks nothing like the beautiful place downstairs and try to seat us at a table in a corner  that is partially covered by the overhang from an unused bar counter. Fortunately they were able to almost immediately accommodate our request for a better table downstairs.  Glad they did because otherwise we would have missed out on an excellent meal. We started with a very good burrata, an outstanding dish of Brussels sprouts, and an OK octopus. The octopus had a nice char to if but still lacked the charred taste that I enjoy in the dish. For mains both couples ordered the mixed grill for 2.  That dish was outstanding.  Everything on the plate was great.   The ice cream and chocolate ganache with pistachio nuts were both delightful.  Service was outstanding.",3,2,2,Lenny K.,"Edison, NJ",303,768,394

We ordered the Lebanese wine by the bottle which was fab. The starters were great too. The only disappointment was the hummus. For a Mediterranean restaurant to serve hummus which is worse than what you get in Sainsbury is unacceptable. The hummus was actually quite disgusting. But the food otherwise was good and the place was great.  Order anything but hummus there.

5.0,9/23/2016,"Ohmahgaadd!! I haven't tried Mediterranean food before but ilili makes me want to have it regularly. First off, the restaurant is beautiful. Tall ceilings and gorgeous lounge area - stunning. Long story short, ilili is worth the high price tag, get them brussel sprout and hommus with shrimp!We started off our night in the bar area for happy hour. They have cocktails for $9, wines for $7-8 and Labanese beer for $5, some small bites. I got the From Beruit to Passion cocktail and my boyfriend got the beer. My cocktail was fruity and sweet. I normally don't like too sweet cocktails prior to eating dinner, but I enjoyed every bit of the drink!! The boyfriend liked his beer a lot - its a pilsner and is a bit darker than a Peroni, for comparison. On to our main dishes: - grilled octopus: fav dish of the night!!! The octopus was sooo tender and flavorful. The bean things that come with the octopus complements the dish nicely. - hommus with shrimp: ya gotta get dissss. Every bit was memorable. I am a hommus lover but this is a bit different. The texture is creamier and the shrimp adds a tremendous amount of flavor. The warm pita bread is also delicious.- falafel: I was confused when I got this dish. Normally falafel come in circular ball things right? At ilili, you get rectangular cube ones. We asked if these are indeed falafel and the waiter confirmed. Nevertheless, it was good but not amazing. -Brussel sprouts: a bit sweeter than most brussel sprout dishes, but man oh man! This dish is definitely unique and memorable. Good starter dish to start, but I would recommend ordering something salty or bland to balance out the sweetness. (has walnuts, for those who are allergic) - Trout: I've never had trout before but it is similar to salmon. Meaty fish with lots of flavor. Good size to share between two people.Come here! You wont be disappointed",2,3,1,Janet J.,"New York, NY",330,204,380
4.0,9/23/2016,"This place is a bit of a mystery to me. I typically don't associate Mediterranean food like hummus and pita, baba ghanoush, fries, and Israeli salads with a club-like atmosphere including soaring ceilings, sexy uplighting, and a DJ booth. And yet you get both of those elements when dining at Ilili.That being said, it makes it a nice choice for work lunches where you don't want to slum it but want to keep it somewhat casual at the same time. Also, though they feature a lot of classics on their menu they mostly have a nice twist to keep it from getting boring. For example, I love that you can add a host of things to your hummus, like jalapeños, or even lobster if you're willing to add $15 to your dip. And they have much more than dips and pita (though the freshly baked pita comes out basket after basket and it's hard to resist filling up on just that). I love their brussels sprouts especially - I think they recently changed their recipe but the dish still has a lovely sweet-savory balance. They also have a great chopped salad with a Syrian cured beef that I had never heard of but really loved - a great alternative to cured pork which is typically in salads! I left the last dinner with a bit of a bad taste in my mouth because our waitress, though friendly, was so overly aggressive in encouraging us to order a ton of food. Even when we decided we'd start slow and go a bit short of the huge number of plates she suggested, she made us feel like we were making a big mistake and said 'I don't want you to go hungry.' No, actually, I think you just want a big tip, because the thing about a restaurant is that you can usually order more stuff if you do find yourself still hungry. And by the way, we ended up with so many leftovers even after ordering just a fraction of what she recommended! Beyond that, the service has always been stellar and it's fun and funny to feel like you're in an upscale NYC space while dining on casual and fairly affordable food for lunch and dinner.",10,6,11,Christina P.,"Culver City, CA",4723,2090,4060
4.0,9/21/2016,"Overall, this place is great. Excellent service and attention to detail (they continuously removed pita from the table to replace it with fresh, warm pita). There were some definite high's from the meal and a few misses.Highs:The Brussels sprouts. Seriously. My boyfriend does not even like brussels sprouts but I insisted on getting a vegetable and he went for seconds. He has not stopped talking about them. Hummus. So simple but so easy to mess up. I like that you can customize it. We kept it traditional with lamb and pine nuts and it was perfect. Meatballs. The sauce was delicious and the brussels sprouts and meatballs together complimented one another nicely. Misses:Phoenician fries. I'd seen photos and people rave about them, but I felt they were lacking in flavor and kind of floppy and not crisp enough.Knafeh. I LOVE knafeh, and it's one of the reasons I picked this spot for my birthday dinner. It wasn't terrible, but the crust was a little too crumbly and not set, the flavor of the syrup was a little off and the sesame purses they put around it was truly puzzling to me. I've had knafeh many places in the Middle East and never seen it served that way. I wanted to love this, but it left me disappointed. Drinks. They were average at best.",0,0,0,L M.,"Indianapolis, IN",0,7,6
3.0,9/20/2016,"I've been here a couple of times, and each time the food gets slightly worse. Not MUCH worse, but a tad less spice, or too much salt to compensate for the lack of flavor. Let's start off with the Lebneh and the crackers. The Lebneh was amazing.. probably my favorite part of the meal. This time the Lebneh was slightly less amazing than the other times, probably not as fresh. We had a few appetizers this time in lieu of a main plate. For hot mezze we took the Beef shwarma.. 5 stars. I knew it would be good because I always get this and it never fails. We got the batata harra.. mixed feelings. Too salty 1. good, but overpowering. I have previously ordered the phoenician fries and felt the same way. The Brussel sprouts i give four stars. They were good, but tasted like they have been out for while. The falafel cubes are 3 stars. They dont taste better than the typical new york style falafel. In terms of main courses, I have had trouble liking the plates.

Also, the jalapeno hummus and the brussels sprouts are must haves. And the dessert was equally amazing! The ilil candy bar was delicious, especially to a chocolate lover like myself!

We moved to the main dining area for dinner and ordered a number of appetizers and entrees to share. The naan, hommus, and grape leaves were very flavorful and I highly recommend them. The octopus was good but a bit under seasoned. The Brussels sprouts was at the right crispness for me and not too oily. By the time the lamp chops came, we were too full to even take a bit of that dish. The staff was attentive and refilled our naan when needed.

2.0,9/15/2016,"Having trouble understanding some of the rave reviews about this place. Yes, the food is good. I did like the mezzes. But I have had much, much better Middle Eastern right here in New York. There are literally dozens of terrific Mediterranean restaurants all over and this is not one of them.  The main problem is service, which is poor. Don't come here expecting classic Lebanese hospitality; here you get ""hipster Manhattan neglect."" We came when the place was not especially crowded but the snooty and unhelpful waiter seemed to have better things to do than wait on us. When he finally arrived after ten minutes I asked about the moussaka, asking if it was prepared in the Greek fashion, he told me that it had no meat. That was it. No further elaboration. We'd have to guess. Then he took our food and drink order and disappeared.The gent sitting at the next table, who had been here before, wisely asked for his check at the same time as he ordered. He arrived after us, but was served while we had gotten nothing. No bread. No drink. Just water. Hearing us complain about the service, he explained that it was always poor, which was why he asked for the check in advance. Complying with his suggestion, we called over what appeared to be a head waiter and told her that we would walk out in sixty seconds if food was not delivered. That resulted in delivery of two of our the mezzes. They were good, as I said. Everything but my main ourse then piled on about five minutes later. I mean, don't they time orders here? My Cubano Beiruteh sandwich was delivered approximately one hour after we sat down. It was OK, as I said. A spicy Cuban sandwich, something like you'd get at a Cuban restaurant in Washington Heights but at a multiple of the price. We wound up paying $90 for this glorious experience. including one nonalcoholic drink.This is basically an expense account place if you don't want to talk with someone (the noise level is high) and don't much care about food or service.",1,0,0,Humphrey B.,"New York, NY",12,230,6

3.0,9/14/2016,"We've been going to upscale middle eastern restaurants in several cities recently, such as Shaya in New Orleans, so I had pretty high expectations.  The food here was pretty good but there were certainly some misses.  We focused on the mazes so we could try more dishes and there were only 2 of us.  We asked the waiter how many dishes to order and he said 3 or 4 per person.  Honestly, I knew that was crap but we ordered 6 dishes anyhow.  4 were plenty.  Maybe 5 if you are a big eater.- Hummus with lamb - liked this quite a bit.  Hummus was very creamy.- Brussel Sprouts - way too sweet.  We at this last as a dessert but it was hard to finish.- Beef Fried Kibbeh - I thought it was too dry but my husband liked it.- Cauliflower - this was ok but I likely wouldn't have it again.- Manti (lamb dumplings) - good and unusual.  This was a winner.- Duck Shawarma - my favorite dish.  Tasted like a Greek peking duck.The main room is very pretty but noisy.  We were first seated upstairs which was bad - quiet, low ceilings, stuffy.  We asked them to move us so they put us in the back room which was also not that great but at least it had some life going on.  Service was a little stressful. It seemed like the waiter couldn't keep up.  The bus staff kept our water glass full but spilled water each time they were refilled.  We were served the hummus first than much later they brought out the other 5 dishes at one time.  We debated if that was the right thing - there are pros and cons.  It certainly made our tiny table crowded but you got to pick at each dish and finish the ones you wanted.  Lots of bread was included - way more than we could eat but it was generous.  Cocktails were good.",0,0,0,Deb R.,"San Mateo, CA",5,90,11

We ordered lamb chop which cost 42 but tastes horrible! Two side dishes recommended by the server, one came as a bowl of rice I thought that was suppose to go with the lamb because the meat was just too salty, but that bowl of rice was actually a 10$ worth of side dish and the rice is hard to chew on, the other appetizer was a salad, too oily and too much mint.

Yes this place is a bit more upscale so be prepared to pay more than you would for street halal, but it's worth it. Romantic, intimate atmosphere with high ceilings and great service.Came here for restaurant week with a friend and was blown away by the hummus, which is made with tahini, lemon, and olive oil. Texture was so creamy and you can really feel the difference from the other places. But be warned it is a little bit salty and you will find yourself downing many glasses of water. The complimentary pita bread was BY FAR the best pita bread I've ever had--nay--best complimentary carb I've ever had. Amazing. I had to stop myself from asking for another basket. The grilled chicken wrap (with garlic whip, lettuce, and kabis) and cubano beiruteh sandwich (lamb and pork sandwich with kashkaval and pickle mustard) also surpassed our expectations major. Chicken was so tender and lamb was so juicy, my god. Spicing and seasoning were on point. We also had the ilili candy bar, which si a dark chocolate ganache, fig, caramel, dulce de leche, and salted pistachio bar that was packed with flavor. Additionally, couldn't not try the ashta, which is a traditional lebanese clotted cream in rose water syrup and some season fruit. The rose flavor in here is unbeat--so potent... so beautiful.

The place is gorgeous with high ceilings and a cool vibe - I was mildly (ok pretty) disappointed that my husband and I were sat in the smaller low-ceiling room off the main dining room, which was intended for larger parties. The bar area is also a dream - very loungey and casablanca like. Perfect for a romantic (and $9) cocktail. The food - so my favorites were hands-down the duck shwarma, Brussels Sprouts w/grapes, fig jam, walnuts, mint yogurt, and the warm eggplant.

1.0,8/28/2016,"I have been to Ilili so many times in the past and always loved the food although they lack the spot on service a restaurant of this size and caliber should provide. That being said, last night was the last time I will ever go there after such a disastrous evening with the poor service and mistakes the staff made. I was with a party of 5 and specifically requested a table that would not be crammed. Upon arriving I reminded the staff of my party of 5 were arriving soon and reminded them of a larger table. When guest arrived, table was set for 6 people-no big deal, but they took forever removing extra setting and spacing chairs evenly. All of that was not a big deal. Here's where the problem began. I asked waitress to put my and friend's tab on one tab separate from rest of group as we are meat eaters and our share certainly much more expensive than if we divided up bill in end. She said she couldn't give us two separate tabs and I said we always have done that in the past. Not wanting to settle for her answer, I asked to speak to manager-a short guy named Stephen appeared and in a very dismissive way said we can't accommodate your separate tabs and walked away. I called him back when he left immediately but he would not return. I followed him to front desk and questioned why, and told him I expected a separate tab and would not dine there if it is otherwise and sat down. Dinner itself was such a mess-I ordered a dish which server immediately dished out for other quest on my table-which I made clear to original order taker that we were having separate meals. Several other missteps as well I won't delay getting to what really ticked me off. Bill came combined!!!!! I went back to manager and he said he couldn't do anything about it and he wished I wouldn't come back to the restaurant.After I insisted he change bill-he said it's already been done and at my table. Why couldn't they do this as I wished the first time around instead of upsetting me prior to dinner!! When I checked bill, I was charged for item that was served to other guests and charged my for tap water which appeared under ""bottled water"". They also charged me for ""hot sauce"" I requested for my $110 steak. I was so beyond everything by the end of meal that I called manager a shorty and told him I felt like punching him!!!!!

4.0,8/11/2016,"This would be a Restaurant Week (summer 2016) review.I came here on a Thursday night with 5 other friends.  We arrived in batches, and for 7PMish, the bar area was a little crowded, but the bartenders were very attentive. For what it's worth, the From Manhattan to Beiruts (Bourbon, st. germain, orange blossom water) were pretty tasty.We were promptly seated once the entire party was there, and the wait staff was very attentive from the get-go, and fed us as much complementary pita as our hearts [stomachs] desired.  For appetizers, you get to pick 2 items from the RW menu, and since there were 6 of us and 12 appetizers to choose from, we just ordered one of each.Hummus - it was pretty standard, but that's a good thing...because standard hummus is still...delicious hummus.Mouhamara -  nice consistency, good balance between sweet and smokey.Fattoush - a light, but flavorful salad...which was helpful in cutting through some of the other heavier dishes. Sumac vinaigrette was very refreshing.Kibbeh Naye Beirutieh / Steak tartar - big fan of steak tartar, and this was a nice, healthy portion. Moussaka - Only got to try a little bit, but from what I tasted...it's worth ordering.Falafel - interesting presentation with the square 'balls', but still tasty.  A bit crisper that most, but I like a crunch, so that was totally fine with me.Arnabeet Mekle - Cauliflower with delicious tahini. Chicken Liver Mousse - I'm a sucker for liver...and not many other people were, so that was totally fine with me. Rich, decadent, yum.Burrata - Can't say I would have expected this at a Lebanese restaurant, but with the Za'atar (I've been obsessed from a young age...Israeli father), it was quite the treat Tuna Tartar - yum. What can I say, I like tartar things.Manti  / lamb dumplings - this was the winning app in my book, especially with the yogurt sauce. Kebab Kerez / meatballs - nice, with a slightly sweet (but not overly) sauce. good firmness.For my main, per the recommendation of our server, I had the arctic char.  It was a surprising large portion given that we were ordering off of the RW menu, but that's totally fine with me. It came on a bed of grains and a puree of some sort (I forget...too many Manhattan to Beirut's I guess). Either way, while being slightly overcooked, the char was plentiful and tasty.  Other people in the group had the steak, the short ribs, the lamb chops, and the gnocchi...there were no survivors.For dessert, we pretty much ordered each one, and doubled up at the labne cheesecake and knafe...and then we ordered another candy bar, haha.Candy bar - decadent chocolate goodness, with pistachios (if you order off the reg. menu, comes with ice cream as well). Very very good.Labne Cheesecake - I'm a cheesecake lover, and this was a fine cheesecake.Ashta - interesting dish of clotted cream, rose water syrup, and berries. Light, creamy, great.Knafe Bil Jibneh (upside down sweet cheese tart / sesame pita pillows orange blossom syrup / pistachio dust) - this was something I've never seen or heard of, especially for dessert. BUT IT WORKED! Warm gooey cheese, tinge of syrup, pistachio dust...it really does much for a delicious, tad be heavy, dish. Share and feel no guilt.Great food. Great service. Will come back to try these famed brussel spouts...which I totally flaked on ordering. Again...I blame the Manhattan to Beiruts haha.",2,0,0,Steve L.,"New York, NY",157,309,1204

I found this restaurant when I was throwing my husbands birthday party here last year and has become our favorite place to grab some Lebanese food for lunch or dinner. Lunch is more casual as where dinner is more formal. The staff is super kind and friendly, the servers are very knowledgeable about every item on the menu, even pronouncing them correctly, and the managers on the floor are attentive and supportive to their staff. We have ordered almost everything on the menu by now and i cannot complain about a single thing. From their appetizers which are presented very nicely, to their main dishes, which are on the large side, to their unique desserts, every item is a must try. Their main dining room is more loud during dinner, and if your on a date or want a quiet environment, ask to be seated upstairs. They have a bar in front and seating area to wait before being seated.

With each person being able to order 2 appetizers, we were able to sample almost all of the ones listed. Fried cauliflower, steak tartare and the falafel were all delicious. The eggplant and salad were decent. I had the short rib as my entree which wasn't the best choice. Although it was full of flavor, it was very dry and tough to eat. The arctic char proved to be a better choice. My dining mates devoured it. The desserts were very small but a good size for such a heavy meal.

Also had the Brussels sprouts, which were very rich and filling, and the baba ghanoush, which was smoky and tart and finished with good olive oil. The pita comes warm and puffed, and was the the perfect complement to the dishes. I stopped in on a Sunday night and there were no tables available, but the bar and lounge area were nearly empty and actually quieter than the restaurant seating area. The atmosphere is comfortable but the music might have been too loud if you want to have an intimate conversation.

3.0,7/29/2016,"This review is for dinner on a Restaurant Week Wednesday, which probably accounts for the lower-than-average rating.Ambiance: the main dining hall is loud and elegant, with high ceilings and warm lighting. We, however, were seated 10 minutes after our reservation time in a room upstairs and off to the side. There, we had not much to look at and were packed in next to our neighbors in a way I would expect of a tiny East Village restaurant, not a sprawling midtown establishment.Service: As we probably should have expected, we waited 20 minutes to place our order (even for drinks). But the (clearly overburdened) waitress was very nice.Food: After all that - really excellent and well-paced. Recommend: the walnut dip, pita bread (it has cinnamon in it! yum!), cauliflower appetizer, burrata, and Arctic char. Maybe skip: hummus (it's kind of thin and tasteless), ""short rib"" which is more like a hanger steak.Snapped a pic of one of our desserts, the rest you'll have to see for yourself.",0,0,0,Sarah G.,"New York, NY",52,94,47
4.0,7/24/2016,"I can definitely see what the hype's about. Food here is innovative without being pretentious, and super comforting. I enjoyed the Green Lemonade. It was light, with a strong cucumber and lemon notes. The brussels sprouts with grapes, yogurt, and walnuts I thought were interesting, but a bit sweet for my taste, while the lamb sausage mezza I found a bit sour. I wasn't a huge fan of the eggplant, since I thought the sauce was a bit overpowering. But the grilled octopus was incredible! Tender, charred, and paired perfectly with the creaminess of the chickpeas. Onto the best part: MIXED GRILL. Please get this (and thank me later). It's worth every penny ($66 for 2 people). The mixed grill came with pita, garlic whip trio, and a perfectly cooked and flavored assortment of meats (chicken with sumac and plain garlic whip, beef, lamb chops, and kofta). The best part was by far the garlic whip trio of mint, pepper, and beet. I unapologetically lapped up what was essentially an entire plate of super garlicky aioli, smearing it without abandon all over the pita and meats. That stuff is crack, man. Don't come here on a diet! Anyway, I also unapologetically asked to take home two chunks of meat that I couldn't finish. Kind of regret not unapologetically asking for the last mouthful of beet garlic whip to go along with it as well.   For dessert, we got the knafe, a cheese dessert covered in phyllo dough, which came with a small tin can of rosewater syrup to be poured on top. I thought it was decent, but maybe would have held back a bit on the syrup, which I thought made the dough soggy. I guess I'm more used to the Turkish version of the dessert, kunefe, which doesn't usually come with syrup. Still impressed and always happy to see the dish on a dessert menu in NY though!I strongly recommend the mixed grill, grilled octopus, and to a lesser extent, the knafe.

4.0,7/21/2016,"As someone who rarely eats Middle Eastern and Mediterranean food, I'm so glad I came to Ilili to try it out. In total, I ordered 5 mezzas to share with my friend (4 hot and 1 cold). Scroll below for more details and pictures! :)ServiceGreat service. Delicious and hot bread was restocked every time we finished the bread basket (which happened more times than I'm proud of). Atmosphere was great, we sat on the upper floor so it wasn't as loud as the first floor. The restaurant is big and spacious with high ceilings but the second floor had a more intimate feel to it. Cold MezzaHummus with Lobster: Absolutely divine. They were generous with the lobster and the hummus was so delicious - not too heavy or overpowering. Not to mention the warm bread that's restocked on our table every 15 minutes really complimented the taste.Hot MezzaBrussel Sprouts: I was excited to get this dish seeing how many people liked it and while it was good, I found it a bit heavy due to the grapes, nuts and sauce.Beef Kibbeh: I found the beef kibbeh quite heavy since it was generously stuffed with meat. I wouldn't recommend eating all 4 of them by yourself like I did (my friends a peschetarian). Be sure to share with one or more friends. Eggplant: Loved the eggplant as well. It was warm with a nice texture. I usually eat eggplants prepared in the Chinese way so experiencing this new style was great.Octopus: Probably the best dish of the night. Seasoned perfectly, texture was chewy and just all around delicious. I expected the portions to be small but it was perfect for 2 people!All around, great restaurant!

We ordered five small plates between the two of us: the octopus, warm eggplant, lobster hummus, beef kibbeh and Brussels sprouts. My favourites were probably the octopus (so tender and flavourful and just chewy enough!) followed by the lobster hummus. Everything else was really great too albeit a little strong in flavouring- I had to drink a lot of water! Good thing they also give you these unlimited pita things to eat with the food.

ALSO when we were seated at first, we were placed at a table in the dimly light back room. There was barely anyone in the back room and it felt like a punishment to be placed there. I had made reservations through Open Table so maybe that is the table the restaurant has designated for those reservations. But it was terrible and I was very relieved that they accommodated our request to be seated at a circle table in the main room. Especially since this was a celebration dinner and I had written that in the special requests section of my reservation! Anyway, besides that incident, the food was incredible! Literally everything we ordered was delicious. The dishes were mostly small plates. My favorites were the duck shawarma (bigger portioned), octopus dish (bigger portioned), falafel, and the fries. The drinks were made strong as well which was deeply appreciated. We were brought fresh ""bread"" constantly which was also appreciated.

This is the best Lebanese food I've ever had in the US (not just NY), no exaggeration. After years of being repulsed by how Lebanese food is presented and portrayed in America, I've finally found a place where I can truly enjoy Lebanese food outside of my mothers kitchen. Ilili provides Lebanese cuisine with a slightly modern twist, yet it maintains a very traditional stance. My family always orders the following: fattoush, hommus, kibbeh naye, falafel, Phoenician fries, Brussels sprouts (not a Lebanese dish, but I highly recommend), and duck/and beef shawarma.

5.0,6/13/2016,"O.M.F.G. I don't know how else to describe this place aside from the best, most unique Mediterranean meal you'll ever eat. My boyfriend and I came here for our one year anniversary (I chose the restaurant because A. I LOVE Mediterranean food and B. I'm on a strict diet that doesn't let me eat added sugar, grains, alcohol, dairy, or legumes, and Mediterranean food is the easiest cuisine for me to eat). I made the reservation for 6 P.M. on OpenTable; when we got there a bit early (about 5:40), the restaurant was able to seat us immediately in their upstairs lounge. The restaurant itself is beautifully decorated and can cater to any occasion you see fit. If you're looking for a date night or even an anniversary dinner -- like myself -- this restaurant is upscale and classy, but it is also a great place to dine out with a group of friends or colleagues. There was even a private party upstairs who rented out part of the restaurant, so this place is good for any occasion. In lieu of bread, the waitress brought out these cinnamon-coated thin crackers with a cream cheese dip that my boyfriend really enjoyed. For appetizers, we ordered the octopus and the baba ghanoush, two of my favorite Mediterranean dishes. Though we didn't get the hummus this time, there was an option to order a lobster hummus that I definitely want to try the next go-around. Both appetizers were incredible -- the octopus wasn't over-grilled like many places do it and the baba ghanoush was perfectly smokey. The accompanying pita was freshly made and had a hint of cinnamon on it, too. For our main courses, my boyfriend and I ordered the swordfish with a tzatziki sauce, the scallops in a brown butter sauce and the brussels sprouts in a fig jam with grapes and walnuts. Unfortunately I didn't realize that the tzatziki sauce had dairy in it, but regardless, the sauce was INCREDIBLE and complimented the fish so well, so I guess I can let that one slide. My boyfriend enjoyed his buttery scallops just as much -- there wasn't a bite left by the time we were done. The highlight of the meal, surprisingly enough, was the brussels sprouts. The jam made the sprouts so sweet and flavorful that even my boyfriend was devouring them. They were sweet and savory at the same time, unlike anything I've ever tried. If you come here, GET THE BRUSSELS SPROUTS. Overall, I enjoyed this meal beyond anything I could have hoped for and I will absolutely be back. Pricey? Yes. Worth it?

Most impressive to me was the menu they had at the reception with the restaurant logo being an Ambigram! (look it up if you don't know what that is).What's interesting about this place is that it can be trendy, intimate, romantic, classy and upscale all at this same time. It's a great Lebanese restaurant with a very sexy and classy crowd that is good for couples, friends and even families. My favorite food to eat out is actually Arabic food and I would say this place provides the perfect formula for both ambiance and deliciousness which is really hard to find when looking for Middle Eastern places to go out. We ordered the combination platter which is a must, especially in groups of 2-3 so you can try all their meats. The lamb is flame! Probably the best I ever had. Hummus was good and falafel was just okay (they are served in cube form..kinda weird). The complimentary bread is everything (you'll see once you give it a try).

As for me I've been there quite a few times. The service has always been great. A perfect example is from this past Saturday. My brother didn't like what he ordered. Not because it wasn't good, it just wasn't satisfying his appetite (he got the pancake when he should've gotten a lamb burger) so he didn't finish it. They asked if he wanted anything in it's place but we had to go so wasn't in the cards. So instead they didn't charge us for his meal when we received our check. Mind you we didn't bring anything to anyone's attention. I didn't even notice he wasn't really eating it until she said something to us. I think her name was Terri. I really hope I'm right, she was awesome. I really appreciated the gesture more than the savings. You don't see this kind of attention to detail everywhere!",0,0,0,Samir B.,"Queens, NY",119,7,0

I would suggest getting an appetizer, the hummus for example, so you can enjoy the bread.I was tempted to try the cocktails but when I told the waiter I don't like them to be sweet his suggestion was to leave out the syrup they add--sounds like a bad sign. I asked about the wine and our waiter recommended a red wine that I really loved (at $16/glass it better be good).

I like certain restaurants in Alabama for their southern charm, and I love the mom and pop ambience and that certain familiarity of many Tucson restaurants. Then I came to Ilili's in the Big Apple. Ilili's ? Call it loud, call it the city energy, whatever it is, it is quintessential NY, loud abashedly unapologetic, yet uniquely classy. We ordered Bordeaux and Malbec to start off and three light fairs: roasted Brussels sprouts, moussaka, and beef fried kibbeh. Many restaurants do roasted Brussels Sprouts well these days, but none better than Ilili's. The mixture of grapes, walnuts and brussels sprouts was better than one could fathom. The moussaka was flavorful and pleasing in texture. The Fried Kibbeh was crispy outside and soft and tasty inside. After seeing the branzino at the next table, we decided to give it a try. Oh my. The flavor of fresh fish was retained while the added spices and oil enhanced the goodness of the fish. We ended up eating every bit of the flesh and the skin of the fish. I don't give 5 stars to a restaurant after one visit. Ilili almost made me break my practice. It is a wonderful culinary experience here!!

5.0,5/11/2016,"First time I came here for Restaurant week 2016 and ordered the burrata, lamb burger, and the astha. The burrata blew me away! The mix of the texture of the cheese with the fig and honey was incredible. The dish is pricey but I think its worth every dollar! The lamb burger was also very good. I have a hard time ordering lamb from restaurants because of the smell. Lamb shouldn't smell so strongly and if it does its either not fresh or just not good period. However, the lamb burger was so fresh. It was incredibly juicy and the addition of the tzatziki sauce took it to the next level. The astha was okay to me, I'm generally not a fan of sweets. The service was incredible that day too. They gave us the wrong dessert and instead they not only gave it to us for free in addition to the desserts we ordered but also provided the table with their jasmine green tea. It was overall an incredible experience especially for it being during restaurant week.The second time I came here was for dinner. We ordered the burrata, the cheese rolls, the assorted pickles, the manti (lamb dumplings), the brussel sprouts, the fries, the kafta, and the gnocchi. The cheese rolls were so yummy with the hint of mint in them. The fries are a go to with the garlic whipped dip.The gnocchi were amazing. They were soft and very favorable. The yogurt and spices added on top took them to the next level. The kafta was my least favorite dish. The mix of beef and lamb ground beef was a good idea but the lamb was so overpowering in smell and taste I just didn't enjoy it. I could tell the lamb and beef were not fresh. It was also on the dry side. The brussle sprouts were just good. I loved all the flavors but I wouldn't order it again, I rather get a second order of the burrata. The manti (lamb dumplings) were okay. Again I found the lamb not fresh based on how overpowering in its scent and taste it was. I barely touched that dish. Also the service again was wonderful. They moved our table upon request and the waitress also walked us through what my dinner partner could and couldn't eat as he had an allergy. I wish however they would have the lamb burger as a dinner option as well. It's too good to limit it just to lunch! Some of us work late and can't make it before 4!!Anyway I will keep going back.

Our waitress, Maya, demonstrated how to properly layer the ingredients to balance the flavors and maximize the taste. Maya was fantastic throughout the night.

The labneh in particular was AMAZING - I probably would have just eaten it off the spoon like ice cream if I weren't in public. The pita it's served with is warm and brushed with cinnamon and spices - it smells like churros and is DELICIOUS.For mains we got the brussels, duck shwarma, lamb sausage, and fries. The brussels were so good served with the grapes walnuts and yogurt, and converted a former brussels hater. My favorite was the duck shwarma, which was so flavorful I could have gotten another order if my table had been amenable. We finished with the ilili candy bar, ice cream, and sorbet. The candy bar in particular is amazing - a kind of chocolate ganache on wafer with flavors of sesame and served with salted caramel ice cream.

I think the lamb chops were my favorite, but all the meats were grilled deliciously. I highly recommend just mixing and matching various meats with the different sauces and dips. The brussels sprouts were also amazing! This place left us satisfied and happy, but it may not be for those with less adventurous palates.

They are amazing, and they're blackened just the right amount. I love the mix of the crunch of the walnuts, the tart sweetness of grape halves, and the salty-sweetness of the yogurt. I dragged the bf here after coming here once for a dinner that was paid for (I consumed almost the entire 2 orders of brussels sprouts then - thankfully no one else seemed interested in them for some reason). We ordered brussels sprouts (!!! but of course), phoenician fries, duck shawarma and lamb sausage. The dishes came with pillowy soft pita/bread-like slices perfect for the strong sweet or salty tastes of the dishes. I'd have loved it with some hummus or babaghanoush but unfortunately we felt too full to order more. My bf found the tastes too strong in general. He's typically a burger and fries sort of guy but strangely wasn't as impressed with the fries as I was. The lamb sausage was okay, would not order it again as it was quite salty to me. The duck shawarma, though, was a solid dish. It came in two cones (kind of like Japanese hand roll holders) and the duck wedged inside was flavorful. It was both darker and noisier than I remembered: sometimes I had to raise my voice significantly to be heard. It was the same when I was here as part of a huge group - we could share all the hot and cold mezzas, but we could also barely hear each other and had to keep leaning in attentively. This time, we were also almost seated uncomfortably close between two couples on either side, but thankfully managed to shift to an empty table off the side...until the adjacent two tables were filled up in the next few minutes. Oh well. I was a little hesitant about the total bill since this time we unfortunately had to pay for ourselves (lol) and rightfully so. It was fun, but I'd rather not pay $80+ again for this: I'd rather go somewhere simpler, or spend that on a prix fixe meal instead.

Not really, but that's at least what it means to me.My friend and I rolled in here around 9:00 on a Wednesday night without a reservation and the place was packed. My initial impression was pure class, even though we wanted to keep it informal and sit at the bar. The 10 or so stools were all taken so we went and talked to the hostess, who brought us to the upstairs dining room, which isn't obvious from the main floor.Our server gave us about 5 minutes to settle in before coming over to take our drink order. We opted for Almaza - a Lebanese beer - to keep things authentic. It was a first for me; very similar to Heineken. Somewhat skunky in flavor. For $9/bottle, you may not taste a whole lot of difference if you opt for the Heiny at $8.As for food, we started with the hummus ($9.50), which was so obviously fresh, but in hindsight, I wished we hadn't ordered it since the mixed grill platter for 2 ($66) came with 3 different butter spreads and more bread than we could handle. The mixed grill (chicken shish taouk, beef kebab, kafta, lamb chops, garlic whip trio, seasonal grilled vegetables) doesn't look like a lot of food once you're served, but it's very filling. Most importantly, all of the meat was so, so tender. We just barely finished everything and left no opportunity for dessert.Overall, the food and ambiance were excellent. The service was as well, but there seemed to be a miscommunication between two waiters who both approached our table within minutes of one another to see what we wanted to drink.

The food here is amazing.  We ordered a number of the smaller dishes.  We had the Labne, which is strained yogurt with olives and mint, and that was great.  The black iron shrimp has a wonderful spicy kick.  The falafels were interesting.  Unlike the way I usually have them, in a ball, these falafels were rectangular shaped.  At first, I thought they served us brownies!  Once cut open, they have the same look, and went wonderfully with the tahini they served.We also had the arnaneet mekle, cauliflower served over tahini with chili and mint.We also ordered the rkaykak bil jibneh, cheese rolls.  These looked like tiny egg rolls from a Chinese restaurant, but were filled with feta cheese and mint.  Yum!!!The spices were perfectly mixed, but you definitely notice the mint, which is in most of the dishes.  This is not a complaint, as I love the taste of mint.  Their spicy dishes had a kick, but the heat was not overpowering.  For dessert, we had the ashta, which is clotted cream with fruits, crushed pistachios, and rose water syrup.  What I liked was that it was not overly sweet, but refreshing with a wonderful taste.The food here is also a feast for your sense of smell.  As we left, I remarked to the table next to us that, although I was full, the smell of their dinner was making me hungry again!My only regret was that my brother and I were abstaining from meat that evening.  I definitely would love to visit again to try the meat dishes, which included various kabobs, duck shawarma (I really want to try that next!!!), lamb sausage and lamb bacon.The food here can be pricey, but we left happy.",0,0,0,Joe L.,"Astoria, Queens, NY",152,368,1027

The first time I asked to move and they accommodated. The second time I was so embarrassed by where they sat us and by the unacceptable service we received that I will not come here again. They sat us upstairs right next to the service station, even though there were many open tables all around the restaurant. The main appeal of this place is the architecture and ambience of the dining room. Other than the delicious hot pita it is just overpriced hummus, dry falafels, and rude servers. The food is ok, but not the reason to come to ilili. There is better, cheaper Mediterranean food in the LES (like Souvlaki GR). The service upstairs on Saturday 2/20 was horrible. Our waitress barely attended to us, spilled our expensive wine all over our table, tried to oversell us on things we did not want, and brought out everything-appetizers and main courses- at the same time.  I tried to like this place, I even gave it a second chance, but never again.  Goodbye forever.",1,1,0,Gerald S.,"New York, NY",4,25,0

For dessert I had something called the Ashta, which was clotted cream with berries and they serve all their desserts with a rose water syrup.

I think they are upgrading their decor, I saw huge curtain like fabric hanging on the walls in their lobby .. But I didn't see or hear anyone working while I ate there.

1.0,2/6/2016,"People who have no idea what an authentic Lebanese food taste like will sure think that this is it! This is a joke !! Tried it after reading the reviews. Let me start by saying that at best you can describe it as 'Lebanese' food but not a Lebanese restaurant. And again, this is not am authentic Lebanese food.During restaurant week i tried it for dinner $38 per person: u get two appetizers, one main, one dessert. The appetizers were a complete joke: hummus was 3 spoons only!! I have never seen this in my whole life in any Lebanese restaurant before! The eggplant one was the size of a 4 years old hand! That's 2 spoons of food and wasn't that good! Tasted out of a can! The fattoush was so boring and 1/4 the size of the regular portion of any other place. Now the main course: makloba ( meet with rice and nuts) i swear to god there was one and a half spoon worth of rice there!!!! And rice is cheap! Meat was tasty though.The chicken sheesh tawuk was 4 small pieces of dry grilled chicken. Sad sad sadWe ordered diet coke, they served it regular. I called the man who got them to us, asking if this was diet. He said yes! I replied no it is not. And he just looked at me and left!!! I called our waitress, she was nice ( Diana) and she apologized for him and brought us new ones, ( half full) they were diet coke this time. I know the taste...im an expert. But even if i wasn't this is rude and unacceptable especially not for $4 for half a glass if coke.If you want the knafa for dessert you need to add $6 for that on top of the $38And since i was craving it i did..not worth it. The khesshta was another joke, one spoon of milk cream(khesshta) and few berries The noise was unbearable!!!! The place is huge, and crowded. People seated next to us kept screaming at each other allll the time in order to hear each other. No Lebanese music, no Lebanese hospitality, no Lebanese generosity, no Lebanese culture or feeling.

My girlfriends and I came for Restaurant Week and we were so pleasantly surprised and delighted.   The restaurant week menu was a choice of 2 appetizers, 1 main entree and 1 dessert. With 4 people, we selected different items each and shared so basically had a wonderful sampling of everything.  Highlights of our experience:Ambiance - very chic and trendy but also cozy. A great place for a dinner with close friends or a date night. Food - absolutely incredible! Everything was very flavorful and cooked to perfection. My favorite dishes had to be the cauliflower appetizer and the brussell sprouts side dish. The dishes are all small plates so its best to order a bunch of different things and share family style so you can taste everything. Service - unfortunately I wasn't that impressed with service which is why I couldn't give them a full 5 stars.  Our waitress wasn't very friendly nor personable and was a little pushy to clear our plates. I assume its because of restaurant week and they were trying to get us to move along our dinner faster so they could seat other parties but it just felt like she was trying to rush us.

It's also drenched in good olive oil.Warm Eggplant: tomato, scallions, tamarind molasses. It's more interesting than the baba ghannouj because the eggplants are warm and the molasses makes it a sweet dish.Phoenician Fries: sumac, parsley, garlic whip.

The lamb burger is definitely amazing- the melted feta and pickles take the cake. I'm a huge fan of the roasted beet side dish- the Aleppo honey butter just made it perfect.

My friend and I were basically sharing everything - hummus, garlic eggplant, falafel and the marinated chicken liver. Like the eggplant the most as it was refreshing; chicken liver was a bit disappointing...Both the chicken and lamb chop were fantastic, juicy! I opted for the vanilla panna cotta for dessert. Thanks to the sour raspberry on top, it was not too sweet.Service was for sure a minus point here - cannot blame them as we all sort of understand how RW could mess up the whole thing.

We ordered pretty popular items, such as the duck Shwarma, Brussel sprouts, hummus, and the warm egg plant. The duck was my favorite. That really did blow me away. However, I expected the Brussel sprouts to be better. To me, there was too much going on- too many flavors. There were grapes on it, as well as nuts and A LOT of sauces. I didn't like the taste of this specific jam, it took away the taste of the actual vegetable. Also, it was $15.50 for a small portion. It wasn't worth it. The hummus was plain, but it was pretty good and smooth. The eggplant was good, but maybe a little too salty. I do rate this restaurant 4 stars, though, because the service and atmosphere is incredible. This place is pretty classy, and the waiters are attentive and friendly.

That was the beginning of my great experience at ilili.  Translation: great for groups!  We were seated promptly when the full group arrived and our server immediately took drink orders, while we explored the menu, which could be a bit overwhelming, as in most Mediterranean restaurants. There are a ton of small dishes and it's hard to decide how many you might need while grappling with the decision on main dishes, some of which were quite pricey.  My recommendation is the order 2-3 smaller plates per person and then share main dishes.  All the taste, wonder and Lebanese flair are found in the assortment of appetizers. We loved everything we tried. Top favorites were the dander greens and tabbouleh and green lentils.  They have an extensive wine list, from around the word, including Lebanese wines.  Speciality cocktails and traditional Lebanese liquor also available. Be careful when ordering dessert.  Lebanese ice cream is quite different than what we are used to in America, or even from traditional Italian gelato. It left a little bit of disappointment at the end of our excellent meal.  However, some of the other desserts like chocolate soufflé and candy bar were delicious. Wish I knew what was in the building before the restaurant, as the space is quite unique looking. There was a lot of wood paneling and glass. It felt grand, but subtle. Huge ceiling heights with 3 long, but wide, rectangular rooms, separated by wood panel walls with sporadic glass windows.  There was an upstairs as well, but the stairs seemed hidden in the walls, except for some glass panel openings.  As spacious as the restaurant is, one side of our table was directly against another, so it was difficult to get in and out. Perhaps because of our large group. I recommend trying ilili.  With wine and dessert, expect to spend $75-100 per person.  You can cut down that cost by ordering more appetizers and sharing main courses.",0,0,0,Stephen F.,"Manhattan, NY",74,268,161

The horseradish sauce and side of au jus really helped it, but I was hoping for chunks of lamb by the description and not shavings of lambBack to the FRIES AND WHIPI could have had 3 servings of this and been happy!! IT was flavorful hot and delicious. The server told us that the whip was on youtube because we surely asked about it.  IMO:  The table beside us had 8 small plates that they shared.  This probably should have been our route considering we enjoyed the small plates more than the entrees.  The place is pricey (bill about $150 with sparkling water and shared falafel (good, but I could have passed.  They were square and not round which was interesting. Dipping sauce tasted slightly of peanut butter which was odd).I would definitely go back and get the fries and a small plate with protein.  Staff was excellent: Patient; provided feedback on dishes to try, attentive etc. Did not try dessert, but will try dessert with coffee in future (someone had coffee that smelled delicious!)",0,0,0,Steph E.,"Philadelphia, PA",1,16,0

5.0,1/12/2016,"This is one of my favorite restaurants in the city - solid 4.5 stars.My boyfriend took me here yesterday to celebrate my birthday. I'd been here almost five years before, and always talked about how much I loved it and I was so glad for the opportunity to eat here again. I love the ambience of the restaurant - it's dark, classy, but with a young and modern vibe. The main room has a lot of bigger tables for groups. We were seated in a quieter room to the side, with lots of tables for two for a more intimate atmosphere.Food is very good. They provide free crackers with a super creamy and thick labne yogurt dip. The menu has a large selection of small plates and a few entrees. We ordered four small plates and one entree to share.Muhamarra - decent, though my least favorite of the bunch. I expected it to be creamier and more hummus-like. Instead it was very thick and more sweet than expected.Brussels sprouts - really delicious. The sprouts are super caramelized and tender, buried underneath a tangy yogurt sauce, walnuts, and grapes. Loved this one.Mujadara croquettes - also decent. Comes with two really big lentil croquettes. The first few bites were delicious, but the taste does get a little old after that. We were deciding between this and the phonecian fries, and I kind of wish we got the fries instead.Octopus - SOO good. I really loved how tender and juicy the octopus was. The generous pieces of octopus sat atop a bed of lamb bacon (ugh I think this made the dish), chickpeas, and eggplant. Would order again. Lamb chops - excellent entree. Lamb was very flavorful and tender, with the perfect ratio of fat to lean meat. The tomatoes and sauce that came with it were actually really good and memorable too. We didn't get dessert this time, but at my previous visit I got the ilili candy bar. To this day, I remember how delicious it was.

Veal Bacon: it was cooked to perfection not to crispy and not to soft. Was extremely flavorful and juicy unlike most bacons. Black Iron Shrimp: I loved this, was spicy with the jalapeño and garlic but the cilantro cooled it down with a great after taste. Beef Fried Kibbeh: I could have eating these all day, small beef dumplings with a great sauce. Great taste and texture. Brussels Sprouts: great pairing with the fig jam and yogurt, I'm usually not a fan of the sprouts but they were great. Meatballs: for the life of me I can't recall the exact name but they were meatballs with nuts and other meats inside. They were ok a bit dry but still good.

The space in the restaurant is beautiful - modern and chic with a clean layout. Atmosphere is busy without it feeling too crowded. There was no denying the food was good - all the unique ingredients came together well and very balanced - making the dishes extremely flavorful and tasty.  But I wasn't entirely ""blown away"". That was probably due to the high expectations prior to coming in.We ordered the Duck Shawarmas ($20), Kafta - spiced ground beef and lamb ($23), Brussel sprouts ($15.50), and the Phoenecian fries ($12) for two people and it was a good amount of food. The Duck Shawarma was new and interesting and the Brussel sprouts were unique. I've never paid that much for a side of Brussel sprouts, but it was definitely the highlight. They were sweet - soaked in mint yogurt topped with grapes, figs, and walnuts. All the dishes were great to try once, but I wouldn't go out of my way to try them again, especially how pricey everything is for small plates - hence 3.5 stars.

5.0,12/29/2015,"For the longest time, I had been looking for the perfect opportunity to eat at ilili. I'm happy to say that when I finally did, it completely met all of my expectations. I made a reservation and arrived early, so we checked in and waited in the fancy lounge/bar area for a bit and observed our surroundings. The interior is beautiful and modern-looking, and the dining room is illuminated by candles in the evening.There are two ways to approach dinner at ilili. You can choose a couple of small plates (mezze) to start, followed by a main plate for each person; alternatively, you can select a bunch of mezze to share with the table as your primary dish. The latter appears to be the more popular decision, and I later learned that mezze are often served as the main meal in Lebanon. There are so many enticing options on the cold and hot mezza sections of the menu that I couldn't pass up in favor of a main plate, so we limited our order to the small plates.I don't think I've ever been so excited about hummus before. ilili's hommus ($9.50) is pretty standard in terms of ingredients, with only chickpea purée, tahini, lemon, and olive oil. And yet, it's some of the best that I've ever tasted. It's even better when paired with warm pita bread, which is light and fluffy in texture, and replaced with a fresh basket each time a new dish is brought to the table.The arnabeet mekle ($14), a hot mezza consisting of cauliflower, tahini labne, chili, and mint, was well-balanced in flavor, but a little overpriced in my opinion, as it only contains a few cauliflower florets and a ton of tahini labne.The true showstopper is the warm eggplant ($14), a status attributed to the amazing tamarind molasses. Honestly, I would be satisfied just eating a entree-sized dish of this eggplant. Regardless of the other mezzes you choose, make sure you order this one. My boyfriend also tried the duck shawarma ($20) - he liked it a lot, but I can't speak to its taste.Will I be back to ilili in the future?

It's just a whole bunch of wooden tables and chairs, just like an elementary school lunchroom or your grandma's house. No ambiance whatsoever - kind of weird for a 5th avenue restaurant. The food was also just OK - the cauliflower, as everyone said, was very good. There were some other tasty dishes as well but can't remember the names of everything. Additionally, I wasn't a fan of how every dish that came out required the waiter to do something to it. He was either adding olive oil, cutting something, stirring something else or whatever.

4.0,11/19/2015,"My group and I were looking for a gem of a Lebanese restaurant, because where we're from, we don't have any food like that! So we were given ilili as an option, and we quickly decided to take the plunge and check it out. We had a group of five people that made reservations on a Wednesday night for dinner. We got a 7:15 time slot right away when we called, so thankfully that was seamless. So we called an Uber and were on our way! When we arrived, they quickly seated us and gave us menus, drinks and waters. We all looked at the menus, and I think everyone of us had crossed eyes, because we had no idea what we were looking at-- except the one in our group who was married to someone from Lebanon-- now that was convenient! So he talked us through some dishes, and ordered food for the group. When our first round of courses came out, they were mainly dips and sauces that you dipped the amazing pita bread into. This round of food was amazing. The sauces were flavorful, tangy, and just downright great! With the second round, we received some more hardy dishes, which still included more pita bread-- winning! Lastly, the third full course was the meats! The chicken was probably the best I've ever had-- wow. There was also this raw beef that was my absolute favorite of the night. I could eat that stuff all day!! Delicious. Also, there was this orange creamy garlic spread that was epic. If I could just eat that raw beef smothered with that orange sauce, I could die happy. We also ordered some desserts which were good, but nothing to write home about. So the overall experience that we had was great. The service was fantastic, the staff was attentive and our drinks were always filled. The bathrooms are interesting as well, as the bathroom is unisex and each toilet has its own little room with a sink-- pretty cool, honestly! This restaurant loses a star because they wouldn't work with our group and split a check. We were a group that consisted of people from two different companies, and we each needed to have separate checks, but they wouldn't do that for us-- only one check per table the waitress said. So if you need to split checks, you may want to consider going somewhere else.

We were all there and got seated even a bit early which was great, but we were waiting for the last guest for a long time. Once I had finally reached her on the phone it turns out she had asked the hostess multiple times to join our party.

The guest said the hostess was incredibly rude, unhelpful, unwilling to investigate. Eventually she gave up, deciding it must have been the wrong restaurant or time. The manager eventually came over and offered a dessert for free which was peculiar because none of us had said anything about our friend being turned away -she must have know the hostess had mistakenly turned her away and tried to rectify the situation with a complimentary dessert. nice gesture but obviously not enough of an apology or 'fix' for my taste. on principle, must say I won't be going back or recommending to anyone.",0,0,0,Michelle B.,"New York, NY",6,31,3

5.0,10/5/2015,"Fun with Taufiq was the theme of my last ilili adventure (Taufiq was our server).My older sis and her BFF were in town for BFF's 40th Birthday... I suggested we go to ilili before Broadway- *very* NY - sophisticate, interesting and the type of cuisine they would not easily find in Durham, NC or Buffalo, NY. Soooo Taufiq introduced us to Arak.  An anis lebanese aperitif that is drank *before* the meal to aid in digestion and relaxation (think of a much less potent version of absinthe, ouzo or sambuca). He gave us samples and discussed how the arak comes out clear, but due to the oil, it has to be mixed with water in order to drink it... We then ordered a smorgasborg of mezes.... many of which I discussed in my last review. Here are the highlights of NEW items that I had not tried before:1) Amuse-Bouche of Labne with Honey and Zaatar: I didn't get an amuse-bouche last time... we are not sure if they gave this to us since Taufiq new I was a yelp-er or if it typically comes free w/ all meals. BUT, it was delicious. The zaatar and honey added a complexity that I have never tasted with labne.. and the spiced crackers were delish. Note: this specific lane dish is not on the menu. 2) Fattoush Salad: This was the birthday girls favorite item. She ADORED the dressing that was full of fresh lemon and sumac. I liked it, glad we ordered it, but was not my favorite (Horus Cafe on A still has my fave Fattoush in NY). 3) Phoenician Fries: Don't think just order! Seriously. Everything about these fries, from the freshness, the spices, the dip... incredible. 4) Warm Eggplant: WHAT? ""This tastes like a hamburger"", said my sister. I said, ""Wow, this is eggplant jerky. I never knew something like this existed"". So we asked the server, who in turn asked a colleague to explain HOW they make this dish.  It starts with dehydrating the eggplant for a few days, then soaking it in a tamarind sauce, then smoking it... then drying it.. then putting it on a plate for it to become one of those ""things that makes you go hmmm"". If you are vegetarian, I highly suggest this... who knew?5) Knafeh: Taufiq insisted that we order this... (I really wanted to try the candy bar dessert.... or even the baklava again, but he said we *had* to get this). It came out and was good, as the orange blossom sauce made it interesting... but it was not outstanding. For OUTSTANDING KNAFEH you just must go to Tanoureen in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn. I think ilili's Baklava is stand-out and should be ordered over the knafeh, if you want a traditional dessert...",1,0,0,Fazeela S.,"Brooklyn, NY",205,341,350

Im a fan of mediterranean food, so I am quite biased in commenting on the food but it was so perfectly delicious (some less than stellar restaurants end up with overly greasy or dry dishes, not this place, perfect). Of course I have yet to make it back a couple more times to stamp it as Amazing, but it is very close. The white-coffee, which is orange blossom essence on water, is the perfect palate cleanser and so soothing. Granted, for what it is it may be considered a little pricey.

5.0,9/14/2015,"ilili, you did right by me. mMmm.Walking in, the restaurant and lounge's extremely high ceilings and beautiful, albeit sometimes visually tricky, open and mirrored wooden framework that enclose the dining and bar areas give ilili a very grand feel. Luckily, if it's intimacy you seek, there's a second floor dining area for smaller parties of around 5 or less. (I don't actually think you have a choice here. The main dining room on the ground floor seemed to only accommodate larger parties.)The menu features a lot of ""small"" plates and main entrees but my boyfriend and I decided to enjoy more of the menu and share 7 hot and cold small plates. I say ""small"" because by this city's standards, there was a generous helping of food with each dish. Now let's talk food (in the order they came out):Warak Enab Bil Zeit, or more commonly known as stuffed grape leaves, was delicious and came with 7 of them. I love the texture of grape leaves in general and the tomato oil and parsley oil they used added a nice zest to each mouthful.Kibbeh Naye Beirutieh was a much pastier and heartier version of steak tartare than I was expecting. It's very good spread on the freshly made pita bread they provide and the onion and mint crudites that come with the dish.Warm Eggplant was warm eggplant. But no, it was good. It was a touch too salty for me but still tasty. It was cut so thin that I felt like I was eating eggplant chips. Be sure to mix in the scallions well, which nicely balances out the salty sweetness of the dish.Brussels Sprouts with grapes, fig jam, walnuts, and mint yogurt, was one of my favorites of the night. The fig jam provided a pleasantly new flavor to a familiar vegetable that I don't often eat/cook beyond a simple saute, sprinkle of salt and pepper, and maybe a touch of lemon zest. I highly recommend it.Mekanek was also another favorite. The combination of lamb sausage and lemon was at first a little jarring but after a few more bites, my taste buds couldn't get enough of it. And it's not like you get 5 or so little sausages. We must've had 10+.Batata Harra was a deliciously spiced potato dish if you feel you need some starch. The little cubes were perfectly crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside.The Duck Shawarma was the last dish to come out, and I'm not sure if it was because I was sufficiently stuffed by then or not, but I was a little underwhelmed by it. With all the pita and other stuffing, I couldn't taste much of the duck or chicken in each wrap (total of 4).Service was also on point. Our server was very attentive and well informed about the menu. Overall, I loved the different flavors of each dish, and I was never left wanting in terms of portions. If you have a chance to eat at ilili, please do.",1,0,0,Christina F.,"Brooklyn, NY",95,289,11

Firstly my server didn't seem to understand or recognise the difference between the cappuccino that she delivered to me and the espresso that I ordered (later charging me for both coffees and then discounting the espresso). She argued that the espresso does ""come up quite large"" when I suggested that the frothy drink in front of me didn't look like an espresso. The food was delivered very shortly after ordering, the brussel sprouts and the veal bacon were delicious but they were the only dishes that were. The sausages were extremely lemony, a strange combination of tastes. The prawns were overcooked. The duck egg that our server had recommended was just a pot of melted cheese, which was nice obviously, who doesn't like melted cheese, but it was just very unimpressive.

5.0,8/14/2015,"Visiting New York for work in Fall of 2014, the group went here for dinner one night. Outstanding! Probably the best middle eastern food I've ever had. Of course, it's probably the only place I've had middle eastern food at an upscale sit-down restaurant. Later in the week, once the meetings were over, I went back for another dinner there with my wife. I sure wish I could find something like this on the opposite coast.Between the two visits, I probably tried at least a bite of 3/4 of the dishes on the Mezza portion of the menu. Although I used the word ""appetizer"" on the photo of that page of the menu I uploaded, we treated them the same as Tapas, pretty much making our meal out of several of them.I tried a couple of drinks from their drink menu that were like nothing I've had before -- fabulous. I also tried an Arak, and while I am really not a big fan of licorice tasting drinks and would not order it again, I can understand the appeal and I'm glad I tried it.All of the food was excellent. Service was outstanding. Interior design was impressive.I ding them a bit on noise levels. With the group from work, we were seated in the main dining room, and the sound level was just not very conducive to conversation.

I also recommend getting an order of the duck schwarma  to split between four people as an appetizer (they cut it evenly for you).

5.0,8/12/2015,"It's that magical time in NYC, no not the holiday season but Restaurant Week: where restaurants across NYC dupe patrons into staying through dessert by offering a lame, non-filing meal at a pre-fixe price. Not Ilili. My business partner and I came in with 2 clients as walk-ins and were seated right away--we've been in several times for dinner and lunch exceeded expectations. It was our first time for lunch and it met my 2 5-star standards: I did not leave pissed off about anything and I tasted flavors used in ways I have not experienced before. How does a Mediterranean restaurant do burrata better than my local Italian joint?!Our server was not a total jerk when I explained that I had a legit allergy but was actually fabulously helpful. He was not overwhelming or aloof, which is frequently the case with lunchtime staff. The support staff was on point, as usual, which is refreshing to see at lunch as well. Summer lunch is a tricky thing to make appealing when it's disgustingly hot and humid outside. This hit it out of the park AND was not a total Restaurant Week dissappointment. As in, I didn't leave and immediately have to get a slice. The burrata with thyme infused olive oil was beautifully presented and really tasty. My 2 clients got the lobster roll--they both horfed them down without much speaking. That's always a good sign. My partner got the lamb burger which was, ""cooked perfectly and didn't taste like a dirty grill"". I had the lentil croquettes and the shrimp served bubbling hot in a cast iron skillet--I got those 2 to play it ""safe"" but was truly impressed on their execution. People so frequently overdo the simple dishes like these 2, but the shrimp were definitely fresh and the croquettes craveable. Desserts came out within our time constraints (our guests had to be in and out within a certain time) and were perfectly sized for a pleasant end. It's really easy for me to end up hating myself when it comes to dessert but their beautiful, bold, and delicate desserts let me walk out, dignity in tact back out into the inferno of NYC in the summer.",0,0,0,Brantlee C.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,4,0

Though I think the entree size was pared down from the norm, or at least I hope it was (as it was quite small), the size/portions of the appetizers still made the RW menu a good value. The cauliflower app was my favorite. For entrees I had the lamb shank - it arrived off bone which was surprising (as that's not expected with the ""shank"" description) but it was still nice and tender. My friend had the scallops (only 3 on the plate...and there was a supplemental cost for this entree...hence the small portion comment)...luckily it was all excellent tasting so it made up for it. But still, a supplement for 3 scallops? Will I be back? Possibly, but I hope that they learn that RW is designed to bring more customers in and not an opportunity to shrink portion size!

4.0,8/5/2015,"Super cool vibe, great for groups at the bar or for dinner. Good option for this area! Here's the low down- Let me wait AT THE TABLE, for my sister, something no NYC restaurant let's happen, they get all ""IS YOUR WHOLE PARTY HERE? NO? THEN WAIT OVER THERE."" Drinks, ordered the Pinot noir and it was actually GREAT. Would totes recommend. would not recommend the strawberry basil iced tea, it tasted like those boba drinks but without boba.Went for restaurant week for dinner and the highlights were the mezze. Honestly, I would come here and ONLY order a buncha that. Hommus was perfect, Kibbeh Nave Beirutieth (steak tartare) was crazy good, burrata was perfect (it came with this olive oil I wanted to pour into my mouth a la one of those hoses used at frat parties), moussaka was delish and light, and let's be real, the pita bread basket was bangin'.For entrees, the gnocchi came with this super light foamy yogurt that was really tasty and the lamb makloubeh was cooked well. All tasted good but hard to follow the mezze. Desserts, the candy bar was the best, super small, but probably a good thing since we ordered ""another round"" when it came to the break basket.

But I was led upstairs into a quieter, simple dining room with appropriately-spaced linen-covered tables. Our waiter approached and then the fun began. I was fairly new to Lebanese food and received an excellent, enthusiastic and not-too-long briefing with some solid recommendations and a few items to sample. My guest arrived a few minutes later, turned out to be quite knowledgable about the food and had a different, but equally illuminating, conversation with our waiter. I'll let others describe the food in detail, but we mostly followed his recommendations and everything we had was fabulous. The service was not only well informed but well judged (not too much, not too little). The prices were reasonable by NYC standards.

1.0,7/29/2015,"If I could give negative 5 stars, I would. Three weeks ago, on a beautiful sunny Sunday, my sister and I looked up the best lebanese place in all of New York (which was supposed to be ilili) and took a friend who had never even had hummus to give him a taste of our delicious food. We had a reservation and were seated at a nice-looking table, the decor was refreshing with high ceilings and small touches of the mediterranean. From there, it went downhill. The Service: Our server was somewhat friendly, but did not seem to really care about whether we were ready to order or if our water glasses were empty. At some point, I started getting a bit of an attitude from her. We all had to try so hard to flag her or ANYONE down that we started laughing at how ridiculous this was. The Food: Still hoping that the food would be worth the mediocre service, we ordered a lot of food. The Baba Ganoush was missing a lot of things, it was not what it should really taste like. The Mohammara was terrible with a super sweet bell pepper taste; the first words out of my mouth were ""Is this dessert!?"" The Tabouli was the only edible dish on the table, although they missed the part where the parsley and tomatoes are supposed to be very finely chopped, but the taste was on point. The French Fries with summac were SUPER salty. The Falafel were made into cubes which were painful to eat because they were overdone and the corners were sharp... we make them into wheel shapes for a reason, people! The mixed grilled meats platter consisted to overcooked, over-salted meats, especially the beef kebab which we couldn't swallow because it was so chewy. Then came our Man'oushi bi Zaatar which they actually brought as a Man'oushi bi Lebne and the waitress set it down on our table and left to check whose mistake it was, then came back, took the plate, and apologized. Okay.. then she brought the correct order, and set it down and left. With the next batch of plates, she brought us a hummus plate which we had not ordered. She set that down and we told her we didn't order it, so she took it back to the kitchen then returned with it and said ""oh this is from the kitchen as an apology for the mix-up earlier."" I asked our waitress for more water and she came, filled my glass and splashed water all over the plate I was eating from and without an apology or even a glance, she turned and walked away.When it looked like we had finished eating, they cleared off plates we were still picking from without asking. We didn't say anything and contemplated desserts. When the waitress told us the Knafe bil jibneh would take another 15 minutes to make, we settled for ordering 2 turkish coffees and a decaf coffee/espresso. I proclaimed to our friend ""Arabic coffee is the best and honestly, there's no way they can screw up coffee!!"" I jumped the gun on that one because what was in my cup was NOT Arabic coffee, the water tasted really bad and whoever made the coffee has obviously never done so before. After boiling, the coffee wasn't left to settle before they poured it, so I ended up with a huge blob of the stuff in the bottom of my cup. The Jaw-Dropping Ending: the check came around, which our friend insisted on paying, and we left, only to stop at the entrance for a few minutes waiting for my sister. All of a sudden, our waitress strides up to us in a huff, and asks our friend ""was everything okay with the service today?"" to which our friend, ever the gentleman, said ""yes, it was fine."" (WHICH IT WAS NOT!) So she proceeded to tell him that the normal amount of tip would be some amount and he told her to add it on because he's nice like that (he had left her slightly less than 20%). I know this gentleman is generous and, for truly good service, has tipped more than half the amount of a  hefty bill. I watched this exchange honestly flabbergasted then I became angry. I marched up to the hostess and told her that the food was not that great and the service was terrible, then I stood there, at a loss for words (I didn't want to take it out on the poor girl who had nothing to do with it) so she said ""I understand you're upset"" and I said ""yeah"" and walked away vowing to never step foot in a place that was supposed to feel like home, making us proud to be Lebanese.. No, I will never even mention this embarrassment of a restaurant again unless someone asks me where they should NOT eat Lebanese food in NYC.",6,1,0,Lily A.,"Alexandria, VA",0,3,0
3.0,7/29/2015,"ilili has been on my to-eat list for quite a while and I'm happy I was finally able to come for Restaurant Week. It was nice, but I wasn't blown away.The first floor is beautiful and I want to come back just to sit on the comfy couches near the bar. Unfortunately, my boyfriend and I were led upstairs and squeezed in between 2 other tables while there were plenty of empty tables around. I was ticked off, but I chalked that up to us using the RW menu. Meh.Anyway, the food was pretty good. RW offers a great value of 2 appetizers, along with an entree and dessert. We got to sample plenty of food and were full before the entrees even came out! For appetizers, we tried the burrata (tasted just like mozzarella, the cream inside didn't add anything; not worth the $6 supplemental charge), falafel squares, moussaka (served cold; didn't like it), and kebab kerez (lamb and beef meatballs with cherry sauce; twas very good!) The Phoenician fries weren't on the RW menu but it looked so delicious I had to get it. They were so flavorful and was paired with delicious garlic dip. I'm going to make a bold statement here and say they were the best fries I've ever had! For entrees, we shared lamb makloubeh and diver scallops. The lamb was tender, but too earthy/bitter for my liking. The diver scallops were done perfectly though, definitely worth the $6 supplement. For dessert, we had the ilili candy bar and ashta (clotted cream with rosewater syrup). The candy bar was nothing special but I fell in love with the ashta! The cream itself is bland, but it pairs amazingly with the sweet rosewater. If I can have one of those every night with a cup of tea, I'm a happy camper.",3,1,0,Helen D.,"Oakland Gardens, NY",75,254,168

High ceilings and narrow entry way that leads into a cute bar, seating is in another room to the left. Lots of little mirrors (different kinds of glass, color) decorate the wall. Service is attentive and very polite.The RW dinner menu was $38 for pre fixe meal of 2 apps, 1 main, and 1 dessert. There were four of us so we were able to try all the appetizers (the ones that you don't have to pay supplementary charges for). Favorites were the baba ganoush and steak tartare. Least favorites were: the hummus - a little bland for me but then again I'm not really a fan of hummus and the salad because it was just a salad. For our main, we all got the braised lamb with fried eggplants, rice, and yogurt cucumber sauce. It was delicious! Very flavorful.For dessert we shared: -Clotted cheese - the syrup it was in was cloyingly sweet and too floral for me. Would not recommend it.-Cheesecake - delicious and not heavy at all, great way to end the meal!-ilili candy bar - very sweet and thick, reminded me of a upscale Twix.

2.0,7/25/2015,"If I had to rate the food I would of gave this restaurant 5 stars. But because of the poor service it made my experience uncomfortable and jaded. I went with 4 of my friends to enjoy restaurant week. Our waitress already had a tone as if she was talking to her children, using the words ""hunny"" and ""sweetie"" to refer to us. Yes we are all above 21 years old. I was infuriated with this constant reference and she took it a step further while saying ""here is the non alcoholic cocktail list because I know you can't drink and if you do I need to ID all of you"". Regardless if we look young you should never as a server belittle the customer until he/she makes a decision and then you should ask for identification. As I ordered a cocktail she looked at me with a surprised face continuing her sassy attitude. I gave her my ID, which I'm clearly over 21, and she says with a sassy tone ""What year is this *chuckles*"". Which I kindly proceeded to tell her my birthdate and where it was located on the ID, but I'm pretty sure the commentary was not necessary in finding a birthdate on an ID. I understand that laws are strict and waiters need to be proactive. But that doesn't excuse the sassy attitude and belittle nature of her commentary and tone as if we weren't qualified to have a dining experience at this restaurant.

I read raving reviews and the place looked divine. We ordered hommous, fattoush salad. The hommous was freshly made. The vinaigrette was subtle and light in the fattoush salad.For entree, I ordered the mixed grill to sample what ilili had to offer.The kafta lamb chop was tender, but slightly chewy. The beef kabob was incredibly flavorful - it was my favorite. When it came to service, I was extremely disappointed. They were not rude to me, but my client. The waitress rolled her eyes and she never came back to ask us how the food was. When she took our order, she smiled at me but was curt to my client.  The server was rude to my client as well. My client has a hearing disability due to a recent accident, so they could not hear what the server was saying. Asked to repeat, and the server was sighing and had a monotonous tone.

Every dish had some sweet flavors to balance out the savory, which I personally love, but may not be up everyone's alley.

5.0,4/30/2015,"I have been to Ilili three times in the past few years and I can easily say it is one of, if not the most amazing restaurant I have ever been to. There are several ways to approach eating here. The best way is to order only mezzas (appetizers) and share with the table. I went with five people, so we ordered a lot, but the best mezzas we had were the Mouhamara (a delicious walnut spread that I put on just about every thing they served us--you absolutely must get it), Kibbe Naye Bierutieh (steak tartar/carpaccio), falafell (small cubes made from chickpeas and vegetables), octopus, Rkaykat bil Jibneh (probably the best cheese rolls I've ever had), Kebab Kerez (very rich, buttery meatballs soaked in yogurt) and Duck Shwarma (bread filled with duck and greens.)The food is always amazing, as is the service. If you're early, they sit you down near the bar for pre-dinner drinks. Its a beautiful place and it is not just a dinner you have there, its an amazing experience that you get to share with your family or the people you go with. You ahve to be prepared to be there for a while. It is not an in-and-out diner, you're encouraged to take things slowly and enjoy and savor every bite, which you should.

When we spoke to the manager he argued with us about our situation. Instead of trying to make the situation better he continued arguing and only made matters worse by calling me names. We went about our meal and the service was slowly getting worse and worse. By the end of the meal the waiter simply stood there and looked at us expecting us to clear our plates. I am surprised this place is still running with the poor quality of service. The food is good but the service is despicable. I will never come back here and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone!!!!

5.0,4/18/2015,"Ah, this place. I very rarely like creative spins on the traditional dishes my family makes, so the first time I came to ilili back in 2009, I was skeptical to say the least. It exceeded my expectations and more. ilili takes Lebanese classics and elevates them JUST the right amount - maintaining the dignity of the dish while offering something entirely new and thoughtful and inventive. I've come back numerous times for dinner over the past six years, and my go-to favorites are: kibbe naye, mouhamara, kibbeh bi laban, octopus, the kafta, duck shawarma, and kebab kerez. For cocktails, I always ask the bartender to make me his/her favorite with a few noted preferences (not too sweet, etc.), and they always do something interesting and wonderful. For the wines, I stick with the Lebanese offerings because they remind me of holidays in Beirut -- Chateau Ksara and Massaya are classics.

4.0,4/17/2015,"Beautiful restaurant and huge, Ilili in many ways is Lebanese tapas. The atmosphere was friendly and dimly lit. The food was outstanding. We tried their group appetizer for a party of 8. I think we may have added onto it (I'm too lazy to look at the menu right now) but in retrospect, that turned out to be a very good amount of food, and we are a group who really enjoys eating.  We wound up ordering individual entrees as well and ultimately had way too much food.  If you're going in a big group, consider sharing the group apps, and maybe order a few additional entrees to share, but not for everyone.  Also, not surprisingly, it's pricey.On the plus side, they have large, round tables for big groups. We appreciated that as it allows for better group interaction as opposed to long, rectangular tables.  Also, we were never pushed to leave, despite hanging out for an additional 45-60 minutes after finishing our food.  We were allowed to stay and just enjoy our company.

The space inside is massive and decor was on point. 2. The service was outstanding (as expected from a top notch 5th avenue restaurant). We were greeted nicely and sat early despite our half an hour early arrival.3. Now on to the food: we took half an hour to decide what we wanted but the hostess was nice enough to go through the menu. We got the 1. Phonecian Fries with garlic sauce. The fries were good but the sauce was to die for. 2. As for our second appetizer, we opted for the Octopus salad. It was succulent and not overly chewy. 3. The DUCK SHWARMA...OMG. I thought I loved duck before this place but omg, do I really love duck now. The swarma (came in two servings) was just simply amazing. It had a series of sauces in it which were too complex for me to decode but that's fine because all in all, the complexity of the ingredients gave it the perfect taste. As for our main dish, we got the $66 (!!) mixed grill kebab platter. It had chicken, beef, and lamb kebabs grilled to perfection. They weren't over or under cooked, and the lamb chops were done in medium heat. It also came with three different types of sauces which I forgot the name of but it doesn't matter. They all tasted great.As for drinks, which are a bit on the pricey side, we got the Brazilian cucumber gin and a glass of Lebanese sweet wine to complement our food.

3.0,4/16/2015,"Came here for an intimate birthday dinner and I have to say, I wasn't overly impressed. I had been wanting to try ilili for a long time and when I finally did I thought it was good but not amazing. Part of it may have been that we were seated in a room off to the side directly by the entrance to the kitchen, and it felt almost as if I was eating in my own apartment with that view. My favorite part of the meal was the appetizers - the kibbeh and duck bacon pancakes were really tasty. Also, the side of brussel sprouts with dinner was quite delicious. However, I was not particularly moved by the mixed grill main plate. It was fine, but just not a stand out dish to me at all, and may have been better served with rice - and this is coming from someone who considers herself to be a carnivore. Lastly, we were unimpressed by the Lebanese ice cream. It had a weird texture and not too much flavor. So, overall very meh :/",2,1,1,Cynthia S.,"San Francisco, CA",32,209,0

4.0,4/15/2015,"This place came highly recommended by a local with impeccable taste. So my girlfriend and I made it the start of our Saturday night out.Arrived at precisely 8:30 for our 8:30 reservation. The place was packed (the couple in front of us were told the wait would be 40 min), and after confirming our reservation we were directed to wait in the lounge. The lounge was full of people, many of whom had decided to order and take their meals there, rather than hold out for the 40 minute wait. Unable to find a seat, we went to the bar for a pre-meal cocktail. I decided to try one of their featured drinks, The Beachcomber, a light and tart rum and grapefruit concoction that I found to be well-balanced. After 10-15 minutes (I thought the idea behind making reservations was to ensure immediate seating), the hostess notified us that our table was ready and we were seated. Unfortunately we were given what must have been the worse table in the restaurant, no more than six feet away from a server station and back-of-house entrance. The experience was sitcomesque, as my chair in particular was bumped or kicked no less than a dozen times by various staff members during the meal. I understand that every restaurant has less desirable tables, and if we had been walk-ins I probably wouldn't complain at all. But to be seated at such a table after you've made a reservation for an evening out is incredibly disappointing.Our server Lauren was knowledgeable and passionate about the menu. She was able to give additional insight into each item we asked about on the extensive menu, coursed our meal for us, and offered suggestions for the best way to enjoy items as they were served. We ordered 5 items to share.First to come out was the kale fattoush salad and the beef fried kibbeh. I was underwhelmed by the salad; it was buried under a heavy layer of toasted pita chips, and the acidic tartness of the sumac lemon vinaigrette completely overpowered the greens. One the other hand, the kibbeh was pretty good. Lauren suggested we open the kibbeh and pour the yogurt inside, something I had never tried before. This turned out to be a revelation, as getting the yogurt directly on the perfectly seasoned beef and pine nut mixture truly enhanced the item. This is the only way I'll ever eat kibbeh again.Next came the kafta, veal bacon sandwiches, and the charred brussels sprouts. The kafta, ground meat and lamb shaped like sausage links, came with an incredible garlic whip and ratatouille.  The ratatouille was a little bland, but the garlic whip was exceptional. The meat paired well with this delightful dip. The veal bacon item, which Lauren described as Ilili's answer to the pork bun, was the highlight of the meal. The veal bacon was sandwiched with pickled vegetables on what appeared to be mini pancakes. We devoured these in short order. The brussels were fine, but not exceptional. They were topped with sliced grapes; I think the idea is for the sweetness of the grapes to balance the charred brussels. Seems like I good idea on paper, but it just didn't work for me. Overall, I enjoyed my time at Ilili. The food was pretty good overall, and the service was outstanding. If not for the initial wait and the horrible table, I might be describing a five-star, rather than a four-star, experience.",0,0,0,Graham B.,"Alexandria, VA",188,105,1

Part of my dinner with a friend included the best cauliflower either of us had ever experienced, along with some good crispy duck. We tried the mixed meats for two, which had a lot of food by upscale dining standards. The meats were, well, mixed. The beef and kefka (lamb) were good, while the chicken was just so-so. Be forewarned that the garlic whips have a lot of garlic, overwhelming other flavors.There are a few obstacles preventing this place from excellent meal status, noise and service. We went for an early dinner seating, around 6 PM, but still had slow food delivery. The place also got noisy quickly. I understand that tables need to be closer together in Manhattan than in a place with cheap land like Athens Georgia, but sound deadening materials would make the place more romantic and less corporate.

3.0,3/23/2015,"ilili is one of those restaurants where you go in, expecting to be whisked off your feet and suckered into paying a ritualistic homage more frequently than your other favorite go-to spots would like. Ambiance is great, perfect balance between casual and classy. The dimly lit dining rooms are cozy, and the mirrored room lends itself to more intimate conversations than the main. Service is impeccable, but the food falls short of impressive.The labne lacks complexity. Tangy, and served with warm pita, I held it to my previous experiences with the mezze, and I was underwhelmed. It does however, provide a light, refreshing palate break between dishes. The kafta plate was my least favorite part of the meal. While the ratatouille was delicious both visually and in the literal sense, the meat was so overcooked and dry, and the seasoning left much to be desired. The rest of the dish was mediocre both in presentation and flavor.The duck schwarma is tasty, but lacks inherent gaminess due to the fig jam. Perhaps this is just a personal pet peeve, but contents of my schwarma fell out because it was so loosely wrapped.Kibbeh Bi Laban, or ""dumplings"" as our server suggested to us, was a happy addition to our meal. Warm, creamy yogurt provides an ample swimming pool for small stuffed beef meatballs. The dish was missing a carb element... as I had discovered the next day while plopping it into a bed of dirty rice. Brussel sprouts were a stand alone dish. All the different nuances in flavor brought together worked so well, that I had only hoped that the other dishes could have been just as outstanding. Phoenician fries are a no-brainer as well. Unless you don't like salt, and seasoned fried potatoes, order the fries. Messing that up would be sacrilege to the tater gods. As wonderful as these two dishes were, it doesn't warrant a revisit any time soon.",1,1,1,Michelle L.,"Manhattan, NY",173,29,6

Nothing to write about here.- FATTOUSH: This salad was like a Caesar salad with toasted pita replacing croutons, and a lemon vinagrette replacing the Caesar dressing. Why am I comparing it to Caesar salad if there really aren't that many similarities? Because it was that boring.- BRUSSELS SPROUTS: The fig jam and grapes definitely made these Brussels sprouts sweeter than your average roasted Brussels sprouts. This over-sweetening made this vegetable dish sickening after awhile.~ CHICKEN KABOB: Covered with mixed greens and sitting under a beet puree, I had high hopes for the white chicken kabobs. However, they really didn't have much flavor and really lacked a kick. It was just chicken with greens, but presented on a stick.Red wine sangria: Forget the sangria. This was a Cabernet with cut fruit floating on top.SERVICEAmazing service throughout the night. Our waters were never empty, our server made sure that we were taken care of and had enough to eat, and was never intrusive.*Suggestion: The area where we were sitting near the back corner of the restaurant was VERY dimly lit.

A lot of my friends are in the restaurant industry and have come here on my recommendation. Today was different though. We came for the branzini that was on the menu. It was $29. When i got there they told me that they didn't have that fish anymore but had something very similar. The price of this other fish was not mentioned. We ordered it and it was good but when the bill come the fish they switched the $29 branzini was 80 dollars. I felt like this restaurant stole from me. I recommend this place always but how can i do it now when i was baited and switched.,6,1,1,Marc L.,"Brooklyn, NY",47,5,0
5.0,3/15/2015,"ilili is, I believe, one of the few restaurants that embody what Restaurant Week was supposed to be in the first place - for the diner, it's a way of experiencing new restaurants in a more cost-efficient manner and for the establishment, it's a way to reel in new customers by highlighting the specialties of your restaurant. While almost all participating restaurants fall (very) short, ilili truly takes to heart the purpose and goals of Restaurant Week and now, I've already made an upcoming reservation to take my friends because I had such an awesome time.One of my major peeves about RW offers is the limited menus that don't let you experience what is so great about the restaurant in the first place, completely negating the purpose of the event. ilili lets you choose 2 starters, one entree and one dessert. The selection list is a great sample of their full menu so if you come with a group of people, you'll be able to try a bit of everything. This was exactly what my friends and I did and I'd highly recommend doing the same as EVERYTHING is DELICIOUS!The entrees are regular size and you are guaranteed to leave stuffed to the face. We ordered the lamb shank, scallops and lamb chops and kabobs. While the lamb chops were an additional $10 (?), I would recommend it again and again and again. They were divine. Anyone who loves lamb will appreciate this dish and anyone who has never had lamb will easily be converted. Yea, that good.But if for any strange reason you are unhappy, well, get this - you get unlimited complimentary pita bread. That's right. It's warm, it's soft, it's aromatic - AND it's free. I think I just died and went to carb heaven (*angels singing in the background*).Finally, I have to highlight their service. I would give just 5 stars for that. We were helped by April and let me tell you, this woman is good at her job. She was by far the best server I have ever had. Everything she did was just right - fast but not rushed, attentive but not annoying, helpful but not sales-y. All her recommendations were spot on!Now I fully understand why after 1400+ reviews, ilili has maintained a solid 4 full stars. ilili defines what a great restaurant should be and I truly believe all restaurants can learn something or another from it.",3,1,2,Salina H.,"New York, NY",27,122,0

The restaurant has a bar area and a separate dining area. They have happy hour, which i would love to try another time. Our waiter was attentive and knowledgeable of the food that ilili had to offer. We had the duck shwarma, brussel  sprouts, steak tartar (sadly they ran out of the tuna tartar), and the mixed grill to share amongst 3 girls and by the end of the night we were stuffed! My favorite dish was the brussel sprouts, it was amazing. Everything else was nothing out of the ordinary for the price. Our appetizers came out wayyyy before the mixed grill and fries so we were filling our stomach with the free pita bread and wine so by the time the mixed grill came out we were too full to finish it. I wished they had either brought out the appetizers later or the main dish earlier...We wanted to try the dessert but our stomachs couldn't take anymore. lolMy overall experience was mediocre.

Definitely try the duck shwarma and the brussel sprouts. These two go well with everything and are amazing. Do not get the steak tartar! It is not the best thing on the menu. We filled up our stomach with the complimentary hummus appetizer and did not finish all the food we ordered and also had to give up on ordering dessert.

There is a large lounge to the right when you walk in where you can grab a drink while you wait for your party to arrive. I love the ambience. Even though it is big, it's quite intimate. The next room has large round tables perfect for parties. The room past it has tables for two that are perfect for date night. Or in my case ""catch up with your brother night"". Now for the best part- the food! My brother is vegetarian, and quite picky. He tried and loved everything! We ordered hummus with pine nuts, which to me was just like any other hummus. He ate it all so that was fine. We also ordered Brussels sprouts, and eggplant. These dishes were unique and what in my opinion made the meal. You MUST order these. My brother hates eggplant and he loved it here! Lastly, we ordered risotto as part of our meal. It was good, but not as amazing as the Brussels sprouts. It needed more vegetables I think. For dessert we ordered the chocolate soufflé. I am a soufflé obsessed person so naturally I would not let the server poke a hole in the top and pour the hazelnut over it. So I can't comment on that, but without the sauce it was phenomenal. Finally, I had wine during our meal- Argentine Malbec- excellent. My brother had several cups of coffee.

Several of the first-visit standouts: falafel, cauliflower, eggplant, hummus, and tabbouleh I ordered again, as well as some Brussel sprouts. The cauliflower, while outstanding, was definitely prepared differently. I remember a small bowl filled with this amazing roasted cauliflower, rather than a plate with only four florets sitting in a pool of tahini. The falafel was uncommonly shaped and delicious, exactly as I'd remembered. The eggplant, which was my absolute favorite menu item, almost made me ill this time around. It was prepared with tomato, scallions, and a sickening amount of tamarind molasses. The Brussels sprouts were delightful and are probably my new favorite menu item; roasted and served with grapes, fig jam, walnuts and mint yogurt. If you're planning on a dessert, I recommend the Ilili Candy Bar.

First of all he was just the right amount of attentive and very knowledgeable about the menu, and forthcoming with his honest and spot on recommendations regarding the food. Out of all the RW places that I've tried this place stood out by the generous portion sizes, you get two appetizers, entrée and dessert. Between the three of us we had six appetizers! I won't even attempt to write down the names of everything we ate but the absolute highlights of our wonderful meal were the hummus with pine nuts, steak tartar, eggplant appetizer but my absolute favorite was the chicken liver. These were not your usual chicken livers, they were cooked in a pomegranate sauce and just tasted beyond delicious!! I got the Scottish salmon as my main course and it was paired perfectly with quinoa. I tried my friend's lamb Makloubeh and it was super tender and delicious. I was seriously so stuffed from overeating but everything that we ordered was so tasty that I had force myself to keep eating!

4.0,3/5/2015,"If you go for restaurant week be prepared to eat A LOT. Also be open to trying something new - you'll definitely have a great experience if you listen to your waiter's suggestions and take advantage of the amazing options they have. It's not your normal set-up because you actually get two appetizers each plus a main course & dessert... I went with two friends on a Wednesday night so it was not that crowded. The feel is somewhere between casual and fancy, but I didn't feel out of place coming straight from work in rain boots. It looks like a good place for an intimate dinner with friends or a date. The front area by the bar and the lounge tables also looks great for happy hour and catching up with friends - there weren't that many people there, and I could definitely see myself coming back to grab a drink. We were seated in the dimly-lit dining room in the back and were greeted by SUCH a friendly staff. Our waiter walked us through the entire menu, noting the differences between the restaurant week menu and the normal menu, and basically told us exactly what to get, which was amazing with so many options to choose from.From a drink standpoint, I highly recommend the Fresh Meadow. It's a gin drink with cucumber water so it's extremely refreshing. The drinks are super pricey, though so be prepared for that (they also have a non-alcoholic version of the drink so you can get the refreshment without the buzz). Ok here's the rundown of our first-course experience:Hummus - definitely get with pine nuts. It's an unbelievable dish and pairs perfectly with the other items to scoop up with the pita. Definitely my favorite thing on the menu.Kale Fattoush - it's your typical kale salad but comes in a decently-sized portion to share with 3 or 4 people. Kibbe Naye Beirutieh - this one was definitely something I had to be convinced to try but it was actually pretty tasty with the pita and the feta! It's pretty small so if everyone at your table wants to try it, I suggest getting 2.Chankleesh - Your waiter should prepare this one for you with the olive oil - it's a decently sized portion, and we definitely had a lot left over. It's feta like you've never tried it before, and I highly suggest pairing with the hummus and the meat dishes.Moussaka - This eggplant dish also has a great dipping sauce for the pita (clearly I have a pita problem). One of my friends pointed out that it has kind of a honey aftertaste, which is definitely true. Chicken Livers - Yes this looks like a weird thing to get but it was one of our favorites! It's one of the only hot appetizers and pairs super well with everything else. The dipping sauce is great, and it comes in a pretty large portion, so very easy to share.For my main course I got the lamb, which was highly recommended by the waiter. I was pretty full after the appetizer portion, so it was hard to get through, but I liked it. It's not your typical lamb dish - the sauce definitely takes some getting used to - but I do recommend it. I don't know if I'd necessarily order it again if I went back, because the way it was prepared is not for me, but if you're going to Ilili for the first time, you definitely have to try it. The good thing about this dish is that you get a side of cucumber yogurt, which really hits the spot after all the heavy food you just ate. Huge plus, and again.... great for dipping. Finally, you can't go wrong with the desserts. Thank god they are in small portions so you can actually enjoy them without worrying about how in the world you are going to finish them. Between the three of us we got 2 Ilili candy bars and one cheese cake. The candy bar was my favorite - it tasted like some kind of gourmet Snickers bar made with homemade dark chocolate ganache. Absolutely unreal. Overall, it's a must-try. I don't know if I'd 100% go back for a large dinner because it's pretty pricey and it's not my cup of tea to pay that much for food I don't know that I'm 100% going to like, but if you're adventurous and don't mind spending a little, I give it a hard yes. Also, as I said before, the lounge area in the front which serves happy hour looks super casual and fun for a quick drink",1,0,0,Emily P.,"La Jolla, San Diego, CA",225,209,31

So glad we chose this place. We went here pretty late. Had a reservation for 9:30. Despite that, the place was still relatively packed. We got our table around 9:45 and were greeted by our very attentive server. She was very friendly and explained the menu in great detail - as it was our first time there.We both got to choose from an array of delicious food. Two appetizers, one entree, and one dessert PER PERSON. So you definitely get your money's worth. For appetizers, we ordered: Hummus - So good and is served with puffy, freshly made pita bread (free refills!).Fattoush - Kale salad with this amazing lemon vinaigrette. Falafel - Cooked to perfection. Seriously. I don't know how they got it to be in a perfect rectangular shape and have it be so crispy on the outside yet so soft on the inside. Chankleesh - The best appetizer we ordered. Feta cheese with onions, tomatoes, and zaatar (no idea what that is). Either way, it was the best blend of everything and tasted like heaven. For our entrees, we ordered the Lamb Makloubeh and the Scottish Salmon.Lamb Makloubeh - Everything I imagined it to be. Tasteful, tender lamb tossed with rice, eggplant, and nuts. The lamb was so good that I kept picking it out of the dish and disregarding the rest. Very delicious and definitely worth a try. Scottish Salmon - Tenderly cooked salmon with quinoa amongst other things in a delicious sauce. Didn't disappoint. Last, but not least, dessert! My favorite. Ilili Candy Bar - I am so glad we ordered this. I might go back just so I can get this again. This yummy candy bar made with chocolate ganache, fig caramel, dulce de leche and pistachios. It was such a yummy treat. My friend and I were fighting each other for the last bite! Ashta - Light, soft, and creamy. Unlike anything I've tried before. Served on a plate with rose syrup.

3.0,3/3/2015,"I am Lebanese(born there not from origins and spent 25 years back home). Been in the states for 5years so not a new guy) and passed by a lebanese restaurant.Well i will start with some positive feedback as you know by now that the list of negatives will be a bit longer.Food presentation is good. Chicken livers was delicious compared to all meals/plates that we have ordered. Would like to add that the servers has high work ethic and they are very professional, someone wont doubt as ilili is considered a fine dining restaurant. I will try to be precise in each negative feedback:Chairs: not sure where they came up with it as it reminds me of the ones which we used to sit down when getting some gov. paper work done.I am not sure whether such a restaurant should have such a setup. I would like to add that the general design is not something that would reflect the lebanese culture. I understand if the wood is called"" cedars"" but i doubt that it is from lebanon.Waiting time: it took 40minutes to get our appetizers. We have ordered more as the portions were too small.( The kibbeh nayeh, is as if someone is cursing you before eating it because of how small it is. Keep the same shape but with larger quantity as it is not costing you much to make it. Selling it for 12 bucks where it costs 1.5 max. Understood that it is on 5th av but i felt that it is a ripoff).After ordering 11 appetizers we had to re-order two more. Main course waiting time: another 30minutes for the main course so we were full already. This is not ethical as we have already ordered the food so it is a must to eat.Desert: we were 4 and two of us ordered kneife as well as ashta. Kneife is for 18 bucks. Wake up people, go to Naya or any other restaurant and you will get it for maybe 10max. ( know why, again it is on 5th.).Price: 400 bucks for lebanese food is like you are telling a lebanese guy that you are committing suicide. It is not because i am lebanese, but since i know how the food is prepared and that all people shouldnt get such a ripoff. Mhanna is a restaurant in lebanon where one would think that he is an emperor because of how they treat him as well as the quality of food and generosity. ( if you are the owner or an investor in ilili, keep in mind that i am not those snobby people with the bentley who goes there, i am just a regular guy who works hard to get to the top level).Per person for Mhanna: 80bucks max including one bottle of whisky and you will be astonished with the servers as well as the generosity.( understood you are on 5th and trying to make it american lebanese ""3al amerkeineh"". I am not a big fan of totally changing your identity. Adding two photos of lebanon and beirut(which i didnt see) will mean a lot to us.Naya express and restaurant is much way better as they have the lebanese ambiance from the smell of their food and they are not pricey compared to all other fine dining lebanese restaurants.In the end i wish ilili all the best but i am not sure where is the lebanese representation and i am a person whose so logical that i thought of trying it to get the experience.No one can say anything on the quality of food but you can say a lot about other stuff.In my opinion, what can be worked at is the waiting time as a lot of people are getting frustrated.

4.0,2/22/2015,"I always want to try out restaurant with food that I am not familiar with during restaurant week since it provides a prix fixed menu but can still choose within a number of selections. Had a great time there. The restaurant is really spacious and has coat check at the entrance. It has a bar and a dining area separately. I made a reservation and so I was able to skip the line. The food was great and worth the price as for a $38 dinner you can choose 2 appetizers, 1 main course, and 1 dessert. You can always share it with others so that you can taste a more variety of food. The Kale fattoush was just a salad with lemon and vinegar I think. Nothing creamy like salad dressing there. Go for it if you want something light to start your meal. The moussaka was special with very delicate looking. It is a cold dish made with eggplant. Both my friend and I ordered lamb makloubeh for entree and we really liked it. It was a mixture with lamb, eggplant, cashew nuts on dirty rice. The lamb was not overcooked at all. The Ilili candy bar was okay and it gives us a little bit surprise since it has a crispy layer in between. Otherwise, it is just a normal chocolate cake... But I really LOVE the ashta. It looks like a scoop of icecream but I have to say it is not that sweet. It has a little bit of special smell with seasonal fruit on top. The dressing was fantastic. I think i have only tried something similar before at an indian restaurant but this one is definitely more delicate and delicious. I think this is one of the MUSTHAVE if you always eager to try something new. The only thing was that the light was a little bit dim and I always prefer eating at a brighter area. That's just a personal preference and overall I feel this place is definitely worth trying.",1,0,1,Haibei J.,"Manhattan, NY",225,13,86

They have a ton of big tables, a mezze menu that's perfect for sharing, and service that was friendly and accommodating. (Our server, Billy, was fabulous--fun, knowledgeable, super helpful with menu recommendations--props to Billy!)I went with a party of 5, and we chose to order the 10 mezze dishes that didn't have an additional supplemental charge. Had we splurged, I would definitely recommend the tuna tartar, other tables were raving. Favorites out of the dishes we ordered were:- hummus with basterma (the smoked meat adds an awesome flavor rush)- chankleesh feta cheese dish (creamy and perfectly spiced)- arnabeet mekle cauliflower (this was a fave, great combo of mint and chili powder, very unique!)- Moujadara, a lentil purée, great texture flavorThe mains were standard, we were satisfied but not floored away. The risotto was a sleeper surprise, really good and a great vegetarian option.

Though it was restaurant week, the portions were incredibly generous.2. Our server (April) was wonderful. Incredibly knowledgable and passionate. We wanted to invite her to pull up a chair and join us.3. Highly recommend the kale salad (so fresh tasting), steak tartare, and feta appetizer (my friend had the last 2 and shared). The lamb with fried eggplant was incredible.4. That candy bar. oh. my. god.5. Though a noisy space, it was a great place to catch up with 3 of my best friends. We were not at all rushed.My only complaint: the runners seemed a little overwhelmed - even though there seemed to be a lot of staff. They were supposed to do some table-side prep of some of the dishes, and did not (our server apologized and did it for us). When they put down my salad, the guy's fingers were definitely in my dish (which I know is hard to avoid, but is still kind of gross, so I just avoided that part of the salad).",2,0,1,Alisa K.,"New York, NY",5,16,0

The place was packed for the evening, with every table in use. Even at maximum capacity, however, the food was excellent, service was balanced, attentive but not intrusive and appropriate. The bar area is swanky. The upstairs room we dined in felt cozy and romantic. The kitchen did a nice job adjusting the set menu slightly for the gluten free pescatarian in our couple, leaving both of us very satisfied.

The specialty drinks menu had a bit of whimsy in it; it would be fun to work one's way through the list.As others have noted, Ilili is not inexpensive.

She was very cold.  Her job isn't that hard, great, seat, answer phones --I had this job for years, she needs to be re-trained.   The manager was running around and didn't seem to say anything to us either --felt ignored for the first 10 minutes we were there.  Had a reservation, but still had to wait a good 15 minutes to be sat, and then they sat us in horrible seats at the front of the restaurant.

4.0,1/31/2015,"Ilili immediately reminds me of Layla, long extinct from the Tribeca restaurant scene.  Dissimilar-looking cousins--Ilili and Layla--but both pioneered the 'trendy Middle Eastern restaurant experience' in New York--disproving the oxymoron in ways that Al Bustan or Almayass neither attempt to do, nor succeed in serendipitously doing.The playing field at Ilili is massive.  You enter the lounge and bar area that triples up as a waiting area for the main dining space as well as a space for a light dinner option.  The drinks are fashionably named, even if not as palindromes, and are generally good.  Service in the lounge is enthusiastic and responsive.The main dining area is complemented by other rooms on the first floor and upstairs.  The noise level is tolerable.  Back in the day, when Ilili opened, it was an unusually hip place for having a quiet meal.  Not so anymore--expect crowds on most days and nights.  The good news is that the menu has gained in variety over the years, without compromising on quality, although there could be the occasional disappointment.  The mezze selection is extensive.  I generally get some combination of the hummus, baba ghannouj, mouhamara, falafel, and kale fattoush.  But the star is the batata harra--cubed potato with pepper and coriander.  I could make a dinner out of just three servings of batata harra--not what your nutritionist would recommend, but certainly a good alternative option for my 'last meal' in my Yelp profile.  Most times I have been here, with multiple mezze dishes, I have not been able to enjoy the main plates.  I should however put in a good word for their vegetable risotto.  Leave room though for some Lebanese ice cream and the mixed baklava.Ilili will continue to be my favorite sit-down Middle Eastern dining option in New York.  Unless someone was able to replicate the experience closer to where I live.",11,8,9,Srini V.,"Manhattan, NY",467,463,97

Attentive, helpful service - you got it.Now to the important stuff... FOOD. I'll start of by saying I was eating here with a middle easterner. Aka: we had high standards. And impressively, ilili was the first middle eastern restaurant in the US to blow us away.The highlight by far was the unbelievable warm eggplant. I can't even put it to words it was so magical. I don't even LIKE eggplant, and I could live off of ilili's version. All of the other appetizers we ordered were also delish and took their namesakes up a notch in flavor and presentation. For our main, we shared the duck shawarma which was super interesting what with pomegranate seeds and awesome crispy duck. We also got a side of Phoenician fries which were good, but if you're a crispy fry lover like myself, you may find them a little on the soggy side.We also got two cocktails - the Phoenician lemonade and From Beirut With Passion. Both were without a doubt two of the best cocktails we've ever had. If you prefer things on the sweeter, less alcoholic side as we do, you'll be very pleased. Thank goodness we don't live in New York as drinks like these would turn us into alcoholics.All in all, ilili was not only de-ilili-cious, but easy to book, beautiful to eat in, and topped off with fine service.

It's trendy, romantic, fun, and the decor is beautiful. I went for dinner last night with 3 friends and we were blown away with our experience. I was the first one in my party to arrive and as soon as I sat down, both the food and drink menus were on the table. The waitress came over within minutes of sitting down asking if I want a drink. As each one of my friends arrived, the waitress immediately came over to them taking their drink orders as well. She was extremely friendly and patient with all of our questions! Our drinks came out in no time and throughout the entire evening our waitress was exceptionally attentive, asking if we'd like a 2nd drink as soon as we each finished our 1st. She answered all the questions we had about the food and drink options and made excellent recommendations, as we went with most of them (we all shared a bunch of small plates). We all LOVED the brussel sprouts and hummus, in fact we needed 2 orders of each of those since we couldn't get enough. We tried the truffle duck egg plate based on our waitresses suggestion (although we were a little hesitant at first) but we were glad we did, it was rich, but the taste of all the ingredients went together so well, and was great with the soft, fresh, pita bread they serve. I also should note the duck shwarma was one of my favorites as well. My friend made one comment about the hummus having a little more oil than she preferred, and the bus boy overheard, so he apologized and brought over a new one without oil within 30 seconds! Service this good is hard to find, in fact I'd say its the best service I've ever experienced! After dinner we tried the candy bar dessert, I was so full i didn't know if i would fully appreciate the dessert, but WOW!

The za'atar eggs arrived tepid on a somewhat tough English muffin (unless it was a bagel, I couldn't even tell!) and the truffled one had a sauce that was just too sickeningly fatty. The sumac fries here are great but for most of the year you can just get them down the road - on the street- at the Ilili box kiosk in front of the flatiron with the same dip and dressing. The dessert was ambitious (gastronomically speaking), complicated (I liked asking a friendly staff member to deconstruct all the elements) but in the end not entirely successful in terms of how it tasted (the pistachio cake element is all style with its airy puffiness but tastes like factory made plastic covered asian grocery store cake). But, this part I don't have too much problem with because if the chef's going on a limb trying something magnificently different (sphericalized pear bubbles, dehydrated brown butter etc) then I'm willing to risk not liking it.

The cubed falafel (which is just weird, mmmkay?) was missing that essential element of falafel goodness that 90% of middle eastern truck food guys can deliver with no problem -- the middle part!!! You know, there was just too much crunch, not enough chickpea going on. The chicken livers topped with molasses and lemon did not work at all. Made me sad for the nicely prepared livers to be coated in such an unpalatable combo. The beef Kibbeh, every time I bit into it, generated unwelcome memories of White Castle (don't get me wrong...I love White Castle. But not when I'm spending illilli money for something that hits the same flavor profile!) I guess the coup de gras was the simplest thing, though -- the pita and hummus. Both were as uninteresting and run of the mill as one can expect. The pita were kinda stiff and boring, and the hummus -- well, it was just there.

Our server was friendly and recommended numerous great dishes for sharing as the menu can be a bit overwhelming with so many items to choose from. Of the many dishes we devoured, the brussel sprouts will forever stand out in my mind as probably THE BEST sprouts I've yet to tantalize my tastebuds with. The combination of the sprouts mixed with the sweetness of the fig jam along with the creaminess of the greek yogurt and the crunchiness from the walnuts creates a mindblowing explosion in your mouth. If there is ONLY one thing you can order from here for whatever reason, do yourself a favor and indulge in the brussels! We also ordered the Phoenician fries as many Yelpers had recommended this as one of the better sides. I was expecting to be blown away with all the hype from other reviews but was a bit disappointed as they were served on the softer side. I personally like to have some crisp and crunch with my fries but that's just a personal preference. The flavor was great and the dipping sauce that accompanied it was just as great as well. It was definitely worth trying.Also, if you're dining here with a group, the mixed platter makes a good choice for sharing as it allows you to sample the various meat dishes including the Kefta and Lamb Chops!

Their mezza (small bite) plates are my absolute favorite so I always end up ordering 4-6 plates to share for a group of 2-3 and we're always satisfied.I've loved everything but I have to bow down to their duck shawarma which is to die for, their Phoenician fries with fig garlic dip (even though the name is a bit offensive to Lebanese people who love their Arabic background), kibe naye (meat tartare so it's definitely an acquired taste) and their veal bacon wraps. Sometimes, Ilili has a stand at Madison Square Eats from time to time and I LOVE going there to grab lunch. So why do you ask I give this place a 4 star? It's because I ALWAYS have to wait 30+ minutes regardless of what time my reservation is or how busy the place seems. I just hate the wait.

Tried a glass of Château Musar Jeune Blanc which is a white from Lebanon. Although the country is not really known for wines (like France or Spain or Italy is) it was balanced well and had ""legs"". The WINOS will understand what I mean. I will definitely be going back for drinks. ""Beirut with passion""?

Low lighting and the music is playing at a level where you can hear the conversations around you. Bar area with a bunch of low bench like seats at the entrance and this is where you will/can sit while waiting for your table. The waitress will take your drink order while you wait ($17 for margarita with Patron and $14 for Grey Goose vodka with cranberry).  After roughly a 10 min wait we were seated towards the back where the tables for two seemed to be located. Before I forget, people were eating on the low seating area at the entrance but not sure if it was just appetizers or actual meals because they didn't have reservations. Now back to the meal. The seating was close but that is to be expected in NYC. You can literally be in the conversation next to you if you aren't having your own. We went with the mixed grill, Phoenician fries, Brussels spouts, falafel and a salad. Just enough for two people to get full. Everything was great. My wife didn't care for the lamb chops, so that was more for me. Add a couple more drinks (Sumac (?) margarita and a couple of 916 pale ales) and the tab came to $192 including tax.

The hummus and cheese dishes seem woefully inadequate when they plop a huge basket of pita bread next to it. However, I do have to admit the Phoenician fries are delicious. For the main course, I had the loup de mer (for two; I shared, obviously) which was fine. Two of my friends had the Mixed Grill for two, which was a ton of meat though taste-wise not overly impressive. Another friend had the scallops, which literally came in four small pieces - do not order. Our group had a negative experience when the waiter dropped and smashed all of our drinks, spilling on my friend's jacket. We weren't charged, of course, and they replaced our drinks (after a somewhat lengthy delay... Actually, in general the service was a bit slow, though it was 9:30pm on a Saturday night) but there was hardly an apology from the waiter.

I know this sounds like the weirdest combination but it really works. My husband who doesn't even like brussel sprouts loves them! -  Falafel- comes in little squares, they are always very crispy and crunchy so if you like softer falafel's then these aren't for you! - Batata Hara- fried spicy potatoes....whats not to love! I always appreciate the fact that after finishing the bowl of potatoes there isn't a little pool of oil at the bottom! - Mouhamara- I personally love this dish due to the sweetness of the pomegranate molasses and will order it wherever I find it! If you don't like sweet dips then I would steer clear, but I feel this is one dip one should definitely try!- Hummus- good hummus, I've had better but this isn't bad in the world of hummus's - Rkaykat- cheese rolls, yum! Fried to crispy perfection and filled with gooey yummy cheese :) - Chicken Shish Taouk- chicken is always tender and juicy! It can get to be an expensive outing here but that's why I called it ""fancy"" Mediterranean. It's a great spot for a date or just out with friends as they have the space.

The standouts were the Duck shwarma, the lamb sausage, the Haloumi, the ilili Candy Bar dessert. Other items were all tasty as well, but not necessarily noteworthy.The atmosphere is modern and unique, with little square partitions surrounding the dining area and bar. Each of the different sized partitions either contained an edison bulb, a mirror or some other depth-of-field altering element producing a unique feeling in the restaurant of not necessarily realizing it's actual size. It felt both intimate and cavernous at the same time.I would go back here on a special occasion, but I found that it was a bit on the pricey side, even for the quality of the cuisine.

I love round tables because it makes it a lot easier for the whole group to speak with each other, and even if not everyone is speaking, at least everyone can see each other, so big plus for round tables.The ambiance is pretty relaxed as well, and the service we had was great. Our waiter was very attentive, and he spent a lot of time guiding us through the menu, helped us order to get the most out of our meal and even helped us with which small dishes work well mixed together to small bites of deliciousness. My personal favorite was actually the chicken liver, it is A MUST TRY, and I promise it is not as scary as it sound. Everything comes out ""family style"" and is meant for sharing, so please please please so yourself a favor and DON'T order two of the same dish.Either way, this place is delicious, my mouth water just thinking about it, so if you are in the mood for a great food experience I would definitely check out ilili!! I know I will be back for more.",2,1,1,Ida Iselin E.,"Oslo, Norway",229,211,126

5.0,9/9/2014,"I came with a friend during Restaurant Week in August and this place knocked my socks off. Hummus doesn't get creamier than this; we both wanted to just bury ourselves face first in a giant bowl of the stuff and be done with it. But if we had, we would've missed out on the Brussels sprouts mixed with All Manner of Yummy Things (which *two* of my friends insisted I try if I ever made it to ilili) and the pièce de résistance, my lovely, lovely boneless ribeye, cooked to medium-rare perfection, may it rest in peace. I went all in on all 12 ounces of it (I'm, uh, anemic, I need the iron), pairing each succulent bite with those sinfully crave-worthy crispy gnocchi and a bit of roasted tomato, for extra moisture and flavor. I was so enraptured with my steak that I didn't even get around to trying my friend's lamb -- and I am a shameless lover of our woolly little friends (they're cute AND delicious!). Let's see -- we also ate lots of other deliciousness: some palate-pleasing kale concoction, square falafel, crispy on the outside, fluffy on the inside (does a different shape enhance the flavor?!). The strawberry rhubarb cheesecake was SO good and complex, the perfect balance of sweetness and richness and just the right size. I only had one cocktail, whose name I cannot recall, but I think it had something to do with a meadow, and it was light and refreshing and not strong at all and the hills might have been alive with the sound of music, but I digress because let's face it, this night was all about the food. Perhaps my favorite takeaway was that the meal didn't feel like a throwaway Restaurant Week menu. The only thing we ordered that wasn't on the RW menu was los sprouts and our table was truly an embarrassment of riches. It's good to be in the First World. Also, our waitress was ON POINT. Attentive and helpful and super knowledgeable but not overbearing. As if the stellar food isn't enough, ilili is also a beautiful, classy, ambient space filled with good-looking, well-dressed people.

2.0,8/25/2014,"I definitely have experienced better Mediterranean food.  The food is extremely overpriced and not worth it in the end.  We ordered the hummus, falafels , risotto and gnocchi.  The selection of wine was not great either. What kind of ""high end"" restaurant offers a cheap bottle of Beringers?  They also had the audacity to charge $50 for it.  I have been to many 4-5 star restaurants and they would be embarrassed to do that.  The gnocchi were too mushy and covered in this white froth that looked like fluff.  The risotto was simple, but not satisfying.  The hummus was just OK.  A true Mediterranean restaurant would have warmed it, not just put it on a shallow dish.  The falafels were probably the best thing we had, but nothing to rush back there for.The service wasn't great either.  The waitress was VERY pushy.  I really don't like that when I dine.  Let me decide what I want and if I have questions I will ask you.   She was also rather snobby and didn't make us very comfortable.Last, I have to add that the manager embarrassed me in front of the bar area if front of other patrons.  I don't want to get into why, as it was embarrassing enough when it happened.  But, let's just say that the waitress sent him over to basically ask me why I didn't leave her a high tip.

5.0,8/24/2014,"Came here on a Saturday night 'cause I thought Sat dinner was part of NYC Restaurant Week. Little did I know, it's not. So, instead of getting anything from their main courses, I chose to get a bunch of appetizers :) And I'm glad I did so. The waitress was extremely helpful in helping my friend and I figure out what to order. She recommended the Moujadara dip, the duck schwarma, and the veal thing (forget the name). So, I ordered all of those + a warm eggplant dish. 4 appetizers for 2 people was more than enough -- especially with the free bread.The pita bread that they gave us was really soft and good, as was the yogurt dip. Don't forget that you can get refills on the bread! Of everything that we ordered, my favorite was the veal dish. It was so flavorful and juicy and I just about cried when I had my last bite. I was honestly never a big fan of Mediterranean food, but this place let me give it another chance. Also, check out the bathroom.

4.0,8/17/2014,"This is the best NYC Restaurant Week experience I've had so far (dating back to 2012). The restaurant is much bigger inside than you'd expect from looking at its storefront. You enter through the bar and lounge, then you get to the main dining hall. There is also a dining area upstairs with a small bar. Dim lighting. Faint mirror walls. Shiny leather chairs and red tablecloths. Dress to impress. Handsome staff. Snob? Yeah a bit. Background music and chatter amplified by the high ceilings. Ambiance - it's all about it.The experience of sitting in such an ambient space precedes the food. You get to choose two appetizers which is a delightful difference from most restaurant week menus. The appetizers and entrees are about the same size - just so you adjust your expectations. The perk of dining in a group is that I get to sample a variety of plates. AppetizersKale Fattoush - it's a BIG, delicious salad. Kale, pita, tomatoes, lemon vinaigrette. Lebanese style. Kibbe - aka steak tartar. Burghul (high fiber, protein as a Middle Eastern staple), onion, mint. Refreshing flavor. Done right.Hommus, Mouhamara, Falafel, Moujadara - let's sum it up - they were all good! EntreesBranzino - filleted, very small portioned, good for light mealLamb and its side of cucumber yogurt was the scene stealer. Wow.I wasn't a fan of the restaurant week crowd, noise, and flashy cameras (the dark lighting here is far from ideal for food porn or selfies).

5.0,8/12/2014,"For Restaurant Week, my lab members and I were able to enjoy what we all agreed was one of the most incredible meals we've had.  The waiter who served us was personable, friendly, and candid about his suggestions for our ordering.  He introduced to us from the outset the Lebanese cultural norm of the sharing and melding together of appetizers, and even moved us to a smaller table so that our group of 5 would be able to reach for other dishes easily.  We ordered all ten of the appetizers, as each person gets 2, but skipped out on the chicken livers.  The pita bread they brought out was pillowy and had a slight wafting scent of cinnamon.  The textures and the flavors of the appetizers mixed together perfectly; they each tasted wonderful on their own, but are all truly meant to be combined.  Our waiter took his time to explain to us each of the dishes, and showed us how best to eat it.Every one of us ordered the lamb, and mutually deemed it the best, most tender lamb we had ever tried.  The dish is served with a cucumber yogurt that compliments the savoriness well.  A few of us couldn't even finish it, and the staff there are more than welcome to wrap up leftovers to go (believing, thankfully, that not a scrap should go to waste).The variety of delicious desserts matched the wide selection of appetizers, and each one was memorable.  I would order the ""candy bar"" again, as well as the dessert--the obscure name of which I cannot recall--that was soaked in rose water, drizzled with honey, filled (surprisingly) with a soft, light cheese, and served with tiny sesame pocket pita bread.  Overall, the splurge is most definitely worth it.  The atmosphere is posh and architecturally interesting; dozens of mirrors reflected the warm, amber glow of the lighting.  Though I hold limited restaurant experience, I will say that this is the best dining experience I've ever had (with great people, to boot).  Highly recommended!",1,0,0,Josephine M.,"Egg Harbor Township, NJ",9,6,0

Ilili does have a gorgeous lounge and bar area in which you can dine in. The main dining room is right behind the lounge separated by a beautiful wall divider.  They do play loud music but that makes the environment much more fun. My first dining experience here was for my birthday dinner for a party of 15. I know how big parties can be a hassle sometimes but the staff took care of us and had everything under control. I ordered the mixed grilled that serves two. It comes with chicken shush taouk, beef kebab, and kafta lamp chops. It was alllllll so good. They were all very juicy and tender. The protein all tasted different because of the different spices they used but it was all so delicious. The waiter came out with the Lebanese Ice cream and sang a birthday song. I've really never had ice cream that smelled, looked, and tasted so good.The second time I came, I ordered Brussels sprouts and tabbouleh for appetizer.I ordered the mixed grill again because I couldn't decide which protein I wanted and I  remembered they were all so good! The waiter asked if I wanted dessert and I declined because I was too full. My date goes, ""you don't want dessert? It's your birthday!"" I said no again because I was too full. The waiter comes back with a baklava and a candle singing happy birthday to me. The waiter was the sweetest! On top of that it was probably one of the best baklava I've had. It was so flaky and it smelled so good!I recently came back for restaurant week with two friends and ilili definitely blew me away again. Each person chooses two appetizers, an entree and dessert. My friends and I all shared the appetizers. For appetizers we ordered hommus, mouhamara (walnuts), kale fattoush (garden salad with kale), kibbe naya beirutieh (steak tartar), moussaka (eggplants), chicken livers. The hommus wasn't bad but it wasn't anything I've never had before so it was nothing special. The kale salad was way too acidic for me but my friends really enjoyed it and the steak tartar also wasn't the best I've had. The mouhamara is a must try!! I'm not a fan of nuts when it comes to eating it with my food but it was so delicious and was more on the sweet side (definitely played in my favor). Moussaka was also really flavorful and yummy. I normally don't like chicken livers because it's really dry but it was so moist and flavorful, I couldn't stop eating it. For entree, I ordered lamb makloubeh (lamb shank). I loved every bite of it. They did garnished it with a lot of fresh scallions on top and I personally don't like scallions. It was no biggie, I scrapped it off my plate and still enjoyed it! My friends ordered scallops and chicken breast. Scallops were cooked to perfection and the chicken was very tender. For dessert, we ordered ilili candy bar, labor cheese cake, and knife nil (cheese tart) in which we all shared. I loved, loved, loved each and everyone of them! The chocolate bar was chocolatey and the spiced pistachio added a nice crunch. It smelled so good, it was like diving into chocolate heaven. The cheese cake was also really delicious. It was the perfect amount of sweetness and so creamy. The cheese tart was different but it was really good. It reminded me of a sugary donut expect inside was filled with cheese. It was crunchy on the outside and warm on the inside. The orange blossom syrup also complimented the cheese tart really well.  The wine here is also superb! If you are a fan of red wine, try Massaya Silver. I was honestly in heaven after the first sip. The aroma and the taste blended so well, it was literally wine orgasm. My waiter Chris suggested Massaya Gold that is only sold by the bottle. My friends didn't want wine so I stuck to Silver  and I enjoyed it a lot. I can imagine how amazing Massaya gold would be already. Honestly, I love ilili and l can't wait to go back! Actually, I think I'll go back tomorrow!",0,0,0,Xiao O.,"New York, NY",229,48,47

But I can still be effusive in my praise. The service is beyond compelling... helpful, warm, not too obtrusive -- never experienced a meal that wasn't completely delightful.  (I have turned this into my ""go to"" spot for special occasions.) MY GOD... who could have imagined roasted brussels sprouts this delicious? (Remember hating them as a kid? If I only had experienced those from Illili!)  How to handle this place? Go with a few others -- a table of four optimal -- and order LOTS and LOTS of the ""small plates."" Even what might read on the menu as ""been there, ate that"" is worth trying. Their unique fusion (French and Lebanese) delivers one savory dish after another.  Try the rock shrimp, the Lebanese traditional salad, the specialty meat dumplings.  I have never had any plate that wasn't excellent. AND, the ambiance is spectacular... a gorgeous dining room -- both the main room with high ceilings and the smaller back room. This one is a WINNER. While a little pricey, well worth the expense.

5.0,7/29/2014,"The restaurant has an interesting Lebanese menu that drew us in.  Reviews on Yelp were overwhelmingly positive, too.  The pita is different, drier, than we've had other places.  There's mint in many menu items, and we did our best to avoid it since it is not to our liking.  Despite the inclusion of mint in the yogurt sauce on the Brussels sprouts, we tried them because of reviews.  They did not disappoint. They were spectacular!  If you like lamb, there are many lamb offerings on the menu. We enjoyed branzino. The baked cheese dessert was delicious, but too filling after a big meal.  I'd recommend it to be shared by at least 4 people since it is such a large portion. It's too tasty and expensive to not finish.The decor is elegant, however people seemed to be dressed however they came off the street. There were sneakers and sandals with shorts and t-shirts.  There were also men in sport coats and women in nice dresses. In other words, anything goes!",0,0,0,Kim P.,"Easton, PA",1,87,12
2.0,7/29/2014,"I came here because of the amount of stars on Yelp and because it was restaurant week, but in all honesty... the food was terrible. Basically, everything was either shiny, dripping or sitting in oil. To be fair, I don't know much about Mediterranean food to know if this is something normal, and the food didn't taste that bad BUT it was so greasy it was similar to eating cheap fast food. The market sandwich I ordered which was veal and bacon between slices of ciabatta bread acted just like pizza would. Oil constantly dripping onto my hands and plate, and face as I ate. Tasted nice, but was all that oil really necessary???Strawberry basil iced tasted like herbal medicine. Green lemonade tasted sweet and like a cucumber? Ehh... The best things I ate there were the phoenician fries and the pita bread. I did not get the chance to try the brussel sprouts which is ilili's best dish.The best dessert I ate there was the strawberry rhubarb cheesecake. Me and my family really didn't like the ilili candy bar, which is weird considering my cousin eats chocolate all the time. I guess it was a little too sweet and chocolatey. Ashta was alright but when the crumbly bits are gone I am just left with spooning blobs of thick, sweet cream into my mouth. I like the friendly servers, I like the casual atmosphere. They didn't have a problem when my aunt brought her baby. The decor is nice. The bathrooms are beautiful. Come to ilili for a casual lunch with friends or your family.

3.0,7/29/2014,"My ilili experience was a solid 3 stars, and would've been 4 if everything weren't so damn expensive. Impressive:- Hummus. Definitely tastes like homemade and we ended up ordering 4 hummus' for a table of 7 because it was so tasty (and the warm, freshly made pita that they kept piling on our table was amazing). - Brussels sprouts and cauliflower. These are the more interesting veggie dishes I've eaten in a long time. But portions are TINY (refer to the unimpressive section below). - The phoenician fries blew my mind. The most amazing, seasoned fries ever. A must try.- The cocktails. An impressive cocktail list and I liked all the drinks I tried, including Fresh Meadow and Strawberry Rhubarb Spritzer.- The ilili candy bar was absolutely incredible. Highly recommend.Unimpressive:- The drink prices. $14+ for a drink at a restaurant? No thanks. I'll happily pay that at a cocktail bar or speakeasy, but not at a restaurant (and I mean, some of these cocktails are not very inspired). Definitely come during happy hour for the cocktails. - The decor. They could've done SO much more with the space. Instead, it felt like one of those ginormous restaurants in Chinatown that is meant to seat as many people as possible, full of huge tables and not much else. It was not creative, sexy, or charming for me. - The portion sizes are TINY. We paid $14 for about 5 cauliflowers? Absurd. - The prices, period. We only ordered appetizers to share, we didn't even order any entrees for sharing.

3.0,7/29/2014,"On Saturday we went to Ilili. It was very silili. The food is hit or miss, and expensive for what it is. To be fair, the brussel sprouts and dandelion greens were incredible. But 3 small scallops for $30? is that supposed to fill us up? Anyway, the cauliflower was not good, my lamb and beef kebabs were ok, and while the risotto and gnocchi seemed to be the largest dishes, they were not much to speak off and would make more sense in a smaller, cosier restaurant at half the price. The waitress started by telling us that it was an alternative eating experience where we just order lots of small plates and larger plates and food keeps on flowing. But then she asked what we wanted for appetizers and a main course, so not that alternative after all. She also mixed up our order, looked angry when we pointed out politely that we had ordered different food, and then disappeared for over half an hour.There seem to be WAY too many people who work there. Most of them have no idea what to do and wander around looking a little confused and a little sheepish.  The architecture is actually very pretty, wood and glass panels everywhere. It feels a little like Inception, like you could turn the whole thing upside down and it would feel the same.I guess if you want to blow money on feeling 'cool' in an 'alternative' Lebanese restaurant, this is a great spot.

It seemed they were trying to push as many people as possible through in the least amount of time and had no concept of enjoying one's meal.  Appetizers were okay, though every dish seemed to include grapes and cheese - very heavy.  Stuffed grape leaves were the smallest I've ever seen and were bitter - soaked in lemon juice.  Entree sizes were huge, but my steak was badly charred on the outside/ barely cooked on the inside and the accompnying potatoes were so salty I could not eat them.  A big plate of Ugh!  The waiter noticed I barely touched my entree - I told him it was pretty bad but I did not want to complain too much in front of a business prospect.  The good news is a manger soon arrived and asked if everything was okay - I politely told him no and he comped the entree.  Other friends have eaten here and liked it, but I think this place may have passed its prime.  The service was average at best, and at the price points they charge you have many other options with much better service and great food.  Ilili is off my list for now.",5,0,0,Joe A.,"Manhattan, NY",0,40,0

This was great, but I'd like to go back with a larger group so we can order and share even more stuff.Everything was good - but the standouts were the Phoenician fries, the cauliflower with tahini labna and especially the melted halumi.

Our waitress greeted us with class and made drink recommendations based off of what we were already drinking.  I salute her for knowing my taste based off of one drink.  When I did end up selecting a drink she asked me if I liked organic, worrying that I wouldn't like it.Tapas style is the name of the game.  We practically ordered the entire menu and would recommend to anyone to try a little of this and that.  To start, our octopus was the best dish on the table.  It's taste and texture melted in our mouths.  The Fattoush is tasty, but nothing special for a Mediterranean restaurant.  Main courses were what the focus was.  All Mixed Grills were cooked full and was seasoned strongly.  If you don't like pepper or a lot of salt I wouldn't recommend getting lamb or beef.  The Bass Bil Hamod was enough for our entire table, but was overcooked and dry.  It's inclusion of bones is knowing, but turned portions of our group off.  I would recommend ordering if you are not familiar with extreme spiced food as it was tame in comparison.Dessert had its ups and downs.  I enjoyed all chocolate dishes, but the sweet cheese melt  I did not.  it's consistency didn't leave me with a good taste.  I would recommend sticking with one or the other.Taste: 3/5Location: 3/5Ambiance: 3/5Experience: 4/5Flavor: 3/5Overall: 3.5/5",0,0,0,Jason T.,"West Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA",609,21,0

5.0,5/16/2014,"Background: Went with 2 others for dinner on a weekday. Ambiance- the place is not very fancy. Regular courteous waiters and the furniture is made of elegant wood and the place itself is well lit. Though the lounge area could be more comfortable. The dishes and utensils were quite regular and didn't create any fancy aura. 3.5/5Service - the waiters were decently informed and educated about the menu. They were prompt for any requests and the timing was also comfortable. 4.5/5Food: We ordered mostly from the appetizers and the eggplant was amazing. So were the shrimps. And of course the humus. It genuinely tasted Mediterranean and felt healthy. 5/5Value: Pricey enough to not be a go to Mediterranean place but fancy and appetizing enough to go every once in a while. Even for vegetarians. I think the food was really good and I wont think twice to go here if I'm craving Mediterranean. 4.5/5More: The wait for the restaurant, which is specially separate from the lounge/bar, is pretty long, about an hour, even on weekday nights. So we luckily got a table in the lounge which, I think, is no different than the restaurant table. Except that it is at the knee level.",0,0,0,Kunal R.,"Seattle, WA",133,16,0
3.0,5/16/2014,"While I typically shy away from cuisine classified as Mediterranean or Greek, a plethora of positive reviews for ilili and the occurrence of Restaurant Week finally persuaded me to make a reservation for dinner. Located in the Flatiron District of NYC, ilili is one of the few culinary destinations in an otherwise corporate-centric area. The restaurant boasts a large lounge area, where I've visited before to take advantage of their generous happy hour, a floor-level dining area, and an upstairs dining room as well. My friends and I were led upstairs to our table, and it was only afterwards that we agreed it was the louder, more crowded of the two.As for the food, ilili does a good job of offering a varied Restaurant Week menu, and includes many dishes that are served on a daily (non-RW) basis. We were all pretty unfamiliar with the items, but our server was helpful in clarifying and making suggestions. Despite some overlap, we were able to make our decisions without too much difficulty.We began with a split appetizer, a unique option that allows guests two different tastes for the first course. The Kibbe Naye Beirutieh was a distinctively Mediterranean take on steak tartare. A rectangular block of the tartare was garnished with onion slices, jalapeno peppers, mint and bulgar. It fell flat on flavor, lacking the requisite amount of salt and tartness to make the tartare stand out. A slightly better choice was the Arnabeet Mekle, pan-fried cauliflower that was topped with red finger chili, mint, and a labne tahini. Served with hummus, it was a satisfying spoonful to put on top of the pillowy pita bread that we were provided with.The entree is when things started to veer downhill. The Braised Beef Moujamadeh sounded delicious on paper; a delicious block of beef was accompanied by lentils, carrots, crispy onions, and complemented by an aromatic jus. While tender, the beef was similarly monotonous in flavor; we all voiced our wishes for something to cut through the richness of the sauce and the meat. I did, however, appreciate the textural contrast in the dish, as it was the first time I've had lentils paired with short rib.Dessert, a Labne Cheese Cake, almost appeared to have been created for my tastes. Supported by a brown butter crumble, the cheesecake was topped with a hibiscus and basil gelee, and paired with a blood orange-rose foam. While small in portion, each spoonful covered a full range of tastes and textures - tart, creamy, light, and subtly aromatic, it was everything that the initial dishes were not.Perhaps this dinner was suited simply to reaffirm the lack of affinity I have for Mediterranean cuisine; as a whole, the food lacked the necessary flavor to make the base ingredients shine. While I won't be returning any time soon, I can vouch for the attractive happy hour, which is perfect option for those who work in the area.",14,4,7,Lori L.,"New York, NY",2244,608,6827
1.0,5/15/2014,"I was in the mood for good Middle Eastern food, so after reading all the good reviews on Yelp, I suggested ililil for lunch to my friend.  We are both food lovers that have travelled the world and eaten great Middle Eastern food. We started with Baba Ghannouj and Hommus, both served with homemade pita.  The portions were small and both were just okay.  I am a huge Baba Ghannoush fan and I was not impressed, I have had better a Mamoun's Falafel for 1/2 the price. For the main course, we ordered Chicken Taouk Duo and Falafel Sandwich.  My dish, Chicken Taouk Duo was $23 and included a small herb salad, the smaller hindquarter of chicken, plus a chicken breast kebab, overpriced and overcooked. Thankfully, I ordered a side of potato fries to fill me up.  My friend was also not impressed with her falafel sandwich, just falafel (blah) and too many chucks of pickled veggies. For dessert, we had the Warm Date Cake, which I thought was under baked with an aftertaste of flour, my friend on the other hand enjoyed it.  The Chocolate Souffle with the Hazelnut drizzle was definitely the best part of the meal.  Not Middle Eastern, but damn good. Cappuccinos were small and just okay. The location, ambience, decor and service was really good but unfortunately, the food was below average, especially for the crazy prices they charge.  You can get a better meal from your local Middle Eastern restaurant or food truck.  OVERALL, Ililili SERVES MEDIOCRE MIDDLE EASTERN FOOD AT CRAZY PRICES.",6,0,0,Cristina B.,"Hoboken, NJ",0,39,0

Having already tried Italian, Japanese and Indian, I figured I'd try another type of cuisine. So Greek & Middle Eastern it was.  The ambiance and chic modern look are what you first notice when entering this restaurant. I started off the meal with a light and delicious gin cocktail, the fresh meadow.  I followed up with the labne. A light and fresh yogurt dip dish.  The bread that came along with the dish was good as well.As my main course I went with the duck shawarma.  The gamey duck along with the fig jam and green onion made for a complex and delicious pairing.ilili provided a fresh and delicious eating experience that I would highly recommend if you enjoy the flavors of Mediterranean and middle eastern cuisine.",1,0,0,Matt S.,"Bloomingdale, Washington, DC",61,164,49

4.0,5/3/2014,"My wife and I live nearby and this is our go-to spot. Ilili hits on all fronts - great food, great service and an upscale, yet comfortable, vibe. This is a place you can bring a bunch of friends, spent time with family or go out for a date. The only negative is the cavernous setting inside a corporate-feeling space, although the insertion of a lounge area and some soft touches in the dining room make it feel appropriately informal. Lebanese food is outstanding and there aren't many places that feature it. Rather than order entrees, we usually opt for multiple mezzes to share. My faves are the babaganoush, the duck shawarma, the kibbeh, the Brussel sprouts and the lahmajeen. If you happen to be 'rolling thick' (ie big group), they can do a sampler that gives you all the hits. If you can make it to dessert, get the warm date cake. You're welcome. I would remiss if I didn't mention the outstanding service here. The temptation must be great to turn tables quickly given growing popularity of this place and they NEVER rush you out. EVER.

By the time we got to plate 6, we had no idea how to find room for plates 7 and 8. But we persevered! The most memorable dish was the grilled octopus - it was prepared perfectly. I could have also eaten multiple helpings of the duck shawarma. The Tabbouleh salad and thyme salad were equally delightful. The only dish I could have skipped was the lamb sausage, it was just ok.

We sat at the bar and didn't interact much with the bartender except for ordering the drinks so not much to say but he did his job.We only ordered two apps - the lebne came in a tall shot glass with a few sticks of cucumber and carrot. it was OK, the yogurt was nice and thick but could have used more seasoning. The crudite were a bit too watery.The cheeserolls with kashkavel were good - like small fried cheesy spring rolls. They also have a private room upstairs overlooking the bar and lounge that looks like it would be great for a group gathering.I would definitely come back again for dinner to try more dishes.",1,0,0,Pauline L.,"Queens, NY",106,354,97

3.0,3/19/2014,This place was not my cup of tea- unhealthy with weird flavors. Brussel sprouts came much recommended- but I thought they were just OK. My friend thought the flavor was too overwhelming and I must agree- since I could not eat more than 2-3 without feeling full. I did not think yogurt and walnuts/grapes really go with them without it tasting like a dessert.Braised lamb sandwich was probably my favorite part of the meal. The falafel sandwich was not so great- chewy falafel (I like it more crispy) with radish which didn't really go. Fries were just OK (did not much care for the sauce on the side either).The service was great so I'm giving this 3 stars. Not worth 40 dollars for lunch.,1,0,1,Tamara H.,"Manhattan, NY",130,365,411
4.0,3/17/2014,"I really appreciated the service here. I wish I had gotten our waitresses's name because she was so sweet and attentive. It was one of my first times trying Lebanese style food. My partner had come here the night before and shared with the waitress that he liked it so much he decided to bring me here. She recommended we try the mezzas to get a broader flavor of Lebanese style food. FOOD:Mouhamara- One of my favorite dishes. It came on in little round balls that you can dip the pita in. The dip was a bit crunchy from the walnuts and spicy from the peppers but really deep flavor. We LOVED the warm soft pita bread that came with the meal. They were kind enough to keep on refilling as soon as it became low. It goes well with everything.Brussels Sprouts- This  is the most unique sauce I've had with brussels sprouts and it works! I felt the brussels sprouts were a bit over charged but still ok. The sauce on top is yogurt mint, walnuts, fig jam, and fresh grapes. Chankleesh- This is like my partner called it jokingly the caprese salad of Lebanon. It was feta, tomato, and onions. I'm not a huge fan of feta so it wasn't my favorite salad but glad I tried. It has a fresh taste to go with the meal. Bone Marrow- There were four large bones cut in half. I am going to describe it for those who might be wondering. It has a jelly like consistency and really rich in flavor fatty almost creamy. It taste great smeared like a spread on crusty bread. This one came with pita and a tabbouleh. It was fun to insert the marrow into the pita pocket and put some tabbouleh.Mekanek- Lamb with pine nuts in a lemon sauce. They look like breakfast sausages. I felt as though the sauce was too vinegary for me. SERVICE:The service was great! She shared up front she could only fit a few dishes at a time but she will have them out as soon as we are able to fit more. She came by several times to see how were were doing. She asked if we were enjoying the food. She asked if we had any questions to help me better understand the food. She gave us a free dessert at the end because she wanted to show appreciation to repeat customers and food lovers.",1,0,1,Stephanie T.,"Manhattan, NY",3,36,3

We were one of the first people there, but the place filled up fairly quickly afterward. So I recommend that you make a reservation before you come.We both got their $25 lunch pre-fixe, which comes with one entree and one side. I got their lamb burger and phoenician fries. The burger was good, but nothing out of this world. I really liked the way they seasoned the fries, but they were kind of soggy and soft. Since I like my fries crispy, I ended up not enjoying my fries too much in the end. I also got their grapefruit+rose water drink, which was really great.Overall, I wasn't terribly impressed with their food. It wasn't bad in any way, but there was nothing special about it. The service felt a bit rushed too. But their redeeming qualities are huge portions and amazing venue. I ended up having 3/4 of my burger and half of my fries, and I was already completely full.

When it came to drinks, our server gave us a range of gin options and suggested one in particular, without mentioning that it would cost extra.

It's a huge place with a little bar seating area up near the front. There decor is awesome and simple. I like the ambiance very much. The seats near the back room and mirrors can get a little too dark for me. We started with a kale salad. Not bad. Everything was fresh but could use a little more seasoning. Moussaka wasnt bad either. Very tasty, nice and refreshing. It was like a gazpacho but in solid form.Arnabeet Mekle was also alright. The cauliflower was fried perfectly.Kebab Kerez: Lamb and beef meatballs with cherry sauce, kataifi, scallions was very good! My girlfriend and I liked this one a lot. The sauce was beautiful. Like rainbows in your mouth.For the main course, I went with the braised beef moujamadeh. The beef was nice, tender, and juicy. I'm a huge fan of lentils with pork belly and beef so this was great. In my head, it would be nice to get a nice sweeter jus to accompany this. Diver scallops were cooked very well. Chutney was super enjoyable. Dessert we got the ashta and the cheese cake. The ashta was.. interesting. I liked it but I think you have to get used to it. It's a weird flavor/texture. Cheese cake was done very well. The brown butter crumble.

4.0,3/7/2014,"Came for restaurant week. Water refills on point the whole course. Attentive staff and management. Now the food.. I enjoyed the hummus but honestly can't get the hummus from Zahav in Philly off my palette, hard to beat. La La loved the moussaka (eggplant puree) and braised beef. The steak tartar also tasted very good but purely because of the texture I would probably not order again (I know..) The ilili candy bar was magnificent and I loved the way the pistachio was a part of it. I had an alcoholic drink with blueberry in its name. With blueberry stoli vodka. It was extremely strong but personally did not enjoy it. Also though I understand it was restaurant week and there are many reservations, the staff and mamagement made it too obvious how they were rushing to have us out for the next table from beginning to end.

5.0,3/7/2014,"Just as Restaurant Week came to a close, I accepted the gracious offer from ilili's management to come back for a do-over of my previous experience. I am amazed at how ""night and day"" the whole evening was for myself and my guest. We were seated in the main dining room in a nice corner table near the center where we could take in the entire space. I seriously didn't realize how much it resembles a labyrinth, albeit a gilded and romantic one. Our server was attentive without being obtrusive and seemed to be genuinely excited about every ounce of food we ordered. The establishment had also arranged for a complimentary appetizer to be offered to us, which was a pleasant and completely unnecessary surprise. The little treats were like a Lebanese style panchetta (made of veal) in a mini pancake sandwich...so delicious. Once we had stuffed ourselves silly with all the Lebanese goodness the Pre-Fixe had to offer, the check came with an immense thank you and no rush at all to leave. While I finished my desert, one of the managers, Sheena, came over to thank me for returning and to ensure that I had a much more satisfying experience this time. I really have to say how amazing they handled this whole service issue. They really care about the individual links and go above and beyond to make sure that each guest's experience is as good as it can get.

2.0,3/6/2014,"I've never left a restaurant with a worse taste in my mouth. And the food was actually quite good! Unfortunately the service was terrible, and as a former waitress I'm really not one to complain about service. Was at least 20 minutes before our waitress took our order, and our empty plates sat in front of us for a half an hour after we were finished. To give you an idea, they sat us on time for our 7:00 reservation and we didn't walk out until 10:20!Also, this is probably the only place I've ever been where making a reservation works against you.  Had read about the happy hour beforehand and looked at the menus. Was excited to try the ""From Beirut with Passion"" (delicious!) and get it for $7 instead of $14. However apparently this only applies in the bar/lounge (which is the great majority of the restaurant). If you have a reservation they tend to seat you upstairs in the dining room, which is much smaller and in my opinion has a far less desirable ambiance. I didn't know this stipulation until getting the bill and seeing full price drinks. The manager (a tall woman, not sure of her name) explained it all with quite an attitude and said they tell people this ""all the time."" Well if it happens all the time, maybe the issue is on the part of the restaurant! I realize the happy hour sometimes doesn't apply in the dining room, but this is always very clearly indicated on the menu...and I'm fine with that! They just really need to be more clear about it all if they are going to seat patrons in the dining room without request, when we could have been sat in the more fun bar/lounge (which had open tables by the way). It was all just very annoying on principle, when we were not informed and had no choice in the matter. The manager did end up taking two of the six drinks off, but it was too little too late. It's too bad because the restaurant week menu was better than most in terms of selection and on par with many good places in terms of quality. I walked in thinking I might want to come back and take my boyfriend, and walked out thinking...not a chance!!!

Yup, I love it that much. As someone who studies in DC, i've been on a quest to find brussel sprouts that are on par with Ilili's, but let's just say, sparks aren't flying.  The duck shawarma is another favorite of mine along with the muhammara. For dessert, the Ilili candy bar is definitely the perfect finish to a delectable night. Ilili is a must when you're in NY because it makes you fall in love with Mediterranean cuisine all over again.

I have only ever come for happy hour but I must come back for dinner based on how amazing the happy hour food is!First things first...I have never had a problem being seated for happy hour because there is ample seating and people usually share tables/couches with other groups. I love the layout of the bar area! It is so comfortable and relaxing and the low lighting truly allows you to unwind after work. I get there between 5:30-6 pm and seating is no issue; however, it slowly starts to become crowded.The food is just great! I usually always order the beef shawarma and the mini falafels! My go to happy hour drink is the black, blue & bubbles. I don't drink often so one of those drinks definitely relaxes my central nervous system. :)It is easily accessible via the 6 train and is an easy walk to Penn Station (which is where I catch the train home). The staff is always pleasant and attentive.I LOVE the restroom! It is so modern and upscale. It feels very comfortable. There is an attendant there to offer you whatever you need to refreshed after using the restroom (e.g., perfume of cologne).

3.0,3/5/2014,"3.5 stars -- The three of us finally decided to reserve just in time to take advantage of Restaurant Week. The experience at ilili was generally fine for the first run, though, not as great as anticipated. It's a considerably upscale Mediterranean restaurant, boasting a number of familiar and new, different dishes. A very nice departure and big step up from the common Mediterranean joint, and for those who enjoy Mediterranean food, ilili is certainly worth the try. The first floor is broken up into areas that largely evoke a lounge feel, with dim lighting cast throughout and chillout music playing from the bar. Super high ceilings and tall wooden pillars give the illusion of a much bigger space. As you enter, you'll approach the lounge and bar area, a very sleek and upscale interior of soft leather couches and small candle lit tables. While waiting for our third guest to arrive, we took a quick moment to try their happy hour specialty cocktails ($7) at the bar. The Fresh Meadow is a very smooth, lovely tarty concoction of gin, St. Germain, mint, cucumber, and ginger. Aside from dining, I would actually return just for their happy hour, considering the ambiance and pricing on quality drinks.We were brought over to the second floor, an offset, smaller, quieter space from the main dining and lounge areas. It doesn't carry the same appeal of the first floor, which makes it feel slightly incongruent, but the quieter atmosphere serves better for intimate meetups. Service was generally good, although I'll note that the timing of the food was a little off. It took a long time for our appetizers to arrive, and our entrees arrived midway into still wrapping up the starters. For appetizers, we each managed to try the Moussaka, a puree of eggplant, tomato, garlic, onion and olive oil, the Kibbe Naye Beirutieh, a steak tartar with burghul with a side of chopped onion and mint, and the Chicken Livers seasoned with pomegranate molasses, lemon, and sumac. For main, we all ordered the Braised Beef Moujamadeh, braised beef that rests atop a bed of lentils, carrots, onions and aromatic jus sauce. As a side, we added in the popular Phoenician Fries seasoned in sumac and parsley, paired with a garlic whip. Lastly, for dessert, we had the Labne Cheese Cake and ilili Candy Bar. All appetizers alone were wonderful and generous in portion size. They arrive with a basket of fresh warm, soft pita pocket bread. The steak tartare was delicious. It had a slightly more dense body than expected. Drizzle on some olive oil, this is a delectable appetizer worth ordering. The Moussaka and Chicken Livers made for equally great dishes. The Chicken Livers are paired well with a Labne yogurt cheese topped with olives. Even for those who aren't so keen on liver, it is worth the try because the yogurt cheese offsets that expected strong taste. The side of Phoenician Fries was a bit underwhelming. While it appeared to have been seasoned very well, it was actually very bland to taste. Onto the entree, the braised beef was a huge disappointment. For the most part, I found it to lack a lot of flavor. The beef was properly cooked, tender and soft, though it tasted very bland for the most part. The au jus was more a thicker sauce that didn't carry or add much. The overdone amounts of parsley on top acted more as garnish for visual appeal, and the lentils were also quite bland. Overall, not the most savory braised beef dish with ingredients that didn't completely enhance. With each bite, in my mind was I begging for Sriracha sauce or perhaps just some salt. I found the dessert to be very enjoyable, yet also confusing. It reminded us of key lime pie versus cheesecake. With ingredients like brown butter crumble, hibiscus gelee, basil gelee, and blood orange-rose foam, we were expecting something very different. From texture to taste, it wasn't quite reminiscent of cheesecake, but it was still a sweet, yet tarty treat that we managed to enjoy.ilili wasn't a terrible experience, though I was anticipating something more than what was offered for Restaurant Week. Dinner went from good to generally disappointing. A second, regular dinner visit will be required. Perhaps if not feeling obligated to order options off a pre-fixe dinner menu, the experience would be different.",7,2,3,Sara L.,"Manhattan, NY",721,552,3545

Amongst them, the grilled octopus (with lamb belly and grapefruit) is something I could eat every day. Absolutely perfectly executed.

We decided on the restaurant week menu, though it did not offer some of ilili's more well known items (duck schwarma, Brussels sprouts, grilled octopus), because it offered 2 appetizers each, an entree and a dessert. Our server happily made suggestions. Of note on the starters were: The kale salad, the feta and tomato salad, the jalapeño or cauliflower hummus, and the eggplant. I liked the stake tartare but it wasn't a table favorite. The falafel appetizer was good but very large and too filling. We also got unlimited pita bread. We were almost full by the time the entrees came. 3 of us ordered the sea bass, which was light and buttery and a great choice after gorging on appetizers. The risotto was good but more well suited to eat with a steak than on its own. Dessert: get the knefeh!! You won't regret it. It is very rich though. The 6 of us could only finish half.

There was a coat check and a bar where we could wait for our table to be ready. I think we sat down about five minutes after the reservation time, which was nice. It took us a bit of time to order. The restaurant was really busy, so it's understandable. However, while we waited for our order to be taken and throughout the meal, our waters were constantly replenished. Once we put our orders in, everything came out really quickly, one course after the other. I was so happy with the food. I got the steak tartare and cauliflower for the appetizer and the beef for the main course. Oh man, they were amazing. I could eat that steak and beef again and again. They were perfect. I got the cheesecake for dessert. It was good, but I would try something else next time. My friend got the pine nut hummus, the falafel, the risotto and clotted cheese. I kept eating her hummus - it was so good! The falafel was nice - not too heavy. Also, the clotted cheese was interesting - I loved the pistachio and rise flavors. She was happy with her meal.

3.0,2/28/2014,"I went there for Restaurant Week lunch. The place is spacious and the decor is nice. My friend and I ordered hummus, fries, lamb shank, lamb dip. ashta, and candy bar. I personally did not like the hummus. For me, it was too tangy and lacking salt. Fries on the other hand was well spiced and delicious. Both my friend's and my lamb was under seasoned. I can taste that the meat was fresh and well cooked, but it was totally bland, so was my au jus. My friend and I shared our food. Her eggplant was well seasoned, but overall it was a bland dish was well. I liked the fruit on my Ashta dessert, as well as the rose syrup, but it was too much heavy cream that I could not eat just like that. If the syrup is less sweet and switch the heavy cream ball to vanilla ice cream, it would be a lot better. My friend is more of a dessert person than me, but she thinks her candy bar was too sweet as well. Their service was neither good or bad. It was slow at first. We told our waiter that we were ready to order, but still waited for a long time before another waiter comes to take our order. They expedite the service after we told them that we were kinda in a hurry. They also almost served us the wrong dish and did not realize it immediately. Waiters looked confused. I think they were not very organized.",0,0,0,Stella Z.,"Campbell, CA",34,220,53

4.0,2/26/2014,"Knowing nothing about this place before walking in the door, other than it was highly recommended by a Lebanese friend of a friend, I was happy with my experience here.  We happened upon NYC restaurant week, and while I'm not typically a fan of RW, it turned out to be a good deal for the money - $38 for 2 appetizers, an entree, and dessert.The best part of the meal was definitely the appetizers: hummus, falafel (they look like brownies), chanakleesh (feta cheese with tomatoes), and moussaka. After reading the reviews, I'm a little upset I missed out on the magical brussels sprouts.  I think the chanakleesh was my favorite.  It was a little funny how the server used his spoon to mash it onto the plate to ""make it more edible"" as if we wouldn't have been able to eat it otherwise.The warm whiskey drink was ok.  A bit too sweet and luke warm.  The Monsanto wine was delicious.  My entree, the only vegetarian option - a risotto with butternut sqaush was not very good.  Not creamy enough, not enough cheese, the rice under cooked and definitely lacking in spice and flavor.  This was disappointing after all of the fantastic appetizers.  The dessert was too much.  We ended up ordering the Knafe Bil - an upsidedown cheese tart.  We thought that 2 of us had to order it, in order to get it, since it stated it was a 2-person portion.  We ended up being served two giant cheese tarts, which was enough for about 10 people.  It seems like a waste to serve so much.  I even took it home and ate some a few times after that.  It's really similar to baked brie.The atmosphere is large and spacious, especially by NYC standards.  My friend described it as ""dated"" but I was happy they played Portishead during dinner.",0,0,0,Natalee F.,"Philadelphia, PA",111,252,50

3.0,2/19/2014,"I went here for dinner with a group of friends recently. The atmosphere was amazing, very high ceilings and dim lights-perfect for an outing with a friends or a date. Our server was very knowledgeable and energetic. We started off with 4 apps as the portions are fairly small here. We had the cauliflower, moussaka, phoenician fries, and jalapeno hummus. The phonenician fries were magnificent, perfectly seasoned and they come with a garlic sauce, which went perfectly with the seasoning. Sadly, I was not impressed with any of the other apps. I am a huge eggplant fan; however, I found the moussaka to be very bland and did not like the fact that it was cold.  For the main course, my friend and I shared the rissoto, which I thought was pretty good.The butternut squash worked very well in this dish. For desert, we ordered the ilili candy bar  and the special desert for the night which was a devils food cake with some sort of lavendar mousse. Both desserts were excellent, very unique and light. The ilili candy bar a nice crunch to it. If you like chocolate-def. recommend getting it.

3.0,2/19/2014,"2014 Winter Restaurant Week: 3.5I really wanted to love this place. The fact that I settled on a 3.5 rating actually made me question my taste and doubt myself for a bit because everyone is hailing 5 stars or 4. This place unfortunately fell quite short of my 4 star rating. I would be lying if I say ""Yay! I'm a fan.""  I don't want to use the word overhyped but none of the food we had really stood out and none of them was really out-of-this-world fantastic. The service however was truly phenomenal from start to finish. What I loved about our server the most was his honesty and attentiveness. When he noticed my friend received the wrong drink, he immediately proposed to have it changed. We didn't even notice the difference and he could've easily just ignored it and pretended he didn't notice. But no, he was proactive in providing us what we ordered even if we didn't complain about it. I just didn't like that the tables were so close together and we could hear our neighboring customers' conversations from both left and right.  I also didn't like the fact that we were seated in the back area with a not-so-fancy interior and not in the main dining room. We came for RW. We didn't have the famous brussel sprouts, the fries, or the lamb that everyone has been raving about. Maybe that's why my overall rating is only a sad 3.5?? It is worth noting though that the appetizers alone were very filling. And I really love the fact that one person gets 2 appetizers for RW. Appetizers: Hummus with pine nuts - good but not memorableMoussaka - good but nothing to rave about  Falafel - super hard, definitely not what I expectedKibbe Naye Beirutieh - it was like spam smothered with olive oil and jalapeno but it was good nonethelessMain Entrees:Risotto - very good and tasty; it was quite salty for my friend's taste but I loved itChicken Shish Taouk - okay at bestDesserts:Ilili candy bar - I was hesitating on getting this because I thought it was going to have a super hard texture but it was soft enough to be cut with a spoon.

I wish they came earlier because I was already very full. Soft warm pancakes with thick bacons inside!6. Duck Sharwarma - Duck wraps. Nothing very special but I loved it! It's diced duck with salad inside the wrap. 7. Baba ghannouj- eggplant dip that I paired with the bread8. Brussel Sprouts- I didn't like this dish probably because I don't really eat brussel sprouts. ( I don't hate it) It tasted bitter and the grapes in the dish were very sweet ( not fresh grape sweet, more like syrup sweet)Price : Around $50 per person Suggestion : If you are just 2 or 3 people, order 5 or 6 dishes.

Not a cocktail type of person and had 2! Must try the refreshing Fresh Meadow and tasty seasonal option Cedar Cider (served cold or hot; opted for cold). MEZZAS:Brussel sprouts!...uniquely prepared and assembled. A perfect marriage of sweet and savory; is very light but you feel guilty cuz it tastes decadent. Just try it and you won't be disappointed.Shrimp hommus (that's how they spell it): so very creamy; must get with shrimpOctopus: perfectly tender (very difficult to do with THICK cuts) with yum lamb pastrami and a citrus vinaigrette dressed greens to cut the richness of the pastrami. Grape leaves: subtle tomato based bite sized snacks similar in size to vienna sausages (vs. the overly lemony versions at many other places)ENTREE:Mixed grill (for 2): 2 perfectly black and blue kafta lamb chops (as requested) served over herb roasted tomatoes, chicken shish taouk (juicy and tender), lamb kebab, and the unassuming yet very tasty ratatouille.  Served with garlic whip trio each specifically made for each of the meats.DESSERT: Get the huckleberry cheesecake and candy bar.  Cheesecake went oh so well with a glass (ahem...2 glasses) of their spanish MoscatelWINE:A bottle of Grgich Hills Zinfandel...yumLast but not least:SERVICE: Great, very knowledgeable and attentive staff....and they gave us some complimentary lip smackingly good passion fruit cocktail and a strained yogurt dish. :)",2,0,0,David P.,"Manhattan, NY",73,442,371

2.0,1/24/2014,"Came here for a friend's birthday - food was ok. The Brussels sprout and fig jam was a little too sweet, duck schwarma was good but a little on the dry side. Rice and hummus was nothing special. But what brought this review down to a two was the service - the judging tone when some of us ordered three appetizers for our meal instead of an entree or those of us who ordered an entree, she asked about an appetizer. We are here to eat and enjoy the food, not gorge myself because I did that during thanksgiving dinner back home. we were here for a birthday and after stuffing ourselves, not everyone wanted dessert but we had to get something for the birthday girl - so we ordered two desserts for some of us to share - but she told us with attitude that it would not be enough for the ten of us to share - yes we are aware. Only five of us were going to participate. If I wanted to be judged for my eating and sharing habits, I would've gone home to my mother",1,0,0,Fiona C.,"New York, NY",35,425,22

3.0,1/21/2014,"Came here with two other girls for a late Saturday dinner. The venue is interesting. High ceilings with wooden rectangular panels. Very dim lighting and quite loud music but there were many large groups and fairly busy at 10pm. We got: -Complimentary labne (Turkish yogurt dip) with olive oil, herbs, and olives, with baked herb pita chips - quite good. Would've ordered more of this but in hindsight was basically like plain greek yogurt to me.-Brussels sprouts: Fig jam, grapes, mint yogurt, walnuts - very good and everyone has raved about it but very heavy. The grapes were a bit gratuitous. I enjoyed the creaminess of the yogurt to compliment the charred brussel sprouts, and the walnuts were good. However this dish was a bit too sweet. Couldn't taste the mint in the yogurts-Mekanek: sautéed lamb sausage with pine nuts and lemon - flavorful and VERY lemony. Also had a bite of spice, something akin to cinnamon or nutmeg. A little gritty and dry, though; I thought the lamb would be more tender-Warm eggplant - tomato, scallions, tamarind molasses: I don't know if there was tomato in this. Very good, kind of like a dry sautéed eggplant, very sweet and savory. I am not an eggplant fan but this won me over.-Bone marrow: sour cherry tabbouleh, pita pillows: underwhelming. I liked the tabbouleh because it was fresh and bright, but the pita pillows were dry and perhaps could have been replaced by more tabbouleh. Bone marrow was rich and the bones were large but they weren't seasoned well.We were offered a lot of warm pita bread which was appreciated; they were very puffy but pretty tasteless and not as fluffy as they looked. They were dry and we didn't end up eating much of it. Perhaps we should've asked for more baked pita instead.There are a few dishes I'd try if I came back (thyme salad, lamb and beef meatballs, hindbeh) but I would have to keep in mind the interesting, but heavy, flavors and pairings and the dry bread. The entrees seem quite expensive and the appetizers all seem interesting enough so I would probably avoid those again if I came back.",0,0,0,Ju Hyun L.,"New York, NY",2,13,0

However, what I did have was generally just pretty good - 3.5.We started with the Hummus. My wife liked it but I did not - I thought the lemon and Tahini were overpowering. The pita that was served with it was actually my favorite part - fresh, light, airy. We then had the Moussaka, Brussel Sprouts and Mekanek (sauteed lamb sausage). The lamb sausage was delicious but the presentation was rather unappealing - imagine those mini oscar-meyer sausages that you mixed with mac n cheese as a kid.

4.0,1/4/2014,"My boyfriend and I decided to come here on a whim because it was close by and I've never been to a Lebanese restaurant before. We were seated right away but we both felt awkward since everyone was wearing business casual or formal clothes while we entered in jeans. I'm not sure whether it was because we felt out of place or if it was because of the interior design, but the place just didn't feel cozy or inviting. The place had dim lighting that was white instead of yellow, which may have been why the atmosphere felt more cold.Although the ambience wasn't the best, the restaurant still deserves 4 stars for its great food. Their hummus is wonderfully creamy with a little olive oil drizzled on top and the pita bread arrives at the table like little puffed balloons. I thought the pita was a little more on the dry side, but that problem was solved with the hummus and olive oil. I had the braised lamb shank sandwich with fried eggplant, labne, and mixed nuts on the side. I was surprised to see nuts by the sandwich but I love mixed nuts so I'm not even going to complain! The lamb was so tender and flavorful while the labne added a different texture and tartness to the sandwich. The sandwich tends to fall apart and the juices end up in the bun or on your fingers but that's when you lick your fingers and resort to using a fork and knife. I got to try my boyfriend's lamb burger and holy moly it  was so juicy and perfectly medium done that we ended up switching our dishes and eating each other's halves. At the end, I still made him leave me a little of my own sandwich because I obviously couldn't just neglect it!The food here is great but I really wish I had enjoyed the atmosphere just as much.

4.0,1/1/2014,"Ilili is a contemporary Lebanese restaurant near the Flatiron district that captures your imagination when you walk in off of 5th Avenue. Long and narrow, the warm colors, beautiful wood and high ceilings give a light and airy feel.  Upon entering the space you see a comfortable lounge and a bar.  A large wall of wood and glass separates these social spaces from the main dining room and provides a cozy feel.We opted to forgo ordering a main dish and instead ordered several small plates so we could sample as much as possible. Our waiter, Danny, was knowledgeable and very helpful making excellent suggestions on what to try.  All our dishes ranged from $9.00 to $19.00.Two of our more filling plates were Kibbe Naya $15 (raw lamb kibbe, served with chopped red onions, radish and mint) and Grilled Octopus $19.  Both were very good, but surprisingly I enjoyed the Kibbe Naya more than the octopus which seemed mundane by comparison.  I gobbled up the Kibbe Naya with the small warm pita bread served and a garlic spread that was fragrant and creamy.If you love veggies two options we ordered that were absolutely delicious included Fattoush $12 which is a salad with fried crisps of pita bread, mixed greens, mint and pine nuts. Also worth noting (and possibly my favorite dish) was the Dandelion salad $9, which is similar to steamed spinach.If my review has tempted you, I should let you know that this place is very popular.

5.0,12/29/2013,"Delicious Mediterranean / Lebanese / Greek place in Flatiron.  The ambiance is second to none and the food is spectacular.  First off, the venue is massive.  The bar and lounge area is a great place to hang out as you wait for you entire party to arrive.  There is a lot of wood and dim lighting, which softens the straight, modern décor of the restaurant.  The cocktail list was long and varied - everything looked delicious whether you like sweet and fruity or something with a kick or old fashioned and sophisticated.  I went with their version of a bloody mary, which was quite interesting.  It wasn't tomato juice thick; quite the opposite, it was non-viscous but had a great tomato flavor.  You could taste the freshness of the tomato as well as the accompanying spices.We went shared amongst 3 girls, so we ordered 4 tapas and 1 main.  The food came out quickly and was well-paced.  The duck shawarma was utterly delectable.  Duck magret and chicken are mixed with fig jam, green onion, and garlic whip and wrapped in a cone-shaped pita.  Wow, I'm salivating just thinking about it!  The poultry was juicy and tender and the fig jam added the right hint to sweetness to a savory dish.  I usually dislike the sweet-salty combo, but ilili did it perfectly.  The portion size was rather large with 4 pieces.  The atayef and veal bacon stuffed between two buns with fig jam, pickles, and peppers was equally yummy.  I'm usually scared of bacon and soft, jiggly, fat meat, but the protein in this sandwich was neither too lean nor too fatty.  The bun was soft and the flavor so sinfully rich.  What an amazing dish.  Per other yelper's recommendations, we also got the Phoenician fries, which were pretty good, especially when dipped in garlic whip.  The fries were of the fatter, softer looking variety.  They were crispy when they came out fresh but got a little soggy over time.  The sumac and parsley added a burst of flavor to the fries, but I generally prefer crispy, skinny Cajun fries - more flavor per fry.  The beef fried kibbeh was good.  The beef wasn't spicy but very fried, looking almost like falafel.  It was a little on the drier side.  The lamb chops were the entrée dish.  It came out on the bone and was quite succulent.  It didn't have a gamey taste and instead reflected the salsa verde it was seared with.    The service was excellent, the ambiance chic, and the food amazing (especially the duck shawarma and atayef and veal bacon).  Ilili is a winner that I will be returning to soon.",1,0,0,Michelle L.,"Manhattan, NY",65,84,0

4.0,12/17/2013,"I thought Ilili was very good. In particular, I was impressed with the fresh, rich, smokey flavor of the baba ganoush and hummus which put it this food just a notch above your typical lower priced middle eastern restaurant. In addition, the whole fish cooked in mustard sauce was excellent. Chicken kabobs tasted very slightly underdone, but they were seasoned well and we didn't get food poisoning, so, I can't really complain. The little square falafel were a nice touch and our dessert of light airy filo in a bird's nest pattern encircling rich creamy mousse + rose water was unique and well worth the extra calories.Ilili has a stylish soothing ambience and seems like it would be a good place to go on a date.It's worth mentioning that this meal was completely comped for me and as a result I cannot fully comment on the value. That being said, in my experience this type of cuisine is easy to come by - good quality for reasonable prices throughout the city. I got the impression that our bill was somewhat high (food, not liquor) and I generally don't like to splurge on cuisines that are easily accessible. It's akin to P.F. Chang's - the food is alright, but why bother when you can get excellent (and more authentic) Chinese food in China town for next to nothing.In sum, I'd happily go back to Ilili but wouldn't splurge and would focus on the more exotic dishes that are unique to Ilili.",3,0,1,Eve L.,"Oklahoma City, OK",337,328,99

I have Celiac Disease, so I am on a 100% gluten free diet for medical reasons  and I am extremely sensitive to trace amounts. I never expect to be able to eat things at holiday parties, but I called the restaurant ahead of time to ask if they were Celiac-friendly. To my surprise, they said, ""Yes very! If you give us the name of your reservation we will let the chef and wait staff know that you will be there."" Amazing! I've never come across this before. They also said that everything for the party has already been ordered but that there will be things I can eat. At the restaurant, I was introduced to a woman who seemed to be running the party. She showed me the appetizers that were gluten free that were already laid out and pointed me out to the wait staff. The waiters began walking around with trays of more appetizers, and to my surprise the woman came up to me with a small plate of three appetizers and said that the chef had prepared it for me gluten free! I got another plate later that night. And the chocolate truffles were naturally gluten free - and delicious! All of the food was incredible.One of my friends has a nut allergy, and the truffles had nuts in it. When he saw this, he turned to his girlfriend and politely reminded her that she couldn't kiss him if she ate it.

3.0,12/9/2013,"Decent. 3.5 rounded down if I must pick 3 or 4. We ordered 4 appetizers (and no entrees). The problem with this place is that the dishes are either complete hits or complete misses. We had the brussel sprouts, octopus salad, lamb sausages, and beef schwarma (sp?).Now folks, the brussel sprouts are good only because you've never really had good vegetables, or vegetables cooked properly. It tastes great simply because it's been roasted and burnt to the point where it just tastes like bbq. It's not because there's a special recipe or anything. The octopus salad, on the other hand, was uniquely refreshing and one of the best octopus salads I've ever had in the city. They paired it with pork belly? or some magical mystery meat and it just absolutely melted in your mouth.Unfortunately the last 2 dishes were completely forgettable. The sausages tasted sour for some reason and the beef schwarma tasted worse than a cart version.

1.0,12/7/2013,"Went for lunch last week - on the whole, very disappointing. Had wanted to try this place for quite a while given the very positive yelp reviews, and while I agree that their brussel sprouts are tasty in moderation (since they're served in a very sweet sauce) and the service is great (our waiter was really very nice) - everything else we ate while there was just gross. The food (ex the brussel sprouts) was bland and/or burned to a crisp - this includes the lamb chunks served on tasteless hummus (with hard pita bread), the lamb pizza (just gross), and the falafel which was inedible!!! When the falafel came to the table, my boyfriend and I actually thought they had mistakenly served us chocolate cake - that is how dark it was; really very burned - we each took one bite and left the rest on the plate. Everything was greasy. Left feeling just disgusting - oily and gross. Not good. Lots of other mediterranean places in the city to enjoy.",5,0,0,Sonya B.,"New York, NY",5,50,0

I haven't tried a lot mid-eastern/greed food before so I can't really comment on the authenticity. But the dishes were very tasty! We all had the brunch prefix (main course + side + drink), which was a good deal. I had the Fresh Fruit Atayef (lebanese pancake) with Hommus as the side. It tasted like a crepe and quite good, but I couldn't finish it because I ate too much pita with the Hommus and Baba Ghannouj. I love the Baba Ghannouj!! My friends had Lamb Dip, Chakchouka Eggs in Cocotte, and Truffle Eggs Benedict. They all enjoyed their dishes very much. The Lamb Dip smelled great. I tried a piece of eggplant in it and it was amazing!

Highlights were the brussel sprouts perfectly complemented with sweet fig jam and grapes, amazing soft pita bread and duck shwarma, which had unexpected pomegranate arils sprinkled inside. Was not a fan of the gnocchi entree we split, which had a jarring sourness from the yogurt-based(I think?) sauce.Service was friendly, but I felt the time between the two rounds of food we got was unreasonably long- we sat around for a while after our first dishes had been cleared.

4.0,10/28/2013,"How do you pronounce this place? I feel like Xena the warrior princess when I try to do so. We ordered a few mezza dishes to share, and although they're supposedly ""appetizers,"" the portions were substantial enough that we were bursting full at the end of the meal.My favorite was the Grilled Spanish Coast Octopus, served with lamb belly ""pastrami"" and a citrus & fennel salad. The octopus itself was very well-seasoned and on the firm side (alert for those who prefer soft octopi instead). The lamb belly, however, was OUT OF THIS WORLD - I love lamb and never had anything quite like it. The best way to describe it was a game-y pork belly, as it was smoky, wild, and melts in my mouth. Absolutely memorable and tasty, and the citrus fennel salad was a nice acidic touch that cuts through the fatty lamb belly when it begins to get overwhelming.I also really really liked the grilled tuna belly (do you see a trend going on here?). I'm normally not a fan of tuna (that for another time), but I've never had tuna so succulent and tender as this one. The deliciously salty and seasoned sear on the skin added immense flavor to the otherwise bland fish, and the middle was a blushing pink. I wished there was more than 3 pieces.Then, believe everyone else on yelp and order the Phoenician fries, because that garlic whip is absolutely worth it. I had major garlic breath the rest of the meal and was unapologetic (sorry, dining companion).The labne was unremarkable for me as it just tastes like thick greek yogurt, and although the roe ($10 extra) gave it an interesting salty twist, it also summed up as the most expensive plate of Greek yogurt ever. The Brussels sprouts are hearty and tastes just as expected.The ambiance is an interesting mix, as you see people dressed ranging from jeans and t-shirt to suits.

This happy memory came back to me while I was frantically trying to plan a team dinner last week. I had to plan a dinner for my team of six who were all visiting NY for two days.

We ordered the Out of the box, box shaped falafels which is my absolute favorite appetizer here. Hummus, Brussel sprouts, Beef shawarma were all fantastic. The tabouleh was a little too tangy for my liking. For my entree, I ordered the lamb chops and oh my god were they good!!! I forgot that I had my manger sitting beside me and licked my fingers clean. My colleagues did appreciate all their entrees so it seems like you are a hapy camper, no matter what you order:)  For desert, we got the Lemon meringue which was yummy and the Knafe.

1.0,9/24/2013,"This is going to be an interesting review, so hold on tightly.I scoped this place out as somewhere I thought my mother and I would have a nice night out when we were visiting NYC this past August. They seemed to be gluten-free friendly, and based on other Yelpers, I figured this was a good middle of the road / just fancy enough without being grossly expensive kind of place, with good food and atmosphere.We made a reservation, and it was walking distance from our hotel. We were seated immediately upon arriving, but were taken upstairs into an interesting upper room where it was small, the tables and booths were very close to eachother, and head room was minimal. We were seated at a single booth / table combo, but the other tables were definitely less than 24"" away on either side, so I new as the night went on it was going to be interesting, ie, we were going to get squished and be able to hear other conversations clearly.The water/bus boy asked us if we wanted anything to drink, to which I replyed ""water,"" to which he replied ""what kind?"" This kind of stumped me, but it's New York, so I guess people spend lots of different money other forms of water since tap water isn't good enough for them, when tap water is actually better for you than bottled water. I was obviously flustered and just said, ""what other kind of water is there?"" to which he replied, ""some people ask for sparkling,"" and I said ""no."" Seriously, if I had wanted sparkling water I would have said ""sparkling water,"" but I guess you can knock the guy for double checking. But HAH, it gets better.Our waitress came to the table and helped us decide what to order, since I am gluten-free and soy-free I like to ask questions. She knew exactly what was gluten-free or easily edited gluten-free. I believe I also asked them about what kind of oil they use, (checking for soy), and I believe she said everything was olive oil, but I can't remember now. Apparently at a place like this it's best to order an entree with a couple mezze's, which are smaller portions, and together they help to round out the meal. We decided on getting one entree to split, and three other mezzes. All this time I was thinking, hmm, that seems like a too much food for two women who aren't ""stuffers"" at a restaurant and don't eat a ton. But we took her suggestion and got a salad, the brussel sprouts, some hummus (which I had to have), and the lamb entree appetizer.The hummus came first, and they were able to sub fresh cut veggies for the typical pita-bread line up. Score. There was a good assortment of vegetables, but I wish there were more for the amount of hummus there was.The salad, brussel sprouts and lamb then came. The salad was delicious (and of course overpriced) but I found a huge piece of celophane (obviously from what the lettuce came in) in my salad. I alerted the waiter, and they were extremely apologetic, offering to bring us a new salad. We replied ""No, it was just a piece of plastic, and we've already eaten the salad and it was delicious"" - that's customer code word for: ""come on people, watch more closely, don't serve your customers a salad with plastic in it, that's sloppy, just refund us instead."" After a million ""are you sure you don't want another salad?"" they left us alone. AND then the manager came and spoke to us, apologizing for the restaurant. This was fine, and what should have happened from the beginning. He offered us a new salad, which we admantly declined, we had so much food, and obviously don't want another salad. He said ok, sorry, blah blah, and left us alone. Phew! And then some girl we haven't seen before arrives to the table a few minutes later with a salad! (I'm like so exhausted about this salad already). We declined this one too.... but seriously it should never have happened. Manager, communicate with your staff. Listen to the customer. Now you just wasted a perfectly good salad.The brussel sprouts were awesome, and despite coming in a ""rather small bowl"" according the waiter, it was plenty big! I could have eaten about 3/4 of a bowl for a normal dinner by itself and been satisfied.See part 2...",7,2,2,Meagan S.,"San Diego, CA",15,220,123
5.0,9/24/2013,"I don't even know where to begin:1. Interior is great, the restaurant is spacious and nicely designed. It has a lounge/bar area and a restaurant area. Lots and lots of mirrors. Honestly, I got lost on the way out of their unisex (i think) bathroom. If it's not unisex, it means I got lost in the men's bathroom...oh gosh! So yeah, I was just standing in front of one of the doors laughing at myself because I ended up getting lost in a bathroom with a bunch of mirrors! How ridiculous is that! Same happened to my bf! That made our day!2. Food. My friend is middle eastern and he knows how middle eastern food is supposed to taste. We ordered a bunch of appetizers (6 or 8) and basically ""inhaled"" each of them. They were sooo yummy! We also ordered knafah (or kunafeh) that is normally being made from scratch upon ordering and is served with a sugar syrup on top. Well, the ilili's knafah seems to be the best we have ever tried. Both of us. It comes with an orange blossom syrup which makes it absolutely delicious!Our waitress also mentioned that one of their regulars travels from Philly once a month to eat knafah and order one to go. Quite a commitment let me tell you! 3. Service is awesome. Our waitress was very friendly and outgoing. We absolutely loved her!Here is the verdict: my middle eastern friend said the food tastes like nothing he ever tried before and the place is worth talking about for years!

4.0,9/13/2013,"This Nuevo Lebanese place was a nice surprise. I dined with someone who has traveled extensively in Lebanon and he was equally impressed. First the space itself. I'm not really a fan of small and cramped NYC dining, but they did their best to use a weird shaped building. Bar area is separate from main dining space and they also had a cool, but tight area for more intimate dining. The bathroom area was way cool, but could have been more clean. The service was cordial and our server knew all the ingredients as well as the prep methods the cools used. Very impressive, yet expected when paying these prices. Finally, the food. We ordered tapas style and ended up with an eclectic mix of the menu. Tradition spreads were great, falafel was uniquely good, and my citrus trout was fantastic. I could not have cooked it better myself and I am know for trout dishes. My friends shared the mixed grill and all meats were charred to perfection outside yet juicy on the inside.

5.0,9/12/2013,"Alright, so I made a reservation for three on a warm Tuesday night in August, craving some Middle Eastern and completely oblivious that ilili was participating in Restaurant Week and was somewhat surprised to find out that ilili was participating in it when I arrived for the reservation! Now for most restaurants, a RW review usually meant a star or so less than usual, but I have to say that I was absolutely impressed with ilili! This was by far the best Restaurant Week restaurant I've been to!Most RW meals leave the diner hungry, but ilili lets each diner pick two appetizers, one main, and one dessert. Going there with a party of three meant we got to try most of the dishes on the RW menu, and there were enough leftovers to bring home as well.Unfortunately, I don't remember most of the dishes, but what turned a delicious dinner into an absolutely wonderful meal was our server Alexande. He took his time and explained the dishes, the best way to have them, and was as much an entertainer as he was a waiter. My main criteria for 4 or 5 stars is simple: will I go back again on a more regular basis?

1.0,9/12/2013,"A very first time in my life I've experienced the charge for a a glass of a regular water ! Wow! they called it a bottled water, or whatever , but this is a regular kitchen water that you pay $5 for! Incredible! When you pay $64 for meat combo at the place ( normally $17-$25 at other places) , even that seems to be OK, but to pay $5 to drink a regular water ( they call it ""filtered"" water ) seemed weird to say the least. Obviously the management lost a control over their desire to make an unreasonable 2000000% of profit! oh, well. At least they should of tell you , that you've been charged for a smelly glass of water , but NO! The waiter just tried to make a sale without letting you know in advance, you're being charged for that! the management refused to comment. Will send this to consumer affairs to find out their opinion on it. Oh, the food? Spicy , sometime unreasonably spicy and salted over the top. Other than that - solid 3 stars for the meat , 2 - for the tasteless  fish ( side vegetables have been charged for separately! ) , 1- for not telling us that we've been charged for water , and the same 1 for the service ( they changed the waiter 2 times during out dinner) Will never come back , but perhaps sanitation department would be interested to take a look at that 'filter' system that magically turns a glass of stinky kitchen water into $5/glass one.",6,0,0,Igster B.,"New York, NY",0,3,0

I got the Mekanek Egg Manouche (forgive me if I spelled it wrong) and it resembled a pizza but with lamb pieces and three eggs on top. It was pretty heavy and actually, out of the three dishes we got, it was my least favorite. I liked the taste at first but found it harder and harder to chew down as I ate. On the other hand, the lamb dip and lamb shank that my parents ordered felt easier on the mouth and stomach. They were delicious! The hummus and Batata Harra were pretty scrumptious as well but I couldn't handle the Rosti. It was too hard, which made it nearly impossible to eat.

4.0,9/1/2013,"Damn.  This was just a random dinner I had with some friends--I was even reluctant to go as I was feeling sick with a stomachache, but damn.  I was so impressed.Service was fantastic albeit a bit slow (but that's kay since we had a sizable group).  Our server was really accommodating for my gluten allergy and even brought me surprise crudites (just some nicely cut veggies, salt, and olive oil--though I couldn't eat much since I was already stuffed by that point) since I couldn't have the pita bread.  I was like d'awww.Bone marrow - I love bone marrow and make it at home.  This wasn't anything unique, but there really isn't a way to dress up marrow and make it better than it is.  So yeah.  There were many more pieces of bone than I expected, but the marrow on each was kind of sparse.  Still, tasty. Probably wouldn't get it unless you haven't had bone marrow or are craving it.Chicken livers - This was ok, but it tasted more like meat candy due to the molasses.Octopus w/ salad - The octopus was deliciously tender, but still firm.  The lamb that came with it was fantaastic. Ohh so juicy.  The salad was nice and the right amount of brightness.Dandelion salad - pretty good, only tried a bit.  Brussel sprouts were beter.Lamb shoulder - Not bad--they are lettuce cup style and comes with (butter?) lettuce, some garlicy mash to smear it with (unsure of the veg--but daaamn it was tasty), and some citrus wedges. It was a bit leaner and less flavorful than I expected but still quite good (I preferred the lamb that came with the octopus though).Lamb chops - not bad either, but I feel like it's hard to mess this up.  I love lamb chops, so yeah.Brussel sprouts - Sooo good. Get it.  The yogurt is flavorful and the nuts add a terrific crunch.  The fig jam and grapes do well to cut the slight bitterness brussel sprouts have. Do note if you are very sensitive to gluten, they fry this (and the cauliflower dish) in the same oil as some of their gluten dishes (my server is awesome).Meatballs - wow soo soft and delicious.  would get again.",0,0,0,Xue H.,"San Francisco, CA",182,294,311

4.0,8/31/2013,"I had been wanting to try ilili for quite some time and finally had the chance to for happy hour prior to attending a play in the area. The inside is atypical from what I'm used to when it comes to Middle Eastern fare. It's a highly industrialized space: lots of wood panelling, high ceilings, and exposed piping. The only signs that would suggest a twist of the Orient was the plum fabrics in the lounge and the general warm color scheme throughout. The overall impersonal decor and layout is what forced me to drop my rating down to a 4 star.I ordered the From Beirut with Passion cocktail, which is a basil-cilantro-mint infused vodka with some sparkling passion fruit. It was really refreshing; not too sweet and the size of the cup it was served in was quite large given the fact it was only $7. I also munched on some of the Rkaykat bil Jibneh (think Turkish sigara boregis). They were perfectly crispy on the outside with a great blend of kashkaval, feta, and mint on the inside. All in all, ilili makes for a romantic spot to see and be seen, regardless of the Ikea meets Lebanon ambiance.

4.0,8/26/2013,"Delicious!!So this review may be skewed because it was during the madness of restaurant week. I went with a large group-there were twenty of us divided into two tables. One table was served promptly and mine...well was about ten minutes behind the other. The food presentation was unoriginal, except for the falafel which came out in cubes. We had a variety of appetizers. I would definitely recommend the red pepper, kibbeh nayeh, cauliflower, eggplant, falafel and wouldn't do the watercress salad again.The lamb shank was delicious but came out as a piece of shredded (because it was so amazingly tender) lamb on one plate and two little pieces of cabbage + yogurt + citrus to wrap the lamb in. DO IT. It was so flavorful despite looking rather dull. The vegetarian entree option, the fate, was bland (make sure you mix it). We also tried the candy bar and the cheesecake both of which I would highly recommend, especially the candy bar which was not too sweet or chocolatey, but had a lot of layers of flavor.The atmosphere was interesting for a middle eastern restaurant because it seemed more Asian with sliding doors and the bathrooms more ying and yang. The music was really loud so it wars hard to talk but made it feel more fun.I wouldn't rush to eat here again but if in the area definitely stop there for a good meal.",1,1,1,Yassmin A.,"New York, NY",29,46,25

It's served with semolina tots and sauteed tomatoes.  The side dishes for our table were the well Yelped brussel sprouts, hummus, bone marrow, cheese eggroll type dish.  Endless baskets of puffy pita bread ensure you will be full.  We had a bottle of Lebanese wine recommended by the waitress.  This was a very good meal.",0,0,0,Dave S.,"Torrance, CA",2,604,485
4.0,8/23/2013,"Got here before my friend so decided to sit at the bar. Pretty affordable HH selection. I love cocktails and at $7 a pop, I was in heaven. The ambience to start was trendy to start but their lounge exuded quite a bit of intimacy with its plush banquettes for a nice start to a date or group chat-up with gf's/gay husbands. As soon as my friend arrived, we were quickly shown to our seats. The dining area consists of what I think is the uber sexy main room with its wood encased ceiling and the ""back area"" where smaller parties are corralled with its white tablecloths yet minimalistic design scheme. I suppose I'm a tad bitter over missing out on the main dining room but after trying the food, I wouldn't have cared if I was served out back by the dumpster. The menu was divided by mezze options and mains. Typical middle eastern/Mediterranean fare with new twists, we decided to sample the falafel and the beef kibbe (I think) as appetizers and for our mains, I went with the lamb kebab served over fennel and eggplant and my friend opted for the branzino a la plancha.  We split a side of roasted potatoes between us. The wait was minimal and boy were we surprised to find the traditional round falafel to take on a cubed shape. Delicious!  Crisp on the outside, light and moist on the inside. The kibbe was sort of a beef and barley fritter that was equally amazeballs!  My friend's fish was cooked really well with a crisp skin with a sauce that was both sweet and tart. My lamb kebab I must admit was just okay. Although I asked for well the dish came out medium and was not in the least bit tender. The flavor was spot on and because I was still googly eyes over our apps, I let this entree slide. For dessert we had the labne cheesecake which was served with a strawberry-rose water sorbet, pickled rhubarb, some weird jelly bits. I personally don't like fruit mixed with pastries and cheesecake is not on my top list but it was generally good. My friend, the birthday boy, loved it so it didn't detract from my overall dinner and I was fine eating cheesecake made from yogurt (weird!). All in all, if I were to come back I'd go a little more wild with the mezze options and avoid the mains. I loved the twists on traditional Lebanese food and was happy to share it with good company.

The crowd is trendy.  Everyone is well-dressed, neat-casual to stylish, business casual. We came here for Restaurant Week on Tuesday, August 13, 2013 to celebrate my last day of freedom before my new job.  Our reservation was at 8:15. We arrived 5 min late.  I called beforehand and they were really nice about it.  We waited a few more minutes when we arrived, which was not a big deal.  It was actually a good break for us to take in the surroundings for our first time there.  You won't notice at first, but to your left in the waiting hall is a secret closet to hang your purse and/or coat.  It is very noisy here.  You can definitely still talk and not have to project though.      APPETIZERS: Betw my date and I, we had the appetizers chicken livers, calamari, grilled octopus and the tuna belly.  Get the chicken livers if you're adventurous.  I usually feel indifferent to chicken liver but these wear delicious!  I would definitely order it again.  Calamari, not the best i've ever had.  Grilled octopus was my date's favorite.  The tuna belly was a fave for both of us and we would also order again.  Apps come with a basket of warm pita bread.The appetizers were sizeable portions not tiny like you'd expect from such a fine dining restaurant.  Two appetizers plus a cocktail can be my lunch.  DINNER: My date had the Rib Eye which he appreciated.  I had the Branzino a La Plancha.   I usually stray from fish in restaurants bc it really spoils my evening to have disappointing fish plus I always compare it to my home-cooked, Viet fish dishes, but I really craved it that night.  As well, seafood in Mediterranean culture is usually better (they just do it right). It was a nice restaurant that gained my trust thru the appetizers so I decided to go through with it. I couldn't have been more pleased.  It tasted just like my mom's fried fish!  My dad used to go fishing a lot and brought home fresh fish.  The fish skin is a thin, perfect crisp, the flesh moist, with a great orange fruit and celery salsa to boot. DESSERT:  I had the Ashta and my date had the ilili candy bar.  This is how it pretty much worked out:(1/5th of the way into my Ashta) ""Mmm...I never want this flavor to end! It's like moon cake ice cream!""Our server, Lauryn lights up: Wow, I've never had moon cake ice cream.""Ah, that's bc it doesn't exist. It's just what my dish tastes like."" (I go into explaining the tradition of Chinese moon cake and we go into discussing the ingredients and their flavors.)Dung: (1/5th of the way through his chocolate ""bar""-- fyi, a Yelper had described this as a ""chocoholic's wet dream."")D: Oh...MY...GOD.

3.0,8/13/2013,"This review is for Happy Hour only. I came to ilili with a few friends and my fiance for happy hour drinks on a weekday evening. Overall we were pretty underwhelmed with the whole experience. The happy hour menu does not offer much selection at all. The prices are nothing to get excited about, their happy hour prices are similar to many bars' regular prices. The beer choices are terrible - only two to choose from and both tasted like a watery, generic, Budweiser-type beer. The wine selection wasn't exciting either, also only a couple of options and both were the house wines. The largest section of the happy hour menu was the cocktails. I had a Black, Blue, & Bubbles, made of blueberry vodka, blackberry lime sorbet, and cava. I loved my drink - it wasn't boozy at all, but sweet, fruity, and fizzy. My friends were pleased with their cocktails as well. Ilili earns one star for serving up delicious cocktails, even if the prices aren't ""happy-hour-low"" as I expected.Another star for the staff - our bartender was very attentive to us and totally friendly - not to mention apologetic about the poor selection.",0,1,0,Kimberly H.,"Fayetteville, NC",119,167,0

We were able to try all the appetizers on the menu. We started the meal with a tasting of rose and it was literally a tasting. Most of the items listed were delicious, and it really started the meal out right. For the main dish, I had the cod and it was so good. Cooked perfectly and while it was a small piece, it was delicious. My friend paid the $9 for the lamb chops and while it was good, it definitely wasn't worth it. Stick to the menu, don't get anything with a supplemental fee. For dessert, we had one of everything on the menu and I liked the cheesecake the best. The candy bar was a little too chocolatey for me and the clotted cream tasted like soap. Not exactly my kind of dessert, but the cheesecake was the best of the three. The waitress was good, but she seemed a little snotty. She knew we were here for restaurant week and while she answered our questions, she seemed to have this attitude where she was just doing her job, but didn't think we were good enough to be at the restaurant. A little slow with a few things, but she got the job done. While the food was good and the restaurant looked amazing, I don't think I'd come back.

I could see why people would not consider this a great date place since it's so noisy.The best appetizers were the hummus, falafel and calamari. I love moussaka but this version was nothing like what I had in Greece.

2.0,7/23/2013,"It was ok, but I was not impressed at all.  Let's just say, that once we were all done, my party decided to go to another bar for an after dinner drink instead of staying here, and no one was talking about the food.  In fact, it was one of the few times with my friends that we actually had to sit and go through the bill - it seemed very high for how little we got, even for us making good money and being used to eating at good places in the area.The restaurant's decor is its highlight.  The drinks are OK.  But if you are charging $14/glass, at least put it in a medium sized glass!  Why be so stingy.  There is an attendant in the bathroom, which is really awkward, because she doesn't have any soaps, colognes, or anything to offer.  She just sits there folding towels.  Its like having someone go to the bathroom with you, literally.  But yet there is a tip bowl - for what?!  The portions are very small, and the food is pretty bland.  Yes, it is fresh and authentic, but it is bland.  Cooks - put more effort into updating your recipes.  When I cook fish at home, its fine if its not the best, but If I pay $30 for a tiny portion  at Ilili's, I'd expect the cook to put some sort of sauce or something on it.  No - it is just bland.As per the service, it is ok, but they do what I hate - they talk up certain appetizers and dishes like they are so great - the waiter says ""mmm mmm mmm I can't get enough of that,"" and then I stupidly order it and it is not good.  Ilili - train your staff to not employ cheap sales tactics.  Your clientele is not cheap and needs to be treated with a little respect.That said - and this one is no Ilili's fault - go here only if you are shallow enough to eat out just for the downtown young ambiance.  The table to my left was comprised of 25yo girls ""bragging"" about how it was cool to grow up in Manhattan and not know how to drive, as if life was some big episode of Absolutely Fabulous (and they are so close minded that they don't realize how much cooler it is to grow out OUTSIDE of NYC, but that is a whole other story).  On the other side were seated a few noveau riche that also talked about their money, vacations, etc. with a forced blase attitude.  I am the type of person that appreciates others being themselves and being real, and did not find it relaxing to have to listen to such vapid conversations all evening.My final recommendations to management: 1) work on your menu - offer something that knocks the taste buds off of someone, and 2) don't rely on your location.  Yes, people come in because of the location, but they won't be coming back because of the location.  You need to offer more.",1,0,0,Steve G.,"Brooklyn, NY",16,36,0

5.0,7/20/2013,"Found this restaurant when a friend was visiting New York. Just wanted something different near the Flatiron District. The reviews definitely panned out, because not only did I take my visiting friend there, but I took my best friend there for her birthday, and this week took my husband there for a quiet couple's lunch. First, the ""From Beirut with Passion"" cocktail is a must have! Great to sip on while waiting for your meal. The Warm Eggplant is one of my favorite dishes. Beef Fried Kibbeh, Hummus with warm pine nuts, and Black Iron Shrimp were our additional orders. The small plates were just the right size for two people at lunch time. Everything hit the mark with my husband which was a definite plus. But then for the first time, I decided to order dessert. I had the delicious restaurant made sample of three flavored sorbets with the arak foam. My husband (or should I say I) ordered the Brioche Banana Bread Pudding (which was no longer going to be served at the restaurant after this month) which was just as delicious. The portion of the desserts was also perfect because you can enjoy it without feeling too guilty. The waiter was extremely friendly and helpful with the menu, and took his time explaining the ingredients and the way some of the dishes were cooked. He knew that menu inside out. The staff is very friendly and attentive. The only negative thing I could possibly say about ilili is that sometimes due to the season, your favorite dish may not be available. :(    BUT I do definitely appreciate the freshness of the food and introduction of new dishes.

You can ask for the dressing on the side, which I might suggest because they put a bit much on mine. Portions were generous--I had to share the brussels sprout dish, and even then we didn't finish it. The salad was also very sizeable, and I wasn't able to finish it (which is saying something, because I can pack my food away quite nicely).Would love to go again, if I had the money.

4.0,7/7/2013,"Normally, I don't like Mediterranean/Middle Eastern Food. However, I have been to ilili (it's so fun to spell!) twice, once for lunch and once for dinner.Lunch was about two years ago, so I don't really recall what I ate...but, I know it was exotic and interesting, but nonetheless good! This past time that I went, we were brought to the upstairs dining area - which is a lot more intimate and quieter compared to the cocktail mixer style of the downstairs dining area. So, if you're on a dinner date...take an upstairs table. But, if you're single and ready to mingle, the downstairs area is highly recommended! Our waitress was extremely helpful and recommended that we get a few appetizer dishes and share rather than getting an entire entrée for each of us (which is big enough to feed 2). Typically, service people would push the more expensive dishes to get more tip. ""What is your most popular item on the menu?"" ""Oh, this one is really popular!"" - which is obviously the most expensive one as well... But, not here! Our waitress recommended the shawarma, hommous/hummus, octopus, and eggplant - which were all decently priced in the middle compared to the other dishes.The duck shawarma (2 wraps) was heavenly, savory, delicious, and just perfect!!! I would go back just for the shawarma.The hommous was also one of the freshest and best tasting hommous that I have ever had. I've tried a few in farmer's markets, Whole Foods, restaurants, and supermarkets... and I never found the appeal of hommous, but I decided to give it a try at ilili since it was a popular dish... and oh boy it was magnificent! It went really well with the pita bread. Octopus - I remember this dish being pretty good, but not entirely memorable, and probably a bit too salty for my taste. I would probably order 2 orders of duck shawarma in the future, and not the octopus again. I hate eggplant, but my friend wanted to try it... and I'm always open to trying new dishes even if it is of something I don't like. But this dish was delicious! It didn't even really have that typical eggplant taste, but it was cooked divinely that it tasted a bit like meat! ILILI! :) I love it!

4.0,7/6/2013,"This creative Lebanese/Mediterranean flatiron hot spot may have cooled a bit but that just means it is a bit more tolerable in the way noise level and reservations need not be made one month to the day in advance. This was my second Saturday night dining there and it lived up to expectations and our previous dining experience. The host was incredibly friendly and sat us promptly at 8pm when we arrived. Both the rose sangria and the blues, berries & bubbles cocktails were sure winners in the cocktail department. One of the many fun things about this place is the shared menu format. Hot and cold meze and main plates are categorized as vegetarian, fish, meat. We ordered the grilled octopus, tuna belly meze, the hindbeh-beautifully sautéed dandelion greens with pine nuts, the brussel sprouts (to die for), and the arugula Lebanese Thyme salad. All perfect...well seasoned, temperature appropriate. The highlight meze is the atayeh and veal bacon Bellini cum sliders...yum is really all I can say.The two main plates we enjoyed were the diver scallops and lobster hommos-both good, and nicely presented. They were both a bit rich particularly after all of the delicious hot and cold meze. The loup de mer and branzino and lamb dishes are still among my favorites. Too full for dessert...but we will be back. Fun vibe, spacious digs, attentive service. Great bar, Nice wine list and creative cocktails.

Service was quick and attentive by everyone.Food. We ordered apps of bone marrow - which was amazing and I highly recommend. Even for those that are like ""what? Bone marrow? No."" Trust me. It's yummmm! We also ordered the octopus, babaganoush, duck shawarma, salad, & the lamb shank. ALL equally delicious. However I think I coulda ate the bone marrow all day!

5.0,7/3/2013,"The food and service at ilili was absolutely amazing. My wife and I were in the area and randomly found ilili via Yelp, and we were lucky enough to get a table for two on a Friday night. The cuisine is Middle Eastern/Mediterrean but with a Lebanese driven menu. Our waiter, Corey D, was very knowledgable on the menu items with regards to the ingredients and origins; majority of the dishes we selected were strictly based on his recommendations. The menu has a large selection of mezzas as well as main entrees. Because it was only my wife and I we decided to just get a bunch of mezzas and skip the entrees, which turned out to be the better option since we got to experience so many different flavors. We ordered the following:* Fresh baked Pita - I've had fresh baked pita in the past, and I love it, ilili's fresh baked pita is amazing, and you just can't get the same quality from pre-made pita.* Homus w/ Jalapeno - its hummus, great tasting, not much to say here, for the jalapeno option they add a few fresh jalapeno slices on top.* Falalel - we were surprised to see square falalels, but don't let the shape fool you, these are great tasting falalels, crispy on the outside, moist and flavorful on the inside. Comes with a dipping side which enhances the flavor.* Brussel Sprouts - if there was only one thing to pick from the menu, its the brussel sprouts. These aren't your ordinary serving of brussel sprouts, they add fig, walnuts, grapes, mint yogurt to produce a dish that has an explosion of flavor in every bite. You simply CANNOT pass on the brussel sprouts, this is a required dish. Seriously, if you never liked brussel sprouts in the past you must try this dish, it you blow your taste buds.* LEHMAJEEN - this is best described as a lamb pita pizza. Its sounds weird, but definitely makes up for it in taste, Its a fairly simple dish but very tasty, comes with a side of taziki, and I recommend adding a little of the brussel sprouts as a topping on the pita slices.* Duck shawarma - they serve this is two ways, I think we opted for the cone style? In either case, not only was this the first time I ever had duck shawarma, but it was probably the best shawarma ever. Very tasty, and the cones are actually a decent serving size.Drinks: * From Beirut with Passion - my wife ordered this and she loved it* Wine - I had a Lebanese red wine, I forgot the name, but it was good* Mint Drink - I had one of the traditional palette cleansing drinks on the first page of the menu, can't remember what they're called, I had the one that was recommended by our waiter, which is the more popular one. Its a very interesting collection of flavors: mint, licorice, peppermint. I normally hate licorice, but all of the flavors in this drink are pretty subtle and do infact help cleanse the taste buds after each sip. I guess I would say its all part of the experience, I would recommend getting at least one serving and you can definitely share among two people.We'll definitely be going back, this time with more people so we can order more food and taste everything the menu has to offer.",0,0,0,Ketan P.,"Monroe Township, NJ",2,8,5

Once we arrived we were escorted to a side room on the main level, which looked like they'd just added it on. It had low ceilings, fluorescent lighting and we were seated facing dirty white tattered curtains. It lacked any ambience to say the least, and was less welcoming than my neighborhood joints. This room is pictured no where on their website.I politely asked the waiter if we could be moved. He brought the hostess over. I once again explained it was our anniversary, and we were expecting the elegant ambience that is conveyed on the Ilili website and asked to be moved. She declined to do so, saying the tables in the main room were only for larger parties even though they were half empty. At this point I was just frustrated as much by hostess' rude attitude and unwillingness to accomodate a special request on an anniversary as by the dismal settings, and we left.  There was no apology made on their end.For two busy working parents, for whom an evening out is a rare luxury, Ilili ruined our anniversary.

4.0,6/27/2013,"My party of three arrived early on a Sunday night without a reservation and were seated almost immediately. The staff was friendly, but our waiter did try to get us to spend as much money as possible. We tried the Poison Sumac Margarita (very tasty) but the waiter recommended we try a coconut-flavored tequila which ended up costing extra. When we asked if the coconut tequila was extra, though, the waiter skirted the question and made it seem like it would not increase the charge. For food, we tried two of the dips: the baba ghanouj and the moujadara. The baba ghanouj was delicious, although I thought it wasn't anything special. The moujadara was mild, but fresh albeit simple. Both are served with warm, puffy pita bread. Delicious. Before the food arrived we received a fresh-strained yogurt with some fried bread and black olives, a complimentary pre-meal course. For the mains, we sample from the different mezze. The warm eggplant in tamarind molasses was a favorite, not too oily and well-balanced flavors. The cheese rolls and shrimp mezze were also tasty. The waiter recommended Ilili's signature dish, the brussels sprouts, which came in fig jam and covered with grapes and walnuts. Although delicious, we were perturbed that the waiter recommended the most expensive vegetable, and the sauce was a little too sweet and overpowering for our taste. Overall, though, the service was fast and friendly. The food was delicious. The atmosphere was comfortable but also very cool. Definitely recommended.",1,0,0,Rebecca F.,"Philadelphia, PA",0,22,1

3.0,6/25/2013,"Sadly, my opinion of Ilili has come down a couple of notches. I continue to think the food, though expensive, is among the best of its type in the NYC area. But unfortunately the management has a bit too lofty an opinion of their stature and has adopted an increasingly hostile attitude towards BYO customers. Their formerly reasonable policy of $25 per bottle has been changed to $30 per bottle for the first 3 bottles, and then $50 thereafter. This is the case whether you are in a party of 3 or 10, which is manifestly unfair. This type of tiered corkage or ""sommelier fees"" is just thinly disguised gouging of wine drinkers. And I actually did order from their list from time to time, but on certain occasions fairly large groups of my wine friends and I like to show off our cellars, and they simply do not have wines on their list of the quality or maturity to mix into those events, and $50 corkage is far, far above what they can command to enjoy their restaurant.",0,0,0,David C.,"Manhattan, NY",0,114,2

Maybe I should have ordered something more elaborate. Ilili/the emporers new clothes!I got the wrap and when they told me it came with fried potatoes I asked for them on the side. The waitress contested saying it was only two thin slices. I said, ""i would like them on the side."" She fought with me and now there are a whole bunch of potatoes in the wrap not 2  like 6. I had expressed I wanted something light and not heavy. You are not suppossed to fight with your customers about the food they are paying for and ordering. The managers name is EVA TORRES. I feel sick now from the potatoes. What about i want the potatoes on the side was not understood? I was trying to be nice asking twice but she kept insisting. The only consolation was the yummy ginger-cucumber-mint lemonade and my waiter who later came to attend me, Rolando, he made things better and was super nice.  I would only give this place another try if the chef personally invited me in. I heard from so many people that it was great here. All i can say is the lebneh was great.

Food is FANTASTIC, an A+++I have yet to try everything (pretty close though), but so far each dish has been a home run, which is rare for me, as I'm a picky eater. Ilili has more of a communal feel when it comes to their dishes, they are a foodie place, so everyone at the table orders a few things and passes around, which works out very well because the abundance of variety in taste should be taken advantage of. The staff is top notch, service is excellent.If it's your first time, check out any of their lamb dishes. The mixed grill is excellent as well. Don't forget to order the baba ghannouj, it comes with an unlimited supply of fresh pita, one of their staples. Everyone has, at one point or another, eaten baba ghannouj, but nothing close to the way Ilili prepares theirs!Really the perfect place to try new things and reach out of your food comfort zone.

We had ordered the Brioche Banana Bread Pudding, it was impeccable. I am the type of person who likes to try a bite or two, so it was sized perfectly. However, if you have a huge sweet tooth and appetite; I suggest ordering your own due to the fact that the serving size is on the smaller side.The reason I am giving ilili four stars instead of five is because in the pictures with dim lighting, the ambience seems more upscale than how it actually was in person.

4.0,5/18/2013,"Being of lebanese origins, I can appreciate good lebanese food. In terms of authenticity, Ilili does a pretty good job at matching the quality of food served in Lebanon.We had a table for 2 when we went there. I would recommend upon arrival ordering a glass of Ksara Reserve du couvent, a delicious Lebanese red. If you feel like trying more unique Lebanese liquors, then I would recommend going for the Ksara Arak. Arak is pretty close to Raki (Turkish liquor) but is a bit more fruity in my opinion.The appetizers (a tapas style dishes) are to die for. The moujaddara, batata harra, rkakat bi jebne (cheese rolls), beef shawarma (a lebanese equivalent to gyro, served in 2 half sandwishes format) are really good. Typically, 2-3 plates per person are more than enough both to sample and to end up with a full stomach.The kebabs in my opinion are not up to lebanese standards, even though they are good. They come assorted with a selection of different toum mixes (toum=garlic in lebanese). Having said so, the person I was with found them delicious so the jury is still out on that.Finally, do not leave there before trying the knefe, a delicious cheese pie that will render you speechless (and probably needing an insulin injection afterwards).Overall I would recommend it highly based simply on food quality.

The host at the front even offered to store it in the kitchen for me and bring it out when needed. I have to say that the whole experience from beginning to end was wonderful. Our waiter was very nice. The food was fantastic we had several appetizers. The duck shawarma, hummus, beef dumplings, tabboule salad, and Brussels. Each was delicious and filling. I was very impressed with service when we had a slight incident with a drink spill. As our waiter was removing plates he accidentally knocked over my husbands drink. More our fault than his since the drink was directly in his path. Nevertheless they were quick and apologetic with clean up. The manager came personally to find out if I needed club soda and even offered to dry clean my clothes if I ever found any stains. Talk about amazing service. By the end of the night everyone was full and satisfied with their meals and the cake was brought out with candles. They even took it to the back and served cut pieces.

While I was not a fan of the setup in the large and small rooms at this restaurant, the bar area is actually kindda nice, so I definitely recommend that section over the other two.In regards to dinner, our server Miguel was great, so the service was very nice. At first I was surprised to see how expensive some of the dishes were, but since I am not much of a lamb/fish person, most of what I wanted was on the ""tapas"" section. Prior to getting our dishes, we did get a greek beer (it was okay) and a glass of red sangria, which some people just mess up, but this one was worth its price. We were give a bit of labne with crispy pita and it was to die for - loved it!As huge fans of hummus, we had to have it and it was really nice to get fresh sauteed jalapenos with it. The bread, wow, that fresh baby pita breads were really good. He found that they had a slight hint of cinnamon or something that was just different.We also tried the fattoush salad with the crispy pita, which is usually made wrong, but this was really good too. At this point we were full, but we still had to try a couple other dishes coming: kibbeh bi laban and the beef shawarma. The kibbeh bi laban was very interesting and diferent and I would have enjoyed it more if I had not been full, but it was really good. The beef shawarma was not what i expected, it was not like the stuff that is shaved off a pole of meat, but instead like little strips of beef - this was okay.Had a great dinner, so I will definitely go back and think you should try it too.",2,1,0,B D.,"Princeton Junction, West Windsor Township, NJ",7,99,7

3.0,4/9/2013,"So the first time I went to Ilili was fir happy hour and I thought that it was the greatest place on earth so I went there a second time this time for dinner and after tonight's outing I'm wondering if I was hallucinating the first time I was there!!! This three star rating incorporates many different aspects. First of all the decor downstairs is quite unimaginative and the only thing that separates it from a fancy hospital cafeteria is the dim lights. They've done nothing to create ambience or to express the culture of the food served there. I could wax on about the topic but then I wouldn't be able to move on to the hummus  which was just ok and the Brussels sprouts which they rave about to no end which again was while imaginative still just ok. Now on to the main course which was the lamb kebab, in hindsight I got exactly what I asked for.... But somehow I assumed there would be more of it. Instead I literally got a stick-less kebab and I do mean ""a"" as in singular... Just the one. What makes you understand the importance of this statement is the price attached to it, and the fact that I could have paid three dollars at the halal truck on the block and it would have tasted better. Ilili congrats. You fooled me. You're lack of ambience, high prices, semi-decent food and small portions is an unappealing combination that leaves alot to be desired.... Both figuratively and literally. Believe it or not I initially planned to do one star but then I remembered how much I loved your signature cocktail ""From Beirut with Passion"" and how amazing the waitress was!If you eat like a bird and enjoy expensive semi decent lebanese food go to Ilili for dinner, BUT ask for a table upstairs because the ambience includes a little more than dim lights and cafeteria table and chairs.

Weird falafel but I like it anyway. Props for offering watercress salad, since I love watercress. One word of caution: Do not, on pain of death, order the special orange blossom white tea -- it's like drinking perfume. I don't think it is tea.Hurray for available seating at any time of day or night (almost). The space is huge, and welcoming and warm with interesting wood paneling from floor to ceiling. There is an upstairs space and they once seated a party of about 10 with no reservation on Saturday night (shh)! I realize this was luck. It's best to make a reservation.

4.0,3/13/2013,"Finally able to synch-up our busy schedules, Lara G. and I swung by ilili the other night for happy hr in the lounge area there.  I got there a little early and was impressed by how friendly the staff was as they checked my coat and bags, and made sure I was comfortable.  The restaurant itself is beautiful, decorated with lush earth tones and cloth in warm colors.  As soon as Lara arrived, we checked out the happy hr menu which not only was quite reasonably priced--all of the food and drinks on it were under $10!--but offered so many delicious-sounding options.I ordered a St. Germain Cocktail which also had Cava in it.  I really enjoy St. Germain cocktails in general but this one was especially refreshing.  We ordered the Rkaykat Bil Ibneh and Katayet & Veal Bacon to share.  The Rkaykat Bil Ibneh (yes, I had to look that up on the ilili website to get the spelling right!) looked like cigar cookies but were filled with cheese and fresh mint leaves.  A savory treat!  The Katayet & Veal Bacon didn't contain any actual bacon and resembled sliders but on a pancake-like bread with smoky, thin pieces of veal inside.  As odd as it sounds, they were an epic delight as well.While I am not well-versed on Lebanese cuisine, I would definitely be interested in returning to ilili and perhaps eating in the main dining area.",1,0,1,Caroline B.,"New York, NY",457,1247,36

The first time I ate at ilili was for an event I threw with Dishcrawl. The goal was to have a tasting of what ilili had to offer and from the beginning, ilili was so welcoming and fantastic to work with. They put our group in the private room above the bar and Chef Philippe Massoud and Sous Chef Erik Osol met with us. Did I mention we were served a substantial serving of their lamb chops with zaatar salsa and three different tomatoes? It was a five star dining experience.I went back on two other separate occasions for dinner with friends and family. Let me just say ilili is a great place for group dining. The tables are round and can seat six (if not more) comfortably. You'd be dining family style and everyone can see and speak to each other. Plus there is plenty of space and the restaurant is huge. Reservations are the way to go but if you don't have one, it is easy to get a table early in the evening. You just have to promise to not hog the table for more than an hour and a half. It's plenty of time.The small plates are a delight. Some of the musts on my list are the hommus (perfectly smooth and creamy), fattoush salad (salad with crunchy pieces of toasted pita and a lemon vinaigrette - excellent in taste and texture), duck shawarma (Don't cut them into little pieces, order them whole and one per person. These are amazing and a treat to hold in your hand. It's like an ice cream cone of duck shawarma and even has a plastic holder to catch the fat drippings.), and the mixed grill platter. The mixed grill platter is a sampler of all their meat served with a trio of flavored whipped garlic. The garlic is a topping that makes the dish ALL THAT MUCH BETTER. I bet you haven't had anything like it before. We looked at it and thought it was gelato. I'd pass on the Phoenician Fries. Get the brussel sprouts instead.The dessert choices are so-so.  You will be satisfied with the savory dinner but if you happen to see the special rose macaron ice cream sandwich on the menu, then get it.

We got seated when everyone arrived, the dining room space has high ceilings and is gorgeous. Our waiter came over shortly to introduce himself and ""explained"" the menu. Honestly he was a bit overbearing and he admitted that too, we sat through his ""lecture"" before we placed our order. His best advice was - don't repeat any item because everything's tapas style and meant for sharing. Because of that we got to try so many dishes.Their RW menu gives you a choice of 2 apps, 1 entree and 1 dessert per person. So 4 of us had a total of 8 apps, 4 entrees and 4 desserts. The dishes kept coming and our table was full of food before you know it, I wished I took a picture but I was pigging out instead. They also set aside warm puffy pita bread to serve with the dishes, it's the simple things that make us happy! I liked almost everything but these are what I thought the highlights - Tuna Belly, Kebab Kerez, Glazed Yam, Cauliflower, Bass and Lamb Chops.

2.0,2/3/2013,"Overall disappointed. Food: not better than just regular low cost middle eastern food. A few of the dishes are fusion and supposed to be a special treatment of traditional dishes, but really they are just two random things put together that don't make any sense. For example, the lobster hummus on the menu is literally just some hummus with a few pieces of lobster meat placed on top of it- not that great.Cost: ends up being very expensive because you get a bunch of dishes/sides like hummus and labne for like $12-20 each. A dinner for two without alcohol can easily go over $200. Again, the food isn't really that much better than standard middle eastern fare (which is super inexpensive). Atmosphere: looks like a cafeteria. Enough said. Service: slow. Very high maintenance staff. When I get a prima donna host or waiter I find it extremely annoying. It's like random staff that work there are inconvenienced by your presence and needs to make sure they make it known via passive aggressiveness.

2.0,2/1/2013,"A $25 pri fixe menu with an appetizer, entree and dessert sounded like a steal until I actually sat down and came to this place. My meal consisted of the Phoenician Fries, ever-popular lamb burger, and labne cheesecake. The fries were served with a garlic whip and were average. The lamb burger was cooked very well and served with argula and cheese on an english muffin. It was decent but it needed something else (possibly Tobasco and ketchup). Dessert was average and tasted like key lime pie according to my fellow food connoisseurs. Overall, it was a sub-par meal that I would have rather spent on a liquid lunch. The hummus was definitely unique and well-made but I gave this place 2 stars because of it's service.I'm not going to go into much detail about my experience there because I don't like to complain but at one point my colleagues and I sat there with no service for 20 minutes while dining on our entree. No water, no attentive waiters, nothing. I for one found that completely disrespectful, which is probably why I never got my hot sauce and ketchup for my lamb burger.It could be that the water main break completely brought service to a grinding and embarrassing standstill but if that''s the case, don't take money I could have spent on perfectly, good and appetizing Jack Daniels and give me an excuse to boot.  Does the hummus and lamb remind you of eating in the streets of Abu Dhabi with your  mouth salivating while your hookah is slowly burning on the side? No it doesn't and sadly for ""sophisticated atmosphere where the ambiance and cuisine come together to create a new world for (my) senses to explore,"" Ilili had nothing for me to discover. :(",2,2,1,Deoroop M.,"Brooklyn, NY",185,219,317
3.0,2/1/2013,"I came here yesterday for the Restaurant Week lunch and I was a bit disappointed overall.  First off, do not come here unless you have at least an hour and a half to spare for lunch.  Their service is SO slow that there is no possible way you can do this during an hour lunch break.  I made a reservation for 1pm.  We were there at exactly one and it took them 15 minutes to seat us.  There were a number of empty tables while they lead us to our seats, perhaps they're understaffed for lunch?  It then took another 10 minutes for the server to come over and take our order.  Most people here ordered from the RW menu, so the server wasn't surprised that we were doing the same.  I mentioned I had a dairy allergy and our server recommended the hummus for a starter.  Sounds kind of boring, but he said it was really good - so I trusted him.  My friend ordered the lentil soup, which was very good (has yogurt in it, which is why I couldn't order it).It was a nice serving of hummus, enough to share with 2 to 4 people.  It came with 4 small, fresh pita breads.  The hummus itself was okay, nothing mind blowing.  It had a lot of olive oil in the middle.  Would have preferred it to be a bit more spicy.  My friend's lentil soup was very good, which chunks of lamb (I think).  Definitely more exciting than my hummus and pita bread.  For the entree, my friend went with the lamb dip and I asked if the braised lamb shank sandwich had any dairy - to which the server replied ""no"".The entree took about 20 minutes AFTER we got our appetizers.  At this point, we've been at the restaurant for an hour.  Thank goodness I had plenty of pita to work with to hold off my hunger.  My sandwich did indeed come with a giant dollop of yogurt.  At least it was an open faced sandwich, so I just discarded the top bun and ate the rest.  It was odd to have the sandwich come with a handful of mixed nuts - kind of a waste.  The lamb was very tender and tasty, we well as the fried eggplant and little bits of spicy pepper.  I did like it, but it was a little dry without some sort of sauce or condiment.  I guess the yogurt was supposed to add moisture to the sandwich?  I actually used the dip from my friend's sandwich to enhance my meal. The lamb dip looked really good.  It had a lot of bread, but it helped to soak up the very delicious bowl of lamb au jus.  My friend ended up discarding half her bread, it was just too much.  It was a nice portion for lunch, but it was definitely missing something.  Some nearby tables had these tasty looking fries that made me jealous.  ::tears::At this point we we've been in the restaurant for an hour and 20 minutes.  We had to ask our server for the check when he cleared the dishes and asked that our desserts be brought out as soon as possible.  Took another 10 minutes to get the desserts, but they were the best part of the meal.  The portions were ridiculously small, I'm talking about something that was 1 inch tall and 1 inch by 2 inches.  It was cute and delicious, but I ate it in 2 bites.  Quality versus quantity?Both desserts on the menu were great, I liked the chocolate ganache one better.  Overall it was an ""OK"" meal, but definitely not worth $25.  My hummus was worth about $5 and the sandwich was work maybe $7, with a dessert that small I wouldn't have paid more than $3.  So yeah, I feel a little ripped off and I wasted an hour and a half on this lunch.  The decor was nice and its super trendy inside, but this place is not taking restaurant week seriously.  Don't bother doing restaurant week if you're just going to turn people off with your slow service and lack-luster offerings.",2,1,0,Jaci H.,"Brooklyn, NY",116,301,33

WATERCRESS SALAD- Had some unique flavors. The yogurt cheese was interesting. I really liked the crunch of the walnuts.  FALAFEL- I've never seen such fancy falafels! They tasted like most any other I've tried though, which is amazing! Love chickpeas and anything fried.  GLAZED YAMS- These were amazing. The maple syrup made them taste even better.LAMB- I didn't try this. My friend said it was good, but he didn't finish the whole plate. BASS- Again was good but I wasn't blown away by it. Also was spicier than I had expected it would be. CANDY BAR- The smallest dessert I have ever seen but we were full and just wanted a taste anyway. How can you mess chocolate up?... It was great, had a little crunch too that I liked.  CHEESECAKE- Again, very small but just enoughOverall impression... there was more food than I could eat! You will definitely not leave here hungry. The service was fairly attentive. But there were times when the service felt slow (like when we initially sat down and were waiting to order) and other times where I felt we were rushed (in between courses). The ambiance is sexy/trendy. They break up the restaurant into three rooms. One lounge area where you can have drinks and small plates, good for a casual group get together. A main dining hall that's good for more formal group meals. And a third intimate room mostly reserved for couples.

Although we're actually right in the middle of winter restaurant week, we went on Saturday the one day that restaurant week isn't offered and thus ordered off the regular menu like some kind of beautiful, young, rich couple.I've never had Lebanese food before and Mediterranean isn't my specialty either so we ended up simply ordering random things we saw on Yelp reviews and tips. We ordered the Labne and the Moussaka. The Labne, a dip made from strained yougurt, wasn't that great in my opinion. It just tasted like sour cream to me. The Moussaka, an eggplant based spread, was more to my liking with its strong garlicky flavor. My girlfriend preferred the Labne but she never liked vegetables anyway so her opinion is irrelevant =PFor our main course we ordered  the Duck Shawarma and the Lamb Chops. The duck came as a tasty wrap. However the lamb was the clear winner of the night. It was so luscious and perfectly fatty. The only down side of it was that there were only three to the plate and I almost felt bad taking the last one for myself.",3,1,2,P C.,"Brooklyn, NY",235,206,145
4.0,1/28/2013,"I came here for Restaurant Week with a couple of friends.  I have had Mediterranean cuisine before but never Lebenese inspired food.  Overall, I had a pretty good experience here.  The decor was very nice, the food was decent, and the waiters were friendly.  I ordered the following from the prix fix menu:1. For starters, we ordered the Whipped Chankleesh, the Mouhamara and the Phoenician Fries.  The Whipped Chankleesh was okay - it was really salty but I'm not sure if it was supposed to be like that or if they just made it really salty.  I would give this a 3/5.  The Mouhamara was unlike anything I've tried before but was really good.  It had a sweet nutty taste to it that I enjoyed.  I would give this a 4/5.  The Phoenician Fries were nothing too special, but they were good. I would give this a 4/5.2. For the entree, I got the Braised Lamb Shank.  This came in the form of a burger, which surprised me as I was expecting something different.  It was very good though.  I'm not the biggest fan of lamb because it can sometimes have a ""wild"" taste that I don't particularly enjoy.  However, they cooked it very well and the meat was very tender and didn't have a ""wild"" taste.  It was also extremely filling and I almost couldn't finish it!  I would give this a 4/5.3. For desserts, I got the Labne Cheese Cake.  It was a lot smaller than I imagined, but that's probably because I'm used to American restaurant's huge dessert portions.  It was pretty good, but nothing too special stood out to me. I would give this a 4/5.In terms of decor, it was very nicely designed with high ceilings and cool decorations throughout the restaurant.  I would give this a 4/5.Our waiter was also very friendly.  One of the staff members had told me the wrong information when I asked him about something on the menu, but it wasn't a big deal.  Overall, the service was a 4/5.So overall, I give the food, the decor and the service a 4/5.  I would recommend this place.",3,0,0,Catherine Z.,"Manhattan, NY",28,13,0

2.0,1/27/2013,"My has ilili fallen far from the top of my restaurant list. ilili was my favorite restaurant at the end of 2011. It was nice and spacious, which made it perfect for groups, and it had some great food and drinks at the right price. I had been there multiple times in 2011, and then Adam Platt of NY Magazine came out with his list of ""Where to Eat in 2012,"" which included ilili. It was all downhill from there. The service became significantly worse: much slower than before and every time I've gone there since the article, there's been some service screw up (e.g. charging me for eight appetizers when we only ordered four). In addition, $19+ for a cocktail? Please...they may charge that at Raines Law Room or Tocqueville, which I'm fine with, but it just doesn't make sense at ilili.All in all, although painful, I must say goodbye to ilili and their wonderful brussel sprouts and phoenician fries. I'll probably never go back as I think it's just not worth it anymore. For the same price point, I'd hit Bar Americain, The Bar Room at the Modern, or Nougatine all day over ilili.

4.0,1/25/2013,"Restaurant Week ReviewRW can be so fatal and they did it so well!The space is divided into the bar, large circular tables for groups downstairs, and smaller, more romantic tables in the balcony. I was happy to be sat in the slightly quieter upstairs with my friend B (as far from the freezing outdoors as possible) but would love to go back and hang out at the bar. For RW, we each got two appetizers, an entree, and a dessert. Additionally, their current Lebanon Wine Country special means we were greeted at our table with a tasting of Ixsir wine. The wine was OK (fruity to the nose, but much less flavorful in the mouth) but the gesture was lovely. Our server seemed just as friendly regardless of our RW menu choice and lack of alcoholic beverages.

The mouhamara and chicken livers really blew my mind. Served with light, poofy bread, everything seemed to get better and better as we ate! I honestly think the main courses were slightly underwhelming compared to how yum the appetizers were, but I'd bet it was the four options to which we were limited. The fish was well cooked, the lamb was good, but it seemed more standard fare. I plan on getting an appetizer (or two) and a drink at the bar sometime in the near future.

It consists of layered chocolate ganache, fruity caramel, crispy rice and buttery crust topped with candied pistachio.

They have good service, a great atmosphere, and knowledgable staff but what REALLY blew me away (and probably the most important part of any restaurant) was the food. We ordered the duck shawarma which was ABSOLUTELY delicious. The duck had this overabundance of flavor that paired beautifully with the sweet and tangy pomegranate. The lettuce added a little crunch, the pita was soft and fluffy....I can't say enough good things about the dish. It  comes with two shawarmas, wrapped nicely into cone shapes and are served in what seems to be a repurposed ice cream cone stand. It was very pretty, especially with the beautiful red pomegranate sitting nicely on top.  The brussel sprouts are also fantastic. I really enjoyed them. I've never really hated brussel sprouts like everyone else I know does, but they definitely aren't something I would get excited about on a menu.

4.0,1/6/2013,"More twists than an M. Night Shyamalan film.ilili is described as a contemporary Lebanese restaurant serving Mediterranean cuisine. Growing up with Mediterranean food and having been to a few Lebanese restaurants, I can confidently say that self-inflicted label attempts to categorize something that should be in a class of it's own.Five star worthy design, the main dining room is overwhelming in scale and contemporary grandeur. Lounge music (supposedly spun live) provided an ambient backdrop, but ilili's round tables are meant for large parties of 6-8 and with large parties comes long dinner conversations. Spaced out appropriately, the tables are far enough to provide a sense of privacy, while close enough to have your appetite provoked by a neighbors order.To start with, we tried a sampling of their cocktails. The Lebanese American, featuring Arak (a licorice tasting spirit) mixed with bourbon, mint, and fresh ginger. It was difficult to taste the bourbon, any subtleties of it's flavor were lost to the overpowering Arak, overall reminded me of a less limey mojito with a splash of absinthe. The Cedar Cider was deliciously confusing. It wasn't what I initially expected but after the first few sips the cider taste surfaced even thought the handful of muddled lemon wedges sitting at the bottom of the rocks glass remained perplexing. The most aesthetically interesting drink our party ordered was the Not So Bloody Mary. Served in a martini glass, this clear drink was garnished only by a small tomato and a slice of jalapeño pepper. Overall was similar to a bloody mary, but truly tasted like a peppered garden salad. We also tried the Fresh Medows, the Poison Sumac Margarita, and a few of their red wines. Everyone seemed pleased by their drinks, the Arak was too bold for me, but in all fairness they devote a full page of the menu to describing the flavor - my excuse, I was too distracted by the appetizer menu.Speaking of which, we ordered the following appetizers, listed in order of OMG to meh:-Katayef & Veal Bacon - wow, an explosion of happiness in your mouth; the veal bacon is held together by a silver dollar sized bread of pancake consistency and topped with a sweet glaze-Duck Shawarma - another incredible mix of flavors; flat bread cones stuffed with duck make for a filling and satisfying -Brussel Sprouts - bold charred & spiced sprouts mixed into a creamy yogurt sauce with grapes & walnuts; amazing mix of textures-Tuna Belly - the influence here felt more Japanese than Mediterranean, nonetheless I'm all for it and was very pleasantly surprised --- would order again versus wouldn't order again line ----Grilled Octopus - overall composition of the dish didn't feel right, underwhelming amount of octopus-Hummus - a great excuse for eating more of their delicious pita bread, not memorable on it's own-Kebab Kerez - small lamb & beef meatballs, over-spiced & dryEntrees:-Chicken Kebabs - two white meat chicken skewers crossed over their garlic whip; an intensely flavorful garlic dip -Lamb Shank - no knife needed tender, seasoned incredibly well and served with a light yogurt sauce; only complaint was the temperature could have been a little warmer-Bay Scallops - didn't try them, but the plate was cleaned, and they were recommended by our waitressSpeaking of which the wait staff treated us very well.

Fresh, sweet, complex and boozy. I'll be having that again!Pita bread before dinner -- piping hot and freshly baked. The table devoured the basket and they kept bringing new ones, each fresh and hot. Fattoush -- light, fresh, delicious.Baba Ghannouj and Moujadara dips -- both were creamy and absolutely perfect. The Baba Ghannouj was especially delicious. Arnabeet Mekle (cauliflower) -- perfectly roasted with perfect tahini. The texture was spot on and the taste was sublime.Risotto -- Not at all heavy, lots of vegetables (not at all overcooked), packed with flavorChicken Tauok Duo -- great. Phoencian fries -- crispy thick-cut fries with the most garlicky dip ever. Awesome.",2,0,0,Steph Y.,"Cambridge, MA",5,6,0

Get the arak only if you like anise (liquorice, sambuca, absinthe).We get many dishes to enjoy our meal tapas style:Brussel sprouts - very good, brussel sprouts and walnuts go well togetherFalafel - some of the best falafel i've ever hadJalpeno ""Hommus"" - easily the best hummus I've ever had, creamy and flavorfulMouhamara - delicious flavors, again highly recommendedMelted Haloumi - amazing haloumi, creamy, not too salty, and perfectly meltedWarm Eggplants - slightly sweet, slightly savory, slightly crispy, slightly chewy, all deliciousSemolina Gnocci - gnocci was very good and the sauce was light, airy, and creamy at the same timeLamb Shank Makloubeh - it was cooked very well, but we thought the flavors weren't amazing. We wish we'd ordered the lamb kebab insteadOverall, the food was excellent.Although the ambiance and noise level were awesome, I found the seats rather uncomfortable and the table small (a drink was even spilled because we were cramped).

The good - The ambiance, great lighting, decor. The brussel sprouts are fantastic as well as the lamb chops or skewers. The bar has a great mixture of cocktails.

3.0,12/1/2012,"I walk by ilili almost every day and at first had no interest in going.  After awhile though, it started to grow on me, and eventually I had to give it a shot.First of all, the space is huge.  The bar is gigantic and has plenty of room, as does the restaurant.  I'm not sure if they serve a full menu in the bar area, but people were definitely eating something.  We were promptly seated at the time of our reservation, so that was a huge plus.  The place was busy, but not packed.  We got a decent table, in the corner somewhere, and our server was very kind and attentive.  He suggested a couple different bottles of wine because the one we wanted was, of course, sold out.  I trusted his suggestion and it was a complete failure.  The wine was not good.  Not necessarily his fault, probably mine, but oh well.We ordered a bunch of dishes and shared them.  The hommus and grape leave appetizer were absolutely divine.  Obviously, we tried the Falafel and that was excellent as expected, especially for a Mediterranean-type place.  For the entree, we both shared the Pan Roasted Duck Breast, which was probably the best I've ever had!You're probably thinking....why the 3 stars?  Well, I'll tell you.  The whole experience at ilili was just average.  Nothing that special and a little overpriced.  They could have given us a better table (there were a couple available) and the bathrooms weren't that clean.  Also there were several unisex bathrooms, which was a bit confusing at the time.Maybe I'm just mad at myself for the horrible bottle of wine.",1,1,0,Adam K.,"New York, NY",61,106,0

Thank you for letting me taste the true succulence of tartar before becoming a vegetarian. This was by far the best restaurant experience I have ever had in my life and it's most certainly not because the waitress thought I was 15 years younger than I am. It's not. It's because absolutely everything we ordered off the menu was presented to us with detailed perfection topped only by the expression of flavor on my taste buds. Were I to photograph what we sampled, it would be called food porn; to describe the experience if ilili is, well, a Broadway show.

The rouget, by contrast, was the dish we liked the least. It's a pretty bony and oily fish. Given that it was also a small portion, I expected more for $60. The lamb kebab again were on the small side. They tasted good, but nothing special I would say.While the food was not as good as anticipated, the atmosphere was certainly enjoyable. We were lucky to score a table upstairs in the back. It was not only pleasantly quiet enough for a conversation, but the atmosphere was truly remarkable: Linen was hanging down, covering the walls and illuminated by lights behind.

To be frank, the mezzahs (appetizers) are definitely better than the entrees, so if you are sharing, please try the bone marrow, the chicken liver, and the hummus...all of which were amazing. The complimentary pita bread was toasty and warmed just right, and it went with everything we ordered.

He says he'd ask the chef if they can alter with the recipe and of course, we were rejected. And it was her birthday =(But that's okay. There were still a few things she could eat. Well: the warm eggplant was a tad runny, brussel sprouts too dry, the duck shawarma tasted like it was left over from two days ago, the bone marrow was too salty, the beef and lamb meatballs tasted only of lamb, the steak tartare was bland (maybe it was supposed to be but I do see spices on there and I had to eat all the jalapenos for flavor), the hindbeh was okay, but I guess the fries weren't too bad.I'm sorry but not a single item we ordered were to my standards.

The warm eggplant and beef fried kibbeh was also okay, but could be passed. I recommend the duck shawarma and lamb shoulder, both were great and very tasty. The meat was really juicy and tender. We also had the Phoenician fries, which came w/ a dip that you really can't have enough of.I also had one of their signature cocktails, From Beirut with Passion. It's a sour drink and pretty strong, but good if you like those kinds of drinks.For dessert, we ordered the pistachio financier and mixed baklava. If I had to pick one, I'd take the mixed baklava. Both were good though.I can't wait to come back to this place and try some other items on their menus. We ordered 6 of the small plates for 4 people instead of main dishes and came out pretty full. It's a little pricey, but all worth it in my opinion!",1,0,0,Vincent L.,"Forest Hills, Queens, NY",17,92,2

2.0,9/15/2012,"Ugh! Restaurant week! Visiting Ilili this time further reaffirms how much I dislike NYC's restaurant week. Why? Well because you go to normally great restaurants for a great price only to have a subpar meal and dining experience. (Do you really want to go to a 5-star restaurant to have roasted chicken?? I swear this is an option at many of the participating restaurant week restaurants.)I first visited Ilili about 2 years ago w/ my then boyfriend and his brother and sister-in-law. That visit was also for restaurant week, but that visit was surprisingly nice. Unlike most restaurants, Ilili offered almost their entire menu but at the restaurant week price. This was fantastic if you ask me, particularly because some of their entrées alone were the cost of the entire restaurant week cost. My entire party fully enjoyed this as the food was really good and the price couldn't be beat! Since then, I had been wanting to go again for restaurant week even though I overall dislike restaurant week as a whole.This was a bad idea.My now fiancé and I visited Ilili for this year's restaurant week. We did NOT get what we originally expected. What we did get, however, was the typical boring pre-fixe menu options (like 3-5 choices each for 1st and main course -- they had roasted chicken!! -- plus a pre-determined dessert) at the low pre-fixe price. My fiancé and I ordered the hummus (which was fine - not the best, not the worst... just fine), the steak tartare (recommended by our waiter and highly disliked by us), the moussaka (again, fine but not amazing), the lamb (do I have to repeat myself) and something else that I can't remember that I also wasn't amazed by. Overall, it was... subpar. And all the while, I was remembering my first experience and fully missing it. Where was the octopus and the other seafood that was in their first menu? And how were you giving people just chickpeas and pita for a main course??!ALSO, where we were seated this time was just awful! It was such a beautiful day outside. Once we got into the restaurant and were brought to our seat, however, our spirits were definitely dampered. Since we were a party of 2, we were brought to the back room. Unlike the main room which has beautiful paneling and high ceilings, this one was depressing. One side of the room didn't even have lights above the tables which made the overall feeling very dark (and not in a good way). The ceiling was low. There was absolutely no artwork or beauty of any kind on the walls. And the tables just felt so tight!Sad to say, but we will most likely never be back and especially not for restaurant week. The restaurant is in a non-exciting area that makes the trek at this point not worth it. And the food, while great the first time, was just... eh. I would definitely rather go back to my recent find Café Magodar, where the food had flavor and the price didn't empty my pockets.Sorry Ilili.

We asked to be moved downstairs only to be moved to ANOTHER room off to the side of the main dining room only to suffer from the same plight. They just didn't get the hint.

3.0,9/12/2012,"First of all, how does one even pronounce the name of this restaurant?! I didn't even try my hand at it, and just ended up texting ""illililiililili"".Came here for dinner on a Wednesday night @ 8pm. We had reservations, and good thing we did, too, because the place was packed! We ordered the following:1) Baba Ghannouj - everyone knows this staple! I LOVE EGGPLANT SO MUCH.2) Bone Marrow - so deliciously fatty. Paired it against the pita pillows.3) Meatballs - good. It's difficult to mess up meatballs.4) Ribeye Steak - good. Meat is ALWAYS a good choice.5) Chocolate Candy Bar for dessert - DON'T ORDER if you're ALLERGIC to PISTACHIOS6) A pitcher of rose sangria - MISTAKE!!! ABORT ABORT ABORT.The total bill came out to over $200. (I THINK? PURE GUESSTIMATION).The food was appetizing and well cooked, but I wouldn't go out on a limb and say it's the BEST Lebanese food I've ever had. But, I would concede that this is probably the nicest Lebanese restaurant I've been to. You're paying a premium for the ambiance as opposed to the quality of the food itself. That bathroom is huge; such prime real estate.The service could have been a little bit better. My waitress was too preoccupied most of the night, and didn't really KNOW the menu when I asked her to describe some of the dishes.My biggest gripe is the alcohol. When you're spending $50 on alcohol, you want it to meet your expectations. We ordered the pitcher of sangria for $46, on the premise that it would serve 6 people (I planned to drink 5 of those 6 cups). When the carafe came out, we looked at each other in disbelief, there was no way it would produce 6 servings. We were right... I think we milked 4 glasses out of it. Also, in retrospect, we should have stuck with the red sangria... rose sangria tastes like fruit juice to my alcohol-jaded palate.To be fair, I did come here as a 2nd dinner, so perhaps I wasn't hungry enough to appreciate the food fully. Therefore, I'm going to give this place one more shot and update my review. Until then, it'll have to deal with my mediocre 3 stars.",5,3,1,Teresa L.,"New York, NY",253,403,259

4.0,9/2/2012,"I love ilili and am a frequent customer. It's a huge place so there's never an issue getting a table. It has kind of a nightclub/lounge feel to it so it's not as intimate as most smaller places in the city but it's actually pretty versatile--it's great for groups and can also be a good date spot. I'm in love with the duck schwarma but I do have to add the asterisk that it's not always consistent. Usually it's amazing but sometimes it's not AS good because the duck can be dry. The bone marrow is also delicious and another fav. Definitely get it if you're adventurous and like fatty/decadent things. I think this place is great for brunch. They have an amazing prex fixe deal. $28 for:1) Coffee or juice2) Cava, mimosa, or bellini3) Entre4) SideIt's pretty much a no-brrainer and is hard to find a brunch deal at this caliber for the price. I had the awarma eggs (lamb confit with 3 poached eggs) for brunch today. I thought the lamb was a bit salty and it had a hard texture but maybe that's how confit is supposed to be? I've never had confit before so I don't have a basis for comparison. The eggs are always cooked beautifully, a great texture inside where it's not overly runny but not overcooked.

It was rather plain and lacked the energy and punch that fresh vegetables - simply prepared - can have this time of year.

Between the 3 of us in the party, we ordered Lamb shank burger which was delicious, a lamb burger and a lamb and egg pizza. Although we all ordered lamb, it is also because there is hardly any chicken on the menu (may be one chicken option).  Nevertheless, our food was delicious. The Garlic fries are to die for.. so yum!! The pre-fixe menu is good for brunch as it is reasonable. We also got side orders of Hummus, lamb sausage and what looked like  home fries. Everything was really good.

I had heard great things about the lebanese food and was hoping not to be dissapointed.For starters, the environment was definitely not my thing...it was very ""clubby"" as some of the other reviewers have mentioned and is VERY loud. What really bothered me was the lack of vegetarian options in the entree section of the restaurant week menu (only one dish, and it didn't seem very good), so I told the waitress that I would just order from the regular menu while the other 2 people I was with would do restaurant week.

2.0,8/16/2012,"To begin, this was one of my most frustrated dining experience ever! A restaurant is a place that should offer great foods, services, relaxation, and an opportunity for quality time catch-ups. At no given time, the customer should be compelled (or to have the the feeling of being compelled) to choose something against his/her wish as long as everything was within reasonable terms. But Ilili took these concepts and twisted them around to make customers dining experience as uncomfortable and as frustrating as it could be.I think everyone agrees that the purpose of a restaurant participating in a restaurant week event was that it could attract more customers with its more economical prefix menu and hope that along the way the customer would end up ordering more than what the prefix menu offers. We came to Ilili in a party of 8 on a busy Friday night. Ilili's interior was very impressive. The inner walls were aligned with long wooden beams arranged in crisscross patterns stretching to a very tall ceiling, giving the customers a very open-spaced experience. Combined with the warm, yellowish lamp bulbs, the entire place was like an old classic library. In fact, the restaurant was so spacious that it would hold large parties with ease. Like always, prior coming to the restaurant, I had already read the menu, but what I didn't know was that if a member of the party chose the prefix, then everyone else was forced to follow as well, no exception. Of course, you were still free to add whatever else you like other than the prefix menu, but that was the same as telling you that you must spend at least $35 a person! Fellow Yelpers, how ridiculous, absurd, and most of all disrespectful this was? I mean, if the food was on the menu and available for the night and the customer agreed with the price, then who the FUC* are you going to tell me what I could and could not order! When inquired why this restriction, our waitress simply said it was restaurant policy. Well restaurant policy my ass with this kind of shady answer! The only reason to enforce such compulsory requirement was so that Ilili could squeeze at least $35 out of everyone's pocket, in other words making sure the customer was not a freaking cheap bastard by sharing plates. For the night, we ended up paying over $450 for a party of 8, almost twice the amount of prefix price per person. Was that good enough for you, Ilili? Then there were the supplement charges. I would agree with other reviewers: what's the point of supplement charges if the total was close to the regular dish, especially when the prefix amount was tapas sized.The quality of food was thankfully not as nasty as their restriction. From the prefix menu we each chose our own share. We had a hummus with lamb, steak tar -tar, chicken liver, and falafel for appetizer, lamb shoulder and cod for entree from the prefix. In addition, I side-ordered a baba ghannouj and a duck sharwarma. The hummus with lamb was average, but the baba ghannouj was fantastic. This eggplant based dip had a dark smokey taste when combined with fresh pita bread and olive oil was just too irresistible. The steak tartar was a disappointment. At first we couldn't figure out what the hell it was, as it appeared to be a stick of uncooked Italian sausage without the casing. It was very disputable to call it a tartar rather than greasy corned beef. On the other hand the falafel was very flavorful, crunchy, and with enough spiciness to keep you wanting for more. Both prefix entrees and the duck sharwarma didn't live up to our expectation. The only credit these dishes could claim was on the intense flavors. The chef did a good job of locking the flavors in to the different types of meats. But the main issue was that the foods were overcooked. Both the duck and lamb were mushy and soggy with parts of meat that tasted like sponge. The cod was just simply over fried, so hard on the outside. Two of my friends, a couple, had ordered a rib-eye. I happened to steal a piece and it was well cooked, tender, juicy and flavorful. Well at least they could do something right.We had a very frustrating and expensive dinner at Ilili. The basic concept of RW was to attract more customers, but instead it had caused us so much trouble. would I ever want to come back again?

Lebanese cuisine is my favorite, and this place certainly did not disappoint.

In the end they brought out a dessert with a candle and I am still not sure if someone from my table ordered it or the staff just did it because I had mentioned in my reservation it was my birthday or because my group randomly sang happy birthday while eating our mezze. Anyway, I don't know, I had one too many ""From Beirut with Passion"" cocktails (must try!), but I was very happy nonetheless.The only downside, I feel like some of the staff, especially in the front area, take themselves a little too seriously. And so do maaaany of the guests in the restaurant. It's a shame, I think pretentious attitudes actually take away from the awesome essence of the place, and make it look like the kind of venue where people go to try hard to be something.Anyway, I can't wait to be back.

3.0,8/10/2012,"I hate places like these - where the food is amazing and the service leaves much to be desired. I'm gonna chalk it up to the fact that I received the ""Restaurant Week treatment"" and my waitress seemed to be new. With that said, I do see myself returning in the future to see if the food holds up and if the service improves when the restaurant is not overwhelmed by RW diners.The RW menu is a GREAT deal - TWO apps, an entree and dessert. My boyfriend and I also decided to order their brussel sprout appetizer off their a la carte menu to share due to the rave reviews about it. We were stuffed before our entrees came out. All of the appetizers and entrees we ordered were delicious. However, dessert was uninspiring and I wish they offered their ilili candy bar at dinner. With the plethora of tasty apps on our table, the night was off to a good start and we thought we were in for a fantastic experience. That's what we thought until they bought out our entrees WHILE WE STILL HAD 5 APPETIZERS ON OUR TABLE! They sent out the entrees WAY too early. Five appetizers between two diners, the kitchen should know better than to give us only 10 minutes to eat. It was quite an act to balance 5 appetizers, 2 entrees, 1 plate of accompanying garnishes for the lamb, the pita basket, a bottle of olive oil, 2 glasses of water, and 1 cocktail on our tiny 2 top table. The fact that the kitchen fired up our entrees way too early left a bitter taste on our tongues because we were hoping for a nice relaxing meal. Instead we felt extremely rushed and we were not able to thoroughly enjoy our food.Our waitress talked to us like we were children which was very annoying. She was also persistent in trying to get me to upgrade to top shelf vodka for my phoenician lemonade. When my drink came, there was no kick to it at all. My boyfriend doubted that there was even any vodka in it. For $12 a cocktail, ilili could surely afford to up the quality of their house vodka.I REALLY wanted to fall in love with ilili. I hope this was just an off night so I'll be back to see how the service fares when Restaurant Week is over.",2,0,0,Elizabeth M.,"Brooklyn, NY",11,280,161

4.0,8/8/2012,"Came here for restaurant week lunch which is basically a dessert for 2 bucks above their normal prix fixe lunch of $22.  Loved the starters especially the fries and the garlic whip they came with!  Chankleesh was interesting too- but strong so definitely ate a ton of pita bread to go with it.  Wasn't as much a fan of the entree and mixed drinks- both alcoholic and non (drinks were a bit on the strong side and a bit too quirky for me and braised lamb shank was a little bland especially after the appetizers).  Ashta for dessert though was really nice and light (not too sweet but great with my tea).  Beautiful restaurant, plenty of tables for lunch available.",0,0,0,Jessica T.,"Manhattan, NY",279,214,551
4.0,8/8/2012,"The food prepared at Ilili is delicious. I grew up eating Syrian food, and it takes a lot of talent to get it right. Some dishes here are fusion, some are true-to-style authentic. Mujaddara is a dish that's easy to mess up and turn into a goopy mess, so I was happy that the mujaddara here was as good as though it was prepared at home. Many of the dishes at Ilili are Lebanese, like Daoud Basha, for example, and Mouhamara and Chankleesh are Syrian by origin. Good thing it's called ""Mediterranean.""  I deducted one star for price--- turns out that for quality Levantine food you have to shell out a lot of cash.",0,0,0,Denise E.,"West New York, NJ",0,25,0
5.0,8/8/2012,"I been here twice for company-related events and loved both experiences.  It is an upscale, trendy place with simply decor. Waiters were friendly and responsive. Between both visits, we partially tried the whole menu as well as great wine list.During holiday season, large company events book up fast so plan ahead and book at least 2 months in advance if you want a party of 10+.  I worked with Robin and she made great food selections.  They have various prix-fixe menus, which is more than enough for family-style sharing portions.Suggestion: Brussel Sprouts, Duck Shawarma, Bone Marrow, Phoenician Fries, Falafel, citrus trout, various Hummus, various kebabs",1,0,0,Christina W.,"Elmhurst, NY",155,17,5

4.0,8/8/2012,"Oh, where to start--first off, I'm glad I spent 25 minutes convincing my dad to wear a button-down shirt before going here. His typical ""shorts and tshrit"" only demeanor wouldn't have flown. Pretty upscale, moderately hip place. Absolutely beautiful inside.My usual standby for great Lebanese food is Tanoreen in Bay Ridge, which is outstanding--so naturally, that's the metric I used for Ilili. We all got the restaurant week menu, which was pretty extensive.Our waitress, Cher (I think), explained that everything was for sharing, mix and match, etc., which is typically how dining Middle Eastern works. Some of the best service I've ever had in a restaurant, bar none. She was knowledgeable, attentive, and made plenty of suggestions.For appetizers, we decided we would each pick two (there were 3 of us) with no repeats, so we could taste everything. We got the hummus, falafel, fattoush, chankleesh, arnabeet mekle an the moussaka. The table was served fresh pita, which was excellent--clearly homemade, and hot right from the oven. Perfect texture, shape, size--and absolutely delicious! The hummus was alright--very basic, nothing special for this traditional Middle Eastern food. I sort of wished we had tried one of the flavors they offered, but whatever. Missed opportunity. The fattoush was also just okay--pretty much a salad with a light dressing and some pita chips. Again, nothing special.That was pretty much it for my ""meh"" complaints.The chankleesh was outstanding. Cher drizzled olive oil over it and broke it up. It was basically a small, layered dish of feta, onions, tomato and za'atar. It was...amazing. The feta wasn't too salty and was perfectly seasoned. the accompanying tomatoes were excellent. Ditto for the arnabeet mekle--perfectly fried cauliflower with some grated chili pepper on top. The tahini labne was awesome--the sesame paste flavor was a wonderful complement to the cauliflower. The falafel was a dressed-up version of the classic--they were cubes, not round patties, and were wonderful. There was a flavor in it i couldn't quite place, but I'm thinking soumac. Maybe. The last app was the moussaka, which was a far departure from the Greek version I was used to--cold, rich, and very flavorful. A clear winner.For dinner, we had the lamb shoulder, bass and the fatte (chickpea dish). The bass was cooked spectacularly well, with delicate, crispy outside. The sauteed peppers it was served in were amazing. I was blown away. The lamb shoulder was excellent, too, if a bit salty--it was almost like a lamb taco. You received a shredded bowl of lamb with a side of radishes, orange pieces, and bibb lettuce. I combined it in a pita with the minted whip--it was amazing. The whip complemented the saltiness for a delicious, delicious dish. For the fatte--perfectly-cooked chickpeas in a garlic-yogurt sauce with some pita chips made for a fairly light but delicious dish. Again, a winner.Dessert was some sort of chocolate cake with some whipped cream and chocolate mousse. I'm not normally a dessert person, but this was great. Total came to about $150, including 22% tip (and a beer) for three of us. A real winner.I want to give Ilili 5 stars, but the so-so hummus and fattoush make me go to 4. Sometimes, I wish yelp had half-stars so I could go 4.5. The real question, though, is would I go back not during restaurant week? Yes, in a heartbeat.",0,0,0,Dylan K.,"Philadelphia, PA",267,354,32

4.0,8/5/2012,"We were in New York during restaurant week, and thought they had one of the more interesting menus. Between the two of us, we shared the deep fried cauliflower, fattoush salad, moussaka, and kibbe as appetizers... and lamb chops and bass as entrees. All outstanding dishes. The sauce on the moussaka was our favorite! The bass came in an amazing warm and savory broth with a hint of spiciness. The lamb chops had a good sear--it was flavorful and juicy, but it isn't as 'lamby' as others we've had. Some might like that mildness, depending preference.  The one negative was that the plate for the lamb shank was too small and made it rather awkward to eat... the sprouts kept falling off the plate. Anyways, we paid around $100 for two of us. That's way expensive for our usual Mediterranean food, but it was a great dining experience and worth it!",0,0,0,Isabelle J.,"Minneapolis, MN",512,55,13
5.0,8/3/2012,"I've only been to ilili during lunch in the past for client meetings or business lunches and I've always wanted to try the place out for dinner and then rate it. Well, tonight, I finally did and was impressed!!To celebrate the company's e-commerce website launching today, I told my boss on Monday that we should have a company outing/dinner on Friday night to show appreciation to all the employees that worked so hard on the website the past few months.. She agreed and told me to book a place for a dinner. I thought this was the chance to try out this restaurant as I've always passed this place since it's close to work and have heard great things frrom a gazillion people that I know. So went on Yelp and made reservations using Open Table for 7:15pm on Friday.So after work, few of my co-workers and I arrive first to get settled in. We were greeted by the hostess and we were immediately seated to a nice table in the dining room. We were then greeted by a number of friendly servers (not our main server though) and they poured us water, and gave us the menu. After the rest of the party arrives, our main server comes and greets us. She was very friendly and attentive and had a constant smile on her face which made everyone feel comfortable. She was also very patient when we asked questions about the food and she gave us recommendations as well. When we told her we need more time to browse the menu, she said 'No problem, take your time' and gave a warm smile and walked away.After deciding what we wanted to order, the server arrived and we ordered the appetizers, drinks, and the entrees altogether. After about 5-8 minutes, the appetizers arrive as well as the cocktails we ordered. Everything was just so good and LOVED the fresh Lebanese bread that they offer!! So delish!! After we all devoured the appetizers, our server arrives to tell us that the kitchen is backed up right now and that she apologizes for the delay of some of the appetizers as well as the entrees. We told her know problem and the entree and the rest of the appetizers arrived about 10 minutes later. We all shared the different foods that we ordered and EVERYTHING was just so good and the portions were VERY generous!! Oh yeah, the drinks here are EXCELLENT and potent.We ordered the following:APPETIZERSMouhamara Dip (Walnuts/Sundried Peppers/Pomegranate Molasses)-This was everyone's favorite appetizer!! Spicy-sweet, nutty, and full of flavor, DO get this!!Labne Dip (Strained Yogurt/Olive Oil/Fresh Mint/Zaatar with Salmon Roe)-I thought it was going to be a bit too creamy but it was so fresh and light!!Phoenician Fries (Sumac/Parsely/Garlic Whip)-If you've been to Pommes Frites down in East Village, the fries are cut like that and the dip that accompanies it is absolutely good!!Riz (Lebanese Rice/Toasted Vermicelli/Mixed Nuts)-I know it's rice but this rice was sooo tasty and nutty!! Loved the flavor!!Rkaykat Bil/Ibneh (Cheese Rolls/Kashkaval/Feta/Fresh Mint)-They look like mini Chinese egg rolls. Kind of boring, skip this.Black Iron Shrimp (Jalapeno/Garlic/Cilantro)-This was another favorite. May not be totally Lebanese but these were good!!Bone Marrow (Sour Cherry Tabbouleh/Pita Pillows)-I got this because a Yelper mentioned it. They were good but too fatty/slimy for my taste. .ENTREESLamb Chops (Seared w/ Zaatar Salsa Verde Herb Roasted Tomatoes)-Three generous sized Lamb Chops that were perfectly cooked and tasty. The texture wasn't too soft nor too chewy but just right. Get it done MEDIUMBoneless Ribeye (Semolina Dumplings, Kouzbara, Scallion, Cherry Tomato)-The Most expensive Entree at $52 but SOO worth it!! This 20 oz Steak is HUGE!! And comes with decent amount of sides! It was so huge that my boss had to share it with two other people!!Beef Kebab (Bone Marrow & Sumac Onion Jam/Shishito Peppers)-My co-worker thought this was really good but kind of simple. Served in a long white ceramic plate. This one doesn't come with any sidesLobster Hommus (Lobster/Beurre Monte Honshimeji & Oyster Mushrooms)-If you're a hommus and lobster lover, DO get this!! But if you did order hummus as your appetizer beforehand, skip itAll the cocktails we ordered: Fresh Meadows, Phoenician Lemonade, and From Beirut w/ Passion were all so delicious and refreshing!! But definitely DO get the Beirut w/ Passion!!To finish off, we ordered coffee and Awaimat (Lebanese Beignet with Orange Blossom Simple Syrup) and Pistachio Financier (Banana Ice Cream/Tahini Fluff). Awaimat was rather boring but the latter was so good!!If you're looking for a semi-upscale place w/ superb service, excellent food and drinks, and great vibe, do come here!!  FYI, although dress code is ""Dressy"" I've seen people with casual clothing (e.g guys in shorts and button down shirt) Also, it's not a quiet, intimate kind of place. The noise level is medium. Will definitely return for dinner in the future!!",2,1,2,Old Fart M.,"Manhattan, NY",0,1148,11072
5.0,8/2/2012,"I came here for their restaurant week menu. While much of the RW menu included items with supplements ($4-15), it was still worth it. We started with the meatballs ($5 supplement), hummus, mussels ($4 supplement) and falafel. The lamb meatballs were disappointing and reminded me of Chef Boyardee. The falafel cubes were amazing, fried to perfection and with a great sauce. The mussels were fresh and flavorful. The hummus was light, and delicious.For entrees we ordered the lamb shoulder and rib eye ($15 supplement). I highly recommend both. I usually steer clear of lamb since I have an aversion to gameyness. This lame was not gamey at all, it came with a side of lettuce The ribeye was so tender and to die for. There was only one choice for dessert - chocolate brownie with whipped cream. It was very mediocre. I hear that the candy bar is really good and will have to try that next time.Ilili also has a great happy hour special that extends to 7:30pm. Cocktails are $7 and small plates range from $4 - $9.

4.0,8/2/2012,"Came here for RW and absolutely fell in love with the atmosphere!  The moment I stepped into Ilili, it was like I was transported away from the bustling streets of Manhattan.  Inside you'll find the lights are dimly lit with a soft yellow hue, sky high ceilings, a plethora of mirrors lining the walls, and most importantly, friends chatting and having a great time.  My friend and I were brought to the upstairs area to be seated (the staircase is a bit trippy due to the dim lighting + mirrors).  The tables are quite close to one another, but understandable due to the large influx of people they have.The staff at Ilili is phenomenal.  They were incredibly amicable, constantly ensuring our dishes were good and our waters were filled.  The food was fresh and tasty.  The best: unlimited pita bread!  They were incredibly soft and airy, and you could taste the just-out-of-the-oven goodness.   The good: tapas style eating!  Each person is able to choose 2 appetizers and 1 entrée.  (as an FYI - this restaurant allows you to substitute portions of the RW menu with other items, that have an added cost.  Make sure to check with your waiter if you didn't plan on spending over $35!)  Loved the chicken liver (tasted like liver, but had a sweet tang to it), eggplant, and chickpeas but wasn't a huge fan of the steak tartar appetizers.  The Lamb shoulder and sea bass entrees were also quite delectable, although not too sure what the orange thing was that came with the lamb shoulder (thought it was an orange but it was very sour).  The bad: they only had one option for dessert - chocolate cake!  Supposedly it was tasty, although a bit dry, but was complemented well with the dab of chocolate ganache and whip cream.  Unfortunately, chocolate isn't my thing so I had to skip on dessert, my fav meal :(I would most definitely come back to Ilili!  Not too sure if I'd come back for dinner since it seems quite pricey, but they do have HH here, so looking forward to trying that out sometime!",0,0,0,Cici L.,"Manhattan, NY",8,41,10
5.0,7/31/2012,"I'd heard lots of great things about ilili and just had to finally check it out for Restaurant Week. First of all, this place is huge, with half of it a bar, and then the dining area with tons of optical illusion-causing mirrors.Our waiter was great - friendly and funny though he wasn't too familiar with the beer menu (he couldn't tell me what type of beer some of them were). The RW menu was pretty extensive, with a choice of two appetizers from a big list of a ton of stuff that looked great. I decided upon the steak tartar and the falafel. The steak tartar tasted very fresh, and was presented as a rectangular prism. The falafel also came in cubes. I don't know what their deal is with shaping foods with corners, but the food was great either way.They will also give you an insane amount of pita bread fresh out of the oven.For my entree, I had the lamb shoulder , which came with slices of lettuce and a garlic puree sauce. The lamb was a bit salty, but throwing it into the lettuce and slathering the white sauce on it made it all disappear from my plate in no time.If I had to give a complaint, it's that the unisex bathroom was weird.

5.0,7/29/2012,"This place was amazing. Went with 10 people for a birthday dinner. We were definitely a more loud group but you wouldn't know it given the lively atmosphere of the section we were put in. But I'm getting ahead of myself. The first think to note is that they have round tables for large groups. I cannot explain how happy that made me. Being in the hospitality industry I completely understand the need for restaurants to avoid using round tables to increase the amount of revenue-generating space in their restaurant, but when I see round tables, they automatically get extra points. I LOVE being able to see and speak to everyone at my table, even in large groups.Ok now to the whole service/food aspect of the meal:Service: amazingly hospitable. Serving a rowdy group of 10 celebrating a 20-something birthday party is a feat for any service provider. Serving them all alcohol and food with ""service with a smile"" and being attentive, responsive and engaging with them I think should qualify them for sainthood. or some sort of Gandhi-esque descriptor. I think we had 2 servers, both of whom were were attractive, very informed and very happy to be engaged in discussions of what was good and how many of each thing we should order.Food:I wish I could remember everything we ordered because I seriously did not have a single thing I didn't like. I know we got a couple rounds of the regular and jalapeno HUMMUS which were amazing. The jalapenos were fresh and not pickled which gave it a different spice than the Sabra stuff I buy from the store (which i also love). Everyone else who has done a review of this restaurant is right: YOU MUST ORDER THE BRUSSEL SPROUTS! What is even more ridiculous is that we got 1 order at the end of the meal and had leftovers and they were STILL GOOD reheated! (granted I did it in the oven rather than the microwave but hey you have to give the food their due process. The brussel sprouts were crisp and savory and not super drenched in oil  and had spices that I loved. A little sweet, a good crunch, a delish savory earthy flavor. With the grapes and the walnuts and the yogurty sauce, it's like what foodie genius came up with this?! AHMAZING! TABBOULEH was very fresh and had a great lemony tang that I really enjoyed. Luckily I haven't had bad tabbouleh but unless it was sitting out for awhile, I'm not really sure how you mess that up. the FASSOULIAH (white bean salad) was also amazing. Don't think they used canned but if they did props to them. ARNABEET MEKLE (cauliflower) was also fantastic. It says it uses red chili but no one should be scared off by it. The heat from these chilis comes from the seeds but this was just more a peppery flavor enhancer. CHEESE ROLLS were not standard at all which means they were so much better. They are small bite-size pieces but they give you a decent amount (though its possible we got a double order and it came out on 1 plate). Something about greek style cheese just makes it a million times more delish than the stupid mozzarella sticks you can get anywhere else. Well the cheese and the Philo dough. WARM EGGPLANT: Growing up an Indian girl, I was force-fed a lot of eggplant as a kid that I hated. I have a great appreciation for the veggie now. This dish is by far one of the best eggplant dishes I have ever encountered. Cooked eggplant is typically really mushy and I still struggle with the consistency but this was so different. It was thinly sliced and had more of a cooked morel mushroom consistency. A little oilier when you recook but still so tasty. I am also partial to tamarind anything as an Indian girl. Oddly enough the FALAFEL was probably the least incredible thing on the menu but its worth it to note that I still enjoyed it. My mother makes hands down the best falafel possible for a non-Middle Eastern person and Ilili's rank third behind Taim's falafels. I might be a bit of a snob about falafel but well that's why I yelp.OK I know I went on and on about the vege items but we did order meat and fish as well! The BLACK IRON SHRIMP was well cooked and seasoned but kind of limited in comparison with everything else I ate. Probably would have loved it if I didn't have anything else but who goes to a Medi restaurant and only orders shrimp? TUNA BELLY was so rich but small enough bites to share and be content with a bite since there was so much other food coming. The lamb of the KAFTA was amazing but I didn't eat the beef the first time around. When I recooked it, it was a little too tough for my taste. If KAFTA on the menu is actually a combo of ground lamb and beef then I'm not talking about it. I am then referring to  the KEBOBS. Sorry, it definitely got to a point where I had no idea what I was tasting. I think it was the DUCK SHAWARMA that we ordered that came in these buns that reminded me of the buns used for pork buns? Sooo good! Well cooked and seasoned with spices and sauces that were well matched.",2,0,0,Amee S.,"Manhattan, NY",204,32,1

2.0,7/27/2012,"Went here to try the restaurant week, ilili became a well known mediterranean restaurant thought to check out for girls night out. We missed our reservation but the hostess got us in no problem. Everything was well when we got seated and the restaurant week consist of two appetizers per person and an entree. Since we had 5 ppl, the waiter said we can pick 10 appetizers to try. The appetizers were good, the pita bread kept coming, all is well. The sea bass as entree was dry and the dessert, chocolate cake was just as dead as the bass. Nothing to rave about since restaurant weeks are hit or miss. The bill came, 5 ppl equals 375 dollars not including tip. How for a restaurant week? Lambchop my friend order that was included in the restaurant week became 45 dollars, to realized they had all these supplemental fees to pretty much every restaurant week appetizer that wasn't hummus or spread. The entrees too also had supplemental fees we were not informed of by our waiter. We all had a drink or two max, and they were definitely over priced, but what is a restaurant week $35 dollar on top of supplemental fees,which would've been cheaper to order from the regular menu. We spoke to the waiter and he said so now we know there are supplemental fees when you go to other restaurant week, im like you were suppose to inform us of the supplemental fees which you failed to. Then i called the manager and he was like it's in the menu, would you like to show me how you can do it better with a snotty attitude. I said you can perfectly tell your staff to mention it to people who are doing restaurant week of supplemental fees on all items than all these tiny fonts we are suppose to try to read in the dark. I think this place is over rated for the price, from $35 per person restaurant week turned into $75 minimum is definitely not worth it for small platter of hummus. Be careful what you order here, it is definitely over priced and over rated with rude service. I would never go back or recommend it.----Per michael h feedback from ilili, supplemental allow you to try wide selection in cheaper price. How was our 45 dollar lambchop and 50 dollar ribeye after supplemental fee on top of Tuna belly and mussel we had to add additional 12 dollar for ordering both appetizer cheaper than your regular menu?",6,2,0,Luvlymui i.,"Roslyn, NY",20,86,1

4.0,7/25/2012,"Summer '12 RWI was a skeptic about the concept of fancy middle eastern food but now I am a firm believer of this delectable feast! I thank my sister for suggesting we go here for RW otherwise I wouldn't have thought to try it out. RW menu had a nice selection from their regular menu. You get to choose two mezzes and one main course dish and dessert is the same chocolate cake for everyone. One thing that I didn't like about the menu was that a lot of the items required a supplemental charge thus limiting the selection. But I guess you can consider it a good thing if you want to try one of their more expensive dishes while still participating in RW. MezzesChicken Liver - has the typical slightly bitter liver taste with soft texture. It is cooked in a pomegranate and lemon sauce so you can taste the slight sweetness of the fruit. It's served in a small cast iron skillet in a pool of buttery sauce. The portion is big enough for 3-4 people to have a good taste. Steak Tartar - made with good steak and served with herbs and radishes for a refreshing taste. The pour olive oil on top of the tartar at the table for you. Falafel- was a bit disappointing. Honestly I think some street vendors have far better falafels. Cauliflower - nice vegetable dish served with creamy tahini. EntreeBass - perfectly grilled big piece of bass on top of a bed of sauteed zucchini  served with spicy fish broth. It was a very good choice and made me very happy and full. ServiceI take off a star for the service. I could tell that the restaurant was very busy and the staff were not trained enough to accommodate the volume. I was served by 4 different servers covering each other and some of my requests got lost in communication. The table was not balanced and tilted this way and that way every time we moved but no one offered to address it.  Servers kept kicking on my chair when passing behind me. Our main course came out too early but our dessert came out extremely late. I was secretly hoping Gordon Ramsey to appear and start yelling at them about such inferior service.

It doesn't represent Middle Eastern food. Plus it's waaaay overpriced for it's portion sizes. Food doesn't taste bad though.

The pita they gave us with unnecessary and we left it untouched.  The duck wrap appetizers were amazingly delicious, and every bite made the pomegranate seesd burst with a sweetness that complimented the duck so perfect - it is one of the best things I ever had!  Our waitress also recommended the whole stuffed fish but that lacked flavor and was disappointing especially after such a stellar duck.All in all, I would def come back to try the lamb and the other appetizers that people are raving about!",0,0,0,Nona C.,"Bayside, Queens, NY",26,233,111

I tried to order the moussaka bc I thought that it was the same middle eastern one that im used to eating.. But alas, it was cold and did not have meat. No can do. So I opted for the fun stuff ont he menu like the chicken liver, sweet breads, and their popular item which was the katayef. the chicken liver was delicious... it was cooked correctly and was really flavorful. the sweetbreads were ok nothing to write home about. But the katayef! heaven!!! it was this nice and fluffy pancake filled with magical goodness!!! well, veal and veggies and sauce. lol. It certainly has to be their best seller. i also tried their tabbouleh. it was fresh and summery and light. Their sardines were also very good. Salty in a good way of course.. but so very fresh.Service was great, although they did mess up our bill twice. but the manager actually personally apoligized to us which was very nice.

2.0,7/6/2012,"ilili failed to impress me. For starters, the restaurant was fake-swanky, in a sense that it appeared nice but was really nothing more than cheap decor and dim lighting. The (white) cloth backdrop on the wall I faced was stained with wine, the chairs were flimsy and tables were squeezed in. This place would have worked when I was 22, but I'm a big girl now and I know the difference between a restaurant that is faking it and one that is not. My friend and I ordered several plates to share, including: hummus, tabbouleh, phoenician fries, black iron shrimp, chicken shish taouk and kebab kerez (lamb meatballs). The hummus was okay, but I've definitely had better pita mostly everywhere that I've had pita. The tabbouleh salad was all parsley. I'd only had this salad once before and I remembered parsley being one of the components, but in this case, I was eating a mouthful of the fragrant herb on every bite. If there was bulgur in there, it was an afterthought, because I definitely couldn't taste anything but parsley. The shrimp were a disappointment. They were small and lacked any sort of flavor from the broth they were in. I've had better shrimp in four dollar lemongrass soup from my Thai takeout joint. This dish cost us fifteen. The lamb meatballs weren't really my thing, but I will give props to the chicken and the fries. The chicken was juicy and well seasoned. The fries were delicious and had an awesome garlic dipping sauce. For dessert, we shared a plate of ""mixed"" baklava. I tasted no difference between the pieces, though they did end our dinner on a sweet note. Our server was spread thin between tables and we didn't see much of him besides when he took our order and dropped off some plates.

Towards the end, we were getting scared as more and more plates kept coming out.  we were wondering if the food was ever going to cease as we were all slaves to our gluttony. We started off with flatbread and 3 types of dip. The tabbouleh was so fresh and tasty. Then some falafel, brussel sprouts, and fries came out. I would reorder any of those again in a heartbeat! We got cheese rolls and octopus. Then all i remember is tons of meats. I believe we got some of the kibbeh and the mixed kebab plate. Lastly the trout, which was one of my favs of the night. I wish we had also gotten the bone marrow but that was not part of the prix fixe. It ended up with strained yogurt and bird's nest type of dessert, which was probably my least favorite thing of the night, but at that point, who cares I was too full to eat it anyways.

The place was full of energy and chic with patrons dressed up in suits and dresses. Such a different vibe from what I'm used to back home in San Francisco. In such a fashion conscious city, many people really do change out of work clothes to go out for dinner. We started off with crackers and a strained yogurt spread. As simple as this spread was it kinda blew my mind and we asked to keep it when they tried to clear empty plates before our dishes stated trickling in. We ordered a Hommus (i spell it hummus) and added pine nuts. The pita bread that accompanied it was amazingly fresh, fluffy and served hot! We used it to dip into that yogurt spread we asked to save. The hummus itself was pretty standard and in my opinion had a bit too much olive oil on top.I had the Farro Risotto with winter vegetables, parmesan and a carrot crisp which was quite delicious. It almost had too much risotto and not enough veggies if you ask me. Along with it a glass of Sauvignon Blanc. Husband had the Chicken Shish Taouk with marinated chicken breast, crispy chicken skin garlic whip and sumac onions. He finished it up in no time. He had this with a glass of Cabernet.

3.0,5/15/2012,"Why do I have so much trouble pronouncing the name of this place?!  After always walking by and seeing how nice it looks from the outside, I decided to take everyone there for Mother's Day.I'll start with the negatives:.Where do they get off charging what they charge for the mixed liquor drinks when they are all ice and watered down?  The drinks were the biggest rip-off EVER.  Really I wanted to complain to them but didn't.Stick to the wine or beer only.  Next negative:  Vinegar - too much used.  I'll explain later.Service from our waiter, Billy was very good.   Pretty nice ambience, although much too loud with kids at brunch time.  Our meals varied.The warm eggplant app was good - served with greens, and much too small but tasty.The baba g.  had a very smoky flavor and was pretty good - again, too small a portion and too much oil poured over it (the oil took up half the plate).The lamb burger and sandwich were good.  Stick with the burger if you get this - the grilled lamb shank  served as a sandwich was strange- the roll tasted fried, as in deep fried but was mushy at the same time.  Served with mixed nuts on the side. ???  Yes, different.The star of the night of course was their signature b. sprouts dish.  Our first bowl was so delicious - with fig puree, walnuts, yogurt, mint... that we ordered a second sprouts dish.  Now I know consistency really varies at restaurants from one visit to another, but how can consistency vary so much from one hour til the next hour we ordered the same dish?!!   Second bowl came out hot - just made- but the chef must have been talking while he poured the vinegar, as the vinegar was wayy too overpowering and the overall flavor not at all the same/good.And the vinegar served on the lamb kebab was just terrible...My dad didn't even want to finish his dish but he did because he was starving, and the portion was just tiny.  I mean for the price of an entree - just tiny!The dessert was very different and very good.  I wanted the Candy Bar, but everyone else wanted the Ashta, and so we got that and I was pleasantly surprised.   This dessert was so different and rather delicous in a unique way with the orange blossom, clotted cream and crunchy straw-like shreds of phylo. Glad the meal ended well with the dessert since I had to hear my dad go on about the tiny portion and the overload of vinegar making him sick.  Being that we were here for lunch and I didn't even order my own meal or a drink - just 2 vegetable tapas style plates - I am just glad he wasn't the one paying the bill! (someone take out the smelling salts,,,please!!! I couldn't believe the total price)Dessert was the fave along with  the sprouts and their delicous hot baked pita - ask for 2 baskets- you'll need it to fill up.The drinks rip-off really ticked me off and overall this place really gets 3.5 stars.  Some items were very good, although such small portions and some items were not too good at all - especially at these high prices.  And so yet another one where I say - okay to try, but wouldn't return...",1,0,0,Alexandra C.,"New York, NY",854,2017,62

4.0,5/7/2012,"ilili has delicious delicious food and I would have given 5 stars if it wasn't for the excessive car sales waiters and waitresses! On both occasions I've been to ilili we've been suggested for order 3-5 dishes a person because they are meant to be shared. I don't know what kind of people come here with the stomach for 3-5 dishes because I shared 3 dishes with a guy friend and we were stuffed. My advice when eating at ilili is...DO NOT LISTEN TO WAITERS/WAITRESSES and you will have one of the best meals ever!We started with a ""hommus"" and ""baba ghannouj"" for the table. The hommus was just okay, I think I've had better store bought hommus, but I do really like the baba ghannouj (as they have it written). The meal comes with free pita that is piping hot and soft, perfect for dipping!To share, my friend and I got the sea bass special, the brussel sprouts and the bone marrow. The sea bass was buttery and flaky, but the tomatoes that came with it tasted a little funky. I think the way they are cooked leaves a strange after taste. The brussel sprouts are amazing! A little charred, a lot of flavor and the walnuts and grapes gives more texture to the dish. Yumyum. The bone marrow was fatty and large, but it was still kind gel-y ish and stuck to the bone. I've had bone marrow elsewhere and it was more solidified and easier to pull out of the bone. Still very indulgent though!The restaurant itself is very modern and hip, with a lot of mirrors and dim lighting. It's great for groups AND an intimate date. The atmosphere definitely easily accommodates for both.",0,0,1,Diana S.,"Manhattan, NY",290,448,282

Pretty big place with a nice bar/waiting area on the side. Bathrooms are modern with tiny neatly folded hand towels but it's unisex so each stall smells like there's urine all over the walls. The hostess, wait staff, and bussers were all really nice and helpful. We ordered a bunch of tapas plates to share family style. We had the pita and hommus, moussaka, duck shawarma, beef shawarma, lamb kebob, and black iron shrimp. The duck and lamb were a bit dry and the beef was mashed into a mush and tasted a bit sour?

What's so good about their bone marrow dish?? We all tried it and it was disgusting. We ended the meal with two desserts and one of them resembled a bird's nest and had some drizzled honey did nothing for us. It didn't taste like anything. All we tasted was the honey. The other dessert which had chocolate was much better. I don't know how people's minds get blown away with this place. The only thing that's worth noting is the decor and the lobster hummus.

5.0,4/25/2012,"I was absolutely blown away by this restaurant, and I am a pretty picky eater.  First off the decor makes you feel like you're in a 5 star restaurant.  The ceilings are high, the atmosphere is chic, and there's like this cool box design on the ceiling if I remember correctly.  Marvelous!  There's even a tip jar for the bathroom attendant, so it gives you an idea of how nice this place is.Food wise, this place was one of the best I've had in NYC.  There's a lot of crazy exotic Mediterranean dishes, a deviation from the usual gyro-souvlaki-hummus-falafel that you see at most Mediterranean places.  I came with a party of 6 and we got a lot of dishes.1) The beef dumplings turned out to be these really really tiny dumplings with some sauce.  The dumplings were probably like the size of a quarter, and I had hoped that these would be larger.  But they were still good.2) The brussel sprouts were AMAZING.  They were cooked slightly crispy and had amazing flavor.  I don't even like brussel sprouts that much but they cooked it very well here.3) The duck schwarma was yummy, but I can't remember what it tasted like.  It tasted better than my Chicken Shish Taouk!!4) The eggplant dish had very thinly sliced eggplant.  I'm not a huge fan of eggplant but my friend said it was quite possibly the best eggplant he has ever had.5) Chicken Shish Taouk was slightly disappointing - the chicken was so so and I was expecting more from the sauce but I didn't really taste anything.  The other dishes overshadowed this one by a mile.6) Lahmajeen (pita with lamb) was really really flavored well.  LOVED IT.  They came in these cone-shaped pita.  I would definitely get this if you like pita + meat.Also, the yogurt/cheese dish they leave on the table in the beginning is spectacular.  It kind of tastes like glorified cream cheese but it was so yummy.Total for 6 people came out to be around $180 with tax and tip.",2,0,1,Danielle C.,"Santa Clara, CA",584,2742,922

Everything was delicious though. The standouts were the fries, the beef kibbeh, the warm eggplant, and the lahmajeen. Wait, did I mention the fries? They are incredibly salty, but once you dip them in the garlicky mayonnaise concoction, it all comes together and becomes addictive. The eggplant was sliced thinly and cooked so that it wasn't the least bit slimy...in fact the texture became almost potato-like. The decor was stylish and our waiter was efficient.

The food is delicious, the service is pretty good, and overall, the experience was great.The hummus is tasty and doesn't taste like it came out of a plastic container. We tried it with ramps (similar to leeks) that came with fresh pita bread. Not your typical pita though, it was like a warm, soft pillow of goodness. The brussel sprouts are out of this world. Mixed with walnuts and grapes, I couldn't imagine a better concoction myself. It gets better though. The duck shawarma was so good it made me forget that Mamoun's even exists. The sweetness of the fig paired perfectly with the saltiness of the duck. Lots of reviews claim the duck was dry but um, it's shawarma, what do you expect? Finally, the chicken shish taouk was moist and on top of a garlic whip...so very good. all in all, service was good. i wasn't in a rush so i didn't mind that the waiter took a while to take our order. but he was knowledgeable and made some good recommendations. drinks are good too - what you would expect out of a cocktail. great find in flat iron. and if you take anything away from this review, make sure its ""get the duck shawarma.""",0,1,0,Alka J.,"Manhattan, NY",22,176,288

5.0,4/17/2012,"We started off our meal with drinks - one From Beirut with Passion and one Phoenician Lemonade. The Beirut has a distinctive herbal taste from the basil, cilantro and mint infused vodka. If you're more into sweet, fruity flavors, I'd highly recommend the Lemonade over the Beirut.Their complimentary labne is straight up amazing - I know it's just strained yogurt with olive oil, but it made us seriously consider ordering another round of labne off the menu. We decided to aim for variety though and got the mouhamara (highly recommended by our server) instead. The mouhamara is more chunky than creamy in texture and paired well with their warm, fluffy pita.Next came what I thought was the highlight of our meal - the warm eggplant mezza. I'm a huge fan of anything with tamarind in it and this dish was just a mouthwatering medley of savory flavors. Highly recommended.We also had the duck shawarma, which was served in two cones. I thought the duck was a little dry, but the fig puree and garlic whip really pulled everything together to make it one satisfying dish.The service overall was very attentive, but a bit pushy at times. We were strongly encouraged to order more dishes and drinks - it is a tapas-style joint, so many diners may feel that they have not eaten enough for their meal if they order only a few mezzas. Honestly though, we (two girls) were pretty full by the end of our meal - so just trust your gut (literally).",0,0,0,Anne K.,"Philadelphia, PA",479,423,104

Super-creative food.  Shake, stir, repeat.   This trendy spot delivers the goods in a festival of sensory delights, none greater than pastry chef Melissa Camachi's dessert du jour:  a chocolate-carob fudge cake made with Lebanese pilsner and decked out with Lebanese chocolate ice cream and whipped tahini cream, all draped in chocolate sauce.  Perhaps even better than it sounds.There were other distinct highlights from our meal, including Brussels sprouts with fig puree, red grapes and mint yogurt and okra tossed with candied orange rind.  One of the daily specials was a magnificent roasted cauliflower and hot red pepper tower with labneh.These magically Mediterranean mezza hit the spot especially when paired with beautiful, oven-hot cylinders of pita bread and delicious houmous and babaganoush.    Our companions ordered a whole fish bathed in a phenomenal array of ginger and citrus flavors.Our non-veggie dishes, chicken shish taouk and sauteed shrimp with jalapenos, were tasty but not as otherworldly as some of the other creative combos.The consistently friendly, down-to-earth, never intrusive service made our evening all the more delightful.  Though we lingered over our many courses and didn't hesitate to request more time in search of the perfect order, we never felt the least bit rushed...a novel concept in Manhattan dining.",1,1,1,Derek W.,"New York, NY",67,178,3
5.0,4/12/2012,"Ten of us went to ilili on Saturday for a birthday celebration.  We were promptly seated at a round table in the spacious dining area. We ordered family style and here's a review of the dishes I tasted.Labne - HIGHLY RECOMMEND: This delicious and creamy thick yogurt mix tastes great on its own with ilili's light and fluffy pita bread, or as a dip with any of the meat dishes. The yogurt is mixed with fresh mint and the Middle Eastern spice blend called Zaatar. Each serving is drizzled with olive oil.Kibbeh Nayeh Beirutieh - OK: This is an exotic name for steak tartar. The raw meat is served in the shape of a brick and is mixed with burghul wheat. Though it was tasty, I prefer a less dense consistency and I like the meat mixed with more fresh red onions and capers.Brussel Sprouts - MUST HAVE: This has got to be one of the restaurant's trademark dishes. It is exceptionally tasty. The brussel sprouts are mixed with a fig puree, grapes and mint yogurt. YUM!Chicken Livers - UNDECIDED: I had never had chicken liver and I found the taste a bit overpowering and the dish heavy in general, but my boyfriend who is a chicken liver fan loved it. Others must have loved it too because It didn't take long for the liver to disappear. Katayef & Veal Bacon - MUST HAVE: This was probably the best dish of the night. What the menu fails to translate is katayef which are mini Lebanese pancakes. Veal bacon served inside a mini pancake with a fig vinaigrette, pickles and hot cherry peppers. GENIUS!Fattoush - HIGHLY RECOMMEND: This is such a refreshing garden salad mixed with pita chips and a sumac lemon vinaigrette. Who knew sumac would taste so good with lemon dressing? Note to self to try it with my own salads.Mixed Kebab Plate: HIGHLY RECOMMEND: The plate includes juicy chicken shish taouk, lamb kebab, and kafta which is a blend of spiced ground beef and lamb.In addition to these delicious dishes, the service was top notch too.

Ilili is beautifully decorated, the lounge and bar area are separate from the dining areas, which I appreciated.

5.0,4/8/2012,"Excellent Lebanese food. I've never really had Lebanese but it's very similar to Turkish (they offer Turkish coffee). But ililli is getting a 5 star because nothing I had was bad and I tried a lot of the menu. Prices are high teens, low twenties..up to $28 for lobster.. typical NY prices. I came here for Easter Sunday family dinner with no reservation (surprising- they said they didn't need any..and it's true; we only had a 5 min wait for a party of 5). It also helps that the space is really big- with unique stall bathrooms, a beautiful lounge and lots of orange/red tables to keep with the warm Middle Eastern theme.Service- waiter was really nice, prompt, and made good recommendations. They could have been better about refilling the waters. But that's ok. This isn't an ""all about the service"" resto. The food was equally unique and it was delicious. We ordered a lot of different apps and entrees and we all shared everything (that came with deliciously hot pitas- with free refills.. and very thin and white- unlike other pitas I've had):1. The brussel sprouts- yummy sauteed sprouts with walnuts, grapes and cream- deliciously filling and a good mix of sweet and salty. Easily best thing we had all night 2. Eggplant dipped in oil..? Not sure what this was called but it wasn't babganoush..they were like eggplant chips. This was good- a tad salty. 3. Grilled octopus- grilled so perfectly. Not chewy, with good spices, and wonderful garnish of radishes. a plus.4. Cauliflower and sour cream- really good grilled cauliflower with sour cream and some kind of butter? 5. Wild Lebanese rice with butter, pistachios, and vermicelli- very unique and interesting Onto the mains we shared. We tried to keep it to the traditional stuff but there are a lot of Italian esque things here (semolina gnochi)6. Citrus trout- didn't taste a lot of citrus but it was very delicious- with crispy skin, and lots of yummy deboned fleshy fish. You get the whole fish here- for some $24? Not bad. Our waiter recommended this over the lobster hummus.7. The duck shwarma- not the most tender duck but that's the way it's prepared..it's not that crispy either. But it's juicy and flavorful..wrapped in 4 crepes to share. The crepes (shaped like cones) were very yummy. 8. The veal bacon sandwiches- forget the exact name of this. I didn't try it because I don't eat veal. Total food cost for 5: $150.

I don't know what was in that sauce, but whatever it was...yeah it was good. We shared hummus with what I suppose you could only describe as pillow soft pitas. Along with that we had lamb and beef meatballs in a cherry sauce and the beef schwarma or however you spell it. Everything tasted great. The schwarma was served with spices and stuff (I don't know what anything was called exactly) in a pita pocket type thing. I could have eaten 10 of those.

The highlite of the night were the fiddle-head ferns which were a special spring dish.  The lamb was spot on.  The hot foods were hot and cold were a nice room temp.  Have to give big props to the wait staff.

4.0,3/24/2012,"ilili is a fantastic Lebanese restaurant located in the Flatiron District. I've been there a few times now, and it never disappoints. My in-laws were in town Saturday afternoon, and we were originally going to go to Il Bastardo, since we're having an event there in May, and we wanted to show them the restaurant. I didn't get the memo, however, that Il Bastardo turns into a loud, DJ blasting, fist pumping, can't get a table at 2pm, 2-hour all you can drink, EXTRAVAGANZA/CLUB/LOLOL for brunch. This was not a place to take the in-laws, at least during daytime hours. We'd come back at night when things settled down.Since we needed a backup plan, we immediately though of ilili. When we arrived, it was a breath of fresh air, and had the maturity, sophistication, and calmness that our previous choice lacked. The best thing about ilili though, is that every time we have gone there, it's been the same vibe. It's consistently great. The decor is beautiful, and the restaurant is spacious and grand, with the large 2-story space divided into smaller areas. And so this is the perfect place for a romantic Saturday night date, or a place where you bring people from out-of-town, because of the sleek surroundings and versatility.The food at ilili, however, is what keeps us returning. Lebanese, along with Italian, French, Mexican, and Japanese, is widely thought of as one of the major ""best"" cuisines in the world. And ilili really makes Lebanese cuisine shine. The lamb burger is delicious. The hummus is a crowd pleaser and is served with warm freshly baked pitas inflated with air. The brussel sprouts with grapes and mint yogurt are always cooked perfectly and it's a great flavor combination. The warm eggplant is a standout, sliced into coins, busting with flavor, and had nice crispy skin. I'm a sucker for the rkaykat, which is phyllo dough filled with the nice salty kashkaval and feta cheeses. The tuna belly is lightly cooked, with fall off the bone texture, and served atop an avocado puree, and sprinkled with tiny berries and thin radish slices. I'm not one for sharing, but the best way to go at ilili is to share a bunch of mezze. For dessert, you HAVE to get the ""candy bar."" Delicious layers of chocolate, crispy bottom layers, and sprinkled with pistachio. With so many restaurants in the city, I try not to visit the same place twice, unless it's really delicious or special. However, I have been to ilili several times, and I am confident I'll keep returning.",0,0,0,Meghan A.,"New York, NY",235,593,533

5.0,3/10/2012,"Went to this place for the first time a year ago when a friend organized my birthday dinner here. Went for the second time this past week, and wondered why it took me this long to come back. Middle Eastern/Mediterranean with a heavy Lebanese influence, this place has great mezze and mains alike. Unless you are with a huge group, I would decide at the outset whether you are going to do a bunch of mezze (2-3 per person would be plenty) or a shared appetizer and a main. The portions and the food are hearty enough that you will end up disappointed that you can't finish all the food if you don't pick one or the other. They also have great ""sharing"" plates - large samplers of many of their appetizers if you happen to be with a large group. Being quite carnivorous myself, I often have difficulty choosing a place when dining with vegetarian friends unless it's Indian or Mexican or condemning my veggie friends to pasta and salad. I must remember this place the next time I'm in that situation! My veggie companion and I shared the Lebanese Thyme salad (perfectly and simply seasoned with lemon and olive oil, and of course, thyme), Falafel (just ok), thick-cut potato fries dusted with red pepper flakes and served with aioli (yum!), and Labne (thick yogurt and olive oil perfect for dipping with the warm pita). I ordered salmon roe on the side to accompany the Labne, which was a nice touch. And the carnivore in me couldn't resist ordering a meat dish - I forget the name, but on the place were 3 delicious little sandwiches with bread reminiscent of dosa, stuffed with lamb meat and soft thick bacon - heaven! The last time I came, I had a whole crispy fish served on a bed of kale and hummos. I loved it so much I though I would get it again this time, but got side-tracked with all the mezze :) Oh, and the Lebanese beer is worth a try, and the ambiance is sleek and trendy.",0,0,0,Angie W.,"New York, NY",4,18,0

Maybe not, since Lebanese food is hard to come by in NYC... frankly I have had better from Whole Foods.Anyway, atmosphere downstairs was fine, but I guess if you are over age 29 and not super-hip nor super-hot (neither of which I am any longer) you get shuffled to the upstairs area, which is atmospherically snooze-ville. Although the acoustics are a bit better than downstairs, I imagine, given the lower ceiling.Pros: We were seated on time. The waitstaff was fine, if not the usual. It was our guys' first night but he did ok. Not sure if it was truly his first night though, or the old trick waitstaff uses to excuse a screw-up (ie: forgotten drinks, or unusually delayed entrees.) But, whatev.Cons: Our dinner was plain, well... just plain. Nothing was worse than the lamb sausage I must say. Somewhat like over-microwaved meatballs. Nil on flavor. I almost cannot recall anything else we had because of the 6 or so mezze we ordered, nothing stood out to me.I would not say avoid this place at all costs, but darn, there are a lot more atmospheric and tasty spots to hunker down at in Flatiron than ilili.PS - Points though for the restaurant name being a palindrome.

I love the way this place is decorated, lots of wood, glass, rich linens and those cool hanging light bulbs.  Very nicely done, but as I've said before, I'm here for the food!  We got in a little early and the hostess was very pleasant and told us they were clearing a table and it would just be a moment. right after We got there there was a larger party in the lounge area that were obnoxiously pestering her about being seated. I don't believe they had a reservation and even if they did their party wasn't complete and unless this is your first time at a restaurant you know they generally don't seat you. My advice, don't be obnoxious with the hostess, do it to your late ass friends. LOL  The hostess was a pro and handled it with class. Once we were seated out waiter (Ryan, I think) was great. He welcomed us to Ilili and we chatted about how we'd dine that evening (Apps galore) and he answered some questions about the drinks. My GF got the Phoenicican lemonade  which was not too sweet, just perfect, kind of like a Mojito. For the life of me I can't remember the name of my drink but it did have a mixture of whiskey and arak that had a hint of liquorice and was nice and strong.  Now on to the food. In my ever changing review style I'm going to list what we had and what I thought (they're all apps and I was ordering with my eyes so no no judging! Capiche?)The pita they brought out first was delicious, nice and warm and fluffy. Arnabeet Mekle.  A roasted cauliflower that had a spicy cream sauce that wasn't to over powering. a little minty a little lemony and a little spicy. Such an awesome  combo of flavors that would prove to be the theme of this place. Tuna belly.  Sauteed I think and served with wonderful radishes and beets (my nemesis) and a light avocado puree. Perfectly balanced and the tuna was very fresh. Grilled Octopus.  I usually get this with only olive oil and S&P which I love. This was equally delicious.  Accented with cauliflower pine nuts and a hint of fennel. The octopus might have been steamed because it didn't have any char marks on it ,but delicious none the less.Duck Shawarma.  A duck ice cream cone for adults. Beautifully grilled duck and chicken with sweet fig, spicy garlic and green onion.  This one did not last long  on my plate. Bone Marrrow.  Roasted to perfection to bring out the natural juices and flavor. The little pita pockets were the vessels which would deliver the creaminess of the marrow, the tartness of the cherry tabbouleh and the slight sweetness of the labneh made this one of my faves.   Kafta.  This was my least favorite (It was not my pick ;) ) Nice sauce on the side but the texture of the beef mixture itself was not to my liking. And my absolute favorite was the Katayef and Veal Bacon. I didn't even know there was veal bacon. Why was it withheld from me for all these years?  The dish was so complex, the sweetness of the figs, the sour pickles, the hot peppers and the smokiness of the bacon all tucked away in a light and fluffy pancake. I could not get enough of this. Seriously, I'd burn down cities to get to this stuff. You need to order this when you go. I had a great time and wonderful flavor experience at Ilili.

If you like to experiment and you are not afraid to try different flavors and textures, I completely recommended, it is worth the try.",0,0,0,Carolina C.,"New York, NY",20,32,50

I really love middle eastern/mediterranean food, and I eat it often. I liked that even though this place is upscale and gourmet-ish, my meal still felt very authentic..  I did NOT enjoy the brussel sprouts that were *highly* recommended by my server, it was just a weird dish. I think the problem with it is that it's a hit or miss plate- everyone at my table raved about them. You love them or you hate them as far as I can tell.  The downside: The portions are MINISCULE.

We started with 4 appetizers and they are generous size. We got this sauteed shrimp, which is close to ASian flavor and is absolutely delicious. Their hummus is also creamy, rich and goes so smoothly with warm pita bread. The tuna tartar was fresh, tender and juicy. My entree was steal head trout with grains and vegetable. Surprisingly it tastes just like salmon except it is not as fatty and rich. However, it has the same tender and smooth consistency. The sauce was excellent and I love the crispy skin from the fish! MY husband got the lamb kabab and it was tender and the flavor was really good. We ended our dinner with their sweet desserts. I love the ""Candy Bar"", which is essentially Chocolate cake with crispy wafer and other mysterious ingredients. It is a must-order. The cheese cake was excellent too.

This place is ALWAYS packed and I've only gone on weekdays.Let's start with what went right:- black iron shrimp - my drink. I think it was called Strait from Beirut. Everything inside sounded like a mojito but it tasted nothing like it. It was sweet and delicious.- lebanese rice (UHH-MAZING). WARNING! They ask if you want rice (I thought it came with our meal but they actually charged us $8?)- DUCK SHAWARMA. oh man.

1.0,2/14/2012,"I never write reviews.  This is the first time I felt like I had to write a review, because I am so appalled by the treatment afforded by ILILI's  staff, that I felt compelled to let others know what happened to us. My boyfriend and I decided to have a romantic dinner a few days before Valentines - because he works during the week, and on Valentine's day I get out of my college course at a very late hour.  At my work place on Friday I asked around for a good place to eat - apparently my manager thought highly of the food at ILILI and suggested that I make it my first choice.  I overlooked the menu which seemed interesting, and appealing.  Right after I got out of work on Friday, I booked for 7 pm Sunday night.  My boyfriend and I were both excited and waiting to have our romantic dinner for two. We arrived at 7:00 pm at ILILI and were immediately seated in a poorly lit back part of the restaurant, next to an already existing party.  The tables were a little too close for comfort so we moved over our table slightly away from the existing party.  Meanwhile, the rest of that section of the restaurant was vastly empty.  About five minutes after we sat, while we ordered water (and sparkling water) another party was seated on the other side of our table.  So much for a romantic getaway for two.  The rest of the section of the restaurant (the side across from us even) was empty. Placing the seating aside, here started the real trouble.  Our waiter, Bryan (or Brian) seemed friendly and playful, but the way he carried himself came off a little rude.  We started to order, and as we ordered our second dish he immediately made an ""Oh no...."" kind of sound, suggesting that the food we ordered was not good.  He then joked and said ""Oh I just wanted to see your reaction, its good I'm just joking with you.""  My boyfriend was caught off guard and so was I, not understanding what he probably thought was a good joke.  We finished ordering, and the waiter Bryan then suggested that we try the brussel sprouts.  My boyfriend explained that as a kid he always hated brussel sprouts, and therefore did not want to try it.  The waiter then proclaimed how the restaurant's brussel sprouts were amazing, and that he wasn't being pushy but we should give them a chance.  Once more, my boyfriend explained that he did not want them, and that what we ordered was enough food.  As a last ditch effort, the waiter suggested that we drop an already existing item on our order, to make room for the brussel sprouts.  My boyfriend was trying to be as pleasant as possible in saying no, and finally got the water to take our order of five existing courses without the brussel sprouts.   Five minutes later when the table over was ordering, they happened to order the brussel sprouts.  The waiter jokingly said that we would be very envious, and that they made a good decision on what to eat.  As Bryan was talking, I was getting more and more mad at him - and less forgiving.   After we got our first set of food, and began eating, Bryan came over to ask how everything was - but instead of simply stating ""How is everything"", he said instead ""How are those brussel .... I mean how is everything, whoops well placed Freudian slip there!""  He was not funny.  At this point, my boyfriend knew that Bryan was ruining my meal.  He could tell something was wrong, and that my night was being ruined (which also made him feel bad).  All because this waiter would not give up the brussel sprouts!   After we finished our meal, we didn't even want desert.  Both of us just wanted to leave and unfortunately our ""Valentine's Day"" was ruined.   My boyfriend told Bryan ""I'm sorry, were all full, we'll just take the check"".  As a response, Bryan said to us ""That's okay, so what are we going to get next time?""  My boyfriend, thinking that he was talking about the desert said ""Well I guess next time maybe the candy bar?""  Bryan said ""No! The brussel sprouts!!!"".  We laughed it off, but inside we couldn't believe he just brought it up again. In all fairness, the food was pretty good and came in a timely fashion- the Phoenician fries and the duck kabobs were amazing. The atmosphere was cozy besides the fact that I think we were seated a little too close to others.  What really ruined the night was the service we had, provided by Bryan our waiter.  While he probably thought he was joking, he came off a little rude, unaccepting, and my boyfriend and I probably think he was mad at us because we did not try the brussel sprouts.  I get it, not every individual's personality mashes so well with others.  But in this case, it's as if Bryan needed to sell the item to every table - and he wanted to try to get us to order the brussel sprouts if it was the last thing he was going to do. My boyfriend and I will be hard-pressed to return to ILILI (unfortunately).  Please be sure to know that we will share this experience at ILILI with others, including family, friends, and business associates.",4,1,0,Jerry C.,"KNICKERBOCKER, NY",174,3,0
5.0,2/14/2012,"So I came in with skepticism because these high-end places usually end up with empty wallets and empty stomachs. High prices for small portions was exactly what I was thinking. And fusion mediterranean? Meh. But ilili - 1. Jenn - 0. I honestly don't even know what exactly we ordered. My aroused taste buds kind of left everything that night in a blur. :) I mean that in the most appropriate way too. We ordered family-style. I remember loving the duck shawarmas. I've had a lot of shwarmas in my lifetime but not with duck in it. It was perfectly cooked - tender, not chewy, and with a light drizzle of sweetness to it (similar to the Asian plum sauce). Their meat kabobs were tender and flavorful. Lamb wasn't gamey. And we ended it with an eggplant dish (with grapes). Pheonician fries .. wow. Grilled Octopus was full of flavor. First time I had Bone Marrow - very tender..melted in mouth. Decor is very classy but very comfortable/inviting. Lots of mirrors everywhere. Almost got lost. Bathrooms are pretty baller too.

4.0,2/11/2012,"Came with the girls for Winter Restaurant Week 2012.  I have to start by saying Illilli seems to be the best RW deal.  We got to choose 2 apps, an entree, dessert each & got a nice sample of the drink of the week.  For the 4 of us, we got to try quite a bit of the menu.We all agreed we would love to come back, so I guess Illilli understands RW and knows how to work it.  RW is marketing.   Ililli GETS RW, and does it right.  If they do RW Summer, make a reservation pronto.  I thought it was really fun to share lots of dishes, Lebanese tapas style.  Some dishes were excellent, some not, but that was ok.  It was FUN.  Of the apps, we made a serious dent in the 12 or so offerings.  -My hand-down favorite dish of the night was the cauliflower.  It had a little spice, to keep things lively.  The flavors were amazing, and all worked so well together.  -The hummus was the creamiest, fluffiest I have ever had.  I make my own hummus, and can't figure out what they do to make it so fluffy.  However, it was also bland.  The pita to sop it up was good, not great.  Tasted store bought, but still decent.  - the meatballs, which get rave reviews, were good.  The cherry and scallion sauce they come with is surprising, yet complementary.  It is a fun dish.- The herb salad was awesome.  Light, refreshing.  The dressing elevated to a whole new level.  We were all fighting over the last bite.  - falafel was bland, dry. Comes with a nice sauce to help you forget that.  - the rave-reviewed shrimp was not liked by anyone at our table.  We all had one, and left the rest uneaten.  It was too salty, and too much work to take off the shell.  - tuna belly with avocado was ok.  It was missing a certain something.  I thought the avocado fell asleep on the job and should have been supporting the fish a little more.- the red pepper and walnut paste was bland as can be.  I ate a ton of a very similar dish in Turkey a few months ago, and couldn't help but compare them.  Whereas the Turkish version is complex, spicy, rich, this one was bland and unimaginative.  Take care to select the entree very carefully.- the roasted lamb was way too bland.  - the braised beef was way too dry- the tilefish (for $5 extra) was incredible. The sauce was amazing, and the veggies supported the whole dish perfectly- the gnocchi was a hit with everyone.  Light, airy, fluffy pillows, with a yogurt sauce.  I recommend it, but recommend sharing it.  Too much of it would be too rich.  It was a little sour, and needed a supporting character with crunch (perhaps some sort of nut or vegetable).  Some herbs or shredded cucumber added to the sauce would also have hit a high note.  We all enjoyed it, but I don't think this dish would be for everyone. Ever have Fage Greek yogurt? It was sort of like impossibly fluffy gnocchi's drowned with a sour Fage.  The desserts can be skipped.  The candy bar, the ice cream, the cheesecake (more like a key lime pie) were forgettable and probably not worth the money or the calories.  The Lebanese clotted cream dessert was interesting and worth trying...it just didn't hit the spot after a yogurt based entree.The service was mixed.  The staff are all good looking.The hostess was incredibly rude.  My guests told me she had the nerve to tell them they had to be out of the table by 8:30pm.  Which we were, but who says that?  I have eaten at over one thousand restaurants, and have never had that said to me anywhere else.  The waiter, Mark, on the other hand was great. Attentive, patient, understanding, flirty...what else can you ask for?  He took his time to explain everything, and took his time to make recommendations.  He also assured us to take our time, and none was going to rush us out.  Props. I tried the Fresh Meadow drink with gin, and it was refreshing and delicious.  It was also really expensive...but that is the way it goes in Manhattan lately.  $15 for a drink is ridiculous, when I can buy the whole bottle of Hendricks, on sale, for the price of two drinks.  I subscribe to the theory that drinks should not be over $10.  But wait!  What is this?  Happy hour?  Hmmmm.  Seems my friends are smarter than me.  They ordered their drinks in the lounge and carried them to the table for half the price.  4:30-7:30pm, drinks are $7!  Woot!  I hang my head in shame for blowing our budget.  We purposely hit up RW to save money and try new places, and I blow it with a $15 drink.  The lounge is beautiful.  The downstairs dining room is beautiful.  High ceilings, woodwork, airy, vibrant, energetic. We were sequestered upstairs in the corporate lounge room.  White walls, low ceilings, no air, no decor, stuffy, cramped, boring, no energy- I couldn't WAIT to get out of there!  We were shoved in a corner, literally.  It is whole different restaurant upstairs.  They need to fix it up.  Avoid it at all costs.

2.0,2/5/2012,"Went there for restaurant week. I was impressed with the decor and service, but not the food. The appetizers were in generous portions . We tried eight different ones. I recommend the meatballs, sardines, salad, mouhamara and tuna belly. The chicken liver 's sauce was too sour, maybe too much pomegranate .  The crispy shrimp was not crispy enough , hence, couldn't really eat it with the shell as recommended by the waitress. As for the entrees, the lamb leg was too too dry . It seems to me they might have massively cooked a bunch of them and then reheated them as orders came in. The braised beef was decent. My friend's tile fish was fresh and the sauce was quite tasty.",2,0,0,Din L.,"Washington, DC",3,95,14
2.0,2/4/2012,"Loud... and not really what we expected. I thought we were going to a cozy, tastefully decorated Middle Eastern restaurant, but we stepped into a dressed down nightclub where all the hostesses and servers (I think even a few of the male servers) were wearing 6 inch heels and skirts so short, I had to wonder if I was expected to hand over dollar bills at every passing...The food was nothing special. My lamb leg, which the server boasted about, was dry and the accompanying sides didn't really add to the dish. The tile fish was moist, but the dish in its entirety was bland. Chicken liver was way too much liver for one's liking (unless you live on this stuff.) I think the best part of dinner was the warm pita bread that they served upon seating, but never refilled once devoured...Their signature cocktail - the Fresh Meadow - was another highlight... too easy to drink. I'd go back to the bar for a tall glass of that before having dinner elsewhere. Don't get me wrong, the dinner wasn't ""bad"", but there's so much better to be had out there.",2,0,0,Jason O.,"Woodside, NY",2,5,0

The gnocchi was definitely my favorite main course though.   My friend was nice enough to share.   I love the creative yogurt sauce, and the gnocchi was fluffly and melts in your mouth.  A+The cheese cake was mild- just the way I like it.   Not too heavy.  I would definitely recommend getting the ashta.  The cream had just a hint of salt, and the honey syrup around it was perfect.  I loved the Lebanese ice cream as well.  I got the pistachio, and it had a hint of rosemary.  The consistency was very surprising due to its foamy texture.   Service was great too!This is the way restaurant week should work.   They have made a loyal customer out of me, and I'm bringing friends.",0,0,0,Sharon L.,"San Francisco, CA",31,37,2
1.0,2/4/2012,"AT-I-TUDE! There are so many places to eat in NY where they are actually happy to have you and your money.  ilili isn't one of them... we didn't even stay to eat. We work literally right next door to ilili and finally decided to try it at 6:30 pm on a Friday night. Bar was hopping, decor looked great, only 2 tables seated in large main dining area. The Hostess with the Mostest Attitude  (read: ""I can barely suffer you Little People until my B-level modeling gigs start coming in"") asked if we had a res (""no""). Then she looked us up and down and said ""I can give you a table, but  you must be gone by 8 pm.""  Fine, i've heard it before at others places when I've walked in with no res - no problemo.  Another hostess then walked us past the main dining room and up the stairs into, as other reviewers said, ""Siberia"". Tiny, unattractive dining room upstairs. Only 3 tables seated there too - and she wanted to seat us Right Next to the other tables. We had private stuff to talk about, at least at first, so I requested another 2-top with some breathing room around  it. She said ""i have to check with the hostess and that means walking back downstairs."" So we all walked back downstairs. (HELLO - it's 2012, get a head set or walkie talkie!)  Hostess #1 didn't even hesitate with her quick ""No."" I asked if we could be seated in the main dining room since it was 90% empty, knowing we'd need to leave early, and she snickered and said increduously ""No!"" as if this was a crazy request from a plebe like me. Then she started to explain in a condescending tone what ""turning the table"" meant. Um, thank  you. I have a college degree and eat out more than you do, sweetheart. Reading other reviews it's clear that we're not the only ones to be treated this way. It's a shame because as I said we work right next door and would love to have made this a regular place for us (and, ahem, our money).  Instead we walked across the street to newcomer Lulu & Me and were greeted like old friends when we walked in the door.

4.0,1/30/2012,"This place, I really enjoyed.Came through here with a friend of mine for some Restaurant Week yummyness, and I was pleasantly surprised by the set up. Here's how they did it: first, you could order 2 appetizers per person instead of one, so by the time all our appetizers came out there was basically no room on the table for anything! But before that, they even let you sample the ""cocktail of the day"", for free, for Restaurant Week. The one we had was a Gin based cocktail, with cucumbers and some other stuff accenting it, it was quite yum.As far as the food goes, we got Hummus (of course), Falafel (also, of course), this sweet shrimp and then some lamb meatballs. Everything came out and looked great, and tasted great too. The falafel was on the side of perfect really, and they brough our stuff out with pita bread to wrap our yummy food in. The only thing out of the appetizers I wasn't a huge fan of was the shrimp. It was good, very flavorful, but you had to remove the shell, which was quite a hassle, to say the least. By the time you were done shelling it, you only had a little morsel of shrimp left! It would be nice if they brought it out with all the work done for me...I guess I'm just spoiled?For the main course we both got the chicken shish, which was alright but honestly I was expecting the food to have a lot more flavor, and also for there to be a lot more food! It was still good though. The desserts were good, but again, I'm not a big dessert person. I got the chocolate bar, which was, really chocolatey! My friend got the cheesecake, which was alright, but we were both expecting it to be a lot more than it was...i'm really enjoying my plethora of Restaurant Week conquests...on to the next one!",2,1,0,Clint H.,"Brooklyn, NY",341,479,54

Also, as soon as we sat down, our waitress bought us over a tasting of their featured cocktail of the week, which was not only a nice touch, but was fantastic tasting as well. We probably ordered close to everything on the menu, but besides the GNOCCHI, which I'm still dreaming of, the Arnabeet Mekle (I've never tasted anything like the sauce this was prepared in) and Moujadara were my favorites.

3.0,1/29/2012,"Came here with a group of girl friends for a birthday dinner. I had high expectations for this place because it's supposedly ""the best Lebanese/Mediterranean food you will ever have"". Went with the restaurant week menu so that we could have a taste of everything. Started with grilled sardines and tuna belly. Sardines way too salty, ease up on that sodium pre grilling. The tuna belly was okay, nothing else to say about. Flavorless, under seasoned (can I have some consistency here?).The lamb leg was way too salty! It was also incredibly dry and overcooked. I tasted no citrus or mint notes and if you're going to purposely point out that these flavors are going to be present in a dish, I expect to taste them. Had a gnocchi from another diner's plate. Gummy and really large gnocchi, I prefer mine to be bite size but even then I don't think the sizing of it would have saved the dish.  The milk ice cream was very light and refreshing. I actually prefer that chewy texture that I think is common is most Mediterranean ice creams. Tried the pistachio and definitely would have preferred the sweet and nutty flavors to come out more. Honestly, the only thing salvaging this review is the Brussels sprouts. Best I've ever had. Roasted with walnuts, the fig puree and grapes perfectly complemented one another and struck that fine balance between savory and sweet.

I ended up getting it but not everyone at the table did.The place is a lot bigger than you would think looking from the outside! It's pretty trendy and spacious and I liked the feel of it when we came for lunch. The layout is interesting as the restaurant seems to be separated into three long sections. When you walk in there's the bar, and then to the left there are sections for seating. We were seated when 4 out of the 6 people arrived which was nice.I got the Phoenician fries, lamb dip, and banana bread pudding. The fries and the lamb dip sandwich came out at the same time and they were sooo good! The fries had just the right amount of spices on them for their size and the dip complemented the flavor as well. The lamb dip sandwich was very nice and lamb-y but not overwhelmingly so. The dip was a bit salty but maybe I just dunked the sandwich in there too much haha. The bread it came on was really nice too! The outside crust was nice and crisp (not hard at all though) and the inside was just the right softness for a sandwich. The meal also came with a basket of pita bread for the table and since two people got dip like dishes for their side (whipped chankleesh and can't remember the other...) we were able to try some of that as well. I didn't have too much though since my meal was already incredibly filling. I remember the whipped chankleesh was nice though because it was pretty light and you could taste the olive oil in it, which was different, but still yummy. I also tried a bite of my friend's braised lamb shank, and I recall that it had more spices in it than my lamb dip - it seemed pretty good.The banana bread pudding was okay, a bit more cakey than I expected but not bad. It came with a side of chocolate....something (might've been slightly melted chocolate ice cream but didn't really seem like it) that was pretty good.Service was good and the waiter was able to give good suggestions when my friend ordered what to ask.

4.0,1/6/2012,"I am relatively new to Mediterranean food and I have little experience in the cuisine. I cannot say that this place is better or worse than other places, but it was an amazing dining experience for me. The food was amazingly good. I can comfortably recommend this restaurant to anyone who is uncomfortable with trying out new ethnic food. One downside is that this place is quite pricey and the portions are very small, which could make the bill jump quite high without really realizing it. All of the dishes are relatively low priced, but the portions are very small and you end up ordering more than what you originally planned and the final bill can be a surprise. Considering that for the same price, you could be dining at one of the more finer restaurants in the Michelin Star tier, this is a bummer. However, the food is excellent and the service is decent. I like the lighting and the interior. It is quite comfortable and warming with respect to the dim lighting and the reflection on the walls. From the appetizers, we ordered Hommus, Tabbouleh, Warm Eggplant with Pita bread and they were amazing. Warm eggplant in particular was outstanding. From the Meat section, we ordered the Chicken Shish Taouk, Kafta, Lamb Kebab, and they were all decent. The Chicken Shish Taouk was very bland and plain and I couldn't see why it has been so overly written among the Yelp reviews. Kafta was better in my opinion and Chicken Shish Taouk was an overhype. In general, I felt that this place has its forte in the meat section, so try to talk to the waiter/waitress for more details on the dishes. Everyone has mentioned Candy Bar as a must, but I feel that there is nothing Lebanese, or Mediterranean about the Candy Bar. It tastes like any chocolate infused desserts in any other restaurants or bakeries. A more ethnic and delightful experience in my humble opinion is Mixed Baklava, which is a traditional Lebanese pastry. It is excellent and more representative of Ilili. Candy Bar is a chocolate cake that simply cannot go wrong, but it's very American, rather than Mediterranean.All in all, dining at Ilili was a pleasant experience.

Our appetizer of falafel was excellent, crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside, and I would definitely order it again. For dinner, we split the Kebab Kerez which is lamb and beef meatballs with cherry sauce and Chicken Shish Taouk which is grilled chicken. At the last minute, we also added warm eggplant which had a tamarind molasses sauce. The meatballs were phenomenal. I'm not the biggest lamb fan but the meat combination was great and the sauce was delicious. On the other hand, the chicken was a disappointment. It was insanely smokey and definitely won't be on the ordering list next time. Luckily, the eggplant held up to the rest of the meal. I was so glad I ordered it at the last minute.

A place like this in the Detroit Metro area would make bank. Classy and trendy digs. Great drink creations (love the Lebanese Manhattan). And food that would make any Lebanese mother proud.The menus is split into tapas style offerings and more complete dinners. I think this is a great format for Lebanese food, as the cuisine has so much to offer. One can have only so much during a meal, but tapas affords for the opportunity to have a little of a lot (a major plus here as the quality and authenticity is nothing to frown at). If you are in Manhattan and want the authentic flavors of Beirut go to ilili.

All very good and very interesting.   For food, the b/f had the grilled shrimp and a rice dish...everyting was spiced and prepared wonderfully.   We split the Phonecian fries which were phenomenal, esp. with the garlic whip sauce.I had the lahmajeen (sp?) which was like a lamb flatbread pizza.  So delicious! Sweet and savory in perfect proportions.  I also had the tartar, which was served with raw onions, jalapenos and mint leaves.  It was astonishingly good.  I didn't know what to expect but I ate every bit of it.For dessert we had the Awaimat and the Candy Bar.  The Awaimat were like little beignets.  Delicious.  The candy bar was out of this world.  I loved it last time, but they said they made it better and they didn't lie.  It was excellent.The manager (I believe his name was Karim) came over a couple of times and he was very nice.   This is definitely on my list of favorite restaurants in NYC.  It may seem a bit pricey when you factor in drinks but in my opinion, it's worth it.  Do yourself a favor and try this place out.",2,1,1,Bill T.,"New York, NY",1361,2290,9300

I know I enjoyed eating my meal without having people entering and leaving the main restaurant during my meal. The best part of the restaurant was its classy decor and ambiance. The lighting and great crowds really made my dining experience oh so much more better.When we were led to our table, we (a pretty sizeable group of 10) were constantly doted on by our waiter. Not doted, more like nonstop jabber. He tended to our needs, but kept on suggesting foods that we clearly had no interest in. For the prices, the food is definitely overpriced, (or as our waiter said, the each mezza is the size of your fist and designed for sharing), but they all were amazing (if you're on a budget, aka, a student, dont come to the restaurant expecting to be filled by what you order). The lamb ribs had soft meat, the kafta was a bit salty but perfectly marinated. The rice was nicely fluffy and had a perfect amount of nuts. We were excited for the four orders of  chicken shish taouk because of the glowing yelp reviews. Most probably it just wasnt served and made well when we dined, because by the time it came to our table, it was cold, lost its flavor, and looked a bit unappetizing.

4.0,11/14/2011,"Brought my mom here when she visited, since we were in the neighborhood and I saw good reviews. Was not disappointed!We did the prix fixe, which got us two appetizers, an entree, and a dessert per person for $42. Some of the entrees were more expensive at $47. Still, perfectly reasonable. None of us drank, which I think saved a pretty penny; the drink menu looked delish, but good lord it was pricey, and the strawberry basil tea was just fine, thank you very much. Food was incredible. The mezze were larger than I anticipated, which is always a treat. I highly recommend the sweet corn and haloumi! The hummus was mega creamy, the cucumber/leek rolls were crispy and salty, the falafel had a mega crunch to it. Everything was just wonderful. As for our entrees, we got the two vegetarian choices, and one meat dish. The vegetarian risotto was creamy and mega cheesy. Definitely more stick-to-your-ribs than one might expect, but still phenomenal. I did not partake of mom's lamb kebob, but she said it was splendid (I stole a tomato off her plate, and it definitely had a nice smokiness to it). But in my opinion, my gnocchi entree stole the show. I remember someone once describing gnocchi (in general) as ""delicate little pillows"" or something, and I've always been annoyed with that description, since gnocchi, in my experience, is chewy and leaden. But now, I understand. I know what gnocchi is supposed to taste like. This was a puffy, dreamy little entree of lightly toasted gnocchi, with a savory whipped cream sauce that just made you feel lighter with each bite. So. Darn. Good.The decor is very nice, albeit a lot of mirrors and curtains, which can make it annoying to navigate. I swear, even after being told by my companions that it was easy to get lost coming out of the bathroom, I still got lost. Also, bathrooms were pretty messy. I think this place is more casual than it would like to be. Just because it says ""dressy"" up there, don't think you can't get away with jeans. Service was wonderful. All the servers were very friendly and helpful, and they were able to seat us even though we were 40 minutes early for our reservation.

Great shrimp salad with very delicious fruit on it - dried cherries and dates, avocado, yum. Nice room as well. Superb hummus with a good dash of olive oil, I like it with the pine nuts. Tasty falafel, good fries, good mujadara but, I'm giving the wrong idea - the menu goes far beyond the basics. I am though ordering the basics a lot because I eat fish but not meat, so, a lot of my options are these sort of veggie basics.There are some minor complaints. The iced tea is good, but the serving is like 3 oz. in the tiny glass with ice. The tuna belly in the appetizer was so so, but the dish was so nicely prepared, I'm sure I'll be giving it another chance. The farro risotto was not 100% convincing, though it was interesting. A halavah based desert in dome shape was not that great. I had some Lebanese wine there that wasn't so good. The arak liquor was fun and tasty though. Had one cocktail in the many times I was there, and it was quite good, some tequila based thing with pomegranite. The coffee was good. Service always good there.

Simply Brussels great dipping! My fav appetizer was Brussels sprouts since we were ordering lots of meat in the beginning, the waitress recommended this dish THANK GOD i got to taste this fantastic & yum plate!!!  the fig jelly on top adding sweetness on the place, what a creation!i could have tried kebab or lamb but for some reason, i felt like bone marrow that night (fatty! but yum!!!) My friend had chicken shish taouk for an entree , i had a piece which was juicy ! bartender was nice also all waiters/waitress sound like they know what they are talking about .

He was so genius in pairing the labne with the lamb shank - I couldn't sing enough praises.The lamb shank was delicious on it's own but the labne (strained yogurt w/ olive oil) adds a creamy texture and takes away some of the gaminess of the lamb.

4.0,10/1/2011,"Healthy middle eastern food is always a hearty option. Ilili, one of the most trendy restaurants in its own category, produces deliciousness and creativity, which makes the whole dining experience as an art. High ceiling, mirrors all around... these are all catered to my taste. However, even though it's a bling bling kind of place, it's not pretentious at all.  I have a mixed feeling towards this. You will see what I mean, when you go into the restaurants and check out the people around. :) Anyway, what I really want to imply is that you'd feel completely relaxed and comfortable while enjoying a classy atmosphere there.Service is the best part. Our waitress is so sweet and knowledgeable.

4.0,9/30/2011,"Let me just begin by saying this is not generally my type of restaurant - the high ceilings are severe and unwelcoming, as is the pulsating Middle Eastern house music that makes it feel like a club, and I don't even know how to describe the neighborhood it's in. Is it the ""Brown District"" on those taxi cab maps? Flatiron Korea? Kipstown? MoSo (hip abbreviation for the neighborhood that houses the Museum of Sex)? I don't know.  But somewhere along the way, I bookmarked it as being ""good"" and went with my instincts when asked to find a restaurant in the area for FML (hip abbreviation for food with mother-in-law). On to the food. It's been said (by someone fabulous/crazy for sure), that brussels sprouts are the best part of Christmas - but I always thought this was some tongue-in-cheek joke. Not the case, now I know.  Have you ever eaten something so delicious and interesting and magical and succulent that you can't stop thinking about it days later? And you wake up in the middle of the night drenched in sweat, wishing someone would be waiting by your bed with a gigantic plateful of that food? That's how I feel about ilili's brussels sprouts. Gently braised and served with walnuts, fig puree, grapes, and a mint yogurt, they are at once tender, crunchy, sweet, and slightly bitter. Surprisingly delicious. And dare I say, maybe even good for you? Nah, probably not, but still... We also had the hommus (this is how they spell it!) with jalapeno ($8), which was delicately lemony and smooth; the Mouhamara (walnuts, sun-dried peppers, pomegranate molasses - $10), really interesting, kind of like a heavier tapenade, just the right amount of salty and sweet; the tuna belly ($15), four pieces, served with avocado, barberry chutney, radish, and beet; the bone marrow ($15), I've had better, but I liked the sesame pita pillows with which it was served and there was a LOT of it - so if you like copious amounts of fat dribbling down your face, and aren't in a situation in which you are trying to impress a date (my husband was literally gnawing at the bone by the end of the meal ), go ahead, order away; and the Katayef & Veal Bacon ($13), 4 pieces served like little tacos and absolutely outstanding. Solid wine list - they have one of my favorite wines by the glass: the La Cana Albarino (though it was $12/glass, which is kind of high considering the glass was quite small. ..I know, white people problems). Overall, despite the cavernous space and the bumping music, I think this is a great place for repeat visits. It is terrific for groups and though they have entrees, it really works best if you just order up a bunch of mezza dishes, take part in the complimentary pillowy hot pita, and share food all around.  The staff is super friendly and helpful and the menu is full of things I want to try (Grilled Sardines with fennel salt!) and those I want to have again and again (BRUSSELS SPROUTS!).  Oh, the unisex bathroom is really cool. But I will refrain from waxing poetic about it (only the brussels sprouts deserve that kind of attention).",1,2,1,merisa t.,"La Jolla, CA",77,209,2

Sweet creme for dessert with the fruit topping, one of the best desserts I've had. Average-poor service. I guess they tried to rush us?

4.0,9/25/2011,"Often times, we try to find one or two things we like about a restaurant. We focus on those as reasons to dine in or recommend to others. Other times, you'll be lucky enough stumble upon an establishment where there is nothing NOT to like. You find every reason to recommend it and visit them over and over again. Ilili is one of those places.It is an ideal spot to enjoy delicious Lebanese food, strong cocktails, great service, and terrific ambiance. Better yet, none of these are mutually exclusive. With a cavernous interior that has a bi-level space which separates itself into lounges and dining areas, Ilili works wonderfully for group dinners and celebrations as well as intimate dinner dates for two. Coming in for just a drink or two at the bar is just as fun with friendly bartenders and strong cocktails.Speaking of cocktails, lovers of fruit-fruit flavors and hard-hitting drinks seem to enjoy From Beirut with Passion with mint infused vodka and passion fruit. If one desires to balance a strong drink with a lighter, refreshing choice, the Fresh Medow (with gin and cucumber) is perfect. The food menu boasts a combination of typical Lebanese fare along with some novel creations. The memorable, yet typical, include Hommus (pine nuts), Warm Eggplant, and Bone Marrow. The amazing Saffron Tripe is the winner for creativity. Even tripe haters will be converted by this dish.Two drinking-and-dining experiences at Ilili only fuel the desire to come back for more. A glutton like myself will prefer to share more food with less people, but Laura A's awesome review (yelp.com/biz/ilili-new-y…) best encapsulates the group experience.

4.0,9/18/2011,"One of my clients is vegetarian, but he leads a group of meat eaters. So, it's important to find a place with a good mix of vegetarian and meat offerings when going out to dinner with his team. Alta was a big hit with this group, so the pressure was on to find a place that would rival it.Luckily, I happened to stumble across ilili during my restaurant search. The entire menu sounds really incredible, so we asked our very friendly waiter to bring over a small plate sampling of his choosing. We ended up sampling about ten different plates over the course of the evening, and they were all great. Highlights included the katayef and veal bacon, the sweet corn and cheese, and the ""AAAA"" asparagus. For dessert, we all shared an order of the excellent mouhalabieh.The interior is extremely unique and beautiful -- I love the geometric scheme and the wood tones. Beware, though, as walking back to the bathroom can be a little hazardous. Some of the panes are mirrors, and others are empty, so the ""fun house"" feel can be a little disorienting if you're not paying complete attention.Overall, ilili was a huge hit and an excellent choice for large groups with a mixture of tastes.

5.0,9/8/2011,"I hated lamb.  Through the limited time I was served lamb, it was either seasoned poorly or cooked so well-done that the""gamey"" taste lingered on.  I guess since ""gamey"" lamb was what I experienced, this soured my impression on this delightful meat permanently. Notice I said ""hated"" with a D in the end. Yes, past tense, people. Whoa, didn't expect a grammar lesson now huh?  I'm a believer for second chances and Ililli (I swear, typing this name makes me triple check on the spelling), renewed my faith of lamb. Who's a born again Lamb-eater? Me, that's who. Whoa, am I preaching now?It's true. You will never see me ordering lamb. EVER.  But when I attended the dishcrawl event and tried a sample of their lamb ribs with heirloom tomatoes, I fell in love. Such a tease, with it's well seasoned fall off the bone, non-""gamey"", melts in your mouth, succulent, soft texture meat, with no strong after taste.  Yes, exactly.  Enticing flavors kept me wanting more.Our group of 4 ordered mainly appetizers to share amongst the group. We like ""tapa"" style/ family style sharing and the dishes do a good job. It's a good way to experience different dishes and what they offer.  Our waitress was awesome and gave us recommendations on what dishes were popular and those that were good for sharing.  We sampled about  8 mezzas (appetizers) and one main entree to share and we were beyond full.  Don't underestimate the appetizers because the sauces used are a bit heavy.Some dishes that stood out were:a) Black iron shrimp : well flavored with jalapeno, garlic and cilantro. It was juicy, spicy, and the sauce was a good dip for the pitas.b) tuna belly: AWESOME dish. Think Pork buns style but replace pork with tuna.  The tuna belly seriously melted in my mouth.c) duck shawrma: came out in a cone and resembled a crepe.  Mixed with duck and chicken over a grilled pita bread, this dish was really good. Not only was the duck juicy and well seasoned, the sauces of fig puree and garlic whip gave that combination of sweet and savory. d) lamb ribs:  the bigger portion of what I experienced as a sample in Dishcrawl.  Whatever I said earlier from my experiences at dishcrawl, magnify by 10.  Even though we shared the dish, I secretly wanted it all to myself. What has gotten over me? Me, fighting over lamb? So yes, this isn't your typical Mediterranean food cart. This is Mediterranean food,""suited-up.""  Flavors will entice you, ingredients are fresh, lamb is amazing.  Decor? Initially confusing with all the mirrors-felt like  I was in a mirror house but it grew one me. This place is definitely a place to bring a date or to impress some friends.The price isn't as bad for the quality of food we experience. With about 10 dishes and a pitcher of sangria, bill came up to be split 55 a person.  Not bad for a fully satisfying meal with good ambiance.For now, Ilili is my standard for lamb.

One of them actually ludicrously claimed that we couldn't order too much food, which, um, we did and we couldn't finish it all. Their custom cocktails were ok - not worth $14 each and not exactly as described, but for $7 during happy hour would be worth it. For the 3 of us, the bill with tip was $220.

The food itself, while pricey (be ready to pay up) is amazing. Some of the best falafel I've ever had in the city. Hummus was very fresh and the mixed grill plate had the meats marinated and cooked to perfectoin. The service is a bit slow. Between our appetizers and our entrees there was a 25 minute gap at least. It wasn't really that busy either. This is the only reason I'm not giving the place 5 stars.Ambiance was definetly a plus here.Overall, if you're looking for really really good Middle Eastern cuisine and you're fine with splurging a little bit, I would definetly check this spot out.",0,0,0,Mohammed K.,"Manhattan, NY",4,9,0

3.0,8/24/2011,"This place is definitely pricey so just be sure you're up to it before hand. Dinner for two- easily 150 bucks after tax/tip without drinks.The food is really good and gets 5 stars in my book. On the other hand, I don't know why they rave about their brussel sprouts- in the end they are still just brussel sprouts. I wish I had ordered a different appetizer. Portions are also small.The kebabs are definitely delicious. They aren't your average run of the mill kebabs. There is certainly some additional effort being put into the flavoring, spices, and cooking. Are they worth 30 bucks? I'm not sure, but I probably won't be coming back. They aren't that much better that it justifies costing 3x as much. Then again, the food ins't the only reason people are coming here. Half of your money is going towards the nice decor and elaborate setup plus being able to tell other people that you ate here, so before we forget, let me tell you that I ate here before you.My guess is that 99% of the time the seating is great. The time I went there I got seated next to the kitchen door... a very busy kitchen door at that.The lighting is a bit too dim in certain areas. I have normal eyesight and I don't wear glasses, but it was difficult to even see the details of the food I was eating. A coke costs more than 3 dollars and since it's so dim the waitress can't even tell when you've finished it so she doesn't bring you another one. Our waters also didn't get refilled, probably for that same reason. They take reservations through open table and I liked that they pay attention to additional requests that you make online, eg booth seating or embarrassing someone for a birthday.The staff is very friendly and helpful. The service is also really fast. From start to finish we were there probably less than an hour. Overall, this place is great, I just don't think it's worth the money. Cut the price in half and it might be nice for a romantic evening or celebration of some sort.",1,1,1,Rizwan A.,"Philadelphia, PA",81,199,32
2.0,8/23/2011,"I'm pretty torn. The food was excellent, and my friends and I had a great time. However, the great time has little to do with the restaurant as we received such poor service.Five stars for the food. Absolutely.Five stars for Mark, who killed the COCKROACHES that were at our table. Yes, that is plural.A few other low points: 1) Our waitress, who overall was not attentive and generally pretty rude, lied to us about the cost of a ""comparably priced"" white bottle of wine, which was actually $13 more than we wanted to spend. 2) Although we had alerted our waitress days before and on the same day that one of our friends had a gluten allergy, we did not receive the dish without bread. Thus, the waitress offered to do the dish over without bread [as it was her/the restaurant's fault], but we were still charged $30 extra. This move alone is absolutely infuriating. 3) We confirmed twice that we did NOT order risotto, yet the risotto still made it to our table. (Luckily, this was taken off our bill, but come on! Listen to your customers!)4) Overall, we were lied to about the heaviness and amount of food we had ordered. Our waitress told us to order two extra entrees that we ultimately did not need, by far.5) Umm, yeah, and the cockroaches. Three of them. We noticed them as we were ending our meal, and Mark came to the rescue, even though he was not working our table. (Our waitress was nowhere to be found.) Because of the cockroach, we got free shots and one of our wine bottles was taken off our bill, but I think given that this restaurant has such a high reputation, this compensation does not cover the disappointing experience we had here. Taken all together, I have no other choice but not to recommend this restaurant.",13,3,4,Jess L.,"Sacramento, CA",3333,4439,3596

The whole atmosphere was very swanky, and I hesitate to label places as very ""New York,"" but this place was very New York. Especially the bathroom. Do check out the bathroom.Our server (Megan) was so friendly and attentive and brought us a tasting of sauvignon blanc. We immediately picked our 4 appetizers from the Restaurant Week menu. Warm, fluffy pita bread was brought out, which we tried to dip in all our apps: the mouhamara (walnuts/pepper paste), sweet corn and cheese (served in a skillet), and octopus. The lebanese thyme salad, our rourth pick, was very fresh and light.One thing that really impressed me was that although we premedatedly  saved a piece of pita bread for our dinner, Megan brought us more fresh, hot pita bread without us asking! We enjoyed it with our entrees of the farro rissoto and the gnocchi. I never knew Mediterranean could do pasta so well.The guy who brought out our dessert was really friendly also, making jokes as he poured the chocolate sauce over the ilili candy bar, which was chocolaty and rich, and definitely 1 portion, as it was difficult to share. Of course, we also shared our second dessert, which was a lebanese custard. It had a thick orange sauce on it, and against the liquidy custard, it looked like an egg sunny side up! It was a really playful take on a dessert, though Megan wasn't sure if it was supposed to resemble an egg.

5.0,7/21/2011,"I don't think I've ever given a restaurant a 5-star review, unless it has some sort of sentimental value.  Ilili deserves all 5 of those stars, without any sentimental value.  This review is also proof that Restaurant Week can stack up to going any other time of the year.After pouring through RW menus, I saw that Ilili's was full of veggies and fell in love.  I am not a vegetarian, but I'm close enough, and I am also picky to the max and allergic to dairy so pleasing me on a limited menu isn't exactly the easiest thing to do.I made reservations for after work with a friend.  It was still pretty mellow when we arrived, but I loved the ambiance -- perfect for a cocktail and a few small plates after work.  The bar/lounge and dining room were separated, but they still flowed together nicely.  Everything was clean cut and just pristine looking.We sat down and were greeted promptly.  Our server was nice, but not super friendly.  I would not say it was 5 star service, but it was not bad service by any means and the food certainly didn't leave me wanting anything more.They were pushing Paumonauk Savignon Blanc (from one of the LI wineries) for RW and gave us a sampling.  It was actually very, very good (and I usually prefer Pinot Grigio because I always know what it is going to taste like and try not to stray too far on wines), so I ordered a glass after finding out that happy hour (5:30-7:30) was only at the bar.Ilili's menu let's you choose two small plates, a main dish and dessert.  The small plates are actually quite big.We split:Hommus: This was actually my first hummus experience.  I've been avoiding it for picky reasons that I cannot even explain, but I enjoyed it.  Upon first taste, it didn't have much flavor, but there was a nice sweetness to it after.  We were given a ton of big, air-bubbled pita bread, which was fantastic -- both with the hommus and alone.  We had to ask for extra.  I love carbs and that is the understatement of a lifetime.Lebanese Thyme Salad: Probably my least favorite of the four because it was overwhelming with flavor and didn't complement the rest of the plates as well as the other three.  Regardless, it was still very good.Zucchini and Leek Bil Zeit: I LOVE zucchini and do not see it on menus nearly as much as I'd like.  My dad has a fantastic zucchini recipe (note: ask him for this immediately).  Anyway, the zucchini was cooked perfectly and filled with the right amount of flavor and hint of lime.  I'm not even a huge lime fan and I still loved it.Green Beans: By far the best plate.  Whatever they were cooked in was genius.  I could've eaten the entire plate myself, except my friend ordered it, so I had to act like he ate more (when really I think I did).For dinner, my friend got the duck leg and I got the chicken, which was cooked perfectly; though it was plain, it was still flavorful.  They gave me more pita (score! though not the puffy kind) and a small green salad with it.  I suppose the choice of two plates at the beginning makes up for the lack of sides, which I am okay with.  He loved the duck and I, of course, did not try it, so I'll go with his opinion.I went with the Ilili Candy Bar for dessert because it sounded too good to pass up, even if there was the chance of me breaking out in a rash.  By that point, I was pretty full anyway, so I knew I could have just a few bites and be satisfied.  It was the tiniest dessert ever, but extremely rich in flavor.  Chocolate lovers would swoon.  Stuck to my few bites and it was perfect.Will absolutely be back for dinner and drinks.  Their happy hour menu looked tempting and the food is definitely worth another trip.",3,0,4,Annie K.,"Boston, MA",99,385,12
4.0,7/21/2011,"Went to Ilili last night for restaurant week. I must say that I was very impressed with everything at this restaurant. From the atmosphere, to the service, to the food it was overall a very good experience. For the appetizer, we got the hummus, the Lebanese thyme salad, the warm eggplant and the sweet corn and cheese. Everything was delicious. The salad was good, but nothing special. I don't even like eggplant but when you combine the eggplant and sweet corn and cheese...it was amazing. And the hummus was fresh and really, really good. The main dishes were the duck leg and the crispy poussain. Both were very good. The crispy poussain was really like a chicken wing, but one of the best you have ever tasted. For a main dish, I would not have been thrilled to pay over $20 for this dish, but it still was very good. I actually preferred the duck. The sauce and everything about it was so good. The desserts were nothing special. I am actually allergic to nuts and told the waitress that. Unfortunately that did not get told to the chef because both the ice cream and the candy bar came with nuts on it and they were not willing to do it without nuts. If the dessert was better and more accommodating, this place would definitely deserve 5 stars. That was my only complaint. But the service was good and the cocktails very, very tasty (but expensive). If I'm spending $14 on a cocktail, it better taste like it. And this did for sure. I would come back. For $125, it was a very good meal for 2 people.",0,0,0,J K.,"New York, NY",1,49,0
4.0,7/21/2011,"SUMMER RESTAURANT WEEK 2011 REVIEW Came here last night for dinner very last minute and it might have been one of the best decision I've ever made!! First, the space is absolutely beautiful and its huge! Clean cut, simple lines and modern. I love how when you first walk in it's set up like a lounge area and then you see the bar. I figured the lounge area was just to have cocktails but I saw people having their meals there. Not sure I would enjoy that maybe just some apps though. I was seated right away and taken to a table in the back room. I was presented with a menu and then a few minutes later the waiter came over with a compliment taste of wine, one that they are currently promoting. It was a little too dry for my liking. To start the meal I got the falafel and the Mouhamara (walnuts, sundried peppers, pomegranate molasses). I almost went with the warm eggplant, as I read in numerous other reviews how delicious it was. But because I was getting eggplant with my dinner I decided to try something new. I was so happy I went with the mouhamara, it was out of this world. This was the first time I had ever had this and while it sounds like an odd combo of flavors, they were aligned perfectly. Topping a piece of falafel with the mouhamara was also a brilliant move on my part. I was also served a basket of three pitas but were heated and blown up in you will. So not only were they fresh out of the oven but they were a little crispy as well. It was great to dip with but to also make myself a little falafel sandwich. This also might have been some of the best falafel I've had in the city thus far. It was just so flavorful and moist in the middle but more importantly bursting with flavor! Entree: Fried Skate: eggplant mousahka, tahini, endive, salmon roe. So I wasn't thrilled when I saw that the one piece of fish I wanted was fried. I asked if it was flash fried and the waiter told me it was. I wouldn't exactly say it flash fried but it was deep fried either ... regardless I still ate it. The eggplant mousahka was so flavorful and when you got a bite of a little bit of everything, my taste buds were dancing! Dessert: ilili Candy Bar: chocolate kataifi crunch / chocolate ganache pistachio and fig caramel / table side, finish w/ warm chocolate sauce. Let me just start by saying, if you don't get this dessert when you come to this restaurant, your loss. This was soooo good and I totally wasn't expecting it be prepared the way it was. When they deliver the plate to your table there is a little bowl of warm chocolate sauce that they drizzle on top. While I had the image of a candy bar in my head it was similar to a brownie shape but most certainly not in texture. If I had to compare it to something, I would say it was more like a rice crispy treat texture but all chocolate if that makes sense. You could really taste the pistachios in which I enjoyed. On the side, the fig carmel sauce wasn't too rich which was great because I'm not a huge fan of carmel but it accented the dessert nicely. Again, if you don't get this ... your loss. The presentation of all the dishes was great and creative which I really enjoy, I think that's a huge part of the meal. The service was extremely attentive. I also feel as though they had too many waiters/waitresses and busboys in the same area, it got a little hectic at times. One thing I really didn't enjoy was how quickly the food came out. Within a minute of finishing my apps, my entree was at my table. I didn't even really have time to let myself enjoy the food I just ate and let all the flavors settle in, never mind let my food settle! I noticed the table next to me, and since there was two of them they were able to get two apps and their entrees came out and they weren't even half way through their apps, leaving no table space for their food and then their food was bound to get a little cold. I'm not sure if they were trying to rush people out because they were going to be busy or what but I didn't enjoy that. I had a reservation at 6 pm and was finished by like 7:10 and when I was leaving it was much busier and people were lined up at the hostess counter. Overall a great experience and delicious food. I'm not one to hit a restaurant in NYC twice but I could see myself coming back here. They also run a pre fixe lunch and maybe dinner menu making it a little more affordable.",2,1,1,Lauren L.,"Astoria, NY",414,331,602

2.0,6/4/2011,"I beg to differ with these reviews. The food was ok, but nothing great & management is incompetent.I brought my girlfriend and her mother here for her birthday (which I listed in the Open Table request box), mainly because the reviews are universally favorable...I now regret that.  Ok, I went strictly by the reviews on ordering the first round:- Brussel sprouts- Warm eggplant- Sweet corn with cheese- Bone marrowThese were ok, but I don't get the over-the-top reviews.So my girlfriend goes to the ladies room during the first course.  A busboy then taps me on the shoulder to move out of the way, because a baby carriage was coming in. I don't mean a low key one, I mean one of those gigantic baby carriages with all the features (bumpers, moon roof, antilock brakes, airbags, cup holders...you get the idea).Now, there are only two adults seated at this table for eight.  Our waitress sees this and comes over to check in.  My girlfriend had returned and, despite the fact that there is the baby carriage over her shoulder, says it's ok, which I relay to the waitress.  I then ask her how many people are in the party.  She tells me seven.  Now, as other reviewers have noted, this place is all about rules...""including no party is seated until all are there"".  Well, they broke this rule, as the rest didn't show for at least 15 minutes or so.  So, you may want to push them on this rule...although if you're not Lebanese (apparently), you may get no play.The rest of the party ends up seated, with one chair so close the guy might as well have been in my lap.  I would have to get up to let my girlfriend out again, much less breath.I see the ""Manager"" and call him over, explaining that it's a bit ridiculous to have the baby tank in the dining room and some guy over my back like it's a beer garden.   The manager then reveals he's a bit of a dimwit...not understanding the clear problem.  I tell him: ""its' my girlfriend's birthday and we jammed with a baby carriage and another diner"".  ""Sir, it's not legal for me to refuse service to those with children"" is the response.  Um, I'm pretty certain that a restaurant isn't required to have baby tanks in the dining room, much less that it's prudent in NYC where folks are paying top dollar for an enjoyable experience (forget the stupidity of the folks doing this). Stammering, he didn't really get the problem. I then suggest that this place isn't Chuck E. Cheese or McDonalds, to which he didn't' have a defense. I was exasperated and ready to pay the check and leave.  He finally came to the resolution - ""we needed to move to another table"".Ok, we move.  The waitress comes over, apologizing for the inconvenience.  We order more drinks and I am explicit in what we want, but I tell her I'm not in the right state of mind to order our second course. 15 minutes later, we call her over to inquire about the drinks.  Inexplicably, she hadn't ordered them. 10 minutes later we had them.  We ordered more food.  Everyone raves about the Phoenician fries.  THEY ARE FRENCH FRIES!  (with seasoning).  We like French fries...so they were good, just as they are at a myriad of other restaurants.  ""The lamb chops are so good""...yes, so are mine & I make them all the time.Then comes dessert - my girlfriend orders baklava.  It comes with a candle.I get the bill.  They couldn't even buy us the damned baklava.  Management here is not only stupid, it's cheap. I strongly suggest you take heed of the other reviewers who recommend getting a table upstairs where it is less noisy (and where they can't get a baby tank)....or, you may just want to save a boatload of cash and go to Chuck E. Cheese.Needless to say,  I expected a good time and got the shaft.I will never return to this place.  You enjoy those Brussel sprouts!",9,1,0,Big Easy K.,"New York, NY",6,91,34

4.0,6/1/2011,"Would you take your dad to a restaurant that blasts only the finest in Top 40 hits (that Barbra Streisand song) and has a clientele that resembles Pascha circa 1998?  Cut me some slack.  It was Dad's idea to come to ilili.Despite some of the less redeeming qualities of the ambiance and atmosphere, the food is surprisingly good.  My Lebanese friends would say the food is traditional Lebanese.  My Greek friends will say that the menu features many dishes their grandmother would make.  And my Turkish friends would vehemently disagree, saying that the Greeks steal everything from the Turks.  In order to appease everyone, let's agree that the food is traditional Mediterranean?Because we were in the mood to share and to try many different items from the menu, we ordered the Mezze Royale.  This particular spread includes 5 cold mezze and 5 hot mezze.  Our waiter suggested ordering an entree in addition to the Mezze Royale in order to make sure we were satiated.  Umm, okay.  Granted we were the heaviest folks in the restaurant, we were definitely full after the round of cold mezze.From the selection of cold mezze, my favorites were the Baba Gahannouj (it was much spicier than the simple hommus also served) and the Tabbouleh (the combination of mint and parsley was delightful).  The grape leaves were also executed perfectly and did not disappoint.We were granted a few minutes to allow our stomachs to meditate on the wonderful first round and out came the hot mezze.  After cracking a joke about whether the recipe for Phoenician fries was written in cuneiform (yeah, I descend from a long line of nerds), we dug in.  In addition to the perfectly spiced Phoenician fries, I also loved the mekanek (delightfully spiced lamb sausage) and falafel.  I didn't think it could get better than my East Village student staple falafel, but it does.  The perfectly crisp exterior, the delicious yogurt-tahini sauce - both make a world of difference.For dessert we shared apricot Lebanese ice cream and baklava.  The ice cream was much creamier than expected, but the apricot flavor is very pronounced. It triggered memories of travels where we would gorge ourself on apricots and dates.  Two varieties of baklava were brought out - pistachio and cashew.  Both were much lighter on honey and had more delicate pastry than the typical baklava. It's always surprising that when ""simple"" dishes are prepared well and thoughtfully, they can go from ""good"" to ""outstanding.""  This was exactly the case at ilili.",20,16,21,Dana F.,"Queens, NY",665,925,146

5.0,5/9/2011,"This restaurant well deserves this 5 star rating.  The service we received as impeccable.  I can't express how much we appreciated how attentive our waitresses were and how awesome they handled our party.  We had a party of about 25 people for a bday party and the bday girl secured the lounge area.  It was very awkward to sit and eat in the lounge area and a little crowded but we asked the waitress if we could have an additional table to spread out at and accommodate all the food we ordered, she quickly agreed.  Since we adjusted our seats, they also had to adjust who received which dishes.  There was a little bit of confusion but they were extremely quick on their feet to adjust to the change.  Being a large party, a couple of us asked to have a separate check and the waitress was more than happy to let us.  We were asked if we wanted drinks and were never pushed to order anything from the bar.  We asked for water and our glasses were never empty during the night.  We asked for a pitcher of water for our table during the night and she was more than happy to give us one and quickly refilled it when it was low.  We ordered four appetizers on the menu.  I was a little surprised to see that the menu had changed from the last time I was there since I had a couple of favorites that were no longer on the menu.  So I did a quick yelp search and we settled on ordering the Mekanek, Lahmajeen, veal sweetbreads and duck shawarma.  The duck shawarma was my absolute favorite.  It only comes with two so if you have any more ppl eating than that, order accordingly.  The peanuty sauce made the shawarma unbelievable and there was also a sweet flavor mixed in as well.  We actually ended up getting this last and it was a great way to end the meal.  We told some other guests in our party to order it after eating it and they loved it as well.  The veal sweetbreads were my second favorite.  The lettuce cups were a total surprise (even though it says it in the description) but I loved the flavors of the sauce along with it.   The Lahmajeen was a pita topped with lamb and a yogurt sauce to go with it.  Can't go wrong with this dish.  It's very safe.  The Mekanek was my least favorite.  The sausage was a bit gamy and tasted a lot better if you threw a lot of the oil/sauce ontop of it.  Our friends also ordered the brussel sprouts that the waitresses kept raving about and I was curious to try.  While it was sweet and tasted good, I'm not sure I could eat a whole bowl of it.  It's still brussel sprouts.   They also ordered the bone marrow.  I'm not a big fan of bone marrow but when you put it together with the vegetable mixture they provided, it was excellent.  Without it, it's just fatty and greasy.  It is extremelyyyy greasy so be forewarned.  During the middle of the night, I checked in using four square and received a free rose sangria as the special.  The waitress was more than happy to get me a glass when I showed her the details.  The rose was a little too light in the sangria and the cocktail had a lot of orange juice but it was free so I was happy.At the end of the night, we did get charged a $2 cake cutting fee per person since we brought in our own cake and 20% tip was automatically charged to our bill b/c of the size of our party.  We were more than happy to pay 20%+ for the excellent service we received.  This is truly one place that deserves it and I wasn't offended or unhappy to pay it at all.",0,0,0,Kim W.,"New York, NY",19,240,31

5.0,4/22/2011,"Great atmosphere. The lighting is dim so it is a good place to have a romantic date. Additionally, the service is reliable and if you need something right away, you are sure to get what you want.The food fits my criteria for the perfect meal. It satisfies the two basic categories of quality and quantity. For starters, my gf and I had the hummus and sardines. Both dishes were extremely tasty. The bread served with the hummus can be compared to sopapillas that you get when you order a Mexican dessert, however this bread is not fried and not sweetened. The sardines lacked the fishy taste most sardine dishes have I found myself wanting more of this particular appetizer.For the main course, we split a 20 oz ribeye steak and the special of the day, red snapper fish, flash fried with minimal breading then baked with a red sauce which tasted Italian. Both dishes were absolutely amazing. We ordered the steak medium rare and I was impressed with the tenderness of the meat as well as the combination of the ""charred"" taste from being on the grill. The fish was very flaky and fell apart with ease when eaten. Both dishes went very well with the famous brussel sprouts side dish we also ate. Brussel sprouts normally have a very bitter taste, however because this dish combined a creamy ranch tasting sauce with the bitter taste of the veggies,  I had no idea I was eating what is normally a hated dish. All very very tasty!!!I would certainly go back to try other items on the menu.",0,0,0,Lawrence J.,"Philadelphia, PA",4,7,0
4.0,4/18/2011,"I've only eaten lunch here, but I will be back. Had the prix fixe (great deal) and decided to go with the Phoenician fries which, I have to say, are probably the best fries I've even had in my life along with the Lamb Dip. The lamb was definitely good too, but compared to the fires, it took second.The bread was also good, warm puffy pita, as was the cucumber, mint lemonade.The only miss was dessert, the caramelized banana bread was just eh.As for decor and service, both were excellent. Decor being a very pleasant surprise. Sleek and hip. Now I know why it's so popular for happy hour.AMENDMENT: Okay, so I went back, and this time we did mezzes as opposed to the prix fixe, which is definitely the way to go. The brussel sprout dish alone was worth the second trip. Easily the best brussel sprout dish I've ever had - and for those of you who have been to Cleo in LA, yes, this one is better.We also had several other dishes from tuna belly, to lahamajeen, to hummus and all were quite good as well. The only thing that was a bit of a let down were the stuffed grape leaves, which is a shame, because that's one of my favorite dishes- but whatevs- with everything else as good as it is, I'd put this in the top 5 med restaurants in the city without a second thought.",0,0,0,Ari H.,"Mt Kisco, NY",171,412,0

Cockails are unusual and extremely strong.  My favorite is ""From Beruit with Love"" a vodka based drink with fresh basil which is very sweet and refreshing.  It also comes in a cup the size of a bowl.  I'm not sure that I would come here for a first or second date, because it does get kind of loud and lacks that ""intimate"" vibe, but it's good for friends, couples, and groups.  In a city with a million restaurants to try, I keep going back to ilili.",0,0,0,Allie S.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,23,0
3.0,4/9/2011,"It's a swank Middle East restaurant, with one of the most pretensions in the city. The food is very good, though the pungency of the dishes we had (warm eggplant, grape leaves, duck breast kebab, etc.) was somewhat overpowering; high on garlic and lemon, but also with fresh wild greens. Priced on the high side as well. The decor is like a high end club atmosphere with a lot of modern wood trim and mirrors, not at all cozy, and with relatively loud club dance music echoing throughout.Perhaps the worst aspect of the place was the service, which while attentive gave the impression of wanting to sell, sell, sell and get us out of there as fast as possible. Granted this was a Saturday night but we had our mains delivered before one of us had finished our appetizer, without an eyeblink from the waitstaff.I imagine that on an off night when the staff was less pressured the food could stand for itself.Very good wine list as well, included several interesting Lebanese wines.This is somewhere between three and four stars for me.

My friend ordered the hot eggplant meze dish (baba ghannouj), which I expected to be puree but it was sliced and fried. It tasted yummy. The hommus's flavor was light and subtle, and it was pretty good. I loved the lamb dip, but I'm naturally biased of course.

4.0,3/30/2011,"This may be one of the fewest restaurants that I was genuinely surprised by. From the outside, it doesn't look much, especially situated in the Flatiron district. It's like a secret little gem!When you walk in, the entrance is very narrow, greeted by a server, inside the decor is very modern ""NY"" feel, the lights, atmosphere, and people are very respectful and not to be loud. Service is very attentive, asked about food, water..etcI haven't had much experience with Middle Eastern - Lebanese food, so take this review as a grain of salt. I went in for the Lunch Pre-fix Menu, which is $20 for 2 choices.My choice was the Calamari salad and the Garlic String beans. I have to say, the Garlic String beans were very savory, but extremely over salted. It was well infused with the garlic flavor, but without a pair of bread or rice, it is way too salty to eat.The calamari salad was interesting.. Instead of the usual crispy Calamari rings, this was strips of calamari with dusts of seasoning, over a bed of regular lettus, and oversized pieces of green bell pepper. (Not a fan of bell peppers).. again, maybe my choices were wrong, but both seemed to be extremely salty. Wish I had a side of rice or something to wash it down.The portions were relatively small for a $20 dollar meal, but the atmosphere and non-rushed service makes it very pleasant.

5.0,3/27/2011,"Possibly the best overall dining experience I've had in NYC; every single aspect was superb.The decor is cool and very New York. Three rooms: the lounge/bar, which had a great vibe--not too pretentious or overly scene-ster, but a classy, cool vibe without trying too hard. Main dining room is cool too, but cool as in impersonal and unimpassioned--high ceilings plain furnishings and lights a little too bright. My friend mentioned 'cafeteria' in her impression, but I think that's a bit much. The third room is a little fancier, with white tablecloths and a darker, more intimate feel. Our server was absolutely fantastic, if a little longwinded. He was quick to make suggestions (all of which we took) that turned out to be excellent. Our waiter really was a professional--extremely well-informed, friendly and obliging, but not at all overbearing. He was also quite handsome, which is always a nice treat ;). The only thing he really dropped the ball on was getting us our check when we were finally done. Major rookie move.The food at Ilili is extraordinary. We ordered too many dishes to name and recommend them all, but I will say that the chankleesh and warm eggplant were favorites and should not be passed up. Honestly, every single item, from the pita to the kabobs to dessert (get the candy bar), was so superb that I'm sure everything on the menu is. Order as many dishes as your party can manage and share everything so that you can sample all the deliciousness.

5.0,3/21/2011,"ilili was on my wish list of New York City restaurants for quite some time. I recently met up with a friend for an upscale Lebanese dinner here. We decided to try the $42 prix fixe dinner, which allowed each of us to select 2 appetizers, 1 entrée, and a dessert. That meant tons of sharing! Before even making our selections, we were served a plate of crackers with labne (strained yogurt), za'atar, and olives.Between the two of us we had 4 appetizers to try out. Our definite favorite was the Veal Sweetbreads dish. Plump sweetbreads are breaded and fried just like fried chicken and served in a lettuce cup with garlic whip and kabiss (pickles). This was the standout dish from the night... it was well-balanced from it's texture to its flavors. We highly recommend it.Our next favorite was the Sweet Cheese, a baked Halloumi topped with winter vegetables, apples, and sumac. This gooey starter also had some great textural elements with the addition of crunchy julienned apples on top. Fresh (and super puffy) pita bread was a great vessel for enjoying this baked cheese.We also enjoyed the Fennel Cured Sardines with piquillo peppers, garlic, fresh fennel, that is served with grilled bread. The sardines were not overly fishy, and although the peppers and fennel added nice bright flavors to the dish, it was a touch on the oily side.Our final appetizer was the Marinated Octopus and Calamari Salad with carrot tahini, sweet pickled cucumber and nigella seeds. The octopus and calamari were quite tender with a nice crunch from the pickles. Overall, my friend found the dish to be a little sweet for her taste, but I thought the flavors worked well together.For our entrées we both ordered red meat dishes. my friend went with beef, the Date Braised Beef with cashew ""couscous,"" cucumber, and rose petals to be exact. It was beautifully tender with a delicate sweetness from the dates, a concept I'd love to borrow in my own kitchen sometime.My main course was the Lamb Kebab, which consists of marinated lamb loin and cherry tomatoes served on a spiced pita along with a side of garlic whip and a light arugula salad. The lamb was not only seasoned just right, but was cooked to perfection, moist bite after bite. The grilled cherry tomatoes added a touch of sweet and juicy acidity. The pita itself was crunchy. I'm not sure if that was a result of it cooling down and drying out, but it made me think of it more as a Lebanese taco :) The garlic whip is a garlic-lovers' dream, a creamy garlic infusion. It reminded me a bit of the famous Zankou Chicken garlic sauce (one of the greatest inventions of mankind). When I finished my lamb, I wanted to slather the remaining sauce all over myself (to ward off vampires, of course). I restrained myself. Don't worry.For dessert I couldn't resist the ilili Candy Bar, a decadent layered treat of chocolate kataifi and chocolate ganache served with pistachio and fig caramel and finished table side with warm chocolate sauce. The chocolate kataifi layer had a great crunchy texture while the ganache was nice and smooth. While this is definitely a rich dessert, it's a great option for any chocolate-lover. I recommend it.My friend tried the Apricot Lebanese Ice Cream, which had a lovely floral flavor in addition to apricot. I found the texture reminiscent of Lokum (or Turkish Delight), it was almost toothsome, definitely a unique trait in ice cream. I imagine it is made with a similar method or similar ingredients. I'd love to research this more. We both really enjoyed this ice cream!I recommend ilili to anyone who enjoys fine dining and Middle Eastern cuisine. The cuisine at ilili is definitely a lovely variation to the traditional dishes one would find at a typical hole-in-the-wall Middle Eastern or Lebanese restaurant. The flavors were spot on, the proteins were cooked perfectly, and not a single ""boring"" bite of food touched our lips.",3,1,3,Victoria K.,"Cranston, RI",579,664,2519

My friend and I were seated in a small tight space and it was not all that comfortable. There were plenty of other open tables where we would have been more comfortable, however, we suspected that because we were younger (but still dressed very nicely), we were placed in a more tight location.Our waiter took a while to come to us, so the service wasn't exactly on par. This wasn't exactly the busiest of times, we had arrived at dinner at around 6 and the restaurant wasn't even half packed, so we did expect a little better service. There were times we could not even find our waiter, he just simply disappeared from sight.The food we ordered was good however, and so it redeemed the restaurant. The Phoenician fries were delicious and I was glad we took the recommendation of our waiter. Unfortunately, the beers we wished to try (Israeli) were out, as well as the other type of unique beer they offered.

5.0,3/7/2011,"AMAZING!  This is just one of many words I would use to describe this fine restaurant.  This place was a last minute recommendation by a friend and it did not disappoint.  The décor and ambience was very nice.  I had called ahead for a lunch reservation and once we arrived we were promptly seated.  We started off with a round of drinks from the specialty cocktail menu.  I ordered the Fresh Meadow, which has gin, St.Germain, mint, cucumber, and ginger.  The drink was DELCIOUS!  We ordered the following appetizers:  Jalapeno Hommus, Lamb Meatballs, & Garlic/Cilantro Shrimp.  Each one of these dishes was scrumptious and perfectly flavored.  We decided to order from the price fix lunch menu which includes once side and one main entrée.  I am a huge lamb fan and was excited that Ilili had such a variety of dishes with lamb.  After going back and forth between what to order I decided on the Braised Lamb Shank sandwich.  I would not regret this choice!  The lamb was perfectly cooked and flavored.  All the components of the sandwich went perfectly together.   As a side I got the Phoenician Fries which were wonderful and creative.  Everyone else was equally satisfied with their dishes as well.  I have tried many Mediterranean restaurants and this is one of the best.  From the ambience, to service, to food this place gets 5 stars.  I will definitely recommend and visit this place again in the future!",2,1,1,Sayjul P.,"Raleigh, NC",456,164,82
4.0,3/3/2011,"A la Scott goes lebonese with a vibe.  Oh yeah!  It's hard to go wrong in the ecclectic space with a loud-young and youthful vibe. But the menu is anything but.  Sophisticated and varied-- Ilili's menu is overwhelming a first but be patient and experiment with everything. And with a knowledgable wait staff, no fears on asking for recommendations. Hummas,Tahitini, roast brussse sprouts and duck schwarma are fabulous choices just to name a few.  Go for anything lamb cause it's done just right.  Lamb sausage is one if my favorites. If you are not so daring go for the mixed grill.  It offers a sampling of expectable yet uniquely middle eastern fare.The space is awesome and the price point very good for upscale and a real NY scene.  A somewhat daring menu but mainstream enough to draw from the foodies to those who just want something good-different-upscale and with a vibe.

4.0,3/3/2011,"Important to note, I'm not a big fan of Mediterranean food. With an exception of the halal cart on 56th street. The spices are good, but it just doesn't quite do it for me. Despite my lack of enthusiasm for Lebanese dishes, Ilili went beyond my expectations and unraveled a happily happy Thursday night for my party and I. The prices are very reasonable. For $42/person Prix Fixe dinner, we were offered choices of two appetizers, one main dish and one dessert.  Not bad. We ordered the following:AppetizerFalafel: fava bean dumpling / tahiniWarm Eggplant: tomato / tamarind molasses / scallionsMekanek: lamb sausage / lemon butterMarinated Octopus & Calamari Salad: carrot tahini / sweet pickled cucumber nigellaMain dishChicken Shish Taouk: chicken breast / garlic / lemonDaily specialDessertHomemade Lebanese Ice Cream: milk  and chocolateEverything was delicious.

3.0,2/26/2011,"Came here the other night for a pre-theater dinner. Bf had a glass of Lebanese red wine (not bad, not great, but we had to try it, right?) and I had a ""Lebanese American"" cocktail: bourbon, mint, and arak, an anise flavored spirit -- sort of a Mediterranean answer to ouzo, sambuca, etc. Weirdly, they have the stuff in Bali, too... but I digress.The place is huge, but partitioned in such a way as to not feel cavernous. Evidently there are three private dining rooms. There are many big tables in the main dining room -- this is a good place to go with a big group. The bar area is lounge-y, with low banquettes and tables, and was getting pretty busy as we wrapped up our early dinner. The amuse bouche/bread basket of crispy flat bread served with yogurt and olives is a perfect start to the meal. We did what we usually do and ordered a few dishes to share. Deciding not to go for the regular hummus and baba and falafel, we opted for things that seemed little more unusual. The sweetbreads ($15) are prettily presented but they need less bread and more gland. (The breading is well seasoned, though.) The green beans with tomato and garlic are fantastic, but $11 seems a bit pricey. The risotto ($15) is made with freekeh, a green wheat cereal, instead of rice. It has a lovely texture, balanced by tender carrots and other winter vegetables. And since we'd heard the hummus was delish, we found a way to mix classic and creative with the lobster hummus. It sounds weird, but I think it really works. The portion isn't enormous, although it was the largest dish out of our four choices, but for $28 you get a nice chunk of tail and claw meat, a generous helping of honshimeji and oyster 'shrooms served on a big ole dollop of really terrific hummus. They do the fresh pita thing here, bringing you a basket of hot puffy pitas with your meal, which is perfect because you're going to want to scrape up every last bit of the sauce in all these dishes. Because they're really tasty. And spendy.I must say dessert was incredible. The caramelized banana bread is moist and plays well with the creme anglaise on which is sits. It has thinly sliced bananas atop it -- caramelized, naturally -- golden brown and crunchy sweet. The milk ice cream (with chocolate chips) at the other end of the long rectangular plate is light by comparison. And then there's the Ilili candy bar: chocolate kataifi crunch, chocolate ganache, caramel, chocolate sauce. It's like a giant stick of fudge-covered Halvah, swimming in warm chocolate sauce. Ridiculous. Get Turkish coffee with dessert; the dark bitterness of the strong coffee helps to temper the raging sweetness of the desserts, which I am ashamed to say we had absolutely no trouble finishing.I'll come back here for the prix fixe ($20 for lunch, $42 for dinner) and to check out the bar.

5.0,2/24/2011,"""Just like my grandma used to make"". That's what I kept thinking as I devoured each dish I ordered from Ilili.  Up until last night, every Lebanese restaurant in the city that I tried always fell well short of expectations for a good meal.  To put it simply, Ilili is the best Lebanese restaurant in NYC and now the only place outside of my mom's or teta's (for those of you who don't habla arabic, teta is ""grandmother"") kitchen that I'll go to for Lebanese food.  I went last night for a work dinner and ordered:- hommus: perfect.  consistency was smooth, not chunky, and wasn't overpowered by lemon or garlic.  - labne: again, perfect. - chankleesh: delicious and light- kibbeh nayeh: it's like steak tartare with spices.  Like grandma used to make.  I'm going back to Ilili solely for this dish. Don't sleep on this dish.- Chicken Shish taouk: amazing. chicken was delicious and very tender.- Kafta: delicious as well. Though wasn't as tender as I liked.  Still would order again though.The portions are generous and unfortunately I was too full to order dessert ( a first for me); but the dessert menu looked very promising.  Service was attentive and friendly and the space is very lounge-like.  Given the food quality and good portion size, the prices are reasonable.  Bottom line is that i will be going back here next week.",2,1,1,Daniel K.,"San Francisco, CA",4,20,0

Another nice perk was the service - from the bar area to the dining area to the restrooms even. One of my friends thought the service was almost too attentive but I will happily take overly attentive servers over most of what you find in NYC! I also liked that the place had a decently sized lounge area where I could have as pleasant a wait as possible prior to my friends' arrival.

4.0,2/13/2011,"ilili makes palindromes fun to say ! "" racecar"" and "" go hang a salami Im a lasagna hog"" (Credit to Yelper Doug G!) are also good ones! We mostly took advantage of the 2011 restaurant week special @ ilili. After sloshing through the cold disgusting wintry mix on the ground, we arrived at this warm, beautiful restaurant. I adored the high ceilings, the wood panels and the wide open space in the main dining room. ilili is quite friend-friendly. All of the tables have room for 4 or more seats giving it a welcoming atmosphere for groups of friends. Food is served family style so you're going to be sharing, too!First Courses -Falafel - Amazing in so many ways. It was fresh and crispy on the outside, warm on the inside. Not dried out, not overly spiced.. just.. perfect. It puts the shame all of the falafel I've ever eaten.Mekanek- Lamb sausage, pine nuts and lemon zest. I only ate one of these and thought they were agreeable. I was told they tasted like lamb flavored breakfast sausage.Harissa & Amontillado Shrimp- Toasted almond with flavorful shrimp that possessed just a hint of spice. It was on the border of being slightly overcooked.. but was still mighty fine! Came out in a chilli's-esque cast iron bowl. Baba Ghannouj -  It came with warm pita that was puffed up like marshmallows. The eggplant was finely ground, the tahini was slightly overpowering and it was very thick and pastey. It had the consistency of potato pancake mix(batter). The oil and the pomegranate seeds on top were a nice touch but I wasn't overly impressed with the dish.  Main Courses- I don't order lamb very often, and when I do I expect it to be realllly good. I mean, the last thing I want is to get stuck in my head is an image of Shari Lewis and Lamb Chop singing  "" THIS is the song that never ends..  "" stuck in my head. Ugh. Anyway..Lamb is notorious for being fatty. I,myself, can not stand even a spec of gelatinous animal fat. In fact, It's one of the reasons I often avoid most red meat and pork. I specifically asked our waitress if it was fatty, she told me ""not at all"" so I figured, ""Ok, this is ilili, they'll have an amazing cut meat"". Everyone has raved about the lamp chops! WRONG. It took me about 15 mins to dissect the two deliciously flavored albiet tiny chops. I barely got any meat out of them after chopping around the gooey fat. Ughh. -0.5 stars. I ended up ordering an additional main course that was much more pleasing to my palate: Chick'unn!  The Chicken Shish Taouk is the lebaneese version of a chicken shish kabob. It has a distinct grill-fire taste and spice. Delicious! Duck Marget Kebab - Same grill-fire finish as the chicken. Moist and served with mint and baby argula. Desserts -Yelpers do not lie, the candy bar is a chocoholic's wet dream. Fudgey crunchy goodness in my mouth. It's small, but not overrated at all. Ooo.. I would've eaten five!!My favorite ice cream has always been fairly unusual -- Pistachio. Cookies n' cream, Coffee and Cookie dough most often take the back seat to the creamy-mint green colored treat I love. The Pistachio ice cream at ilili is quite different from your typical friendly's soft serve pistachio. While not terrible by any standards, it will confuse any die hard pistachio lover. It has a wonderful creamy consistency. At first bite you'll notice a very distinct floral taste. While eating, It conjured up images of a rose flavored hookah or  perfume while I heard someone else bluntly call it "" dove soap"". Our server gabby pointed out after our meal that it was a ""traditional"" dish made with rose water. Ahhh.. Ok. Makes sense. Drinks-The wine list didn't really do anything for me so we ordered a bunch of mixed drinks.The Poison Sumac Margarita was indeed tasty but From Beirut to passion was my favorite cocktail by far/ It tasted like a grapefruit mojito party in my mouth. Yum!  The AWAK?ARAK? Quack Quack? Tasted like star anise, black licorice and elderflower. I appreciated the free sample they gave us but I wasn't so hot on it. Thanks but no thanks ilili, not my thing. Bathrooms are absolutely and positively unusual. I was confused and you will be too!! Overall Food Scoreboard:Great: 6/9 dishesAverage: 2/9 dishesNo Bueno: 1/9 dishes TL;DR: Beautiful space, Above average food but avoid the fatty lamb and weird ARAK. I struggled to give ilili 4, as the entire experience was about 3.75sh stars. I rounded up for good measure. Try it !",3,3,2,Steph M.,"Long Island, NY",403,525,667
4.0,2/13/2011,"I very much appreciate the perks of New York City and their wonderful marketing technique of RESTAURANT WEEK! Or should I say Restaurant WeekSSSSSSS! Anyway, me and my friends planned to go here for our first restaurant week trip! It was a group of 7 of us and we were treated well! The service was amazing. Our waitress offered to explain everything on the menu and answer whatever questions we had! She also recommended a great wine for the table as well! The place was huge! Two stories I believe and the bathrooms were fancy. Just had to point that out. Ha! I loved the atmosphere. We were able to choose TWO appetizers EACH to start off with. I went with the hummus and the tuna belly. The hummas was good, but the pita bread didn't refull fast enough for me to eat a lot of it. I could have passed on it. The tuna belly was AMAZING. It was cooked to perfected and tasted delicious. It came with three fairly large pieces! So good! I also tried my friends egg plant and falafal. They were both tasty as well. The shrimp and tomato was good too! It wasn't as spicy as the waitress described it to be. Moving on to the main course.I ordered the fried skate while everyone else ordered the grilled chicken. I enjoyed my skate very much. It was the first time eating skate. The texture was odd. Skate isn't really fish. It's more like a ""ray"" so the texture was a mixture of fish and stringy chicken. Don't let my description turn you off though. The dish was very good. It came with a side of veggies and a puree of lentils. Yum! I enjoyed it very much. I also tried my friend's chicken. That was good as well. But I liked my skate better! =]For dessert mostly everyone got the candy bar. Some got ice cream. The ice cream was very..  flowerly. I didn't like that. I like to smell flowers, not eat or taste them. The candy bar was super sweet, but I loved it all the same. I have a sweet tooth! The experience was great and very enjoyable!

The entrance is unassuming, probably because of the scaffolding outside, but once you walk in, the place just opens up in front of you. It was booming on a Friday night - actually made me feel like I was part of the city nightlife again, but in an older, classier, non-fratlike kinda way. The bartenders and servers were all really friendly and knowledgeable. The server at the table gave us great suggestions on what to order on the menu as well as what wine to drink with our meal. Even the food runners were friendly and accommodating. The Restaurant Week deal was pretty impressive too: 2, that's right, two appetizers, 1 entree, and a dessert for the prix fixe price. Since there were 4 of us, we decided to each order something different and share the plates. Turned out to be a fantastic tasting dinner. All of the small plates were tasty; I'd highly recommend the warm eggplant and lamb tartar (I don't even like lamb, and this was delicious!) There wasn't one dish I wouldn't order again, to be quite honest. Even the choices of desserts were interesting: definitely order the chocolate bar, you will not be dissappointed.Maybe it was the long week I had before this dinner that made me crave for some indulgence. Maybe it was the great company I was with, or maybe it was just that the place serves really really great food. I'm sure it was all of the above, because I had a fantastic time here. I'm hesitant to give this place 5 stars because it's just not a thing I do too often. If I could give this place 4.5 stars I would, but alas...

Right from the smiling coat check lady to the recomendations from the servers to the lady in the bathroom who hands you paper napkins to wipe your hand (maybe that one's a bit creepy), the service element is impressive.Now on to the food and drinks. The drinks, while pretty strong, usually hit the mark with the flavour and ingredients. The bourbon+orange flower water cocktail is my favourite, while I remember being less impressed with the phoenician lemonade. They also serve Arak, an anise flavoured grape liquor - similar to Ouzo but poured ceremoniously in the Lebanese fashion into ice cold water, transforming the clear liquid into a milky emulsion.. ahh magic. Sorry I got carried away there. I just love anise so much.I always try to come to Ilili in a big group because that means I get to sample many many of the dishes that I have come to love. Their warak enab is excellent , as is the baba ghanoush, hummus and labne. Also big hits are the phoenician fries and the batata harra, that have a nice kick from the spices. I am less fascinated by the mouhamara (a bit bland) and the warm eggplant (ooh those tamarind molasses make my mouth pucker!).The brussel sprouts dish is insanely yummy, but I must warn you it was made for a sweet tooth. The grapes cut the richness and the walnuts complement the sweetness of the dish. And you can use that unlimited supply of fresh, fluffy, hot pita to mop up the last bits of the fig puree/mint yogurt from the bowl. It's just insane, what else can I say.After reading Atif's review, I went back there again and this time I tried the famous candy bar dessert.

4.0,2/7/2011,"The Restaurant Week brunch at Ilili was a wonderful treat in a whimsically beautiful setting with extremely attentive service and excellent company.  Ilili came highly recommended by my legendary eater friend, Dan C., so I knew that I had to go try it.  That they were serving up Restaurant Week bargains was the cream cheese icing on the cake.For $24.07 a person, we each selected an entree and a side.  Brunch cocktails including bloody marys, mimosas and pomegranate cava were available for $5 each, truly a bargain in this neighborhood at this caliber of eatery.  I believe that the normal brunch is $27, which includes the entrée, side and a cocktail, so it may be an even better deal depending on your level of preferred brunchtime inebriation.1. Ashta Stuffed Awaimat - we were delightfully surprised by a complimentary starter of Lebanese Beignets!  The dense beignets worked well with the clotted cream, but the star of the show was the astonishingly flavorful orange blossom simple syrup.  Don't be shy - be sure to cut up your beignet and dip it in this sugary delight!2. Chakchouka Eggs in Cocotte - three plump poached eggs in a small cast iron pan swimming in a fragrant tomato based sauce accompanied by a dressed nest of arugula and four falafel-shaped, perfectly crisp hash browns.  The dish was lovely, and even after the eggs were gone, we found ourselves mopping up the sauce with pita bread3. Mekanek Egg Manouche - a whole wheat pita pizza covered liberally in a layer of lamb sausage bits and olive oil then topped with three poached eggs.  The best way to eat it seemed to be to cut in thirds and fold in half pizza style with the egg in the middle so as not to lose any of the precious yolk!  Since El Queso Grande ordered this, I freely took some bites out of it.  It was delicious!4. Chankleech Egg Manouche - similar to the Mekanek Egg Manouche, this dish was a whole wheat pita pizza covered in a layer of chankleech cream, which my friend described as being similar to cheese.  As an aspiring vegetarian, he gave me all of his basterma, which is a delicious cured beef.  I gratefully accepted and wolfed it down (with some help from El Queso Grande)5. Lamb Burger - while I did not get to sample this, the burger was large and looked perfectly cooked6. Hommus - at our waiter's suggestion, I ordered the hommus for my side.  It was very tasty and served with a generous pool of olive oil and pita bread for the table.  I would have liked to try the shrimp or lobster hommus but that will have to wait for next time7. Batata Harra - cubed potatoes (about the size of mini dice) with great seasoning.  The portion was pretty large and tasty8. Fattoush - a large bowl of leafy Lebanese saladAfter our feast, although there was still food on the table, we had absolutely no room for dessert, much to our collective disappointment.  We immediately vowed to return to taste more, and we undoubtedly shall!  Feeling chatty, we lingered at the table well after we paid the bill, and the staff was very accommodating.  They even came back to refill our water twice!PARTING THOUGHT: I don't know much about Lebanese food, but this was pretty awesome!  Be sure to check out the cool bathrooms!",2,1,3,Ida C.,"Singapore, Singapore",329,437,852
4.0,2/7/2011,"This is a review for ilili's restaurant week menu. Reservation: We had a reservation for 8:30pm on a Friday night. We got there right at 8:30pm. The restaurant was packed and ""happening"" that night. The hostess told us to get seated at the bar and she will find us when a table becomes available. We were seated at 9:15pm. So tip: Get there early with your group all there and you can hopefully get seated on time. Appetizers:All 4 of us were fans of the appetizers. With restaurant week, each of us could select 2 dishes each. Each dish was shareable. So we took the liberty and ordered as many different dishes that looked good or made us drool just from reading the descriptions. We got the following:1. Hommus - Can't go wrong with this dish. 2.Baba Ghannouj - This dish is a like a party in your mouth and makes you want to continue eating it until its gone. It was gone. 3. Warm Eggplant - this eggplant was deep fried and tasted like crispy vegetable chips. 4. Marinated Octopus & Calamari Salad - This was a very light dish with plenty of octopus and calamari to go around. 5. Habra - Lamb Tartare. This was an interesting dish as I never had raw lamb. Definitely lather on the sauces to enhance the taste. 6. Mekanek - There were like 7 little lamb sausages with were packed with flavor. 7. Bone Marrow - mmmmmmmm Bone Marrow . It tastes 20x better than it sounds. 8. Veal Bacon - the veal bacon comes on a pancake. The fat and flavor is amazing. Entrees:The entrees were a disappointment compared to the appetizers. The apps were fit for a king while the entrees were like two notches down in terms of favor and presentation. In terms of performance, the entrees were decent but the appetizers took the stage. 1. Duck Kebab - They only gave us 5 pieces of Duck with the bread and a side salad. The taste was good just not enough of it. 2. Lamb Kebab - Same situtaion as the duck kebab. I feel like they didn't give us enough. Good things we finished all the apps. 3. Citrus Trout - Bang for your buck. There was a lot of fish to go around. Cooked well with a lot of flavor. Desserts:I wasn't a fan of their desserts. The only one I liked out of the 4 choices was the Awaimat which was like circular deep fried donuts. Restaurant:The restaurant is very hip and modern and dim litted. There is dance music blasting in the backround so it does make it a bit hard to talk to each other across the table. Overall I like the feel of the restaurant. I would recommend people just ordering the appetizers. It was very shareable with 4 people. We got 8 apps and it satiated us.",3,0,1,Hong L.,"Brooklyn, NY",317,656,218

4.0,2/7/2011,"Restaurant week goers know that 9 times out of 10 you get shafted. It is always with some trepidation that you turn to the last page of the menu praying that you will see an option other than grilled chicken. Yet for some reason, we continue to try it out with the hope that one dinner will be worth the $35 deal. As it turns out, ilili (did I spell that right?) is the holy grail of restoweek dinners. SO MUCH FOOD. So much GOOD FOOD. Tapas. Between three of us we got baba ganoush, hummus, spicy shrimp, lamb sausage, sweet cheese, and salad. We could have gone straight to dessert from there...Dinner was braised meat, chicken with aioli, and risotto. Dessert: some sort of halvah candy bar, mini doughnuts, and clotted cream in rose water. It was just great. So much variety. The space was enormous by new york standards and would be an excellent option for larger parties. Yum.

5.0,2/5/2011,"I absolutely LOVED ilili. Our waiter, Mark (THE BEST ONE), gave great suggestions and kindly assisted our whole party of about 9 people. The restaurant week pre-fixe menu was so worth it and I left with a satisfaction of taste and hunger - I really couldn't have asked for more. There were so many different appetizers to choose from and since we went with such a big party, we got to try a little bit of everything and it was ALL delicious! According to me party, The ones that really stood out were the veal and bacon (came like little sandwiches), the bone marrow, tuna belly, and th eggplant. Might I add that the fresh pita bread with olive oil complimented many of our dishes. By the time we finished our appetizers, we all had extremely high expectations for the entrees and they did not disappoint. We all looked at each other and agreed that we would be surprised if the entrees were just as good...they were! The portion is slightly smaller than your typical entree but it was just what we needed after such fulfilling appetizers. The drinks - I had their lemonade and it tasted like a mojito to me, which I am not complaining about at all. Mark said it was a popular drink and I can see why - it was fresh, crisp, and very satisfying. Ambience - The decor was chic with an earthy tone. The bathroom is unisex! I felt like i was walking into a fitting room and each bathroom had its own sliding door. My bathroom experience still felt very private though. All in all, ilili was one of the best dining experiences I had in New York City with a fair price (even though I went for restaurant week, their regular menu is fairly priced as well).",0,0,0,Stephanie C.,"Austin, TX",348,59,259
4.0,2/4/2011,"I've been wanting to try this place since last year.. and I finally got to thanks to RW! This place definitely exceeded my expectations.The restaurant is spacious with a warm, cozy ambiance. Immediately upon entering, there is a nice lounge where people can wait for their tables. We only spent a few minutes there before we were seated.Dinner started out with a bang when both of our appetizers (2 each) came out. I had the tuna belly and the octopus/calamari salad, both of which were delicious. My friend had the lamb sausage and a big bowl of clams. The tuna belly was cooked to perfection, with the fish tender and soft inside and a light charred crunch on top to give it some texture. It was paired off nicely with some vegetables and a tasty sauce that was just a tad spicy. The calamari salad tasted very ""fresh like the lemongrass was just picked out"" (as my friend puts it). The lemon juice just brought out the flavor even more. Lamb sausages were tasty.. and the clams were very good. They're definitely not cheap with portions of clam! My only complaint here would be that one of the busboys took away my plate of calamari salad when i had a few bites left on the plate.Next, the entrees came shortly after we were finished with our delicious appetizers. I ordered the date braised beef on cous cous with rose petals. The beef was very tender and tasty, thoroughly seasoned. There were actual small pieces of flower in my dish that gave it a crunch and floral taste. Overall, an interesting dish. My friend had the chicken dish, which came with a few pieces of chicken on top of half a pita bread and a pile of green vegetables (not sure what it was). Midway thru our dinner, the waiter brought us complimentary Arak, their specialty alcoholic drink. It smelled interesting and was reminescent of some type of food but we couldn't pinpoint the source. I had one sip but didn't like it because it was too strong for me.Without much delay after the main course was finished, the desserts were brought out. I tried the Ashta, which is Labanese clotted cream (fancy word for ice cream?) with orange blossom syrup and 3 slices of banana. The banana complimented the cream very well but I felt that the syrup was way too sweet esp. after taking a few bites. My friend ordered the pistachio ice cream, which looked like my clotted cream. The table next to us ordered the ilili candy bar, which looked really good. Next time, we're trying that! Overall, I really enjoyed this restaurant experience. Each of the courses were delightful to try, with several notes of flavor. The portions are decent, the service is good (waiter checked on us a few times) and fast (we were finished with dinner in a little over an hour). Totally worth the money! Would definitely come back :)",1,2,2,Emily S.,"Oakland Gardens, NY",91,79,44
5.0,2/4/2011,"Can I just say delicious? Yes I think I shall. Three times actually. Delicious, delicious, delicious. AND unpretentious! We have a winner! I went here for Restaurant Week with family and friends. I had originally scheduled to go to Maze by Gordon Ramsey but I started comparing them on Yelp and I just had to change my reservation after all the stellar reviews at ilili. Thanks Yelp community!!Our reservation was at 6:30 pm but my boyfriend and I arrived earlier than the rest of the party. We checked out coats and decided to wait at the bar and get a drink. As I walked through the lounge to get to the bar in the back, I made a mental note of the casual yet sensuous feeling that the lounge gave with its short leather couches and tables. When we sat down at the bar, we were immediately greeted by a very smiley bartender. My boy got himself the Phoenician Lemonade. Upon his first sip, my boyfriend remarked that it tasted like a Tom Collins with lemonade in it. I proceeded to try it and found it very tasty. I could have had a few of those that night but I decided to save my stomach space for the large amounts of food that I heard was coming. Finally, the rest of my party came and we were led to our table by the host. I loved the dining room area. More specifically, I loved the ambiance of the room with its sultry lighting paired up with the eye-catching repetitions of wooden squares and right angles on the walls and ceiling.We sat down at our spacious table, and our waitress pops up within seconds asking us for our water/drink preferences. She then comes back with the complimentary tasting of Arak, which I think is known as Lion's Milk? Not sure...I had never had Arak before, so I did not know what to expect. Let's just say... I was not a fan. I hate liquorish tasting alcohol. However, it was fun to try. I analyzed the RW menu and kept notes in my head from what I had read on Yelp. I told my boyfriend I heard good things about the falafel, the lamb tartar, the lamb sausages and the warm eggplant for appetizers. For my main, I splurged and ordered the Duck Kebab and he ordered the Risotto. Here are my notes as follows:Appetizers:Falafel: The quality was ok, but not great. You receive 5-6 little balls with garnishes on top. I wish they had been hotter. I found myself lapping up the tahini sauce it came with more so than the balls themselves. They were a little crunchy on the outside but I found the inside to be lacking. These were the least favorite of the 4 for my boyfriend and I.Lamb tartar: Ohhh myyy soooo goood! I love raw meat. Give me steak tartar and tuna tartar any day of the week. I'd never had lamb tartar before so I really really wanted to try this. Let me just say that this dish was superb! There was a good 6 ounces or more of this raw lamb. It came with two garnishes in the same plate- some hot spicy red sauce (like you see at gyro carts) and this airy white sauce which had the consistency of whipped cream! Definitely a favorite for the meat lovers. Lamb sausages: These were good but not great. You receive an ample portion size of these little guys but I found myself not wanting to really finish them. If I had loved them I would have found a way to finish them lol.Warm Eggplant: Hands down the best appetizer. It's as good as everyone else has said. Do not doubt our opinions, or face our wrath!! But seriously, if you go and don't order this dish, I promise you will regret it. I don't know what they did to make this eggplant so orgasmic. I can kind of liken it to caramelizing? But with some type of sauce on it... maybe a vinegarette. Whatever they did, I think it is the most delicious version of eggplant that I have ever enjoyed in my entire life. Just thinking about it makes my mouth water.... Yes, a vegetable can make you drool! Who woulda thought!Entrees:Duck Kebab with Garlic Whip: So I begged my aunt (the one who paid for the meal) to let me get the Duck since I was the only one that didn't order a drink. She caved. YES! This duck was so yummy and juicy. It was perfectly seared medium rare like I wanted and served in perfect bite-sized chunks. Beneath it was the incredible garlic whip that I could just not get enough of. I recommend smothering this on anything and everything. Greek Vegetable Risotto:I really thought my bf chose the least promising of the entrees but his risotto turned out to be wonderful. It was thick, creamy and full of flavor with freshly shaved parmesan cheese on top that had just begun to melt into the warmth below it. He let me have a few bites of it. Thank God. Dessert (we got the same thing):Lebanese Beignet: Wow I am loving the trend of beignets for desserts for RW this year! I absolutely loved these little pastry balls. Don't miss out on them!Obviously, I am now a huge fan. I can't wait to come back to ilili again with friends to try their Happy Hour.

4.0,1/31/2011,"Underscoring several other reviewers... Ilili is great but focus on the mezze and forget the dessert (the ""candy bar"" is insipid and not worth the effort or calories). Also, I found the wine list to be a little flat/meh, though we settled on a Spanish red (Demora temp.) which went great with the food. The cocktail list was a hit with my wife and her friend.In general the food is satisfying and modern, but a little overworked... the brussel sprouts (a favorite) should really taste more like brussel sprouts, and it may just be me, but when every single spicy component is bolstered by a syrupy sweet one (prune/sour cherry/etc.) without enough acid, it weighs the food down over the course of a meal. Anyway, our favorites were the bone marrow and the cauliflower apps. Next time we'll hit the proteins harder but we had a veggie with us (and she was very happy with the offerings).The space itself is beautiful and huge. Nice bar area which offers the full menu.

I find that the prices are reasonable even outside Restaurant Week, since the food is prepared in such high quality. I'm a sucker for good lamb and this place makes the best lamb burger. It's so juicy and flavorful, I love it. I sampled my friend's lamb chops and I groaned with instant pleasure. Definitely order appetizers to share. My favorites are the Brussels sprouts (who knew they can taste good?!), burnt cheese dish (I forgot the name, it was special for that night), falafel, sweetbreads, lamb sausage, fried oysters and warm eggplant. At this rate I'm just writing out the whole appetizer menu. Be sure to listen your waiter's recommendations bc they have never disappointed me. There is complimentary coat check and if you make reservations for dinner for a party of 8, tables in the lounge are reserved for your party. Happy hour is from 5:30 - 7:30 pm - half off drinks. Regular drink prices are $14, so half off is pretty good. The only negative I have is that the waiters take away drinks pretty quickly, so hold on to your cocktails. At $14 a drink, I like to nurse it as long as I can. If you're a vegetarian you may have limited entrees. My friend had to order a bunch of appetizers to fill his stomach up.I'm not a fan of the desserts here. It's alright but nothing amazing.

4.0,1/8/2011,"Last summer, I came here with my family for Restaurant Week, and I think all of us agreed that we were pretty impressed with our evening at ilili. Unlike other restaurants (cough, Le Cirque, cough) that treat Restaurant Week diners like second-hand citizens, the service at ilili was friendly and accommodating. There's a lounge-type area in the entrance that is adjacent to the dining room, which has a nice elegant feel about it. While this isn't refined dining, I'd suggest wearing some nice clothes here.For its Restaurant Week menu, ilili lets diners choose two mezza options, one entrée, and one dessert. I've gotta say that I was really impressed and a bit surprised by how large the portions were for the mezzas; there was definitely no skimping on portion sizes. For example, there were perhaps eight or nine lamb sausages (Mekanek). Everyone at the table ordered different mezzas, and we all ended up sharing the dishes and sampling each other's choices. I thought the Da'ud Basha (lamb meatballs with tomato, onion, and pine nuts) and Octopus (with red pepper puree, pomegranate, and walnut cilantro pita crumb) were the standouts among the vast array of sampled small dishes, though every one of them was tasty.After the exceptional round of mezzas, it was almost inevitable that the next course would be a bit of a letdown. Now, don't get me wrong, my entrée (striped bass with ragout of clams and herbs, Kouzbara toast, and lemon espuma) was tasty in its own right, but the bar had been set so high at that point. For dessert, I opted for the Awaimat (Lebanese beignets with an orange blossom simple syrup), which are basically zeppoles bathed in a nice, orange-infused syrup. It was as good as you would expect sweet, fried dough to taste. Others opted for the ilili Candy Bar (chocolate Kataifi crunch, chocolate ganache, pistachio & fig caramel, and warm chocolate sauce), which I sampled and thought was pretty good, albeit a bit too sweet. Overall, the food, service, and general ambiance of ilili were great, and I would not hesitate to make a return trip or recommend this restaurant to others.",0,0,0,Kevin C.,"Manhattan, NY",70,151,870
4.0,12/31/2010,"I will write my review based on three topics: Atmosphere, Food and ServiceAtmosphere: With such a dark entrance and overhang, you wouldn't even notice ilili if you passed it on the street. When you enter, you notice that the entrance is tight, with high ceilings. This is how the lighting in most of the restaurant is. Very hip, but not good for people who have trouble seeing. The lights are dim throughout the whole restaurant.  The music is middle eastern electronica. Very cool, but i don't think my grandparents quite expected that. I almost expected a group of belly dancers to hop out of the back. The tables are also quite large, and if your are in a group of more than four people, it might be hard to hear what people across from you are saying since it is so loud.  (4 stars for Atmosphere)Food: The food was excellent.  A little misleading, because the ""Mezzas"" (appetizers) were so expensive, we quite expected a little more out of them, but in the end, we were very impressed. I had the falafel and the bok choy dish. They were both excellent. Everyone else in my party were also impressed with they dishes they got. I am vegetarian, and I had no trouble finding things to eat. (5 stars for food)Service: The service was not as excellent. Our server seemed almost offended when we asked for an extra plate of pita bread and hummus. She was nice nonetheless, but it was hard to get her attention because she was also waiting on two other large parties.  (4 stars for atmosphere)Overall I was quite pleased by my time here, and I would go back if I got the chance.  I'm going to say good for groups, because there is plenty of room for big tables, but not so good hearing wise.",1,0,1,Alana G.,"Portland, OR",27,24,3

As for side orders,  Ililli makes the best grilled beets ever-- you just want eat them forever.  The fava beans and lamb sausage were pretty good here.Top that off with excellent, attentive service, best unisex bathroom set up and good looking servers, well, what's not to love?  Only reason why I gave it a 4 instead of a 4.5 or better is that some dishes were ok and the drinks could have been stiffer or better quality.",1,0,1,Mona L.,"Los Angeles, CA",189,314,45
4.0,12/29/2010,"Definitely a different dining experience from most restaurants in New York. ilili is spacious and elegant, with round tables scattered through the establishment and a nice bar and lounge area on the side. For good Greek food, ilili is a must try. The dishes are prepared for sharing and the waiters can be pretty insistent that you split everything family-style, rather than order individual appetizers and entrees. I ordered the black iron shrimp and the duck shawarma and we got baba ghanoush and hummus for the table. The cocktails were creative and delicious as well - I had the fresh meadow, made with gin, St. Germain, mint, cucumber and ginger. I tried the Phoenician lemonade as well, which was sweet but also pretty heady. Service was great, our orders came out slowly since we went in a large group and the food was great, just not a full 5-star-hit in my opinion.",2,0,1,Nancy Y.,"San Francisco, CA",234,130,7

5.0,12/21/2010,"Objects in the rear view mirror may appear closer than they are.I got it wrong, Ilili. The Palindrome tripped me up. I didn't give you enough credit, for you gave me the answer to two challenging questions: How much thought should one give to eating dessert? How often is one held hostage by a past memory that prevents one from enjoying the present experience?After leaving the restaurant following a superlative meal, I played the ending in my mind again and again, for it was surprisingly a let down ... I had just eaten the Knafe Bil Jibneh, the warm, crisp and crumbly, cheese tart with crushed pistachios, and orange blossom sugar syrup, but had not figured out why I had not been bowled over! This was your signature dessert, and yet it did not live up to the memory of the perfect Knafeh executed at Tanoreen in Bay Ridge a couple of years back.... till after a mile of walking in the cold it finally snapped into place like a Rubik's cube, as I passed a food cart.  The nutty sesame pita pillow, that seemed superfluous to me, was the missing link. I realized that to appreciate this dessert, one needs to break the pita, fill it with the cheese tart and pour the rich orange blossom syrup over it. The toasted sesame seeds (+  pistachios) would then provide the nutty kick, followed by the crunchy chewiness of the pita, and the crispy gooey texture of the cheeses, while the syrup would add a floral sub-text to the richness of orange... a mélange of textures and flavors, both savory and sweet - surpassing even the memory of Proust's perfect Madeleine - let alone mine of Tanoreen's Knafeh.Ilili, this was my seventh meal in the last 3 years. You were very inconsistent in the first year, but you've got your act together now - because you know exactly what you aspire to be. Earlier, I could only applaud the juicy and smoky Kebabs cooked over a charcoal grill, while wondering why the foie gras was acting out Les Miserables in my companion's plate. But, now you know that the way to the heart of the dining public, when going upscale, is not to be a Tabla but to stay true to one's roots: a la Tamarind. Now I can take equal comfort in your interpretation of the Mezza. In fact, I had a vegetarian meal lately that would rank as one of the best I've had. Your vast menu reassures one of the familiar, while allowing experimentation. So, one can order the tried and tested Falafel, Eggplant, or Tabbouleh, or alternatively one could tease the palate with the fried cheese rolls and really shake things up with the Brussel Sprouts (that turn in a master class: best I've ever had). If the Black Iron Shrimp with Jalapeno and Cilantro adds a spicy kick, the Batata Hara (cubed fries with Aleppo pepper) provides a neat twist to the familiar home fries. The Beef Kebabs are my favorite in the Kebabs (marinated filet with peppers and spiced pita) and even when something misfires (Angel Hair Fatte with pita crisps, mint, yogurt), one acknowledges the variety.No dish reinforces the interpretative blend of western technique and Middle Eastern flavors more than the Ilili Candy bar. The Chocolate Kataifi crunch and the chocolate ganache, along with pistachio and fig caramel, all come together expertly - reminding one of the popular (in the region) Kit Kat bar of one's childhood, with the chocolate sauce poured table side reinforcing the warm memories of home. However, my fond memories do not feature any belly dancer gyrating to the (incongruous) music that plays in the background, and so when none materializes it reassures me that you've been thoughtful. If only you'd been modest with your own expectations of the number of patrons while renting the huge premises, it would have felt cheaper than a trip to Beirut itself. But, I will still fork over the ransom to enjoy the best Middle Eastern food in Manhattan - and create new memories.",25,16,26,Atif I.,"New York, NY",177,642,1772

5.0,12/15/2010,"It had not even been 48-hours since my return from Hong Kong but, jet-lag be damned, I was eager to meet Deidre for brunch at Ayza Wine & Chocolate Bar.  Upon our arrival, we realized that Ayza did not open until 3pm and, clearly, did not host a Sunday brunch.  ""Where to?"" Deidre asked.  We were at the crossroads of No Man's Land Street and Restaurant Wasteland Avenue.  ""Let's just walk down 5th Avenue,"" I said, ""surely, we'll run in to something.""  As we walked by ilili, a light bulb went off in my head.  I had recently read about their new brunch service and, without another option, Deidre and I decided to check it out.  Upon being seated, I took a moment and looked around at the spacious, sophisticated dining room: most of the tables were occupied by Lebanese couples and families.  This, I concluded, was a very positive sign.ilili's brunch menu is divided in to two parts: a $27 prix fixe option, which includes coffee or juice, one alcoholic beverage (Pomegranate Cava, Mimosa, or Bellini), an entrée, and a side dish; or traditional a-la-carte.  For Deidre and me, the decision to go ""prix fixe"" was a no-brainer.  Choosing which appetizer and entrée to order, on the other hand, was a bit more difficult. Our server was gracious and knowledgeable in answering questions pertaining to the menu.  Below, you will find photographs of my meal with respective descriptions captioned under each picture:To wash down my meal, I chose to alternate sipping between coffee and a flute filled with delicious Pomegranate CavaFor my entree, I chose the ""Chakchouka Eggs in Cocotte."" Served in a cast-iron skillet was a casserole-like dish composed of three sunny-side-up eggs and a deeply flavorful, spicy tomato sauce. An arugula salad and hash brown ""dumplings"" - a fancy version of tater tots - accompanied.As my side, I chose the ""Mekanek,"" which were links of fragrant lamb sausage sauteed with olive oil and lemon. These little morsels paired harmoniously with the zesty eggs.Pillowy and puffy handmade pita bread accompanied both my and Deidre's brunch entrees.~Conclusion I wasn't just impressed with my brunch at ilili, I was blown away.  From the monetary value of the prix-fixe option, to the quality of ingredients and passion added to each dish, I highly recommend sprinting, not walking, to this restaurant in order to experience this fabulous weekend treat for yourself.  There have only been a few, not even a handful of, meals that delighted me from start to finish, and this brunch at ilili was, most certainly, one of them.",1,0,1,Lindsay F.,"New York, NY",376,277,184

4.0,11/28/2010,"There are a lot of great things I could recommend about ilili. Like the elegant, spacious (!!!) dining room, great for when you're tired of involuntarily eavesdropping on fellow patrons' conversations. Or the lovely selection of mezze, or even just the brussels sprouts, which are worth at least a star alone.Instead, I'm going to pander to the lowest common denominator and talk about the Happy Hour. As someone who frequently works late, dislikes crowds, doesn't drink beer, and can't get excited about 2 for 1 deals on watery well drinks or subpar wine, I am not the natural happy-hour constituency. But every once in a while, a happy hour comes along that makes me feel like there might be something to this whole institution after all.Here, in no particular order, are some of the things that make the ilili happy hour stand out.* It runs to 7:30, so even workaholics can hope to get in at least one round.* Their mixed drinks are awesome. I am addicted to From Beirut with Passion.* Their wine selection is pretty nice too.* The servers are both hotter than average and friendlier than average.* There's a nice selection of appetizers to go along with the drinks, helpful for when you'll have to feign sobriety at social engagements following happy hour.The lounge does get crowded, but if you can grab some coworkers and snag one of the low tables, you may just find yourself wobbling out an hour later, wondering what you could possibly do with the rest of the evening that won't be anticlimactic.",4,2,2,Amy L.,"San Francisco, CA",38,129,0
3.0,11/23/2010,"I recently had my first taste of Lebanese food at ilili, with an eating buddy who was familiar with this cuisine.  I love eating with ""experts"" in cuisine types - I just sit back and let them order.  We ordered several dishes to share, and each was delicious.  We first started with beverages - I ordered a virgin Fresh Meadow with mint, cucumber and ginger while eating buddy ordered the Poison Sumac Margarita, with tequila, orange liqueur, pomegranate juice, lime, and sumac.  They were both refreshing.  I've been favoring more herb-y vegetable-type drinks lately, so the cucumber hit the spot.We started with complimentary flatbread crackers and labne (strained yogurt cheese), drizzled with olive oil and garnished with olives.  I hadn't had labne before - it is tangy, creamy and goes well with the savory crackers.Our first dish was hoummus, which is not only good but good for you. The taste was enhanced by strong olive oil and what I believe was sumac.  And what accompanied the hoummus? Soft, pillowy pita, warm from the oven.  A far cry from the tough, dry pita pockets from my local grocery store, these pita were light and airy.  I ate them quickly so they wouldn't get cold, and the waiter replaced the basket.  So I ate them again.  And again.  Dangerous game.We also had artichokes with red finger chili, mint and labne tahini to start (first picture).  I love artichoke, and this preparation showcased the tangy flavor of this vegetable.  There was a slight sour flavor that I couldn't quite place - not unpleasant, but a bit unexpected.Eating buddy ordered us the lamb ribs with burned strawberries, scallions a la plancha and cumin aleppo broth.  Lamb is generally not my meat of choice, but this dish was tender and not gamey at all.  The strawberries added a sweet and summery touch to the hearty ribs.We also had the beef shwarma.   Similar to a pita or soft taco of Greek or Mexican cuisine, shwarma consists of seasoned meat with vegetables (usually onions and tomatoes) and wrapped in pita.  It was delicious, and I especially liked that it reminded me of an ice cream cone - one-track mind, that's me. For our fish dish, we ordered the Branzino a la Plancha with tahini pepper sauce.  I admit that I was a little full by this time, but I had to give this fragrant dish a try.  I loved that the fish was so thinly filleted, allowing for a crispy skin and tender and juicy meat.  The tahini pepper sauce added a tangy counterpoint to the savory skin.Ok, so I know I had mentioned I was full by this point, but I ALWAYS have room for dessert. Always. It's a little scary, actually.  For a sweet ending, we had the Kanafe.  Usually consisting of finely shredded phyllo with Nabulsi cheese, and drizzled with rosewater syrup, this traditional dish is my eating buddy's absolute favorite dessert - when prepared traditionally.  Unfortunately, this apparently was not the best preparation.  Me, not knowing any better, still gobbled it up.  However, eating buddy was quite disappointed.Overall, I had a delicious and satisfying meal at ilili.  I love trying new cuisines, and I was not disappointed.  Sampling foods that are new to me, such as labne and sumac, is always satisfying, and I look forward to learning more about other dishes from this part of the world!",0,0,0,Serena T.,"New York, NY",105,111,610

Duck Schwarma!  From the first bite I forgot about my surroundings, closed my eyes and went into a deep meditative flavor trance.  Warm sliced duck meat cooked to perfection, with a lemony, peppery garlicky secret sauce in a toasty pita with crisp shredded lettuce is what dreams are made of.  If this were illegal I would buy it on the black market.  As a fan of mediterranean food, this Lebanese joint will not disappoint.  Plus you may score big points with your date if your conversation skills are even half as good as the food here.",0,0,0,Josh M.,"Brooklyn, NY",13,10,0

The mezzes: the brussels sprouts which apparently everyone raves about, is essentially roasted brussels sprouts with yogurt and fig puree on it which definitely was something I have never had before.  We tried the baba ghannouj and hummus which were both very silky.  The steak tartare was not what we expected.  I liked it while the majority of our party did not.  Also had the green beans, cauliflower (the yogurt here was very good, we kept dipping our pita in it!), lamb meatball, lamb sausage, feta cheese.  Glad we got to try a lot of things.  For my entree I had the lamb chops, cooked perfectly, came with 2 chops and a slice of an herbed tomato.  They really should choose a different plate to serve the lamb chops as it made it very difficult to eat.  My dinner companions seem to enjoy their young chicken and chicken shish although I did not try those dishesFor dessert, stick with the beignet or chocolate candy bar.  Whatever you do, stay away from the lebanese ice cream.  When the waiter was describing it as floral, he should have said that it tastes like a bar of soap.  We had 2 orders of the ice cream that was left untouch after our initial bites.  The candy bar was great, the fig caramel on the side was delish!  We voiced our dislike for the ice cream, and was disappointed that our waiter did not offer another dessert in place of those for us!  Nevertheless, may actually return but definitely for the tasting menu, otherwise kind of overpriced.",0,0,0,CE C.,"New York, NY",3,323,0

The food, for starters. Usually my boyfriend and I (okay maybe just I) go a little crazy when we do tapas/small plates style dinners, but I'd eaten a large lunch and wasn't very hungry so we ordered 3 mezzas and one from the grill: the bok choy, mekanek (lamb sausage), spicy octopus & calamari, and a small/single order of duck kabob. The bok choy had this delicious sauce drizzled on top that was super tasty - definitely a fave of mine. The mekanek was FAN-TASTIC, probably the best part of the meal for me even though I didn't eat too much of it just because I didn't want to fill up on sausage. It didn't taste like your average merguez - it had a delicious flavor all its own and wasn't as heavy or greasy as I'm used to from most places. The octopus & calamari was heavy on the paprika (which I liked) and the sauce was perfect for dipping warm pita bread into. The duck was surprisingly my least favorite of the 4 dishes we had, but I also first tried it without any of the seasoning that came with it. My boyfriend fully enjoyed it, though.Our server was also very friendly and helpful. My one complaint would be the drink I ordered - the Phoenician Lemonade. It was a cocktail with a bunch of different citrus-y liquers and citrus vodka, but I'm pretty sure they also dumped in some extra sugar. I took one sip and sent it back for a plain lemon vodka + tonic.

I was thinking, ""Oh sure, lamb chops, medium rare, had it a dozen times"" excepting the usual semi-luke warm and bloody lamb chop without a lot of flavor. Damn I was wrong. And how good it tasted to be wrong. The juiciest, most delicately flavored lamb chops I have ever had. I will definitely return just for this dish.4. Drinks are passable.

It was our first time trying Lebanese food, so we wanted to get a variety of things.1.Large Lamb :Kebab marinated lamb loin cherry tomatoes/ spiced pita $36 This was pretty good, but we should asked for the meat to be well done, because it was too rare  for our liking. 2.Beef Kebab : marinated fillet shishito peppers / spiced pita $24 The Beef was a little more well done, but the flavor was not a vibrant as the Lamb.Both the Lamb and the Beef came with spinach leaves and complimentary pita bread.3. Phoenician Fries : sumac / parsley / garlic whip $9 These were delicious, especially the parsley garlic whip.4. Riz :Lebanese rice/toasted vermicelli / mixed nuts $8 The rice was too seasoned, usually  I like rice that is plain with mild seasoning so the flavor from the gravy on the meat can be a a compliment to the flavor.Of course I had to check out the restroom and was very pleasantly surprised. I felt like I entered my own  powder room and had personal attention. It was very clean and modern and if I could I would have stayed in there a little longer waiting on the chase for my sisters and enjoying the tranquility of the overall decor.

4.0,8/9/2010,"As an Arab I find Middle Eastern or Arabic cuisine served in the West to be a little in duplicitous territory. Perhaps there's an element of that sentiment to almost anyone who belongs to a culture, nation, or region that warrants its own cuisine. There always seems to be an inevitable sort of entitled cynicism that will always challenge a dish's authenticity.When first exposed to Ilili (""tell me"" in Arabic), and its haute twist on Lebanese cuisine, I was hardly charmed. Middle Eastern food in general does not fuse well with other kitchens. Perhaps that notion stems from the cuisine's expectations to never digress to anything but the authentic. Ilili challenges this and with good intentions. Nonetheless, I must assert before I go on, that Lobster Hommus is blasphemous no matter what.A successful attempt to fuse Middle Eastern cuisine with the non-traditional; Duck Shawerma is made of rotisserie magret, fig, green onion, and garlic whip. It makes for quite the appetizer. Served in a pita-like envelope, wrapped and propped in a cone-like contraption, it retained that meaty, beautifully seasoned flavor that transports you to the shawerma stalls in downtown Amman.Pomegranate spangled Baba Ghanouj stays true to its classic simple stature, remaining a no frills, delicious and silky, smokey eggplant purée. Kusa Bi Laban is artfully made, a modification to the typically stuffed zucchini variety. In this rendition, zucchini spaghetti is macerated in yogurt, lamb, garlic, and mint.Pushing the envelope, I opted for something just as adventurous as the duck starter but perhaps a little less defining of the Arab kitchen. Arnab Bi Bitinjaan, hardly resonated with me as typically Middle Eastern yet all its components were. A bodacious date glazed rabbit leg nested on a bed of eggplant was cooked to release the most caramelized of flavors, thanks to the oomph, I'm sure, that the date glaze provided. Chopped fresh beans were also served alongside a chilled tomato compote.A truly outstanding moment took place when we finally decided on dessert. The Labné Cheesecake Napoleon was a clever fusion of east and west. Frankly, filo dough sandwiched and stacked with a rose water Labné cream cheese filling could not have said Middle Eastern with a twist any better. Baklava or Kinaffe just seemed too humdrum at this point. Excitingly, the dish was served amongst candied strawberries and the most peppery of granitas.",2,0,1,Faris H.,"New York, NY",7,55,0
4.0,8/7/2010,"Made reservations for a goodbye dinner for some international co-workers who were leaving the following day. The only reservation time on open table was 5:30 so we just booked it, but we ended up being late and  arriving at 6pm only to find the place more or less empty. A few of the others had arrived on time and were at the bar taking advantage of their half -off happy hour drinks. We were seated soon after and found out that the happy hour drink prices did not apply to guests who were eating at a table (as opposed to the happy hour apps at the bar). What? How ridiculous. I made my way over to the bar to get my half priced drink. A couple of my friends joined me a few minutes later. The bartenders were so inattentive we decided to split up in hopes of getting their attention a little faster. One of them finally went over to my friends and asked them if they were eating there. When they said yes, she told them that they were ineligible for the happy hour prices, so they just headed back to the table. Upon hearing this, I slyly slid into a seat at the bar and waited to order my drink. Took so long for either of them to notice me, they were seriously avoiding eye contact. Listen ladies, you are not there to sit around and look pretty, you're there to serve me drinks. I don't know whether they are actually that slow or if they just slow down their pace to keep from having to sell too many drinks at half price but either way it is extremely annoying. Speed your shit up, I do not have all day to wait for you to saunter over to get my order. It took at least 15 minutes to get my order, bring me my drink, run my card, and get me my receipt... and there were 2 bartenders and only about 5 other patrons who already had their drinks. Absolutely ridiculous. I would have given this place 3 stars if the cocktail (gin, st. germain, cucumber, ginger, mint) and the food didn't knock my socks off. Got back to my table just in time to order. The waiter was nice and the guy filling up our water glasses was friendly (and cute!). We all decided to just order a couple of dishes each. I got the duck kebab and the black iron shrimp. Around the table we also had a haloumi and corn dish, some delicious hummus, artichoke dip, and herbed fries w/ a yummy sauce. All of the dishes were absolutely amazing!!! Oh man, I am drooling just thinking about it. Now I'm feeling hungry again, damnit. Walking in I was expecting to spend $40-50 per person but was pleasantly surprised when our bill came to $35, minus my drink. I thought that was a fairly good value for the quality of the food and the amount that we got for it. I was pretty stuffed walking out of there. The atmosphere of the place is great, liked the decoration, and the tables are well spaced so you can comfortably chat with your friends. This place is great for large parties.

Since our waiter stated that we could do the substitute, ilili honored our request for dessert and charged us only $25 for a three course brunch -- sweet!I had the Fresh Fruit Katayef (a Lebanese-style pancake with orange blossum syrup, cut strawberries, toasted almonds, and a sweetly-scented cheese) and it was divine. The different flavors came together in each bite and contrasting textures made each forkful feel new. I was smitten with my brunch item and thought that brunch couldn't get better, but then I had their pomegranate cava and swooned again.

4.0,7/20/2010,"ilili pulls off what many gorgeous restaurants cannot; it offers an exciting lounge area, plus fabulous food.  You can actually enjoy a full evening of fun at the spot, drinking and eating until your heart is content.  The vibe is hip and trendy, but the food does not suffer because of it.  The large lounge includes sprawling banquettes adorned with velvet cushions and spacious coffee tables.  The space is perfect for large groups and parties.  Two packed dining rooms compose an elegant environment with soaring ceilings and dynamic, architecturally-advanced decor.  The consistently full space and lure of unique Lebanese food drew me in, but the food brought me back a second time.On my initial visit, my companion and I found the service rather irritating.  Our robotic and annoyingly persistent waitress continued to interrupt our conversation with her script-like efforts to advise and feed us.  She was so pushy, in fact, that the majority of her assigned tables were oddly chowing down on the same dishes, though the menu was extremely lengthy.  Luckily, my return trip was celebrated with a friendly and helpful waiter, redeeming my faith in their service.Instead of a traditional beginning to our meal, ilili thought outside of the bread basket by delivering a platter of Mediterranean-seasoned flat-breads with a strained yogurt spread and some fragrant green olives.  I drank down the crumbly crisps with a signature cocktail called the Fresh Meadow.  The beverage was a blend of gin, St. Germain liquor, mint, ginger, and a swizzle stick of cucumber.   The $13 glass was lacking in alcohol potency and ginger pizazz, but it was tart and refreshing nonetheless. The menu began with a selection of hot and cold mezzas (appetizers) and continued to list several larger plates.  However, the restaurant's concept centered around sharing.  Once the food began to arrive, it was served with some hot, inflated pita breads.  The hollow rounds were moist and delicious.  A cold starter of Mouhamara was composed of three mounds of sassy, rich sun-dried pepper mousse.  The spicy flavor was slightly sweetened by pomegranate molasses.  A few crunchy walnuts added texture, but the plate could have used some additional nuts.  Warm, crisp Brussels Sprouts were fried and caramelized by a fig puree.  The green morsels were served in a large bowl, tossed with grapes, walnuts, and mint.  This fantastic medley was more like a side dish than an appetizer, but enjoyable regardless.  The hummus was smooth, lemony, and addicting.  Traditional Fattoush and Baba Ghannouj salads were well-seasoned and flavorful.  Cone-shaped pitas of Duck Shawarma were stuffed with tender, lean meat; chunks of fig; green onion; garlic; and pomegranate seeds.  This savory, fun dish was the highlight of the meal.When it came to the small-portioned entrees, the satisfying flavors only continued.  Moist Tuna Kebabs were perfectly grilled and seared, plus served with crisp peppers.   The Scallop Siya Dieh included two large diver sea scallops that were also expertly sauteed, offering sweet, caramelized exteriors.  A bed of black squid ink risotto lay below the shellfish, which were sandwiched by crispy onion strands on the opposing side.  The decadent dish was comforting and enjoyable.   Two fantastically seared lamb chops were served medium rare with a Lebanese salsa verde and fire-grilled, herb-roasted tomatoes.My duo of dinner visits to ilili were essentially flawless.  The cool atmosphere and delectable food made this an all-around fantastic spot worthy of 4.5 stars.",2,0,2,Alison C.,"Hoboken, NJ",1125,1410,640

Order a gorgeous and creative cocktail (I liked the mint, cucumber and ginger concoction that instantly cooled me down after a sticky hot sightseeing day). Mingle with the beautifully-turned-out Manhattan crowd before being seated at your candlelit table.Best choices for vegetarians: Hummous (tastiest ever) and roasted eggplant. Four small dishes between 2 of us was too much, but we happen to be light eaters.

4.0,7/11/2010,"Always pass this place but finally decided to grab dinner here...WOW!  Every dish we ordered was amazing.  The decor is really modern and the tall ceilings give it a loft-like feeling.  I like a place that is a step up from casual but not quite jacket-only because I can get a bit more dressy without feeling awkward.  Dim lighting and a very sexy ambiance it would make a nice date spot!To start, our server gave us a small dish of a yogurt dip and spiced crackers it actually tasted a like Fage with oil and spices but it was good.  Then we ordered the warm eggplant - so yummy!  The eggplant was roasted but not overcooked filled with flavor served with scallions and the puffy pita bread.  We asked for more yogurt and our server was reluctant to refill us.  Then we asked to have it again (regardless if we are charged) and he said the portion would be 3x the normal size but then we asked for a small side of hummus and he hooked us up and came back with good sized small portions of each!  For dinner I had the Lamb Kabobs which were about 5 chunks of lamb with cherry tomatoes and a small side salad but by the time we had finished 2 refills of bread I was stuffed.  My friend ordered shrimp which looked great and she loved it.  No room for dessert but they definitely had plenty of choicesWe didn't drink, bill came to $55 - awesome!!  love it.",1,0,0,Kimberly L.,"San Francisco, CA",816,852,812
5.0,7/11/2010,"Where has this place been all my life? For some reason it was just never on my radar and im always looking for some good lebanese food! and this place hits the spot!!! I can not rave enough about how amazing this place is. Not only is the atmosphere great when you walk in but the food is what is the most important here. I was definitely a huge pig for dinner! After looking at the extensive menu of delicious cold and hot meze and entrees, I wanted to order EVERYSINGLE thing! They all looked DELICIOUS!One of the best part of this meal is the endless fresh pita basket. Except i felt extremely guilty when they came by each course and switched out our bread for fresh ones! Even though they told us the bread is only good for the first 5 minutes... i thought it tasted AMAZING still after they were cold! But i love the attention to detail even for their free bread!For the cold meze we gotBaba Ghannouj - delicious! its tough to find good baba ghannouj. I love the texture and the flavor. Kibbeh Nayeh Beirutieh (steak tartar / burghul / onion / mint)- this is awesome totally not what i expected from a steak tartar but it was a GOOD unexpectedness? (is that even a word?) but wow do they not skimp on portions either ! I almost got full on JUSt the steak tartare! sooo goood! Highly recommendedHot MezeWarm Eggplant - This is amazing. The flavors are strong and perfectly cooked. even for egg plant haters this delicious will make you a convertChicken Livers - chicken liver was cooked perfectly! loved the textureDuck Shawarma - this was by far my FAVORITE dish in the house. the presentation was playful and where can you find duck shawarma? What an amazing addition. Since im asian i equate it to a playful lebanese peking duck. it has all the fixtures similar with the bread, duck, and sauce! mmm mmm delicious! I wish they made this into a full course meal as i would probably eat 10 of these! Best part of this dish for me (since im a glutton) is they did NOT skimp on meat! it was literally a mouthful of meat per bite and i was on cloud 9! MUST ORDER!! you will NOT be disappointed Mekanek - the sausages were also delicious! i love the texture and flavor and the bits of pine nuts within the sausage.Main CourseLamb chops - superb extremely juicey and flavorful Mixed Grill (chicken shish taouk / beef kebab / beef kafta) - we ordered this cause we wanted to get a taste of everything and i am so glad i did! the chicken shish taouk was to die for! i believe the chicken rested on a bed of garlic aoili? i may be wrong but whatever the sauce was it was orgasmic!  The chicken was tender and extremely juicey! the kafta was so flavorful and the beef was extremely tender and juicy! This is another great dish to order! loved it!SidesBatata Harra im so glad i didnt have to choose between which side was better cause the batata harra and phoenician fries were amazing. I was introduced to Batata harra at Meze Grill and I add that on top of every combo i create! i knew i had to try it here and i can eat this every day!Phoenician Fries - same with this! i love the dip. i wish they packed it up for me when i got it to go :( they forgot the dip :( DessertTwo desserts which i forgot the name for. Ill hopefully remember itBoth of the desserts were huge! and love the orange infused syrup! One of the dessert was some sort of upside down cheese thingy whatever it was it was awesome! we were too full to eat dessert but they highly recommended it. Glad i didnt decide against it or else i would have missed out on the sweet heavenly delight!all in all best lebanese restaurant in the city hands down and one of my new favorite restaurants in the city. Such a hidden gem that should not be a best kept secret. I wish everyone would go out and try them!

4.0,7/8/2010,"I'll keep it simple instead of writing large, winding reviews...They have large selection of Tapas dishes, they have large proportions so I would be careful in ordering many dishes.  They have Schwarmis or schwarmas, I'm not sure about the name, but they are beef or duck wraps and are very good, but they are pretty large for a tapas dish, so don't go and order two of these!The phoenix fries are good!  I had the lambchop entree, which was good, but nothing spectacular, you're better off ordering the tapas/appetizers menus, ordering a few of those will be as much food  as an entree dish.The beef kibbeh is interesting, but I probably would skip it.  The brussel sprouts are pretty interesting unique too, but I probably wouldn't order it again.I would recommend trying some of the drinks!  They are really good, but expensive and they give you such a small amount!if you haven't been here before, try the Prix fixe menu FIRST!!  The tab can run up pretty fast with all the appetizers!",1,0,0,Johnny C.,"New York, NY",5,73,2

They looked and smelled amazing. I ended up ordering those and the Black Cod. They also paired a great Spanish white wine with my meal. The Black Cod was $19 for half a filet. Not filling by itself but, still very worth it. And yes the Brusselsprouts were delicious as well. They were perfectly caramelized, came with walnuts, white grapes, fig puré, and a bit of cream at the bottom of the bowl. DO yourself a favor and order this combo when you go. I tried some of my friends food and was extremely happy that I ordered the Black Cod. It was probably the best thing on the menu.

4.0,7/5/2010,"ilili had topped my list of restaurants to check out for a while now, based on viral buzz, critical praise, and general curiosity regarding Lebanese cuisine. The girlfriend and I decided to make Saturday date night and reservations were set. I'm happy to say that, for the most part, ilili lives up to its tremendous hype.We figured we'd order a bunch of small plates for dinner, seeing as two full pages of the menu were devoted to them. Baba Ghannouj is typical Middle Eastern crowd-pleasing fare, and I don't go wild over it like some people, but ilili's offering was probably the best I've had. We also had the Beef Fried Kibbeh, an order I could've done without, honestly. They are essentially four golf ball-sized dumplings, but man, are they heavy! Those things sank right to my stomach. The Mekanek was fantastic - a warm plate of smoky, little lamb sausages. But the standouts were the Phoenicians fries - super-salty and super-addictive - and the Duck Shawarma. I loved everything about this last dish - fresh meat, bold figs, just the right amount of green onions, and the signature garlic whip to bring it all home. Next time I find myself at ilili, I'll be sure to try some new dishes, but the fries and the duck stay put. I'm ordering them every time.I have to admit that I do have one gripe, though. While the staff was very attentive and professional, I couldn't help feeling rushed. We were already being taken care of and being checked on rather frequently, so I'm not really sure why the restaurant felt the need to send both our server and the floor manager as a tag team to our table. I think we were ready for dessert after only thirty minutes. I think we spent more time on the subway ride to the Flatiron than we did actually inside ilili. I don't think this was the relaxing dining experience I was hoping for. Delicious, yes, but relaxing, not so much.The micromanaging service here won't get me back anytime soon, but, like I said, the food will, so I'll take it. ilili didn't succeed in showing me tremendous variation between Lebanese food and other Arabic cuisine, but I can't attest to a finer Middle Eastern at-large dining experience. The decor is very modern and geometric, designed with more hard right angles than a NYC street map. The cocktails come with a price tag, but they pack a punch worth the admission to Tipsy Town, especially the From Manhattan To Beirut.Apparently, ""ilili"" means ""tell me"".

The brioche complemented the meat nicely - it was toasted, and the bottom was a little soggy from the lamb. Appetizer was baba ganoush - also on the salty side, and pitas were fluffy but a bit tasteless, and sadly very crusty after they cooled. Pre-fixe for $18, which I'm not convinced is worth it.

Usually end up sharing the mezzes which is an excellent way to try a bunch of thing. the hummus and falfels are pretty addictive. I sometimes hoard the plates and don't share.

5.0,6/22/2010,"My buddy, M, the SO and I went to Ilili on a mission: to find a place that does kibbe nayeh better than M's mom, whose Lebanese dishes are the best in the world, if you want to go by M's version of things. Did we succeed? Thankfully for the sake of familial harmony, we did not -- but we came dangerously close. Ilili does a lovely kibbe nayeh and other dishes, too. All three of us did the evening tasting menu, which amounted to quite a lot of food to share.* Many of the appetizers had an acidic component to them from lemon juice and pomegranate molasses, which actually went extremely well with the more-acidic-than-usual, light, young Louis Latour Burgundy. It's not a wine I'd ordinarily like, but we ordered it at our waitress's suggestion and it was a good recommendation. My favorite mezze, the chicken livers, was a perfect balance of salty, sour (lemon, pomegranate molasses) and sweet (pom molasses, again), with delectably caramelized / crisp edges. Even my liver-hating SO professed love for the dish before I fessed up to what it was. The warm eggplant -- disks thinly sliced from long, narrow eggplants -- was also incredible, again with a nice balance of sweet (tomato, tamarind molasses), salty and sour (tamarind molasses). M loved his kibbe nayeh, though it was a variation we weren't familiar with, made sans allspice and with more heat than M's northern Lebanese mother uses. Other appetizers (listed below) were all competently prepared, but not as noteworthy. Believe it or not, things actually got even better in the next course. My harissa-roasted hamachi main, brilliantly prepared with deep umami flavors, was truly a highlight. It was nicely seared on the outside and perfectly rare, inside and bathed in an incredible butter sauce that perhaps reflects Lebanon's history as a French colony. Alongside the fish were lightly cooked cucumber and grapefruit, both of which added a lovely brightness and welcome contrast to the rich sauce. This was a perfect dish if I've ever had one, perfectly balanced in terms of textures and flavors, and perfectly executed. M's duck kebabs were deliciously rare and fairly straightforward in peparation. The basterma topping my SO's burger transformed an otherwise solid, but not remarkable, lamb burger into something heavenly. The ashta clotted cream was a true-to-form traditional dessert, homey, yet delicate with the addition of orange blossom essence. Lebanese ice cream, which none of us had ever tried, was gummy (chewy) and matched the descriptions I've read of Turkish ice cream. I'm not sure I loved the texture -- the boys adored it -- but the pistachio flavor in ours was concentrated, deep and very rich. Wonderful. The candy bar was nice, but too heavy for me after this meal and I'm very glad that someone else had primary responsibility for it! -------------* Full listing of dishes we tried: Appetizers:- Mekanek (lamb sausage sautéed w/ olive oil lemon, pine nuts)- Warm Eggplant (tomato, tamarind molasses, scallions)- Kibbeh Nayeh Jnubieh (steak tartar, burghul, cumin, marjoram onion, mint)- Fasoulia (cannellini beans, lemon, garlic)- Fattoush (Lebanese garden salad toasted pita, sumac lemon vinaigrette) - Chicken Livers (lemon, pomegranate molasses, sumac)Mains: - Duck Magret Kebab (Magret duck breast, lettuce, garlic whip, spiced pita)- Lamb Burger (basterma, kashkaval, arugula)- Harissa Marinated Hamachi (roasted w/ harissa, cucumber, grapefruit, butter sauce)Desserts: - Pistachio Lebanese ice cream- Ashta (traditional Lebanese clotted cream w/ orange blossom simple syrup, bananas) - Ilili Candy Bar (chocolate kataifi crunch, chocolate ganache pistachio and fig caramel, table side finish w/ warm chocolate sauce)",7,4,8,Jane D.,"New York, NY",102,255,31
5.0,6/16/2010,IDK how I end up spending $50 here on happy hour specials but I did and I'm not complaining. The food- particularly the beef shawarma is to DIE for and my friend was totally jealous of me for ordering it when she just got the ceviche- which was good but not as awesome in flavor and price to my shwarma.

4.0,6/13/2010,"I  had a five star dish, and one of the worst food experiences of the year here - so since our other seven dishes were three to four star level between the two extremes, I'm opting for the 4* rating.  The five star dish was the duck shwarma.  Not because of the duck preparation or flavor, but because of the wonderful citrus-based sweet sauce the wraps were covered in.  Loved that combination of sweet-sour and duck along with the crunch accompaniments.  The good solid dishes - humus, falafel, labne, kibbeh, fattoush salad - all were good, but I've had better at lebanese restaurants.  Nothing to complain about but nothing to rave about.  Which brings me to the disgusting lamb burger.  This may be one of the winners of the most-vile-food-experience award for the year.  I could not even bring the thing close to my mouth, the seared fat in the burger smelled so off.  Flavor was completely absent, as the only thing you could taste was SALT and what tasted like rotted lamb fat.  It was absolutely inedible.  I don't know if it was just this batch of ground lamb, or if its always this bad, but none of us could take another bite after our first.Had I only tasted that item, this place would have had the worst review of the year.  Its a good thing we had other dishes.Waitress was great, ambiance was great.  They were very professional and also removed the lamb burger from the bill when they saw we left it untouched and were not pleased with it - which is why I am giving the place 4* - its solid enough that I'd go back.",1,0,0,Matars Z.,"Rockville, MD",0,79,0

I work nearby and have walked by it numerous times without even noticing the space. Once you step inside though, the spacious room is inviting (though a tad dark). We ordered the prix fixe menu, and were happy with all the dishes. We were suprised to get 2 appetizers each, and still had a difficult time narrowing down the choices. Between me and my dining companion, we got to try 6 different dishes and 2 desserts between us. Everything ranged from very decent (hummus), to tantalizing (clams steamed in harrisa butter). Loved the chicken liver appetizer, seared with a sweet-tart glaze that helped cut the fattiness perfectly. Sweetbreads were a rich little bite contained within a lettuce cup. Entrees were a little less exciting after the flurry of appetizers. The supplemental lamb chop was tender and perfectly done, but the beef kabob was nothing special. Portion size of the entrees were on par with the appetizers; next time, I think I'll ask if I could just have three choices from the appetizer menu instead.Can't wait to come back for the bone marrow!",0,0,0,B Y.,"New York, NY",33,130,0
4.0,6/6/2010,"Oh no, another Tabla I thought, strolling through the doors of Ilili to the dimly lit, swanky lounge area, complete with a full bar, lavish couches and jazzy elevator music from a Carnival cruise. But I couldn't have been more wrong.  Yes, Ilili is all about style - but it retains substance too, quite a bit of it, and manages to update the classic Lebanese cuisine while staying mostly authentic to its Middle Eastern roots.Food: We started off with four mezzas - the Lebanese equivalent of tapas - but before we even had the chance to order, we received a nice-sized plate of labne (strained yogurt) with seasoned zaatar to munch on. The labne, sprinkled with fresh mint and green olives, was fantastic, not an afterthought as is the case with so many complimentary starters at similar establishments. Hommus ($7.50) was standard, good enough to savor with the incredibly pillow-soft bread that arrived with it, but not very complex or robust, only adequate. Instead, order the much tastier baba ghannouj ($9) if you need your dip fix, or better yet, ask for another bowl of the complimentary labne, if you have no shame (I don't). The black iron shrimp (five for $15) were delicious and spicy - very spicy, the jalapeno and cilantro working well with traces of garlic and sweet grape tomatoes to temper the heat. We ordered this on the advice of our server, who mentioned that it pairs flawlessly with the hommus, but I couldn't find the correlation, if only to have the pronounced flavors of the prawns compensate for the bland chickpea blend. Either way, nothing that evening could compete with the Brussels sprouts ($13), which, the server didn't need to tell me, came perfectly paired with a napkin to wipe my lips clean when I was done salivating. These were delicious and hearty, the sweetness of the grapes and fig puree juxtaposing well with the fried, savory sprouts, which were nearly overflowing from the generous-sized bowl. The branzino ($18), flaky and juicy, and grilled in a tahini pepper sauce was fine, but nothing earth-shattering. The portion seemed a bit on the smaller size for a main dish, although the diner who ordered it was definitely not complaining; the fish was gone in a matter of minutes. Lamb chops ($18 for two) also came a la carte, with only two roasted tomatoes and a smattering of field greens embellishing the mostly-white plate. The meat, medium-rare, was juicy and fatty, with the kind of sumptuousness and gamy after-taste that marks a good lamb, but I would order something a bit more multifaceted next time; two lamb chops on a plate doesn't do anything for my eyes, or my appetite.We shared the Phoenician fries ($9), which were oversalted but not overrated. While I may have to consider a daily regimen of Lipitor if I make Ilili a regular dining spot, I absolutely won't think twice about ordering these again; I couldn't discern if they were seasoned with actual sumac or just more salt, but these fries were fantastic. The portion was big enough for at least three people, and the delicious, creamy garlic whip was so good we had to ask for another round. If Bloomberg has his way with his anti-sodium crusade; these will be the first to go, and countless New Yorkers will feel very deprived.The meal ended with a Turkish coffee (excellent; very black and just as strong), which was more like an espresso, and the apple pain perdu ($12), which was severely overpriced for what was essentially a slice of French toast with caramelized apple bits and pine nuts on top, much more like a tarte tatin than a gooey, hearty, bread pudding, the version that I'm more accustomed to. At lease the scoop of coconut sorbet that arrived alongside the brick-like bread was refreshing.    Atmosphere: Ilili has it all in terms of atmosphere; a narrow hallway that opens up to a spacious lobby that welcomes diners into a scene straight out of the Meatpacking District: a sexy bar, comfortable couches and tables to place your florid, overpriced, sugar-laced cocktails on. There is even an upstairs dining room, complete with another bar, for a more private eating experience.Service: Our server offered plenty of advice and recommendations, none of which really helped. At least she was attentive, and pronounced all the dishes correctly.Value: I will be back, but not for the overpriced entrees, at least not the ones from the grill. I'll be returning for the dinner prix fixe (two mezzas, one main dish and a dessert for $38!), offered Sunday-Wednesday, but particularly for the mezza platters, three of which are offered ($52, $59 and $126). Although Ilili has a sizable, diverse menu, its mezzas are definitely its strengths, and its amazing space is conducive for exactly that type of communal, tapa-style eating.",2,1,2,Chris C.,"Jersey City, NJ",101,27,141
5.0,6/1/2010,"This restaurant is like out of a mirage. A meal at ilili is flavorful, exciting, and adventurous.  The decor is ultra modern and sure to impress if you want to take a date or a friend out for dinner and drinks. I love everything but you must must MUST order the ""from Beirut with Passion"" cocktail which is a divine melody of mint infused vodka, cilantro, and passionfruit. Then I suggest going with the vegetarian mezzo platter that comes with hummus, baba ghanoush, falafel, fatoush, lentils with fried onions, stuffed grape leaves, all served with fresh baked pita bread. The Phoenician fries are also hard to pass up. Its wonderful because everyone at your table can share the food, pass it around, and eat a lot of different things without feeling grossly overstuffed. A vegetarian will feel right at home here. Even though they offer meat and fish options, over half the menu is vegan friendly. And did I mention how well prepared and flavorful everything is? For dessert the ilili candy bar is pure chocolate enthrallment. Its so smooth you'll feel like you're biting into a chocolate pillow, with an exciting crunchy bottom layer all topped off with some vibrant green pistachios and fig caramel. A trip to the ilili restroom - where an attendant personally locks you into your ultra modern stall with a sleek sliding door - completes this experience.

They put us upstairs in the private dining area but, per our request for a lively atmosphere, they sat the tables that we were not occupying. We had our own wait staff that was well-groomed, fun and attentive. Don't even get me started on the food. Our 3-course meal was comprised of approximately 15 incredible Mediterranean dishes.

4.0,5/29/2010,"Never in my life have I described any dish as ""orgasmic"" but you should know that I practically came eating ilili's brussels sprouts. There, I said it.A group of us ate here for a friend's birthday and we all were quite satisfied with our dishes. Personally I have a big soft spot for Mediterranean food and was curious to try a Lebanese take on it. It would have been nice to have the $38 prix fixe dinner but it's only available Sunday to Wednesday. We were all happy ordering mezze, which are shareable appetizers, plus entrees. None of us realized that labne, strained yogurt drizzled with olive oil, comes automatically to the table (delish, btw) so in addition we ordered a couple of hummus apps to start and had a nice intro to a fabulous meal.A round of sangria was ordered, and then another. As I don't eat meat, I ordered mouhamara, a puree of walnuts and peppers, which was perfectly spicy, as well as the aforementioned brussels sprouts as my main. I really wasn't kidding about what I mentioned earlier!! They are fried (but not deep fried), drizzled with a dill yogurt and a fig sauce and topped with walnuts. Yummm!! Friends were more than pleased with their lamb kebabs and cod. For dessert there was baklava, surprisingly shareable as they are pre-cut into bite-sized portions, the ilili Candy Bar was good but too rich for me, and the Napoleon-like dessert of crunchy noodles sandwiching the clotted cream was good but too heavy on the noodles.The atmosphere here is sexy and sophisticated; you could take a date or parents. Service was excellent, our waitress was great helping us choose dishes and was nice as well as professional. My only complaints are that though the food was fantastic I truly think it was overpriced. To drive that point home, pitchers of watery sangria turned out to be $45 each! What?? Stick with wine, better.

4.0,5/14/2010,"Where I come from, Lebanese food is available on every second street corner. And no, I'm not from Lebanon. It comes as a surprise that Manhattan doesn't have much Lebanese food. But what it lacks in volume is more than made up by the fact that New York has one the best upmarket Lebanese restaurants I've ever been to. One StarAll the usual dishes, tabouleh, hummus, baba g etc are done very well - nice, fresh, with the right amount of seasoning delivered so it's not overpowering. Pita puffs perfectly prepared. Two StarsAs we had the Mezza Kbire we also had moujadara, kibbeh nayeh, lahmajeen, mekanek, beef fried kibbeh. Try saying this properly and you'll be rewarded with some fine dishes indeed. Try saying it to security at La Guardia and you might get a somewhat different response. And then there are the specialties. If brussel sprouts tasted like this when I was young, I would gladly have eaten more. It completely changed my opinion of brussel sprouts. Like paradigm shifting. Like whoa. Sue Y's review couldn't describe them better. These desserts were very tight too. We had the bread pudding, chocolate cake and candy bar. Three StarsTall ceilings, low lighting, nice atmosphere. Four StarsGood service, although I found it strange that some large security type folks were walking around with ear pieces. The only hotbed of Middle Eastern activity I could see was presumably in their kitchen.(Five Stars)Their Lebanese wine is awful. Fortunately we had the option of sending it back, which we did. I think our waiter got the proverbials from this, especially as he'd recommended it. Deferred to the French on this one.

Browned to bring out the nuttiness, they were mixed with sweet grapes and crunchy walnuts, in an amazing mystery (maybe it was fig?) sauce. Love the layout of the building. Open space. Lovely decor. Great ambiance. Funny bathrooms. They lose a star for trying to cram their patrons in like sardines. Patrons (not just our table) had to stand up to create space so that other people could slide into their tables. Was this supposed to create a sense of bonding between their clients? I actually had a short conversation with the guy across from me (at the other table). It would have been incredibly intimate, if he were a close friend. Also, considering how many dishes they suggest you get, the tables were also incredibly small. Do we look like we're in high school? Why force us to exercising our geometric prowess? But seriously, how are you supposed to fit so many small plates onto a tiny table? Anyways, I digress.

Anyhow, my friend really wanted bone marrow and Ilili had it on their menu,.....it turned out to be ONE OF THE BEST BONE MARROW dishes I have ever had!!! You scoop out the marrow with cutesy little spoons and open a teensy pita-like pocket thing stuff the marrow in and top it off with tabouli with chewy cherries!!! As I bit into the pocket, the marrow would EXPLODE into my mouth and mixing with the tabouli and cherries...was just MAGNIFICENT!!

5.0,4/18/2010,"If I could give 1 million stars to ilili, I would. Out of ALL of the restaurants I've reviewed on Yelp, I have to say that hands down ilili has the best overall food out of all of them. I am just stunned at how UTTERLY AMAZING the food is.We ordered the hummus and bread, lahmajeen (pita topped with lamb), duck shawarma (essentially a wrap with lamb and fig and green onions) and chicken shish taouk. Plus a side order of rice. Everything gets an A+++++ rating but I have to shower some special lovin' on the lahmajeen. Thinly crispy pita with grounded slightly peppery lamb baked on top. Ingenious perfection. The chicken shish taouk came in second due to its extremely well marinated and juicy tender grilled bits of chicken laid on a bed of leaves and a thin pita bread.What made the food so special was the fact that the flavors were multi-dimensional. Nothing was JUST sweet, or spicy, or smokey or even ""tasty."" When you put a spoonful of hummus into your mouth or take a bite of lamb, the way that food tastes changes and grows like exploding fireworks or kaleidoscopes in your mouth as you chew. If I stop my ecstatic contemplation of the food long enough to observe the other diners, I know that they feel the same by the way they turn silent as the food is placed in their mouths and they sit there completely still and absorbed. Then you see their eyes slowly growing bigger and bigger and their head starting to nod with barely contained delight and approval.My theory is that the play of sweet and salty, spicy and tangy, watery and crunchy really captures your taste buds and takes it to the next level. This is how the food at ilili is different from the food at almost any other restaurant - the amount of complexity and diversity and imagination that goes into every morsel of food shows and is rewarded by a plethora of food orgasms. Besides the food, the space itself is simply jaw-dropping. Go to the second floor (the ""quiet"" dining space) and find the bathroom. Then stand before the door of the bathroom and gaze down the clear ceiling-to-floor glass paneling to the bar below and feel like you're in a world-class luxe resort. There is also a sweet lounge-y area tucked away behind billowy curtains on the second floor that I assume are for private events. There are more dining tables, round and square, on the first floor and was buzzing with patrons on a Thursday night.

However, this place is SUPER affordable if you order moderately (even though they encourage you to order a number of mezze's to share - but not in a pushy way). Also, you can tell it's well loved as it's a pretty big space (massive by New York standards) and there were enough people there on a Monday night to make it feel pretty hoppin'.We got the following, all EXCELLENT:1) Complementary yogurt dish with olives and crispy flatbread (think like olive oil and bread at an italian restaurant)2) Three of us shared Moujadara (lentil paste with fried onions) and puffed pita on the site. SO GOOD.3) For our main courses my two friends had branzini (fish) and the scallops which they both loved. I had the Lamb Makloubeh which was EXCELLENT and even though it was under the hot mezzes on the menu, it was bigger than either of their main courses. The dish itself was also so, so great. Not oily at all and tons of flavor not to mention a great combination of cool yogurt and insanely tender, meat. (I'm so full but I honestly may drool as I write this :)).

4.0,2/25/2010,"So, if you read my previous review below you will see that I didn't have the best experience here. What happened after I wrote that review is somewhat shocking. I got a message from one of the managers/owners asking for a few minutes of my time to talk about my visit. After talking, I got a letter in the mail, plus a gift card urging me to please return and give ilili a second chance. This was back in August, and I finally just got the chance to get back last week. I didn't make a reservation but decided I would go to the bar for drinks and some small bites with a friend. The bar has a nice selection of happy hour specials for both food and drink. The bartender was very helpful with suggestions and even though it was busy, he took the time to describe how each dish was prepared and what went into each drink. Pretty impressive for a bartender, not a waiter. The food was good, it didn't blow me away, but the vibe is really sexy and the drinks were potent but not overwhelming. As for what bothered me last time; snooty hostess, long wait despite having a reservation, poor waiter service, etc, they seemed to have improved on all fronts. I'd like to point out more so then the quality of food or drinks, that you gotta hand it to an owner or manager that goes out of their way and follow up with someone who had a less then stellar experience at their establishment. Not just a restaurant or bar, the whole service industry in general is lowering the bar and accepting mediocrity. When did just being satisfactory become acceptable? Anytime a place is ""just ok,"" that isn't good enough. The places that I continue to go to again and again are not just awesome because I like the food, but because I feel good when I eat there. When I walk out the door, I'm happy, and I go on with my day or night in a better mood then when I arrived hungry.

4.0,2/9/2010,"We came to ilili for what we thought was going to be an inexpensive Restaurant Week dinner. Apparently, I missed some fine print somewhere and it turns out that they only serve the RW menu Sunday through Friday. As it was a Saturday, we were out of luck. But, since we were already seated, the menu was so enticing, and the frigid temperature outside was not, we decided to splurge and stay. A wise choice -- yes, the bill was on the higher end, but so was the quality of the delicious food we enjoyed. Our taste buds were first warmed up with a complimentary labneh dip served with house-made pita chips -- this was surprisingly spicy and SO good. As per our waiter's suggestion, we then shared a few small plates instead of ordering entrees: the warm eggplant, the brussel sprouts, fattoush salad, a small chicken shish toauk, and a side of the phoencian fries. Everything was great, but we particularly enjoyed the fattoush (I think this may be one of the best simple salad preparations I've ever had), the brussel sprouts (I know this is the best brussel sprout preparation I've ever had), and the fries (bestness times two; these fries are where it's at!). We took some leftovers home in order to leave room for dessert, and I'm so glad we did! The beignets were superb -- light and fluffy, with a dusting of powdered sugar. The Lebanese ice cream was interesting, and I particularly enjoyed the apricot. A quick note regarding the service and atmosphere -- I've gotta disagree with the common sentiment that the staff here is snooty. From the coat check girl to the hostess to our waiter to the busboy, everyone was all smiles. Our dishes were brought out quickly, but we were not rushed through the meal at all, and our water glasses were consistently refilled with no asking involved. However, this place IS on the dressier side, and you might feel a little weird in sneakers and torn jeans.

4.0,2/1/2010,"3.5 - 4 stars for the service. Our waitress was extremely nice & explained everything really well, like how you're meant to eat certain dishes. She told us our food would be served with a ""flow"", i.e. if an entrée is ready before we're done with the appetizers, it will be brought to the table to keep the meal free-flowing rather than a course by course meal. The low rating is because we said we were going to a show afterwards & specifically said we needed to leave by 9:30pm, but we weren't served dessert until about 9:40pm. Our waitress was amazing when she was with us, but to be honest, most of the time she was MIA & difficult to find.5 stars for the food! My group decided to share everything. You get really generous servings here, & I highly recommend going with friends who don't mind sharing because you really get a much more diverse experience with the food. We came during restaurant week, which is a great deal. I loved their food but am not sure it would've been completely worth the regular prices. You walk in & automatically think trendy, trendy, trendy. They keep the restaurant pretty dark for dinner, a pet peeve of mine since I can't see my food - I'm a visual person.ENTREES- Chicken shish taouk - the chicken was very tender but it was slightly burnt on the outside.- Ilili burger - by far the most popular entrée. The burger was cooked perfectly & was delicious.- Fried skate - incredibly creative dish: you take a piece of endive, scoop up the hummus, some almonds, mandarin, & a piece of skate & it is absolutely delicious. I've never had fish with all these different flavors before & we all loved this.- Beef kebab - the beef was cooked perfectly, so tender & juicy! I wouldn't say much for the pita & peppers though, as the peppers were a little overpowering (though if you REALLY like spicy you'd probably enjoy it), but dang the meat was good.APPETIZERS- Hommus - not much here; literally a plate of hummus with some spices. We probably shouldn't have wasted an appetizer on this.- Fava bean salad - not especially memorable, a soupy plate of beans, served cool.- Kibbeh Nayeh (tartar of beef) - very interesting dish! It felt weird eating raw ground beef, but our server explained we're supposed to mash it flat with your fork, scoop it up with pita bread, & eat with either some onion or pepper. Really unique experience, & you can change the flavor of each bite with the onions/pepper.- Falafel - we couldn't get enough of this - it went fast - as it was so soft & delicious. The sauce that came with it was perfect too.- Steamed clams - I thought this would have some cool exotic spice or flavoring but it was just standard steamed clams. Also, was it just me or were half the clams just empty shells? The sauce was a little creamy for my liking as well - just personal preference.- Warm eggplant - Wow! This was one of the most popular appetizers at our table. There were a lot of ""I didn't know eggplant could taste this good"" comments. They were really well seasoned, a little tangy/salty/sour with just the perfect mixture. The only thing is they weren't that warm, I almost though they were supposed to be served cool until I remembered the name of the dish.- Bone marrow - everyone at my table loved this. You fill these little pita bread pouches first with a little bone marrow, & then you stuff the rest with tabbouleh (cherry - a nice touch).- Veal sweetbreads - delicious! Well seasoned & cooked perfectly.DESSERTS- Homemade Lebanese ice cream (pistachio) - I've tried a LOT of pistachio ice cream, & this is by far the best I've ever had! The texture was so smooth & rich, & the flavor authentic, like you're tasting real pistachios but somehow better.- Achta - I wasn't incredibly impressed with this dessert. It was basically two balls that were some sort of dairy/cream product. The consistency to me felt like butter, so it tasted like flavorless balls of fat to me. When you had it with the banana & syrup (sweet/tart), the flavors mixed really well, but the consistency still weirded me out.- Lebanese beignet - delicious! Very very sweet, if that's what you like. I'd recommend eating this right away, as I waited a while before eating mine & it had cooled & hardened a bit.- Ilili candy bar - if you like heavy, dense, rich chocolate desserts, this is the one for you. There's a crunch layer on the bottom of the candy bar which adds really well to the smooth texture of the chocolate, & it's even more rich dipped in the chocolate sauce on the side.POSITIVES:- Food was delicious, well cooked & seasoned (except for slightly burnt chicken).Excellent variety in the menu.- great portions! Great for sharing.- Waitress was good at explaining the menu & how the restaurant worked/ how to eat certain things.NEGATIVES:- service was slow (despite our specific request to be out of there at a certain time) & our waitress was MIA for a lot of the dinner. I think she was swamped with just way too many tables.",1,0,1,Ziyan C.,"San Francisco, CA",83,2074,9557
3.0,1/31/2010,"Was here for restaurant week with another couple.  Certainly one of the better restaurant week menus because each person gets to choose two small appetizers.  In terms of the appetizers, the sausage is delicious and the babaghnoush has a nice smoky flavor and doesn't use mayo like a lot of places.  The haloumi was nothing special nor was the hummous or bone marrow.  For mains i had the duck kebab which was very tasty given the nice fattiness of the meat and would recommend it given the uniqueness of the dish.  While the main dish is small (only one skewer) the abundance of the appetizers makes up for it.  The food price is very reasonable (alcohol is over priced) and the ambiance is cool, however it does not warrant a second visit.  I would like to add that the lady bartender was unnecessarily rude, as she made a remark to me when I asked her for less ice with my scotch.",0,0,0,Jacob F.,"New York, NY",4,11,1

The peak experience for me was the Bone Marrow dish, a platter of two 4-inch long veal shank bones (like the bones in osso buco, but cut lengthwise rather than horizontally), halved, grilled and presented with tabboulleh with dried cherries and tiny pita pillows. The other outstanding dish, a side dish in fact, was the garlic mousse - a lighter than air foamy preparation. Both Bone Marrow and Garlic Mousse could have been spread on good bread and enjoyed as such with a glass of arak. They were both heavenly.We shared Labne (nicely tart drained yogurt), Kibbeh Naya (out of this world steak tartare made of lamb), Kibbeh bi Liban (beautifully textured fried dumplings), Warak Enab Bil Zeit (good stuffed vine leaves, but not enough sautéed onions), Moujadara (lentils and rice with onion fritters, a bit too fussy), Tabboulleh (wonderfully verdant parsley salad, but not enough olive oil), Lahmajeen (nothing outstanding about those Middle Eastern meat pizzas), Mekanek (perfectly seasoned little lamb sausages), Lamb Makloubet (meltingly delicious) and Chicken Shish Taouk (very tender, indeed).The place is like a loft - extremely high ceilings and tastefully decorated.

3.0,1/28/2010,"I dined here the other night , for Restaurant Week. I'm not sure where to start with this, and how I should even rate. I'll break it up into 3 categories: ambience, food, serviceAmbience:  4 starsYou wouldnt even know the restaurant was here. It looks like a tinted window storefront, and then you walk into this beautifully decorated, warmly lit large restaurant. The decor was great, bathrooms were a bit confusing...it just said restroom, so i walked in and it was stalls. Wasnt sure if i walked into the wrong one, but it  looked like it was sort of unisex.     Food: 3 1/2 stars we were to pick an entree, 2 sides and a dessert. My friend and I  both got the lemon chickn and chose sides to share. We picked the hummus, falafel (because they were out of the potatoes), haloumi and warm eggplant. Most everything was good, the warm eggplant was amazing. It was so flavorful, and made me want more! Chicken was decent, but reminded me of something I could get from a food truck in Astoria (which I frequent). Desserts were good- beignets (which were loukamades- if you are familar with greek food) and the chocolate candy bar brownie. The warm chocolate sauce was dark and rich...yummy way to end the meal. I dont like that they served the sides so far before the chicken came out, but I guess its sort of tapas-style, which is what our server told us...which leads me to the next point.Service-  2 starsokay, I'm not sure if our server was new, or on drugs, or just not bright, but she was probably one of the strangest people I've come in contact with. Although very friendly (i'm trying to not be too harsh), I asked her what Skate was (i knew it was a fish of some sort) and she said um, uh, um, ok, how should i say this, its a fish, obviously (which is not obvious) and then she closed her eyes, stuttered for about 45 seconds, looked like she was going to cry, and then said she didnt want to say it the wrong way, without it coming out bad, opened her eyes, closed them again, and then said she needed to find out. It was literally uncomfortable to watch. She came back and said my coworkers told me its the wing of the ray.  Didnt sound too hard to say, did it? So i just assumed she didnt know. She did several weird things like that throughout the dinner. I asked for suggestions, she suggested a lamb dish, told her we didnt eat lamb, and then she suggested ANOTHER lamb dish. Hrm..still dont eat it. She practically cleared my friends plate, while she was putting her fork in her mouth . I'll give her the benefit and say that she had an off night (i had been a server at one point- so i understand) but if i ever dine here again, I'll be sure to suggest a different section. Busboys were VERY efficient in refilling our waters, but our wine took about 10 minutes to get to us, after ordering it.      So, overall i'll give it 3 stars...",0,1,0,Jenn T.,"New York, NY",16,50,0
2.0,1/27/2010,I walk by this place daily so I was excited to finally try it. meh. what a disappointment.The food is below average Lebanese - it does not have the flavor or complexity I expect in this cuisine. The hummus had way too much tahini and thus was bitter. The pita seemed like it came straight from a grocery store. The lahmahjun spices were off. I did enjoy my lamb chops and my husband enjoyed his fish but they were not standout dishes and were not worth the $7 suppliment to the prix fixe menu. Maybe this lackluster experience was due to it being restaurant week? or perhaps the fact that we had just had AMAZING Lebanese food in Detroit that blew this overpriced tasteless meal out of the water?

4.0,1/24/2010,"One thing I can say I'm well versed in is Middle Eastern food, especially of the Lebanese variety. So, I approach every dining experience concerning these sorts of food with great caution.Environment: Very nice. I had made a reservation and we were seated promptly. The interior is modern and the ambiance is warm, although it's spacious inside so it's not cozy.Wait staff: Professional and attentive. I was *very* happy that the wait staff did not annoyingly approach our table to constantly ask how our meal was. Some people may enjoy that but besides the one or two requisite times they ask, I prefer not to be bothered while eating. Food:Mouamarra - tasty but not spicy enough. Also, it was somewhat dry. It could have used more olive oil. Baba ghanouj/Moutabal - tasty but a little too acidic. I could slightly taste the fire-roasted flavor but it was very subtle and I think they added to much citrus or tahini. Labne - this was standard but very good. Appropriately sprinkled with olive oil.Arak - al-Massaya arak tasted as expected but I think they could have spared a little more in the mini-carafe that they brought it in.Duck Shawerma - PHENOMENAL. Shawerma is one of those things that has its classic varieties (veal, beef, or chicken) so I was skeptical but very curious and I figured, when else would I have the chance to try duck shawerma? It was great. The meat was nicely cooked, to about medium but crisp on the outside. It was wrapped in flatbread (not pita) and laden with lettuce, a green tahini sauce, and pomegranates. The taste was incredible. Considering all of the above, I give the place a 3.5. BUT, there is one caveat.Portions: I'm giving this place a four only because of the portions (great as the duck shawerma was). Typically, when Mediterranean or Middle Eastern-oriented restaurants go upscale, they skimp on the portions that make it so pleasant to have a Mediterranean or Middle Eastern meal. Although the prices may preclude you from ordering a table full of mezzes and food, a la traditional family-style dining, the portions of the appetizers and main course will likely leave you satisfied if you're not totally starving.Definitely a place to try out and certainly a place I'd return to just to have that duck shawerma one more time.",1,1,1,Pilisopa B.,"New York, NY",1,18,0

The lamb was extremely flavorful, the hoagie was soft but firm enough for the dipping sauce, and the sauce itself was scrumptious! I also tried the lamb w/ fried eggplant sandwich and enjoyed that as well, but between the two I enjoyed the first much more. The waiter was attentive, friendly & helpful. He gave good suggestions and was quick to fill water glasses and check up on our table. But overall it seems to be one of those places where that is fairly standard.The atmosphere is amazing.

What I had my heart set on was to try their Duck Sharwama, but was told that they don't serve the dish on Sundays. Of those eight dishes we tried, I honestly wasn't impressed with ANY one of them, but thought the Bone Marrow was pleasantly interesting. Now, about their service....The waiter came around to fill our glasses with water and when he got to me, he kept on filling my glass and didn't realize my water was overflowing. Then, our plates were full of hommus after the appetizers and when our ""entrees"" came, nobody came to change our plates. When asked for that, the waiter reluctantly brought clean plates and he accidently kicked me when passing by. And when comes to check time, it only took about 20 mins for them to give us the change.

3.0,1/3/2010,"Okay, truly mixed feelings about ilili. I think I've been planning to come to this restaurant for at least 6 months now. We decided to try it out on New Years eve with another couple.I think ilili has been sippin' off the douchebag draank at 235th because there were some pretentious moments that just shouldn't be at a Lebanese restaurant. Firstly starting with the blatantly false advertising on the website. We booked 7:45pm reservations which bumped us up into the $75 prix fixe menu. Website had promises of belly dancer, DJ, and complimentary champagne but didn't specify this was only for the 9:30pm to Midnight reservations. When I pointed this out I was not greeted with any explanation.The food was very good, some dishes standing out particularly better than others. The lamb sausage was delectable as was the cauliflower and the eggplant appetizers. The duck egg was delicious but way too heavy to the point where I felt the oil content of the dish overwhelmed it. As an entree I was the only of my party to order the pulled lamb while everyone else got the beef kebab. Bad choice on my part. The pulled lamb was very dry. The beef kebab, however was delicious. Desert was the beignets in an orange dipping glaze. Awesomely good. I tried the candy bar too and for a chocolate dish, very yummy.The drinks here were also of note. The fresh meadow and from Beiruit with Passion was nice. Service was okay. Atmosphere was great--very beautifully decorated and maintained.

5.0,12/28/2009,"This was probably my favorite restaurant I visited on my recent weekend trip to NYC. Our server recommended ordering 3 dishes apiece to share between the two of us. In a normal tapas restaurant, this is about the right amount since the serving sizes are usually pretty small.  However, at ilili, I think this was a bit on the heavy side - 4 dishes would have been the perfect amount, whereas 6 dishes stuffed us to the brim. But it was all so good that we continued to eat to the point of misery anyway! The Lebanese white wine we ordered was just OK...a little more sweet than I would have liked, more like a dessert wine. Maybe the server should have filled us in about the different types of Lebanese wine since it's not a common offering at most restaurants.  But since we had never tried Lebanese wine before, it was something new and different, which is always fun. On to the main attraction - the food! Oh. So. Delicious. Here are my 3 favorite dishes: 1. Duck Shawarma - this was just outstanding. Tender duck meat with a light but flavorful sauce wrapped in soft, fresh pita and topped with pomegranate arils (yes, I looked it up on wikipedia to find out what they are called, rather than just calling them little juice filled seed thingys) 2. Chicken Shish Taouk - perfectly seasoned grilled chicken atop a piece of pita covered in a tzatziki-type sauce...so perfect! 3. Warm Eggplant - now, I do not even like eggplant in most dishes, and this was JUST a dish of eggplant....and I absolutely loved it. I have no idea how they seasoned their eggplant, but it was fabulous. This place seemed pretty large for a restaurant in NYC. It was 2-stories with tons of seating on both floors and what looked like a big bar and lounge area near the entry. It is dark and loud and tries to appear pretty trendy, but not overly pretentious (I live in Dallas, so I do immediately recognize pretentiousness!) Pretty pricey, but really not outlandish when you consider what you'd spend on several dishes and a bottle of wine at most tapas-style restaurants. Plus, most of the plates we got were WAY larger portions than your average tapas-style plate. I totally recommend it to anyone - especially people visiting from cities where you get the same old boring stuff over and over...this is definitely something different and worth every penny!",0,0,2,Jill P.,"Dallas, TX",68,94,1

Duck shawarma -- Wow.  Just get it.  They are served in these adorable plastic ice cream holders.  The ratio of meat to bread is perfect, and they're folded so well that they don't fall apart when you eat them.Chicken shish kebab -- Tender, juicy, exactly how chicken should be (and usually never is).

4.0,9/13/2009,"What means if your best memories of a restaurant is the service and its not because the food is not good. Lord, I swear is not because of that ...  However, the most remarkable of my experience at ILiLi was the pre-dinner scenario when I organized a birthday celebration with my friends. 15 pple and if ILiLi would have to Yelp us, we'd probably receive a 2 star rate as much. So many changes, indecision, last minute cancellations.... Still love my friends, tho ~~The main problem was to accommodate 15 instead the original 8. For parties bigger than 10, you will need to order the menu in advance. I highly recommend avoid complications and go with the dinner prix-fixed menu. $35, which includes 2 mezze (appetizers) among a large selection, and a main course among what I find quite short but well studied to satisfied all the tastes. Tables can accommodate 8 people max. However, I asked that we all was seated together and so WE decided to rearrange 2 round tables adjacent each other. Still we had 2 separate groups because the round tables, but they did the effort and I remark ""the WE"" because it was me who went there an studied the dinner room and the options and so I decided with the manager which was the best to do. They also helped me with the menu selection. ILiLi is fancy, chic, fine dinning type. I suggest you dress up. I love the deco and the Lounge area is so nice; perfect for a drink and grab some food in a ""casual"" dinner. Food is Lebanese-Mediterranean, very similar to Greek with some influences of Turkish and Persian. And is really good at ILiLi; fresh, well cooked an authentic. Good, but not cheap and don't expect something creative or ended up so full that you can't eat a bite more. But no worries, you don't need to look for a close McDonald or go to Ktown afterwards. Add to the recipe the ambiance, the deco, and you know, the service, and so the price is worth it. With 2 mezze/person and 15 people.. just make numbers .. we could try almost all the appetizers. Size is quite big; not the same with the main dish. So I'd recommend 1-2 appetizers to share, depending you food avidity, and 1 main dish/person. Besides the Kibbeh Nayeh  (tartar of beef / burghul / onion mint) that wasn't good in my opinion because the raw beef was like a paste, I loved the Grape leaves and the Hummus and the Ilili wings was also a winner.The rest of the appetizers was really good also.  As well as the main dishes. I order Sidon Black Cod and it was really good, grilled with olive oil, you can't deny the Mediterranean character on it. Very fresh and tender, melting in your mouth. For dessert I chose the ILILI CANDY BAR... pure chocolate.. [sigh]. They wine menu is really good. I'd choose a Lebanese or Greek considering the food,  but they also offer wines from France, Spain Italy and USA.. and based in my Spanish wines knowledge is a good selection.  We choose a Lebanon white wine which was close to Greek whites; light, fruity and easy to drink. The whole experience cost us $65 each. Friend's Bday celebration, private party kind. Can't complain. I'd definitely come back, next time with the regular dinner menu which is very interesting offering a wide selection of dishes not available in the prix-fixed, I have already a waiting list of dishes to try... and 14 people to share with, but not all together this time.. lol, although I know I could at ILiLi.",4,3,5,Laura A.,"Brooklyn, NY",232,344,1232

3.0,8/22/2009,"My friends had heard good things about ilili, so we decided to make it our Restaurant Week destination.  I had never eaten Lebanese cuisine prior to this outing, so I was excited.  I read many reviews on Yelp about ilili, and it seemed as if it could be a really swanky and potentially pretentious restaurant.  Yes, the hostesses are quite tall, leggy, and gazelle-like, but other than that, the space felt really casual, open and modern.  The mirrors were a bit weird to have all around, but hey I guess folks need to check on their hair every few minutes.  After taking a peek at the a la carte options, we immediately cracked open the RW menu.  Our waitress was really great, and attentive throughout the evening.  For our ""small"" plates (2 per diner), we ordered hummus, baba ghannouj, fattoush, lahmajeen, mekanek, arak mussels, warm eggplant, and veal sweetbreads.  I say ""small"" because the portions were quite generous.  I enjoyed the sweetbreads, although you couldn't really taste them because of the excess breading.  The eggplant was also a good choice.  I personally have never been a fan of any lamb dishes, but I tried them out anyway.  I still don't like lamb.  The hummus and baba ghannouj were both okay, but nothing spectacular.  I have had better at smaller, hole-in-the-wall places.For our entrees, we ordered the ilili burger, wild stripped bass, and chicken shish taouk.  I was happy with my entree, the bass, mostly because I can't stand lamb, and didn't want to go entirely vegetarian.  My friends couldn't finish their burgers, which were kind of big.  I pretty much was able to finish my fish, which had some good flavors.  The vegetables were a bit of disappointment though.And to cap off the evening, we had some desserts - achta and candy bar.  I don't think their desserts were that good.  In fact, I barely touched my candy bar, because I was very full and not that into the overwhelming sweetness.  The achta was definitely flowery and I am glad I did not order it.  I would have skipped dessert if it had not been part of the RW prix-fixe.Anyway, ilili is worthy of a first visit, but I'm not sure if I would go back.  There are plenty of other restaurants (probably not Lebanese though) in New York to try out.  However, I must say that the restrooms were truly something out of this world.  Not your traditional boring stall, but a complete experience, with a sliding door and a beautiful sink.",1,1,0,Julia Y.,"Manhattan, NY",28,70,25
4.0,8/20/2009,"I came here for Restaurant Week w/ a close friend of mine.  I had heard that their burger was divine so I wanted to prove or disprove.  lol  What an asinine thing to say.  Anyway, you get a choice of two small plates, an entree, and dessert.We decided to share our small plates just so we could try a little bit of everything.  And we definitely got to sample the Lebanese fare.  We had the mussels, hummus, beef tartar, and fries w garlic sauce.  I don't know why I didn't connect the word tartar with raw.  Sometimes my brain goes haywire and I think the birds will come out to sing.  But yes, the beef was raw and since I was in an adventurous mood, I tried it.  Once I got past the ""oh snap, this isn't cooked yet- will I die of Mad Cow disease?"" psych-out, it didn't taste bad.As a warning, the 2 appetizers were already enough to fill us both up.  But foodies eat with their eyes, and not with their brains, damnit!  Alas, came the main event of the burger, which was a mix of lamb and beef patty.  It made it to my top burgers list, but fell short of the one I had in Pike Market, Seattle.Dessert was where their shortcomings showed.  My friend got donut holes- whatever fancy schmancy name they gave became irrelevant when we saw what it was.  And I got Lebanese pudding- it tasted like flowers.  Don't ask how I would know what a flower would taste like- if you tried it, you would know too.  lol  but as the minutes went by, I began to enjoy my floral sweetness.Still, overall, the food was above average, and I'm rounding up a bit from 3 and 1/2 stars bc it was a particularly enjoyable dinner.  Service= meh.  We asked for a picture and he never returned to take one for us.",1,0,2,Jenn F.,"Brooklyn, NY",767,372,2548
4.0,8/17/2009,"My husband and I ate here to celebrate our anniversary. We heard good things from friends and decided to try something different from our usual Italian or seafood ""celebration"" restaurants. The hostess first sat us at a very small table that was very close to two other two-tops. She had no problem moving us when we asked for a nicer table. We chose to do the prix-fixe for $35. I thought it was a great deal, the appetizers were huge and delicious. Some of the spices were a little too heavy for me but for the most part, I enjoyed the dishes. The entrees were small but amazing and we were already almost full from the appetizers. I didn't really enjoy the desserts, the apricot ice cream was too rich and I thought the orange blossom simple syrup tasted a little too much like perfume. All in all it was an enjoyable evening, I would definitely go back.",0,0,0,Rachel P.,"Queens, NY",2,17,0
5.0,8/4/2009,"OMG. Where to start. I had such a fantastic meal here. My sisters and I took my younger cousins here during Restaurant Week- i.e., the only week of the year when we could afford to take them out to a nice place. We were so, so pleased. First, the cocktails. We sat next to the bar while we waited for our table and were able to try a few drinks. I had the ""From Beirut With Passion,"" which was insanely good, and I think my sisters had the Phoenician Lemonade, which was also really tasty. I may have also had the St. Germain Cocktail. Scary that I can't quite remember, but whatever. By the time I walked out of that place, I was in a food coma that copious amounts of booze did not help to dispel. Aaaanyway. What made the drinks even tastier was that during happy hour (M-F, 5:30-7:30), their specialty drinks are only $6! Vhat a deal. I don't know how much they are normally, but they'd go for at least $10 at other places.In terms of the RW menu, Ilili did it right. The items were off of their regular menu, which is so much better than when restaurants make up bullshit cheapo RW menus. And the amount of food we got was RIDICULOUS. Seriously, we're big eaters, but this meal could have fed ten people. First, they delivered a lovely little amuse bouche (labne- a really yummy yogurt dip with pita slices). They were also doing a wine tasting that week, so we each had a little taste of a Lebanese wine. Nice touch. Then, for dinner, we each chose two appetizers, one entree, and dessert. Two appetizers! And these were no foo-foo apps either. They were the real deal, full-size. We pretty much tried everything on the menu between the five of us, but the highlights were: the seared haloumi, the kibbeh nayeh (steak tartare), warm eggplant, chicken shish taouk, vegetarian fatte, and the Ilili candy bar. But seriously, I think I would have been happy with anything off of the menu. Everything was so delicious, and I loved that I had never had many of the things we ordered (I've only had Lebanese once before, but it was gooooood.)The service was incredible. Normally, if a server saw five young girls (two still in their teens) come in for restaurant week, she'd probably be kind of pissed. Not this one. From the first minute, she was incredibly friendly, informative, and patient with all of our requests and questions. Even the food runner was amazing. He showed us how exactly to eat any unfamiliar dishes and recommended some Lebanese liquor to wash it all down (it's called arak- it was verrrrry licorice-y, which we didn't love, but it was part of the whole Lebanese experience, so whatev). There's so much more I could say, but my advice is: GO HERE. TONIGHT. THIS WEEKEND. BEFORE YOU DIE. I'll definitely be back. Even if it's just for the happy hour.",2,0,2,Emily A.,"Richmond, CA",61,156,0

3.0,7/31/2009,"I came here for restaurant week with some friends hoping to have good Lebanese food for the first time.  Our server was really friendly, but took a very long time to bring out our food.  Our dining experience took a total of 2 1/2 hours just to give you an idea of how slow they were. We were given the choices of eating off the restaurant week menu only or the regular menu for everyone in our party.  There was no mixing from the two menus allowed. So here is what we ended up getting:Sides - We started off with these and the portions were so big that we were nearly full by the time our Main Plates came out.1) Chankleech Crumbled feta cheese on onions, tomatoes, and zaatar.  Eat it with the pita bread (which are HUGE by the way). This was an okay compared to the other sides we got.2) Arak MusselsThese were small mussels in a garlic sauce.  Very good. 3) Warm EgglantMy friends liked these the most.  They're small slices of eggplant with tomatoes, tamarind molasses, and scallions.  Pretty good, but definitely not my favorite side.4) Phoenician FriesI decided to indulge myself with some starchy fries. It's got a garlic taste with salt and pepper on it.  My favorite side. I ate so much of these that I could barely touch my main plate later on.5) Bone MarrowThe bones come out sliced down the middle so it'd exposed the marrow and be easier to eat.  It's topped with spices and comes with tabbouleh and these small ""pita pillows"" that you can stuff the it into. It's not much, but I liked this dish. 6) MekanekLamb sausages.  I read from a fellow yelper that these were delicious so I decided to get it.  The spices in the sausages overpowered the lamb taste.. in fact, it was so strong that I couldn't even tell there was lamb meat in it at all. Main Plates - Our main plates weren't as great as the sides.  1) Wild Stripped BassIt comes with grilled veggies, olives, and some salsa verde.  Nothing too spectacular or flavorful. I'd probably try something else for the next visit here.2) Vegetarian FatteThis was an interesting entree. It looked like a soup made of yogurt with chickpeas at the bottom.  There's pita chips that comes with it, also. It was VERY creamy so I could only eat it with the pita chips lightly dipped into it. It's definitely not like eating a regular soup.  Desserts - Well by this time, our stomachs were about to explode so we opted for some Lebanese ice cream in two flavors:1) Pistachio Okay, I didn't quite understand how a fellow yelper could say something tasted like soap, but now I do.  Wow, this flavor really did taste like soap and I think it's due to the strong floral taste to it. I would not recommend getting this. 2) Apricot I didn't get a chance to taste this but my friends did and they liked it much more than the pistachio. A bit of a side note: When our ice cream scoops came out, the apricot scoops were halfway melted and our friend told the waiter about it. To our dismay he had the audicity to ask us if we wanted him to bring out a new one.  His correct response should have included an apology and he should have told us he'll bring out a new one instead of asking. After being disgusted with our pistachio ice cream, we sat there for another 10 minutes or so waiting for our waiter to come back with the bill.  By then we noticed that our pistachio ice cream had melted halfway, which means our original apricot ice cream order had been sitting out for 10 minutes before arriving to our table.  How ridiculous is that?I will probably come back again to try the kebabs.  Overall, it was a decent place, but nothing spectacular.",0,0,0,Kim L.,"New York, NY",299,68,3

Came here for a work dinner with several people so we had our server bring an assortment of appetizers, entrees, a little of everything. One of the standouts for me was the Lebanese wine selection. At one point during the meal I was fearful that our dinner organizer (a passionate wine aficionado) was going wine crazy. The glass I was sipping was so excellent I was certain we were downing something very expensive, but to my surprise it was a very reasonable $60 bottle.

3.0,5/12/2009,"I had been here for a company happy hour and was quite impressed with the atmosphere as well as the look and feel of the place. The drinks were well made and the couple of appetizers I managed to snag were tasty. I decided to try this place for dinner one night. So fast forward a year later and you have my friend and I deciding we should give this place a try because they currently have a prix fixe menu of $35 for one main course, two sides and dessert. So we went on a Wednesday night at 7 pm and gave it a whirl. They have a good happy hour menu and drink list that ends at 7:30 so if you can exit work early and get here, you are in luck. We were seated right away and immediately began looking at the menu. We also made sure to divide up the sides so that there were four different kinds to try. Choices and comments are as follows: Appetizer: Free pita chips that were very crunchy and served with a yogurt blend and olives. A lovely start to the meal. Sides: * Warm eggplant - even if you don't like eggplant I have to think you'll enjoy this it was so good * Falafel - quite bland and I would not suggest ordering * Lahmajeen - to be honest can't remember this one so can't give you a good comment either way * Chankleech - very good mixture of tomatoes, onions and cheese that went very well with pita bread Main Dishes: * Black cod - small portion that was cooked to perfection but I didn't enjoy the tahini tajen that came with it. I think it ruined the taste of the fish. * Dorade - not my favorite, too many bones and I didn't find the fish had a great flavor to it Dessert: (by this point we are so full but the show must go on) * ilili candy bar - yummy chocolate dessert * Homemade Lebanese ice cream (pistachio) - very creamy but there was something about the flavor that was off. I can't put my finger on it but it almost didn't taste like pistachio at all! So a great night and meal that lived up to my expectations.

The server tried to get us to order more food than we needed. For two women, 1 appetizer, and 2 entrees was more than enough. We actually didn't finish the appetizer.We shared a starter of brussel sprouts, which were pretty good, and I got the lamb makloubeh. The lamb was very tender and good. The eggplant in it was okay and the rice was sitting in enough salty sauce that I needed the cucumber yogurt to off-set it. It was generally good for $16, but I'd order something else next time.The things that weren't so great were $12 for two mint teas (we didn't know the price when we ordered it) and awful tasting baklava.

5.0,5/3/2009,"Ilili was my first experience with Lebanese cuisine, although I am familiar with the Mediterranean palate, which I enjoy.  It is a beautiful upscale restaurant and really quite an interesting space.  There is almost an ""Asian Tea house"" sort of vibe, with high ceilings, and rooms divided by wooden panels with semi-opaque screens.  We were well taken care of at the bar and our table with friendly and attentive waitstaff.All the dishes are tapas/small plate style, meant to be shared.  I came with a party of 4 and we started with the Mezza Petit, a sampler of several of the tapas, which included some traditional favorites such as hommus and baba ghannouj, but also had some more traditional choices, like the Mekanek (lamb sausage sauteed with olive oil and lemon,) which I wouldn't have necessarily chosen, but really enjoyed.Other favorites from the night included the Lamb Kabobs, which were perfectly spiced and tender, the Duck Shawarma, a sandwich of sorts with a great flavor, served in a cone holder, and the Kibbeh Bi Labon, which were beef dumplings (almost like meatballs) cooked in a yogurt sauce.We shared one dessert, the Essmalieh.  This is such an interesting dessert. It is two layers of Kataifi, which is a ""nest-like"" sweet crispy dessert food. In between the Kataifi is Achta, a traditional Lebanese dessert, sort of a sweet Ricotta cheese in taste and texture.  This dessert was crunchy and sweet, but not too much.  It was quite different from anything I've seen and was yummy.I really enjoyed my dinner at Ilili and have a new appreciation for Lebanese cuisine.  I would like to return to Ilili and try the many other dishes to choose from.",8,3,5,Gretchen W.,"New York, NY",40,121,7

3.0,4/12/2009,"A few of us took my friend here for dinner last night and I have mixed reactions about this place. I think it mostly fell short of my expectations. First off, the place is gorgeous. I love the high ceilings with the length of the space. It makes it feel like a mile long. The wood decor was tastefully done and gave it a really earthy vibe. I was reallly disappointed with the food and the service. Our server seemed a bit inexperienced and lacked adequate communication skills. She wasn't very helpful with the menu and seemed a bit pushy on what to order. When we didn't seem to like her suggestions, she seemed a bit annoyed. But I can't help it if there are certain things that we just don't eat. She was there in the beginning a lot, but towards the end of the night she was MIA a lot. So apparently everything is pretty much tapas style portions meant to be shared. She suggested getting 2-3 things per person, which for 5 people would come out to 10-15 dishes. It seemed a bit excessive, but she insisted that the portions were small so we wanted to stay on the safe side. We ended up with 12 dishes. The portions were not as small as she suggested. We couldn't fit it all on the table and there were quite a few things we didn't finish off so I felt pretty wasteful. I was really looking forward to some good hummus, which this place does not do well. But the warm eggplant, the fattoush (lebanese salad), the scallops, were some of the better ones we had that night. For dessert we got their signature, the chocolate candy bar (or something like that) and the homemade sorbet. Both were really good, especially the candy bar. I really enjoyed that very much. I also have to mention that the drinks were pretty weird. None of us were particularly happy with our drinks. One of the girls ordered the not so bloody mary and I don't even know how to explain what that tasted like. She wounded up getting something else, and they were nice enough to take it off the bill since they noticed that she only took 2 sips of it.So this place gets points from me for decor and location. But I take points off for not so tasty food and so-so service.

4.0,4/5/2009,"Our Friend Lili's Birthday Dinner last night at ilili. How can you find more prefect place for her? Dark and very woody deco was quite comfortable. Since we were a big group (15 ppl), we had prix-fixe menu $35 per person. The appetizers, mostly those usual hummus and other dips. We tried almost all appetizers in the menu. Dips are definitley tastefully done, more fine spread and subtle flavoring. I wasn't so crazy about falafel, chicken wings or beef tartar - they seem a bit too blend and usual to me.However, main course Sidon Black Cod that I had was so good. The Cod was so tender and moist melting in my mouth, and everyone raved about it. Other entres were great and everyone really finished all. The portion was just right after filling appetizers. The dessert, I had this Lebanese icecream and no one had any idea what this was made of? My Vanilla ice cream was almost tasted like soap (i think bc of some sweet herbs) with gooey texture. Not that it was bad but it was strange. Majority had chocolate candy bar and that was quite good. It is like a little caramel piece covered with milk chocolate. Overall, the service was really spot on - almost too attentive sometimes. We almost thought that this waiter had a crush on one of our girls.. LOL Only throw back was all the tables are round and they put two big tables together for us which made hard to talk to the other table and we had to move around to talk. I guess it is designed for intimate sharing but, i see a lot of other big table as us sitting weird as well. And it was a bit too dark to see food.  Other than that, it was elegantly done for this type of cuisine which my usual experience elsewhere was more casual and not refined. With Wines, bill was $65 per person. Mature crowd in dining area but, there is a separate cool bar and lounge area so it could be a great casual lounging with appetizers and drinks.

3.0,3/18/2009,"After writing my last review I was contacted by the manager of ilili, who apologized for never sending me a certificate. I received the certificate some weeks ago, and went back this past weekend with my roommate and brother. So as to not seem a ""bought woman"" I tried to be very contemplative before writing my update-This time my server was very friendly. My party and I had a Broadway show to dash to and he was 10 steps ahead of me in terms of making sure we could enjoy our food at a good pace and make it out on time.Even though my last visit left me sick from the food, I remember the food being tastier. I tried the eggplant during my first visit and remember it being amazing, it was good this time, but nothing to come back for. My grape leaves were very very good and my brother really enjoyed his falafel but said it was a bit overcooked. He also thought his lamb kebab was cooked and seasoned perfectly. I had the tuna kebab and asked for it to be almost rare, it was very cooked. I like tuna to be tuna-y if I am going to eat it, so this was a strike. The hummus and tabouli were highlights, as was the pita to start, however my roommate got sick after eating here and she is not lactose intolerant so I am not sure what went wrong. Also, the dessert my brother and roommate ordered tasted like lavender soap. So here are my conclusions. It is a high end spot to eat good Lebanese food. There are not many options for great Lebanese food in this city, so this is a great spot if you want Mediterranean food. The drinks here are really very good and a few of the dishes on the menu are stand outs. I would come here with friends, especially because the restaurant week menu is still in effect and is very very generous, but I wouldn't call ilili a gem in Manhattan's culinary crown.",0,0,0,Emily R.,"West Hollywood, CA",33,74,5
3.0,3/17/2009,"Having lived in west Africa, I really learned to love Lebanese food.  (Many of the business owners there are Lebanese).   But the food is not commonly found in the US.  Bombing Marines barracks probably did not help matters much.  It's a shame because the food is really good.  But usually there isn't much attention given to presentation, and the flavors are not especially complex, so it ends up making for great comfort food.  But illili is the first restaurant that I ever been to that actually tries to present Middle Eastern food in an upscale way.  On the execution, I think they largely succeeded.I began with the complimentary dadne.  It was very simple and nicely done.  The oil was of good quality, and the selection and taste of the olives were good.  The chips looked like they were made in-house as well.  Good start.For the appetizer, I had the hummus ($7).  The accompanying pita was served piping hot, and it was very airy and delicious.  The hummus was nice, but it did not have a distinct flavor that I would have preferred.  Hummus should be bolder.For the entree, I opted for the rouget.  This was elegantly presented with the fish head and attached skeleton dividing the bowl of sauce and the 4 ""fish sticks"".  The fish, while fried, was just delicious, and all of the original flavor was -- amazingly -- preserved.  This was very nicely handled, and the sauce was delicious and fitting.  My complaint though would be that the 4 samples of fish hardly amounted to a full entree.  This is really more of a tapas dish.  At $17, I would have preferred more protein content.  Decor:  dark, elegant, seemingly upscale, though the fractal pattern in the wood did not vary enough to be consistently interesting.Service:  not so good.  I had a gruff waiter who was otherwise indifferent to my table.  Other quirks:  $8/bottle for water -- really?  I should have just had a beer which was only $7.   Lovely, elegant food, but not very filling and not very good service equals 3.5 stars.  The food was great, but everything together, there wasn't enough to want me to go back right away.",5,3,3,Jim U.,"Washington, DC",690,1303,3044

3.0,2/14/2009,"With the extended RW, I took advantage of this opportunity to try out this Lebanese restaurant that I've always wanted to try since it opened because I was once obssessed with Middle Eastern foods.  It was also my friend's birthday and what better way to celebrate without tearing my hair out thinking of what to buy for her at the mall? Yes, 21st century people have lost the creativity of present making.  Anyway, I was surprised that if one orders from the RW menu, then all the other parties have to do so, but the waiter was nice enough that I order something that's 'almost' of equivalent prices, then he could overlook it.  Well, I got the ""large' shrimp salad and when they say 'large', it's really 'small'.  The salad came with bits of shreaded romaine lettuce, a quarter of a sliced avocado and 5 tiny shrimps on a skewer.  The only cutting edge to this dish is the sprinkling pomegrante seeds and roughly chopped dried figs and like 3 sad looking madarin wedges.  It was not worth the $15 tag.  The RW lunch price was decent I think.  You get to choose two sides, a sandwich/wrap and a dessert.  Not bad.  I liked the tabbouleh.  I was going to go for the hummus, but I thought I could get better ones at my go-to restaurant.  Sometimes a hole in the wall places make more authentic flavors.  The lamb tenderloin wrap was good according to my friend.  She ordered the chocolate bar.  I was expecting a better presentation, but it was just a dense piece of chocolate chocolate sweet with chocolate sauce poured on top.  it's quite sweet.  If you're a chocoholic, you'd like it, if not, it might be a bit too much.  The service was attentive.  Would I return? Probably not. I got the experience now and that's all I need.  I'm ready to head back to my whole in the wall place, put my feet up and taste some authentic flavors at a fraction of the price.",1,0,1,GarGuPi L.,"Flushing, NY",87,496,1696

2.0,2/8/2009,"The military follows a ""No man left behind"" policy.  I follow a ""never leave a dessert uneaten"" policy.  On January 29, 2009, for the first time in my life, I didn't finish a dessert.  I understand leaving behind the crust of a pie, but I left the whole dessert on the table.Headed to Ilili for restaurant week - because I had been here once before for summer 08 RW and loved it.To start, we ordered calamari, stuffed grape leaves, hummus and falafel.  I loved the falafel and calamari - the calamari wasn't fried and was soaked in a jalapeno sauce.  The stuffed grape leaves were super tiny, and the hummus was just okay.  The boyfriend hated the hummus and thought it was one of the worst parts of the meal.I ordered the beef kebabs, and really all that was edible on the dish was the beef.  A little salad was on the side, and really just tasted like salty greens.  The peppers on the kebabs had a weird after taste.  So I ate some more okay tasting hummus.For dessert, I remembered I had a dense chocolate candy bar last time, so I decided to go with a traditional Lebanese dessert with simple syrup and bananas.  The dish arrived.  There were three scoops of creme, syrup at the bottom and maybe 6 banana slices.  I dipped my spoon in.  The cream had a consistency of cool whip, without the sugar.  The simple syrup tasted like sun screen lotion.  You know that spray on sun tan lotion?  I might have well been spraying that into my mouth.  After about three bites, I couldn't take it anymore and pushed it away from me.  The boyfriend did the same.  When both of us turn down food, there clearly is a problem.I understand restaurants have off nights, but this experience was not how I remembered it. Granted the restaurant was a lot busier than this time around, and maybe that's why the food wasn't that great.  Giving it two stars only because I loved it the first time.",6,1,1,Laura F.,"Cortlandt, NY",70,186,18

The amount of food and quality of food was phenomenal n the restaurant week menu. My favorites were the Phenocian fries, the hummus, calamari, the chicken skewers, and the Lebanese wine. We weren't big fans of the traditional dessert and the smokey baba ganoush but couldn't stop raving over the honey pastry and everything else that we had.   We left being the biggest fans.When we arived we were greated and treated amazingly well by the hosting staff.

3.0,1/31/2009,"I went to Ilili for Restaurant Week last night, and I had mixed feelings about the experience.  The space of the place was nice with tall ceilings and roomy tables.  The food itself was a mixed bag however.  My friend and I ordered the beef tartar, baba ganouj, calamari, and lamb for appetizers.  The portions were generous, but with mixed results.  The calmari was excellent, but the beef tartar was lacking in taste and consistency.  The lamb was served in a pizza-style which was fabulous.  But the the baba ganouj was not good.  For entrees, we had the cod and filet mignon kebabs.  The cod was cooked nicely, as well as the kebab.  But the portions was small, even for that of restaurant week.  The Candy Bar desert was ok, nothing spectacular - just a hard brownie/mousse with chocolate pudding.  Overall, it was an ok dining experience - nice ambience, but hit-n-miss with the food.",0,0,0,Wailun C.,"New York, NY",9,56,0

4.0,1/29/2009,"I met up with a bunch of my college friends for Winter Restaurant week and decided to try out Ilili. Our party was 9 people and we booked a reservation for 7pm. The front of house was very friendly, with the exception of one of the hosts who wouldn't let us sit in the lounge while we waited for a table. My friend who was first to the restaurant was there sitting on the couch when we arrived. He only stood up to say hi to us and while we all stood talking, the other people sitting down had left. They came and cleaned the table and we then tried to sit down again, and some host said we couldn't sit there because it was reserved. That was just a bunch of BS, because the first person of our party was sitting there not 5 minutes ago! It is a lounge area where you sit and wait for your table, how can that be reserved? I'm not talking about the bar or anything, these were just couches and coffee tables! That pissed me off and the first impression of a place speaks volumes. The whole first impression was completely off putting. The rest of our night has to make up just for that. Good thing the service in the actual restaurant was excellent.The actual eating area had very dim lighting, a wide variety of music and the décor was very interesting and sophisticated. For their restaurant week menu you get two appetizers, one main and one dessert for $35. Our waiter told us that 2 of any of the appetizers could feed the whole table. So we ordered the following: hommus, lahmajeen (looked like minced lamb on a flatbread), crispy calamari, veal sweatbreads, fried lamb brains, chankleech (feta cheese, onions, tomato and zaatar), fattoush (Lebanese garden salad), kibbeh nayeh (tartar of beef), falafel, mekanek (lamb sausage), warm eggplant and Phoenician fries. The waiter brought out some pita bread, labne (strained yogurt) , baba ghannouj and pita chips for us on the house. Of all the sides, I enjoyed the warm eggplant, the labne and pita chips, the fattoush, kibbeh nayeh,, chankleech and hommus. The falafel was dry, the calamari was under seasoned and not crispy at all, the mekanek was very salty and the lahmajeen was okay, not spectacular. The Phoenician fries taste like fries from Pomme Frites, which are pretty good. I couldn't bring myself to try the fried lamb brains, as I was sitting next to my friend who is a biology TA and started talking about mad cow disease. We did notice that the menu they posted on the restaurant week website had changed from what we were looking at on the table. The main dish I wanted to order was no longer listed, as well as some of the sides. I wanted to have a lamb shank dish, but since it was not on the menu, I opted for the Ilili burger. The options for the main course was chicken shish taouk, Sea Bass, Fillet of Dole, Vegetarian Fatte, Ilili Burger and Beef Kebab. I don't recall what was on the supplement menu. The ilili burger was very good and I especially enjoyed the dipping sauce. It came with a side salad as well. For dessert they had homemade Lebanese ice cream, Achta (traditional Lebanese dessert with syrup and bananas), Beignets with strawberry and syrup, and ilili candy bar. I chose the homemade ice cream, pistachio flavored. It was smooth and delicious, not too heavy but a nice simple flavor. I also tried the achta, which I did not like at all. The comments around the table were that the achta tasted like you were eating perfume, or my favorite: like you were eating whipped butter and a glade scented candle. The best dessert of the bunch, is by far the beignets. They basically tasted like small fried donuts (or zeppelin's?) and came with strawberries and syrup. The were still warm and crispy.  Overall, the food was pretty good and the restaurant service was excellent.",1,0,0,Olivia L.,"Alhambra, CA",13,41,21

4.0,1/23/2009,"i wasn't sure what to expect for Restaurant Week. most everyone has probably experienced the basic chicken food item for a restaurant's RW menu. I took a brief glimpse at ilili's menu and saw the abundance of choices and thought there was potential at this place. order a main entree from 10 items (four of which were for an extra five dollars), two sides from 18 choices, and a dessert from four choices. i wasn't expecting to have huge amounts of food for $35. i chose the nabbeh kayeh (beef tartar) and ilili wings as my starters, lamb kebab as my main entree, and awaimat (lebanese beignets) as my dessert. for the table, we ordered hummus, in anticipation of not having enough food. the hummus was so-so, i think there was too much lemon juice in the hummus which affected the taste. after this, my table mates and i were quite stunned when the starters were brought out. there was an abundance of food on each plate. my nabbeh kayeh came with onions, mint leaves, and jalapenos to suit to taste (with the requisite pita of course). there were six wings in a basket for me. My table and I had a lot of food to split between us. Calimari, lamb sausages (not a favorite of mine), the chicken liver (too much liver flavor for me), fried lamb brains (don't let the body part gross you out -- it was pretty damn good). i had to lay off the pita because we still had the main entree. the lamb kebabs were ok. i thought the meat a little dry and didn't have the gamey flavor that i like with my lamb. it was still so very filling. my dinner companions had the cod and dorade (tasty fish dishes) and the duck kebabs (that was ok). my beignets were yummy. dipped in an orange blossom syrup, the beignets had a nice light outer surface, and the innards were so comparatively gooey. it was a great end to my dinner.the place itself seemed more lounge-like than eatery-like. the lights were totally dim, one would come close to shouting to talk to people at one's own table. it was very comfortable to eat there. and for the dudes who're thinking of eating here, there was a LOT of eye candy. not sure if this is because of restaurant week or what not. just saying is all.",0,0,0,Sal C.,"Forest Hills, NY",64,68,5

But now at least I know to push a little next time I call...Anyhow, once seated, we got right down to bidness with the cocktail menu which focused on fresh infusions like basil and cilantro or citrus bevvies - though it seemed they had something for everyone - and with the help of our waitress, ordered the ""Petit Sampler"" plus a side of sprouts and fries (I'll get to those later). Let's just say there was nuttin petit about this sampler. It said it served from 3-5 but our group of 3 hardly made a dent. And at $60, I also think it's the more affordable option than ordering straight off the menu. Now the fries. Listen, I know I'm in a Greek/Med restaurant - with an incredibly authentic menu - but when the waitress said these were the best fries she ever had, I listened. And yes, they were damn good. Although we were clutching our stuffed bellies, of course we finished off the meal with dessert! We got the Mediterranean candy bar and you better believe we finished every bite.

The steak was filet mignon, which may account for the price. We had this ""chewy"" ice cream which was the main reason for going. (BF wanted to try it...yea, he's a bit strange). It was good though! I had one of the more traditional Labanese desserts (wanted to stretch the palate, you know, you gotta!). It had a custard and was surrounded by rose water and crushed pistachios. Rich, but light.

3.0,10/30/2008,"I am not really a Lebanese cuisine aficionado but this is one of the better places to serve it up.Not sure why people are calling it ""fancy""- the space is pretty modern-big and open with dimmed lighting at the bar.  I wouldn't call it particularly fancy- I would be comfortable wearing leggings or denim here.  Then again I'm naturally pretty glamorous so who knows...  Food*Labne- tasted just like tzatziki but with a nicer texture.  *Brussel sprouts- normally hate them but was coaxed into ordering them- turned out to be surprisingly tasty and I wound up eating the whole plate myself. *Kibbeh Naya (steak tartar) didn't taste much like steak tartar at all.  Edible but not enjoyable. *Manti pasta sounded good but was greasy and the stuffing was reminiscent of store made tortellini. *Kashkawan Cheese - Sounds delicious (duck egg/desert truffle) but just tastes like a greasy mess of questionable ingredients... *Mekanek - waiter insisted I order this even though I was doubtful.  Didn't like it- tasted like greasy, oily, sausage which is essentially what it was. I wanted to try the lamb ribs but the waiter advised against it.  Also wanted to try the quail but they were sold out. Dessert:*Caramelized banana Bread Pudding- Delicious- moist and great condiments.*Acchta- Nice fluffy texture but not something I could finish alone.*Ice Cream- REALLY disappointing.  I had read on Grub Street about the ""chewy"" ice cream- there's nothing chewy about it, and not tasty at all.  Usually I love exotic flavors and fun textures but this is barely edible.  They should ditch the ice cream and source from Laboratorio del Gelato- think everyone would be happier that way.  Cocktails- there's a full bar but the cocktail list consists of 5 drinks. They are all well made though and most people would be happy with one of them. I love elderflower liquor so a plus that they have that in one or two of the drinks. Switched servers a couple times- a couple of them were really knowledgeable and friendly another one had no idea what they were doing- from what I understood he was in training.  I would recommend this to anyone into Lebanese cuisine or for business lunch in the west 20s.  Also recommend getting a Lebanese waiter who knows what they are talking about.",2,0,2,Elena V.,"New York, NY",104,191,232

The menu (and service) is very uneven with some dishes that shine (sauteed brussel sprouts) and some that miss outright.  However, if you go in with a mind to share and try different items you will probably be pleased with the result as it is a good location to have a dinner with friends.

5.0,9/17/2008,"I just came back from a dinner meeting with partners and luckily they chose a place near the office cause it's been a rough week and I was just really tired.  They ended up making reservations for Ilili and my desires to go home and sleep kind of faded away.  I was looking forward to chatting with these guys but the fact that it was going to be over dinner at Ilili's made it exponentially better.  Let's talk about the space - this place looks like a small place from the outside - you've probably walked by it a few times and never even knew it was there since the windows are all tinted.  When you open the front door you're introduced to a whole new world of amazement.  The interior design of the place is so clean, so streamlined that it's hard to believe that something so simple can be so beautiful to look at.  The lights are dimmed enough that you can still see what you're eating but at the same time it's dark enough that you literally start to unwind just by sitting there. So let's get to the food - simply amazing.  I've always had a love for Middle Eastern food like Greek, Israeli, etc.  Hummous, Baba Ghanoush, schwarma, halal, etc. but this place has a menu to die for.  They have the standard fair of Hummous with pita chips (which was on the house - chickpea puree, lebanese tahini, lemon, and olive oil - pretty standard fair, but was very tasty nonetheless), but we ordered a few starters and shared among the people at the table.  Tonight we ordered: Baba Ghanoush with warm pita bread (eggplant, lebanese tahini, and tomato - absolutely perfect), Falafel (fried chickpea and fava bean dumplings - perfectly done) Sweet Lamb Ribs with a strawberry reduction - a little sweet but very tender, Black Stone Shrimp (w/ Garlic, Jalapeno, cilantro - even though it's not spicy but was very tasty), Beef Kibbeh (fried spiced dumplings filled with ground beef and pine nuts - which was absolutely amazing), and lastly, the Duck Shwarma which comes in a cone that was not only very well presented, but one of the most favorite dishes of the night.  It only comes with two cones so if you have more than two people, make sure you order more than one, which is what we were forced to do.  By far one of the best selections of the menu.  If you don't like duck, go for the Beef version - you won't be disappointed - trust me.  We ended the night sharing a few desserts over coffee and cappuchino - the 'Candy Bar', which is really rich but split into 3 pieces, it wasn't so bad.  If you're a chocolate lover, this is a must have and we got the Banana Nut Bread pudding which sounds and looks really sweet, but was so good I was tempted to lick the plate but since it was a business dinner, I managed to control myself.  They also gave us a complimentary plate of Baklava - small pieces but unparalleled. They have lots of signature drinks and by far, this is one of the best Mediterranean restaurants I've ever been to, and trust me - this will not be the last time.  Since it's so close to the office, it'll be hard not to go at least a few times a month for lunch or for dinner.  Despite the exotic menu, the decent service - who aren't afraid to make recommendations, and the sexiness of the decor, the prices really aren't too bad compared to other restaurants of this caliber.  If you want to impress a date, a client, or you're just looking to have some really good food in a place that has a really good vibe to match - you have got to come to this place.  No, they are not paying me to endorse these guys - the food really is that good.  They have a few small private rooms and the place is absolutely huge for a 5th Ave establishment.  I'm impressed - and that's not very common.  Enjoy folks.",4,2,4,Jonathan L.,"New York, NY",329,95,2

The best of the four, without a doubt, was the colorado lamb ribs. I thoroughly enjoyed the appetizer portion of our meal.For the entree, we had the Kafta (mixed beef and lamb) and the Pink peppercorn crusted black cod. The cod was very good, much better than the Kafta.. unfortunately it seemed the Kafta pales in comparison to most of the appetizers. (I'd easily rather have a full plate of Colorado Lamb Ribs than the Kafta.. did I mention how good the lamb ribs were? =)Dessert for us was home made Lebanese ice cream and the Achta.

The food was fantastic and I felt like our waitress truly knew the menu and the food, which is always helpful. She gave us great suggestions. I came with my bf and we each had a choice of two appetizers, all four served tapas style which was nice. So we had the hummus- good, a little too whipped up for my taste but good overall, which was served with warm pita, which was also good and not over toasted, but I've had better. The Rock Shrimp- delicious, simple and not overcooked just the way I like them. I hate when there are flavors trying to overpower the delicate flavors of seafood. The Falafel- Good, but I've had better in Brooklyn, although the sauce was delicious.The standout though was sashimi with wasabi Baba Ganoush- hot damn. that was the most amazing thing i have ever tasted. it melted away in my mouth and i wanted more! For the main course it was the striped bass- more melt in my mouth seafood that i gulped down in a matter of minuted it was so good! And lamb kabobs for the man, who wouldn't share. After this we were sure we couldn't eat another bite, until homemade apricot ice cream made it to our table... and we ate every last drop.Overall the food is fantastic, but pretty pricey for small portions.

I could eat another bucket full. And that sauce was oh-so-good!The hummus was great - not too chalky or nutty.The tahini was super tart - the way I love it.The cocktails are not for wimps... they pack a delicious punch (harhar).But the very best part of Ilili, which makes me give it 5 stars, despite the atrocious service, was that they use sumac in almost every dish, and even some of the drinks! This is my very favorite spice in the world, and not found at all in Western cuisine!So, come here for excellent food, and a really cool interior (high ceilings!!!), but not the service. Lower your expectations of the service, so you won't be disappointed when your menu is tossed in your direction or your server brings the check to your table while you are only half-way through your meal.

We all tried their restaurant week menu.  The Restaurant Week Menu offered 2 tapas-style appetizers, a main entree, & a dessert:Appetizers: I ordered Baba Ganoush (eggplant dip) & Black Iron Shrimp (shrimp sautéed with cilantro, jalapeno, and garlic in a mini cast iron skillet).  The shrimp was very savory.  The dip was good... loved that the pita bread was served warm.I got the pink peppercorn crusted Black cod as the main entree.  The portion was a bit small and it was a tad salty though.Dessert: I ordered the traditional Lebanese dessert: Achta: a traditional Lebanese dessert with bananas, chopped nuts sprinkled on top with simple syrup which had lavender or some kind of floral essence in it.   It was way too sweet for me, only had 2 spoonfuls and I was done.  My friends loved it though... they have more of a sweet tooth and helped me finish it off.Service was quite attentive.

The bathrooms are also fantastic.Enough about the space - let's talk food. Ilili is tapas/small plates-style. They have a fairly extensive menu with plenty of options...veg, fish, meats, etc. We were a party of 6 and ordered about 10 different plates. They bring out a labne (Lebanese cream cheese) with fresh lavash on the house which was very tasty and a nice touch. The baba ghanouj made with roasted eggplant was some of the most flavorful baba ghanouj i've ever had. I guess I'll go through the other dishes I remember:-Pita: they brought lots of pita. it was all fresh and warm and puffy and delicious. -Baba ghanouj: mentioned above-Hommus: very smooth and lemony. it didn't knock my socks off, but it was very nice.-Sweetbreads (special): mmm. i love sweetbreads. these were very well prepared with a nice garlicky sauce and some pickled vegetables. very yummy.-Beef kebabs: made with filet mignon. perfectly cooked (medium rare) and nicely spiced.-Hamachi (or some other raw fish I can't remember the name of): also delicious. came with a nice spiced baba ghanouj that paired very well.-Mekanek (lamb sausages): these sausages were cute and delicious. nice and savory, meaty flavor balanced out the other lighter/more veg dishes.-Black cod: kinda bland, but cooked to perfection. came with some very nice roasted fennel that gave it a bit of a kick.-Moujadara (green lentil puree): also a little on the bland side, but served as a nice spread on which to put some mekaneks or beef kebab. -Chicken shish taouk: my sister always needs  to order a chicken dish (she's picky), and this one was decent. it seemed pretty standard, but the chicken was moist and flavorful.I feel like we may have ordered other dishes, but they are escaping me at the moment. We had a bottle of Malbec which was a decent value and relatively bold. The service was excellent - our waitress was very knowledgeable and clearly practiced her Arabic pronunciation. Overall, Ilili (yes, it is difficult to read/pronounce) is a nice choice. I would go back....but I didn't pay or see the bill, so I can't really comment on value.

The mixed grill came with one skewer each of beef kebab, lamb kofte, and grilled chicken. While the portions looked skimpy, and did not come with rice, it turned out to be perfect and got us both stuffed.The duck shawarma was certainly very interesting (it was mixed with grilled figs and pomegranate), and it was presented in cones placed in a plastic stand, so that the shawarma stayed perfectly wrapped. Like I said, duck-fig-pom was a new concept for me, but I totally loved it! After the first bite, I chewed and thought to myself, ""Hmm.""....and after the second, it quickly turned to a ""mmm how do I not keep from stuffing this in my face.""We didn't have any room left for dessert, but when they brought us our check they brought out two small pieces of baklva, which were ok.Extra points for the wonderful service (from our waiter) and the manager asking us how we enjoyed our meal.Extra points for the garlic whip that came with our kebabs that I have not found anywhere else in NY!!We will definitely be going back!",4,1,3,Mimo R.,"New York, NY",105,105,0

They didn't bother to offer us the dessert menu (haha! gee, I wonder why?) But I was surprise they didn't hurry our meals along either. The feel of the restaurant offered a relaxed ambience in the midst of a quite deserted section of NYC that given night. I was actually taken aback such an elegant restaurant existed amongst the deserted streets when the cab driver told us we've arrived. (if that totally made me sound like a non-local, it's cause I am Californian^^)What we ordered:-hommus (the combination of the texture & taste = yum! )-garden salad (fresh! & the dressing went perfect with it)-black iron shrimp (a lil bit spicy but it had a nice kick to it)-seared wagyu beef (a bit too salty for me; had to balance with rice)-lamb chops (omg the sauce made this my favorite dish of the night)-chicken shish taouk (the meat was so tender and juicy)-bowl of rice (this was so good! moist, not dry)They also provided warm pitas for us.Bonus dish!I don't even know what it's called but they gave us something to munch on - on the house - while we waited for our food.I would definitely come here again :)",1,1,1,Corliss L.,"San Francisco, CA",58,35,22
3.0,2/27/2008,"I guess I disagree with everyone else -- except for the excellent eggplant marinated in heaven, I thought everything was mediocre.  The space is pretty cool, with lots of large, warmly lit rooms that gives it the feel of some sort of middle eastern bazaar cum midtown restaurant.  It was really loud, although just short of annoying.  The staff that work there are actor/model types who are extremely friendly and helpful.  The kitchen is where it fell short for me and my friend.  We ordered hummus (better at Mamoun's), octopus (oily and bland -- and I loves me some octopus), crisply calamari (also bland), that heavenly eggplant, and some fairly good cheese rolls (how can you go wrong with deep fried cheese?).  We just stopped after that, because nothing seemed to have real flavor -- like a Lebanese version of the Olive Garden (minus the bottomless pasta bowl).  We couldn't even get a good buzz on because we didn't like the wine either.   On the plus side, we got out of there for $85 including tax, tip and wine -- not hard to do in NY, but also not really worth it.  I really liked the room and the waitstaff seemed just great, but I won't go back.",2,0,1,Bob H.,"Manhattan, NY",9,45,0
4.0,1/30/2008,"This was by far the best of my 2008 Restaurant Week picks!You get two appetizers per person on this RW menu, and since I was with two other friends, we maximized and got 6 in total.The Kashkawan Cheese - duck egg with cheese and truffle - despite sounding weird was definitely my favorite part of the meal. We also got the amber jack, hommus, falafel, chankleech, and lahmajeen (the last of which I couldn't eat). Everything was good - and despite the fact that there was way too much food for 3 people, we managed to finish it all. They also give you an unlimited amount of warm, soft pita.Moving on to the main courses... I got the branzini (fish) which I really enjoyed. The blood orange sauce complimented it really well. One of my friends got the black cod (on the waiter's recommendation), and was slightly disappointed by it. It was good, but it definitely wasn't as flavorful as everything else on the menu. My other friend got the beef kebab and was very happy with it.The desserts were unique, but all very tasty. My only disappointments were that the the baklava assortment wasn't available and that two of the desserts were very similar. So, instead we got the three remaining dessert options so we could sample them all. The achta is a traditional lebanese dessert that our waiter described as bread pudding without any bread. It was really light and flavorful, with a hint of rose water. The essmalieh was a napoleon that used achta as the filling. I can only describe the outer pasty of it as something resembling fried shredded wheat. (Still good though). The last dessert on the menu was an assortment of sorbets: passionfruit, coconut, and blackberry. The passionfruit was somewhat overpowering, but great in small doses. The blackberry was good, but nothing special. The coconut was my favorite - not too sweet without losing the coconut flavor. Like everything else that we ordered, we scraped the dessert plates clean.But, despite eating a ridiculous amount of food, none of us felt disgustingly full. We all just left satisfied and planning our next trip back.As an afterthought, the restaurant itself was really beautiful - with wood beams everywhere and a very geometric design. Red chairs and accents added to the decor. I just thought the restaurant itself was kind of out of place on the block of random buildings that is 5th ave between 27th and 28th. But, who cares? The food was good and it's close to where I live so I'll definitely be coming back!",2,1,1,Anuja G.,"New York, NY",47,123,7
4.0,1/29/2008,"I enjoyed dining here with a friend during restaurant week last week. It was a good deal w/the $35 prix fixe menu. We both enjoyed our wine & food. The service was friendly and down to earth. Having just flown across the country that day it was a nice way to unwind in the beautiful, spacious setting. We made our reservations on Open Table so no issues getting a spot to eat right away (it was also an early meal, 7:30pm on a Wednesday night) but there were other open tables where we sat (back of the restaurant & up the stairs, wow that place is big)!The highlights of the meal were the ""hummos"" which was good ... as were the piping hot pitas & complimentary appetizer (some delicious flatbread & some sort of whipped up cream spread & olives). I also liked the ""lahmahjeen"" (pita topped with lamb, onion & tomato). I could have lived w/out the ""baba ghannouj"" (eggplant, lebanese tahini & pomegranate) which would normally be a home run for me. But I was surprised at how much I really enjoyed the chicken (""chicken shish taouk""). My friend's black cod was delicious too. For dessert we had the homemade sorbet because we were too stuffed to try anything heavier. It was much too sweet. We were so full it wasn't a huge deal but nonetheless a little disappointing. Not a compliment or disappointment but another observation, I love pomegranate but they seemed to want to put it in everything, (maybe it was the wine that made that point somewhat entertaining at the time).Side note: the bathrooms were pretty unique & cool, also very clean which is GREAT in my book (despite reading some scary Yelp stories below after I went of people managing to lock themselves in the stalls, there was a woman selling toiletries in the bathoom so I'm sure she could rescue you if you got stuck & she was there). The server was also very good about splitting our tab (I had to expense the meal for work), I felt really bad asking but she was great about it. We made sure to leave a good tip!I do recommend this place. Overall a great meal, nice ambiance, good service. One word overall: YUM!",0,0,0,Abby W.,"New York, NY",59,274,2
3.0,1/24/2008,"After being a Yelp voyeur for almost a year, I've decided to break my silence after my experience last night at Ilili.  While their food is four stars, I'm hoping Ilili will realize that although they are located next door to 230 Fifth, they don't need to covet thy neighbor's attitude.  First off the space is really cool, although the many mirrors can be a bit confusing (both me and my friend, who arrived separately, almost walked into the mirror by the entrance).  We decided to start off with drinks and apps in the lounge, but asked the hostess if there would be a wait for table if we wanted to have a full dinner. She kindly assured us that there would be none.  Once seated, our lounge waitress seemed a bit overwhelmed when we told her we simply wanted appetizers, unsure whether to give us the prix fixe restaurant week menu or the regular one.  She was visibly calmed when we asked for both.   I ordered the Lebanese wine, which was the first I had tasted from the region and it was amazing.  For apps, we had hummus and babaghanoush, which were both great and accompanied by incredibly fresh, delish, honey-flavored pitas.   An hour-later, we decided to get a table for dinner, but were told by our bouncer-esque hostesses that there was now a twenty-minute wait. This would not have not been an issue at all, if the two-floor restaurant was not half-empty.  Both the first dining room, which caters mostly to large groups had about four empty tables, and the second floor, where we sat, was lined with at least five empty tables for two.   I don't mind waiting for a table at a great restaurant, but no need to create an illusion. Maybe the mirrors confused her?Once seated, our new waitress was so friendly that we didn't mind her overly apologetic attitude as our food was continually slow to arrive.  We ordered more apps, graped leaves and chankleech, a deliciously-seasoned feta, onion and tomato salad.  We then moved on to kebabs, lamb for my friend, tuna for me. Both yummy....for dessert we ordered the Essmalieh, a napoleon of shredded philo and Achta (like clotted cream) sprinkled with shredded pistachios. It took almost 15 minutes to come, but was soo yummy, that after four hours at Ilili, it almost made me forget about the service issues, which were further acquiesced by complimentary baklava.Dinner was about $50 each, not to bad, considering what we ordered.  If I'm craving great Mediterranean food I make a reso and go back, but I'd probably be happier at Mamouns.",4,3,4,Jess W.,"NY, NY",4,17,4
4.0,1/11/2008,"Mediterranean fare at its finest.  I loved the space and the small dish options, though it's hard to keep the bill down given the price points.  Also pricey, the wine list, though we had a lovely Spanish red for $50 that was a good choice.For food, we had the Octopus, Menti (sp? like Lebanese gnocci), Black Iron Shrimp (yum!); a Feta Cheese-onion-tomato dish (was called something like Mekaleech, but can't remember) as well as the Beef Schwarma (hard to share) and tuna and lamb (the best I have ever tasted) kabobs.   Dessert was the only disappointing part: Date with Chocolate, a less-than-memorable chocolate cake.   (FYI: If this was actually a real date, you'd conveniently forget to call him/her back if he/she asked you out again.)",1,0,1,Meryl C.,"Brooklyn, NY",393,408,23
4.0,12/3/2007,"Wonderful scene to bring a date. It's pricey, but if you can get past that, it's perfect for a NYC first date. She will be impressed with your knowledge of a new space and unless she also happens to be familiar with the culture, you also have the chance to impress her with your knowledge of Lebanese cuisine. (yes, that means you should go to their site, check out their menu and google the entrees you don't recognize)The decor is fabulous and you can easily enjoy dinner in the couches in the bar/lounge or head upstairs to one of the more remote tables. I imagine when this place becomes more popular, it will be noisy, but for now it's a very quiet and romantic atmosphere. Also, it's a small plates menu -- which isn't readily apparent -- due to the large prices, so come prepared to try new things and to share with your special someone.Two things to watch out for: service and texture. Lebanese food is different from most of the more mainstream cuisines so be prepared for some things to be a bit squishier and softer than you may be used to. If you choose to make an adventure out of this, you will be pleasantly surprised and your ladyfriend will be impressed with your willingness to try new things. The food actually is VERY GOOD, just different. If you find you can't control your gag reflex, then you probably need to stick to the grilled items or stay in the Upper East side with the rest of the non-foodies.As of this writing the servers are still learning the menu themselves, --apparently it's hard to recruit Lebanese staff these days--so don't expect them to be a great resource for your culinary selections. Otherwise, they are quite attentive.As stated above, the food here is very good.",3,1,3,Adrian M.,"Washington, DC",5,35,0
