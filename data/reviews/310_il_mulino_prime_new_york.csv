4.0,4/28/2019,Came for dinner with a reservation in advance. Had to wait 30 mins before being seated. Manager might have sensed the frustration and offered completely Prosecco. After finally being seated it took almost an hour for pasta to come out. Food was pretty good. I did enjoy it. However doesn't seem like anything special that you can't get elsewhere.,0,0,0,Valentina B.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",10,17,13
4.0,4/21/2019,I came here for lunch for restaurant week. There were 6 people in the place. I was in a party of 4.We ordered the appetizer and entree with wine pairings. The food was good.

4.0,4/21/2019,"Had a nice experience here. Came in for a big family dinner for my mom's birthday. We got a bunch of oysters to start and a few appetizers, very solid. Everyone was really happy with their entrees, I tried a little bit of everyone's - I went with the chicken parm myself, and it was really fantastic and huge! Great presentation. The frutti di mare was top notch, and the steaks were all really delicious that I tried. Only downsides would be that it's very pricey, which is fine of course, but with that, the wine selection was not very reasonable. A few in our party were not too happy that the cheapest bottle was $100+, given how much money on food we were spending. So just something to keep in mind. Regardless, the staff were all very kind and helpful and we all enjoyed ourselves.",1,0,0,Jeff T.,"Austin, TX",165,302,0
2.0,4/17/2019,"my wife , daughter and I dined here last Saturday, I'll keep this brief; not one bottle of wine under 105$, mediocre steaks,( if some of you five star reviewers think this place is a great steakhouse, you know nothing about steak. the appetizers are miniscule and ordinary, the desserts at least were ok.

4.0,4/4/2019,"Why is one not like the rest? For decades there was Il Mulino, one Il Mulino on West 3rd Street. Then there seemed to be Il Mulinos everywhere, well at least a few. But one Il Mulino is different from the rest and that one is Il Mulino Prime. While Il Mulino Prime has the great pasta dishes and other Italian/Italian-American favorites, it is really a steakhouse. Their signature dishes are ""prime"" cuts of beef that have been dry aged for 30 days. Great steaks, great pastas, super service and in the heart of Soho.",1,0,0,Frank A.,"Manhattan, NY",35,69,309

3.0,1/30/2019,"Went for restaurant week, 4 of us. 3 did the appetizer + entree and 1 did entree + dessert. All the appetizers were very good (meatballs, caprese and onion / tomato salad). Entrees came, salmon was very good, one hanger steak was cooked perfectly, the other was ordered medium and came close to well done, and it didn't seem like one cut, there were three end pieces. Last ordered spaghetti and it was crunchy.... Desert was the chocolate cake and was more crumble than anything. We did not finish it. Yes going for restaurant week we know to expect smaller portion and less quality but this was pretty sub-par even for that, and expected a little bit more consistency. Won't be back, and you can skip it for a many better places.Service was fine, though our waiter looked very bored and kept opening some bottle of liquor at the bar and sniffing it... it was very peculiar.",0,0,0,Alexander T.,"Brooklyn, NY",190,36,6
5.0,1/27/2019,"Ate there today with my brother-in-law, sister, niece and my father. Beautiful corner location on a lovely day in Manhattan. It is Restaurant Week and there was a condensed menu for the table with various options of steak, spaghetti and salmon as a main entree, appetizers and dessert for just $42 per person. The waiter was first class all the way and made us feel welcomed for first-timer'sWe all opted for this menu and two of us had the steak, two had the salmon and one the spaghetti. All were satisfied with their meals, service and overall decor and environment. There are only like 10 tables inside the place and we had a beautiful corner table that was comfortable and inviting.

The food is impeccable, service is outstanding, maître D' is like no other, drinks are delicious, etc. Appetizers we ordered- Burrata, shrimp cocktail, oysters.

1.0,10/30/2018,"The food was very good as was the service. However, I felt as if I was ripped-off. The meal for two was shared: bottle of wine ($95), one (1) appetizer, one (1) fish, and one (1) ravioli with truffles. The bill: $413. The pasta was $180. Although the pasta was an evening special, no price was disclosed upon ordering. Conversations with both the waiter and the manager about the $180 cost were fruitless.

2.0,9/27/2018,"Came here for a friends birthday and was very underwhelmed.  Having been to their other location uptown I was expecting a lot and was greatly disappointed after receiving my dishes.I do commend them on the quality service received but the food, can't say the same. Maybe the chef was having a off night? Who knows.For starters we had the meatballs, which were just okay.  Like most other Italian restaurants, Mulino serves their balls with ricotta, but gives you a minuscule amount. Minus points for that.Next we had a dozen and a half oysters. Kumamoto's to be exact. Now, I've had this oyster numerous times and they've become my favorite oyster so when they arrived slimey, and lacked any water inside of them I knew something was up. For entrees, I ordered two, the Cacio e pepe and their rack of lamb special.Cacio e Pepe, could've been way better. It lacked flavor and was noticeably different from the appetizer portion my friend received which had a far greater amount of pepper.The rack of lamb was cooked well but inedible due to the fact the sauce they covered it in was so overwhelmingly salty.Would I come back again?

2.0,7/6/2018,"I definitely won't be going back.  Don't charge me $9.50 for bottled water when the waiter came around and filled my glass out of a pitcher.  That pissed me off and the server took it off (after I pointed it out).  But the much bigger (and was not done on purpose unlike the water) was my $52 ribeye that was supposed to be medium rare and came out basically well done.  They corrected it with a new steak and gave my partner and I free cocktail but it made for a clumsy and lackluster meal overall. We ordered several other dishes including two ""specials"" -  the lobster ravioli and scallops.  The two best parts of our meal were my new steak and the cheese plate they offer as complimentary at the start.  The $14 truffle fries were a joke.  Very little flavor and essentially caliber of McDonald's. And I'm sorry but with $22 martinis and top tier pricing for entrees, I would rather go somewhere else where ambiance matches food quality and flavor.  This place is small and intimate and seems more like a neighborhood joint at first glance.  Nothing strongly delivered overall.",0,0,0,Fabian T.,"Orlando, FL",0,6,0

The meatballs were moist with a creamy ricotta sauce. The steak was surprisingly large and cooked to a perfect medium. I'm not a big tiramisu person, but I really enjoy it here. It's not too sweet or watery and has a nice balance in both taste and texture. You really can't beat that for the price! The restaurant is clean with a modern touch and service is prompt.

3.0,6/12/2017,"Came for lunch with coworkers to celebrate an important milestone. I have passed by this place numerous times but never came in to eat. It's beautiful in its relative sparseness. White walls with Hemingway quotes. Wrought iron chandeliers. Bella. Their menu looked extensive, but everyone ended up ordering from the lunch prix fixe menu - probably to try a little bit of three courses. The caprese for app and hanger steak entree was a popular combo. They had a lemon tiramisu dessert on the menu but they informed us that they had no lemon, just plain tiramisu. Strange. I got the Italian cheesecake. The pre-meal bread was a mix of long bread sticks and crispy flatbread with cheese baked on. Not freshly baked and probably either bought or premade a while ago. We all had a glass of wine to celebrate. The appetizers came out. One person got the tomato, onion, and bacon. The two hefty pieces of bacon was a pleasant surprise and made me regret my choice. But, once I got my caprese, I was pleased with three choice. The mozzarella was softer than I was used to but it was just firm enough to have substance. Now the place is pretty small - probably no more than 8-10 tables. And we were probably the second group to be seated. We waited a long time for our entrees. To the point that the waiter (manager?) swang by and said 30 seconds more. A few minutes later, our food appeared. Or hanger steak was served with just romaine instead of the arugula on the menu. And the steaks were pre-cut for us and generally over cooked. My co workers wisely ordered medium rare and I ordered medium. Ours all came out closer to medium well. Plus the steaks were hardly seasoned. One co worker who got the spaghettini had a fist size portion. I get it, prixfixe. So dessert also ended up being a wait. It was three cheesecakes and one tiramisu. What came out was one each of tiramisu, cheesecake, and chocolate cake. The manager quickly realized what happened and had the waiter just bring out 2 more cheesecakes. This kind of mistake I can live with since I got to try the chocolate cake too. The Italian cheesecake was less sweet and more crumbly than regular NY cheesecakes. But it was good. The chocolate cake was definitely better with rich chocolate flakes inside. Overall, great place to go for ambiance and scene. The service was great and everyone was friendly. But consistent with other reviews, it seems like it's past its prime.",0,0,0,Dan K.,"Albertson, NY",7,136,403
2.0,6/8/2017,"I went here for my birthday dinner and I have to say the food and atmosphere is incredible- definitely my style. Unfortunately, I have to give 2 stars because of the service here. We were brought out ""complimentary"" cocktails and appetizers just to find out that there had been nothing taken off bill. This is extremely unacceptable and embarrassing. After confronting multiple servers and even the manager, barely anything was taken off of our bill.

2.0,5/20/2017,"Does not deliver the quality to justify the price. Ordered the ink squid pasta with sea food aka frutti di mare, while it was tasty, the mussels, shrimp and scallops were peewee size. The dish was advertised on the menu under the pasta category but the waiter informed me that the price shown was for an appetizer size dish only and the entree size would be twice the cost. This is misleading and up selling. Lunch sans alcohol was about 50 bucks with tax and tip. That is an absurd amount to pay for pasta, anywhere! Not to mention, The service was inadequate, with the bar man doubling as a waiter, he could not attend to all the customers efficiently. The plus side was that the tap water was cold on a hot day, the food was brought out timely, the complimentary appetizer was savory.

1.0,5/17/2017,"Breaking it down into sections. Food:  Possibly the saltiest food I've ever had. My friend and I split a petit filet and a salmon--both tasted like salty potato chips. Atmosphere: Generic. Absolutely nothing special. Service: Absolutely horrible. The waiters kept bringing appetizers to the table that we didn't order so we assumed it was ""on the house"" because we didn't even want them--in fact we had tried to order different apps and the waiter said, ""No we are bring such-and-such instead""--and then we were charged for the unwanted, unordered apps at the end of the meal and the workers refused to change the bill to accurately reflect what we had ordered.

It was very nice of the restaurant to already split it up for us rather than have 3 different plates at a small table on top of our own plates. The octopus was so juicy. The crab was purely great. The grilled calamari was yummy too! They did the same with the oxtail parpadell pasta which by the way was delicious!!!! I also must say, the branzino was absolutely amazing. I was here about a year ago for restaurant week as well. I had the octopus, pasta, meatballs and steak. It was delicious then too and it was amazing last night!

2.0,10/18/2016,"Il Mulino is using their brand recognition to expand into the steak house business. The restaurant is small and pleasant enough. There is nothing special about the decor. The service is attentive.. The food is where things go south. The prices are outrageous given the quality of the dishes. I ordered a simple dinner - shrimp cocktail and the ribeye steak. The shrimp were good. I prefer the super jumbo meaty shrimp that I usually find at the best steakhouses. Theses were medium to large. The sauce was pretty bland. I would guess that it was not house made.A ribeye is supposed to have some fat in the meat - giving it more flavor than the strip or the filet cuts. My steak was way too fatty. I was pulling pieces of gristle out of my mouth after chewing. The sauce was the Chef M's signature sauce. Rather thin take on an au poivre, and just ok.This is a nice enough restaurant, but they should step it up with the kitchen and the meat sourcing if they continue to charge such high prices.",0,0,0,John L.,"Manhattan, NY",27,62,0

I ordered NY strip which is an additional $10 on top of restaurant week prices, i must say worst piece of beef I had. But I guess that is what is expected ordering steak from a non steakhouse. My husband salmon was cook well but we made sure we told he waiter on the rare side. I ordered truffled fries which was $12 and it was awful. The taste was slightly burnt truffle oil taste. It is a dish of plain fries, McDonalds fries were way better. We ended up paying $74 a person (no drinks) pretty hefty for pretty bad meal.",0,0,0,Cho T.,"Brooklyn, NY",7,15,15
2.0,7/29/2016,"Yelp is pretty accurate. I wish I'd yelped this place instead of going with the glowing reviews from other sites endorsed by the restaurants themselves. 5 star reviews: it's quite obvious you did not actually eat here or have a pretty low bar for flavor. Additionally, maybe you are friends or made friends with the staff who were having a particularly good day and took to you if you'd received good service because the 2-3 star yelps review all have a common thread- poor service and I am in complete agreement. The food wasn't awful- it was passable, but for the price, it was a disappointment. We were paying purely for the location and decor, not the quality nor execution of the cuisine... because there was little to none. The 4 and a half (3 yr old) of us had the prix fixe dinner for $42pp. We opted for some upgrades sans wine: ricotta meatballs, octopus (+$10), arugula salad, strip steaks (+$10), and wild salmon. Octopus was nicely charred but cooked about 20 seconds too long on each side that made it a bit dry and tough. Ricotta meatballs were textually lacking in any firmness, herbaceousness and salt. The sauce that would've saved the meatballs was lacking in quantity. Topped with 2 slices of stale crostini- it goes to show you can never judge a book by its pretty cover. After extended wait time, our entrees arrived and my discerning cousin immediately noticed the odd appearance of the New York strip steaks that 3 of us upgraded to. They were not on-bone, thick, tender nor seasoned- at all! I thought they were soft albeit bland but my companion quite vehemently insisted the steaks were sinewy, lacking in every flavor/texture profile that normal $54 cuts of meat should have. We were an hour in, tired, hungry and were not going to argue. It wasn't awful (to me) but definitely not good. The ""wild"" salmon on the other hand, very surprisingly was great. It was golden, crusty, red-brown throughout whereby judging from the appearance we thought they must've overcooked it. They didn't. It was exactly medium-delicious-tender-rare. The sides were completely negligible. In fact, what sides? You mean the home fries and a grape tomato and half of a grilled lemon on each of our plates? At least they were more memorable than the paltry, almost soggy ""truffle"" thin cut fries we ordered to share. I don't have the time nor heart to go onto dessert shaming- lemoncello tiramisu, ricotta cheesecake and chocolate cake. Yummy sounding, no? If you haven't already noticed the trend here, Il Mulino Prime is all foam, no beer. The best dish we had was the complimentary mini charcuterie starter. That is sad. I've spent too much energy on the food alone- which was just mediocre at best. For a brand touted as high end luring ppl to an approx $80pp dinner for restaurant week, Il Mulino Prime really needs to hire an entire new kitchen and wait staff. I've ragged enough about the cooks and haven't left enough time to gripe about the service!They were abhorrent. With an exception of a charming, gracious bartender. Our slicked back, not exactly appeasing waiter asked ""will you be opting for restaurant week menu"" not to assist us but as if to gauge our spending potential. It was not subtle. None of the inattention, pretentiousness, and rubbish was. As a service professional, the importance of putting a patron's comfort and desire before your own is paramount to the individual and company success. If I had an hour I would freely drill this into the entire service team at il Mulino Prime, because they so desperately need a good example. Btw... You cannot use ""aged"" hanger steak if it is not actually aged. It is clearly flaunted on the menu but when asked how the hanger was aged, the waiter acknowledged it isn't aged, whereby I promptly pointed to the print. He went into the kitchen and promptly return to apologize in-genuinely about the ""misprint""... it is Not aged. Even in the face of glaring hypocrisy and outright dishonesty, it is unlikely il Mulino would pull those menus. How many people unknowingly have ordered this misprint and went on their merry way? Every single one of them. How many times has il Mulino just shrug off this ""Oops"" Lie amongst other inaccurate descriptions? A good restaurant serves good food and pays full attention to every detail. A reputable restauranteur and a good manager stands behind their product and care about more than just turning the table. Clearly, I've already wasted 15 minutes of my time, the precarious staff's and yours!",7,3,0,Elisa H.,"New York, NY",1731,578,1105

The il Mulino brand is one that evokes visions of grandeur and class. Prime is no exception. I arrived on a Monday, in the pouring rain during Restaurant Week. Total monsoon - you know the kind. I immediately expected to be turned away or pushed off the stairs with a broom. In the words of the Scissor Sisters, I looked like a ""drowned, harassed, rat.""  Imagine my awe when I was welcomed in, offered a cloth napkin to dry myself and something to drink.  Ummm, mom? No, it was not my mom! She was home in Queens! It was was actually the gracious professional staff including the manager, Antonio, and bartender, Elvis.I sat at the bar, super early for my dinner reservation.  The Prosecco was perfectly chilled and refreshing.  They have these DELICIOUS complimentary rosemary truffle potato chips of which I could eat no less than 300,000.  I ate so many the bartender refilled my bucket.  Embarrassing.On to the real food which was as beautifully plated as it was delicious (don't take my word for it - look at the photos).  I highly recommend the octopus, the wild salmon and the swordfish.  All of these were outstanding.  For dessert, we had a ricotta pie and American coffee.  We enjoyed a dessert moscato - which I usually would turn down but this was NOT a saccharine moscato - it was sweet but crisp.  And it was pink! And bubbly!

3.0,6/24/2016,"I'll start off by saying the food and experience overall was really good, however, our server literally ignored us the entire time we were there. I understand being busy but when we first arrived we sat down and waited 15 minutes for a menu until someone else finally asked, "" you guys still don't have a menu?"" Then gave us a weird look. This pretty much continued our whole meal while our server rarely addressed us while others picked up the slack. Again I understand being busy but just because were younger than your other patrons doesn't mean we don't deserve the same attention and respect. Again the food was good and factoring in everyone else's effort it was a good experience i just think that everyone deserves the same treatment when your talking about a 300$ dinner especially.

2.0,2/1/2016,"The poor service here was enough to make me never want to come back, and also give a very low review. A group of us came here to celebrate my friend's birthday. We had the prix fixe lunch menu.Food: Some of the dishes tasted quite good and were well presented, but the portions were very varied and sometimes WAY too small. Caprese - The Caprese literally consisted of one slice of tomato and one slice of mozzarella. A little ridiculous. Ricotta Meatballs - Consisted of one meatball, which I had to admit, was delicious. The meat was super tender and almost melted in your mouth. The tomato sauce and ricotta accompanying it was delicious. Too bad there was only one.Orechiette - Wasn't anything particularly impressive. The sauce was broccoli based, which was a little unusual. The portion was large, but the taste was bland. Italian cheesecake - This was pretty good. The cheesecake was very rich and not too sweet. Atmosphere: The restaurant was well decorated, with a lot of white and clean lines. That being said, it felt a little stiff.Service: The service was extremely lacking. We had come in with a larger party, and while we waited for a couple of members of our party to arrive, we weren't given water for the longest time. We didn't even receive menus to look at until we asked for them, and the waiter didn't even ask whether we wanted to wait for the other two or just start ordering. Beyond that, there was only one waiter for the entire restaurant. When we finally got his attention to order, he came to the table, then walked away to help seat other guests who had just arrived. He also had a ton of confusion about what everyone had ordered when it came to dessert, and had to ask each person what they wanted 2-3 times. The waiter was standoffish during the whole meal and was slow to respond to anything we needed, whether it was water or to order additional drinks.We had also brought a cake to celebrate one of our friend's birthdays. The cake was pretty large and could serve 10-15 people. I was expecting for them to cut small slices for everyone, since our prix fixe menu also included a dessert component. When they cut it, they cut up the entire thing amongst 8 people...the slices were ridiculously large, and some of the cake went wasted. Afterwards, we had to ask them about the dessert to our prix fixe menu and they were surprised that we even wanted it after having the cake cake. Wasn't the dessert included in the prix fixe?...As if I would leave without something I would have to pay for. They reluctantly brought it to us.",3,0,0,Amanda C.,"New York, NY",245,197,13

There were empty tables during our lunch, so I wasn't sure why couldn't be seated in a normal table instead.Besides the service, the food was just ok.

Each course was tasty but not out-of-this-world. The chicken Parmesan while light, may have benefited from a bit more flavor. Certain wine by the glass selections will set you back upwards of $18 (ouch).However, I most disappointed by the service.

3.0,1/18/2016,"With a wonderful restaurant pedigree, I have to say I was a little bit disappointed by the lack luster food. The space is small and as soon as the restaurant filled up, it got extremely loud. While I understand a popular restaurant shouldn't be quiet, become sticks were simply just not good. We sat at the bar, and our bartender was attentive and provide a good service, however the food we ordered was, to be candid pretty average. I ordered a bowl of the simple spaghettini. The sauce was fine, not great. To me, there's nothing like an outstanding simple dish. I like to try simple dishes to see if they are remarkable, this was far from remarkable. We also ordered the hanger steak, which certainly wasn't bad as steak is usually hard to mess up providing it's cooked properly. The steak was cooked properly, but it just wasn't that wonderful. We had a few salads, etc. but again everything wasn't bad, but wasn't as good as one would hope for when going to an Il Mulino establishment. The menu was perhaps a little too diverse, with not as much focus on the ""prime"" aspect.

The portions are ridiculously small... The tomatoes and mozzarella appetizer came literally with ONE slice of tomato and ONE slice of mozzarella. Very disappointing. The meatball with ricotta was very delicious and again... ONE extra small meatball. WOW could not believe what I was seeing. For the entree we ordered the swordfish with fennel and the spaghettini with cherry tomatoes. I  would suggest the spaghetti since the portion was decent, but eating the swordfish alone will have you wondering what you should eat after leaving the restaurant. The dessert was nothing special, lemon tiramisu and italian cheesecake in very small portions ofcourse! Overall, food quality was not too bad but I have had WAY better italian food at Piccolo cafe on spring st with better service. Nobody checked on how we were doing during our meals.

1.0,8/2/2015,"If you are a person of color, please spend your money elsewhere. For people of color, seating is only limited to inside the restaurant as I assume that Claudio is concerned that non-white people by the windows will bring down the property value in a restaurant located in one of the most diverse cities in the world. We arrived at the restaurant for an early Sunday afternoon lunch, and upon our arrival, the host, Claudio, made us wait an exceptionally long time to be seated while he took a phone call. Strike 1.In addition, the restaurant was fairly empty and so we requested a seat by the window. To our request, he responded that that seat was reserved. When we confirmed that we had made a reservation, he responded that you had to make a ""special"" reservation for that seat. Strike 2.Over the course of our meal, a white couple came in who were seated at one table inside & then made a request to be seated by the window. That couldn't have made Claadio happier, and he made sure that their request was granted with no hesitation. Strike 3.Also, we called and spoke with Claudio to see if we could reserve this ""special"" seat for our next visit, and he told us that the seat does not require a special reservation and it's first come first serve. As a matter of fact, he seemed to be confused by the request. And so, for those people of color (Asian, black, Latino or other) reading this review, who are still interested in eating here, when you do go, just for fun, please request a seat by the window & see what fun excuse Claudio invents for you to not sit there. So, in summary, the small-minded host has incredibly poor management skills, and was so ungracious for our patronage that he didn't even have the courtesy to ask us about our service, although he made sure to ask all the white people if they were well.

We both started with the beefsteak tomato salad, which was amazing. I just love tomatoes! She got the Orecchiette with broccoli rabe and sausage, which was pretty good. The sausage pieces were very small. I got the salmon in a white wine and lemon sauce with asparagus, which was the better dish in my opinion. Both the salmon and asparagus were cooked to perfection! I got the cheesecake for dessert (since it's national cheesecake day and all), which was just okay. I would probably go for the chocolate cake next time. Service was attentive and quick, which was good since we both had to get back to work. We had no problem getting the server's attention, and everything was brought out relatively quickly.

5.0,7/29/2015,"Loving the original Il Mulino from my days (when parents visited) at New York University, I was happy to learn that Il Mulino opened a satellite location closer to my home. Il Mulino Prime has satisfied my expectations on all counts, from the more casual atmosphere, to the recognizable menu items from West 3rd street like Linguine with white clam sauce and clams oreganata. Sadly, one can't order my all time favorite Lobster Fra Diavlo or Veal Marsala here, so I will still have to go back to the original! I have also been to Trattoria Il Mulino, which is an even more casual incarnation, more of a pizza place, but Il Mulino Prime is for sure my favorite.

When we asked the waiter about the truffles they had to double check together with the manager to see if indeed the Black Truffle Sliders contains truffles... The sliders meat was super tiny and overcooked, moreover for $29 the sliders you expect more than a few fries to accompany them (e.g. A few veggies never killed anyone...)I'll pass the fact that when we ordered our entrees we also asked for 2 sides of truffle fries, and the waiter just omitted to mention that one of the entree was already including fries...Truffle fries that were still frozen in the inside, yummy!A very bad and expensive experience, I do not recommend this place at all",2,1,0,Guillaume B.,"New York, NY",11,13,5

It was tasty but when I saw next table, they had one more kind of thing on their plate. I'm sure that they ordered same thing and the plate was sarved to every table. Anyway, we started eating,but in the middle of eating it, suddenly the busboy came and cleared our table without asking. To other tables, they gave time and asked.I had a chicken dish and also next table ordered same. Again, next table had a better garnish, but mine was not. A dessert was also like that.

The ""filet mignon"" was flavorless and looked like it was about to run off the table. (Red as Rudolf's Nose). The Sauteed Mushrooms couldn't have been spicier, with no warning on the menu. The lobster Mac & Cheese had 3 small pieces of lobster included with the sauce and presentation of a TGI Fridays. I honestly do not understand how this place considers themselves as high-class or a quality restaurant. The restaurant staff was pushy and didn't leave us alone. The bus boy was the only worker that was pleasant. The warm lobster salad was the best thing on the menu. Literally everything else was a huge disappointment. I'd rather go to 100 other steakhouses in NYC than this. Our bill for two people was $250 and we only ordered a drink a piece. Also, a 5 oz Canada Dry plastic bottled seltzer was $5. (It was put on the table in the plastic bottle). Steakhouses don't do things like that. This place is a poor excuse for a steakhouse.

2.0,2/21/2015,"Came here for the first time for restaurant week and sadly to say, I was very disappointed. At first, the hostess was snooty at the door. The man gave me a face and a snooty comment when I told him that my friend cancelled last minute for the party of 3 and that it was going to be two people dining. He asked why I had not called and informed the restaurant. I told him again that it was a very last minute cancellation. Onto the actual dining experience: We had dinner here and the portions were absurdly small. I had restaurant week lunch at milos estudios earlier in the day and the portions were bigger than my dinner at il mulino prime. We both had the caprese salad and the short ribs ravioli. The Caprese salad was sort of small but seeing that it's supposed to be an appetizer, I was ok with the size. However, when our entrees came, I was dismayed at how small the portions were. It was just 2 ravioli. Seriously. Needless to say, we were out of there pretty fast and went home hungry that night. I understand that small portions are the norm at fine dining restaurants. We had lunch at Gotham Bar and Grill and small portions were small, but at least one, it was for lunch and two, it was absolutely delicious. However, not only were there small portions at Il Mulino Prime, the food was nothing spectacular.

2.0,2/20/2015,"RESTAURANT WEEK REVIEW:With the advent of restaurant week, I scrutinized each and every menu featured. My friend and I wanted a nice steakhouse, and after extensively looking over every menu, we decide Il Mulino Prime had the most appealing one. Filet Mignon, Lobster Mac and Cheese, and Short Rib Raviolis. What sounds more delicious? Needless to say, I was so excited.When we arrived, the ambiance was nice, A small, cozy dim-lit restaurant. The servers took our coats, seated us immediately (we had reservations for almost a month now, that's how excited we were) and brought us out a complimentary, but tiny cheese/meat/bread platter.My friend and I each placed our appetizer orders and the waiter literally just stared at us for 30 seconds and said nothing nor walked away. It was so uncomfortable and awkward, it hurt. We said something and he rudely told us we needed to order all three of our meals (appetizer, entree, dessert) in one shot. He seemed annoyed that we didn't know this. Maybe next time tell us and just don't stare us down like we're nuisances.Glass of wine - $16. Jeez. But you obviously need a glass of wine with dinner, so you pay for it regardless.THE FOOD:Appetizers: Beefsteak Tomato w/ Mozzarella - One tomato, one piece of cheese. You can get this anywhere.Arugla Salad - Your standard small starter salad. A nice entry into my entree. Probably a $5 charge max.Entrees:(Pre-Meal - I hyped up this ravioli dish in my head since the moment I saw the restaurant week menu. As soon as I made the reservation to come here, I knew I was ordering this.) Sadly,  I couldn't have been more let down. Beef Short Rib Raviolis: I expected 5 raviolis on a plate with a nice light butter sauce (as described on the menu...maybe I shouldn't have had any expectations). But all I have to say is Wow. There were only 2 raviolis on the plate. TWO. TWO RAVIOLIS. The short rib inside was delicious but there was hardly any of it. The pasta dough itself wasn't cooked as it should have been either. The worst part of the dish: the mystery meat concoction under the raviolis. I swear this looked/tasted like some microwavable beef ragu you cook up when you're in a hurry and need to be somewhere. It was different meat than the actual short rib in the ravioli and it was utterly DISGUSTING. The flavors of the ragu and the meat and the short rib were so off. The juiciness and brisket-like texture of the short rib is enough for it to stand alone. Altering it with a ragu made for a very weird flavor profile and I felt my face contorting into a look of disgust.LUCKILY (and the reason I gave this place two stars instead of one)The Lobster Mac and Cheese saved the day. Of course, we had to pay an extra $10 but I couldn't be happier I did. This dish was in an entirely different league than its microwavable ravioli dinner friend. It was savory, flavorful, not too cheesy or salty. There were some huge lobster pieces in there and a good amount of them as well. Dessert:We both ordered cheesecake, and while cheesecake is not supposed to be runny or moist, it should have a nice melt in your mouth flavor. This particular one however, was so dry, and had an overpowering amaretto flavor that it was very hard to eat. I was expecting a nice authentic Italian cheesecake. Didn't receive it.THE SERVICE:Horrible. The staff was so overbearing. It felt like I was being watched when I was eating my meal, so they could come clear the plates immediately. I was so angst in there that I was scared to ask the staff for some butter with our breadsticks. They made the environment entirely too tense. We were out of that place in 55 minutes.I do not mind spending money, in fact A LOT of money, on food if it is worth my time of course Food is my passion and my life. I seek out the best restaurants and make sure I wine and dine there. Il Mulino Prime was extremely disappointing and not to mention ridiculously overpriced.

However, the specials we ordered (without provided prices) were a joke!- The most offensive by far was the Dover Sole for ONE person for $75. Its a fish, and it was fine, but for one person??? The other fish on the menu were $32. How can they get away with that? It didn't even come with any sides or special preparation. - Burrata for $40! It was an average at best in terms of taste and serving size, and for $40!- Cocktails were $14 on the menu (which is standard for a place like this in NYC), 2 of which included ""Whistle Pig"" so my friend just ordered a Whistle Pig on the rocks. First, they tell us they don't have Whistle Pig (then why list it on the menu in several cocktails?) so they gave him another Whisky instead which we've never heard of... and then charged us $35 for it!! How is that ok?  - We asked our server for a bottle of wine that was below $100.  It was $140.  Nice surprise again.Service - We were greeted by the Maitre D scolding me for not confirming the reservation. Claimed he called 3 times and yet I never once had a voicemail. Nice way to start the evening. Then I ordered a dirty martini which they forgot, then when I asked again they brought the wrong drink. 3 times a charm I guess. Then I had to ask 2 times to get a wine glass for the bottle of wine our table ordered. Overall, just not the best and less than you'd expect at a restaurant of the caliber they think they are. Food - Not great. Steaks were good, a little fatty. My pasta was totally overcooked and mushy. Shouldn't a true Italian restaurant know better? Best dish was the Parpadelle appetizer. We left feeling totally taken advantage of with the outrageous  surprise pricing which was completely not warranted. I feel like they owe me a personal apology... and they should feel free to call me... they claim to have my number after all.",5,3,1,Whitney W.,"Manhattan, NY",0,9,8
