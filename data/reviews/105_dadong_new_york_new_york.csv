2.0,4/19/2019,"Food was good not great, but what really stuck out to me was the fast one that the food/drink runner pulled! I had ordered a dirty martini with Gordon's dry London gin ($13) and when the food runner brought my drink, she presented it as a ""martini, Blue Sapphire.""   I said, ""oh, I asked for Gordon's dry London."" to which she replied, ""Oh, we're out of that! Because of the holiday [Passover/Good Friday] we didn't get our regular shipments. Sorry!"" I figured that the drink would cost the same as a house gin.  Low and behold, when I received my check, I had been up-charged for a Blue Sapphire ($17).  When I passed the bar on my way out, I looked at their stock and in fact, there was a bottle of Gordon's sitting up there next to the Tanqueray and Blue Sapphire... We paid a lot of money for that food and the fact that they either (a) felt the need to up-sell me or (b) lied to me without knowing the facts about what was stocked at the bar, was just unnecessary.  In the end, it's only a matter of 4$ but by principle, it's shitty and shady business.",3,0,0,Bizzy C.,"Astoria, Queens, NY",1,7,1

2.0,4/6/2019,This might be the worst Chinese restaurant I have ever been to.  The waiter was very slow.  The gap between each dish we ordered was at least 30 minutes.  The food itself was not satisfying at all - small serving.  One of the dishes we ordered was pan-seamed pork and shrimp steamed buns.  I could probably make better buns by putting frozen ones from random Asian grocery stores into my steamer pot.  This place is definitely overpriced.  I could have had much better cuisine with half of that price.  I wouldn't recommend it at all.,0,0,0,Elicia H.,"New York, NY",188,2,0

5.0,3/25/2019,"To be honest, Da dong is trying very hard to bring Chinese cuisines to equal levels of top restaurants in the world; I can feel the ambition of the founder to present the best of Chinese food to us; however, this will be a long long journey as it is so deeply rooted in the minds of Americans that Chinese food is a fast and cheap go-to option for a full meal.When Da dong tries to integrate french style plating as well as pricing into Chinese food, the public becomes very sensitive and has an unfathomable, unreachable and unreasonable expectations for the food before they even set foot into the restaurant. This bias will persist and affect people's judgement on the true flavors of the food. As a result, people tend to subconsciously downgrade great flavors to mediocre at best. So I urge you all to drop your guard and try to enjoy the food when you come in, isn't that the purpose of us paying for the food? If we were the judge, then shouldn't we get paid instead of paying?I will provide comments on each food that I've tried later, but I do want to stress out one important point here. The ducks that Da dong use for roasting are to my guess domestically raised Peking ducks. Unlike the ducks you've tasted in China, which are force fed and therefore much more succulent, the U.S. raised ducks are much healthier but are also slimmer, and some people call it dry. Trust me, the ducks make all the difference. Force feeding is illegal in the United states, and Da Dong probably does not wish to import force-fed ducks from China. Comparing DaDong Newyork's ducks with DaDong Beijing's would not be so ideal.I truely believe DaDong can fight through this under-rated 3 star trauma, and one day become michelin starred.Jake",0,0,0,Yi X.,"Quincy, MA",0,8,1

Definitely felt more like a good place for a romantic dinner or a fancy celebration than a casual dinner. Food was okay in my opinion. My friends and I got the family style course.

2.0,2/19/2019,"I came here for restaurant week with my friend during a break between Harry Potter and the Cursed Child Part 1 and 2 nearby. Upon entering, DaDong looks super fancy with modern decor all around. We opted to sit at the bar and ordered different items so we could share and try a bit of each. Appetizers included the sweet and sour pork ribs (a bit too sweet for my taste, but the meat was tender enough) and the squid ink truffle soup (favorite of the night! The truffle is fairly prominent and the soup itself has great depth in flavor).For main entrees, we got the lobster with saffron rice and the chili diced short rib. The lobster was nicely cooked, but the rice was a bit bland. It is a lighter dish than the other options. The chili short rib was pretty good, though it didn't seem like short rib because some of the meat was either overcooked or a bit tough to chew. In any case, we ended up adding the chilis into the saffron rice to give it more flavor.We also ordered the avocado noodle in sichuan sauce (this was ok, good to try; I'm not sure if I would get it again) and added the $48 supplement of the half roast duck because... why not? Go hard or go home, right? We both thought the duck was a bit on the drier side. Not impressed.As for dessert, we got the tang yuan and the 'nata' custard. Traditionally, tang yuan is a dessert ""soup"" (sweet syrup) with rice balls made from glutinous rice flour. This one added tapioca pearls and a few other things in coconut milk. It was just ok for me. I've definitely had better, but I appreciate them trying. As for the custard, it legit looked like it was a fruit tart from a cheap Chinese bakery and not in a good way. We had no idea what was going on there, and we were completely disappointed with this one.Overall, not worth it. I don't feel an urge to come back. Service was also subpar. Water wasn't refilled at all until I waved someone down and mind you, we are sitting at the bar. THE BAR. Where the water is literally right there.",2,1,1,Corinna W.,"Queens, NY",581,251,443
5.0,2/17/2019,"I went there for dinner with my friends to celebrate Chinese New Year. The roasted duck was above our expectations after reading so many bad reviews. We liked it although it may not taste as good as what other DaDongs have in China. However, I do suggest the restaurant to increase food selections as some of the dishes are not so authentic, and may not cater to the tastes of authentic Chinese food lovers. BUT I have to say that the customer service there was exceptional. They comped us with two dishes (regular portions wow) because one of the dishes we ordered ran out. We didn't expect that at all. The servers were very friendly and patient and helped us take several pictures at the end. They were very professional and knowledgeable about their products as well. My friends asked the front desk about the fragrance they used in the first floor and the staff answered without any hesitations. At the end, a staff worked there asked us how to say ""happy new year"" in Chinese, and he wrote down the pronunciations in his notebook. He also took the elevator down with us and said goodbye, which was very heartwarming.

3.0,2/9/2019,My girlfriend is from China and we both enjoy Peking Duck very much.  She had been to Da Dong in Beijing and wanted to take me to the NYC location.  The atmosphere is very well decorated with a modern style in a beautiful Bryant Park building.  Cocktail offering was impressive and the drinks were very well mixed.  The service was terrific including the cutting of the duck in front of the table (as it should be).  The reason I'm giving 3 stars is because the Duck could have been a little warmer.  It's possible the air conditioning had something to do with it but by the time it was sliced and on the table it was only lukewarm.  It was still very enjoyable but compared to Decoy not as good.  Might still return in the future.,1,0,0,Garrett D.,"Jersey City, NJ",3,66,5

3.0,1/26/2019,"This New York outpost is a little off from the Beijing Da Dong where my bf and I went for my birthday several years ago and where we enjoyed the best Peking Duck ever.  The most curious addition in the beginning was a bowl of fried noodle crisps placed on the table which seems to be a nod to the silly Chinese-American restaurant tradition of serving a bowl of these noodle chips with a side of gooey duck sauce for dipping.  Were the chips there to remind folks that Da Dong is a Chinese-American restaurant even though they would not find anything remotely similar here to dishes of their childhood? The fried greasy tasteless chips are truly only a chow mein/chop suey restaurant phenomen dating back to mid century America and almost cheapens the epicurean experience that is about to come if you ask me. My bf and I have had quite a bit of duck in our day and had high hopes for Da Dong New York when it arrived in our midst. You can say duck is in our DNA.  I am Chinese and he is a Hawaiian Chinese chef so we know a little something about good duck.The pork and chive dumpling starter was tasty and plentiful.  I think there were 8-10 pieces in my appetizer.  They came in a bowl already drizzled with some kind of reduction but then was served with a vinegar dipping sauce as well.  This double saucing was not explained to me,  Our other starter, a Napolean salad was a brave attempt at creativity with what seems to be two fried open faced dumpling wrappers smeared with a tasty eggplant mash.  The taste brought me back to some kind of middle eastern dish I have had.  The star attraction Peking Duck here was crispy enough but a little tasteless.  There was a slight mealy mouth feel after eating the delicately sliced pieces suggesting the skin may have been treated with some kind of starch to get that potato chip-like crispy duck skin.  Our 1/2 SuBuNi duck was a supplement to the Restaurant Week prix fixe menu and I guess this is what SuBuNi is supposed to taste like: crispy but not too much (flavor).  The copious amount of hoisin sauce overwhelmed the very finely julienned cucumber, scallion and cantaloupe melon. My Lobster and Saffron Rice was spot on although a little confusing to me as to why it's on the menu.  I did not expect a dairy free al dente risotto topped with a perfectly poached petite portion of lobster with my Peking Duck.  My bf's Crispy Prawns were a respectable and a not-too-crazy version of the walnut shrimp dish that is on almost every Cantonese Chinese menu. It was good but not life changing.  The desserts were anti-climatic. My Tang Yuan soup was an odd combo of part tapioca, part tang yuan with a familiar but strange fruit loop cereal after taste.  The out-of-season pineapple bits were a little too tart and was a sharp contrast to the over sweet tang yuan soup.  Perhaps if the pineapple were cooked a liitle to sweeten the flavor, I would not have winced with my first spoonful. The Da Dong Nata custard was more puff pastry than custard with a gratuious fresh berry topping.  I wanted more Chinese egg custard but got what amounted to instead, an anemic creme brulee-esque croissant.  We were never offered or asked if we wanted tea with our desserts or meal which would have mitigated some of the extreme sweet and tart flavors at the end.  I don't think I'll be back even with Restaurant Week.  DD is off my bucket list.  New York Da Dong doesn't compare to my Beijing birthday dinner unfortunately.  I  so wanted to re-live our epicurean experience in China in New York but sometimes it's best to leave those memories where they are.",1,0,0,Wailana W.,"New York, NY",59,309,1103

Con: the duck is a bit too dry, even though the sauce makes up for flavor, the 松鼠桂鱼 is not sauced enough compared to the authentic one so it tasted more like the western version of orange chicken, the lamb portion is huge in the family meal after the fish and the duck so reducing the lamb would have been nice. upping the portions of the appetizers would have achieved the balance. FYI, we ordered scallion tofu, cherry champagne tomatoes, 三丝, and the sour cucumbers as additional appetizers to the family meal menu. The wagyu fried rice was terrible. It's dry and flavorless.

5.0,12/24/2018,"Dadong, translating from Chinese to ""big Dong"" in English, is a reference to the highly acclaimed reputation of Dong Zhenxiang, the Beijing-born chef and founder of DaDong. Already with many chain branches in China, the first U.S. restaurant of one of China's most famous and influential chefs, DaDong, is located at Bryant Park, bringing all the attention it deserves and showing its elevated status which calls for an amazing and definitely hedonistic experience.Walking through the plaza and up the steps, you will find the simple yet refined façade, with contrasting materials to draw in attention, especially its pair of formidably tall yet welcoming wooden doors. Upon entering through the held-open doors and greeted by the well-mannered host, the dim lighting, basalt walls with carvings, and all other details in their design shift you into a different state, one that is much more relaxing and comfortable, preparing you for the upcoming elevated experience. The upscale Chinese cuisine restaurant has a second floor with a rectangular bar, dining room, lounge space and an outdoor rooftop garden, which hosts live jazz music on Wednesday and Thursday nights. The third floor of the restaurant provides for a more faintly upscale environment for chef's tasting menus with regular dining rooms, private dining and an outdoor terrace to enjoy views of New York.The interior design showcases elegance and definitely a connection with its art, sculptures and the placements of many other details all resembling elements of nature, which do in turn help to create a calming yet dynamic atmosphere for a luxurious dining experience.Appetizers like the Salted Duck Egg Yolk and Rose Cake might seem simple, but they definitely hit the spot. The Scallop Sashimi, served with green apple jelly over a lemon with sorbet sided with edible flowers, is very refreshing. Imagine sitting in the hot summer weather, this would be the treat to have. The Braised Sea Cucumber and Braised Abalone with Italian Risotto are both delicious. The so-called slimy sea creature, after being perfectly braised, is placed atop young wheat grains and leeks, and sided with cucumber balls. Sea cucumber versus cucumber: the contrast of where they come from and their completely opposite textures; soft versus crunchy. The abalone, also cooked to perfection, has absorbed all sauces, making each bite into it, full of flavors and adding on to the richness of the risotto. And not to forget to mention, they freshly shave truffles in front of you onto this dish. The strong aroma of the truffles add on another layer of taste, leaves you wanting more.And how could one forget the famous DaDong ""SuBuNi"" Roast Duck, the Peking duck? SuBuNi basically means crunchy but never too much or enough. The duck is served with sides of sugar, garlic sauce, sweet bean sauce, scallions, thin strips of cantaloupe and cucumber, pancakes and crispy sesame buns. It can be eaten in four different ways; wrapped in the pancake, stuffed in the crispy sesame bun, just the crispy duck skin dipped in sugar, and the last; being the most extravagant, a piece of duck paired with a spoonful of caviar. The duck skin is roasted to create the perfect crispy skin with the right amount of fat and oil in each bite. The cantaloupe, cucumber, and scallion help to relieve some of the stress the skin might have accumulated on your taste buds before you continue.The Geoduck clams and Cherry Foie Gras are good cold starting dishes as well. The hot and sour scallop cappuccino is a great mixture hot and sour soup and cappuccino, with the essence of both still remaining. The Baked Chilean Bass is an aromatic dish, with all its flavors coming from the garlic, scallion, and peppercorn. The bass has a slightly crunchy exterior while the rest of its surface and interior are soft and tender.Even when it comes to dessert, there are plenty of options. However, the Dadong Nata Custards is a must! Simple yet so deliciously good, with the exterior crust being super crunchy and flaky and the custard is creamy and not too sweet.Whether you're having dinner in a private dining room, at the bar, outdoor terrace, or rooftop garden enjoying live jazz music, it does not change how great the food is. Chef Dong does just that, giving a great artistic and poetic twist to his idea of Chinese food and cuisine, transforming usual dishes into transcendental culinary creations. Shown in many of the dishes, there is the technique of molecular gastronomy used to help introduce a new flavor or ingredient to help enhance the overall plate in design aesthetically and in taste.",3,1,2,Tom L.,"Brooklyn, NY",128,129,935
2.0,12/21/2018,"Went for NYC Restaurant Week DinnerFood - 2/5. The edamame and peanuts had nothing special going for them tasting like they were just boiled in salt water. The endive duck treasure had a good kick to it, but didn't have much flavor past that. The ducks themselves weren't as tender as I expected but it was hard to tell when they are diced down as they were. Abalone rice was alright; the abalone and rice had a nice bite to them but the aromatics were plain. The egg custard had good sweetness to it and smooth texture but the lack of sauce and naked fruits drizzled around the plate was disappointing.Service - 2/5. The host was nice but the server had a consistent vibe of ""hurry up and leave"" with his constant reminder that we must vacate at a certain time. I understand the needs of a business but there are better ways to communicate to paying customers. Very unprofessional.Value - 1/5. When the prices are marked so high, you create certain expectations for the quality of food, service and technique of the menu items. I was disappointed in all three categories as the food was very simple in flavor profiles and execution. To charge such high prices and then sprinkling plain cut fruit for a dessert is unacceptable.

3.0,12/1/2018,"If you work in the area and you want a nice relaxing rooftop cocktail after work at a more upscale place, then this is a great spot. The atmosphere is great and draws a more professional crowd on a weeknight. I really enjoy coming here for an after work cocktail.However, I ate here for a client lunch and I was extremely disappointed. The restaurant is beautiful so that was a plus. However, the service was extremely slow. Also, the food was not good at all. We ordered a bunch of food and none of us liked any of it. Not to mention it's pretty expensive. The only thing I enjoyed was the fried rice. We got the Whole sole, stir fry duck treasures, Kung Pao chicken, short rib, and the braised eggplant. None of it was really good. Maybe their more signature and simple dishes are better because we did enjoy the fried rice. The bill came out to 250 for 4 people including tip. And we didn't order any alcohol! Luckily I didn't have to pay the bill with my own money or I would be way more upset.I also want to point out that the eggplant we order to go, for someone back at the office. We waited about 15 minutes after we paid the bill for the eggplant which we had told them in the very beginning of the meal that we needed it to go. I think they forgot which was weird because literally no one else was in the restaurant at that time. When we did finally get it, it was literally a small piece of sliced eggplant soaked in what can only be described as a balsamic sauce. With NO side. Nothing. It was just thrown into a White Tupperware. We brought it back to our colleague who had to throw it away because it was inedible.So to sum up, this place does have potential because it is a beautiful restaurant and it is good for happy hour.

3.0,11/26/2018,"I've actually been to two locations in Beijing over the last two years, and couldn't wait for this location to open. Sadly, many of the dishes didn't make it over, as one of the waiters told me that many of the menu items weren't selling at all, and some were a bit too difficult to execute properly, at least as the restaurant gets its footing. It's NYC, so I know some dishes will just be expensive, but two of the beef dishes were over $30 and over $50 depending on your choice of Wagyu or Kobe beef, and either one was literally 4 bites worth of food. The Kung Pao chicken, on the other hand, was a bit more reasonable at $22, and while a little on the small side, a perfectly executed dish.

The squid ink tofu soup, vegetable buns and the duck treasuries were great. The duck skin was crispy but not that oily. Many people don't like this style but I like it. The pancakes with the duck were authentic. I forgot to take photos for duck and pancakes. The problems are: 1) the duck was cold as we ate outdoor; 2) The cabbage dish and foie gras were hard to judge...; 3) The stir fried short rib and abalone were so disappointed as the sauce didn't taste good...Chilean sea bass was tasty though but a little overpriced.

Thumbs up for the chef who can maintain the high standard and the unparalleled control over flavor & texture & timing.  The five star is for the service and the perfect food.Their Kung Pao dish is what a Kung Pao dish meant to be, and honestly no other restaurant in New York meets this standard. Even in China, it is not that easy to find such a perfect Kung Pao that has the right flavor & color & cooking time, with absolutely no residual grease on the dish. Not to mention the scallion beef and the seared cabbage were also a must try.Do not understand where all those bad reviews come from. I almost got fooled but glad I decided to try it myself.

5.0,11/8/2018,"What a wonderful surprise that NYC has this restaurant. Their preparation of Peking Duck is slightly different than its original location in Beijing but still exceptional and clever in its presentation and enjoyment. While a shame that they don't do the bone broth currently, I have to say we enjoyed the service and ambience immensely even with a young infant with us. Their duck preparation is the best I've had. What authority do I have to say this? I've tried the duck in NY, Chicago, LA, Denver, China, Taiwan, and Macau. This one has the skin that is SINFUL. Dip it in sugar. IT'S DECADENT. The meat is moist and tender. The accompaniments were great. We already know how to assemble the pancakes, so I can't speak to how helpful the wait staff is about that. But I can say we had one of the nicest experiences at this restaurant. For all those who haven't, I would urge you to try again. This level of skill is incredibly difficult to find outside of Beijing (let alone other cities in China). I can't wait to come back to the city just (JUST!!!) to eat here again.

Nada. Took him over 30 minutes (yes I timed it) to cut one Duck. I wanted to pull up my video from a Chef at Quan Ju De in Beijing to show him how it's done. All the other dishes?Cherry fois gras? All show. Meh.Crispy Fish? Too salty. Braised eggplant? Mush. Beef? Pass.Wine? Well they couldn't mess it up but it could've used a decanter at that price point. They didn't have one!

At first they sat us at a small table but when we asked to sit somewhere else, they were attentive and found us a nice place on the terrace.The food was unique and interesting. Everything tasted good-nothing too strong, too oily or greasy. I liked the way they presented the food and the flavors were pretty authentic. We ordered the lunch menu, the Beijin duck and the compo chicken. Both foods were paying for. I don't really agree with some of the negative reviews that I read. A lot of New York where standards and food quality is quite different. Also, I felt like because Chinese food is expected to be cheap, a lot of people were complaining about the price, but if this a French or even Japanese restaurant, would people give such negative reviews?

1.0,9/27/2018,"There are much better Peking duck places out there, even in the city. Ive been to Dadong in both Shanghai and Beijing so I had high hopes for this one. Came here one of the first weeks it opened and had the worst ""fine dining"" experiences of my life. Waitress knew nothing about the dishes we asked about and actually told us a dish had ""orange peels"" in them (I'm assuming she meant zest). The drinks we ordered had interesting names and came out looking like cheap $5 ""cocktails"" off a booze cruise (one of the drinks looked like they dumped dry ice on top, solidifying the entire top layer so I couldn't even move my straw). The appetizers were just ok and pretty bland and doesn't hold a candle to the versions in their other locations. Oh, and for the soup- they brought over empty soup bowls and after five minutes of us wondering why we were being served empty bowls, the server comes and pours out lukewarm soup from a metal pitcher. Appetizing. Onto their star attraction: the duck. We ordered the whole duck for two and I'll admit the skin was nice and crispy, but the meat was so dry, I should have just brought along some beef jerky to replace it and would have gotten more flavor. Far cry from their other locations. Also, traditionally Peking duck places offer you a few options to how you want the rest of the duck you ordered prepared. When I asked about this, they told me that they couldn't offer the duck carcass because of ""safety reasons."" What kind of bs excuse is that? I asked them if they were afraid that I'll choke on a duck wing? They called over their ""manager"" who just reiterated that bs excuse and even the table next to ours joined in saying that we should at least be able to take the duck carcass home. After a bunch of back and forth I gave up and left with the worst Peking duck experience I ever had in my life.

We had 3 different cocktails and they are all delicious. Most of the dishes are decent. Foie gras was beautiful and tasty. Squid ink soup has good flavors. The duck is a little bland on its own, but with the sauce and etc, it's not bad. Pepper beef has good flavors and very tender but I always think it's a shame to have a good cut of beef not on the rare end. Abalone with farro has good flavors but I've definitely had better abalone. Song Shu fish is a big fail. The batter is way too thick. The earthiness of the fish is unbearable to me. We also had the rose cake which is a mini mooncake with rose petal filling. Quite different and interesting.Final verdict.

My experience at Da Dong was an absolutely an unbelievable experience, but not in a good way. As a rather new citizen of New York City I have come to expect a certain level of service/quality of food from Manhattan restaurants. After looking at the menu and the prices for DaDong I was honestly expecting to be treated, and dined like the queen. The entrance of DaDong is bizarre. You have to take up an elevator to the 2nd floor where the restaurant is. You arrive next to a strange hostess stand that looks out of place and wait. A man in a suit who I had no idea worked there(I thought he was the person we were meeting for lunch) and we sat down. I didn't get a hot towel. We weren't offered drinks. With the exorbitant menu prices you would think there would be some type of palate cleanser or anything to start the meal. Fast forward I had a cocktail that was very delicious. It was made with something called Salmon champagne which seems very bizarre to me. Half of me thought it was going to taste like fish, thats how strange the menu was. We ordered lunch. I got the salad with smoked salmon and the kung pao chicken. The salmon salad looks like the salad you get with lunch at a sushi restaurant for $2, but this was gross. It tasted like it was dressed in salt water? Virtually inedible. The fish was awful. The kung pao chicken was so spicy. Again absolutely inedible. There were maybe 30 habaneros and other peppers. So spicy I couldn't eat it. Our waitress never asked how it was. The chicken was fatty and seemed like it was just tossed in the sauce?

Are you just being a hypocrite as a Director of Operation at Dadong or this is the culture of Dadong team? As a team leader you should be the role model to take the responsibility and the action and to investigate or being critical-why my customers would feel in that horrible way after spending over $100 dollars dine at our restaurant? Why my customers would be motivated to spend the precious time writing a review? Why my team would make my customers feel negative? How could we improve the customer service and experience to grow as a genuine artisanal brand? How can we as a well-known brand can simply make people happy through the joys of food and attentive restaurant service? Sadly, you as a Director and team leader you don't have that professional mindset and people-oriented heart to represent a cultural restaurant brand and serve the people who are willing to spend money at Dadong to experience the greatness of Chinese food culture, hope you can understand what the whole point of replying a google review for the customers, and hope that the owner of Dadong didn't expect you to solve the problems in this unprofessional way.

3.0,8/26/2018,"Invited by friends from Beijing to have dinner here. He loves DaDong Beijing and would like to try it at New York. We ordered everything that resemble Beijing dishes hoping to fulfill our stomach's homesick cravings. Beijing dusk is never my favorite but it always reminds me my childhood in Beijing.  Many people don't like ducks raised in US farms, but I like lean meat better. I'm impressed with the way they present each dish, very creative! Overall, Some of their dishes such as salty duck egg and cherry foie gras are quite interesting but some of them are too dry to taste good like the the beef friend rice and eggplant! The white chocolate shell desert is very disappointing.",2,0,0,Sonia H.,"Rye, NY",202,41,195
2.0,8/25/2018,"To be fair, the duck is not bad. HOWEVER, everything else is terrible. Just go to Decoy instead if you want Peking duck.1. Our waiter tried to teach us how to eat Chinese food with the wrong information (e.g. eat appetizer first, then staples, then duck). I've never heard that ever in any other Chinese restaurants or in China. 2. The veggie dish we got was uncooked (raw chestnuts)3. The dessert looked amazing but tasted so weird and awful4. The first floor seating design didn't really make sense. Our table was so close to the bar that there were people literally standing right next to our table and pointing at our food while sipping drinks.STAY AWAY.

1.0,8/22/2018,"This place is a joke. Probably the worst Chinese food I've ever had in my entire life it's not even funny. I barely have review places unless they are so bad that I feel scammed. The portion for all of the dishes were tiny. Two bites and they were gone considering the high price. The fish was not fresh and full of batter. The Peking duck was barely any for a whole duck, and the wrap was very thick for the duck and for the pork buns. Do not come here...you will regret it. Overpriced for the size portion and quality. This place is for people to hang out outside, listen to music and order drinks. Not for the food. Straight up garbage.",3,1,1,Kyle H.,"Manhattan, NY",129,2,2
2.0,8/20/2018,"Three words: Not Worth It.We came here for lunch and got a whole duck, the sea bass, and a few other dishes.My roommate had raved about Da Dong since he loved the one in Beijing so we decided to come try out the first branch to open up in the US.We knew this was going to be on the pricey side but thought that it would be worth it considering how people loved DaDong in China.The decor is very modern and definitely upscale. It's located at Bryant Park which probably doesn't help with lowering costs.The service was okay. Nothing to write home about but it was inoffensive. No one really went out of their way to make us feel welcomed but no one got punched in the face either so I guess it's a wash.The food was mediocre. The Peking duck was very lean but tender and the skin was crispy, which are all the things you want in Peking duck, except the meat had ZERO flavor. I'm not sure whether it's because they picked ducks that have zero gaminess - to appease the mainstream American crowd - or whether the seasoning was inadequate, but it just tasted flat. I could have been eating chicken or turkey for all I knew.The sea bass was good but there was only one small piece per person, a pitiful portion.Other dishes were not memorable.We ended up paying around $60-70 per person and I have to say that for the amount of food we got, it REALLY wasn't worth it. A couple of us were still hungry by the end. The quality was just okay and surely you can get better at many other places in the city.This place seems like it's banking on rich people with deep pockets dining here on the corporate expense account. There are so many other negative reviews on Yelp (even some alleging racial discrimination by the staff???), I feel like I don't need to further repeat what has already been said. What I do want to point out is that the Manager, Celso Moreira, who has been replying to all the bad reviews here seems a bit disingenuous in his responses, like he's only replying so that people can't say he doesn't care. All of his replies are very cookie cutter and it's clear from what he says that they don't hold themselves accountable for any bad customer experiences. Just a ""Sorry you didn't like us. Come back soon anyways."" Not sure if he realizes this, but that's how he comes across.If you like good food and enjoy getting value for your money, I would steer clear of this place.Addendum: Check out this guy's reply to my review. Just like his other replies, he says he's sorry you feel the way you feel but takes no responsibility and makes no promises to change anything. ""We understand that not everyone will love our restaurant.""That's PR talk for, we don't cater to the likes of you and don't need your business.Also, my roommate raved about the restaurant in Beijing. He also disliked this one. The restaurant in Beijing has great food that caters to Chinese people.

1.0,8/6/2018,"****DaDong: unfair and discriminative service *********Ok...finally I decide to write this review and I want to let more people know our uncomfortable dinner at DaDong tonight.We were treated UNFAIRLY, and the service there is discriminative.Tonight, my fiancé and I came to dinner at DaDong and we sat in a corner with another table. Let's call our table A and the other table B. The two tables are very close to each other(less than 2 feet) and we share the same couch. Btw, table B is a WHITE couple and we are Asian. First, both of the tables ordered the roast duck. Our duck came first, the waiter just left the duck plates with different sauce on our table without saying anything. Several minutes later, the duck for table B were served. The same waiter came. To my surprise, he was very nice and patiently introduced the sauce to the white couple and told them how to combine the pancake with the duck/sauce. On the other hand, we were just completely ignored. Seriously, why didn't we get any introductions? Are we supposed to know the sauces and everything since we are Asian?Later, another uncomfortable thing happened. Over the dinner, the waiter patiently checked table B 3-4 times asking the white couple how everything is/if the food is good, whereas we were sitting 2 feet away and no one asked a SINGLE time how we were doing. The same waiter NEVER checked in with us and we were just completely ignored. it's particularly uncomfortable because we were so close table B -- I was literally sharing the same couch with the lady at table B. It's not like the waiter can somehow miss us. So I guess the waiter believe us Asian don't need any service?If the service is bad to everyone, we will just feel ok and won't be upset like now. However, DaDong treated customers so differently and this made us really disappointed.In the end, we didn't get any apology from the waiter himself. We will share this story with our friends who work in the media and let more people know the discrimination in DaDong (what a shame!)",18,5,3,Connie W.,"Arlington, VA",34,6,5
5.0,8/6/2018,"I don't get why this place has so many negative reviews. I came here with my friends to try out the restaurant week menu. As Asians that grew up in different parts of China, we all think the food was in general not bad.5 stars for my restaurant week experience, and probably 4 stars for the regular dining because the Beijing location set the bar too high. What I like: RW makes this place $$$ instead of $$$$. So definitely come with your friend so that you can order some add on dishes like the famous roast duck or wagyu fried rice. All dishes are FLAVORFUL and well executed with good presentations. Some little touches are even amazing. What I think can be improved: 1. Portion - kinda small if you don't order the add-ons for the RW menu. 2. The duck treasure appetizer is a mouthful of cumin. 3. The vinegar jellies in the lobster saffron rice really confuses me. As many people pointed out, they are way too sour, which kinda overpowered the nicely cooked rice and the subtle (but not bland) taste of the broth used for the dish. Bottom line: if you want some fine dinning experience for Chinese food, give Da Dong a try.

The restaurant itself is nice - decor, atmosphere, etc. but the food and service was too off. Service was too patronizing, almost as if the staff knew the food was not going to impress and tried to make up for their tip by asking if there's anything they could help with countless times. I don't want to even get started with the food, just read all the other reviews - unauthentic, small, and poorly executed. My question is. With all the horrible reviews since it's inception here and with the director of operations acknowledging every review, why is the food still so bad? Can not relate, why doesn't anyone doing anything about it ??? A disgrace to our culture and Beijing is what this restaurant is.",2,0,0,Benji P.,"San Diego, CA",30,2,0
2.0,8/3/2018,"Alright, so I've been to DaDong in China and I was really hoping the negative reviews were people's personal vendetta against paying a lot of $$ for Chinese food or people that blamed the staff for situations that weren't under their control but alas, no the food is actually just very mediocre.Service was great, everyone in the front of the house were friendly and courteous. It looked like it was busy because of Restaurant Week but it was all managed well. Also $20 for a wine pairing for each of your 3 courses in the Restaurant Week menu is a pretty good deal.Things Recommended from Summer Restaurant Week 2018- Squid Ink Soup if you like truffles- Lobster Rice for a filling meal- Egg Custard Tart (dan tat)As for food:4/10Cherry Foie Gras - You're just eating essentially butter and a piece of fruit with a pit in the middle. Nice bite of smooth, creamy foie gras, and plated very uniquely but it's not a very balanced dish. You're supposed to eat it, I assume, with the fresh cherries on the plate but it doesn't feel complete. There's no crunch, or sauce element, which is too bad because the quality of the foie gras really did seem good. 6/10Squid Ink Soup - One of the better dishes. Warm and good truffle taste with the thin tofu strands. I had ordered the foie gras but if I could do it again I would gladly get this instead. 1/10Pepper Wagyu Steak It would have been better not to call it wagyu and just say it's a piece of steak. Because I've had wagyu steak and this meat was so tough + dry. The center was also barely pink. I've accidentally microwaved proper wagyu steak before to a brown color and it was still soft as butter so I'm not buying it that this was what they say. It's also a tiny piece of steak on a huge bed of stir fried peppers. Not bell peppers, chili peppers with seeds still in them. So basically 75% of the plate was inedible. 1 point because if it was better quality meat and cooked properly, the flavor around it was pretty good.7/10Lobster RiceOverall cooked well. Everyone enjoyed it, liked how the rice was cooked.0/10Half Peking DuckSo we arrive at the star of the show. The thing they're known for and one of my favorite dishes ever. And. It was dry. I've eaten at DaDong in China before and it was one of the most memorable meals ever. This was just so... tragic. The duck was tough and dry. I've had better duck meat from Vanessa's Dumplings. I can understand that maybe the quality of the meat might be different in China than in the US, like you can't get the same quality chickens here. But I've had better duck at dingy Chinatown places in NYC so there's no excuse.10/10Egg Tart The best part of the meal. Crust was crisp/fluffy but still a little chewy and noticeably more savory than other dan tats that I've eaten. Filling was perfect with a little bit of char on top. That stuff was gobbled up in a second and we would all gladly eat more.8/10Tangerine Ice CreamThe name is a bit deceptive. It's more like... egg custard ice cream with candied tangerine peels. The ice cream if eaten by itself tasted like egg custard. But if eaten with the slivers of candied tangerine peels, the flavor becomes solely tangerine. My grandmother really liked the peels though she didn't care for the ice cream, which was fine because I liked the ice cream by itself.Overall I can sort of understand if a restaurant was stingy on Restaurant Week offerings, but both the RW menu items and their signature duck was pretty terrible in quality. It's not a person's prejudice against Chinese fine dining or a fluke in uncontrollable external issues that resulted in bad service. The food just isn't good.",2,0,0,Ellen S.,"Manhattan, NY",275,27,33

1.0,8/1/2018,"DaDong was entirely mediocre, which is unacceptable given the cost and reputation.We came here for restaurant week since we had heard of the restaurant through word of mouth. My first impression was the restaurant looked stylish and modern. However, it was all down hill from there. AppetizersWe chose the cherry foie gras and tomato mushroom salad. The presentation of the cherry foie was great (real and imitation cherries on a plate), but the flavor was too rich as there weren't enough cherries, and the dish came without bread. I asked our waitress for bread but she gave me a strange look, stating they didn't have any bread. Okay fine I get that it's a Chinese restaurant -- but then, during our main course she literally brought out bread and pancakes to eat with the duck supplement!! Tomato mushroom salad was decent. Main coursePortions are small. Almost inedible. The lobster rice dish was sour as hell. Tasted like it had expired or something. Wagyu was difficult to chew and hard. Peking duck was okay--in comparison to the god awfulness of the other dishes. The duck came out cold (probably because we waited over an hour). We also ordered the braised egg plant, which was okay but had a weird texture. I've literally had better eggplant dishes at random Chinatown hole-in-the-walls. DessertI'm convinced DaDong purchases old bakery egg custards and then just reheats them in the microwave to mask the taste. Enough said?

1.0,7/31/2018,"Disappointing. I came here with two friends after having heard it was good. It was restaurant week so we ordered both the restaurant week 3-course meal and an entree and two side dishes from the full menu because we wanted to try a variety of dishes. The food came out so slowly and and each course was more disappointing than the last. The first two appetizers were cherry foie gras and tomato stuffed mushrooms. The cherry foie gras was visually interesting since it was made to look like real cherries but the taste was underwhelming. The tomatoes were alright at best. The restaurant week menu main entrees we chose were slow cooked lobster and black pepper wagyu beef. The lobster was tough and chewy and was nested on a bed of saffron rice that was completely sour. It tasted like someone dropped the vinegar bottle in it by accident. The beef was tough and felt more like beef jerky than anything near wagyu. We also ordered the roast duck (of course) which was good but was cold when we got it and definitely wasn't the best roast duck in the city. The eggplant was also good I suppose but probably just because I was comparing it to the hard chunk of beef I'd just eaten. I can't comment on the zajiang noodles we ordered because there was a ""mix-up in the kitchen"" and we never got them. As for dessert the tangerine ice cream was alright but the nata custards (egg tarts) were soft and chewy like they'd been bought three days ago and microwaved. The custard inside was hot but the crust was a soft and gross. It was a waste of my time and money. I was still hungry after my meal and went to both Waffles and Dinges and Joe's Pizza.

4.0,7/22/2018,"We ordered à la carte the half duck, hot and spicy lobster, Beijing zhajiang noodles and braised eggplant. If you are entertaining a large party, you can opt for the Family Style menu with an eclectic combination of eastern classics with French luxury staples like truffled braised abalone and stick rice wrapped in iberico ham. But back to its main staple - Peking duck is a dish that originates from Beijing. Legends has it, it was a favorite dish of Empress Cixi during the late Qing dynasty. Preparing and cooking the duck is a painstaking process - starting from its origin, the ducks are bred just for this purpose to be plucked, seasoned and air dried for up to 70 days before being roasted right before it is served.Da Dong imported their own duck breed from China - in fact, they started their own duck farm in Indiana. Their breed is valued for their lean meat so that there are not much fat between the skin and meat. I wondered if there is a difference between China-raised ducks and American-raised ones. After all, its kind of strange to think of the ducks as being plucked from China and transplanted in America.Da Dong serves their duck with a mix of traditional and a modern twist - the obligatory spring onions, cucumbers but with an unusual choice of sweet melons to pick up the twang in the sauce. But their pièce de résistance is really the house-made hoisin sauce - made with over twenty different spices and soy sauces, it is more like a paste than a sauce, making it more viscous to spread on your pancake.Next came the lobsters - we got the pricier whole lobster with chiles (MP around $100), and then wondered to ourselves, ""Did they really need that much Szechuan peppers?"" Apparently, the answer is yes. The chef wants it to more like child's play, with the lobster poking out of the dune of peppers saying, ""Eat me if you can find the rest of me"", so you really have to dig through the entire plate to get your lobster. The zhajiang noodles were not as salty as I'd anticipated, but a palatable section of homemade zhajiang sauce with handpulled noodles, finely chopped celery and fava beans with microgreens on top. Though pricy for the amount (two small batches of noodles, while you can probably get three left bowls in Korea-town), it was filling.Finally, onto dessert. We got the Nata custards and the dried tangerine peel ice cream. While the Nata custard was great for the price (three for $12), I wasn't really impressed by the hue of this Portuguese egg custard. The finest ones should have a crème-brûlée like texture on top with nice burnt sections on top. But nonetheless, this was good to take home to enjoy for breakfast the next day.This was definitely an interesting twist on candied orange peels which you can find at a local Asian store - there was a dollop of ice cream on top of a crusty, nitrogen-infused ice cream crust on the bottom. They stuck a birthday candle on top which I gladly blew.Check out foodieprof.com for more details on DaDong!",7,1,1,Kelly W.,"New York, NY",148,22,344
4.0,7/21/2018,"I went with low expectation because I'd read the reviews here. Now after today's experience, I give 5 stars to its food (especially the roast duck and pan-seared buns). It is indeed a high-end Chinese restaurant that does not patronize people who are not familiar with authentic Chinese food.  So if you only order fried rice, spring rolls, or beef with broccoli whenever you go to a Chinese restaurant, then you won't appreciate this place.However, I decided not to give it a 5-Star rating because of how dishes are served. They are served one dish at a time like in a French meal. But Chinese dishes should be served at once (or at least whenever they are ready). It is awkward to have the same dish for 20-30 minutes and waiting for another dish. I use the word ""another"" not ""next"" because almost everything (except for the starters) should be served almost at the same time. Have a variety of dishes on the table is the signature of a Chinese meal.As to the atmosphere (music and decor), I have no complaints. The space is clean and pleasant.  Staff is polite and knowledgeable enough, but could have been a bit more attentive.",1,0,1,Peggy C.,"Manhattan, NY",8,59,74
4.0,7/20/2018,"Just to be clear, I think reviews of this place should be written and consumed with the proper context in mind. That means several things. It means that one should accept the following premises: 1) American Chinese food is terrible...for many reasons but one contributing factor is just that Chinese restaurants are forced to work with shit ingredients  2) Chinese food is normally cheap but could have high-end options and 3) Better décor and ambiance warrants higher prices. If you can accept all of these points, then you shouldn't be disappointed when you visit Dadong. The duck is crap because the ducks we have here are crap. The décor is lovely (except for the awkward porcelain ducks) and the service is on point. Some dishes are absolutely tiny but others (like the squirrel fish--relax, it's not actually a squirrel mashed into a fish...) are actually quite large. Just do your research and make sure you know what to order. We live in an age when you can google/sleuth virtually anything. You can't possibly show up to a place that has this many reviews and write a ""omg, but it was so expensive though!!!"" Don't be that girl/guy. Also note that there's a great mini-rooftop that you can enjoy given it's currently summertime. So quit whining and accept this place for what it is.",7,2,1,Henry Y.,"New York, NY",376,801,1
4.0,7/20/2018,"Overall I really enjoy the food and atmosphere, I think the food is well prepared, the quality is high, very tasty, has a little twist and give a little more imagination besides great flavor. I take one star off, just because the portion is very very small, so it is really expensive from that point view. Maybe just because I get used to the idea that chinese food is supposed to be cheaper. Still no complain as I appreciate they use good quality content, everything is fresh, and you can tell that they choose high quality meat and sea food, that is very important to me.The food we ordered:Geoduck clams, great flavor, the clam meat has the right texture, the meat is fresh, presentation is lovely, tiny portioncherry foie gras, half of them just cherry, so portion is even smaller, the flavor is good, nothing special, I order foie gras all the time in different restaurants, this is just another foie gras dish except that portion is even smaller. I don't think I will order it again.Stir fried duck treasures, this is so so delicious, so flavorful and I have to order it again and again. It is similar to traditional lettuce wrap, but is so much well done, tons of flavor, it is perfect to me, don't need to change anything.cold avocado noodles, the sauce is authentic and give a nice punch, but the portion is away to small, you can't  share it with anyone else, pretty much one chop stick can hold it all. I may not order it again, because you will get it in any authentic sichuan or hunan restaurant, same flavor, much bigger portion and much less money. So save money of it for something else here.half roasted duck, the portion is reasonable, not much fat, that I like, the meat to me is delicious, I can definitely say that they use good quality duck. The meat does dry fast, so eat it as soon as possible, don't let it sit on the table for long time. The wrap, I like it , very thin, healthier I guess, also I like the texture of it too. It gives nice hold but doesn't distract the flavor of meat and everything else. I am pleased with the dish overall, I think it is to me one of the best peking duck I have had in the city.The atmosphere ( 2nd floor) is alive,classy and upscale. I feel very comfortable, I can totally enjoy myself and also I can enjoy watching around. The service is good, not like wow wow, but acceptable.I plan to come back soon to try more dishes right after my visit, that is exactly the charm of this restaurant.

Service was terrible - the waiters  clearly had no idea of the food on the menu and when I asked him what exactly were the snacks in ""Beijing snacks"", he gave me sort of an attitude like I was fussy.

4.0,7/15/2018,"I came for lunch on a hot day - we sat outside under the umbrella and it was still a bit too hot. I love the presentation of the food and particularly loved the fois gra dish.MUST GET:cherry fois gras: ingenious. The fois gras is shaped in cherries, with a delicate layer of glaze on the outside and soft fois gras on the inside. I thought that it was going to be super rich and it turned out to be light and intricate. Absolutely adored this dish.  SOLID:Lobster cocktail - the lobster meat fell right out of the shell, super fresh. Spicy and sour cucumber - solid but not unique. The ribbons of cucumber on top adds to presentation but tasteless. mango ice pudding - interesting presentation. The mango cubes actually had the consistency of cheese. Refreshing for a hot day but not one of my favorite desserts. SKIP:Peking duck - we heard that this is the best Peking duck and ordered it. I was a bit disappointed. The dish was fairly heavy with a lot of skin. I was getting a bit too tired of the dish half way through (half duck shared between two people). The skin was cooked a bit differently than traditional style - less chewy but lacked structure and flavor.",6,1,3,Rebecca C.,"San Francisco, CA",679,839,2164
4.0,7/12/2018,"Having eaten at most of the top Beijing duck restaurants in Beijing, I was happy when Dadong announced that they were opening in New York.  Some say that Dadong is THE place for duck in China.  They prepare duck in the ""new"" style in which the fat is more fully rendered compared to the older style duck restaurants.  Some prefer the new style.  Some prefer the more traditional style.  Tonight was the first time I've had the chance to eat at the New York location.A lot of reviews complain about the prices.  A single duck goes for about $100, which may be too much for some.   Our dinner for 4, which included 1 duck, a whole fish entree to share and 6 smaller dishes came to a little over $500, including some beer and cocktails but no wines.I thought the duck was perfect and easily up to the standard of the mother ship back in Beijing.  The duck meat was tender and moist.  The skin was crisp with (in Dadong's signature style) very little fat.  They provided both pancakes and crispy ""buns,"" which were more like puff pastries, for wrapping the duck.  I generally prefer pancakes to buns and thought the pancakes were very good -- very thin but durable and not at all greasy.   The sauce was Dadong's usual customized version.  All the top Beijing duck restaurants have their own proprietary versions of the sauce, and choosing a favorite is just a matter of personal preference.  I like Dadong's version, as it's not as sweet as some others.My only complaint about the duck is that the duck was a little on the small side, but that's a minor quibble.We also shared the braised whole fish (sole) with blueberries.  The fish was cooked just right, and the flavor was terrific; but I found the sauce to be a bit sweet for me.We also had abalone with yams (terrific), lotus root in an overly sweet red sauce, something called ""duck treasures"" (a small duck dish served in individual rice noodle ""nests"" -- also terrific), foie gras ""cherries"" (very good with an interesting presentation), cauliflower with shallots and peppers (very good), and roasted eggplant (also a bit too sweet for me).  Clearly (as expected) the duck is the star here.  Everything else was very well done, though (as you can tell from my comments above) some of the smaller dishes were a little too sweet to my taste.  There are many dishes in China that seem too sweet to many Americans, so the sweetness doesn't mean it's badly prepared or inauthentic.  On the other hand, I suspect that many Westerners will find many of the dishes too sweet for their taste as I did, which may diminish their enjoyment of the meal.  I should also point out that I was the only person in our group who complained about the sweetness.There's an extensive wine list that we didn't sample, a small beer list that's mostly American brews, and a nice selection of cocktails.I agree with some of the other reviews that the service could be improved, but it wasn't bad enough to be annoying.  Nevertheless, at these prices, you'd expect a higher level of service.More disturbing was that almost every table in the indoor section where we ate seemed dirty.  The tabletops looked greasy to me, though the manager swore that it was just some film remaining from the cleaning fluid they use.  Whatever the reason, the tabletops looked unclean.  When I complained, they promptly re-cleaned all the tables, but it didn't leave a good first impression.The restaurant has been in business for long enough that you can't blame this on a period of working out the kinks in service.In the end I give Dadong 4 stars because the truly excellent duck compensates for the other deficiencies.",0,0,0,James B.,"Westfield, NJ",0,23,1

The ratio between skin and meat was perfect. The majority of negative reviews here are authored by diners who do not understand Peking duck. ""It's expensive""- $100 for a duck includes the cost for raising ducks on a farm that's not a factory farm, transporting these delicacies to the city, expertly cooking them for the perfect skin, and serving it with many sides. ""We could get the same in Chinatown""- The difference between Chinatown roast duck and Peking duck is night and day. Peking duck's star is the crispy, airy skin. Would order the duck at DaDong again in a heartbeat. We also ordered the sea bass which was divine. The sea bass is basically baked over a bed of garlic cloves which is kinda amazing.

We would not tell this is actually a Chinese restaurant if hadn't been for the Chinese in the menu and the duck-shape chopsticks holder. The service is very good.The appetizer cherry foie gras has an appealing presentation and the ""cherry skin"" has wine in it (for the color, I believe). I like the subtle taste both real cherries and those made of foie gras paste but my daughter could not appreciate them at all. What my daughter loves is the seared Napa cabbage - even though a bit browned at the tips, the crunchness and juice were still preserved, the subtle sweetness from the cabbage, the peas and the soybeans, even the fresh garlic dices, all went well together. The roasted duck was good, but did not appear to be freshly out of the oven and still sizzling hot as the authentic peking roasted duck is normally served.The dessert was a typical Cantonese mango pudding with a creative twist. It was not served liquidish, in stead, it was frozen into a mango shaped ice cone with mousse inside!Overall the food was delicate and more modern, which we like. The service was also very good.

As you could imagine, I was pretty psyched and booked reservation on the day of they open their reservation line. One day before my reservation, they said they are not ready for lunch (yet), wow, unbelievable. So Thurs after work, I over heard the beautiful live jazz performance on their lounge/patio area, I decided to let go my grudges and give this beautiful establishment a try.

5.0,6/10/2018,"Something is wrong with the people reviewing this restaurant.  DaDong is stellar, a beautifully designed restaurant with comfortable indoor seating, a wonderful outdoor patio/bar, great service and absolutely delicious food.Honestly, this place is as good as Hakkasan and deserves a Michelin star.  We had the lobster with saffron rice, the hot pepper beef short rib, and of course the peking duck which is prepared with a french culinary academy level of technique and perfection.  Their cocktail menu is absolutely on point including the ""punch for two"" option.  They could flesh out their sake list a little bit more, and the only thing that I would have considered a ""miss"" food-wise is that the chocolate leaf dessert really needs to have a scoop of espresso ice cream to fix the texture issue, but as long as you order it alongside the mango ice pudding, you're good to go.Perfect for a date night, perfect for a family style group dinner.  Delicious and I will absolutely be back.  You haters need to recognize this place for what it is, the highest quality Chinese restaurant in Manhattan alongside Hakkasan.",3,0,1,Chad T.,"Manhattan, NY",52,776,127
1.0,6/9/2018,"Worst experience ever. Waited more than an hour for all food we ordered served. Bad service attitude.  The food tastes awful. please don't ruin Chinese food like that. I heard this is a hrestaurant in China. Please do better. Update after the director's reply:it's a great place to spend time with friends when you are not very hungry. I don't think more than 1 hour is the proper waiting time for a restaurant. If I don't want to be rushed I will tell you. I asked to have my meals served after 40 minutes waiting, and your waiter just frowned at my requests. High end or not, you should not be the one to decide how long I spend on my visit there. Have to say everything looks perfect including the foods. But I guess as a Chinese I have a say on how the Chinese food you served taste like. I suppose you can afford better cooks since this is a $$$$ restaurant?",0,1,0,Wenchen A.,"Malden, MA",0,1,0
4.0,6/9/2018,"The first time we had DaDong was in Beijing and it became our must-go restaurant every time we stop by Beijing. We went to DaDong New York yesterday, and ordered the lotus, lobster & rice, Song Zi crispy whole fish and the roasted duck. The look and taste of each dish was definitely delivered however, the reason I gave one star less is that they need to make sure the duck is served hot as the first bite of the roasted Peking duck should be dipped with sugar and if it is not hot enough, you won't have the best melting in your mouth experience. The duck we had was tasty but it was warm/slightly cold. Overall, it was a great experience.

Very cozy and intimate dining environment, amazing view of sky in the mist of Manhattan steel forest, we are actually on a rooftop! DaDong now updated its summer menu selections, compared to its opening menus back in January, DaDong added more affordable and seasonal cuisines for customer to choose. We ordered dumplings, fish, fried shrimps, tomatoes, vegetable buns and dessert. We enjoyed the food and aura! Everyone's in the moment and happy.

I also like the roasted duck which is crispy and less greasy than other Peking roasted ducks, pretty authentic and unique. If you were not from Beijing, China, having Peking roasted duck here should be a must. For Beijingners like me I also recommend to try the duck here to get a special experience of eating.

2.0,6/5/2018,"I was very much looking forward to trying ""the best Peking duck in Beijing"" at DaDong New York.  Unfortunately, the excellent food was completely overshadowed by terrible service.The GOOD- Moist duck, prepared well.- Any lack of flavor in duck easily made up for by pancake and plum sauce setup.- Tasty staples.The BAD- Service simply isn't where it needs to be at this price-point.  $100 duck better be great, and the service needs to be impeccable.- High pressure sales pitch to order more food than you need.- Will seat you at a table that doesn't fit your situation.- Service EXTREMELY slow; waiters happy to ignore you for long periods of time.- Food comes out in random order on an extended timeline.- Restaurant is empty, and doesn't have much life.Details below...When DaDong first opened their New York restaurant, there was a months-long waiting list for reservations.  I guess all of those ""zero star"" and one star reviews must have taken their toll, because their reservation sheet was wide open at 8pm on a warm summer Friday night.The 400+ capacity interior had less than a dozen customers when we walked in at 8pm, and zero when we left around 10:30.  This made some sense, since it was a perfect 72 degrees outside.  What made less sense was the 200+ capacity outdoor area that was about half full, and there was a group of maybe 3 people at the bar.  Looked like a slow night, but I don't hold that against a restaurant, because you generally get more attention from the wait-staff when the restaurant is empty.  Wow, I couldn't have been more wrong.There were 4 of us.  We had a reservation.  The restuarant was half empty (ignoring the indoor area, which was completely empty).  The host brought us over to our table, which was a tiny wicker setup that looked like it was more suited to 2 people.  There were a few of the larger wooden tables free, but we thought that perhaps those were reserved for larger parties later (they weren't).  There were several open tables in the lounge area around the bar, but we decided to stick it out in the main outdoor dining area to see how things went.The waiter quickly came by with menus (the only ""quick"" thing that the staff did all night).  As he handed food menus to the group, there was nowhere to put the wine menu due to the tiny size of the table and the large footprint of the place settings already there (including plates, giant napkin rings, chopsticks, big double-duck-shaped chopstick holders, etc).  Eventually someone in the group was left with 2 menus, one in each hand, and no place to set them down.Soon after the menus, some cold wash cloths were brought to the table, which were nice but resulted in one more thing that didn't fit anywhere.Next, we were ignored for 20 minutes.  We were having a good conversation, so it wouldn't have been very noticeable, aside from the fact that we were still holding our menus or had them sitting in our laps.Our waiter seemed to be busy with another member of the staff poking at one of the service terminals a few feet away.  When he finally came up for air, we flagged him down so we could at least get our drinks order in.  While we had his attention, we asked him for his dinner menu recommendations.He recommended the duck and told us about the specials.  He said that the dishes were small, and told us that we should order one cold plate and one hot plate PER PERSON (along with the whole duck).  We asked him about some of the ""staples,"" which he said were good, but very small.  Hmmm, a whole duck plus 8 dishes seemed like a lot... how small were these dishes???15 minutes later our drinks arrived, and we used the opportunity to put our food order in (it was now about 40 mins since we sat down and we were getting pretty hungry).  We ordered the whole duck and 4 of the staples (dumplings, pork steamed buns, wagyu beef fried rice, and the Zhajiang noodles).  The waiter again stressed that the staples were very small and that we should order more food.  We thanked him for his advice, but stuck with our order.20 minutes went by and nothing happened.  Other tables nearby were getting their food, and we started asking ourselves whether they had arrived before us, etc.  We were hungry and getting a little cranky.  A few more minutes passed, and mercifully the plate of dumplings showed up.The dumplings tasted great.  The black colored vinegar was spread around the plate for presenation, and while we all could have used a bit more vinegar in the mix it all tasted pretty good.  A definite winner.This review cut short by yelp's review character limits, so let me do a quick summary with the space I have left.Lots of waiting; getting hungrier, tasty food arrives, eaten, ignored by wait staff, some more food arrives, etc.  You get the picture.  We were charged for ""extra"" duck accessories, since we had eaten some while waiting for the duck to arrive (no explanation from staff).",0,0,0,dylan c.,"Manhattan, NY",0,9,1
4.0,6/3/2018,"Very very yummy. The sizzling beef, wagyu beef fried rice, spinach, dumplings, avocado noodles...all so delectable I am so happy just reliving it and writing this review. The sauce in the avocado noodles was really superb, a must order (thanks to our server for the recommendation!). For the duck itself - I don't have a lot of experience with Peking duck but I really enjoyed it. Pancake style was my favorite. The skin was very rich and melt in your mouth level. Funny enough, there was a street fair in front of Bryant Park today and we got some Peking duck in a bao bun for a few bucks right after lunch just to try it. There is a definite difference - DaDong is worth visiting at least once! Definitely a splurge but I'd go again. Service was mostly excellent and was very friendly on a quiet Sunday afternoon (not very busy).",1,0,0,Nadia T.,"Manhattan, NY",29,131,10
5.0,6/2/2018,"This review is just for the outdoor bar area!I pass by DaDong on my morning commute and have always wanted to visit the outdoor seating area that overlooks the quiet public area just half an avenue west of Bryant Park. After work on a hot evening, I decided to stop by with a friend to grab drinks and I absolutely loved the outdoor space! Lots of wood frames with accents of blue and orange - perfect for a summer night. There are separate dining tables that overlook the public area, and lounge-like seating closer to the bar. We both ordered frosés (which were a little too sweet for me) and another round of wine shortly after. They have a wide selection of cocktails and drinks to suit your fancy, so there will be something for everyone.The staff is very friendly and attentive, and this place has almost an ~effortlessly romantic~ vibe. The mini pond (?) / body of water and big sculptures also cools you down by sitting near it. I will be back next time to try their food, as there were a few things on the menu that caught my eye. I know DaDong is a very famous restaurant in China and the expectations are very high, but perhaps the experience will be better for me since I have no other standards to compare to.

2.0,6/2/2018,"Overall Score: 2.5/5 I went to DaDong early in their opening, and had a wonderful time despite other negative reviews at the time. Unfortunately, my visit now paled in comparison. The Good: - I really love the space and ambiance. Great views and fun music with great decor. - Some dishes were really a hit. The wagyu fried rice, bass, and pea sprouts were stand outs. I love the presentation of their dishes, they really do pay attention to their presentation.The Not So Good:- The duck was terrible this time. Thick, unappealing skin with little crisp and little to no meat. As the focal point of the restaurant, the consistency of the duck must be addressed as last time I had a wonderful duck.  - Service was also a miss because they put everybody in one area of the restaurant served by only one waiter, which I found odd because there was so much free space in the restaurant. My tea was never refilled (and it was hard to flag down the waiter to ask for a refill). - The restaurant was absolutely freezing inside. Not sure why, but I had to bundle up to make it an enjoyable experience. - Desserts were subpar. Presentation was great as always, but the taste and flavor is lacking. Seems like the concept behind all the desserts were a miss. Overall, I would return if the duck issues were addressed. I still think DaDong is a fun place to hang out and order some great family-style upscale Chinese cuisine, but I might stick to other similar options in the city in this price range unless DaDong can work out their consistency issues.Food: 5/10Service: 4/10Ambiance: 7/10 Overall: 5.3/10",1,1,0,Brian B.,"New York, NY",171,19,26

The menu was extensive but not overwhelming, and our server Kyle, made all the right suggestions. I can't express enough just how great the food was, but also the presentation, how it was coursed out perfectly and it wasn't too expensive.

4.0,5/28/2018,"Update May 2018:Came back for a visit two nights ago. Celso had put together a special tasting menu for us - surprisingly, at least half of the courses were full sized entrees. Needless to say, we walked out absolutely rotund. When we came here in January, we had ordered the duck, the kung pao chicken, the cauliflower, among other dishes. These three were again presented to us this past weekend. I'm still not crazy about the cauliflower (very greasy) or the Kung pao chicken, but the duck tasted more flavorful this time around. Skin was crispy - very good with sugar. Still seemed smaller than half a duck, but I did watch the men slicing them about five feet away - without the innards, one whole duck could only be portioned into two ""half"" ducks. So they aren't shafting their customers in that regard. We were also presented with new dishes we hadn't tried - including a saffron rice with lobster and a baked Chilean sea bass with peppercorns and garlic. These two were easily the best dishes of the night. The lobster / saffron rice combo was truly indulgent - rice flavorful and lobster chunks chewy. The fish in the sea bass entree was melt in your mouth tender, and even the garlics were buttery / melty. Most importantly, peppercorns were not overwhelming. On my next visit, these seafood options will most certainly be our go-to dishes. We had both the mango dessert and the white chocolate seashell finisher. I'm a huge fan of quite chocolate, but wasn't a huge fan of this dessert. Not sure if the chocolate is made in house or not. Mango dessert was refreshing - preferred that instead. Very cool presentation for the mango (read: instagram worthy). Experience was significantly better overall this time. Robert was our main waiter. He was exceptional from beginning to end - explained the ingredients in the dishes, checked in with us closely, brought out fresh plates every two courses or so. Always had an upbeat attitude, attentive to my husband's allergies, and always accessible. Glad we gave dadong nyc a second chance. Thank you for the lavish evening. We will be back.*******************************Update February 2018:Updating this review, primarily in response to the director of operations forcing me to reevaluate my originally generous THREE star rating. 1. I've read your canned response to numerous negative reviews. If the average / majority / median rating is TWO & A HALF stars, that indicates there is something off with your business model. The most obvious here is price point to overall dining experience (inclusive of taste). The very recently published NYT article echoes sentiments of all these negative reviews. 2. Please explain how ""if you don't like what you ordered ask the wait staff for dish suggestions"" works. Why should I have to pay additional for a new plate, and endure additional waiting time, if the quality of the very basic (and staple dish) Kung Pao Chicken is so subpar at your restaurant? What if I just really wanted to eat Kung Pao Chicken that evening, and did not want a substitute but instead wanted my chicken to taste",3,1,1,Sharon L.,"New York, NY",212,118,204
2.0,5/26/2018,"I have to say I am not a picky person at all. I can give Two stars as the most I can offer. Let's be straightforward: 1. Food. 3stars / Servers: 0 stars / Environment: 3 starsFollowing is the detail:A. The interior design and decoration feels about money but far away from the elegant and the spirit of Chinese/Eastern aesthetics. B. The quality of the tableware feels cheap.C. The layout of the dining area on the terrace is crowded. D. The teacup and teapot are cheap. E. The waiter took the black tea out of the teacup and left on the table, and then he ignored it for more than 10 minutes. So the tea leaves were not suitable to drink anymore. We have to ask for a new one, but the waiter questioned our correctness and tried to teach us how to drink a Chinese tea...this was so ridiculous since I am a Chinese. Then we asked the waiter to add hot water to the tea. But it took more than 10 minutes to do this simple job, and we have asked him twice. Untrained people for serving Chinese tea for sure! F. The duck is good. But the skin fat( a small but most tasty piece) is supposed to be put aside from another part like what they do in China. Also the waiter should tell people how to eat that(only with sugar) and don't let it be cold. The pancake is too cold.G. The sea cucumber is good.

3.0,5/25/2018,"Food was fine, but the service was SHOCKINGLY bad. For the price we pay to dine, we should be receiving a white glove dining experience, but unfortunately, we we encountered a series of service faux pas:1) When we arrived, we asked to be seated on the third floor, not on the second floor which was really warm and humid. It also has a much more informal vibe (high top lounge chairs), which my parents did not like. The host told us the 3rd floor was closed for a private event, but when we took the elevator upstairs at the end of our meal, there were 2 tables of diners and a dozen of open tables. Not sure why we were lied to...2) After getting seated on the second floor, there was confusion about who was waiting our table. Two different waiters took our drink orders, but nobody came to get our food order. We had to ask twice before we could put in an order for food. 3) The European waiter kept trying to clear our dishes before we were done with our food. We had to literally take plates out of his hand, so that we could serve ourselves the remaining portions. He tried to take away our fish even though the head was still on it.. hello, that's the best part! 4) No help with serving anything. There were very large dishes like the whole fish that was left on our table with no way to serve ourselves. No service spoons. No help from the staff to cut and plate fish for us.5) We had to proactively ask for plate changes. Typically in Chinese cuisine, the wait staff will offer to change your plates 1-2 times during the course of the meal. After 4-5 dishes, our plates were swimming with different flavors and sauces, and we had to ask our waiter for a plate change. Unfortunately, he tried to clear my mom's plate while she was still eating one of the steamed buns, and DROPPED it on the floor. He promised to get her a replacement bun, but he never did.6) We ordered a full peking duck that never came. It was only until they bagged our leftovers to go, wiped our table down, and cleared our plates that we knew they had completely forgotten to serve us a $100 dish. When we reminded them, they quickly plated the duck in front of us. Unfortunately, I was too stuffed by the end of our meal to fully appreciate the most important and expensive dish we came for. In Chinese banquets, the expensive delicacies are served first, so that guests can enjoy them with empty stomachs. Rice, noodles, and buns are always served last since they are cheaper, quicker ways to fill you up. This felt like a complete oversight.Overall, my biggest suggestion to management is to re-train your entire staff on the fundamentals of good service. We were expecting asian hospitality and this fell so short of our expectations.

5.0,5/23/2018,"I've dined here 4 times since they opened and is going again tonight with a large party. Honestly I don't think the current 3-Star Yelp average is doing them justice and hopefully I can ease some of the concerns people have had since the opening.My first time here was shortly after the opening. Before going I already noticed the bad reviews on Yelp about the bad service & long wait between dishes & cold food etc. I think the reason was they wrongly estimated their capacity and have too few service staff maybe? One thing they did (which again caused a lot of bad reviews but in my opinion was the correct thing to do) was to cancel all lunch reservation. I think by doing that you got more time and energy to focus on the preparation on the food, which is eventually the most important.Back to my first visit. We were seated in no time and everything was smooth, from ordering to serving. The food was far above my expectations. I visit DaDong in Beijing every time I go back home, and I think the taste is very similar. The menu is only a selection of the DaDong Beijing but I think it covered majority of their signature dishes. The only complaint was the pancake for the duck. It was way too thick and didn't taste like the homemade pancake back in Beijing. Fortunately they already fixed that. Since then I've dined here several times more, and they didn't disappoint. Some highlights including:- the Peking duck obviously. The taste is a bit stronger than in China but I think this is the closest thing you can get in nyc to an authentic Peking roasted duck. I've tried different places here in nyc, including Decoy or Hakkasan, and I still think DaDong is the best;- Squid soup. order this if you are into truffle taste- Geoduck clams. Portion is small but great taste- Steamed king crab. This is the only thing I've yet to try here in nyc. This dish is VERY good in Beijing and I hope they can replicate.- Chilean bass. We order this EVERY TIME- Beef. Last time we tried the seared wagyu and it was really good. In previous visits we tried the beef with chili & pepper and I liked it a lot.Honestly I can list much more since I've tried a lot of stuff on their menu, and I can't remember a single dish that makes me feel bad. I'm not saying they are perfect, but they are a good high end Chinese restaurant in midtown. It's worth a visit if you like Chinese food.",1,0,0,Ryan G.,"Jersey City, NJ",6,23,15

It is very expensive. I found the peking duck delicious and I love that they use the pancake skins (what I was used to growing up) instead of the buns. The duck skin was more like cracklin' and the accoutrements included both the standard fare, as well as some new (to me) items thrown in. The service was very attentive although they did lack some grace clearing empty dishes/napkin holders (guy lunged out of nowhere). One thing.

The spicy big lobster dish was delicious n I love the spice, we had truffle n tofu soup. Superb, though I wish it used a different color bowl for serving.  We had sea cucumber to be eaten with rice. The sauce is simply outstanding. Then the Peking duck. Hey difficult to get Peking duck better than the one we had. The biggest surprise for us was indeed the desserts. We were delighted with all the four desserts we ordered. Each is superb. So rare to see such fantastic desserts in a chinese restaurant.

3.0,5/18/2018,"Finally, I dined at Dadong in New York. I probably will return, reluctantly because of, I'm from Beijing, their duck is good, the decor is nice. At the moment, they may be the only high-end Chinese restaurant in town (Tse Yang @  34 E 51 St closed about 10 years ago; Mr. K's at 570 Lexington closed too ... those so-called high end needed to be shut down, making room for the newer ones. Buddakan & Tao, and the like are under the name of Asian or Asian fusion...). I heard from a friend that the majority owner of Dadong is from Hong Kong, and Dadong itself holds a minor stake.The entrance is from a yard. Their interior decoration is pretty good, not as tacky as their many branches in Beijing. They have an extensive wine list, with nice wine glasses - thin stems and light. This 2014 Pinot Noir is from Domaine Fourrier in Bourgogne/Burgundy, France - where they produce Burgundy wines, also the pinot noirs and Chardonnay, Chablis and Beaujolais. The sommelier said this wine is allocated to them - which brought me to think of food rations 粮票 ha ha.The service. It's good but inflexible: when our server kept on asking if there is anything he can do for us, that makes me wonder how can't he judge if we need him or not? More training, perhaps? I do miss the good old boys at the steakhouses who just knew when or what a customer needs. A girl came to take our order, lectured without any regards that all food should be shared ... Don't I look like a Chinese? Thank heaven they didn't try to teach us to use chopsticks. Then funny enough, after my friend order this wine, the sommelier switched to French but when my friend replied in excellent French - yes Americans are known to have no second language - he then switched back to English.We were running 45 minutes late but called ahead. When we got there, were seated immediately, to the third floor. The first/ground floor is just a reception desk with a single girl manning it. The second floor is the bar, pretty noisy. The small dining hall on the third floor is very quiet, with one couple at the table near the elevator. Oddly enough, the usher wanted to seat us on the first table to the elevator, next to them - what was she thinking? By the time we're done, the hall only added two more tables with six people in total - I asked for the table at far end. ""Fine,"" she said and then led us over. When we were just about to sit down, a staff came, ""oh, no. This table is unstable."" As the leg was broken. Emmm... they've just opened last November, and the unstable table is nicely laid out with tableware. It was so close to us, I had to ask them to move it away from us a little, avoiding knock over unintentionally by me.The food. The freebies, edamame (ends cut - detail, very good) and boiled peanuts are good choices. Tufu with scallion, water chestnut 马蹄, pea sprout 豌豆苗 and zhajiangmiao (noodles) 炸酱面 are good.The duck is good, they sell half too.The pinenuts fish and dumplings have been cooked long before they were served - I liked how they pace the food but that doesn't mean the chef should cook so far ahead, and let the food sit around. The fish wasn't crisp. One look at the dumplings I knew they were toward cold - see the sagging skins, and the fillings are ok but could be a little less fine/fussy. The dumplings were topped with alfalfa sprouts - totally not necessary. Two dumplings are broken, come on, this is so basic!Some diners on the other side were overly loud for this type of environment - remember, it's a Chinese eatery, with many Chinese - not something the restaurant could control. Nice music but could tune down a bit.All in all, I think Buddakan is better, not that many issues I could think of.And another basic question, where are my duck bones? I ordered half, there still should be half of the bones, right?",3,3,2,Irene E.,"Great Neck, NY",141,242,1391
3.0,5/17/2018,"Checked in DaDong today.  I have to say 3 stars reflect the right you will get.  First the Duck, it's not as good as I expected.  It's a little bit dry.  I Guess it's because of no right Duck in the US, so they have to compromise.  But good thing is the skin is crunchy.  In short, the roast duck is the best what I had in the US so far.  As a Beijinger, I always can't find an authentic Peking Duck in the US, but DaDong can be near to my standards.Cherry foie gras: The taste is as good as it is in Beijing.  The downside is the presentation, dishes squeezed in a small plate.  Also the cherry looks very small and cheap, and not fresh.  Squid ink soup is good, lions's head soup is good with poor presentation.  Oysters are fresh.  Slow cooked lobster in rice is good.  Green sticky rice ball taste good, but almost no presentation at all.  On the price, is over priced for the food and services I got.  Waiters/waitress are all very nice, but sometimes I had to wait for a long time to be served .  I spent $270 for two ppl, which I think I can get same food in DaDong Beijing at around $130.  The pictures I attached are from both DaDong NY and DaDong Beijing (I visited on May 4).  You can tell from comparing these pictures that the N.Y. location has a long way to go to catch up the DaDong's standard in Beijing.",1,2,2,yanlong h.,"New York, NY",0,2,6

5.0,5/13/2018,"I want to thank the N.Y. Times for their unfairly critical review of Dadong because it means you can actually get a reservation at this wonderful, upscale Chinese food temple. The menu is an interesting mix of classic Chinese dishes, like dumplings and noodles, paired with fascinating creations with Western ingredients, like champagne glazed tomatoes and foie gras cherries. The Peking duck was unique -- all about the crispy skin. The pancakes were the thinnest I have ever seen. The skin was delicious. I agree with reviewers who say in is lean on meat.But the amazing thing is that there are so many other delicious things on the menu that you don't need the duck if you don't want it. Most dishes are reasonably priced for this type of very stylish and elegant restaurant. And, the service was superb. Our waiter Robert was a partner who made the meal extra special by timing each course perfectly, giving us some nice treats for my wife's birthday and being helpful in choosing the dishes. We were stuffed, and the meal,was very expensive, but it was a great adventure and we will certainly be going back.",1,0,0,A P.,"New York, NY",1,33,0

Now the question is do you get your bang for the buck here? Well, that's all relative to everyone's individual wants and what you are willing to pay. Now with that being said it's time to move on to my dining experience.Robert our server was Amazing, he gave us great recommendatons and flowed our courses out in a timely and meticulous manner, it's all in the details people and Robert excelled in that department, thanks Robert for a job well done and for being our photographer as well.We ordered the following that evening:* Cherry foie Gras - Visual beautiful and simplistic, creamy, delicious and smooth like butter.* Scallop cappuccino soup - Looks like a cup of cappuccino with a thick head of foam. The soup was heavily seasoned with pepper and you can taste it, a bit too overpowering for my taste.* Saffron baby cabbage - Cooked with chestnuts and not much to look at, but looks can be deceiving. The cabbage cooked in saffron made for a delicious dish* Song Shu fish with pine nuts -  Deboned and fried to perfection, crispy and the sauce was sweet and savory.* Short ribs - My least favorite dish, it was a little on the bland side and I felt like I was eating pieces of flank steak. I actually enjoyed the onions in this dish more than the beef* Baked Chilean sea bass - If you love sea bass, ginger and garlic this is the one! The fish was moist and delicious. I ate enough garlic cloves to smell for weeks!* Pan seared buns - They came 4 per order and these are actually pretty big in size. The filling was juicy as one bite into these buns the juices ran all over the plate, come on who doesn't like juicy buns?* Zhajiang noodles - The noodles and sauce came seperate so you get to control the amount of sauce to add. The dish was OK as I thought the sauce was just barely enough to cover the noodles.* Peking duck - Delicious crispy skin,flavorful and tender meat. Our server Robert told us to dip the skin with just the sugar as it would add another dimension of flavor, he was right as our eyes rolled upward towards the back of our heads as we mouthed the words in unison ""OMG!"" The duck truly shines and stands alone as the sole winner here. This is a superb place to impress family, friends and that special someone in your life, not only do you get to dine in an amazing setting, experience unparalled service, but enjoy a well prepared and delicous meal that you and your guests will be talking about for a long time.",31,16,30,Tsz-Cheong C.,"Bayside, Queens, NY",891,514,9701

The snacks blew our mind. We especially enjoyed the Beijing meat balls with mozzarella fillings (don't miss the dipping), the wings and the spiced potato chips. The price was very reasonable ($9-$15 range) and I can't complain about the taste. They deliver an authentic Chinese flavor with clever twists - what you would expect if you are actually spending money in a restaurant in China. I would want to come back and try the bbq lamb skewers!On the side note, I also visited DaDong for sit-down meals a couple times. Two things you need to know about here is that 1) it's improving by the week (so don't be scared by earlier reviews), and 2) the seasonal specials are really worth a try. Ever since the spring seasonal menu was launched, I would always order ""shepherd's purse wontons""（春菜馄饨） and ""spring onions and tofu""（小葱拌豆腐）. They are such household dish in China, with the fresh ingredients it brings me right back home. Lobsters on Saffron rice with balsamic vinegar pearls is also my go-to; the perfect blend-in between sticky rice and risotto, with literally half a lobster on top - texture/flavor/seafood heaven.Looking forward to the summer seasonal specials!",1,0,0,Nicole Z.,"Flatiron, Manhattan, NY",5,3,20

4.0,5/9/2018,"Finally decided to bite the bullet and give dadong a shot despite all the negative reviews on yelp. Our experience on a Sunday evening was quite surprisingly pleasant for the most part. The Host/Waiter service was spot on. Our waiter was polite and checked on us often to make sure we were doing well and kept refilling our pancakes etc. the only reason I was debating between a 3.5 and 4 is because of how awful and dry the Wagyu Fried rice was. It was basically inedible despite looking good when it was presented. It was also a bit odd considered the fried rice showed up literally a few minutes after we ordered. They definitely gotta get this sorted especially when you are charging $22 for a dish. Thankfully the rest of the meal was extremely satisfying! We got a whole Peking duck which was carved to order, the skin was crispy and the meat was moist (phew!) and the 3 ways to eat it (pancake, bun, skin +sugar) was a nice touch ! Overall a positive experience and it would be overly harsh of me to deduct a star for one bad dish. Few more tweaks to make and dadong you are almost there",0,0,0,Prasath S.,"Frisco, TX",91,274,1089
1.0,5/5/2018,"Updated:I decided to give Dadong another shot after a couple of months, hoping that everything would be improved. However my experience was even worse. I think the root cause is the inappropriate food serving from the waiters and not applicable dining wares. Again the table is way too small for Chinese food, which needs to be at least big enough to serve multiple dishes at the same time. Our waiter literally had to ask us to finish up whatever we had on the table in order to serve the duck. Also The table next to us was empty, why can't he just combine these two tables ?The waiters that take care of serving water and refilling drinks are very BIG PROBLEM!!!! They knocked my bag off the chair multiple times when they walked past me , didn't even pick it up! And they spilt water on my phone when refilling the glass, didn't even say anything !!!!! The worst was, they spilt wine on a guy sit on a nearby table! The wine was all over him, the chair, the table, the waiter just said sorry and cleaned up the floor very roughly and walked away!!!!

Apart from the food on the menu, DaDong also recently opened up their Patio Bar area as the weather warmed up.

4.0,4/7/2018,"We had a dinner for 8 last night to bid farewell to some good friends who are moving to California.  We all love peking duck and some of us have been to the original Dadong in Beijing, so we picked this location (over some hesitation given the bad NYT review and some of the reviews here). However, we found it to be a marvelous dining experience and worthy of your time.  The bar had a long list of special cocktails creatively designed around the Year of the Dog. We tried the ""Nice Work if You Can Get It""(Michter's Bourbon, Escubac, Bittermen's Amère Nouvelle, inspired by George Gershwin, An American in Paris, Old Fashioned Style) and the ""Kiss Me Baby & Tell Me Twice"" (Maestro Dobel Reposado Tequila, Lemon, Honey, Crème de Cacao, Peychaud's Bitters, inspired by Michael Jackson, Pretty Baby with the High Heels On, Dance-Floor Ready) and found them to be delectably complex. We opted for the five course tasting menu (which required the whole table) and settled in for the meal at a very nice table in a semi private pocket off the main floor of the restaurant.  Most of the clientele were Asian, which is always a good sign.  (half of our party was Asian)The menu started with Pickled Wild Kohlrabi Radish (spicy, cold and tart) and shepard's purse wontons in Huadiou Wine Broth (a little undercooked but OK and the broth was delicious.  Next we chose between Kobe Beef or Slow Cooked Canadian Lobster.  The beef was served in two dice sized blocks that barely merited a mouthful.  There was more substance to the lobster, with three large pieces of juicy lobster meat over a rissotto-like bed of saffron rice and the balsamic vinegar pearls provided a burst of spice.  So far the portions had been a little disappointing but the next course made up for it.  The duck was served in copious portions (although they refused to send us the bones when we asked for them) along with pancakes, crispy sesame buns, a special sauce (not hoisin) and little piles of sugar.  We also got some Korean spicy garlic paste.  The duck was 7 or 8 out of 10 on our scale.  Very thick crunchy skin, almost candied.  Lean duck with subtle flavors.  Plenty of leftovers to take home (that's how much was served).We polished the meal off with sachima matcha (sort of rice krispie treats) and some after dinner teas and digestifs (amaro).  We were pleasantly surprised after so many negative reviews.  The service was attentive and smart, including the somelier, and the room is very pretty.  I did wonder who was picking the music as it swung wildly from 80s New Wave to anonymous instrumentals.  It wasn't clear what DaDong was trying to be so there is something hazy and confused about the experience.  Are they aiming for multiple Michelin stars? They don't have the consistency and level of service to achieve that goal (yet).  Highlights included the cocktails and the duck, lowlights were the undercooked wontons and teeny tiny steak portions (which had to be served at medium rare, no exceptions, which was expected but still disappointing).  Expense was around $200 per person (including tip, wine and cocktails). Overall, this is a much better restaurant that the other reviews have suggested.  Definitely recommend.  If you're a real peking duck fan, we would still go to Ducked Up in Ludlow House or Decoy or Peking Duck House (in Chinatown) for better birds.",0,0,0,Adrian S.,"Manhattan, NY",0,5,0

2.0,4/1/2018,"I had wanted to visit since before their launch, with the idea that this would be an upscale Chinese restaurant in midtown Manhattan, similar to previously styled Hakkasan. Thus, even despite the low rating, I went in excited to give it a try (I went for lunch in the second floor dining area). I walked out disappointed and felt the Yelp 2.5 stars was a fair rating.First, the decor 3/5: the first floor hallway is beautifully designed - a spacious welcome with just a touch of Chinese aesthetics. The second floor dining area is also thoughtfully designed. The tableware leaves much to be desired: the plates appear off-white (though clean), which is not what I'd expect for a restaurant of this price range. The porcelain duck chopstick holder also seems cheap.Second, the service 2/5. Overall the staff was very professional and friendly. However we never had a person introduce himself as our server (I still don't know who our server was) and we actually flagged down a few different people to get service/ask questions. It just didn't feel organized - initially my menu came with just the cover (no menu pages inside), and our order was missing an item, which no one checked up on and which we had to point out after the entire meal was served.Third, the food 1.5/5. There's really nothing special about any of the dishes - really below average in terms of taste and creativity. Lion's head soup - though fragrant, this isn't any tastier than a typical home cooked or Chinatown lion's head dish (and by fine dining standards the appearance of the oil was unsightly). The abalone with farro: farro was served lukewarm and greasy, though the abalone itself was seasoned to expectations. The duck was the most egregious part of this experience. Named ""Su bu ni"", it translates roughly to ""crispy but not greasy"". I'll grant that it may be less greasy than the average Peking duck, but the fact it was served pretty much cold still accentuates the grease/fat. And aside from the duck leg, which I have to rate 4/5, the rest of the duck was not at all crispy. I believe, based on the speed with it came out of the kitchen, this dish was prepared ahead of time and kept warm, meaning there's no way for this to maintain crispiness. Side note: Peking duck in Peking is just served with skin and no meat, because crispiness is the most important quality.Overall this is a 2/5. I generally try to keep the objective rating and review separate from the price, but in this case I'll admit it had something to do with it, because in order for me to give this a 3/5 the $140 meal would've had to cost a quarter what it did. I would suggest to the owners that if they're aiming for fine dining, to take a look at what others are doing - the reason each dish at Per Se comes with small portions is because of the extra attention paid to said smaller portions, whereas at Da Dong, the smaller portion appear to be smaller for the sake of it. I would also suggest to look at other Chinese restaurants - the food must first and foremost be tasty and fresh (and warm out of the kitchen).",1,0,0,Rame N.,"New York, NY",5,34,48

4.0,3/27/2018,"We came to celebrate my mother's birthday, and she requested DaDong because she said all her friends went and they were raving about how good the food is...given it's dismal online ratings, I was going in preparing for the worst.  But I am glad that it turned out to be ONE OF THE BEST CHINESE FOOD RESTAURANTS I've eaten in the NJ/NY area!!!  Finally!  Someone is giving Chinese food class, respect and revere!Since we ordered a lot (it was a birthday celebration!), let's just itemized from the beginning.-Green tea pot, 5+ stars!  Forgot what was the special one my mother ordered, but it was the most amazing green tea I've ever had...refined, elegant and bold (yea, and I'm talking about green tea here, not wine lol), the tea was delicious and aromatic.  Not sure how else to describe it except you just need to try it!  -Calm in an ice ball, 5 stars (from their Spring menu)...the presentation was stunning, here, the waiter did a GREAT job and told us to ""break the ice ball with your spoon as it is believed to be good luck!""  The explanation made the whole experience SO much better!  The clam itself was just superb, firm with a bite but not chewy...it was perfectly cooked and seasoned...I only wish it came in a bigger ice bowl lol...but, like most fancy restaurants, it's about QUALITY and not QUANTITY.-Foie Gras Cherries, 4 stars.  Again, beautiful presentation...reminds me of the ""Meat Fruit"" in a particular London restaurant.  The Foie Gras was extremely creamy and smooth, almost too smooth for my taste.  However, my mom seemed to really enjoy it.-Cold pickled cucumber, 5 stars.  This is a classic ""down home"" type of cold appetizer in China.  Nothing fancy, just some basic sweet and sour and savory pickles but it is so refreshing when done properly.  The texture is not crunchy like you would expect from a pickle, but more softer/bendy...however, this is how it's done in the olden days in China (so I'm told) and my mother really appreciated that.  Taste wise, I loved it...perfect balance of sweet, sour & savory!-Tofu dish with scallion, 5+ stars.  Another classic ""down home"" dish, I ordered it because I was curious how could a fancy restaurant play up such a simple and homey dish.  Well, DaDong did a fantastic job and exceeded my expectations.  The tofu was artfully cut into small bite sized pieces and tasted creamy and almost BUTTERY!  The sauce was a perfect bite/balance to the creamy tofu.  I do have to warn you that this tofu is NOT SILKEN or even close to what we typically have in the grocery stores!  It is (probably made by DaDong) as it is a rougher/courser texture.  My sister, who is an ABC was like ""what's wrong with this tofu!""  My mother and I then explained to her that this is actually what it used to taste like when it was made by hand instead of machine.  -Saffron rice with lobster, 5 stars.  Ok, now I'm running out of space, it was great, lobster was tender, get it, you won't regret it.-Chilean sea bass, 5+ stars.  SUPER TENDER, FLAKY, CREAMY and JUICY!!!  Perfect light touches of sichuan pink peppercorns on top!-Dumplings 3 stars.  Good presentation, but nothing to write home about.-Peking duck, 5+ stars (the crown jewel here) with the caviar supplement.  WORTH IT!  The duck is small, but the meat is mighty!  The skin was perfectly crispy, not a lot of fat and so delicious.  Put some caviar right on the skin and you've got the perfect vessel to port the caviar into your mouth!!!  The duck meat was perfectly seasoned, had a slight hint of smoke but extremely rich.  Do not be fooled by the size, as it is filling and remember, QUALITY not quantity!-Crystal vegetable with bamboo shoots bun, N/A stars.  Never arrived, it must have gotten lost in the kitchen or didn't get entered into the ticket...oh well, the waiter was super apologetic and really nice about it so who cares...we were full anyways!!!The only reason I'm giving them 4 stars instead of 5 is because their service could be improved.  NOT FOR LACK OF TRYING, as every person there were extremely friendly, helpful and trying their best.But I also understand that DaDong is probably gunning for a Michelin star (based on their location, presentation, $$$ and etc), is given that, their service needs to be more refined.  Still water shouldn't be poured into our sparkling water glass, waiters need to explain the food they are presenting, orders shouldn't be forgotten (they forgot our crystal vegetable bamboo shoots bao things, but it's fine b/c we way over-ordered anyways lol), and just little things like that...just small graceful touches that separates the regular restaurants from a Michelin star or two.  But, it's a relatively new restaurant operating in a new territory (or country I guess in this case), so I'm willing to give them more time to work out the service kinks and will definitely be back again!!!Bottom line, this is NOT your average Chinese restaurant in the U.S.A...this is elevated Chinese Fusion dining.",4,0,2,Christina D.,"Jersey City, NJ",212,264,973
4.0,3/26/2018,"After reading reviews on Yelp and Google, I had set my expectations low before I went. To my surprise, the spring seasonal menu was way beyond my expectation. We started with rose cakes, the taste of which is refreshing. The next 2 dishes are onion tofu and wonton from the spring seasonal menu. The presentation of both reminded me of some old Chinese poems. Kinda being nostalgic but that was what I had in mind. Then the duck came. The duck wasn't too fatty which is great. I very much enjoyed the traditional wrapping with garlic and sugar sauce. The duck skin's crisp and the duck meat is tender. We also ordered the cherry foie gras. This dish is my favorite. The color and the look were adorable. And the texture of the foie gras was smooth. The waiter for our table was very attentive and knowledgable. He gave us great suggestions on the portion and size of the dishes. I think DaDong is improving for sure.

4.0,3/26/2018,"As I experience, I feel the 2.5 starts rating was unfairly low... If with a hope to rise up the overall rating, I was even about to give a 5 stars. After a second thought, I chose to stick with my ongoing rating standard and tried to be most objective in every rating I gave.Honestly I have nothing to complain about the food, because every course I ordered was yummy yet creative in some way. From sea cucumber to fried rice, I am very satisfied. Except one thing - the thin pancakes, scallions, cucumbers that come with the Beijing roast duck are in tiny portions. We have 6 people and expect they would autonomously adjust sides amount for us, but they didn't. Waiters seemed not even notice we lack the pancakes. We have to ask twice to get extra. And viewing this from another angle, the service was not even close to Da Dong's pricing level.With that being said, I can understand why people feel frustrated about this place. The pricing is not set right. I think it should be either higher or lower. If higher, Da Dong should offer better service (more attentive so customers don't need to ask for everything...), more decent-size food (at least feed people enough food; $98 can only buy you a single-serve cucumber is intimidating). If lower the price, Da Dong can expand their menu to more course options. As large group coming here, we barely find enough courses that attract us.

We ordered the seared beef which might have been good, but I didn't get to try it. On a splendidly large platter were two tiny cubes of beef with an artful streak of sauce....for $40. This should be considered an appetizer/snack rather than an entree. The kung pao chicken, while relatively larger portioned, had more chilies and peanuts than chicken. I think I was able to find two pieces of chicken when digging in for my share. The Peking duck was fine, nothing outstanding that would justify the $100.

2.0,3/17/2018,"After much hype and high expectations of DaDong's NYC debut, my group was disappointed, and I would not come back on my own initiative. DaDong NYC does not come close to its DaDong Beijing version, which charges RMB 198 (USD 32) for a whole duck vs. DaDong NYC charging USD 100 + additional $5 per extra condiment (cucumber, pancake). BTW, charging extra for the cucumbers, scallions, pancake is not the norm and no other duck specialty restaurant I have been to in USA, HK, China does that. It's like ordering a $30-40 gourmet burger and they charge you extra $5 for lettuce, tomato slices when the portion amount was inadequate in the first place. Food: Very costly and small proportions. Sure, you can say that other restaurants such as high-end Japanese restaurants charge a lot for small proportions, but Dadong NYC is deviating from the usual high-end Chinese restaurant practice, and you can't help but feel taken advantage of at the end of the day. Our group ordered 2 whole ducks (lean, not as juicy as the ones in China), Lotus Root with Glutinous Rice (this was ok, could use more rice), Truffle Braised Whole Abalone (delicious), Wagyu Beef Fried Rice (delicious), Beijing ZhaJiang Noodles (too salty). The cocktail drinks were very good. Atmosphere in the Main dining room: Nice interior decor. The tables were too small and we barely had any room. Everyone's elbows were 1-2 inches from each other.

5.0,3/16/2018,"I was hesitant about making a celebration dinner reservation at Dadong because of the mixed reviews, both on Yelp and Google. But I am very glad I did go and everyone in the party was very happy with our dinner. The restaurant itself was a little bit hard to find at first. But walking a little bit west on the 42nd and you will see it on your left side. Staff at the entrance and the coat check-in area were very welcoming, and we got seated immediately upon arrival at 5:15 on a Friday. For six of us, one whole roast duck, song shu fish, Dadong eggplant, pepper wagyu beef, baby cabbage, pan-fried buns and a few drinks were adequate. I've had Peking duck at several Chinese restaurants, and this is definitely authentic and one of the best ones. Two plates of meat from one duck were still small portions, but I quite liked the lean meat. It is not dry, and not greasy either. Just a perfect combination of crispy skin and tender duck meat! The garlic paste that came with it was a nice surprise too. The song shu fish could have fried a tad lighter and used more sauce. But the presentation of the fish amazed my party. Service was great too. Our waiter was friendly and had confident smiles. Other staff filled water and changed our plates promptly. One small suggestion I have for the restaurant is to familiarize the staff with the details of menu items. One of the staff we asked knew that the dish was called song shu fish, but didn't know what type of fish it is. Overall, I really enjoyed dinner at Dadong. Yes, similar dishes for cheaper price and bigger portion could probably be found at many Chinese restaurants in the city, but food presented as an art was rare.

I was very against going to saltbae's spot so i voted for Dadong.... smdh. The food we had here tonight was not worth the money spent. A few dishes stuck out but not for good reasons. The biggest disappointment was the spicy lobster dish (i didnt do the ordering so im not sure of the exact names of the dishes). This particular lobster dish came out in this big serving plate and it looked beautiful. But this was all a mirage. 90% of the plate was just chili peppers and peppercorns. There was barely any meat. The wagyu fried rice was ok. I wish there was less soy sauce mixed in it though. We also had the sliced beef with leeks. Similar to the spicy lobster dish we had, it was 10% meat and 90% filler. It didnt taste any different than how other restaurants would serve it in surrounding areas. Now onto their staple dish, the peking duck. I will say that the carving and the presentation of the duck was very nice. As far as taste, it was mediocre. The wait staff offered recommendations on how to eat the duck. The duck came with the usual pancakes and some hollow crispy sesame bun. The waiter recommended we use some garlic paste with the sesame bun and duck. I gave it a try but the garlic paste was just overwhelming. The other dishes we had are not even worth mentioning because come to think of it, everything was pretty badI walked away less than pleased. I was hungry again in an hr and we ordered quite a bit. I dont mind paying good money for good food but i do mind spending good money on at best, average food. To sum this review up, Dadong is straight basura.

I bit into a plum pit- when I pointed it out to the server she said it was part of the dish.....The braised cabbage was nothing to write home about and the fried rice same (but too oily)- they were the best thing we had :-/I ordered a cocktail, it had ice chips floating all around in it- super disappointing and somewhat of a sin.The Peking duck wasn't the worst.... the mushu pankakes were perfectly fine, but their ""recommended process "" was kind of BS... sorry... and the sesame ""buns"" were a total throwaway.Unless you are forced to come- don't!Servers have obviously been taught to overcompensate for the restaurant's poor rating.

However, for the couple of experiences I had at the New York location, I had a good time for every visit. Although Peking Duck is the signature here, Dadong is actually famous for not just the duck. The abalone dishes are superb and I really liked the sea urchin rice. Also Chef Dong Zhenxiang reinvented many classic Chinese dishes, such as Song Shu Fish, Kung Pao Shrimp and Braised Eggplant. All of them are worth trying. Another signature of Dadong is their sea cucumber.

I think Chinatown Peking duck is better than this. DaDong NY needs some change. Need to bring the real quality (China level) to here. Can't be bogus Chinese food and charge a premium price. I gave 2 stars just because of the decoration. This week is unlucky. Had just for fen yesterday. No flavor but relatively cheap. Today's DaDong is just disappointing and expensive.

We ordered a number of dishes, including the signature duck, but now, just a few weeks after visiting, I can barely remember a single one - that's how unmemorable they are. Nothing stood out in terms of flavor. The portions were so small that our table of 4 each got essentially a single small bite of each dish.

I haven't had Peking duck in years, since the last time I was in China (over 10 years ago).Ok the cons: service was pretty awful, ngl. It felt like we were being rushed out of the restaurant. I understand it's a busy place and it's overwhelming but for such a high price point I did NOT come to feel like I was being ushered out. Also, I'm always wary of really highly priced Chinese food. Is this kung pao chicken really going to be so ostensibly gourmet that it costs 2-3x what you can get in Chinatown? Reasonable minds will differ. Anyways, pros: the duck! I don't care who rips the duck, it is probably close to the best Peking duck you can get in America. A lot of ppl complain about the skin being too fatty or there not being enough meat and only skin. To them I say: you don't know Peking duck lol. This is one of the leaner duck places, and the skin was great and crunchy, just as it's supposed to be. Other than duck, we also got: geoduck & foie gras (both appetizers). Neither was special but I'm just not a fan of foie gras in general. We also got: zha jiang mian, and black pepper beef with dried chili (a5 kobe). Basically, everything other than the duck was just ""eh"" (again, you can get better taste for waaaay lower price point almost anywhere in Chinatown), but the kobe killed it. Definitely a great spin on kobe. Kinda hesitated ordering at first but so worth! A different taste and a very high quality beef. Over all, the hype for the duck is worth it.

The DaDong Kung Pao Shrimp with peanuts followed by cold avocado noodles with spicy Sichuan Sauce dish was just supreme. It's probably the best Kung Pao dish I ever had in NYC. Next was our dessert plates... we ordered three different kinds (sorry forget which) and they all tasted very rich with subtle smell of citrus and cheese.   Overall a good night and nice experience at Dadong, though I would want to know if their menu will change for the Spring.",2,0,0,子力,"San Gabriel, CA",11,3,1

We waited for 20 mins, didn't get seated, went to ask the waitress if table is ready. Then table was ready immediately. If you made your guests wait for 20 mins, you don't need reservation system. And the fact that the table was ready immediate when we asked made the whole experience ironic. I went to DaDong a lot in Beijing, I don't need to come here to have bad Saturday night.

5.0,3/3/2018,"We were very pleasantly surprised by DaDong. We've been going to the Beijing locations for the past 7 years so we were excited having DaDong open in NYC. So here's our point if view:- the food: we had the Cherry Foie Gras, Beijing Zhajiang Noodles and a whole roast duck. All delicious and more than enough for the 3 of us (including our toddler). The duck was by far the best we've had in NYC, a very decent amount of food, lean and flavorful like what we can find in Beijing. However if your standard is the fatty duck that is usually found on this side of the planet maybe youkll be disappointed.- the service: great, attentionate, welcoming and efficient.

2.0,3/1/2018,"I initially made a reservation for the tasting menu, but then canceled it after reading the bad reviews. I also had a reservation for the dining room and was intending to cancel it, but my friends were still curious to try it. I was curious too, so I kept it. Overall, I think 2.5 stars is pretty accurate. I set my expectations low, and it was exactly what I expected. I was already prepared for the expensive price and small portions, so that wasn't a problem for me. The food was just plain not good. We ordered the $98 whole portion of duck. It came as two small...emphasis on the small...plates of duck with two legs, but it was mostly skin and barely any meat. The skin is my favorite part, but not when there's only small dry pieces of meat to go with it. The tiny plate of scallion, cucumber, and cantaloupe was laughable. At least they gave lots of tianmianjiang. The second basket of pancakes was free, which I was pleasantly surprised by that. The sesame pancakes were interesting. I'm not sure it goes well with the duck, but they were fun to eat. The garlic paste that came with it is strong. It also doesn't go well with the duck. They have carvers stationed randomly around the restaurant just carving at all times. It's actually kind of strange. In addition to the duck, we also ordered the Cherry Foie Gras, Wagyu Fried Rice, Zha Jiang Mian, and Chilean Sea Bass.I enjoyed the Cherry Foie Gras. It came as 4 foie gras cherries and 4 real cherries. It's pretty much just foie gras pate, but it was a delicious bite. Don't get the Wagyu Fried Rice. It's a waste of money. The wagyu actually detracted from the fried rice. It tasted like tiny crumbly pieces of dried beef and made for an unpleasant texture. The rice itself was bland and oily.There were lots of pieces of pork belly fat in the Zha Jiang Mian. I liked the edamae and celery in it, but the portion were tiny for $16. The anise flavor was very strong in the sauce. I like Taiwanese zha jiang mian so much better.I expected the Chilean Sea Bass to be small for $48 and it was. The fish itself was delicious. Flaky, fatty, and moist. But I think I attribute that more towards the inherent nature of sea bass than their preparation of it. The waiter made a point that there were 32 cloves of garlic under the fish, but I don't see why that makes the dish any special. I enjoy cloves of garlic when they are roasted until soft or braised in soy sauce. But these pieces of garlic were barely cooked and had no flavor except the oil. Definitely not a defining feature of the dish by any means. Overall, the food was mediocre and the service was respectable. It turned out to be $75ish per person and I did leave full. This is definitely Asian fusion. There was really nothing Chinese about it at all, and I went in expecting that. Despite the beautiful interior, the food is not delicious. If you want a similar experience but much better food, try Decoy. Their tasting menu is around $75 per person and the caliber of food is much higher.",32,9,11,Jocelyn K.,"Jersey City, NJ",479,885,4955
4.0,2/26/2018,"Came here for a company dinner to celebrate the year of the Dog. The restaurant is located in Bryant Park which is conveniently one stop away from us. For a beautiful Monday night, it wasn't packed. Once there, we were directed to the second floor of the restaurant. We were promptly seated at the window overlooking their terrace seating (which was closed at this time) by the bar. The ambiance is dim lit with a huge light fixture above the bar which is centrally positioned in the dining area. I assume you can come casually dressed, but most were in business attire because people were coming after work. There were 6 of us tonight and here's what we ordered:- 1 DaDong ""Su Bu Ni"" Roasted whole duck - 1 DaDong ""Su Bu Ni"" Roasted half duck** ducks served w/ sugar, garlic paste, pancakes, crispy sesame buns, ""special sauce"" (which I think is Hoisin sauce) and strips of vegetables **Tip: half duck serves one person- 1 Wagyu Seared beef w/ preserved Sichuan Vegetables- 2 pan-seared pork and shrimp steam buns- 2 cold avocado noodles with spicy Sichuan Sauce- 1 Wagyu Beef and rice - 1 DaDong Kung Pao Shrimp with peanuts, chillies & scallions- 1 DaDong braised eggplantWe all had drinks (sorry, this part is vague - I don't remember what everyone had):- 2 beers- 2 cocktails: (1)""Famous Wardrobes"" - Palo Santo-Infused Hudson Rye, Forthave Marseille Amaro, Dry Vermouth, Sweet Vermouth, (don't remember the 2nd)- 2 wines: I got the Pinot Grigio, don't remember the other...Not quite sure about the terrible reviews prior to mine...but one must understand how the food was made/prepared and how expensive some of the ingredients can be.  Duck is always expensive -- even in Chinatown...saffron, also expensive, that's why it is such a small portion. If you go to a fine dining restaurant, that is what you have to consider. One of the dishes mentioned to us had an ingredient that included a 30 year old wine cooked into the dish. How about the 10 gram caviar pairing with the roast duck? Regardless of poor reviews, we had a great experience tonight and the food was spectacular. The staff was attentive and friendly. The service was fast, and our wait time for the food wasn't long. Our server was very knowledgeable and answered all our questions.  I forgot her name, but she definitely helped us as far as ordering accordingly. We wanted to make sure we had enough portions for the group, and she guided us the whole way through. The highlight of my night was being able to take pictures with the Chef! :)I do recommend trying this place out mainly for special occasions. This is the best authentic Chinese food I've had in a while.The reason for my 4 stars: we were trying to get an RSVP for 6:30pm.  They had contacted us and said that there was no availability for that time and told us 5pm.  They called back a day later saying that there was a 5:45pm opening.  We ended up taking that.  We left at 7:30pm and there were plenty of tables open.  Half of the dining floor was empty.

2.0,2/21/2018,"Overall, I think Da Dong is an overpriced, disappointing restaurant. I would not mind paying exorbitant prices for really amazing, mind-blowing Chinese food, but unfortunately, the food at Da Dong is good at best, and if you're not willing to shell out a lot of money, you certainly will not leave feeling full.My family and I came here on Chinese New Year Eve for dinner. After deliberating for quite a bit, we ordered a whole roast duck, the slow-cooked lobster in saffron rice, the shon shu fried fish, snow pea sprouts, and the pan-seared pork and shrimp steamed buns. We also ordered four drinks among all of us.What I liked: the roast duck, which is Da Dong's signature dish, was presented uniquely with a variety of condiments to wrap with the duck (for example, sugar crystals and melon for a sweet duck sandwich in a sesame bun, or garlic paste and hoisin sauce for a garlicky twist on the classic Beijing roast duck wrap). This was pretty different and not something I would've thought of doing at home. The shon shu fried fish and the pork buns were good too, though not mind-blowing. Just good.What I disliked: I think it's crazy the amount of actual duck meat you're served given the fact that each whole duck costs $100. You end up with two small plates of duck meat after the chef is done carving. Additionally, the snow pea sprouts dish was TINY. It was about ¾ of a cup of basic, stir-fried snow peas. We just ordered it because we didn't have any veggies, but each of the five of us ate probably a spoonful of it. Finally, the lobster with rice was essentially an Italian risotto. It was good...but not Chinese food and not at all what I was expecting.After we finished eating our main dishes, we ordered a tiny tangerine peel flavored ice cream to end the dinner on a sweet note and wash away the flavor of the fried fish. Despite this interesting ice cream, I could not help but feel incredibly unsatisfied when I went home, especially after my brother and I paid our $400 bill.",7,1,0,Julie C.,"Manhattan, NY",372,35,216

4.0,2/20/2018,"Beautiful lobby and beautiful restaurant.  The no-stars review from Eater or whatever was a joke, just part of the push against fine dining.  I wouldn't say it was absolutely perfect, which of course it should be since that's what it's trying to be.  I would say 4.5 stars but Yelp doesn't offer a half star, and i only say 4.5 instead of 5 because it's fine dining and very small mistakes were made.I waited for my date at the bar and the bartender Peter (?) was charming.    Recommended a glass of champagne and it was wonderful.  Every member of the waitstaff was so welcoming actually, the host and hostesses were lovely and I could see from the interactions I watched as I waited for my friend that the employees really enjoy each other & working at DaDong.  The sommelier or wine steward that helped me choose a bottle of wine was very welcoming and great at his job: my friend specifically wanted a Chard, and was afraid of a Riesling or a Gewurtz, we talked it out and wound up with a great bottle.  Most of the press about DaDong mentions its wine program being aggressive about offering a hundred or whatever bottle around $60; it's true, I would say most of the most was $60 and $70 bottles, I think our was $64? Reasonable, good value, I appreciated this.  Our server was sweet and happy to be there.   She instantly brought us more pancakes when we killed the first stack.Smallest nitpicks, that I probably wouldn't take into account if it was a more casual place: We ordered snow peas that never arrived, and I don't know if they were on the bill or not because we only remembered when we got outside.  A few reviews had mentioned that they experienced that sort of embarrassing, tacky direct-you-to-the-most-expensive-items ""help"" from waitstaff and wine steward; one guy had said he was directed to a four-figure magnum for wine? Haha. Our server sort of did that with the menu, really pushing the sea cucumber, whatever their lobster dish is and the live crab, and pushing two-person portions whenever there was a choice.  Sea cucumber is a delicacy and it's nice to see it on the menu and I will prob (definitely ha ha) come back to try it, but it's a $200 item so people know if they're coming for it that night or not.  I had asked about an uni item they called ""sea urchin rice,"" and the server could really only say ""it has nice flavor"".  if she had connected my inquiry to the sea cucumber dish--something like ""Since you enjoy uni, did you see that we offer a sea cucumber dish?-- I could understand, that's a logical connection to make.  Oh man, now I'm thinking about uni and sea cucumber.  :-)  Only other (tiny) snag was that I had to ask about the glass of champagne I left at the bar when my date arrived and we moved to the table, in this kind of restaurant the move to a table should be seamless.We ordered the duck, the sole, and the wagyu fried rice. We had a two-person portion of the duck, and it was SO much!  It would be phenomenal to come back and chow down on such a large portion another time.  It was good enough I would have brought home leftovers if I wasn't on a date, and I never, ever take home leftovers.  It has to be REALLY worth it.  Funny enough, Mr Chow's is the only other restaurant I can think of that Ive brought home leftovers in the past couple years, and I mean that's part of your ordering strategy at Mr Chow's: it's Chinese, so there's going to leftovers you can easily reheat and still enjoy.  I really do disavow leftovers & I would've taken my duck home from Dadong had I been in different company.  Got to try to trick him that I'm an elegant lady of culture & dignity.   The wagyu fried rice was an enormous portion, too.  Deep flavor, lots of peas and sort of crispy, but still sort of creamy? Excellent, fun. The sole was a standout! We got a half portion or a 1-person portion and we ate it all between us.  It was served with cloves of garlic that melted in your mouth and big, fat, juicy blueberries.   It was a solid choice to have before the duck. The duck pancakes!  Wonderful.  I don't know why everybody's picking on the exact way they do their duck and their pancakes; if I want really crispy skin, if I'm craving crispy, tactile, crunchy skin and a crunchy carb to go with it I'd go find fried chicken and waffles (Southern Hospitality, 45th and 9th, consistently best in city).  The duck was moist and duck-y and yes the skin was only a little crispy, not crunch-under-your-teeth crispy; but when did we start wanting that?  Seriously, I don't know why so many reviewers feel the need to harp on this.  I think the textures, together in the water-thin batter pancakes, worked well.  The hoisin sauce was out of this world; I'm dreaming about it here the morning after.  Perfume-y and sweet but with a deep, distinctive flavor.  Maybe 4.75 stars.  Lots of people will probably find themselves debating to hit Mr Chow's or DaDong when the mood strikes.  I loved my experience and feel lucky I went!",0,0,0,Meghan S.,"Jersey City, NJ",87,7,0

1.0,2/12/2018,"I really wanted to enjoy my experience here, but it did not live up to my expectations at all. Having dined at the Beijing Wangfujing location, I had high hopes for the New York location. I met up with three others here for lunch to celebrate the lunar new year, which isn't to say that we expected an exceptional meal but rather that we were in good spirits and optimistic only to be let down. The positives: the decor is nice (although not nearly as luxe as is the Beijing location) and the staff are nice and attentive. Their cocktails are fine, and the food presentation is average for the price point. The negatives: everything else, including the food. None of us came to DaDong expecting a cheap meal, but we left feeling disappointed because the portions were so minuscule. High end restaurants in NYC are infamous for charging an arm and a leg for their minimalist plates, but I really thought DaDong would be better. For example, we couldn't order the ""crystal"" vegetable buns because they came three to an order, which is so little and we were a party of four. Maybe the dinner menu is more expansive, but the lunch menu was just two pages, one of which was dedicated to prix fixe offerings; this means that their true range of dishes is very limited. We each had a cocktail that came with a raspberry, liquid nitrogen for effect, Pimms, and something else. It was tasty, but there was too much ice (obviously to inflate its volume).We ordered the sweet/sour ribs, the pea sprouts, the braised eggplant, the wagyu fried rice, and-of course-a whole duck. The ribs (see picture) were properly seasoned (if not a tad too sweet), and the presentation is pretty, but the portions are a couple of pieces too small. At first arrival, I actually thought that the presentation was a bit like a 3D render of traditional Chinese paintings, as the meat pile and plate itself evoke a landscape capped by fresh snowfall. Their vegetable selection is painfully limited, which is inexcusable given the meat-heaviness of the full menu. The vegetable selection basically amounted to eggplant and (off the menu) pea sprouts, so we ordered both. The flavor was fine for both, but again the portions were just too small, even if we were only a dining party of two. The wagyu rice had such tiny pieces of wagyu that it was almost insulting to be marketed as wagyu rice...and it didn't taste much different than the average takeout fried rice. Maybe this would be ok for those unfamiliar with Chinese food and non-Chinese people.The duck was the entire reason for the visit. In Beijing, DaDong's duck is famed for its deliciousness, meticulous preparation, and presentation. After having a mediocre meal at Peking Duck House the week before, I came to DaDong for it to be done properly. Unfortunately, our $98 duck failed on all accounts. The skin wasn't crisp, as it should be-it was as if they had just picked an average duck from a rotisserie. The duck wasn't sliced tableside; it came separated on two plates, with a third bearing the two leg pieces (the only crispy pieces that we were served). I don't care that it's lunchtime--especially because my duck at DaDong Beijing was sliced tableside during lunch service. We were also informed that the duck would not be prepared three ways (skin for the traditional Peking preparation, meat incorporated into a separate and usually stir fry dish, and bones utilized for a hearty soup--which Peking Duck House does do, albeit mediocrely) because the restaurant wasn't yet prepared to do so, which is absolutely ridiculous because this restaurant has been in the works for years and I don't believe that it wasn't considered--instead I think it speaks more to the choices undertaken at this location. I also understand that this location goes to great lengths to source its ducks, which at least showed in the duck tasting fine. The accompaniments (the puffed bing, regular bing, cucumbers, etc.) were fine. I was so excited to show my friends a good restaurant from China. None of us will be coming back.",3,0,0,Sam H.,"Manhattan, NY",0,48,27
5.0,2/12/2018,"Came here for lunch. Great food, great service, awesome monkey kings, and nice ambience. A bit on the expensive side but occasionally worth it. Unlike the other reviews complaining of bad food and mediocre service, my experience was quite nice. The sea bass is tasteful but wayyy to much garlic - a bit wasteful for a Chinese restaurant Peking duck was great but pancakes were dry - had to send them back, but staff happily sent over new ones,The eggplant was good too, wish I had more of it than an off-centered partial plate worthFavorite part was the Monkey King cocktail.

1.0,2/10/2018,"If I could I would give a 0 STAR. Food is soooo overpriced and bad. They use trashy wines to replace good label wines and priced it as authentic. Ive live in China for 25years and I can assure you the quality of the food is not even 1/10 as good as a places in an average restaurant in China. If compare to restaurants in New York, it is even worse. Regardless it is Chinese food, the way they prepare food for cooking is not professional. Wagyu beef in fried rice occasionally has stinky taste, suggesting that they didn't store the meat right and the meat went bad before cooking. They probably did it intentionally because they thought people won't figure it out with heavy flavored fried rice. Cherry foie gras is a joke. It is only good by looking. It is stinky and didn't marinated with the right spices before cooking. Also, the liver they used was obvious not fresh. Maybe a week old, or maybe it is the storage issue again. The red coating on foie gras enhanced the bad stinky taste, left awful taste in your month.  I don't want to go in details with the main dishes because I'm worried that it will make me a hater. Duck is not bad, but doesn't worth the time and money. Duck cutter is not professional. Waiters and waitresses are nice. You can see that they are trying the best, but can't help much because the food and drink is too bad. I don't like the owners philosophy of treating  the clients. You can see that it becomes a pattern here that the owner tries to use cheap stuffs to trick customers.",7,4,2,Aissi W.,"London, Canada",2,6,18
3.0,2/10/2018,"This was my first Peking duck experience- came here with my colleagues for a work lunch. We shared 2 ducks for 8 people with some other dishes added as well. The food overall was pretty good, however, the quality did not match the price of the food. If all of these dishes cost 30-40% less, I would have given 4 stars. Starting with the duck- I think it was prepared quite nicely. The legs were definitely overdone but the skin was perfectly crisp and the breast had good flavor. The sides that they provided were not enough for the amount of duck on the table which was frustrating to keep requesting. Also, this was not the traditional Peking duck experience. Taste for duck: 4/5We also ordered the wagyu fried rice, sea bass, eggplant, sweet and sour cucumbers, and kung pao shrimp. The fried rice was delicious but the amount of beef in the dish was pathetic. They should not have even put the beef in the name because it was just barely sprinkled with beef. The sea bass was decent but could have had more flavor. The garlic bed was a waste- there was easily 100 garlic cloves that was wayyy too much to be consumed and thus just tossed (coming from a huge garlic lover). The shrimp dish was much too small for the price and the cucumbers were yummy.Probably would try elsewhere for Peking duck knowing the cost.",0,0,2,Dina K.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",359,88,203

And we thought the whole duck was a good amount of food. The vegetable buns were pretty tasty too (filling was very flavorful). The rest of our order was pretty mediocre though. Lotus root with sticky rice was not what we anticipated (sticky rice is stuffed in holes of the root and then it's served with a glutinous thick sweet sauce), but worth a try. The wagyu fried rice was uninteresting, and kind of dry to be honest, and the sea bass was half garlic gloves.

4.0,2/8/2018,"It's nowhere near as bad as described, it's really pretty good!So I've been to about 5-6 different DaDongs in Beijing so I think my opinion should be pretty qualified.1. The Peking duckDefinitely better than the other Peking ducks in NYC. The duck is so much leaner than at other shops, almost as lean as they should be in Beijing. These ducks had to be specially raised for the restaurant. Very well cooked and the chef carving the duck definitely knew what he was doing. The flavor was very refined and tasty. Skin was perfectly crispy. The pancake wraps were a little too starchy and dry but good enough. They don't let you take the rack, which is unusual for da dong.2. The rest of the menuMuch smaller than the Beijing menu, but everything I had was good. Had a vegetarian eat with us and all of the lotus and cabbage dishes were really good. Not on par with what I've had at other dadongs but they pay attention to detail and the presentation was impressive. Some of the Beijing iconic dishes were just ok: smoked salmon and avocado, duck treasure. Standouts were: lotus + sticky rice, cherry foie gras, saffron baby cabbage.3. DecorVery business lunch looking. I was only on the second floor so I can't speak to the 3rd. But the outdoor patio looked nice! Classy use of pagoda style pillars.4. ServiceDefinitely stepped their game up. Service is better here than in Beijing. They try so hard. Vying for that Michelin Star for sure.",1,0,2,Shannon Z.,"Elmhurst, NY",290,22,0
2.0,2/7/2018,"The extremely high price tag does not match with the flavors and creativity of the tasting menu. The 7-course tasting menu is $172/person, a steep price tag for the quality we received. Service is excellent, and the atmosphere of the restaurant, but it does not make up for the experience of the food.Cherry Glazed Foie Gras: While I generally enjoy foie gras, the cherry flavor did not agree with the saltiness of the foie gras. Additionally, it had a weird texture that was slick but sticky at the same time. Nice presentation, but I was not a fan.Sea Urchin on Rice: This dish was quite tasty - uni was fresh and the ginger and wasabi added  Beautiful, tight presentation as well, although I am not a fan of the pearls. Overall, these pearls will become slightly annoying later on.Hot and Sour Scallop Cappuccino: This is quite a unique dish, and it was one of the better dishes. The scallops were perfectly cooked, with delicious delicate flavor. There was a delightful pepper flavor throughout the broth that I enjoyed. On the top was an interesting foam that did not do much for me, but added to the cappuccino effect I guess.Slow-Cooked Lobster with Saffron Rice: One of the best dishes in this tasting menu - perfectly cooked lobster on top of delicious, creamy rice. The only annoying thing about this dish was the balsamic vinegar pearls on top of the rice, clumped together in awkward amounts.Palette Cleanser: A strawberry with cinnamon was a nice palette cleanser in between dishes.The next course was a choice between Kobe Beef and Sea Bass Fillet - Kobe Beef: I had never tried certified kobe beef, and unfortunately they slightly overcooked the beef. The flavor of the beef was excellent quality, as it was Kobe, but I could not truly enjoy kobe beef because of the cook on it (super disappointed!). Sea Bass Fillet: This sea bass was my favorite dish in the course. It was served on a bed of garlic that beautifully permeated the fish and was delicious on its own as well. The peppercorns on top gave the same hint of heat as they did in the cappuccino, which I loved. The best dish, although I'm not sure that it is worth the price tag either.The Peking Duck: Arguably the most important part of the meal, the duck itself was excellent. Amazing demo, plenty of duck to share between 3 people, high quality duck meat. Accompanying the duck was both traditional and contemporary interpretations; one was a garlic sesame bun, which was awkward to eat because it was hollow. According to the waiter, we were to eat it with a garlic sauce, the radish and cucumber. However, there are only enough buns served with the duck for everyone to eat one. Traditionally, there is the traditional wrap, which was unfortunately served slightly cold and hard. Multi-flavored White Chocolate Shells: Easily my second favorite dish throughout the meal - creative, beautiful, and interesting. The waiter informed us that the white chocolate shells contained several different flavors such as different citrus peels, sea salt, peppercorns, and more. It was fluffy and a nice way to end the meal.",1,2,0,Amy H.,"Houston, TX",6,38,74

Ordered a bowl of white rice and it was overnighted, dried and prob reheated from microwave. This place is expensive and food is plain bad. Do not bother.

2.0,2/4/2018,"4/10 I loved the DaDong in Beijing and my wife and I made a reservation months ahead when we heard DaDong was opening in NYC. After reading all the negative reviews I came in with very low expectations, but was still hoping that DaDong would stand out. Though we enjoyed ourselves, the price tag is simply too high for what DaDong delivers. The restaurant itself is beautiful, with a large, elegant bar. Many of the tables are high tops, which makes it a bit less comfortable than I would have liked. The bar was completely empty so it would be easy to grab a few seats if you didn't have a reservation. The service was extremely attentive, at times overly so; at one point the waiter brought us knife and fork and wouldn't take no for an answer when we said we were fine with chopsticks. The food is served beautifully and in small portions, as expected. We ordered the half duck, kung pao chicken, sweet and sour pork ribs, and beef fried rice. I liked the half duck and thought it was tasty but the portion was definitely not half of a duck (in China they literally give you everything, including the head and innards in a soup). I suspect they take part of each table's duck and use in other dishes. We liked the pork ribs, though they were very sweet. The kung pao chicken was sweet as well and was just okay - the sauce was a thin glaze rather than the thicker sauce you would receive in China. The rice was the most filling part of the meal and was somewhat unique, filled with many piece of chopped asparagus. For these 4 items and 2 cocktails the bill came to around $200. For the hefty price tag I wanted to be ""wow""ed or at least achieve the same experience I had in Beijing. I was hoping I would at least enjoy the kung pao chicken (one of my favorite dishes) and could drop in for this at the bar, but I didn't find it to be particularly special. Unless something changes I wouldn't return - the restaurant either needs to dramatically drop their prices or really step it up a notch to compete with other high priced restaurants.",9,3,0,Benjamin L.,"New York, NY",120,66,299
3.0,2/4/2018,"Though decoration and service are good, I feel the food itself is on average. We tried 10 dishes. Not like traditional Chinese food, they are beautifully decorated and arranged. However, I do not taste the delicious from the food itself. The meat does not seem to come from Wholefood at least. With high price tag, I thought the meat quality should be at least better than those from Wholefood. The temperature of the food is not well controlled. The duck is cold and dry and seems to be cooked one or two days ago instead of just out of oven. Personally I sure like duck just out of oven, crispy, warm and with a little fat but not cold fat. The cucumber supposedly should be more crispy and should have more flavor. Maybe I think too highly of this restaurant. In general, I gave two chances to a restaurant and hope i can have better food next time.",0,0,0,Sean L.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",0,4,3
2.0,2/3/2018,"I came to the NY location very excited because I have been to the Beijing location(s) every time I visit. If they had kept true to the Beijing experience and charged 3X to manage NY rent prices, this place would be a 5 star rating. But, it is a completely different experience. In Beijing, you get a chef table side who breaks the duck down in front of you. You have plenty of garnishes. You get duck soup made from the bones of your duck and a beautiful fruit presentation for dessert. In NYC, you get servers who are clearly not confident with service but very open to try to upsell you. Half of a duck for two people should be more than enough. Instead, we had half a duck and a spicy cucumber appetizer (with no hint of spice/heat). If the duck was the same quality, we would have added the other half duck. But, it wasn't. The duck was a 7/10. But if you know DaDong (Beijing) it is the best Peking duck experience in the world. It elevates the whole experience to a new level. NY, is an opportunist's attempt to overcharge, underserve, and will most likely fail because it isn't worth going back. The food is made to be beautiful.

I came here for dinner with 3 other friends and we ordered up a feast. The meal started with Steamed Snow Crab over eggs in Shaoxing wine. This dish tasted as amazing as it looked. The crab meat was so sweet and paired perfectly with the egg; the shaoxing wine added a wonderful aroma that truly elevated the dish.Second course we had the Lobster with Chilies. At first glance it looked like it would be too spicy to handle as the lobster pieces were swimming in a pool of chopped chilies, but once we tasted it, it turned out to have just the right amount of heat. Our meal ended with the highlight and signature dish - a whole roasted Peking duck. The presentation was very similar to how it was done back in Beijing, but the overall experience felt more polished and sophisticated. The chef came out and carved the duck right in front of us, and the servers covered the table with a spread of sides and condiments. The duck was roasted to perfection and the skin was amazingly crispy.There is no doubt that this restaurant is quite expensive, therefore I think it's best to come for special occasions.

The duck treasures and crispy fish were really good but the fried rice was disappointing and the duck was just okay. Our favorite part was actually the cocktail drinks we ordered, but this place isn't supposed to be a bar.However, for me, the most frustrating part for me of this experience is the design of the space. We were in the second floor main dining area and the bar took up most of the floor. Our table was so small that they had to serve each dish we ordered one at a time! And as a Chinese person who is all about family style dining, this is blasphemy!!! The point of Chinese family style is to have a large spread of food and eat it in any order as you wish, not finish every dish before getting to enjoy the next.

4.0,1/29/2018,"Quick overview: great food, obviously can't live up to the original in Beijing, but pricey for what you're givenWhen I think of DaDong, immediately I remember being in Beijing and having one of the best meals OF MY LIFE. Usually when I eat and I get too full, I start to feel bad about myself and have some tiny semblance of self control. However, for that meal at Beijing's DaDong I literally ate as much as I could possibly eat because I knew the meal I was having was so special. My only regret when looking back is NOT EATING MORE. That's why when I heard DaDong was opening in NYC, I was pumped. Finally I could avenge my regrets from that last meal and maybe live out my truest gorging myself on peking duck dreams!!!!!I went with 7 friends and we ordered 3 ducks ($100 each) with 2 orders zha jian mian ($16 each). We also got two order of their bao. THE BAO WAS SO GOOD - for sure the highlight of the meal. So juicy, super flavorful. Sometimes when you eat, there's a hush around the table while no one talks bc the food is so good. I could've eaten like 20 of those bad boys. The noodles were definitely portioned for one person, or even tapas quantity of food - not the typical portion you'd expect for family style. The noodles themselves were nice and chewy, the meat in the sauce was tender and super flavorful. I guess I was a little underwhelmed by this dish because the quantity was so small. The peking duck was very good! A couple of disappointments: they don't cut the duck in front of you - instead someone cuts it very far away from you at specific points in the room (??). For example, there was someone cutting our duck like 3 tables behind us, so we'd all have to crane our heads and look backwards to see. There was also someone cutting a duck across the bar standing by the elevator (??). One of the best parts of eating peking duck is getting that experience of having it brought and carved right in front of you! I'm not sure why they don't do that, there definitely seems to be enough room. Without all the typical formalities that accompany the peking duck, it's a little disappointing. Also if you're paying $100 per duck, I feel like you're also paying for that whole peking duck experience. Having it occur in random places in the room is kinda awkward and ruins some of the fun of getting a peking duck. Onto the actual taste itself - the peking duck's skin is melt in your mouth fatty, the meat itself is definitely high quality (probably the most high quality duck I've eaten in Manhattan). It comes with wraps and some crunchy buns filled with air, as well as some cucumber, melon, another vegetable I can never identify and a garlic paste. The real hero of the meal was the garlic paste, my entire table gorged ourselves on that and had to deal with the consequences for the rest of the night and the next day.... so flavorful, so sharp, a great way to cut through the richness of the duck. We kept getting more refills of all the wraps, veggies, and garlic paste and they only charged us for one refill (we got at least 5-6 total), which was very nice. The meal itself, quality of the food, etc. was definitely 4 stars, but I'm docking a star for the price.

The skin was crispy but it's like over cooked , we immediately taste the reused oil or burned oil of the duck skin, and the duck leg /thigh was over cooked that it tasted  the burn, butter. and it comes to the inside meat, no taste at all, but it's ok, but not firmed,it's  soft like eating similar texture to cotton or something like really bad graded chicken. Of course we still try to have some bites of it , and bets way to eat their duck is apply a lot of sauce to cover the original taste or the duck, and why would you pay 58$ when you can just donate the money or get a much better Peking duck  easily in Chinatown . Since we couldn't eat the duck, we had to order something safe to eat to overwrite our disappointment of the duck , so we ordered SAFFRON BRAISED BABY CABBAGEwith Chestnuts and the wagyu beef fried rice , both are ages normal, just the wagyu beef didn't taste as wagyu, but normal beef , but how can it go wrong with fired rice and cabbage, and herbs tea was 22$, seriously ! Even you get paid to eat here , do not even try! Services need to be better managed such as serving foods and beverages  in a correct order, they need better management remember which table order what, pay more attention to each table and customer's need, because we are talking about semi fine dining here , not some Togo places . One star i gave to the new building and decor . And cute table setting .",3,0,0,H. G.,"New York, NY",0,8,78
3.0,1/28/2018,"Came here with high expectation. I lived in Beijing for 12 years and I was really excited about DaDong opening in New York. But I have to say I'm not impressed.The rumor about hard to make a table was not true. Maybe for dinner but I was able to get a table easily a week in advance for a weekend lunch table for 4.The food is good not great, the menu is pretty small, not much to choose from, only one vegetable hot dish. So if you come with a big party you might have to just order everything on the menu. The beijing duck was alright, doesn't taste as fresh, the duck was not hot. And they don't do the cutting near you which is a The very interesting thing to watch. They cut them in the back already. Other dishes portion are not big, not quite family style friendly. But taste good.The service was weird, we have about 5 people around us but everyone was just standing around looking at each other. And I even had to wait to get their attention to order food. Needs more training.Overall this place is over priced and they are trying too hard to be upscale which is overkill. If you want to have a five star service this needs to improve.

4.0,1/27/2018,I must say I was pretty sad reading all the reviews knowing that I had a reservation for DADONG. I've been to 3 locations in Beijing and love Duck!  We were greeted on the street level and asked to make our way to the 3rd floor.  The third floor was immaculate.  Beautiful dining hall that was inviting and sophisticated.  Server was very attentive from the start.  I do have to say the food wasn't as good as Beijing but Beijing is a whole other beast.  The China menu is much much more grand and when you think of the spices and quality of Chinese veggies of course it's different!  The food was still wonderful but for cost and taste I dock the restaurant a star.

Other than the very impressive space on the second and third floors of a beautiful building there is nothing positive going on here. Service is disrespectful and chaotic. After checking in on the ground floor you are sent up the elevator to the second floor to wait on a 20+ minute line to check in and be seated. And that is with a reservation! They definitely need a new system to seat their customers. And as for the food, the duck was the worst we have ever had in NYC. There are a hundred restaurants in NY serving more tasty, juicy duck. Da Dong's was over cooked, dry and bland. On a positive note, it eliminated any disappointment that may have arised from them only serving half the meat from the duck.

1.0,1/25/2018,"After read all the less than perfect reviews, my wife and I still decided to go and try this place. First all, it is located behind whole food market, you really don't need to following goole map which is not easy to find. The place is nicely set up, just like most of the restaurants in China these days, we went to 2nd floor, which plays loud techno music ( I am not sure why).  All the dishes come with a big heavy northern style plate, with small portion of food, and large empty space of plate, which looks odd sometime   However, the table is so small, it barely holds up no more than a few plates.  Now, the food, as for the price we paid, it is not a good value, it is as many reviewers pointed out: Over priced. We got a half duck, the meat is tender, but it is rather cold, and lack of flavor, it is slightly above average in quality comparing to the ducks in other place at NYC. We just got back from China two weeks ago, to compare to the ducks we tried there, it is not that good, not many Chinese would go there if this opens in China.We also got fish, egg plant, and pork buns, which are all average at best. The menu is slim down now, after all the reviews in the internet these days, I have give them credit on that. But, the menu is almost like America chinese food you can get in any chinese restaurant in NYC. It loses uniqueness, which I think it is a key to succeed in NYC. It is however in a nice location, you are there not for food, but for location, and setting, that is a sham! Giving, how much $ Chinese have, good and well intention to conquer the world, this is however a disappointment in American food market.My recommendation is the owner and chef should do a tour to try other Peking ducks in north east like DC, etc, and hopefully they would realize the food they bring to nyc is subpar. It is not easy to keep a subpar restaurant going very long in nyc, even with deep pocket of rich Chinese.",2,0,0,DQ F.,"New York, NY",1,44,0
3.0,1/25/2018,"Came here in December and had the tasting menu. Food was good but did not necessarily live up to the price. There were a few service mishaps which likely had to do with learning curve - the meal took over 3 hours even though we started at 10pm. When we asked about the 20+ minute gap between courses, one waiter said he would come back to us then never did. We finally heard back much later and it turns out that one of the sous chefs was out sick and they couldn't find a substitute in time. (We received a lobster dish for our troubles.) At the end, we were incorrectly charged the higher corkage fee (they have a higher corkage fee *per bottle* for groups 8 or larger) until we mentioned it to them.

1.0,1/25/2018,"I'd rate a 0 if I could.Food is really a 4 at the right price, price is really a -3 and overall personal disappointment -1. Was very excited to try based on the Beijing counterpart's reputation -- populist Beijing Duck eatery chain that all folks could eat at, rich and poor, tourists and locals. Setting / Service - Sat on the 2nd floor at the bar, so perhaps others' experiences are different but thought bartender service was good. Restaurant feels like other Asian fusion restaurant / club environments like Tao and Buddakan -- low lighting, loud music, everyone and everything dressed in blackFood - Ordered Geoduck, Abalone Risotto, Pea Shoots and Half Duck. First 3 dishes were good although portions are tiny -- geoduck was a standout (peppercorn with shellfish) and everything else was more or less what you'd expect (e.g., Abalone Risotto = lots of sticky rice which is always satisfying, could barely taste any Abalone just as you'd expect). Duck was extremely disappointing -- a few pieces of skin and a few thin pieces of lean meat. If you were expecting there to be some addt'l option where you get duck soup, extra duck on the side, etc. you'd be disappointed like we were. Price / Portions - Generosity would not be a word I associate with this place. Absolutely terrible pricing. Final price including some tea was $250-300. Not unexpected for Michelin-style cuisine -- extremely unexpected for good not great Chinese fare with a mediocre serving of duck, and tiny portions. In NYC, where you can eat cheap and excellent Chinese food AND have expensive and excellent Chinese food this restaurant does not belong. Not to mention there's other ducks to be eaten (e.g., Decoy).

The duck: I must say I actually enjoy the crispy skins, dipped in sugar; however, the duck meat itself has a weird texture, maybe because it's too dry. In fact, I expected the duck to be much worse after reading all the negative reviews, but really, it's a decent duck. Still, I think ducks at Decoy beat this by a large margin.

2.0,1/20/2018,"2/10 stars in my books. I managed to snatch a reservation up right around the time that DaDong had its grand opening and was shocked 1.5 months later at the 2.5-star review. In a nutshell, the food isn't bad, but for the price, it's certainly not worth it. Took one star off for almost mixing up my coat at the coat check. You'll get a classic Peking duck, but the rest of the menu is clearly filled with Asian fusion items. LOCATION/VENUE: Though New-Yorkers hate venturing to midtown for dinner and the weekends, it's arguably well-located near Times Square and striking distance from Bryant Park. It's right next to the Bryant Park Equinox location should you feel a burning desire to work off the duck after your meal. The venue itself is stunning. There's a grand door at the entrance, and you take an elevator up to the main dining room (like many restaurants in China!). I didn't see the third floor, but the second floor is beautiful. The restaurant is very much centered around a large bar on the second floor. There's also a patio with seating, but I imagine it has yet to be used because there hasn't been warm weather since its opening. I'd like to point out that reservations seemed to fill up ridiculously fast when the reservation system first went up, but there was plenty of space insideTHE FOOD: My friend and I got the Zha Jian Mian ($16) and (of course) a whole duck ($100). I think it was just the right amount of food for two people with a decently big appetite. Should you want to order more dishes off the menu, I highly encourage you to order half a duck. The Zha Jian Mian flavor was on point and was very tasty, but the portion size was RIDICULOUSLY small, especially when this is one of the basic, cheapest dishes in China. My parents would kill me if they knew I pay $16 for about 7 total bites of noodles. The duck itself was served warm to us, but it seems like many other Yelpers have complained about food being served somewhat cold. The second-floor seating layout wasn't conducive to actually seeing the guy cut up the duck, which was a disappointment given that it's a large part of the experience. After they cut the duck up, it's served with garlic mustard, sauce, fresh cucumber shoots, cantaloupe shoots and honeydew shoots. It also comes with a pancake to wrap everything in. They are SO, SO stingy with the pancakes. It costs them pennies to make, but they simply don't provide enough compared to the amount of duck served. We asked 3-4 times for more since they decided bringing 2 out each time was a good idea. It was good, but it doesn't even come close to real Peking duck. I was also disappointed because many Peking-duck places, they will use the leftover parts of the duck to either make a fried rice or soup. I thought that would be offered to us given the whopping $100 paid for the duck, but that wasn't the case. THE SERVICE: Decent. Good, but definitely not great for the size of the check. One thing that really ticked me off was the coat check process. As I was leaving the restaurant and getting ready to give the hostess my coat number, she quickly snatched it out of my hand before I even got the chance to see the number. She took about 4 numbers, quickly rushed to the back and came back out. Unfortunately for a basic bitch like me, there were two black Canada Goose jackets in the batch of four she brought back. LUCKILY one was a medium and another was a small, so it was easy to differentiate, but that just shouldn't be an issue at a high-end restaurant.Will I be back? Perhaps. It's not impossible to get Peking duck in the States, but it's far and few in between.",7,5,1,Peggy W.,"New York, NY",577,248,288
3.0,1/20/2018,"Color me surprised to see DaDong with a 2.5 average on Yelp. Even so, I wanted to come in with a fresh perspective. My friend had made a reservation as soon as they were open, and I landed an invite when she almost forgot about the table she had secured.Starting with the service, since that has been a matter of great debate in these parts. Service was impeccable for us on a Wednesday night. We could have been seated a bit more promptly, but were quickly escorted to our table on the much quieter second level. Our waiter for the night, William, was attuned to our every need and was happy to talk us through the menu and each dish as they arrived. The sommelier was also very professional and helpful.Now for the food, in the order in which it came out:Pan-Seared Pork and Shrimp Steamed Buns (4/5) - Great presentation for a simple staple dish, but in what would become a theme on the night, the taste did not quite meet the visual impact. Cherry Foie Gras (4/5) - Definitely one of the more inspired dishes on the menu, the presentation is almost worth the price itself. The foie gras itself was a bit disappointing, but the mind trickery at play is too fun to resist.Sweet and Sour Pork Ribs (3/5) - Again, the presentation wonderful on a large piece of slate. Flavors did not rise above what you could get for a fraction of the price elsewhere.Steamed Rice with Braised Abalone (4/5) - There should be more abalone on menus. Truffle is the dominant flavor here.Stir-Fried Duck Treasures (4/5) - Presentation is the name of the game here again, as each fried potato nest is literally nestled into a tree.Squid Ink Soup (5/5) - Again, the presence of truffle is unmistakable. One of the better soups I have had, and beautiful to look at yet again.Roast Duck (2/5) - Well prepared, but the duck skin was too dry and potato chip-like for my taste; further, two of our three bamboo steamers of pancakes were dry and cold. Shame.Black Pepper (Kobe) Beef Cutlets (5/5) - Legitimate Kobe beef, not much more to say.Wagyu Beef Fried Rice (5/5) - Fried rice, but elevated - really elevated.As you can see from the numbers, DaDong's offerings have their ups and downs. But when the vaunted duck is unable to shine among the dishes and brings up the rear no less, the rating simply cannot go beyond a 3/5.I should hope that DaDong is experiencing some growing pains. For now at least, consider this place more for a business dinner than a special occasion meal.",2,2,2,Arthur C.,"Manhattan, NY",448,257,54
2.0,1/20/2018,"Pretty rough. The star dish, the duck, was disappointing. The front of house staff are not ready, trained or refined. Lots of bumping into each other, reaching over each other and spillage. Warm wet towel dropped on us. Sugar sprinkled over and on our shoulders while presenting the 'story' of the pork ribs. Coat check misplaced multiple items and took a long time to retrieve anything. Hostesses were fairly gruff at arrival and departure. At this price point you expect better food, more refined service and a better package overall. We did order multiple other dishes which were tasty, well presented and executed but somehow they were all brown with brown sauce - abalone and saffron rice (brown), eggplant tower (brown) and sea cucumber with young wheat (also brown).

(please click helpful)The price here is on the higher end but the decor & settings are very upscale.  You are definitely dinning for the experience and the presentation/taste of the food.  The Peking duck ($98 whole ) is one of the better one that I had in NY , compared to Flushing's Chinatown.  What they do differently here make it stand out is they give you 2 type of breads to try with the duck, one is thin crepe like bread and one is a thin crispy sesame bun  ( see Pics)  The duck as very authentic (not a creation of Asian fusion).  What they did better here is , they cut off the excessive fat off the skin and meat as well.  The Peking Duck here was more delicately prepare then the Flushing comparison (fat on meat,skin ).The vegetable crystal dumplings was good/above average but nothing that blew you away.  I basically would come back here just to experience the upper scale Chinese restaurant.  The food was authentic Chinese but quality did not make me forgot about the price or yearning to come back next week.  Maybe try it once or twice a year as you have out of town guest that want try Peking duck.   The Baked Sole and Kung Pao Shrimp was presented very well , but it was good and not great.  The two dish I would come back for would be the Peking Duck & the Beef Stew ( very tasty and beef was soft and not chewy).Our party tried the Wagyu Beef Fried rice and was happy with the portion and taste.  It was prepared not too oily but rice was moist then what you get a your generic Chinese  Restaurant.I feel you can get similar taste at Queens East Ocean Jewel or Flushing New Mulan on quality of food.  However the Decor and dinning experience Dadong would beat those other restaurant easily.Their outdoor bar area look amazing, and I was talking to my friends to said this will be a good Summer spot to enjoy a drink and a quick appitizersReason for 4 stars and not 5 : upper tier pricing (Avg 40-50 per Entree) & expensive Duck.P.S.  The Chef only do the Duck in front of you during Dinner & not at lunch time.  I booked 2 separate open table booking in 11/2017 for 2 different week in January 2018 and my 1st one was cancelled as reported by fellow yelpers.  My 2nd Reservation for week of 1/20 was good as Dadong called me to confirm.  However, when I try to call them again 2 consecutive days prior to booking just to confirm , no one ever picked up.  Anyway , I took the risk of showing up and was not disappointed.  Everyone in our party enjoyed the high end decor and authentic food.",3,2,0,Jayson C.,"Jamaica, NY",29,186,454
4.0,1/20/2018,"People seem to love hating on this place because their expectations weren't met. I'm not sure what expectations those are because it seems unfair to expect Chinese food to always be cheap. For a ""nice"" NYC restaurant, there's nothing unusual about this pricing. I should note I came here with low expectations after reading a ZERO star review from nymag (iirc). Verdict on that review: bullshit. Ok, on to the actual food. It was good. Was it 3x better than the local noodle or dumpling shop (since this was 3x the price ish)? No. But, it was good on an absolute basis. I guess lucky for Chinese food in nyc that even the cheap stuff is excellent.  I would love to come here on an expense account because on an absolute basis, it is better quality, more elegantly presented, in some ways tastier food. Just that the competition for the same food genre is much cheaper so in your mind there's always a ""hmmm."" Thus, I won't be coming back if I'm paying. However, it was still an overall 4* experience. Specifically re: The Peking duck. Ok look, the duck was really good. But no two way service was my biggest gripe. I want my duck carcass soup!!!

1.0,1/17/2018,"This is probably one of the worst dinners I've had at such a supposedly renowned restaurant. The food was edible yet it did not live up to the expectation. As someone who grew up eating Beijing duck, they did not do it justice, especially at such a high price. The proportions of pancake vs. duck did not make sense. We had so much duck and barely any pancakes to wrap it around. The service was extremely slow. We arrived at 6:30 pm and our main dishes still had not arrived at 8:00 pm. The tables were also extremely uneven and unbalanced. The music also had bass that was way too strong for a nice dinner vibe. There was also random flashing at intervals. It was strange. The only consoling factor was the free wifi. The fried rice was extremely dry and hard. I couldn't taste the beef at all - it was just grain and oil at this point. When we got the ZhaJiang Noodles, it looked likee the noodles came straight out of a ramen packet. The entire dish was so so salty to the point of sour. It felt like I was eating way too much MSG. One of the waiters couldn't understand us when requested for more pancakes after such a disastrous start. That same waiter even spit on a minor. Furthermore, the other waiter even spilled the additional pancakes on my other friend. It turned out they only gave us four more when we still had half a duck to finish. I have no idea what the management for this restaurant was thinking, hiring barely trained people to serve. The waiters simply had no idea how to treat customers. They should not be employed. He asked to clear our plates when we were clearly in the middle of finishing a dish. He straight up stopped us with food in our mouths. After clearing our plates, the waiters also intruded on our personal space trying to clean the table. He was literally an inch from my friend's face as he attempted to wipe the table. Do they not understand the concept of cleaning the table AFTER the customers leave?When I went in the bathroom, I honestly had the worst experience ever. The water pressure was so high that when I watched my hands, the water sprayed all over my shirt and pants.

3.0,1/16/2018,"Went to Da Dong for dinner in December.  There were some hiccups with reservations, but since they were a new restaurant I would cut them some slack on this.  Of course, people should rightfully expect these kinks to go away over time.Food: we ordered a whole duck, as well as a bunch of other dishes.  As some other reviewers mentioned, the cherry foie gras was very good.  Two other dishes also stood out as phenomenal: the vegetable dumplings, as well as their Zhajiang (soy bean paste) noodles.  The remaining dishes tasted okay; nothing memorable but not terrible either.Taste aside, there was however one thing we weren't very happy about nearly across the board: portions were just way too small, to the point where some dishes were getting difficult to share.  For the lofty prices they charge (our bill came to approx. $100 per person excluding alcohol), they could have made their offerings feel more generous. On to the duck: there was no execution error with ours - skin was perfectly crisp and the meat was tender; no issues with the meat being too dry or overcooked.  It was a fine peking duck, but didn't stand out from others I've tried both here and in Asia.  And that's a problem - $98 was a bit much for a good-but-not-great peking duck.  And if Dadong's management is reading this: for a $98 duck, please don't be so stingy about the pancakes!  The portion of pancakes we received was just way too small. Service: we experienced no service issues.  Our server was friendly, professional and attentive.  The food did take slightly long to come out, but it wasn't as terrible as some other reviewers have experienced.  Our dinner lasted approx. two and a half hours, which is not unusual for a nice dinner in NYC.One last thing: the restaurant feels uncomfortably packed, even for NYC standards.  The spacing between tables is among the worst I've seen in NYC.  I understand they needed to squeeze every bit of revenue out of that expensive space, but at some point it starts to have a negative impact on customer experience, and they are way past that point.  When people go out for a nice dinner, they expect not just good food, but a nice environment in which one could comfortably enjoy the food.  Da Dong seems to have forgotten about the latter.so overall I'd say 3 stars: good food but expensive/portions too small; service was fine for us, but the space was too packed and quite uncomfortable.",2,0,0,CY C.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,6,0
3.0,1/16/2018,"DaDong was one of the meals I was truly looking forward to but fell short. If you're doing a quick read, it's not horrible as some say but it's pricey. I'd come back but not necessarily in a rush to. You'll get good food with meh  service.It's a bit hard to find. It's in the courtyard that cuts through between West 41st and 42nd Streets. For the party people, it's the area with the benches to the right of Circle.The restaurant itself is beautiful but it feels like any other corporate Midtown restaurant. I also wasn't a fan of the high top tables, a small section has normal tables but most of them are high tops. For the amount of money you'll spend here, I'd like a larger table and more comfortable seating. The seats were so tight that my girlfriend was constantly getting bumped into and staff kept asking her to move closer in.Service-wise, they fell quite short and they have a large team here. Her Malbec came and the server who brought it mentioned to another colleague to get a red glass. A glass for the wine finally came when our server noticed it about 8 minutes later. Our server seemed to be quite disinterested for most of our interactions, he also seemed displeased we didn't get some of the pricier items.We got the Cherry Foie Gras appetizer, it was four ""cherry"" foie gras next to four actual cherries. The foie gras was excellent and I appreciated the acidity of the real cherries to help with the richness.Be sure to order some additional items because the duck is the last thing you'll get. Ours took about 45 minutes to arrive. I was offered the Steamed King Crab which looks awesome in pictures but be aware that the Market Price is around $200 I've heard/read.. for half. I declined the other recommendation which was the Braised Abalone with Italian Risotto at $100. The Steamed Rice with Braised Abalone at $36 was not available they said. That seemed odd to me considering another two dishes with braised abalone were available. I wanted to give the server a Star Wars moment. The Upsell is strong in you, young padawan.We opted for the Wagyu Beef Fried Rice as one of their Staple items. Not bad but felt it was lacking salt and flavor. We also ordered the Baked Chilean Seabass, glad I did. This by far was the star for me. Clay pot brought with tender flaky seabass atop scallions, garlic and ginger. I don't remember the last time I ate so much garlic but blackened garlic is just so good! I used the leftover burnt garlic with the fried rice.Their flagship dish, the DaDong ""Su Bu Ni"" Roast Duck - went for the whole. Unless you'll eat ONLY the duck, get some other items and get the half. Came with super thin pancakes and a single sesame bun plus usual fixings. The duck was sliced by the elevator which I was disappointed about, this is probably due to the tight seating I mentioned. They also slice the sides off, so if you like the fattier top of the duck like I do - you won't get that part. The skin was super crispy and the fat was removed. Likewise, the duck slices themselves were not fatty at all. It was a bit dry for my taste but I also tend to eat more of the Cantonese Roast Duck which is much heavier in flavor. If you like lean duck, you'll enjoy this very much.All in all, I don't regret going to DaDong but I went in expecting something much more. I don't love the layout and maybe that can be changed but the service has to get better here. DaDong has the grandeur of a restaurant that feels like it is striving for that Michelin feel but just never gets off the ground. Poor/inconsistent/nonexistent service, sloppy timing on the dishes coming out and just doesn't make you feel good about the money you spent.For what it's worth, we'd definitely comeback for the seabass but that's about it.",1,3,1,Patrick W.,"New York, NY",226,178,709
3.0,1/16/2018,"My Dadong visit was similar to the reviewers' here on yelp:1. Cramped space: Table is small, and spacing between tables is tight. I feel bad for the servers who need to walk pass the tables frequently. And I didn't feel like I was dining in a high end restaurant in NYC2. Duck was actually fine for us. Yes it was less fatty, but it was hot with steam when it was served. Cherry foie gras was good. Zhajiang noodles and veggie steamed buns were good as well. Duck treasure and pan fried bun only so so. The colorful plain steam buns were disappointing. Also we felt Dadong was nickel and dime-ing us when they charged us for extra pancakes for the duck. Plus portions are small3. Service was good, except they seemed rush to take plates away when they weren't finishedGiven the money we spent, I was hoping for a much better experience. I do not mind going again, but definitely will not return in the near future. Perhaps Dadong is not targeting the locals here in NYC but the Chinese tourists who are visiting Times Square and want to eat Chinese food",0,0,0,K Y.,"Manhattan, NY",0,22,8
1.0,1/16/2018,"BIG DISAPPOINTMENT!!! (I hope DaDong read this post, and improve please!). This place receives such low reviews for a reason, and now I will share why...-The host couldn't find our reservation, we gave them three different names to try, and they eventually found the reservation with the first name we gave them.  We were embarrassed in front of our guests because we thought we weren't able to dine there.-When we got to second floor, the host told us to wait for 5 minutes because the table was paying and being cleaned.  20 minutes past our reservation time, we were still waiting!  -Coat check: seriously, how can this take forever to do!????  The host told us that the server will take our coats when we get seated, which wasn't true.  The server brought us to our seat and left immediately.  After asking for coat check many times, they finally did it! -The server gave us little time to decide what to order.  We had 5 people, and had to share 3 menus.  We were asked to order 5 minutes after sitting down, and once again 3 minutes later. We felt rushed. There were no recommendation or any explanation of the menu by our server either!-They sat the 5 of us in a small round table.  We can only have one dish at a time.  We felt rushed to finish our food so the next dish can be served. We had little time to actually savor and enjoy the food and have a nice conversation with each other. There were still a few pieces of fish fillet left in the dish, and the server asked us to finish it so he could serve the next dish.  (WHAT!!!!)Let's talk about FOOOOOOD!-DaDong in Beijing is way better than here!  Here the portions are small and mediocre in quality.-We asked if they make soup from what's leftover of the roast duck after carving, and the server replied ""no"" with a little bit of an attitude, as if that's an unusual request.Now I get why we can make reservation the same day for party of 5!  Bad quality, awful service, and way too overpriced!",2,1,1,Brandy C.,"Virginia Beach, VA",790,652,468
2.0,1/16/2018,"Walking into the main door (the entry is East wall btw 6th/7th in the second building away from 6th Av, with a door guy (who didn't open the door), they direct you to use the elevators. Second floor for the a la carte, and third for the tasting menu (much more expensive).Second floor in, and as you walk in you're greeted with a massive bar and a chandelier of various glass/bronze pipes at the ceiling. This is a place where Lu Yan would have probably fit in - the modern music synthesizing around the updated decor, a wonderful looking outdoor space with water and a bar, closed due to the cold, and dining scattered around the back right side. Turn right for the check-in and coat-check. The area around the bar is littered with tables, but you need reservations. Bar seating is the only flexible option. At the bar, ordered ""Enter the Dragon"" - cool to watch dry ice misting over, but be careful or you could frost-burn your lips. The straw was frozen solid into the drink, though, so that saved me from embarrassment in an early exit. Stopped by the bathrooms - which are hidden behind a door with no label and you may find yourself walking to the kitchen instead if you miss the turn. Unisex, small, but works. Overall the space is tall, but overall the placement and scale of objects and people were badly done. The bar is too big, getting in its own way, and the spacing between tables is too small; constantly being bumped into at the bar while we waited as people were being seated, or servers walking through. The tables themselves were small; too small for efficient use given the mass of plating, little ducks to put your chopsticks and spoons on, and the multiple glasses for water and wine that may make your way to the table. More than one dish? Good luck fitting that onto the round tables unless you're a small group of two - we were a group of five, and even four at the table would have been trying; other tables I looked at had dish placement issues. Other tables longer and square would've been a better option. Servers constantly having to excuse themselves as they go around serving people - not the way to do it if you're going to do dishes French style with portions that were small.Service - hit and miss. More than once they gave sparkling water to those of us having flat, and bringing out the wrong wine glasses initially (and taking them before filling fortunately), and two people trying to fill the wine glass in a row when declined the first time - organization needs some work here. Shared plates like the big stone spicy beef should come with some serving utensils. Small replacement plates came semi-regularly. We had to ask for more of the small flat pancakes. Again, too small for comfort on the table, crammed in and was too warm overall. The servers in the back dropped things too frequently, and the food came out irregularly - we ended up canceling part of the meal because it took so long, and the waitress was reprimanded more than once due to the slowness of the service - by both the Lady at the table, and the sauve CT gentleman with a non-200-car garage more forcibly... The second time included a comment that she wondered if we wanted our other food to come out.... um... yes?On to the food most dishes were good to sample for 1-2 people. If more than that, I'll make a note. Geoduck with peppercorn was ok; could've used more time marinating but the presentation was nice in the ice bowl.  Spicy & sour cucumbers were done well. Probably second best dish this night. Cherry foie gras specialty of the chef - interesting, but I'm not much for cold foie gras. Would've been better over hot toasted; 4 pcs & 4 cherries (some of the cherries had seen better days).Hot dishes - the Song Shu Crispy Whole Fish (branzino) was good - sweet and sour, cooked crispy with cantaloupe balls and some pine nuts. Probably the best dish of the night. Red chili sliced short rib was on the massive stone plank that took up the table. Maybe...15-18 small inch long slices of short rib total, and mostly peppers and onions. Not worth it.Crystal buns - too salty. Pan-seared definitely not Shanghai sen jian bao. Skip. Cold avocado noodles had a good sauce. The duck we ordered two; half was served to us, and 45+ min later, 2nd half (of another duck) was given to us. That left about 20 minutes in the middle where we were drinking wine and wondering where our food was. Canceled the 2nd due to the wait. 3 ways to eat it, but best is still pancakes + sauce + scallion+cucumber (the canteloupe slices added color).Overall, missed opportunity to do great - too much not working right and pacing was terrible, out of order, poor spacing in the restaurant, and service needs to be hammered out, all for far too expensive of an experience (as compared with the one in China which is more casual). Maybe I'll be back one day, but it won't be soon and it won't be my first choice.",6,2,4,Hank C.,"Jersey City, NJ",1732,2830,1188

5.0,1/16/2018,"My husband and I are raised in Beijing. Both of us were happy about the roast duck at dadong, and we had a very nice dinner experience based on what we ordered that night.Authentic Peking roast duck is different than duck in Hong Kong style which is more often seen in NY. So I'm very satisfied to eat the real Peking roast duck here as I'm from Beijing. The duck, the sauce and the pancake are three important elements for Peking roast duck. There are many so-called Peking roast duck in New York but I have no willing to try, because even the food picture can show me they are strange and not authentic (to native Beijinger). For example the China town one use the Peking duck name but staff there even don't know what's the correct sauce (甜面酱) for Peking roast duck. I have no idea why many reviews said dadong duck is too dry, maybe dadong has improved this part. We ordered one whole roast duck, everything is good, only the pancake is surely not enough to the duck, so we have to order extra pancake for $5; sauce was enough.We did many research and we are not big fan of dadong's new modern Chinese dish. Maybe just personal taste, I think these cuisine have beauty in appearance but not sure about their true spirit inside. I guess it's also the reason why dadong in NY has so many negative reviews now. We ordered one whole roast duck, cherry foie gras (find out we don't like the taste of cold foie gras) and Beijing traditional dessert, which is interesting but very tiny, you can find larger nicer cheaper real Beijing snack dessert in Flushing Queens (盛津早餐的驴打滚).Based on what we ordered and experienced at dadong, both of us were very happy and will come back for more Peking roast duck; and try Songshu Fish next time, which is another great dish I miss so much but rare to find authentic in NY.",0,0,0,Xiaoxiao T.,"New York, NY",73,1,0

1.0,1/15/2018,"Came here for the duck, left disappointed and broke. 4 of us dined there recently, and things went downhill as soon as we ordered a bottle of wine.   Wine was never presented to us, or even offered a taste before it was poured out and distributed to the table. Ordered a series of dishes and they came out in a haphazard manner, to the point where there wasn't event any room left for them to place them down.  The cabbage 2 ways is a ridiculously small portion or cabbage, probably 6 cork size pieces (and thats generous.)The fried whole fish, while technically was done really well, the sticky sweet sauce totally washed out any flavor of the fish and it could have been chicken nuggets underneath the sauce instead of fish and you couldn't have even realized.Lastly, the duck.  Oh the duck.   I wanted to like you so much.   It was as if you took a duck skin, crisped it to the point of no return and then laid it on top of some meat that at one point probably was duck, but now resembled dry duck scented sawdust.Very disappointing - especially at the price.   For the ~500 for the 4 of us, we could have had duck that actually probably resembled a duck at numerous other places in NYC 4 or 5 times over.

1.0,1/14/2018,"First of all, we are Chinese from Hong Kong, so I could say I know what real Chinese food taste like. Some dishes have a good authentic flavor to it, but it is either the culinary skill that is missing (overcooked, or not timed right), or the ingredients were not good (some of the diced duck tasted foul, it wasn't fresh).The portions are small. It is normally not what I would write (please we dine at Per se I know what small serving is), but Chinese dine family style and share plates together, I think they can price the dishes more expensive and have a slightly larger servings. Since we go as a group of 5 - most of the dishes can serve only 1 to 1.5 (small eaters) the most. The server didn't say anything about it; if he asked us we should double up any dishes so that we can all have a taste, we would have totally done it - but nothing was mentioned and half of us didn't get to try everything. It felt like we were rationing, and that is not a very elegant feeling to have things that can't be shared by everyone - and not know about it beforehand! The management/ staff was rude. I have a 5 years old, who - goes to a private nursery school in NYC, most of the 5 years old who goes to private nursery school in NYC knows what a sharp knife is, and used one in school (and home too)! and if I am OK with him staying in front of the chef while he is slicing the duck, I know he is OK. If any mom freaks out with their kids watching the chef slices the duck, they would have taken their kids out, ALREADY. However, someone without elegance, and common sense - asked the ladies in my table (just me and my sister so there wasn't any embarrassment but it was just so classless) and asked whoever the kids belong to, please take him away (but my server told me earlier that we can go watch the chef as he slices our duck) because she doesn't want him to get cut. I want to ask - who is going to cut him, the chef is the only one who has a knife, and he supposes to be the master of a knife?  Sorry that itself totally ruined my dinner.I would go back to Hakkasan anytime, especially after tonight, I will go to Hakkasan tomorrow. I was so excited that I can go elsewhere because we get bored with just 1 goable restaurant that serves decent Chinese food. This place is lite up well and I love the vibe, I was so excited and hoped that we would fall in love with DD, but we can't - even though I am desperate to love a high quality Chinese place, but this would not do.In conclusion, I asked the other 2 adults that we had dinner tonight. out of the 3 of us, 2 would NOT come back even for the duck. However, I love the duck because it is lean and not greasy, but I won't put up with the service, and 2 other adults vowed no so we will not come back. The rest of the dishes have a 2-3 stars out of 5.

5.0,1/13/2018,"I am from Beijing, born and raised there. Peking Duck is the only duck dish I like, and the only place I like to go to is Dadong in Beijing, I tried all different Peking Duck restaurants in Beijing, old ones or new ones....nothing can beat Dadong's Duck unless you like the duck meat with a lot fat on, then Dadong is not your kinda place. I gave 5 stars not because this place is flawless, there are issues need to be addressed....but in terms of the food, I say it's excellent. Duck is great, meat is lean and skin is crispy. The menu is not as big as the one you get in Beijing, and more dishes towards fusion food....But they definitely have some traditional Beijing dishes on there. We tried 5-courses tasting menu, 90% of them are great. The main reason we go there is the duck, as long as the duck is the same quality, then I am all good.....we talked to our waiter, he said the chef brought his own breed to the US from Beijing. That's what makes it good. How I like to eat it is, I dip the tip of each piece into the sauce, then use the duck to spread it on the thin bread, then add vegetables, last step is roll it up. This way you won't have too much sauce in each bite, also won't be too salty. Since the sauce give all the flavors, so the duck itself doesn't have too much flavor, otherwise your duck will be way too salty to eat. We only ordered two other dishes from the regular menu, my favorite lotus root with sticky rice and sweet and sour cucumber, they both taste exactly the same as the ones you get in Dadong Beijing. That's why I say this place is very authentic, there is no other places you can get this quality Peking duck. Some people say if you want Peking duck, go to Chinatown or flushing, I am telling you, you won't find it. Those roasted ducks in Chinatown is all made by Southern style cooking,not Peking duck.

Most dishes are glorified Chinese food tailored to unknowing customers (A few examples, the fried fish was basically just general taos chicken but replaced with fish, the waygu beef fried rice had no flavor, the caviar for the duck is underwhelming and did not add any more to the flavor)Price is 2 out of 5 stars. Most dishes for the quality and taste are at most $5-20 per dish at other restaurants. However, as mentioned previously, the dishes are glorified and marked up 3x-5x. The add-ons like caviar, waygu, and others were ways for them to get customers to spend more money (to be underwhelmed for add-ons that cost $50-$200).Service is 0 out of 5 stars. The manager in the blue suit on the chef tasting floor was rude and disrespectful. My wife and I ordered $400+ worth of food to try and take home. The manager at various occasions talked under his breath with other servers about why we would order a whole duck and various other items for just two people. He also was looked for opportunities to not serve us, as we tried to get his attention he would just walk right past us.Separately, we had a lot of left over food and had asked the staff to pack them for us. We were given a bag full of boxes on our way out. However, when we got home, we r we realize most boxes were half empty and they had forgotten half the items we didn't even touch during our meal (probably costing us $100-$150).This place is basically using the big brand name to defraud New Yorkers, people from the area and tourists. The location and renovation costs are pushed onto the customers to bear (in the form of glorified chinese food and expensive appetz and add-ons worth less than 1/5 of its cost).If you're looking for great Peking Duck and Chinese food, skip this place and head to Chinatown or flushing.

I was really holding back on writing this review, but due to lack of response from the restaurant, here it is.The restaurant is absolutely beautiful.  The main floor has cool vibes and would be the perfect place to hang out with friends on the weekends.  The outdoor space looks amazing too whenever it opens.  We actually dined on the chef's tasting floor, which was really modern classy and has private space for groups in an intimate setting.  Too bad the ambiance of the whole restaurant is tainted by the poor service (most wait staff were good) and the less than memorable food. My husband and I ordered the duck, the fish, and the wagyu fried rice.  -The complimentary manto breads were good with the three different tasting sauces they provided.  Truffle oil is great.-The duck was a real disappointment as this is why we came here and what the restaurant is known for. The skin is crispy, that's for sure. However, it seemed that the skin was so crispy that the meat inside became dry and tasteless.  The caviar wasn't great with the duck either and seemed like just a foo-foo add on to the meal.  What a bummer.  -The fish looked great, but was so fried that you couldn't really taste anything but sweet and sour sauce-Wagyu fried rice - tasteless :(Lose!So now onto the service...-Maître D' or chef's tasting floor manager was rude and condescending.

No acknowledgement.  That's fine, because here's your 1 star reward that you deserve.  Congratulations! It's sad since we were super excited for the opening of this restaurant and yet it's a waste of beautiful space.  You're better off getting duck in Chinatown. Duck is juicier and more flavorful.

3.0,1/11/2018,"First off, let's talk about finding this place. Google maps won't help you on this one. In fact, it'll take you on circles. DaDong is not located in Bryant Park but in a pavilion/courtyard located behind Whole Foods. Once you're there, you won't miss it. We got the chef's tasting which is on the third floor. There's a choice between 5 courses or 7 courses and 2 supplements are available. The two menus are pretty different from what I could tell. There's an A5 wagyu and caviar supplement on both. We went with the 7 course and wagyu. So I ordered sparkling water and a bottle of wine. These guys apparently charge for sparkling. I mean, what fancy restaurant still charges for sparkling nowadays? Especially when it's clearly produced inhouse. Let's discuss the bread. It's homemade but looks like Wonder bread. It's served with 3 sauces: truffle, black bean, and hot chili oil. Those that know me knows I love chili oil, but how is that a bread sauce?The foie gras was oxidized and gray. It tasted fine but didn't look great. And they didn't even bother to pit the real cherry. The uni was fresh and declious. It was Santa Barbara. The foam hot and sour soup was good but there was one measly piece of scallop in the entire cup. And it was poorly cut and mishapped. The A5 wagyu was tender and soft like butter. However it was cooked fully through which I personally feel was a sin on A5 meat. There was also so many chilis on the plate. The duck. This is supposed to be the best Peking duck place in the world and the draw to the restaurant. Verdict: it was just okay. The skin is on point. Crispy and airy. But the duck is way too lean. I mean, where's the duck fat? You need a fatter duck. Lastly, that dessert was a throw away.

4.0,1/10/2018,"First off I want to put out there that the Dadong in NYC is a FUSION restaurant like a Budakkan. Do not go here expecting traditional Chinese fare. I think that might be some of the disappointments from previous reviews because they expect it to be exactly like the Beijing restaurant. It's smart of the owner to do it this way from a business perspective since the area is mostly finance and law firms and most Americans haven't actually had traditional Chinese food (just what they think is Chinese). Also unlike other reviews, I think for the area, the price point is not bad. Other restaurants in the area are around the same price point. As for the food we got the cherry foie gras which I definitely recommend. It's foie gras with a soft sugar coating that is made to look like a cherry. We also got braised eggplant and zhajian noodles. Zhajian noodles I've had my entire life. They're eaten in Northern China as well as Korea. These noodles were okay. The sauce could be a little more flavorful. As for the duck- it came out nice and warm, with crispy skin. Dadong is known for their lean duck but I think a little fat never hurt anyone! It would be slightly better with some fat on it instead of no fat at all since fat does make meat more juicy but it was definitely not dry as per previous reviews. They also offered sugar and garlic to dip the duck skin with. We really liked the sugar with the skin, sweet/ salty combination. Oh and there was no extra charge when we asked for extra pancakes.Service: Our waiter was very nice and engaging and waters were filled and napkins folded when I went to the bathroom. The restaurant itself had a lot going on. They had about 30 employees JUST on the 2nd floor, I've never seen so much staff in one restaurant and I didn't even see the 3rd floor. They also had chefs carving the ducks on the floor for show. I guess it would be entertaining to some but I think they can do away with this since there isn't much room on the floor itself. The dress code: Dadong is an upscale restaurant. They even have a doorman to open the main door for you. They have 6 dishes that were $98 and above. Do not wear your sweatshirt and sneakers here! This place is business casual and some guys had suit jackets on. I couldn't believe some diners were wearing a T-shirt or looked like they rolled out of bed. The workers aren't snotty about the dress code but I have to say something. If you wouldn't wear it to an upscale French restaurant then don't wear it to an upscale Chinese restaurant!There were some little things here and there like we waited for a bit for the duck to get to our table. I'm sure after a couple of months these things will be ironed out.In summary if you like crispy lean duck with Chinese fusion cuisine then try Dadong. If you're looking for traditional cheap Chinese food then go to Flushing.",2,1,0,B L.,"Manhattan, NY",1,9,9
1.0,1/10/2018,"Well, it wasn't good. First of all, the space was ok pretty, and the bar area was full of accounting/mid management professions. I asked to be switched to upstairs for the chef's table as there was a screaming family of small children at the next table.  chef's menu was $130-$170 per person, which was not too high for nyc. I would have been willing to pay more if i could have been served FOOD. Each course took about an hour to come. I was so hungry and drunk by the time the first course came, that i didnt even see any food on my plate served. NO JOKE, i thought they had brought me an empty plate and i started laughing and thinking it was a joke, but the dish was THAT SMALL!!! The dish was so tiny that i didn't think it was for real.  Then the fun began...Each course kept getting smaller, kobe beef was 2 tiny cubes. At one point, they brought on an empty bowl for the soup. Before they poured the soup, i literally thought, wow, they've done it, they finally made this course so small i cannot find it. To my surprise, they poured some black semi warm soup in there. The tiny little white noodles in the black soup look like tiny little worms.The duck guy took literally an hour to carve a stupid duck. By the time he was done, the duck was ice old. I mean where did they find these guys to carve ducks???? The whole diner was so foolish it was funny. My entire chef's selection took about 3 hours,  i was so famished i cared very little about how the food would actually taste. Terrible service from reservation to kitchen. I had to tell the server to skip the deserts because i just couldn't take the space any longer. Seriously, at this point, who cares about stupid chocolates?! Get me out of here, because i need to find the nearest pizza joint asap! Anyway, my bill over over $1k for 3 people for a few bites of food, my mom laughed so much because the food was that pathetic. so i guess it's kind of worth it to see my mom(lives in china and regular at the dadong shanghai) laughing at me that hard for being an total idiot for coming here. ergh...it's so bad. ha! Skip it! this place is offensive!i've never said this before on yelp, jbut people who think this place was good clearly have never had nicer chinese food. try panda express.

The Beijing noodles were excellent, nicely chewy and the sauce was delicious. The big disappointment was the portion size versus price. 2 ounces of wagyu or 4 little 2 bites duck treasures is not a main course. The 2 of us left hungry after 6 dishes and 2 deserts.

4.0,1/10/2018,"I came to DaDong in one of their first weeks open with high expectations as I had been reading about this restaurant opening for sometime.The biggest anticipation was the Peking Duck. I am a massive fan of Peking Duck, and could not wait to taste what is supposed to be the best.The Venue is large, and is very modern. There are a lot of different types of seating options between booths, tables, high tables, and a Bar. We came on a mid week night with a late reservation so we got a great table.The wait staff is ver knowledgable of the menu and can explain or suggest anything that you may need. Because of the size of the location, or potentially other reasons, I found that the service was on the slow side, as well as a little unorganized. The food comes out kind of whenever things are ready. We were served the Duck before the pork and shrimp buns, which would typically be an appetizer.The food was good, not necessarily great, but definitely an experience. Some things were better than others. The duck was definitely good, but I have had better honestly. What was interesting about it though was the presentation and the wraps were very thin. I like that they let you make your own.The best thing hands down on this menu is the Songshu Crispy Fish. This is honestly the one thing that blew me away. The presentation was tops and it was probably the best asian fish dish I have ever had in my life. This one dish showed me why people rave about this place.In conclusion, come here expecting to spend a lot. Also, come here expecting to try things you normally wouldn't, as there is sure to be a dish on this menu that will give you a reason to justify spending the big bucks. The Duck is solid don't get me wrong, but in the end Peking duck is Peking duck, its not going to blow you away or be different from other high ends ducks you have had in the past.",5,0,1,Ross H.,"New York, NY",362,105,436
3.0,1/9/2018,"We came here and ordered the whole duck, crispy whole fish, pea sprouts, and wagyu beef fried rice.  The duck was as expected, and served with thin pancake skins, puffed sesame buns-not so much buns, think Indian poori, duck sauce, and sugar and garlic dips, with green onion, radish, cucumber on the side.  The sides to the duck added a bit of uniqueness to this dish compared to ducks elsewhere.  The fish was comparable to any other good restaurant but not heads and shoulders above the rest.  The pea sprout dish was small but the tough stems were all removed and only the leaves with some thin stems were served.  The fried rice was just OK.The service was really good.  We thought food came out in a timely manner.  Our glasses were always kept full.  Bathroom was spotless.  The three of us were full at the end and stayed about 2 hours.  The price was probably twice as much as a quality Chinese restaurant but then you're probably not dining near Bryant Park in a spotless restaurant with great service.  Was it worth the price to pay for the setting and service for food that is somewhat better than a good restaurant in Flushing or Chinatown?  Not sure",0,0,0,H T.,"San Jose, CA",8,11,0
3.0,1/8/2018,"Agree that most of the people giving one star probably didn't come in with the expectation of DaDong being one of the highest end Chinese restaurants (definitely $$$$ for a complete meal). The service is fairly slow, which would stretch dinner to around 2 hours. It is obvious that DaDong makes an effort to be considered high end based on how many dishes use expensive ingredients like truffle and saffron.

1.0,1/7/2018,"What a sad sad disappointment... everything that could go wrong has gone wrong with this restaurant. The one star I'm giving is only for the decoration inside. The place is very beautiful and there is an outdoor area but you missed the point of a restaurant- it should be about FOOD. I'm even putting the horrible service aside starting from checking coats- lost my friend coat, knocked over my friend bag while serving food then said it's ok without picking it up. The food is just horrific. If you live in New York and tried other Chinese/ Chinese fusion restaurants before you came in to DaDong with a standard. Even if my standard was pretty low when I saw all the yelp reviews, this restaurant blows. They tried too hard to change things that are unnecessary and tried to create new flavors that are not even good. We had their sweet and sour ribs-which the portion is like 5 small pieces on a giant stone plate and they put so much sugar powder on it that it was so sweet. Then the duck we had was so so bad. The meat is very mushy tasted like frozen food reheated from a microwave. It also took the chef so long to cut the duck that it was cold by the time it got to the table. Seriously, hire a professional chef who knows how to cut ducks should be very easy. Then we had the fried fish with sweet sauce which was probably the only dish that was ok (mind you the 60 bucks for the ok fish). We also had kungpao chicken and jajungmian. HOW DO YOU EVEN MESS these two dishes up? Kungpao chicken tasted like sweet and sour chicken with only 10 pieces of chicken... jajungmian which is a noodle dish with black bean sauce tasted so bad that I was saying I can cook better than this omg. Why on earth would you only care about presentation of the food and totally neglect the TASTE of the food? People go to a restaurant to eat for the TASTE. Yes service counts but if you have ok food and amazing service people would still give you 3 stars. The food here was not even ok just edible and overpriced plus the service was so horrific that I don't ever want to return. Please change your manager and the whole staffs. Consider hire someone professional that had restaurant management experiences!",5,1,2,Callie S.,"New York, NY",133,122,494
1.0,1/6/2018,"When I heard that DaDong was coming to NYC I was excited since I had previously been to DaDong in Beijing and it had blown me away. So it really pains me that this was probably the most fully bungled restaurant visit I've ever had and not just at this price point. It's easiest to use a list:1) We reserved a table here for around Christmas on Opentable, thinking that it'd be a nice Christmas meal. DaDong waited until a few days before our reservation to tell us that they were cancelling the reservation. First time a restaurant has done this to us. 2) We rebooked got to the restaurant on a cold winter day. First thing we're told is that they can't yet check our coats because they ran out of space. Instead of just quietly stashing the coats in a back room somewhere and handling it, they blame this on ""all the customers wearing two coats each."" They freed up space as folks left and about half an hour later and took our coats from our dining table. Another first for a restaurant.3) Peking Duck-for some background-at DaDong in Beijing there's a stage area where you see ducks being roasted over flaming wood-the roasting area is encased in glass and it's a work of art. You can pick a duck and the duck is brought to you when it's done and carved tableside. Here you don't get to see ducks roasting which is mildly disappointing, but more inexplicably they carved our duck on the other side of the restaurant and offered to let us walk across the restaurant to go awkwardly stand by another table and watch our duck get carved? Meanwhile they carved another table's duck next to us then pointed the duck out to them from across the room-wtf? The duck itself was reasonably good for the leaner style DaDong is known for. But as other reviewers have mentioned they will inexplicably explain that there are legal liability issues with giving you the duck bones, even though literally every single other restaurant in the entirety of NYC can sell you a chicken or duck with bones in it somehow. This lead to complete disbelief from a Chinese friend who was dining with us, since it's tradition to take the duck bones home to make duck broth/soup with.4)Other food-Sizzling sliced short ribs was a dish that literally everyone at the table complained about. A stir fried boneless short rib dish sauteed with leeks. Which would have been great if they hadn't dumped what an entire cup of sesame oil into the stir fry. Sesame oil burns quickly and this dish was filled with the overwhelming taste of burnt sesame oil. There was also a sour taste which made it seem like the oil was rancid, though apparently according to our server they had added vinegar. Our server also stated that it was supposed to be a sweet and sour sauce but there was zero sweetness, only rancid greasiness. The Wagyu Beef fried rice just seemed like a waste of expensive Wagyu-the beef pieces are relatively small as others have mentioned but this is because Wagyu is full of fat that melts when you cook it, so this infuses the rice with beef fat-which sounds like a good idea except here it just tastes like greasy soy sauced fried rice and is an utter waste of Wagyu beef. Other dishes tasted like they should but why pay out the nose for Zhajiangmian/Jajangmyeon when you can get an excellent version at numerous Korean restaurants around the city for a few bucks!? The Cherry Foie gras had a very nice presentation but it tasted like balls of plain foie gras served with cherries to me.5) Service-our waitress was nice, but she was clearly overworked at too many tables. Odd since they actually have tons of other support staff busing and handling water. Took about 20 minutes for them to take my drink order and another 20 minutes to actually bring the drinks. Extremely unacceptable at this price.6) The bill was wrong-they double charged the priciest item.7) The music-Blasting 80's rock including Motley Crue and ironically(?) Rick Astley. Is this a dive bar or a high end restaurant?8) The restaurant is expansive and spacious...but the bathrooms use tiny space saver sinks I'd expect in an east village dive bar for some inexplicable reason (there's tons of room both in the bathrooms and a very large and wide area outside of the bathrooms-why use puny sinks that splash water everywhere?!). Both toilet paper dispensers were also out of toilet paper.9) They brought someone else's very nice designer coat to us from the coat check when we were leaving. I guess this is a positive if you're into stealing nice coats?10) Where are the pitchers of delicious non-alcoholic drinks the Beijing locations are known for?! Instead we get two mocktails and a bunch of generic NYC-style cocktails that have no resemblance to the Beijing drink menu. Why not be yourself DaDong?!Overall, I would have been mildly disappointed at a $$ price level. But at the $$$$ price level (we spent about $110 a person with tax+tip with only half the people having one alcoholic drink) it's just laughably bad.",3,0,0,Johnny Z.,"Manhattan, NY",23,26,0
2.0,1/6/2018,"Having been to beijing's dadong for many times while I was there, I am simply pissed how bad the booking experience is here. First of all they canceled our lunch booking without explanation. Secondly after we made a booking and tried to add our parents to our seats (seeing there are vacancy seats from the Open table) the lady on the phone rudely said they can't do anything. Even if we asked if we can try booking two separate two-person tables and see if they can arrange two tables to be close to each other. She sounds grumpy and unhappy towards the end while we remain very polite and patient. They really need to change their attitudes to their customers. Such unbelievable services!I upped one star after the visit. Admittedly when I saw the menu I feel horrendous. A duck is 98, a lot seafood are market price, a sautéed short rib 50...and we know their portion is known for petite in Beijing. I have no clue how the management set the pricing strategy. Not a problem now given fine dining Chinese food is so underserved but the logistics management is definitely not helping. We spent almost 400 for 4 but ordered a variety of food. My one additional star goes to the cherry foie gras, I don't rmb I have it in beijing but it's creative and fun. Duck is controversial but I don't dislike it, the whole duck portion is sufficient for two couples. Everything else other than this two kinda fell apart, all a bit more greasy. I don't rmb it's so unhealthy. The dessert is uninspiring very small for its price. They have to increase the portion to make people feel its worth. The marginal cost on the food prep is so negligible so please don't be so stingy! the food service we actually have no complain with at all - a big contrast to the booking process.

5.0,1/6/2018,"I was born and raised in Beijing and I ate a lot of roast duck growing up. Unlike many other Chinese reviewing Dadong, I left China before Dadong became popular in Beijing, hence I was able to evaluate this restaurant without comparing it to its Beijing counterpart. There are complaints that the duck is lukewarm or mushy. I didn't find it mushy. And, as far as I recall, I never had a super hot duck when I was in China. Slicing the duck takes time, and the chefs at Dadong - they might not be the best duck slicers - surely took an effort to make sure the duck slices looked pretty. The duck is a bit leaner than you'd typically find in China. As someone concerned about his cholesterol levels, this is a plus. The other dishes are very enjoyable too. I'd definitely recommend the cherry foie gras and pork & shrimp buns. I wasn't a fan of the squid ink soup and our server voluntarily took it off our bill, which is a nice gesture becoming of Dadong's league. While many also complained the tables were too small, I found a plus side to it too: I ordered 4 dishes plus the duck and ended up taking some food home. Because the table was small, our server suggested that we pack the duck before more dishes arrived. If we had a bigger table with everything on it, I imagine I'd have kept eating the duck even after I was full - not good for your health!Finally, the service is on par with other Michelin star restaurants, which others have mentioned. I've read reviews that said Dadong didn't have bags handy for take-home. That's not true for me: they did offer a bag of suitable size for my take-home.

I ordered the first drink on the drink menu. Delicious. Not sweet not too tart. And not strong. The bad.Their standard cucumbers and scallion condiments should be more plentiful. Like each patron should have their own plate of cucumbers.  Their duck wrappers are so dry and stiff. Also does not stay warm. They give one person one round hollow fluffy crunch bun that is pretty good. The sesame is on the top but if you want more it's $5 for another round. $5!!! Is like air and crumbs. Literally $.2 to make. Considering their duck wrapping sucks they should give the option for the crispy pastry. Their service is friendly but rather uncouth. Their reservation line does not return phone calls at all or pick up the phone. I get it it's ""busy"". We walked in on a weds night and were seated right away.

2.0,1/4/2018,"I was so excited about DaDong that I made two reservations the first day they opened up reservations, and I'm sad to report that after the first visit, I've cancelled my second reservation.On the good side, the food was pretty good on average, the duck was served traditionally the way I like (albeit a bit dry), and the plating/presentation was beautiful.On the bad side, let's start with...where was the rest of the food?  Beautiful presentation is nice, but it's a bit obvious that the portion sizes are extremely small when the food takes up less than half the plate...as if they're trying to remind you of how you're overpaying for teeny tiny portions.  Just look at the pictures.As for the duck, it was not carved tableside, and it seems the chefs have set carving spots along the walls so they don't block foot traffic.  Okay, fine.  Nicely plated, but it was the slowest carving ever, and worst of all, there was a bunch of meat left on the bone and we watched them cart the duck back.  At $98 for a duck, I expect the whole duck, not just the skin/outside pieces attached to skin.  Traditionally 1 duck is served across multiple courses (e.g., soup, another dish for the meatier pieces), and if DaDong NY isn't going to offer multiple preparations, at least do a better job of carving the meat off the bone and serving it all with the pancakes.Finally, the service was a disaster.  Our head waiter was super nice and attentive, but everyone else did not have their ducks in a row.  They brought out the pancakes over 5 minutes before the duck came, and then one server came and asked why they were there and tried to take them away (maybe he was as confused as we were by a lone basket of pancakes on an otherwise empty table).  Obviously the pancakes got cold, so our head waiter was kind enough to bring us two fresh baskets (if one is the standard serving, it is definitely not enough for a whole duck).  At another point, another server took away a drink that still had a good 1/3 left without even asking if we were done.  Yet another person knocked a jacket onto the floor and turned around to see us getting up to get it, and then proceeded to walk away...not even acknowledging he knocked it over, much less an apology, and forget about picking it up.Sadly disappointed.  Hope they improve and really think hard about what they're charging vs. what customers are getting.  Would love to have a proper Peking duck place in NYC, but at this current state, I'm not sure I would come back.",2,2,0,Yvonne C.,"Manhattan, NY",76,383,987

Its early stages still for Dadong here in NY so they need to get a bit smoother in there service but I will say this may have been the best wine pairing I have ever enjoyed.  (#1 was E by Jose Andres). The menu is voluminous so for the first visit do the tasting and DO the wine pairing.  Everything is visually stunning at Dadong but the wine really put it all together.

3.0,12/30/2017,"Let's keep it simple -- Dadong NYC does not meet my standard of a high-end restaurant. When we spend almost $400 for two people, I expect more than just a pretty 'face'.I am a Chinese and lived in both Beijing and NYC for a long time. I have been to numerous Michelin stars and high-end restaurants in both cities, and was really excited half a year ago when I heard that Chinese Peking Duck was about to make an impression in NYC.Unfortunately the experience at the 2nd floor was at most mediocre, and the whole dinning experience was going downhill from good to disappointing over time: (star level per item in front)*****Decoration&Ambience: Elegant and nicely done. First impression was: I cannot believe their yelp rating is so low.*****Drink menu: Good number of choices including some Chinese wines. I ordered a mid-end Scotch whiskey and the portion was generous compared to other high-end restaurants.**Table: Creative but quite small - I mean, quite impressively small. No wonder why the waiter stopped us from ordering 2 squid ink soups, as the table eventually cannot fit two soups...!!!****Service: Generally good. We recognized the waiter and believe he worked in a different high-end restaurant years ago. ***Food: In general delicate, good looking with reasonable tastes, but nothing really stands out. Cherry foie gras would be my pick for the day. Peking Duck was definitely below my expectation - we ordered a whole duck but it is still at best lukewarm when served to our table. Duck skin was crispy and nicely non-fatty, while the duck meat was too mushy except for the legs. **Restroom: good looking but very unpractical design. The tiny sink makes the water splash everywhere (meaning on your body), as the faucet is using a motion sensor and you cannot reduces the water flow.**Host and coat-check are right in front of the elevators with extremely small space along a narrow hallway, as a result that whole 2nd floor entrance area and coat check in and out are quite chaotic.*No takeout bags! Unbelievable, my wife and I had to carry two plastic to-go boxes, at 15 degree F, into the Whole Food downstairs to get some bags!?Yes this is my first review. Normally my wife wrote it but due to the mixed feelings we had at this place, I decide to sign up a yelp account!",8,0,1,Lansheng F.,"New York, NY",0,1,0
2.0,12/30/2017,"Where to start--maybe with some adjectives? Pretentious. Over-priced. Underwhelming. Disappointing. I think those give you a sense of what to expect from a visit here. I get that this place opened about a month or so ago in an ""overseas expansion"" from the mainland, but there are still some serious issues that haven't been addressed. After booking a reservation a few weeks in advance, the table we got was so closely situated to our neighbors' that I could see the texts as they popped up on their phones laid on the tabletop and our server kept rubbing his hip against my elbow as he desperately tried to maneuver the varied dishes to fit the limited real estate. By contrast, the bar area seemed more open, but that was not what we were there for, so I can't speak to that. Anyway, the limited menu surprised me, but the frustration really settled in upon preliminarily deciding on a few potential choices, only to be nonchalantly informed that they were not available. Seriously? 15 items to select from and only 10 actually viable options on any given day? Ok, after ordering and waiting for some stretch of time, during which I had the good fortune to hear my neighbors' discussion of upcoming vacation plans, the grub came out. As each plate was set on the cluttered table (a server knocked a pair of chopsticks to the floor as he was engaged in this Tetris-esque struggle), the aesthetics of it all seemed very wrong. I mean, the plates were huge (talking about the platter/dish itself), but the actual edible components were dwarfed by the tableware they were served on. For instance, I was shocked at seeing this serving of sea cucumber that was advertised as ""shareable""--it was a single piece and I could have easily put it down myself. Priced at close to reaching the triple digit boundary, you would think the entree would have been more generous, but then you would be wrong and disappointed like I was. I think the last straw was when the signature dish came out. I regarded the roast duck as my Hail Mary, but once I dug into the oily and overdone plate, I knew it was hopeless. The poor excuse for dessert (orange peel flavored ice cream? really?) added further insult to injury. When I got the bill, I was mentally prepared for the damage to my wallet, but more so just relieved that the ordeal was over. I'm not sure what the comparable dining experience is like in China, but its Bryant Park outpost really doesn't do the chain any favors. It seemed to me that the inflated prices and spotty service were all clearly part of a misguided attempt to quickly recover the investment in this new outfit, which must have been significant, but at the end of the day, Dadong strays too far from what it is supposed to focus on--providing a good culinary experience. I can only imagine how long we would have waited for a reservation if they added a few inches between tables instead of cramming everyone in as they do now. And then, would the end result have been the same?",1,0,0,Reagan W.,"Jersey City, NJ",0,4,0

The duck came out cold as the chef cut it for way too long. The waiter had to waited beside the chef and urged him to cut the duck quicker. When we had the duck, it was so cold that the fat underneath the skin was so disgusting. It took the chef 25 minutes to cut the whole duck. That was ridiculous! Find someone from a Cantonese restaurant in Chinatown and I bet him/her can do a much better job than the chefs you have!!The $52 Kobe beef was so small and only for one bite or two at most. The waiter didn't give us knife and folks so I had it by chopsticks which was fine because it was so tiny so it was perfect for chopsticks.The song shu fish was way over cooked as it was nearly impossible for us to cut meat out of it. We ended up with barely touch the fish (because we could not).

Crazy... it was made very well, but still very over priced. It's like paying $30 for a can of coke (can't blame them maybe they have high monthly Overhead) there was no meat what so ever on that lobster tho. It's like I paid for $58 for the peppers and $40 for the lobster? Like wtf-squid ink soup was very good *9 ( -1 because I love my soup hot) -the pecking duck *5 my main course disappointed me a little. It came out warm-cold, and dried. ( wasn't juicy or moist at all) The meat had a bad after taste , but lucky the skin was still made thin and crispy if not it would have been a zero!  Most disappointing thing was the pan cake wrapping. How do you give 5 pcs of wrap when you order a whole duck that had over 15-30 pieces and charge $5 per extra order? That doesn't make any sense and is a big rip off for sure. I can buy a whole bag of 20-40 in the super market. It was just plain rice wrap nothing special. It should have came free with the order or they should have gave more.The other branch in shanghai and bejing is defiantly a lot better. This place needs some improvements for sure. And some common sense. How do you only give 5 pieces of pancake wrap for a whole duck that they already charge you $100 for?? WtfThe potions are very very small. And very over priced! I don't mind paying for good food but at least let me feel good about myself when I spend $16 a bowl of soup when it's same size as a cappuccino cup? Or $100. Lobster?

2.0,12/28/2017,"From a conventional Beijing duck prospective, the duck is great. But! There is always a room for improvement. First we order the sea urchin over rice, and geoduck clams. I few sorry to said that it was a disappointment. A few things to point out. 1. The portion is a joke. For $22 and $18 a piece it was merely a bite size. The sea urchin was merely bigger than the spoon. Geoduck clams had only 4 pieces in it. 2. The sea urchin over rice is a total Japanese dish with strong wasabi taste. Nothing reminds me of Chinese dish. 3. The duck..... well the duck is good, we ordered a whole duck which was carved in front of us. Nice visual effect, but after the show is over the duck is already cold. Warm at its best. The pancake that was supposed to accompany the duck was also cold due to the fact that the carving took a while. Recommendation for the restaurant, is to bring the pancake out when the carving is done, so the pancake could be soft and warm. The services was the only thing that I would give a 5 star for.

Drinks: deep wine menu, with plenty of solid options in the $50-75 range. Cocktails were terrific. I specifically enjoyed the Double Happy, which was essentially a champagne whiskey sour. Delicious. Food - had a lot, and mostly everything was delicious. Few stand outs: --Red chili diced short rib - very tender, perfect level of spiciness, good fat/lean balance.--Duck - still salivating at the crisped skin dipped in sugar. Meat was tender and moist and there a number of different ways you can experiment with eating it which can be entertaining. --Crispy whole fish - I've had a lot of Chinese food and never had a dish presented quite like this. Very interesting texture and balanced flavors. --Sticky rice wrapped with Iberico ham - just try it.Service: I've seen negative reviews about service, but ours was great.

Steamed Dun Huang Flowery Rolls - looked great. But it's really just a great looking mantou. Squid Ink Soup - Also one of my favorites. A rich and savory soup that's like a seafood bisque with strings of crabmeat.Stir-Fried Duck Treasures - Visually one of the coolest dishes.

Crispy Whole Fish - Very enjoyable, and surprisingly large, cooked in the traditional style and something I'd recommend.Baked Whole Sea Bass - Very much enjoyed it. Especially loved the peppercorn. Red Chili Ribeye Steak - The taste was good and visually appealing ... but relatively light in terms of meat. Although in honesty by this time we were pretty full anyway. Multi-flavored White Chocolate Shells - pretty interesting dessert. An odd mix of sweet and savory that works ... for me anyway.

3.0,12/24/2017,"Went there with my Mom who's visiting for the holidays. Couldn't book a table with in less than a month from now so we decided to walk in and leave our name on the waiting list to a nice gentlemen who s challenging doing his job front of an overcrowded coat check and three elevators (the designers of this place had no idea what they were doing). Why is the host on the lower level is not doing anything but sending people upstairs? With in 30min we received a text to tell us table was ready and we ve been sat in a comfortable corner, our server was efficient but really pushy Eastern European man. We ordered a wonton soup, a scallop cappuccino, an avocado noodle and half the Pekin duck as well as champagne and wines by the glass. All the appetizers are very well priced ($12-$18), flavors and temperature were not so great, but look and presentation are quite nice. The tables are way too small for the pecking duck presentation, we had to create some room by finishing our glass, giving up our chopstick rest so they can fit on the table the 4 or 5 small plates from the dish, once again a design issue. What really upset us was that when the check arrived we noticed that they sneaked $5 for extra pancakes. A) they never told us there was an extra charge B) they advertise that their duck are sliced in 96 pieces, and they give you 7 pancakes to share for two people and a small saucer with the special sauce. Clearly the proportion between the duck, the pancakes, the vegetables and the sauce are not good unless you stuff your pancake to the maximum but Da Dong should be a bit more refined than that. Anyway the food is quite ok, clearly adjusting, the server practices are border line sketchy, the venue is problematic but can be perfected (clustered coat check/reception, loud party music, absence of lighting older people can't read the menu).",1,0,0,Valentin V.,"Brooklyn, New York, NY",0,1,0

We have ordered --- Geoduck Clam - Tasted good -$28 for 4 small bites, Half Beijing Duck - lukewarm duck, the breast meat is mushy, leg meat is better, Crispy Whole Fish with Pine Nuts - way over cooked~ can not even taste the fish at all~ it's more like oily hard batter with ketchup! very sad dish for $62, Black Pepper Wagyu - it was cooked medium well as one piece of steak, tastes acceptable, but for $34? And the funny part was, the wait staff gave us chopsticks and spoon for the dish, we had to ask for a knife to cut the steak with! (Really??)I also ordered the Hot Tea for $7 a cup. The tea came in a 3oz cup, and they told us they will be refilling hot water for us. However through out the dinner, no one was adding hot water for us, we had to ask for them twice! All in all, for a $250 dinner with tip, this is no where near our expectation! The Crispy Whole Fish really killed the dinner for me. It is not even edible!

For a restaurant of this caliber and price point, this is not only outrageous but bad business, especially for a newly-opened restaurant trying to develop its brand and loyal customers. The best of New York restaurants would not only have apologized for the delay and certainly would not have had a surcharge, it would have probably provided a complimentary drink or dessert.         As a Michelin starred restaurant in Beijing, DaDong NY opened with high expectations. We recognize that a recently opened restaurant would still be in a period of getting its act together; however, this is all the more reason to overcompensate for customer satisfaction...they did not.        Our experience is all the more unfortunate because most of the food was very good. The geoduck clams, the sweet and sour ribs, the kung pao shrimp, and of course, the Peking duck deserve special mention.       All in all, we are unlikely to return, at least not in the near future.best of luck,          a disappointed​ NY foodie",1,2,0,Mr Foodie ..,"New York, NY",51,3,0

1.0,12/21/2017,"I was extremely disappointed with my experience at DaDong. While the food was okay, the lack of food available from the menu and the poor service made the experience disappointing, especially considering how expensive the meal was.We made the reservation several months before, and secured a late dinner for 9:45 pm. Granted, the time was late, but DaDong seemed to only take reservation for time slots after 9 pm anyways, so I didn't have many option. Upon taking a seat, I was provided with a beautifully illustrated menu. Excited to try the food, my party and I selected several appetizers to try, half a duck, and a zhajiang noodle. It was only when we ordered did we found out that none of the appetizers we wanted was available. We tried to order a few other items, and it turned out they were unavailable either. I understand it was a late dinner, but it does not explain why literally half the appetizers were unavailable, and that we were not told ahead of time. In any case, we did not end up ordering any appetizers because there were so little to choose from.The duck took ~40 minutes to come to our table. The skin was crispy and tasted good, but it was cold. The portion was also quite small, given that it was ~$60. Then the zhajiang noodle arrived; the presentation was great, with the zhajiang sauce on the side. However the noodle did not actually taste like what Chinese zhajiang noodle should be, nor does it taste very good even if its considered an Asian inspired fusion dish. I ordered this because DaDong is originated from Beijing, also the birth place of the Zhanjiang noodle; but it was nothing like the actual dish. Bottom line is, don't get this dish if you are craving for something traditional.Finally, there was the poor service. Perhaps our server was having a bad day, but he definitely left us with an air of impatience and arrogance that was unprofessional. For example, he seemed annoyed when we decided not to order alcoholic drinks, and also was very impatient when he was telling me the dishes I was trying to order were unavailable. He was also impossible to track down, and several times it felt like he deliberately ignored our requests for service. Perhaps it was a subjective thing and other customers did not receive poor service, but it definitely gave me and my party a bad experience. All in all, I would not return to this place. I think this is a poor representation of what the DaDong franchise is, and is overpriced for its worth. In consideration of the food alone,  I think it might be worth a 3 star. But with the combination of the terrible service, the lack of available food items, and the high cost, I cannot give this place a rating higher than a 1 star.",6,0,0,Aiko W.,"Manhattan, NY",0,6,0

The food was delicious and the service was great, I think they are shooting for at least a 2-star Michelin, they just need to streamline their operations better, for example, DaDong serves Chinese food Western style, in which they bring the next dish after you are done with this dish.  But Chinese people are more used to having all the courses brought to them asap, that's probably the confusion on the long waits between courses. However, on the 2nd fl that we dined, the tables were small and the plates were gigantic, so I can see how it's not feasible to have everything on the table. There will be more space in the summer, when the patio can be utilized.I also learned from the waiter that DaDong employs 50 chiefs from China and sources wait staffs locally in NYC, the chiefs don't speak English and the staffs don't speak Chinese, there are translators involved but I can understand the learning curve.

Love the presentation of the crispy fish, and it cooked into perfection. However, the abalone needed to be more tender and light in soy but I love the nice touch of truffle flavor. Spicy beef was good  in flavor and not too overpowering. Lobster was juicy and spicy with great presentation. I usually love foei gras but I did not think it matched to the menu.

They recommended the fire rooster cocktail, which we didn't like and they promptly sent it back with no charge to us. Very soon after ordering our 7 course tasting menu, we noticed the table next to us was getting their third course, a lobster saffron risotto, and overheard them complaining about having sat for almost 3 hours. We began to dread the grind that awaits us (spoiler: our service was much faster). The dishes began arriving. For the most part, I thought they were well executed, with some notable wtf moments:1. Cherry foie gras comes with a raw unpit cherry. This element is extremely awkward2. Too much pepper in the scallop ""capuccino""--basically scallop in seafood broth with foam3. Too much rice with the lobster4. Why are most of the chocolate shells wasabi flavored!?Some highlights in the dishes:The entrees before the duck (wagyu on a bed of chillis and scallions and bass roasted with garlic) were excellentOur duck was also great with crispy skin and tender moist meat. Our meal last only a little over 2 hours from when we arrived at the restaurant, which was a good pace. All in all, though, for the cost, we thought there is a lot of room for improvements.

Denial - This can't be the same place I went to in Beijing.Anger - Wtf, it is!Bargaining - They just need to work out the kinks in their operation, that's all.Depression - Well, there goes $400+, 3+ hours, and all the hopes and dreams of Peking duck glory in NYC. Acceptance - As much as we tried to love it, let's be real here, that sucked.TLDR - impressive space, terrible timing, small portions, cold and inconsistent food.I genuinely looked forward to this opening since the summer when I first caught wind they would open an outpost in NYC. I emailed, Facebook-messaged, and followed them on all of their social media platforms trying to stay up to date and get a reservation asap. So when I got the chance to attend a soft opening I thought I had won the lottery. That elation turned into the 5 stages of grief after our meal last Friday. Honestly, I wish I had never gone. Then I could hold on to my memory of dining at DaDong in Beijing with my family where all my Peking duck dreams came true.The ambiance and décor is unprecedented for a Chinese restaurant in NYC, let's get that right. I was blown away by how spacious, refined, and opulent the restaurant space was. The three levels consists of a ground floor with just a hostess. On the second floor is the main dining area with a large bar and open seating. Then the third floor was the tasting floor with both open seating, semi-open private areas, and a special VIP space towards the back where the kitchen is. We know this because during our visit an iconic Chinese artist showed up and was escorted to that area. Additionally, I believe there were outdoor spaces on both the second and third floors as well which would provide a great space in the spring/summer. The decision was made when we made the reservation to dine on the Chef's Tasting floor (3rd floor). This was a mistake as we would find out later that the tasting was more expensive than had we ordered the same things a la carte. Our tasting menu had a 5-course and 7-course option and were priced $138 vs. $208, respectively. We opted for the 5-course which did not include the Sea Urchin on Rice (course 2 out of 7) and Sauteed Spanish Red Carabinero Prawns (course 4 out of 7). Below is what we had, in order, without drinks. Cherry Foie Gras: Started out strong with this cherry look-alike foie gras dish that was visually impressive and tasty.Toasted bao (Chinese bread) with an assortment of spreads: The spreads included a meat, spicy bean, and truffle. With the exception of the spicy bean, which appeared to come right out of a jar of Lao Gan Ma Chili, the meat and truffle spreads were delicious. The bao, on the other hand, was terrible - it came out cold, stale, and tasted like it had been left out all day, which is probably was. In hindsight, this was the exact moment that things started to fall apart as the next dish would come out an hour later. Squid Ink Soup: After an hour, the soup came out lukewarm. Full stop. As infuriating as this was, it actually tasted great and reminded me of the porcini flan at Bouley (out of this world). But come on... an hour and it was still lukewarm? How dare you.Seared Wagyu Beef or Flash Cured and Slow-Cooked Sole Fillet: We had both and both were disastrous. The portions were noticeably small and again the food came out lukewarm. The sole fillet was forgettable while the wagyu was overcooked and under-seasoned. This definitely left a lot to be desired.   DaDong ""SuBuNi"" Roast Duck: The moment I was waiting for, and the reason why I endured... this was probably the biggest disappointment and ultimately a big let me down. The duck (most important) and pancake (second most important) both fell flat; there was none of the succulent, juicy, and flavorful duck with crispy skin, nor was there the thin, warm, and moist pancake. As was the theme for the night, the food took a while to come out and was served lukewarm. But you just can't do that with your namesake dish. I could not have been more disappointed. This duck was so far removed from the experience I had in Beijing that I wish I had not come. Multi-Flavored White Chocolate Shells: Who cares at this point, you know? Right about now I was feeling a little depressed and also a little hungry, tired, and yearning to leave. To round out the night was a lackluster dessert with no creativity, finesse, or thought put into the dish. It was as if the restaurant gave up by just throwing some chocolates on a plate, powdered it with sugar, and put a dollop of cream on... and so did I.Drinks were decent enough and helped with the wait. Cocktails were modestly priced at around $15 and wines varied by the glass/bottle. Service was also good from as our waiter seemed kind and was apologetic for the wait.Lastly, I hope they get their act together. I want to come back and update this review to a positive one.",21,14,1,Andrew J.,"Manhattan, NY",209,144,401

2.0,12/15/2017,"My wife and I and another couple had dinner at DaDong last night. We all had been to the flagship DaDong in Beijing and were really looking forward to this brand new restaurant in midtown Manhattan. Unfortunately, we were very disappointed by our meal. First, it is very difficult to find the restaurant. We live in Manhattan and know midtown well but the restaurant's vanity address at 3 Bryant Park is extremely hard to find. Google maps gives an incorrect location. It is actually located on the south side of 42nd Street in a small park between Sixth and Seventh Avenues. We were seated in the main dining room on the second floor. The music volume is loud making it difficult to talk.  We informed our server that we were planning to order a whole peking duck and asked what else she would recommend that we order. She responded that we should order either a half order or a full order of the Steamed King Crab as well as some other ""DaDong Signature Dishes"" highlighted on the menu. We then looked at the menu and noticed that Steamed King Crab was marked Market Price. We asked our server how much the crab dish cost and were shocked to find out that a full order costs $595! It is outrageous that she had not mentioned the price. Needless to say, we did not order the crab. There are many other items marked Market Price on the menu so be sure to ask the price before you order. We started with Crystal Vegetable Buns and Pan Seared Pork and Shrimp Buns. They were OK but really nothing special. We then had the Stir Fried Duck Treasures which were delicious and served beautifully on branches of a small tree. The peking duck course (labeled DaDong Roast Duck) came next. About five minutes before the sliced duck arrived, we received our pancakes and some bizarre hollow round rolls. Unfortunately, by the time the duck arrived, the rolls were cold. Sadly, the duck itself was not warm. The taste was fine but we have had better at other restaurants in Manhattan . We then had the Baked Whole Sea Bass which vaguely resembled the photo in the menu (yes, there are photos of all menu items). The dish was loaded with garlic cloves and was nothing special. We ended with the Wagyu Beef Fried Rice which was very tasty. Unfortunately, if there was any Wagyu Beef in the dish, we could not find it without a magnifying glass. All told the meal costs approximately $200 per couple (with two beers for each of us). We did not feel the meal was worth it. If you want great peking duck in Manhattan, you should take a pass on DaDong and go instead to either the Peking Duck House or Decoy.",3,0,0,Joel E.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,1,0

Like previous reviewer said, Da dong emailed to tell us that our lunch reservation is cancelled. In the email, they said they would do their best to accommodate us should we want to make a dinner reservation and left a phone number one can call. I called the phone number at least 50 times before speaking to a human being. And that human being was very rude. She would not give me any availability that is not available on their website. When I asked for the next 5 pm reservation so we will be home in time to put our baby to bed, she said curtly that she will only check three dates and asked me to pick three dates. Of course, the three dates I picked don't have a 5 pm and only have times like 10 pm or 930 pm. When I asked to speak to someone who can be as accommodating as indicated in that not so apologetic cancellation email, I was transferred to an anonymous voice mail.I have been to almost all of the Michelin star restaurant and this is the worst experience I ever had.

If the standard of the restaurant was low, I would give it a 2-star, but, obviously, this restaurant has high standards along with high price tags. The food is just average. The presentation of the food is amazing, but that doesn't matter when the flavor and overall experience of the food in mouth is poor. DaDong's specialty dish is the Peking duck. The duck, which was very small, was very dry, and lacked in flavors. I'm a fan of Peking duck and had some of the best Peking ducks in China and in the States. The duck at DaDong was the worst. Prepare to bring your own sauce for the duck because it's a ""set"" with additional $5. Lastly, small portion. Bleh. Definitely needs improvements.",4,2,0,Paul R.,"Manhattan, NY",107,8,7

We then left a voice message and haven't heard back from them ever since.For a such a high-end restaurant with so much fame. This whole experience of poor customer service is beyond frustrating.

TBH, the food is above average. They really tried to bring fusion into traditional Chinese cuisine. Service wise, not impressive.And they take their rudeness to the next level here in New York. When the news broke that DaDong is opening a new restaurant here, almost all Chinese I know rushed to make a reservation. I'm among them. I made a reservation on day 1, in October. I have planed it with friends to visit first in December for tasting menu and then again in January for dining floor. As the date gets closer, the anticipation builds up. Although I have read seriously concerning critiques on them, regarding their services and food, like how they would have to wait 1 hour between two courses, and how cold they serve the roasted duck (as name suggested, it should be warm!). Disregards all the negative reviews, we still looked forward to our visit. Today, 2 days before our reservation, DaDong called me to cancel my reservation due to a ""private event"" taking place. No apologies, no accommodation or alternatives offered. It costs them nothing to apologize at least. I was upset and asked to be seated on their dining floor. The lady said to call me back in 1 hour. One day has passed by and I got nothing. There's no integrity or credibility in this restaurant.With this, I know this restaurant won't go far here.

2.0,12/13/2017,"I originally sought out this restaurant because I heard about the one in Beijing, so upon hearing that it was going to open in New York, I snagged a reservation as soon as I could -- and that's how we ended up dining here on the second day of DaDong's opening. I'm thrilled that I was able to try the chef's tasting menu with some of our own a la carte additions, but I can't say the experience itself was all that great. The food was phenomenal, and though it isn't part of any of the tasting menus, I have to throw a huge shout out to the abalone fried rice. It was, by far, the star of my night. Unfortunately, that throws some subtle shade at the renowned Peking duck which was delicious but brought out to us a little on the colder/room temperature side...as if it had been cooked a while ago and waiting for us in the kitchen for too much time.That brings me to the part I hate to admit. I did my diligence and read other reviews before I went and saw that everyone loved the food but hated the speed of service. I was reluctant to believe that because it's DaDong, but here I am, admitting that everyone was on point. Dinner service took around 4 hours, which is fine if the number of courses gives way to that, but it did not. It took about an hour for our orders to be taken and a painstaking amount of time before we were served anything. At the end of dinner service, it was so late into the night that we were explicitly told that we couldn't be offered coffee or tea since everyone in the kitchen had gone home. I don't mind long dinners, but without a mint tea to help me process all the food I've eaten, I can't say I was the happiest camper in the empty restaurant.All in all, it opened for the first time in the States and I went on the second day, so there are clearly some kinks to work out. The food was awesome, the fire rooster cocktail they recommend is a must-have, and though it left more to be desired, I'd probably say that you should check DaDong out in about a year when they've figured everything out.",14,1,0,Johanna T.,"New York, NY",451,221,38

I convinced them to add us to the waitlist and we got a table an hour later.Ordered 3 dishes, dumpling, crispy whole fish and duck, plus two glasses of wine.  Dumpling was OK.  The fish, a decent size branzino, was a bit over fried and came out too tough and dry.  Duck was sliced very unevenly, with most of the slices way to thick(see pictures).  Half of a duck should come out to 40-50 slices but I probably can only count fewer than 15 slices with meat and another 10 pieces of skin only.  While DaDong has the good reputation (in China) of serving a leaner, less oily roasted duck, the duck we had was just way too lean and dry, as some other reviewers also pointed out.  Combining lean, dry, thick slices and lukewarm serving temperature, the duck was not enjoyable.  The check came to $180 including tip, reasonable if the food quality is higher.  Clearly the restaurant is not up to the standard of DaDong Beijing.  It would be considered a 3rd class restaurant in Beijing.  I'm still hopeful that it'll improve overtime.",2,1,1,yue l.,"New York, NY",3,12,14

Unlike other reviews who gave really low scores, I think the food is good and okay, something around 4; but the service is not that professional for real, I would only give 2 stars for the service considering the ""not cheap"" price. I think other reviews really exaggerated the fact about both the food quality and services. Some of the reviews were only based on reservation stuff - which I believed as not that fair for a restaurant. The ambiance is good. The third floor is more like a Michelin setting. The second floor is more like a bar: Bar counter in the middle, tables by side. The decorations were nice, delicately designed. We came as party of six. Initially, we were booked at the tasting menu table on 3rd floor, but the servers were very nice to exchange the seats for us to the second floor. To be honest, the second floor is more COST EFFECTIVE as it would be cheaper to have the same dishes as the third floor tasting menu, and a larger portion on second floor as well. And there are more choices too! I prefer the atmosphere at the second floor as well, more chill and comfortable for hanging out with friends. Everyone came here for the roasted ducks of course, which I think they were good, deserving a four star for the duck. Unlike some reviews saying that the duck/the bread were cold, our order was hot and good, not that messy. I really like the sauce DaDong offers. But I do want to complain about sauces and the small dishes they offered, too limited. It's also unbelievable that extra small dishes and sauce needs $5 extra bucks???The other small dishes were okay. Some were very good, but some were so-so. Dishes I liked - five star for them- Baked Whole Sea Bass: actually my fav dish! I'm a fan of Sea bass, and this one was good, pairing with pink peppercorns and roasted garlic. - Braised Abalone with Italian Risotto & Truffle Braised whole AbaloneThey were both delicious! Very nice cooked, showing the Chinese authentic cooking style. Love these two dishes very much. - Wagyu beef fried rice: very nice cooked! Highly recommend. The so-so dishes:- The cherry foie gras...very interesting... there were six cherries, but only four of them contained foie gras, the other two were only cherries lol. Don't understand why. - We ordered chilled spicy chicken Sichuan style but the server mistakenly wrote down braised beef cubes.... which neither was like what we expected.....Overall, I will give 3.5 stars for DaDong. Though the food is around 4 stars, the services were really terrible. I was very disappointed by the services, as the servers were so unprofessional, and the receptionists were a little arrogant. Though some servers really tried their best, I still believe there required more training for them. The price is not cheap at DaDong, so if the services do not match the price, there is definitely a problem. I know that a new restaurant takes time to accommodate and improve on both food and services, hope our Chinese style fine dining to improve soon.",18,6,5,Jessica H.,"New York, NY",114,109,444

1.0,12/9/2017,"They canceled my reservation without providing any further arrangement. If you are unable to provide service in the lunch time, why do you post such time slots in your reservation system? ""Newly-opened restaurant"" is not an excuse for the bad management in DaDong, since they should earned enough experience in China.",4,1,0,Yang Z.,"Manhattan, NY",16,1,1
1.0,12/9/2017,"I want to give 0 star if Yelp offer the option.We spent 6 hours there last night, just for 7 courses tasting.For twice, they served the wrong dishes.We found a plastic thread in the bread. They said they gonna bring a new one---never happened.They didn't clean the prawn gut, a huge shit there!DISGUSTING!!!!!The sole is not fresh. The sauce is too salty.The soup is full of unmelted corn starch.The duck is cold and dry and the wrap is also cold.MOST IMPORTANT!The price for the same dish is different on 2nd floor(a la carte) and 3rd floor(chef's tasting)!!!! The tasting is a complete waste of money!!!!!!!IF YOU ORDER TASTING MENU, IT'S 60 DOLLAR MORE EXPENSIVE THAN YOU ORDER THE SAME THING SEPARATELY ON A LA CARTE MENU!!! I'm speechless now. I'm still hungry after I finished the $208 7 courses.NEVER COMING BACK AGAIN.PLEASE BE PREPARED BEFORE YOU OPEN THE RESTAURANT OK?",33,11,3,Meng X.,"San Mateo, CA",40,1,10
5.0,12/9/2017,"The best dining experience I've had in NYC in years! Gorgeous new space off Bryant Park was inviting and beautiful. The whole dry braised sole is the best whole fish I've experienced. Tender, juicy meat, and a perfectly balanced sauce. My Fire Rooster cocktail was a nice blend of spice and frothy sweet. Duck?!? Just fantastic! Crispy, succulent skin with meat that was juicy but not fatty. Finally! A place like DaDong in NYC :)",1,0,0,Brian R.,"New York, NY",3,11,1
1.0,12/9/2017,"Opening night at Da Dong was a major let down.  I've eaten at his restaurants in Beijing many times and always left feeling very satisfied.  My NYC experience was the total opposite.  Upon arrival for our 5:15pm reservation for the 3rd floor tasting menu area, we were told they weren't ready yet and escorted to the bar on the second floor.  At 6pm, we were finally seated.  Service was beyond slow.  All of the 7 courses in $208 tasting menu were mediocre at best.  2nd rate fois gros shaped to looked like cherries might have been exciting 20 years ago.  The Uni on sticky rice doesn't even approach the level of a mediocre sushi bar. The squid ink truffle soup tasted mostly of truffle oil.  The famous duck that we waited 3 hours to taste was the biggest disappointment though. It wasn't roasted the way they do in Beijing.  In fact, the leg was definitely fried.  The taste of the duck was ok, but only the wrappers were better than what you would find in a typical upscale NYC Chinese Restaurant.  Other courses all tasted like what you could have from other Americanized Chinese restaurants (sweet sauce!) in the city with a slightly better presentation.  We were there for over 5 hours in and out, most of the time spent on waiting for our next course which is normally 1-2 bites.",8,1,0,Vicki Z.,"New York, NY",30,133,66
5.0,12/9/2017,Almost cried when I had the most authentic Zhajiang noodle in NYC. And no mention of the duck. Absolutely the taste of my hometown Beijing. Fancy decorations and great service.

5.0,12/9/2017,"If you want to splurge this authentic upscale Chinese Restaurant is the place to try! Our food was amazing in flavor and beautifully presented. These were a few of my favorites:  sweet and sour pork ribs, Cherry Foie Gras, sticky rice with Iberico ham, the roasted eggplant. The duck was great served with these amazing rice pancakes. I never liked caviar before but gave this a try and it was delicious. My favorite cocktail was The Monkey King. I will definitely come back!",1,0,0,Susan K.,"Pompano Beach, FL",71,8,0
5.0,12/9/2017,"Chinese food in the US has traditionally been characterized as either low-end fast takeout or an ""exotic"" target for overpriced garbage fusion. Finally, we have DaDong in NYC. As a Beijing native, I can say DaDong back in Beijing is one of the best. Based on our experience during the soft opening, they managed to bring a lot of the greatness from Beijing here, which easily justifies a 5-star rating.",4,3,2,Fei H.,"New York, NY",198,2,0
5.0,12/9/2017,"We visited with 5 of our friends during the soft opening and had a great time. Ambience was classic and they have a GIGANTIC bar! we were told the bar seat has offered a full menu (exclude 2-3 dishes) and is on walk-in basis. so if you did not make a reservation, the chic bar seat area is ready for you. The duck is nicely done, best in the city no doubt, living up to the standard and expectation since i enjoyed the same dish in Beijing's Dadong. Definitely recommend ""Caramelize apple""(not sure whats the official name) for dessert, AMAZING, the staff will give you advice on how to enjoy the dish.Overall 5 star experience, will try the tasting floor soon.",2,0,1,Anggie L.,"Hopkinton, MA",0,4,20
5.0,12/9/2017,"We visited DaDong with 3 friends, during the restaurant's soft opening. Since it was 5 of us, we were able to order a variety of dishes and share. The food is exquisite - delicious, glamorously presented and authentic, yet sophisticated. I would definitely recommend the beef tips in chili peppers and of course, their staple, the Peking Duck. All were prepared perfectly, and looked and tasted great. We had a couple of different cocktails - also delicious and with well-balanced flavors. The staff was friendly and attentive, but not overbearing. Lastly, the atmosphere and decor were very classy and sophisticated, matching the food and service. We will definitely visit again when we are back in town, hopefully when it is warmer so we can experience the terrace as well.",1,0,0,Nayden K.,"Pompano Beach, FL",3,9,6

3.0,12/8/2017,"**Review based on pre opening night experience on the chef's tasting floor** The staff were polite and courteous, but they were inexperienced and sent us up and down the elevator twice, confused about the new space. Appetizers (cherry foie gras and sea urchin on rice) were delicious. Unfortunately, it's all downhill from there. The highly anticipated duck was very dry. Zhajiang noodle lacked noodles for the quantity of sauce provided. Dessert arrived as we were just about to walk out the door (a full hour after the previous dish). The whole meal took 3hr 15min - with average wait time of over 30 minutes between courses. The manager was nice to reduce our check. But they need to get their act together going forward.",4,0,0,Lucy Q.,Hong Kong,0,3,1

5.0,12/8/2017,"DaDong, a Michelin restaurant with locations in Beijing, Shanghai and Chengdu, is now here. The opening of DaDong in New York City was one of the most anticipated restaurant openings for 2017. I came with a group of 6 for dinner; a pre-launch reservation to try the chef's tasting menu, and I was absolutely blown away by my experience. The creations by chef Dong Zhenxiang are visually beautiful, savory, and the epitome of Chinese food.ENTRANCE --- The entrance is located in the open promenade space between 41st and 42nd street. The door ""knob"" is a wooden plaque. You enter into an elegant black foyer on the first floor, where you check in and are escorted by elevator to a floor upstairs.LAYOUT --- The second floor is the more casual of the upper floors, and is divided into 3 main sections: (1) Bar Seating, (2) Dining Seating, and (3) Outdoor space. At the bar, you can have a drink and a bite. If you order the world famous peking duck at the bar, it is brought to you ""bar side"" and sliced next to you, so you still manage to have that special experience. If you prefer to have a sit down dinner at a table, there are tables along the back for eating. The third floor is more refined, and the tables are reserved for the tasting menus and the private dining rooms.AMBIANCE --- The restaurant was designed by architect George Wong, and infuses modern and traditional elements into the design. The bar surface is softly lighted and the gold ceiling light fixture also serves as an art installation. It spans the length of the bar and provides a soft golden glow from above. The Dining area on the third floor is brightly lit and rightly so because when it comes to tasting menus, you need the best light for those Instagram photos.FOOD AND DRINKS --- There are two options for the tasting menu: five-course or seven-course. The food for each course was consistent in terms of taste and visual appeal. I will focus on a few signature dishes that, I felt, really showcased the high-end modernist cuisine that you get at DaDong.1) Peking Duck - The most unique experience I've had peking duck to date was to dip the crispy skin in sugar and feel the skin dissolve in my mouth. The meat was wrapped in the thinnest of pancakes, or you would stuff it meat in a sesame puff pastry. It's a win/win/win situation no matter how you choose to eat the peking duck.2) Foie Gras Cherries - the foie gras is disguised as cherries, and plated among real cherries. It was a fun plate to eat, as your brain and eyes are reconciling the experience with your tastebuds.3) Squid Ink Soup and truffle and wispy tofu strands - having the texture of a bisque, this dish was bursting with flavor from the truffle. Plated in a deep, matte black bowl, the wispy tendrils of tofu looked like noodles, and it made me appreciate the technique that went into producing something as simple as a soup.4) Wagyu Beef - served medium rare, the melt-in-your-moth beef paired perfectly with the stronger taste from the vegetable puree. Plated in a perfect circle with flowers, it looked like an art piece. The service by the staff was top-notch. The sommelier had wonderful wine recommendations and the servers were able to explain the nuances of each dish. This pre-launch opportunity to try the chef's tasting menu was such a fun and unique experience that I don't take for granted, especially because we got to meet Mr. Dong himself! (Celebrity chef swoon). I've heard that the reservations for the restaurant are currently near impossible to obtain (and I see a bunch of disgruntled yelp reviewers who are decrying their outrage), so once the reservations are more accessible, I will definitely come back for another dinner with friends and family, or maybe just to grab a drink at the bar.DaDong will be a mainstay in the NYC restaurant scene for years to come.",17,8,10,Teresa L.,"New York, NY",253,403,259
