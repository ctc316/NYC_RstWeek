2.0,4/6/2019,"5 stars for the great Caesar salads! The 2 stars is for the service. Like the other reviews we were seated and then abandoned for 20min. No server, no water, no acknowledgement, we had to go up to the hostess desk and ask if there is a server for our table. After another 5 min or so we got water and the server came over. I don't have her name because she didn't introduce herself with it. Anyways long story short, they brought 2 dinner rolls for a table of 3, got the 3rd roll after asking twice and our dinner was already served. One salad was made incorrect (asked for dressing on side and it came dressed). Never saw the server again. We told the guy who came to fill our water and he was awesome and took care of it for us. I don't know what happened to our server but she never came back and another server maybe took over? He was the one that brought us our check. The restaurant was also not very busy during our dining time. Food great, service needs drastic improvement",0,0,0,Amy M.,"Fair Oaks, CA",0,11,9
5.0,4/2/2019,The sushi was phenomenal! I had the shrimp tempura roll and Brussel sprouts and they were both great. The restaurant is small but cutely decorated.

5.0,3/5/2019,"What can I say other than this restaurant is outstanding!  Their menu is a perfect combination of steak & sushi.  I recommend the Salmon Sushi as an appetizer, the Porter House w/ Mac & Cheese for dinner & the Creme Brûlée for dessert.  Tender is now officially in my top 3 favorite dining locations.  If you are visiting New York, this is a must experience.",0,0,0,Tyler H.,"Newmanstown, PA",0,8,0

4.0,1/5/2019,Went to this restaurant for a birthday celebration for a good friend of mine . Restaurant is located in the Sanctuary Hotel NYC in the middle of the busiest locations in midtown ManhattanRestaurant is themed as sushi and steak however they have other optionsFood that I enjoyed was the chicken Parmesan and the sushi with rock shrimp on itOther people in my group enjoyed the branzino fish and the Atlantic salmon as well as the steak and sushiWe had a very attentive server who came through with waiting for our selections as well as bringing out the birthday treats right on time,0,0,0,Shirley T.,"Long Island, NY",68,113,421
4.0,1/4/2019,"We went to Haven Rooftop the night before for the NYE party, which was a wonderful experience. As we were leaving the guy at the door recommended we try Tender for dinner one night. We arrived for our reservation and were seated right away. It wasn't busy at all, maybe two other tables, but it was later in the night and also a week night. We weren't greeted for about 5 minutes and it took a very long time to receive our drinks. We had asked for a few things to compliment our meals that we never received and all in all the service was very slow and not at all memorable. The food, although the wait was also very long for that, was phenomenal and the size of the chicken parmesan was insanely large. We were very happy with the food and will definitely be back next time we're in the area, but hopefully with quicker and more attentive service.",0,0,0,Kelsey V.,"White Lake charter Township, MI",72,5,0

3.0,9/6/2018,"I give this restaurant 3 stars only because the food is great and so are the workers BUT I get uncomfortable when the general manager scolds at her staff. If he or she did or say something not by restaurant policy then by all means discuss it with them but in private not in front of me, the customer. It was uncomfortable to watch for everyone but her. I work in hospitality myself as a manager and it's very unprofessional to do a scene. Now when I go, and I see she is working I get nervous for the staff especially if she eyeing the one taking my order.

4.0,7/13/2018,"My husband and I, and another couple, enjoyed a late night meal at Tender. The staff was friendly, the atmosphere was romantic and the food was good. I tried tuna tartare for the first time and it was ok. My husbands meatloaf was awesome. I tried my friends sushi and it was really good.  I love the variety of choices they have on their menu. The only bad thing was that there was a fly in my water. The waiter gave me a new one as soon as I asked so it wasn't really a big deal but still something gross I will always remember. Since my husband doesn't like sushi this restaurant is perfect because he can have his meat and potatoes and I can have sushi.

5.0,4/23/2018,"Service as great, but I went after lunch time and there was not many other people. Had the steak sandwich which was really good, not too many onions and the steak was cooked to my liking. The fries were really really good and I could have eaten more of just those. The rock shrimp were very tasty but nothing unique. (Nothing wrong with them but maybe could have been spicier.) They weren't serving sushi yet by the time I went but I don't know that i would have ordered that anyway. My sister had the chicken club which I then wanted when I saw it had a fried egg on it lol. The place was very tidy and I liked the variety of shows they had on the TV, not just all tuned to the same one baseball team.

We came on a Friday evening probably around 8pm for a friend's going away get together. They had reserved off a few standing tables for us near the bar which was nice.

Max was always attentive.  We were running short on time, but decided we'd come back after the show for dessert.  Gelato, cheesecake, and my tiramisu which I refused to share with anyone.  Great food, close to Times Square, didn't break the bank.",0,0,0,Adam S.,"Brook Park, OH",0,3,0
4.0,3/24/2018,"This place was really good. There were a few things that bothered me but it's subjective so I won't dock down for it. It's a bit smaller than I hoped it would be. It looks a lot bigger in pictures, and I was worried about our big group being a disturbance to others, but we were fine. We had a table of 7 and we were promptly seated as soon as we arrived. We had like 4 different servers so it made for a confusing experience. Our menus were messed up because they didn't have enough menus. I believe they shuffled the pages around in some of the booklets and gathered old pages from an old menu to the new booklets so we received a few old menus that had food they didn't serve anymore. One menu had two of the same pages. Idk how a place wouldn't have enough menus on hand.... Once everything got settled, we ordered drinks and our food. The drinks took a long time to come out. I was losing my buzz as I waited in between drinks (lol) don't you hate when that happens ;). The drinks were delicious. I had a Long Island and it was probably the best one I've had. It tasted natural ( no sweet and sour mixer bs etc). The food came out in a reasonable time. First, I ordered the fried avocado fries with ranch which were outstanding. It was light and flavorful. It wasn't heavy like most fried food. Again, one of the best appetizers I've had. My meal was next. I ordered a chicken dish. I don't remember which one but again, it was delicious. It came with a salad and shoestring fries which I am a fan of. The chicken came with a sauce that was to die for. I loved my meal, and everyone I was with seemed to love their meals too. My friend did complain of her sushi dish being too spicy. Other than that, this place is reasonably priced with good portions. I would definitely come here again.Service was good, food was good, ambience was good!",0,0,0,Nicki A.,"Old Town Alexandria, Alexandria, VA",10,127,26
3.0,3/10/2018,The sushi was good but everything else wasn't so great. The Wait staff was friendly just not efficient. They need bigger glasses for water. The waitress didn't come to our table to ask us what we need as much. We Had the tuna and rock shrimp roll. That was so yummy. The Asian chicken salad was not that great. It was very soggy and the dressing really didn't have great flavor. The edamame was very plain and steamed although the menu called for a ginger edamame. The place was nice though. Very dark and queit for a late lunch. The place was ok.,1,0,0,Clara H.,"Bloomfield Hills, MI",39,77,398
5.0,3/9/2018,Very cute spot. We stopped by for a light lunch and drinks. It was super cute and trendy. They had good drinks and appetizers. My favors were the rock shrimp and guacamole!

3.0,2/24/2018,"Prompt service, got a table almost immediately around 8pm on a Valentine's day so I guess we could consider ourselves lucky. Ambiance was nice but tables were too close to each other, so you can hear other people conversations. Food and pricing were okay, my rib eye was on a medium rare side when I asked for medium. I've had better steaks for the same price. The caramelized Brussels sprouts side dish was very good. We also had avocado fries for appetizers, it was a little salty and the sauce wasn't very impressive (it was like the yogurt sauce that goes with you kabab). We had wine but didn't get dessert because we were stuffed. Next time we will try their bar happy hour. Reason we chose this restaurant was because it was walking distance from our hotel and we didn't have to do reservation.",0,0,0,L H.,"Sterling, VA",74,26,12
5.0,2/21/2018,"This restaurant was conveniently located close to the hotel we were staying for the day (Broadway at Times Square). As I searched yelp for places to eat I came across this gem. When I decided on this place there were Yelp deals and I was instantly sold. The place was very nice, clean, and the staff were amazing. We had a server named Petra and she was absolutely amazing. I was there with my 9 year old daughter and the review reflects both views. Service: My daughter and I were both pleased with every part of the service. When attempting to go the next day she asked if I thought Petra would be working again. The manager accepted my Yelp offer no questions asked. Food: We ordered the chicken strips and buffalo chicken wings from the happy hour menu. I thought they were perfectly seasoned and cooked and amazing. My daughter however felt she could only taste the oil they were friend in. We also had the California and Salmon Avocado rolls and they were equally amazing. I have another Yelp deal so I will be back. This place was amazing and not too pricy because of the happy hour menu.",2,0,1,Marthe G.,"Boston, MA",44,51,218

Since we had a 7 pm show, our 5:15 reservation was perfect timing for drinks and dinner. Everyone loved their appetizers:  ceasar salad with fried egg on top, crab cake, and the famous avocado fries.

2.0,12/22/2017,"Went to Tender late one Saturday after a show. It was almost completely empty, and for good reason: this place was horrible. The whole vibe was (almost comically) trying too hard, with illusions of grandeur that are not met by actual investment in the decor. Food is mediocre at best, and it is STUPIDLY overpriced. (Not just because it's in Manhattan/midtown: just stupidly, you-have-to-laugh expensive. $23 for 5 shrimp!!) It feels like the sort of place tourists go to when they want to feel fancy.There are a ton of Yelp discounts and Groupons and other discounts for Tender, so if you're totally set on going here (and I really don't think you should) you should definitely find those in advance. But it would be way more efficient if they just dropped the price of everything on the menu by 30-40%.",2,1,0,Emma D.,"New York, NY",15,68,17
1.0,12/15/2017,"Writing this review not based on food but based on service. I am big on service, especially when you commit to coming to a place with $20+ special rolls and $10 California rolls. We got greeted by the hostess, sat down, about 5 min later we were approached for a drink order. Both my fiance and I order a glass of wine (I got red). The wine came out about 10 minutes later and my glass of wine was disgusting; it was dusty and dirty. I tried to get the attention of our waitress but she was no where to be around and after 15 minutes got fed-up, decided to walk out. I did not pay for my glass of wine and paid for my fiances glass. We ended up going to Langen's down the block, had super quick service, cheaper drinks and the food was amazing.

The restaurant is dark and a little confusing. There were TVs everywhere which I really don't like. This place was playing sports, politics and Telemundo at the same time which is distracting to say the least. It was loud and dark, the service was slow but friendly, the sushi was pretty good.

Said it was definitely the best fish he ever had and he was not lying. That branzino was cooked beautifully and tasted so good.  I completely cleaned my plate. I would highly recommend trying it out.

2.0,9/23/2017,"This is really a three star review, but I deducted an extra star to offset other reviews that I suspect may not be honest or from people who know what food in Manhattan can be. The food (salmon and chicken) at this place is incredibly bland by NYC standards. It's made with fresh ingredients and nothing was bad, but my friend and I both put lots of salt and pepper (which wasn't even freshly ground) on our food. Also, for the prices, I thought the portions were on the small side. I might come back, because there are so few other options for pre-theater dinner, but outside that immediate area, there are much better places.To be fair, we didn't have steak or sushi (other friends had sushi but I don't know what they thought - didn't hear any raves). Maybe those are better, but I chose the restaurant based on reviews suggesting that the other food was also delicious.

The porterhouse steak to share was amazing but BEWARE! We thought it was $47 for the whole thing, thinking, OK, $23.50 each is reasonable. We were WRONG! It was $47 each! Even if you were sharing.

The one roll had avocado on it which was smooth and perfectly ripe.  The spicy tuna was not overly hot at all.  Hardly spicy for me.  The sashimi was good but a bit over priced.  One piece ranges from $5-$8.

The hostess and servers were super beautiful and professional, and the private room was gorgeous with modern library ambiance (the books in the room were all real). I ordered spicy pineapple margarita ($14), Tok-er ($14) which is Japanese whiskey cocktail with ginger, blackberries, lemon juice and black tea syrup, and both were excellent. For appetizer, I shared avocado fries ($13), mac & cheese ($15), and sautéed Brussels sprouts ($12). Unlike the previous reviews, the avocado fries were good, but nothing special to rave about. I've had avocado fries at different restaurants before and had better ones. Same review goes for mac & cheese - I had better ones, especially at Beecher's near Flatiron. The sautéed Brussels sprouts were actually my favorite and it's its sweet sauce was something I never tried in Brussels sprout before. For dinner, I got tender roll ($18) which has all of my favorites - spicy tuna, rock shrimp tempura, pickled jalapeño. It was definitely good but small size. My husband got black angus rib eye ($50) and while it was beautiful to look at with roasted garlic and rosemary, it didn't wow us in terms of taste.

My wife's branzino with sautéed spinach was very good.  Service after issues were brought to managers attention was ok but staff is not trained and  don't understand what is a true dining experience.  Management deducted $20 for cold food but experience was sub optimal.  The restaurant needs to train staff better and especially kitchen staff about how to ensure diners have a good experience. Wait staff also needs training to understand what is a quality dining experience.  That means pre service team meetings, retraining and clear direction from managers in kitchen and front line service personnel.  Great location.

Complimentary basket of warm bread comes with herb butter. Requested olive oil which was good but then we had a little taste of the butter - it was so delicious we just stuck to the butter.Shared the starters: AVOCADO FRIES - diced apple, basil essence, ranch dipBreaded slices of avocado lightly fried - each bite had a subtle crisp and you can taste the avocado... not a fan of the ranch dip. The basil essence worked better with the fries as the basil essence was not too overpowering to the flavor of the avocado KALE SALAD - avocado, carrots, raisins, sunflower seedsWe knew this was going to be the only healthy dish so we made sure we each had some. Good to incorporate dark greens and healthy fats - simple and refreshing!Mains:CHICKEN BLT - fried egg, bacon, tomato, bibb lettuce, aioliGot a side of extra aioli to add on the the grilled chicken sandwich.

Won't mention how many we each had! We didn't even realize that it was 8:10, when Cyse (sp?), the bartender, came over to us and offered another round at the HH price. Chatted with her for awhile, super-friendly, as we found everyone there to be.Initially, we weren't able to get up to the Rooftop bar, Haven, but we tried again on our way out, Gabriel, working the elevator and sleeve mike, made it happen. When we got up there, though, there were several private parties going on, so there was really nowhere to stand except at a hightop without chairs on the 2nd level. Not their fault, they were trying to help because we wanted to see the place. Great view of the TS lights bouncing off the buildings up there, very cool. We didn't stay, but thanked the hostess for trying. Ended up talking to the 2 guys at front desk on the way out as well, again, really friendly.

I sat stupidly looking around in awe at all the splendor and beautiful people who were either patrons or who worked there. I couldnt figure out if I was in the lobby of a hotel or what but the entire place is so beautiful. There was also a bar near the entrance that seemed to have a nice vibe going on in there.  I finally found my friends in the dimly lit romantic dining area and discovered they were already enjoying martinis. Our waiter, walked up to me and admonished me about not having a martini as well. I was in love from there on in! lol  He was so cool and funny I asked him his name and discovered that he was the infamous Tamir! I had read about him from another Yelp review and I informed him that he had glowing reviews on Yelp which made him pleased. He and the staff here are on their A game but he just made our dining experience even more better by not only being helpful and attentive but he was hilarious! I loved his easy going nature.  Now to the food! Delicious! All of it! My friends and i shared some crispy rice thingy dish that I still have no idea what it consisted of but I really liked it. The avocado fries were a nice touch as well although I wish they were more seasoned.  Being a meat lover I of course ordered the $50 prime rib with truffle butter. I tore it up too! I dont play that! My friends admitted defeat but I was victorious and cleaned my plate off with a gleam in my eye.  The mashed potatoes were just sublime. I could have ate a bowl of that too!",1,1,1,Ariel S.,"Brooklyn, NY",51,216,52

1.0,6/18/2016,"This whole place made me feel scammed from the get go. It was not a ""tender"" feeling upon our exit. I made the reservation here because of the options on the menu and the seemingly good deal of the pre theatre prix fixe menu listed on the restaurant's own website.  When we arrived they gave us no prix fixe menu and said the prix fixe menu was not available on Saturday's, only weekdays. It's called a theatre prix fixe menu - why would that only be during the week and not Saturday which is the most popular theatre night? Then they said they could ""accommodate"" us by""allowing"" us to order from the prix fixe menu anyway. But the prix fixe menu they handed us had totally different prices and food options than the one on the site. When I pulled up the menu on my phone they gave a lot of excuses again as to why it was a different menu and said someone may not have updated the website. Are you kidding me? They then tried to come up with another ""accommodation"" plan to ""allow"" us to SHARE the filetmignon prix fixe and some sides. What?!?! They should just honor what is on their own website. If a customer points out an error (your error) you fix it. On top of that, the food came out wrong and the steak knives were so dull none of us could cut our lamb chops and had to use the butter knife. The manager did not approach us (even though he saw the poor waiter trying to fix the situation) until we were half way through the meal. When he asked how the food was two of us shrugged our shoulders and I said ""the food was ok"". He seemed satisfied with that answer and told us to enjoy the rest of our meal. Huh? Were you even listening? If I was running a restaurant and the guests said the experience was ""ok"" I would find out how it could have been better. He couldn't care less. All in all the food was pretty decent but for the price I would expect better service and concern for a customer's satisfaction.

He literally plopped it in some sea weed. I had asked to fill it with cream cheese, or anything. But got nothing.

4.0,3/9/2016,"Dined here for a second date on a Tuesday night, International Woman's Day. The ambiance felt upscale, relaxed, and romantic. Great furnishings that remind you why you are paying so much money for the food. Definitely felt like a place where you would dress up and plan to have a special occasion. Service was good, our waiter did his best to check in on us every 10 minutes, which became annoying at one point because we kept stopping our conversations to assure him that the food was nice. He was doing his job though, so points for that, not his fault that we wanted to be left alone and enjoy our meal and conversation without being interrupted every few minutes.The prices are expensive. We got a shrimp cocktail for $24 and they brought four shrimps and tons of sauce. We both laughed how such a huge metal chalice filled with sauce could've used more than four shrimps considering how much it cost. The waiter brought out the chalice as liquid nitrogen was coming out of it, so I guess they thought that the smoky effect was worth the price.My date ordered a NY strip steak $45, a small yet delicious piece of meat, which came with a satisfyingly big bowl of garlic truffle fries that were top notch crunchy and flavorful. I got branzino $28 that exceeded all my expectations. I cook delicious branzino so I had a high bar for this fish and the dish went beyond that. The fish had a golden, delicious, well spiced garlicky skin and came with green miso sauce on a pile of sweet sauted vegetables that were cooked to perfection, changing my opinion about how delicious greens can be when prepared with finesse and imagination.For dessert, my date got a way overpriced, dry, tiny cube of tiramisu $12, which did not taste anywhere half as good than the tiramisu that I make, which costs me way less. The three scoops of gelatto that I got were amazing--strawberry, amaretto, and banana chocolate chip are highly recommended!Overall, would return to try other dishes and enjoy the ambiance for a special occasion when I will not feel guilty about splurging so much on food, which is overpriced if you do not check out other reviews and see the photos and descriptions of each dish to determine if it's worth it in your opinion.",2,0,0,Kseniya K.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",223,112,526
1.0,3/1/2016,"I bought a livingsocial deal for $97, which included 2 glasses of Prosecco, 2 amuse bouche. 2 entrees, and 2 desserts.  We ordered 2 drinks as well.First off, the host sat us right next to a noisy crowd right next to the bar -- on Valentine's, when most people would want to have a quieter table. We asked to be moved.Then we had to wait forever until the waitress would notice us flagging her down. She never noticed us and I had to flag down someone else to bring us a drinks menu. I'm not sure why she wouldn't anticipate that the next step would be for us to order something to drink. Then our drinks took forever to get to us.  Btw, the couple to our right were so upset because they had waited so long, they decided to leave.Next, we waited forever, and finally the entrees came.  I had to ask our waitress what happened to our amuse bouche.  Instead of taking responsibility for it, she blamed someone else and said they were supposed to have brought it out for us.Next, the rice on the risotto was so hard, that my teeth hurt - this has never happened to me, and I don't have sensitive teeth or gums.  I couldn't flag down the waitress because she was nowhere to be found, so I found a male waiter (or was he the manager?). His response? ""Oh, that's the way we make them. They're supposed to be that way."" No, ""Are you unhappy with the entree? Is there something I can do, do you want me to bring t back to the chef?""So I ended eating about 10% of my entree. The first waitress came by finally about 30 min later, and asked, ""did you receive your amuse bouche?"" I thought to myself ... what is we hadn't? Would she then have brought it to us with our dessert? Why wouldn't she check earlier?Finally, to top it all off, Tender automatically added $54 for gratuity!  Given the poor service, I would've tipped much less. We ended paying over $100 for taxes and tip.So, $200+ for this terrible dinner and stunningly abhorrent service?  Never coming back.",3,0,0,David J.,"Yonkers, NY",5,67,131
3.0,2/3/2016,"2 starts for service, 4 stars for food.The food was good enough to come back here again and give it another shot even though the service was very bad our first visit.Service: Service is terrible. On our first visit, they had forgot my wife's appetizer and by the time they brought it out...almost immediately after, our entrees came. It was not paced out and they definitely lacked attention. We chalked it up to a poor server. BUT the second time we came...the place was empty (early time to catch a show) and service was still poor. It took 3 requests to get water. There were 6 employees there with 3 tables and they were too busy chatting amongst themselves to keep an eye on the tables. Everything took longer than necessary, especially when I had instructed the server at the beginning that we had a show to catch. A woman in all black that seemed to hover/roam around the other employees (was she a manager? IDK) seemed to just stand along the hostess for a while and must have noticed we began to get upset but still did absolutely nothing...Drinks: The cocktails were..all right/average. Wine alright as well. First time they gave my wife the bottom of the bottle of a decent cab but we dont know how long it was sitting and she remarked it tasted like it was over-aired.Food: Their saving grace. The tuna rice crisp and petite filet was delicious. We've ordered on restaurant week menu as well as regular menu in past. Enjoyed the creme brule. We had high hopes for the steak tartare but it was only average. Our second time here we both ordered the petite filet.Although I did enjoy my meal ...the service leaves so much to be desired. The lack of service kills the experience.

To be honest, I didn't really get a good look at the place since my back was towards the center restaurant area. BUT service was AMAZING!!! Everyone who attended our table was the best (esp our waiter). We ordered appetizers but he brought out extra so we all could have a taste of what we ordered. Awesome-ness. Everyone ordered different things but here's what I had. I got the Atlantic salmon. It was delicious! I'm not always too big on ordering salmon since it can be cooked terribly wrong at some places but here, you won't be disappointed. I had a piece of the porter house. Delicious! And it's for sure big enough for 2 to share like it says on the menu. The avocado fries...were disappointing. Everyone on Yelp rave at it so I made it a point to order it, but it didn't reach the hype. The spicy tuna crispy rice was super good though! Get it. The baked crab hand roll was good too but I really enjoyed the spicy tuna crispy rice. Had also the bite of my friends', Truffle Taglitelli...so good! If you're feeling pasta, this dish will hit the spot. But if you're not a creamy sauce fan, then you might want to stay away. And at the end, since it was my friends bday they brought out the HUGE Sunday in that huge martini glass. Not sure how much that was but its def enough for a table of 10. Maybe it tasted delicious because I was a little buzzed at that point but it wasn't a let down. I still ate it even though I was completely full from appetizers and main course.

Probably the best quality sushi I've ever had. Please order it, you won't be disappointed. We also ordered the New York strip because after all we were in New York! I only had a few bites as I'm not a big meat eater, but my counterpart seemed to thoroughly enjoy my portion. We also ordered the asparagus and truffle fries. They were good but not great.

It came in one of those GIANT martini glasses with 4-6 scoops of ice cream, whipped cream, chocolate sauce, cherries all over, bits of other fruit on top, four banana slices and a brownie on the bottom. It was also adorned with gold flecks for flare. We successfully put ourselves in a food coma :)",0,0,0,Paige H.,"New York, NY",17,203,17
4.0,9/1/2015,"I enjoyed my meal at Tender. The food was good and the decor was beautiful! Instead of ordering entrees, my mom and I split a few appetizers.  My favorite dish was the ""Croquette Roll,"" which was just added to the sushi menu.  It was one of the best rolls I've ever had!  The Croquette Roll was made up of tuna, cream cheese and avocado.  The roll was lightly fried and breaded with Panko.  I had never thought of Panko on sushi, but it was phenomenal!We also ordered the ""Tender Roll,"" which is raw tuna and pickled jalapenos topped with Rock Shrimp tempura- I wasn't super impressed with this roll. It was lacking something.  As our side, we ordered the Avocado Fries- I highly recommend these!  The avocado is lightly breaded and fried in tempura.  For dessert, I ordered the chocolate mousse and my mom ordered the Spanish Flan.  Both were so tasty!The restaurant's decorations are gorgeous!  It has a very trendy, metropolitan atmosphere.  There were lots of concrete statues and dim red lighting.  The sushi chef and bar are in the middle of the dining room.  I will certainly be returning the next time I am in NYC!",2,0,1,Jane B.,"Buffalo, NY",273,399,5557

4.0,8/7/2015,"**Restaurant Week Summer 2015 LUNCH review**3.5 stars, rounded up.An ex-colleague and I tried out Tender for RW lunch last week.  This is a really loungey romantic looking place for a casual lunch.  They play a lot of top-40 mellow-y music too (Adele, Christina Perri...)Ruggy was right - those AVOCADO FRIES!  It's like good fat on fat on fat on fat, but they give you a ton of avocado fries in a pile (that eventually fell over when the waiter put down the plate).  Comes with ranch dressing.  But seriously, these are lightly battered and fried and you realize you're eating fried avocado and this is really bad for you because it's like eating two whole avocados + the oil and batter.  //end rant.  TL;DR - get the damn avocado fries, already!  I also had the shrimp cocktail which was surprising, given how big the shrimp are and the fact that they give you 5 big ones.For our entrees, we both got the black cod, which had wonderfully crispy skin on the top and a delicious spicy sauce.  It sat on a bed of spinach, mushrooms, and various peppers (hated the peppers, was too strong of a flavor for the dish) and had miso broth poured around the side.  The fish was cooked well.Desserts were freaking massive.  Like full size HUGE desserts.  Way too much amaretto ice cream and chocolate mousse.  Basically wanted to die of being too full.For the $25 RW price point, this was definitely worth it.  Portions were huge and the food was great.  However, the atmosphere of this place made me feel a little strange, like it should be 11pm and burlesque dancers running around the place or something.",3,4,4,Allene T.,"Manhattan, NY",2170,1311,3573

5.0,7/29/2015,"I adore this restaurant inside the Sanctuary Hotel. The first thing you see when you walk in is a gorgeous, upscale lounge with very cool lighting and beautiful seating. A few steps up to the left and you'll see a large bar that kind of wraps around in a very unobtrusive way, considering its size. The restaurant seating is situated behind the bar and lounge, sleek hardwoods, intimate lighting, and food to die for, with another smaller bar at the back of the restaurant. Hubby and I shared a filet and quite a lot of sushi (best of both worlds) and it was all prepared perfectly. I suggest making early reservations because it fills up fast. Service was excellent, although the filet came out at least 5 minutes or more before anyone else's food, which was very awkward, letting it just sit there until the rest of the food was served. Other than that, everything was pretty much perfect. It's a short walk to Broadway and Time Square, should you be insane enough to trek through that madness.",1,0,0,Jamie G.,"Keller, TX",47,91,19

5.0,7/25/2015,First time at Tender. Upon walking in I must say the atmosphere is great. The level of attention and care is evident the moment you walk in.  Located inside the Sanctuary Hotel I may have never visited had it not been for a random guy in the park that mentioned checking it out (Thank you strange man in the park..lol). The dining experience was great. The level of service provided to my fiancé and myself was first class. Our server Sabrina was simply AWESOME. Sabrina was knowledgeable of the menu and help recommend the perfect wine for us to enjoy with our meal. When asked for things to do after dinner Sabrina was also kind enough to make some recommendations. Taking it one step further she even asked her manager Amber for suggestions at which point Amber came over and spoke with us for a few minutes she's AWESOME as well. The level of service provided is the best we have had in a really long time. The food was fantastic the people terrific and we will definitely return again in the near future.,1,1,1,Gordon L.,"Manhattan, NY",2,9,5
1.0,7/22/2015,"Had dinner at Tenders tonight as part of NYC Restaurant Week. We were pretty excited as we have only just arrived in the city and had spent the day roaming around and building up our appetites. When we arrived we were seated and given the regular menu only, when we requested the restaurant week fixed menu instead our server, Mark, went and retrieved them and then decided that because we were having the fixed menu that we probably couldn't afford wine and removed the wine glasses. Adding in a fun little comment about how ""we probably won't be wanting any wine"". Well, actually, we did want wine and ended up having to flag him down later to request the menus again. The food was ok - nothing to write home about/post photos on Instagram of. Service was so very slow and inconsistent. Meals came out quickly, but then took forever to be cleared. Then came the bill, Mark had overcharged the table next to us, without any real fix, so we were prepared for an issue. Fortunately for us we were undercharged, after a moral debate, we alerted mark to his error and waited again for a correct bill to be issued. By this time we had waited over half an hour after finishing our desserts with the table still cluttered with dirty plates. Mark then brought the correct bill over - now, back home, when you call out the fact that you've been undercharged, generally you get an ""honesty bonus"". Sometimes it's 10% off, other times a glass of wine for free. But not here. Which is fine, we tipped and then waited for the receipt. Mark then had the cheek to come back over and ""explain"" the concept of tipping to us as he deemed the amount we had tipped to be too low. We get the concept of tipping, we also understand that there needs to be a certain level of customer service provided. We both work in customer service and were absolutely appalled at this attempt at ""customer shaming"". If I had thought about it quicker I would have halved the original tip as Mark decided to leave the bill with us so we could make the encouraged change to the tip. Don't even bother going here, the mediocre food is not enough to improve the foul taste the customer service leaves in your mouth.",0,1,0,Jess W.,"Adelaide, Australia",0,1,0

My friend said her sushi wasn't great. As you can see there's a theme here and it's not great.

4.0,7/16/2015,"Tender is a sit down restaurant which features a steak/seafood/sushi menu (interesting combination) and an intimate, clean, and sleek setting. Tender is located in the Sanctuary Hotel, however while there, you'd hardly ever notice hotel patrons. It features a cocktail lounge separated from the dining room. Location/setting gets 5 stars. Don't bring a giant crowd here though, although that applies to most places in NYC.For Tender's food, my review is mainly for the apps, seafood, and sides. Avocado fries app were very tasty; they used a tempura type of thin coating which helped eased the guilt of eating fried and brought out the avocado taste. For entries, the Branzino (Sea bass) and Jumbo Shrimp Risotto were excellent and filling. The Branzino was a big portion, while the Jumbo Shrimp wasn't big, but adequate. The real winner, surprisingly, was the mac & cheese side. The mac & cheese is served using penne and a white cheese sauce, and was very tasty (but unhealthy). 5 stars for food. I would return to check out the steaks; their quality of offering appears to be similar to big steakhouses (Filet, NY Strip, Porterhouse for two).Tender's service was courteous and attentive. They were fast to serve the food. 5 stars.The only knock I give on Tender is on price. Two things bothered me. First, their Sushi prices are outrageous. Second, their drink prices make no sense. The specialty cocktail menu had prices around $11-14, but instead we ordered a martini which ended up costing $17; it doesn't make sense that a similar caliber drink ends up costing that much more.",0,0,0,Joseph A.,"Stamford, CT",0,7,0
4.0,7/13/2015,"Meatpacking District style and reliable food in Midtown, that's Tender. If you happen to work in the area (like me) and wonder where you can eat that's not a food cart or chain restaurant, Tender is one of those places. It's located in the stylish Sanctuary Hotel and has the ambiance of an upscale nightclub, meaning it's modern, sleek and dimly lit. The food is good and consistent. I love their Atlantic Salmon Burger and order it almost every time with a side of their delicious fries to share. For appetizers to share, I usually get a roll or two (like the Sunset roll or their special rolls) depending on the size I'm dining with. The service is always very friendly and just today they gave us all a free crab meat lettuce wrap   appetizer while we waited. It's a little pricey and fancy for your average daily midtown lunch, at $16 and up for entrees and rolls, but when you want to meet friends or clients for a more substantial meal and conversation, Tender fits the bill.",0,0,1,Susan N.,"New York, NY",307,40,0

I think the room would be better used as a venue for happy hour tapas and drinks, not a nice sit-down restaurant. The meal was fine but nothing I would go crazy for. The avocado fries everyone seemed to be talking about were (by nature) extremely fried, which actually ruined the appeal of the dish for me.

We ordered the tuna seared in sesame seed which started off well until we tried the bed of seaweed salad underneath the tuna pieces (we were quite disgusted with it. It did not compare to the seaweed salads we've had before). The next major upset was the steaks. I ordered the rib eye and the Hubby ordered filet mignon. Both of our steaks were over cooked and extremely salty. I couldnt finish mine as it was pretty much just salt and fat. This was a total waste of his last night in NYC.

Anyway, check the review below:Flavor: 9I had the rib eye. This thing was damn near perfect. Despite this being a somewhat small sized boneless cut, I only took a single point, and that was because some of the fat was a bit grizzled and non-edible. I'm trying to reserve the 10-spot for when I eat every scrap.The meat was perfectly cooked inside. If I had to guess, I'd say they are using a sous vide machine, because the ONLY part that was not pink was the immediate edges, which had a wet crisp on them.

5.0,6/1/2015,"Went to Tender this Saturday for my birthday dinner with family and friends and had an amazing experience! Whenever I organize an event I always want to make sure that everything is perfect for my guests - the food, service and overall experience. From the moment I walked into Tender and was welcomed by the hostess, I knew we were going to have a great night. I pay a lot of attention to detail and for me the ambiance in the restaurant sometimes matters just as much as the food. Tender certainly does not disappoint. The lounge area, where you can grab a drink either sitting at the bar, or at one of the couches is great for an after work drink, or while you are waiting for the rest of your dinner party to arrive. The décor is very modern/trendy. Exposed brick walls with blue leather couches in the lounge - I absolutely loved it. The main dinning room has more of a classical steak house motif but with a modern twist, with darker red colors and dimmed lighting. Since we were a party of 15, we were seated in the private dinning room. It was a perfect size room for our party. We were seated at a long table surrounded by walls of encyclopedias and a fire place in the middle of the wall. Because of the long table, the room carried formality appropriate for dinner, yet radiated warmth with the library motif décor. The service was on the same high level as the décor. Our group was attended to at all times, the food came out just at the right pace to give us a chance to enjoy each others company, yet not get too hungry! I have to give a separate shout-out to Mark, who was taking care of our party. Amazing attitude, speed of service and knowledge of all the menu items - thank you for your awesome help! Now on to the food. When you first hear steak AND sushi, it may raise some concerns as typically good restaurants specialize in either one, or the other. Well, don't let those preconceived notions talk you out of dining at Tender. They know how to prepare both and do it exquisitely. I personally had a Pan Seared Branzino served with butternut squash, spinach and english pea puree. The fish was tender with just the right amount of crispy. Butternut squash gave the dish sweetness that balanced out the favors perfectly. Other people at the table ordered a Filet Mignon, which I heard first hand, was mouthwatering. We have also shared tuna tartare, rock shrimp cocktail and of course avocado fries - all exquisite in their own right.   And of course what birthday party goes without cocktails. I ordered Shadow (grey goose, lychee, lemon, white grape) and it was perfect, considering the my favorite drink is Lychee Martini. It is on a sweeter side though. I then moved to Blackberry Bramble (makers mark, blackberry, rosemary honey) Delicious, if you don't mind a taste of bourbon. Other guests tried Cherry Tree (absolut, morello cherry, lime, basil), just as yummy.Oh, and I got surprised by a Tender Banana Split served in a huge martini shaped bowl (strawberry, banana chocolate chip & dark chocolate gelatos, candied walnuts, caramelized bananas, red velvet cupcake, strawberry & chocolate sauce, chocolate brownie, rainbow sprinkles, vanilla whipped cream). Scrumptious dessert, enough for 10!All in all, from décor, to food, to drinks and ambiance, we had an awesome experience!

I didn't eat much but my 5 Star rating for this place is due to the phenomenal service.  Our server for the afternoon was Mark. He was the perfect blend of friendly and hospitable. I ordered the avocado fries which were very nice, but the highlight of my day was the cocktail - SHADOW. Not an exaggeration - The best cocktail I have EVER had. I generally avoid cocktails because they tend to be sweet but the word ""Lychee"" caught my eye. Grey Goose, Lychees, Grapes and Lemon - Lethal combination ! I asked Mark before getting it if it would be sweet. He explained perfectly that it's sweet but with a subtlety to it. He offered to get me one and said I could send it back if it didn't suit my taste buds. He brought the cocktail out and waited for my review on it. He was already confident that I would love it :)The General Manager, Brad and server, Samantha were also wonderful to us. It was my friend's birthday and I requested Samantha to get us a dessert with a candle for the birthday girl.

I looked around and saw that our table was not the only table lacking menus, and noticed that there were many tables sitting with their menus, waiting to place an order.  How do you run out of menus? Why can't management take orders while the servers look for these missing menus? It was clear that either the kitchen was backed up or the servers were having problems. We knew we were in for a long dinner.The service was a disaster as we waiting 10 minutes for menus, another 5 minutes for water, and then constantly had other customer's food delivered to our table while we waited and waited for our order.

3.0,3/24/2015,"This isn't really my scene. Upon walking into the bar area, my first thought was that this place was very... umm... reminiscent of a certain hygiene product. The restaurant is flashy and tries to be classy. Does it succeed? Depends on your perspective, I guess. There is apparently a DJ, and the mix of music played was certainly eclectic. Not in a bad way. But I think you would hear a lot of the same songs at a wedding reception.The service was OK, tending a bit on the slow side. We were there for a long time, and it got a bit warm and stuffy by the end.The food was OK as well. I had the salmon. Now, I'm relatively new to the whole eating fish thing, so I don't have a large sample size to compare to, but I found the dish a bit fishy and a tad over done. Our party tried a few desserts, and they were decent but not particularly memorable.I would probably not come back here on my own. It's a bit too trendy, and the food doesn't really match the cost or the glitz.",2,3,3,Josh V.,"Chicago, IL",173,374,29
2.0,3/11/2015,"New place for me.  Ambiance and feel was good. But that was it. We were seated at a nice corner table and although the restaurant was empty (there were more servers and employees than customers) the service was not good. It was slow and erratic and the meal was a mess.  We ordered the signature appetizer - fried avocado and also the tuna tartar.  For entrees we ordered a steak and a couple of rolls along with spinach.  The comedy of errors continued, with the steak arriving first! AND it was cooked well done when we ordered medium rare.  My sushi rolls arrived and they were not what I ordered - we got someone else's food.....   My rolls arrived, and the steak was returned while the side of spinach also arrived.  We then got the steak and then after that the appetizers arrived.  What a mess....and they were not busy!!!!  The waiter apologized and the manager came over but ultimately they were too busy talking to each other rather than fixing the processes.  What a mess.Not coming back.  The food was below average - the rolls were tiny and the quality was mediocre - the price was over the top expensive. The signature dish was Ok but not something I would ever order again.  We were comped for the appetizers but it was not nearly enough for the mess they created and for the lost customer.  I advised the waiter to calm down and follow a process as opposed to just running around - I am not a trainer but I have to say the training of the staff is dismal.  Never again.",3,2,4,Marios D.,"Manhattan, NY",196,509,822

1.0,2/14/2015,"We choose this restaurant based on decent reviews. First, please be aware that the restaurant does not look like any of the photos on their website. It is so dark inside, one can't see anything. I was greeted by a hostess with an attitude who insinuated that I was not going to be seated in a half empty restaurant until the other individual in my party of two arrived. After some passive aggressive conversation, I was given a table. This hostess spent the balance of the evening admiring herself, her dress and her figure in the mirrors surrounding the restaurant. Apparently, her appearance was of her most concern vs. her customers. The server appeared to be a deer in the headlights. He had no idea how to make his guests comfortable, when to walk away and when we needed attention. The music was so loud, blaring horrible eighties and nineties disco you could not have a conversation. I asked the server to have it turned down. Nothing was done. Then I asked someone who appeared to be a manager who did turn it down and then the next song was as loud or louder than before. Fifteen minutes later I ask the server again to have the music turned down and again, it was for one track and then again was louder than before. I ordered a sushi roll and asked the server how many pieces would be on the plate. I was told 8. I received 6.

Small place - watch out walking through the bar to the restaurant. They have uneven floors without any visual clues and I ended up falling straight on my knees. I had not even had a drink yet! I was fine but an ice pack or a comped drink would have been nice. Stocking are not very good padding from polished stone floors. Our cocktails came after the first two apps came out..  Waitress clearly forgot but said they were on the way. Just admit it! Also took our order haphazardly. So the food was good. We ordered: Spicy tuna roll - goodAvocado fries - meh not really my thing. They tasted like oil soaked non ripe avocado with too much salt. Rock shrimp - good. Big enough to share for 4 ppl.

When we showed up for our reservation, we were greeted by the owner at the front door, who said our table wasn't ready. We had no problem with that and went to the bar for a drink. He came over a few minutes later and said apologized again and seated us. When reading reviews about the restaurant, the avocado fries had raving reviews, and for good reason. They were by far the best and I've ever had. The sushi we had was very good. The owner came by multiple times to check in and make sure things were ok. I told him that it was my girlfriends bday and he said he would take care of her. They brought out a small dessert that was delicious. When he stopped by again, he looked at the dessert and said that it was too small and they could do better.  They brought out a molten lava cake with ice cream. This dessert was fantastic and we would have been content with the first one. They went above and beyond our expectations.  I can't say kind enough words about this place and their owner.

I got the sunset roll which was good but nothing to write home about for $16 also considering the small portion size.

There was plenty of seating indicating they're either low on staff to wait, the kitchen can't handle the table traffic or they wanted to get us for an extra drink or two while cooling our heels at the front bar.  There I found that the Basil Hayden bourbon, which I drink all the time, seemed to be cut with something else a bit cheaper. It never tastes like that. It did not start the evening well. The much vaunted sushi rolls here?  They're very good, but not ranking their high price tag. You almost expect them to be delivered with a white sticker like an automobile.  Our server was excellent and most friendly. Same could not be said about the hostesses who must be aspiring models because they lack the personality of out of work actresses.  Tender, I'm afraid, is more hype than hip,   Pass.",1,0,0,Brian R.,"Boca Raton, FL",1275,1528,5923

The lighting was great, I enjoyed the spotlight over each table. The candle was also a nice touch. I had the avocado fries and sunset roll. Both were very unique, tasty, and had a great presentation. We also had a $50 coupon so we were able to enjoy more of the menu. However, the wait staff was on a slow side. The waitress must have been new, but she was very sweet nonetheless.

I came here with two of my girlfriends and we were so excited to have some of their specialty rolls.However the service was a little bit spotty. It seemed like most of the wait staff were rushing around without much purpose, and our waitress in particular was scatterbrained and slow when it came to giving us our food and working out our check.I really do love the place, but the food and ambiance really were not enough to outweigh the fact that I simply didn't feel well served especially considering the price of the food.

The sushi is actually really good, but you don't get the sushi bar feeling. It is stuffier, more high end (wannabie) 5star chic restaurant. There is actually a dress code, supposedly.

3.0,10/1/2014,"Five stars for the service. And for the avacado fries, which are not heavily breaded and are amazing. They are served with straight up ranch dressing, which was dissappointing. I love ranch, but they should add something to make it their own. Ginger edamame was good. We had four special rolls. All were good, but nothing special. Very little fish, etc. on top and not as big as at other restaurants. Next time I will try the steak or the cod. The drinks are also very good. The space is very nice, really like the back ""library"" room. There is a rooftop bar on top of the hotel, but we didn't get to see it. According to the bouncer, it was at capacity at 5:15 on a Wed and wouldn't even let us go up to see it for future reference. Who has a bouncer at 5:15? I didn't see him let anyone up there (especially all the poor tourists who were actually staying in the hotel) so maybe it was empty? The inside bar was packed, but also great service, with a DJ.

4.0,9/25/2014,"I reviewed Tender Restaurant back in June and I recently went back due to a Yelp promotion. The promo was you spend $37 and get $50 worth of food. A good deal since I liked it the first time around, but had been part of a private event so I wanted to go back and sit in the regular restaurant.I will keep my 4 stars for this review, and here's why. I only had the black cod from the entree menu but it was delectable. The broth was perfect (I was actually fighting a cold and wanted something warm and steamy) and the cod was melt-in-your-mouth moist and delicious. I would definitely go back to eat this again.My main reason for keeping this spot at a 4 star and not upping it to a 5 star is that I really dislike when places decide how much you are required to tip. I get it for larger parties, but I was dining with a friend of mine before seeing a show on Broadway (and their location is PERFECT for pre-theater!). Here, at least when I went, 18% was automatically included in the price of the dinner - so even if you had crappy service (we had perfectly fine service, but it's the principal I'm not thrilled with here) you are required to tip decently. Don't force my hand. That said, Tender is a good dinner/drinks venue. I have never been to their rooftop, but if the entrance lounge is as thumping and packed with relatively pretty people as it was during our random Tuesday evening, I can only think that the roof would be a good time.",8,0,0,Lindsey S.,"Brooklyn, NY",28,158,592

We were running late and had to call in to get a later reservation and they were amazingly nice about it. At Tender there is a rooftop lounge and there's the restaurant. We went to the restaurant. First impressions: staff was friendly, trendy restaurant, chill ambience and vibe. We ordered the avocado and truffle fries. The avocado fries were interesting, but good. For dinner we had the Pink Panther which was amazing and the Sunset. We also had your typical California rolls as well. For dessert our server recommended the molten toffee cupcake with cheesecake frosting and a scoop of ice cream. We also had coffee!Would I go back here? Absolutely. It's good for couples because it has a romantic feel, but also great for groups. I would want to try the rooftop lounge next time. Overall, it was a fantastic experience.

5.0,9/6/2014,"Thank you, thank you, thank you, Yelp for helping me find Tender. It was the highlight of our NYC trip this time, and that says a lot!First, I have to recognize two folks that made our visit spectacular: Taylor and Tamir. Taylor sat us and we had a nice chat with her along the way. Then we watched as she danced around the dining room noticing details like a not-quite-full water glass, a plate that could be cleared, someone not eating much. Seriously, she kept busy the entire time as if she was an owner. Clearly, the management is doing something right here to have the hostess loving her job this much. And clearly, Taylor is an employee you want to keep happy. And Tamir, who served us, was just terrific. Right there when we needed him and not when we didn't. He made terrific recommendations on food and wine. As well as great conversation when we were asking him about the restaurant... and the wonderful Taylor. (He said by the way, she's always like that and everyone loves working with her.)I do need to add that two managers that were there that evening were also walking around the restaurant and working -- including filling water glasses when needed. This is definitely a hands on place.As you can tell, the service blew us away, but that's shouldn't take away from the food, which was as exceptional as everyone says in other reviews. Yep, must have those avocado fries. WOAH! So different and so YUMMY! I had sushi and my husband steak so we could try both kitchens. Neither disappointed. And I also have to say, I appreciated the serving portions. Not too big but definitely big enough. I noted to my husband that it is hard to keep two kitchens at the same level of quality. They do it.The drinks and dessert also got thumbs up. Oh, we really enjoyed seeing so many of the birthday sundaes that were served. We did not have one, but it sure seems like a fun dessert for a celebration!Thanks to Tender for a great evening with special kudos to Taylor and Tamir.We'll be back!",2,1,3,Jana E.,"Boston, MA",242,34,5

5.0,8/16/2014,"We found Tender to be a fabulous love child of a modern male steakhouse and a sexy sushi goddess. Pros:1) Atmosphere2) Creative rolls3) Prime cuts of beef4) Modern interpretation of traditional steakhouse itemsCons:1) Entrance/Hostess stand2) Ginger EdamameWe went to Tender after a show during Fourth of July weekend, and had no wait upon checking in at the hostess stand. However, it was slightly awkward walking through the main entrance, as it felt like we were going to be handed glow sticks and pacifiers prior to partaking in an evening of fist-pumping and Red/Pitbull. However, once seated we found the atmosphere to be refreshingly modern while maintaining a reasonable and appreciated degree of intimacy. We ordered the Ginger Edamame as a starter, and we were disappointed with the general messiness of the dish. It felt sloppy and swimming in a ginger sauce that seemed to lack serious finesse. Next was their interpretation of a Caesar, which we both agreed surpassed expectations. Beautiful, vibrant green lettuce leafs were threaded elegantly through a crouton that resembled a large square nut. The dressing was creamy and had the perfect balance of anchovy without tasting like mayo or licking the floor of a fish cannery. The sushi and roll menu was not as extensive as seen elsewhere, but the end result was a fantastic portrayal of why quality rules over quantity. We elected for the Tender, Salmon Tomato, and Sunset rolls, and all exceeded both visual and palate expectations. The turf (republican) side of the menu features traditional cuts along with some modern American favorites that have been enhanced by way of fusion or deconstructive techniques. Kind of like dropping your Grandmother's 64 Fairlane off at Gas Monkey Garage and then picking it up a week later. Overall, we feel this was a great new venue to find, and expect for it to rightfully more difficult to get into the next time we are craving sushi after a show.",1,0,0,Brett P.,"Dallas, TX",36,46,0

4.0,8/12/2014,"I took a date out for a birthday dinner here, and it was a sensational experience.  I just can't quite bring myself to give it five stars.This place is super cool, and the food really is excellent.  The service is beyond accommodating (they took care of my secret request for a birthday sparkler with a few winks and nod that made me feel super cool), and the atmosphere oozes 'trendy.'I had the spicy tuna crispy rice, a spicy tuna roll, and the rib-eye steak.  Both spicy tuna dishes were fabulous, and I consider myself to be quite a connoisseur of spicy tuna.  Ditto for steak, and my rib-eye was great.My date had the mussels, and said they were delicious, as well.The Shiso Gimlet was delicious and refreshing.So why not five stars?  For some reason, the whole meal lacked that extra 'oomph,' which I had perhaps unfairly come to expect as a result of the enormous amount of hype and acclaim Tender has gotten since it opened this year.  As I said, both spicy tuna dishes were delicious, but I have had better of both elsewhere.  The steak was excellent, but not memorable, and perhaps felt a tad gristly for 43 dollars (even for a rib-eye).With Tender, you're getting a package deal.  You're not just paying for the food--you're paying to be in the atmosphere.  One can immediately see how this place would attract big-name celebrities--and in turn, those who are obsessed with said celebrities.  It's a great experience, but save it for a special occasion when the focus won't solely be on the food.  If a culinary experience is your priority, better meals can be had for ~100 dollars a head in both the steak and sushi realms.",0,0,0,Reggie B.,"New York, NY",0,3,0

5.0,8/3/2014,"I only have good things to say about Tender. EVERYTHING was AMAZING! I went there for my anniversary on Saturday night with a reservation for 8:30. It wasn't very busy when we walked in but after about 30 mins, every table was filled. The decor is elegant, modern and super clean. Our waitress Sabrina was wonderful. She answered all our questions and recommended delicious food. We started off with the yuzu margarita which has a little heat to it since it has some crushed up chilis in it. Since I'm Thai and I'm use to spicy foods, it was mildly spicy. My husband got the pear express which isn't sweet at all but still good. The drinks were strong which is a plus. We ordered the avocado fries (avocado with Panko crumbs and deep fried with a side of ranch dressing). That was AMAZING! We also ordered the tender roll (spicy tuna, rock shrimp tempura and pickled jalapeño) which was also delicious! The pickled jalapeño wasn't spicy but added flavor to the roll. Next were our entrees. Oh my effin god, you HAVE TO get the braised short rib (with purple, green and yellow cauliflower and Yukon mash)! It is so tender and flavorful. The cauliflower wasn't cooked through (still hard and crunchy) so it wasn't my favorite part of the dish. My husband got the 12 oz NY strip with truffle butter which wasn't on the menu but was a promotional item since they just opened. He loved it. There was nothing left over. He also got the garlic spinach as a side which tasted basic. Nothing too special about that. Lastly, we asked Sabrina what she recommended for dessert and she sold us on the toffee cupcake with a cream cheese frosting and topped with vanilla ice cream. My husband was stuffed to the brim but when he tasted that cupcake, he couldn't stop eating. It was warm, moist and not too sweet. I highly recommend that also. But then again, I highly recommend everything we had except the garlic spinach. 18% gratuity was added automatically but we didn't mind since Sabrina was so awesome  so we added a little extra. Even though this place is pricey, it was definitely worth it. Thank you Tender and Sabrina for being so wonderful and compliments to the chef, sushi chef and staff.

I don't know where the head chef came from but I would imagine him to be half-god, half-man. There is no other explanation for the incredible food this person puts together. We started off with the Avocado fries mostly because I read reviews on them. There was no disappointment. There were plenty of them for 2 people to split and be happy with. The little bits of apple and the sauce they come with we're perfect. We ended up getting sushi as well. The sunset roll. I have eaten sushi all over the world. Even lived in Japan for a while. This was without a doubt the best sushi I have ever had. I can't even explain it. Every bite felt like it melted right n my mouth. We didn't think it could get any better to be honest. I ordered the NY Sirloin Strip. $54. Never paid that much money for a steak, but I was curious to see what more deliciousness this chef could muster up. My wife had the Black Cod. I can't even explain how delicious these dinners were. I was in awe. My wife was in awe. We sat there and ate slowly to enjoy every bite. It was completely amazing. I don't usually order dessert. Not a big fan of sweets, but I just couldn't help myself. I ordered the toffee cupcake. Sounded good. Once it came it just looked like a cup cake with ice cream on it. The only way to explain the way this tasted is to somehow say that it felt like my mouth fell in love with it. My god. It was so friggin good. Best way to top off an already epic dinner experience. Everything about this place was amazing. Including the service we received from Danny. I will never come to NYC without visiting.

5.0,6/6/2014,"Avocado fries.If I ended my review right there, I'd almost give you everything you need to know about ordering correctly at Tender. Luckily that's just the beginning of what turned out to be a fabulous dining experience.Before this space was Tender (in the Sanctuary Hotel), it was a pop up restaurant called Pop Art that featured a then 13 year old head chef named Greg Grossman (seriously - way to make me feel like a complete loser, kid). He's now 16 or 17 and has restaurants in Miami and the Hamptons. NBD. You can learn a little more about him here grubstreet.com/2013/10/g…. But I digress, as Tender has a fully matured executive chef running the kitchen and it shows in the creativity and diversity of the menu.From the sushi rolls (the Tender roll is great) to the apps (avocado fries are insane -more on those in a second) to the drinks (the yuzu margarita was a winner), there wasn't anything I didn't completely enjoy. OK, so these avocado fries... they take unripened avocados, cut them into strips, dust them in a tempura batter, deep fry quickly, and what results is a lightly fried, totally ripened finger food fit for a king. Because of the deep fry step the avocado goes from completely hard and unripened to perfectly soft and delicious in moments. There must be some sort of science involved in that process but I don't really care to rehash the periodic table - I just want them in my mouth. Now. It's almost in the heart of Times Square (yuck, I know), but if you're one of the many New Yorkers that work in midtown you should really give it a shot.",17,5,8,Ruggy J.,"Manhattan, NY",4991,2429,5328
