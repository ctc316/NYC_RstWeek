4.0,5/1/2019,"Update - the hamachi bowl is gone, and they're not willing to make it, even though they are serving basically the exact dish on the apps ""yellowtail jalapeño"" with citrus soy and daikon. This dish is basically the perfect hamachi bowl but without rice so the soy is actually now a bit overpowering on the yellowtail.  The yellowtail is still tender and melts in your mouth, but now it's also soaked in soy. I was pretty annoyed they couldn't put it over rice, because they obviously have rice in the kitchen, because my girlfriend got a poke bowl. So disappointing and I was genuinely so sad that this item was gone and my waitress wasn't even willing to ask if they could make it for me. Don't go in hopes of the excellent hamachi bowl described below! Former review:Truly loved dining here. The atmosphere of this place is fairly astonishing when you first walk in too. Very open setting with some mirrors that make it seem like the space is much bigger than it is. I was stuck between so many different things on the menu, and really had a tough time deciding. I went with the hamachi bowl and that was the best choice I could have made. I eat sushi often and at extremely nice places throughout NYC. I consider myself very lucky. This hamachi bowl was the best yellowtail I have ever had. So tender and melted in my mouth and the flavor was so on point. It was served over a nice bed of rice with great soy and wasabi flavoring. Ugh I actually wish I could have that bowl for lunch everyday. Delicious work lunch and all of my co-workers were very pleased with their meals as well, which ranged from grilled cheese to the kale salad with steak.",0,0,0,Jessica G.,"Larchmont, NY",86,155,445

5.0,12/30/2018,"We spent a week in New York over the holidays visiting family, staying at the Park Hyatt and Martinique on 32nd. After reading some of the other reviews, where people called the space ""devoid of personal touches"" and the drinks ""mediocre"", I'm curious if they went to the same place we did. My wife and I entered the space, cozy and candlelit, with mirrors and a tall open window to watch the Manhattan street creatures mozy by and were taken aback by how classy and minimalistic they made this place with perfect lighting and ambiance. It's quite romantic.The waitstaff are personable and beyond friendly, happy to offer recommendations and make personal touches to the service, while not being overbearing.Both times we visited Kingside, we got numerous cocktails and the salt and pepper fries (which are like crack - perfectly crispy and seasoned with a delicious aioli, and unlike one reviewer said, we were served ketchup too). Here's the breakdown:Pomegranate whiskey sour - my wife doesn't like whiskey but she liked this. As a Kentuckian in origin, I appreciated the touch of Maker's on an affordable drink with the perfect blend of sweet and sour - this one packs a hell of a punch so approach with caution.Aviation - reminiscent of a simplified tiki drink, this one packs maraschino sweetness with piney gin flavor for a very ""puts hair on your chest"" feel but with love - it's very balanced.Troublemaker - a taste of the Caribbean, this thing tastes like what you'd assume Miami would if it were a cocktail. Cucumber and soda make this super refreshing.Matcha Much - smooth, thick, and creamy, as another person said, matcha cocktails usually suck, this was like having a Japanese dessert though - I'd save it for after dinner next time.Big in Japan - the only one I repeated both nights because it's THAT GOOD. Smooth Japanese whiskey is complimented by sherry for a whole package that goes down smooth.The Midtown Spritz was probably my least favorite of the bunch as it just felt a bit weak on flavor and liquor but that's fine, because 7 out of like 8 is not a bad record.The Mules were also fantastic, with plenty of boozy goodness and no wells in sight.I can't comment on the dinner or brunch service here but I have a hard time imagining that the people who served us our snacks or cocktails would suddenly fall short just because that plate is a bit bigger. I really like this place and we'll be back on our monthly returns to NYC.",1,0,1,Jamie P.,"Minneapolis, MN",42,105,11
3.0,12/26/2018,"Had a dinner with SO and friends on a Christmas Night in the city. Good thing it was open and not poured with tourists. Wines and beer lists are quite short, but overall decent. Me and SO had Burrata and it was quite bad - too much mushy and didn't come with balsamic and tomatoes, apples instead. Guys were overall with medium rare cooked burgers. Huge con is that the server tried to charge $46 instead of $16 as tips. Hope that was not intentionally but make sure to write it precise.TL;DR: If the rest on the block is closed, it's not the worst option, but we probably won't return to this spot.

1.0,12/16/2018,"No money was spared in creating this vaulted space devoid of any personal touches or sense there might be an owner on premises. Whoever owns Kingside is phoning it in. I had an unmemorable meal when it first opened and tried it again yesterday on the off-chance it was a bad night. Nope. My omelette was swimming in cheese with a burnt piece of bread  and my friends burger was average at best. He had an ice tea and I had a water and it came to $70 with tip. An untrained waiter referred to the sushi as ""cooked"". Lord have mercy. Of course it's so fancy you have to ask for ketchup with your fries.

3.0,12/2/2018,"I love the cozy gold-and-mirror glass interior of Kingside, the long bar right next to the front window for maximum people-watching, the amazing matcha cocktail, and, most of all, its prime location between my subway back home and my office. I also appreciate how the food is a nice medium between the more expensive restaurants (Marea one block over) and the fast-casual plague that's currently eaten up most of midtown. But, on that note, I wish they could do a better job of standardizing the prices with the portions or ingredients. For one thing, a few pieces of a vegetable roll should not be $15 when the most exotic ingredient is a Japanese pickle (which looked more like daikon). The shrimp tempura roll was okay but if you're going to up the price tag for some advertised black truffle, well, it'd be nice if there was a whiff of actual black truffle.The crowning achievement was the butter lettuce salad, consisting of maybe 8 or 9 leaves in total, doused with a teaspoon of dressing. I'll let you guess how much that was.  Saving grace was my matcha much cocktail. I love matcha drinks but I'm always wary of seeing it pop up in drinks, as the flavor can be too intense and bitter and overwhelm everything else. The matcha here was just enough to come out, balanced nicely by honey and lemon. Adding egg whites was also a good call, as it gave the drink a barely perceptible milky texture. Drinks are priced par for the course in midtown but I could have drank two or three. I'd come back but stick only to the drinks. One drink in particular.",12,3,5,Joy G.,"New York, NY",1203,824,173

5.0,9/24/2018,"While staying at the Viceroy over the weekend I stumbled over to their neighboring restaurant Kingside and continued to stumble in daily. I was quickly greeted by the hostesses who was very friendly. I opted to post up at the bar. Kris was the bartender. He was very friendly, made great suggestions on the menu and even some good recommendations on things to do while in NYC. He really stood out to me since everywhere else I went the servers were rude, short and almost annoyed by our presence. As if we were an huge inconvenience to them. I quickly left other places we were having a drink at to head back to Kingside. Kris really made a whole experience out of even a quick happy hour drink.

3.0,7/5/2018,"This cocktail bar is a cool addition to the chill bar scene here in midtown. We went it through a ""secret"" side entrance, that was just hard to find at first.We sat down and were seated at a table that had a clear glass window to the hotel next to it which was kinda awkward at first, but you forget about it.I had two drinks here and some of the appetizers. First I had the Smoky Mule, which is kind of like a Moscow Mule, but worse. It did not have any flavor to it and was mostly ice, which was disappointing. The next one, I decided to go for a favorite, the Spanish Manhattan, but the bartender had never heard of it, so I explained what it was, hoping that it would be easy enough. But when I got it back, it was nothing at all what I have had before. Never trust a bartender who doesn't know how to make a drink. It is a recipe for a disaster. At least the appetizers made up for it. We got hummus and pita, which was surprisingly fresh for hummus. We also had some weird toast with white creamy cheese on it, that was very bland and then the best dish of the night was this platter of fried cauliflower and cheese balls. They just melted in your mouth. I could have a 100 of them, but then also die from diabetes after.

We've never been here before. She sat us down. We got one drink. Finished our one drink. Sat and talked...for awhile. Looked around for someone to get our bill. I walked up to the bar (where there were NO customers) to try and find someone. Didn't see anybody working the bar, until I looked down on the floor behind the bar where the worker lady was sitting on the floor doing something with a book. I asked her if we could get our bill.

Nope, it means one slider for $6. Same goes for the fish tacos. They are $6 - but you only get one fish taco. Don't put plural on your menu if the dish is not actually 2 or more. The hummus was bland. I gave an extra star because the drinks were fine. Our server was terrible and did not know how to be welcoming to our table and we had to flag him down to request anything.

The server failed to assist us with simple inquires i.e water refill, bring ketchup, milk for coffee-all were requested in original order. There was no staff on the floor and the hostesses were useless. They just walked pass by us and ignored signals for additional service. I requested bread for my poached eggs, they brought it after the bill and the server took my plate away without even asking. The only nice thing was one of the staff saw how upset we were and tried to engage. We confronted them how bad the service was and one of the hostesses apologized, ok, then she told us there was no need to disrespect the staff.

When we were unsure of what to eat he said he would be back but we asked him to stay not knowing how long it would be before he would be back. Our main course was the skirt steak was cold and blackened. No so great. The service is really slow and one would expect that if a client complains the manager should at least show up and apologize.

2.0,11/12/2017,"I've been to Kingside for brunch twice now, and I'll say this: the food is spectacular and it's a welcome addition to the brunch desert that is midtown Manhattan. Sadly, it's among the worst service I've experienced in my 15+ years dining in NYC. On my first visit, service was incredibly slow, the staff couldn't figure out how to operate the coffee machine (so we settled for tea), and our appetizer didn't show until we reminded our waiter a good 20 minutes after the entrees arrived. I chalked it up to a bad day. But my second visit a couple weeks later was more of the same: the front desk had lost my reservation (I had the email confirmation, and was still seated); the service was unbearably slow even though the restaurant was mostly empty; I asked the waiter if my entree came with hashbrowns, and he said yes, but when it arrived it came only with a salad (I would've ordered a side of hashbrowns if he'd told me beforehand); my guest had to ask three times to receive her order of orange juice and the cream cheese which had been left off her bagel order. Kingside, please get it together!!! On behalf of all of us in the brunch wasteland of midtown, we need you and are rooting for you!

3.0,11/4/2017,"Eggs with style (the classic breakfast plate dish that they have) is 18 dollars. You get 2 eggs, a little mini salad, and a small amount of home potatoes. I'd value the more accurate  cost for the dish for what you're getting at 8 dollars. But whatever, you're in NYC, so it's fine. BUT. The low review is due to the painfully slow service. It turns out that our ticket was never received by the kitchen? Which explains only one piece of it. Our WAITRESS was slow. And I asked multiple times if we can order and she wasn't ready multiple times. It took so long before we got water. I asked our waitress if our tea is coming and she said ""I don't know"" - it's her job to check. For 18 dollars a plate, this is quite terrible service.Now I was going to do 0 stars if possible, but after my mother complained to the manager, the manager took over most of the waitresses duties, apologizing profusely, figuring out why our food wasn't coming out, and checking up on us (which the waitress didn't do until the end.) Our waitress would swoosh by, look at our table, and walk away. She would not make eye contact with us when we'd try to get her attention. She wasn't attentive to our needs. The manager, on the other hand, is the reason my review is more than I would have given. She seemed genuinely kind and sorry for the issue. She took some money off the bill, and she offered us free beignets at the end. We are all health conscious and wouldn't eat dessert anyway, but we didn't want to refuse the kind gesture. It was definitely good beignets. I cannot give it 5 stars simply because the waitress did not check on our teas knowing she ordered it for us. She said she's not taking our order before doing this that and the other thing, and Messing up so many things that made this experience terrible for the most part. Another example. One person ordered five eggs but he only got 4 because she didn't know how to input an odd number of eggs. She kept saying it's her first day working brunch shift which is why she's knew to some of the functions, but she knew that she did NOT Know how to do it, so the next logical thing is to ask the manager ""hey do you mind showing me how to do five eggs?""

Ashley, our waitress was quick to greet us. She was very pleasant and attentive throughout our meal.The food was delicious! For appetizers we ordered the black garlic hummus and the fried pecorino. Our waitress suggested the duck special for my son. It included several pieces of the duck including the liver. My son ate the entire dish even after I told him how the foie gras was made:-( My wife ordered the aged bolognese and I ordered the linguine with white clams (a dish I've had a million times in many restaurants). All the dishes were ample yet not over abundant portions. No complaints from anyone. Kingside also has a great all you can eat dessert bar. Just go up there and pick whatever you like. They had cookies, cakes, and donuts. They claim to make all desserts on premises, however, the donuts are made in Brooklyn. That's good because the donuts were stale. Everything else was delicious!As for the price, it was approximately $80/person which includes three drinks, the dessert bar, and a 20% tip.

Was very wrinkled. There where plates and glasses all over the bar from previous customers. She seemed tired or hungover or just annoyed with having to be to work that day. I even caught a lil sarcastic catfight between her and another server. Also I got the feeling that she assumes that as 3pm rolls around most people that come in are just wasting time so they can go to the rooftop that opens at 3pm and whats the point. The problem with that assumptions is although it was true for us, we also where actually staying at the hotel and just checked in.

Our server was a young woman who spoke so softly it was hard to hear her even in the late night ambient atmosphere and she made herself a little too scarce for most of our meal, even though the place was mostly empty. The burger had a ciabattini bun and an interesting relish accompanying it but it couldn't stand up to a classic burger done right. Tartare was tangy and delicious, snails savory and worth trying.

2.0,3/21/2016,"The association with such a chic hotel along with the promise of a menu designed by a celebrity chef made my dining experience at Kingside even more disappointing. In brief, the service was sporadic slash odd and the food was amateurish at best. With proximity to stellar NY restaurants like Quality Meats and Il Gattopardo one would think that Marc Murphy would up the ante at this uptown venue but based on tonight's meal he basically folded. The Ceasar salad with anchovy panini was a promising start but the subsequent entrees quickly let the wind out of my sails. My roasted chicken over polenta was cooked well but unremarkable in both seasoning and size. But it was my dining companion's butternut squash ""agnolotti"" that were the true low point of the meal. Even in the the worst Italian restaurants I've ever been to, I have never been served such poorly executed pasta. The dough surrounding the filling was so incredibly thick that at its center it was completely raw and the overall shape and size of the agnolotti were nothing like the small rings they purported themselves to be. When the server placed what appeared to be a plate of gyoza in front of my friend we were both taken aback. Had we walked in to Joe's Shanghai by mistake? But alas, that was not the case because that would have actually been delicious and this, my fellow diners, was most certainly not. I won't even bother with the brussel sprouts or the caramel pudding as they're not worth mentioning. Despite ordering no alcohol we still managed to spend a considerable amount on a mediocre meal.  Cuisine aside, the overall value for what we received was beyond low and sadly I'm just going to have to chalk this up as a loss and steer clear in the future.",2,2,1,Tre R.,"Jersey City, NJ",33,63,47

Me and my bf shared a burger with the shaved Brussel salad and we got for the table the Percorino toast. I loved the salad!!

We were told by the host that we couldn't sit at the bar because it was reserved for a wedding. The manager kindly made space for us at a large bar table and took our order. We ordered The Brooklyn Nights and The Walking Dead cocktail which were recommended to us and we LOVED them. We ordered a Kingside burger split in two. The fries were a little over salted but the burger was perfect. Although it was hectic with the wedding parties, the bartender still managed to come and check on us.

The jam is savory and served warm. I had the Sweet pea hummus: crudites (carrots, fennel, radishes), pita. The advantage of ordering raw vegetable dishes is that the plates comes out quickly. The hummus is delicious but the dish is listed as a ""small plates"", then it's a small portion of crudites and pita for the price.Shaved zucchini: mint, lemon, pine nuts. The salad was covered with pecorino. The dressing was nicely tangy. I liked the toasted pine nuts.For dessert, the waitress recommended the Salted chocolate butter pie but I ordered the gluten-free King bar: chocolate caramel layers, roasted blackberries. It's a cold candy bar of layers of  soft chocolate and caramel with a base of blackberry chocolate, coated in chocolate. It's very sweet but decadent.The restaurant is located in the Viceroy hotel.

I totally was not expected to have such a bad experience there.In my humble opinion, managers should train their employees before they start serving people, especially in the 5* place. We had to wait almost 10 minutes for a waitress to notice us. We came earlier and the bar was almost empty. She approached us only after I had waived to her. Then she messed up my order. How can you do not know difference between white wine and Prosecco? Seriously?! Even after I double checked if she really brought me Prosecco ( which comes in a small bottle, and not in a carafe), she noted - yes. Well at the end, it took her another another 10 minutes to split our bill using their payment terminal. Two stars are for nice atmosphere, good location and not bad ricotta toast we ordered.

The bar area is a little oddly shaped which is not conducive to standing room during happy hour. I hate that as it's hard to people watch when you're stuck in an odd nook.Cocktails are about $14 a pop but a more complicated beverage will cost more. This area has really built its bar scene up the past few years so there are a few options to go to other than here (but prices will all be the same pretty much).If you're craving a stiff drink I suggest taking a trip upstairs to the top of the Viceroy for The Roof...

5.0,12/24/2014,"We hopped into Kingside after having a terrible experience down the street at an overly pretentious place (the Wayfairer) we dropped into Kingside to see if we could salvage the night.   Luckily - we found a GEM of a place.  The room looks like a big old barber shop with 1920's styled deco tile and lighting, with a funky counter at the back of the main dining area.  A wall of windows in front, a generous sized bar and a counter along the front windows let you sit and people watch while your having a drink.  We opted for a booth int he back dining area, the hostess seated us immediately, and the waiter stopped by to greet us and said he's be right back.   And he was, and set us up with water, explained the menu and we ordered a couple drinks - which came back promptly.  We told him we were just going to relax with drinks, order some apps and we'd figure out the rest.  No problem, and no rush to turn tables.   Nice to know.   We ended up getting a dozen oysters - when asked where they came from he told us Cape Cod, and being from the Boston area - and knowing the oysters on the cape - we asked if he knew where abouts on the cape - our server didn't but the manager stopped by and said - from Dunstable - and he was really informed on the various places on the cape - and began a conversation about Wellfleet, Truro and summering on the cape. The oysters were great, and bright.  We also ordered the Calamari and it was prepared perfectly.  A couple of the local brews matched very nicely with the food. Then - I ordered the Foie Gras - served on a slice of Polenta - it was out of this world delicious.   (Possibly better than the amazing dish at Legal Seafoods on the harbor front in Boston).  The manager and our waiter both stopped by several times and we chatted - they gave me a wonderful porter when the manager explained they poured the wrong beer for me, it too was delicious!  We opted out on desert, as we were headed back to the hotel and picked up some cheesecake from the fresh food establishment next door - but we would have stayed if we had the rest of the evening - overall - you cannot go wrong with Kingside - amazingly attentive staff, wonderfully prepared food and a great vibe.

4.0,10/26/2014,"A restaurant that far outclasses the hotel its attached to, Kingside is amazing place for a no-nonsense business meeting or a lunch spot for an elderly but monied aunt that you don't particularly like. The black and white tiled walls and floors and wooden table tops evoke a Koch administration without any of the grit or strife of that time. It's the safe, affluent New York City of today projected effortlessly in the past.The menu reflects this, with unchallenging but flawlessly executed dishes served up at anachronistically high prices. A smallish bagel with smoked salmon and whitefish salad that went to another table seemed appealing but also pretty insane at $22. And only people on the Norwegian kroner could consider the $13 bowl of oatmeal to be anything but vaguely silly.Speaking about price at a place that this does seem somewhat tawdry. It's not the point at a hotel restaurant in Midtown. What matters is that the details are absolutely spot on - the way the waiter seems unconcerned when our besuited party only orders drinks for the first 45 minutes of the meal. They know that breakfast will come after business. And how even though the party wanders in throughout the morning ,they all are expertly guided to the right table, even without names. The two slices of greens with my egg sandwich are expertly sautéed, not limp in the way this can so easily be.So the Kingside is a winner. It may exist somewhat out of time but it's hard to have a bad time here. I'd hate to think this would be someone's only experience of New York, but it does show the city's impressive ability in creating perfect simulacrums of days gone bye.",3,1,0,Jon S.,"Brooklyn, NY",128,647,1
2.0,10/12/2014,"I understand that certain restaurants are going to cost more because of their locations. But then it's the restaurant's decision whether to ensure a good dining experience so customers feel like they're at least getting some kind of bang for their buck, or to just rip customers off. Kingside has decided on the latter. Not only is everything on the menu overpriced, it's mediocre at best. Service is geared towards selling stuff rather than making customers happy - e.g. If I tell our waiter my escarole is sandy, he can say ""I'm so sorry, I'll let our kitchen know"" or he can ignore the issue and push dessert. I've left very few restaurants regretting I ever sat down, but Kingside's pervasive greed and poor quality really stand out.

Kingside was great about an easy reservation change and accommodating our party of 7 people. The restaurant space is expansive, the bar is small, but well-stocked.  Even with my sometimes crazy family, the wait service was more than competent, even accommodating one person's dietary restrictions (gluten issues) with nary a complaint.  While my husband wasn't overly ""wowed"" by his entrée and I found mine to be small (I had the potato gnocchi with lobster; he had grilled skirt steak), appetizers and desserts had some stand-out dishes.   I strongly recommend the artichokes, grilled octopus and that you save room for the caramel pudding.

My cousin, the birthday gal, ordered an Aviation to start and said it was good, but strong. So, nice for weeknight dining, fine for a group, probably rowdier on the weekends. A nice option for Midtown West.",0,0,0,Cara M.,"Manhattan, NY",19,48,14

1.0,12/18/2013,"I'm not one to write reviews, but I felt the urge to write one about this place given my experience here. We went to this restaurant tonight, chosen by my hip aunt, expecting a great crowd and top notch food. I have to say that neither the food, ambiance, nor service, met our expectations. First, we were seated at the worst table in the restaurant - as we called it, 'Siberia'. We tried to ask for another table with a little bit more ambiance, but were told that nothing else was available by the somewhat sarcastic waiter with an attitude. Besides the service, the food was horrible for an upscale NY restaurant. The kale salad actually tasted like cigarette ash, and the caesar was so overdressed that watery-liquid actually leaked from the greens in your mouth. The brussels sprouts were chopped so thinly, and coated so heavily in parmesan, that the dish just tasted simply of greens topped with parm. That was just the first course... I ordered pasta, a safe bet for any restaurant, so it turned out alright. My aunt had to send back her chicken, which tasted like plain chicken thigh with straight barbecue sauce on the side. My sisters tuna was completely rare on one half, and overcooked on the other - and topped with mushrooms that had been overly soaked in vinegar. There is not much else to say about this experience, except that I will never return, and will not be recommending it to anyone.",2,1,2,Sallie S.,"Murray Hill, Manhattan, NY",0,1,0
3.0,12/18/2013,"Big buzz. High expectations. Nothing transcending but I still had a very positive (after-work) experience at this up-and-coming New American gastronomy embassy in Midtown.From all the fair mixed reviews, I most certainly agree that service was a serious and noticeable flaw at Kingside. The very honorable Tom K and I ordered drinks and saw three different waiters taking our orders, and two maitre d's checking up how we were doing. So much attention was more unproductive than appreciable. We waited a little long for our drinks but food came in timelier manner. Lack of experienced staff?But waiting allowed us to really appreciate the design and to catch the local ambiance. This restaurant smartly combines the essence of American dinners and new gastronomic restaurants. The space is big and this is magnified by the very high ceiling. Crowd, obviously, is afterwork/business/upscale and Viceroy guests will add to the ambient noise. This is no date spot, my friends, and past 6:30 you will feel Midtown's very own buzz. Perhaps you will find more peace seating on the kitchen bar space in the back.Our thirst for liquor was quenched by excellently crafted cocktails. The institutional Manhattan respected its American heritage with a heavy load of Rye and a perfect color, and was the best I had in months (or weeks). Although I usually have it in a Martini glass, this one was served down and the watering brought it more balance. On a more creative tone (but nonetheless loaded), the Cali Swizzle did not take me by deception and was an interesting take on the Dark'n Stormy. Keep the rum, substitute ginger for cinnamon and add some peychaud bitters. Note that the house will charge you $16 for each.In order to fill the holes dug by the formerly prohibited substances, we ventured into small plates. Portions matched the adjectives but the quality was good enough to be highlighted. The Grilled Octopus was served with chorizo and patatas bravas, had a soft texture, was very flavorful and not too oily. In a more original fashion, the Snails were cooked in bone marrow and were not too generous in butter. Overall, good small bites but they are priced like entrees. Count $18 for the Octopus and $17 for the very few snails. Grand total, including taxes, $83 for two drinks and 2 small plates. Kingside has the potential to become one of the trendiest spots in the neighborhood for a while. This restaurant differentiates itself from the rest of Midtown with a trendier cuisine and very well crafted drinks. It cannot, however, mask its operational weaknesses behind big smiles, over polite tone and slim fit clothing for long. The high price tag you are paying for the service will become annoying over time. The Emperor might loose his clothes.",1,4,1,N P.,"New York, NY",108,44,43

After enjoying several rounds of tasty cocktails, I looked at the bill and I was shocked. The champagne and St. Germaine cocktails that I ordered last night for $13 cost me $24 tonight. It was explained to me by the manager that if I ordered champagne that they would pour ""champagne"", not sparkling wine. These are very sophisticated people here at Kingside I think!  I now understand after speaking with the very sohisticated wine snob manager that they are literal regarding the region in which grapes are grown.  I should have ordered a sparkling wine cocktail.  Any idiot should know that.  I then explained to him that if you wanted Vueve, you probably didn't want to mix it with St Germaine and that I thought I was simply ordering Proseco and St Germaine as I did last night. Well, silly me. I wanted to love this place. I'm here every other month staying at the Parker next door. Bummer. I will order water so I don't misstep with these righteous sparkling wine/champagne snobs at Kingside.  Other than that, I was happy to see a face that I recognized from Chopped.

The ""egg in a basket,"" which was essentially an egg in the enter of a thick, almost challah-like toast with tons of shaved truffle on top, was OK at best.

About $200 for 2 apps, an entree, 4 cocktails and a dessert!!!???!!!  I have no problem dropping money on dinner, but the food quality did not warrant those prices. The ""egg in a basket"" was $44! I guess I should have expected a dish with truffle to be pricy, but the waiter did not even think to tell us the price of the special. We felt hoodwinked!

Funny enough, once you're inside, those same lights are unflattering in their brightness. For $80, we had three cocktails and two apps. Although we sat at the bar directly in front of the bartenders, they paid us very little attention. We had to ask multiple times for something (aioli). We ordered artichokes and cauliflower apps, neither of which was prepared well. We asked for aioli to add some flavor to the artichokes, which were undercooked. They then charged us 50 cents for it!
