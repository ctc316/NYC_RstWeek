4.0,1/13/2019,"Came here for dinner with friends for the holidays...been here before and recommended it. Yes, a bit on the pricier side for Italian food.  Great service and food. Décor of the restaurant is nice and the atmosphere.We had the burrata w/ prosciutto appetizert was delicious! one of the best that I have had. complimentary bread was good.Also ordered the salmon with roasted cauliflower - delicious as well. Ravioli di manzo (short ribs) - was okay...needed a little more flavor to it.Didn't get to have dessert this time but there were a couple of options may try another time.",0,0,0,Winny L.,"New York, NY",29,162,1964

3.0,12/21/2018,"The food was very good no complaints in that department. My issue was with the service. I think the only thing the waiter did was take our order. I ordered a bottle of wine it was finished for over 20 minutes and I would've ordered another one if my waiter had actually came around. I didn't even get the chance to order another drink. My boyfriend ordered filet mignon and was never given a steak knife, we were never offered pepper or checked up on at all. It really wasn't a pleasant experience. However I will say the food was good.",0,0,0,Kate L.,"Little Neck, NY",4,18,2
4.0,12/19/2018,"This is a nice upscale Italian restaurant, with an awesome happy hour deal. From 4-7.30pm they have a selection of drinks and small plates available for very reasonable prices. Some of the drinks were better than others; didn't love the tiziano, but the zaffiro was a hit. For happy hour food, we tried the arancini, polpettine meatballs, and the bruschetta. The plates were perfect for sharing and we thought the price was very reasonable. Service was excellent throughout the meal and our bartender made sure we were taken care of!

Food, service, and hospitality are good regardless of whether it's a busy Friday or easy Sunday.  Everything on their diverse menu is well executed, so there is something for everyone.  If you are feeling lazy, they will deliver and time the cooking of the different items so they are ready at the same time.

4.0,11/28/2018,"Ooohh ok so. I really didn't want to love this place because I'm usually not down to eat Italian food outside of my family's kitchen. HOWEVER. Zio Ristorante blew me away. Started with the mussels appetizer (white over red). Asked for it spicy and it came out BEAUTIFUL! Mussels are overcooked 8/10 times elsewhere but they were plump, perfectly cooked and juicy. The spice level was amazing because I truly love super spicy food.Split the Chicken Parm entree with a friend and the waiter offered to split it on two dishes for us. Nice touch! We subbed the side of pasta for a side of broccoli rabe. And again, packed with flavor! Don't overlook this place like I did. It's now a staple in my restaurant recommendations to friends and family.

The gnudi (gnocchi-like dumplings with ricotta instead of potatoes) is heavenly. While the happy-hour serving size is great, it's tough not to get a full order. I have yet to have anything that didn't instantly become a favorite, including the bolognese sauce, the meatballs, and the chicken parm! Their pizzas are delectable, and no combination is impossible- don't be shy to suggest your own toppings, and their staff will whip it up better than you could even imagine!

3.0,10/18/2018,"Everything at this restaurant was just OK. Food was pretty bland and nothing stuck out to me as incredibly delicious. The salmon was over cooked and served over vegetables that seemed to be boiled with no seasoning. Similarly, the risotto lacked flavor and distinction, it needed salt and pepper to taste. Wasn't terrible, but wasn't a great place either especially for the prices.",0,0,0,Anna J.,"Morrisville, NC",213,28,6

It looked interesting, so we went in. We got in and decided that we were not too hungry so we decided to order some appitizers to split between the two of us. The first thing we ordered was the bruchetta.After ordeting this, we couldn't help but to immediately hear our server complaining about how we had ordedered the sunday special of the bruschetta. I really want to say that the food was amazing! However, the way the server complained so loudley that we could hear it in from the front of the resterurant made us feel extremely unwelcome.

We started off with the cured meats and cheese platter which was great but no one told us what the cheeses were or anything. We had to ask. We ordered the octopus entree and a salad. The octopus was alright at best. Almost no flavor but the potatoes were delicious. The salad was a plate full of spinach. Just spinach. With a very greasy dressing. There were maybe two pieces of roasted red pepper. It was terrible. Not sure what was up with the service but we had to wait a good 20 minutes for our check because the waiters were having a meeting (right in front of us) as we kept looking over to ask for the check, we were ignored.

We opted for the set three course lunch menu for $20 and an apérol for $14 each. The size of the plates was small but very reasonable for the price. As for the food itself it was great, especially the main courses we had ( Parmesan with egg and asparagus, and the thick fried pancetta in a bun with salad and fries ) The pana cota was a little small, but for $20 it was just right. The service was also excellent, but as we were the only people there we had all the staff you ourselves. Overall I'd definitely recommend it, it was a pleasant surprise for us going in blind, especially if the food size and quality scales with the pricier individual dishes on the regular menu!

I made a reservation well in and advance and signed up as advertised on the web site for your birthday and get a gift on your visit the week of your birthday. I made the reservation and it asked you can please give us a discerption for your visit and we will try to accommodate. So I asked "" just to sit some where cozy and that the reservation was in my name but I just my on the birthday mailing list my name but my girlfriends day"" as a surprise for her. I called the day of 12/28/17 in the morning to confirm if my request and reservation was secured and could be met. Even thought I had gotten an email confirmation the same day I had made my reservation. When we got there it wasn't busy and that was fairly empty and but and not to many people in the main dinning area. The food was great servers where very nice. Everything could have been over the top and perfect if they get everything correct. Now I gave benefit of the doubt that is was going to have a slice of cake and a gift after dinner after I got my expresso for dessert a surprise for my girlfriend but no nothing after having expressed everything in my reservation and confirmed with the restaurant in the morning of. But nothing so thought maybe at the door as we exit would have gotten the ""sponsored gift"" but nothin and not even a good bye thank you for coming...! This might sound petty but the principle and confirming everything with the restaurant also knowing how much I am spending for 2 people. My explanation where high from this place because everything was going well over the computer, phone, our waiter, and food.

The burrata is always one of my favorite things on any menu - it was really fresh and delicious. For the main course we ordered grilled octopus and the rib eye.

5.0,5/15/2017,"Zio oh Zio, where do I begin? Perhaps I should start by saying I can't recall another restaurant that have provided such exceptional service and went above and beyond everyone's expectations. Zio made my best friend's birthday dinner AHHHMAZING and memorable and I absolutely commend them for the excellent service. From the hostess to the waiters and especially the manager who came by multiple times to ensure everything was going great. I'm a bit jealous I didn't come here for my birthday two weeks ago!On to the food and drinks, majority of us got prosecco upon discovering it was free with a Yelp check in. The prosecco was light and crisp and I enjoyed the bubbly drink. The fried calamari and smoked salmon pizza was good. As for the pizza we expected it to be soft and doughy but it was thin and hard, almost like crackers. But the smoked salmon and cheese was flavorful and complemented very well. For entree, I ordered the galletto as per the manager's recommendation. It's roasted Cornish hen and sauteed spinach in lemon rosemary sauce. The chicken was flavorful and the meat was tender, not dry. The spinach was cooked and seasoned just right. I appreciate that the manager came by to make sure I enjoyed the dish. For desserts, I decided on panna cotta and my best friend got tiramisu. We forgot to let the waiter know to put a candle on the tiramisu but when the cake came out, there was a candle and a cake sparkler. On top of that, we were given a plate of delicious cookies on the house and the manager offered us a glass of champagne which was also on the house. I haven't been to a restaurant where the manager goes to this extent to make someone's birthday special and enjoyable. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone who wants to celebrate birthdays or a special occasion here. They sure know how to make you feel special. Ambiance is romantic, perfect to take a date here. Zio, I will be back...maybe for my birthday next year.",0,0,1,Julie C.,"Brooklyn, NY",198,104,241

One restroom was out of order though, hopefully they get that fixed soon so that there isn't such a long wait.Food is quite good for the most part:- GAMBERI ARRABBIATA: Delicious. The bread was absolutely delicious. Shrimp was well cooked. Sauce was excellent.- IPPOGLOSSO: Not the best halibut I've ever had, and certainly not worth the price. I wouldn't recommend this dish.- FIOR DI LATTE: This pizza was tiny. I mean tiny. And for $17 or so it was completely overpriced. My daughter inhaled this in one bite and then looked over at my food which annoyed me. (I don't share well.)- SEASONAL VEGETABLES: Really good. - COMPLIMENTARY BREAD: Delicious.Zio is really expensive. And I believe their online menu and pricing are not up-to-date.

4.0,3/24/2017,"Cozied between the Flatiron District and Chelsea is your new go-to happy hour or brunch spot: Zio Ristorante.  I spent a chunk of my afternoon here last weekend with some girlfriends and it was time well spent! This restaurant has been here for about a couple years yet remains under the radar.  It's surprising to me since it's in a convenient location and can easily serve as a great first stop before kicking off your weekend or one of those ""stay up late on a school nights"".  When my friends and I were here, we were delighted at how fresh and flavorful each appetizer, main and drink was.  We shared apps like the Al Crudo - a pizza with crust thinner than 432 Park Avenue topped with stracchino cheese and parma prosciutto with arugula as the base - and the burrata and bread basket.  The bread basket was your traditional fluffy bread with crispy crust with crunchy breadsticks but it was the sauce that was the star.  The sauce was sun dried tomatoes with olive oil, garlic and honey.  It was not too sweet but it made it easier to commit carbicide.  This was then followed by the Carbonara and Ippoglosso.  The pasta was the perfect al dente and the sauce wasn't light or heavy, just right.  The Ippoglosso was a pan seared Halibut filet with mixed veggies, oven roasted cherry tomatoes a spinach pesto sauce that was just meant to be eaten with clams.  We also managed to squeeze in some ravioli (homemade braised short ribs filled ravioli, wild mushrooms, pecorino cheese) and meatballs - all available on the happy hour menu as well!  By this point I'm sure you're feeling concerned for your wallet but fear not, frugal spender! For there are options for when you want to treat yo self and save those precious dollar bills.We took a peak at their happy hour to satisfy our curiosity and discovered that they slashed the prices on their appetizers (like the aforementioned ravioli and meatballs) and feature $10 drinks that are typically $14. That's only $4, you say? You're right! So if you want, you can order their $12 bubbly Tiziano drink for $6!  Or beer for $4 or $6 wine/well drinks.  It's really a great HH situation that isn't too common for the area, so I would take advantage.  As for our merry little group, we devoured drinks like the Vodka Roger, Tiziano, Chocococo and this other citrus-y martini situation.  I swear I was transported to the beach drinking that Vodka Roger (grey goose pear with peach puree) but sadly there was still snow outside.Something else that caught my attention was the art on the wall, along with the exposed kitchen and lofty vibes.  The venue has incredibly high ceilings but manages to keep it cozy with their lighting and the warm colors on the wall.  The art - full of colorful collages - suggests you can have fun and eat your cake too.  The staff was also incredibly kind and attentive and seemed willing to ""make it happen"" (my friend asked for an iced coffee and although they didn't have it, they still made it).  Walking to the bathroom towards the back of the venue is a prime event space.  We were told a few events had taken place in their private room but walking through the back area it would be so easy to set up a table for you and 15 of your closest friends.  Not sure I would have any events coming up but, something for any nearby office or social butterfly to consider.  I will definitely come back for happy hour next time I'm in the area and hope there will be more buzz for this more than deserving venue.",2,1,1,Anna F.,"Hell's Kitchen, Manhattan, NY",262,241,2187
4.0,3/22/2017,"It's really 4.5 stars almost on the very cusp of 5. 4.75? Can I just do that? I wish Yelp would allow me to do that. But this is a restaurant that hasn't gained enough attention yet. Everything here tasted fresh as a daisy and delicious. Drinks, apps, shared entrees. Bam. Banging. I went here for brunch (they have a free glass of prosecco for a Yelp check-in special). But they also have a pretty decent sounding happy hour. Marked down appetizers, $4 beer, $6 wines/wells, and $10 martinis that normally cost $14. For appetizers make sure you try either their meatballs or ravioli with braised short rib and wild mushrooms. Best cocktail I tried here? Either the Vodka Roger: Grey Goose Pear, Fresh Peach Puree, and fresh mint. Tasted like a wintry beach escape. Or the Chocococo (I added a few extra cos on the end): Godiva chocolate White, Kahlua, coconut gelato, chambord. Basically desert. Really, most of their drinks were done with high end alcohol and tasted really refreshing.The bread basket. I'm sorry I'm being that Yelper right now. That bread basket. They give you your traditional italian bread sticks, and then your fluffy white crusty italian bread. But the sauce. Everyone should if they don't already know about my deep undying never ending love for SAUCE. Olive oil, with sundried tomatoes, and honey. Its sweet but salty. It's something I'd like at every Italian restaurant's dinner, breakfast, lunch table. I'm a changed person. Thank you.Their pizzas are different than most style of pizzas. It's that type of crust that's almost like a cracker because it was rolled out so thin. Sometimes I like this. Sometimes I hate this. But the toppings more than make up for my discomfort at whether this is pizza or flatbread. Get the Al Crudo - Parma Prosciutto and Stracchino cheese on a bed of arugula and thank me later. As far as pasta goes the Carbonara I split with my friend was really phenomenal. Chewy and good texture of pasta. Would have loved to see a golden runny egg in the center but the sauce tasted fantastic. My other friend ordered a piece of their Halibut fish and it tasted very fresh. All in all its a place I'd see myself coming back to because I can't say anything really negative. Medium-priced but a pretty good deal again during their happy hours that run until 7:30.",4,3,5,Ingrid S.,"Brooklyn, NY",843,1384,11457

It is truly a beautiful space with perfectly dimmed lights, beautiful decor, and an open kitchen as well.  There was four of us and the bar was packed but they offered us a table which was perfect.GET THIS!

5.0,3/13/2017,"I'm hardly ever in Flatiron, but I would travel out of the way to relive a meal at Zio. The scallop appetizers were perfection, I'd come back for just this dish alone. A girlfriend and I split the Polipo and Fettuccine and both were excellent as well. The seared octopus was so tender and sliced like butter, not rubbery at all. Possibly the best octopus I've had in NYC! The kitchen is also so accommodating with my friend's dietary restrictions -- the fettuccine regularly comes with shrimp but because of her allergies, the staff kindly swapped that out for clams. Delicious! It's so rare to find restaurants that offer this kind of thoughtfulness, attentiveness, and flexibility without making you feel like a hassle. As an aside, I love that they have a front area that's a little louder if you want a lively scene, or retreat to the back room for a more romantic, exclusive vibe.

The noodles had a vert strong taste of clam but the clam itself was very sweet. We also got the Fiordelatte pizza which was very unique. The pizza is a shareable size portion for 2 people and the bread is very crispy. Overall, the experience here was very nice and the waiters were very attentive.

3.0,2/23/2017,"The place is very Flatiron-ish, good looking big crowded loud bar with office folk. We were seated in the back with the other couples who were all celebrating Valentines. So far so good....We took a look at the menu and decided on a bottle of wine and an appetizer and two entrees. We chat a bit and then realize that no one has come to take our order, not even for the wine. We call for the waiter at the next table and after a few more minutes our waiter does to tend to us. We put in the order (Shrimp appetizer, Gnudi and the fish entree) and the same thing happens again. We wait and no one brings us any bread, nor does the wine come. So we flag down another waiter and tell him that its been 20 mins since we put in our order. He goes to check and comes back with our appetizer! which is all soggy because the shrimp is served on top of toasted bread. We were hungry by then, mind you we haven't been served our wine or complimentary bread yet, so just ate it; was tasty but would've been better served fresh. Meanwhile we casually ask for the wine again, and this time our waiter says that he actually forgot about it. We were getting impatient by then and wanted to leave as soon as possible, so we asked to cancel the bottle and just get 2 glasses. This came promptly along with our entrees. The Gnudi was a bit salty but the fish turned out to be pretty good.If it weren't a week day and we weren't celebrating anything, I would've been ok with the wait as long as they had served the wine. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone after this experience. To top that, the waiter (maybe he was part manager too) had nothing to say to us, just a half hearted apology with a shrug, saying ""these things happen, what can you do""",2,0,0,Rit U.,"New York, NY",35,29,2

The bomb!! True brunch menu is $35 and you get a mimosa or a Bloody Mary and a three-course meal. It's a great deal and the portions are huge!! From the brunch menu: - We started off by sharing the challah French toast with a side of warm banana slices in a puddle of warm caramel cream, literally, a bowl full of rich butter creamy caramel. Amazing!! There should be an item on the menu with this fabulously rich caramel sauce and a plate of fruits to dip into the sauce. OMG. Get that. - We got the steak and eggs with the truffle fries and the side salad. This dish was delicious and as you expect steak, eggs and fries to taste like! I found the meat perfectly cooked and tender. - Dessert was a massive square of fresh tiramisu, the 3 of us shared it and there was still some left! Very rich and creamy, it was a pure treat! - We sipped on the spicy Bloody Mary. One of the best I've brunched on! The spices were perfect!! I ordered the pounded grilled chicken with sautéed mushrooms, and I substituted the mashed potatoes for grilled seasonal vegetables. This dish was HUGE, and it was so so so tasty!! Healthy, tasty, and beautiful! I ate the rest of it for lunch today! The chicken was topped with a fresh onion salsa that brought the piece of poultry to a whole new level!! Our friend ordered a pizza with pecorino cheese and salami like cured meat. I had a slice and it was great! Would also substitute as an excellent appetizer to share.

It is one of the things that made me want to go inside and eat there in the first place....The hostess was so sweet and provided us with excellent customer service. She escorted us further into the restaurant....We were given seating options so we sat in the longer high seated chairs with that type of table not too far from the bar. The waiter and busboy were so polite and provided great service. They made sure that our questions were answered and tended to our table quickly and efficiently. I ordered pasta with meat sauce which was ok and the person I was with ordered pasta with sausages. It was mentioned that the sausages were delicious! I gave this place 4 put of 5 starts because 1.) my food was ok and 2.)  there was a loud group of inebriated individuals at the bar that were seated not too far from our table.

This was my first Mother's Day and my in-laws wanted to take me out for dinner. We purposely choose this restaurant because it was nice and we thought had a family-friendly environment. As soon as we placed our orders suddenly a live singer came on AND was extremely loud. To the point you could not have a conversation at the table. Our 6 month old (who is a good baby) started crying because it was too loud and hurting her ears. We took her outside to calm her down. As soon as we went back in, she started crying again. I asked the OWNER of the restaurant if he could turn down one of the MEGA speakers and his response was ""maybe a little."" My husband and I ended up having our entrees packed up to go.

Burger and lobster was one of them but it was so packed and over an hour wait. Then their was the tapas place but that was also very full and also had a ridiculous wait time so as a third option I decided to go to Zio. I was immediately seated and was given great service with a friendly smile. I ordered a glass of wine, calamari, and ravioli. We also received bread & breadsticks.  I'm a picky eater not fond of being one but it's true I am very picky and after ready some harsh reviews on Yelp I was hesitant to eat here but Im glad that I did.  The calamari was delicious.  My glass of Pinot Grigio was crisp and cold and nice quality.  Finally my pork mushroom ravioli was the best I've ever had.

The chicken parm was ok can get it elsewhere for a better price and I didn't even get a pasta dish or anything to go with it.

The main reason this is a 2 star place is the service. I cannot remember the last time I went to a restaurant and experienced such bewildering service. I honestly did not know who our waiter was for about the first 10 minutes after placing our drink order & waiting for our wine. Then, a man appeared and asked 'What do you want?' to take our order. No introduction, no small talk, just: what do you want. It was weird. Food was hastily placed on the table when it was ready & then there was a very long wait before we saw our waiter again. He did not offer a dessert menu, but brought one after being asked. I ordered a decaf cap while my mom ordered the semifreddo. By the time my coffee arrived, she had finished her dessert.

3.0,11/20/2015,"I dined here for an educational dinner last night, I had passed this place a few times but never had a chance to try it.I loved the atmosphere and vibe this place gave off; low lighting, soft music playing, warm colors - it was a very cozy and relaxed atmosphere. Service was also prompt - everyone was friendly and attentive throughout the evening. The food sent mixed signals; they started us with a salad of baby spinach, avocado, roasted peppers, and dried cranberries in a red wine vinaigrette. It was tasty but a little overdessed. We were also served eggplant and flatbread margherita pizzas served family style; both were good - the pizzas were thin and crispy which I loved. My main was really basic - chicken breast with roasted vegetables and potatoes. The chicken was juicy but lacked big flavor, the potatoes were puny and overdone, and the veggies weren't impressive either. For dessert they served us a few selections family style: brownie with vanilla ice cream, tiramisu, and panna cotta. If I had to make a guess, these are probably served individually on their regular menu. Throughout all of this, I need to give Zio the benefit of the doubt because I was dining here for an educational meeting versus regular dinner.

For the price point I expected a lot better. The best I can say about the experience was that the salad and the flat bread pizza we ordered for our anitpasto weren't bad.

The hostess was kind and offered to check our jackets and my backpack, which I happily took part of. The server was excellent. One of the people in the group had quite a few food allergies which she explained to the server and not only did he suggest what entrees could be modified to accommodate her, he went above and beyond to let her know what appetizers she should steer away from. He was very nice, attentive, and took great care of us.The food is just OK; while the other folks in the group had pasta dishes, I had the duck which was quite good.

2.0,11/5/2014,"Really unimpressed with Zio. The decor is night and it is really big so you are not crowded but beyond that I do not have much good to say.The server we had was nice enough but not personable at all and had no input on the menu what-so-ever. When we asked for another minute to look at the menu he told us the kitchen needed our order right now (it was 7:15pm).Got a manhattan that had no cherry and did not taste like it had any bitters. Just simply whiskey and vermouth. Not sure what it was about it but it was just not very good. When my friend asked to switch to a different drink bc she didn't like it, the manager brought the drink back, threw it down, gave us attitude about wasting it and was really rude.The food was good, not great. The pasta was cooked well enough but I expected more from a place like this. I got the pappardelle which was alright but I think the gnocchi was the best entreeThe other highlight was the tiramisu, very good.Overall, food was meh, not worth it for the price, the service was lacking and the manager left us with a bad impression.

2.0,6/3/2014,"It's my own fault for even choosing this place to begin with, since I judged the book by its cover while I was passing by this restaurant on my way to Sala 19 for tapas.  Or in this case, by its duplicitous glass exterior.  Don't throw fire at me.I guess if you're perceptive enough you'll pick up on the fact that they'll purposely fill up the exterior dining room to make it look like a full house from the outside but you'll quickly find out the interior dining hall is completely empty, indicating everything you need to know quality and ethics-wise (although I understand the business driving aspect of it, so I can't really hate?).  The reviewer who picked up on this, you have my respect.Crab cakes.  Pappardelle.  Filet mignon.  All looked better than they tasted.  I won't go into full descriptive detail because they were that forgettable.I don't know if it was because we came on an off day, since it was raining that night, but it just didn't do it.  The only thing I looked forward to after this was the exit to the restaurant.",3,4,1,Caroline K.,"Queens, NY",328,444,37

The waiter gave us a laundry list of specials, and we were impressed that he remembered the whole list. It probably took him hours to memorize it.We shared the GRANCHIO - Pan seared mini crab cakes with red pepper coulis, frisee and crispy pancetta. It was a huge disappointment. Yes they were mini, but they were practically burnt. The crust was dark brown, and it did not look appetizing. It was very tough since it was overcooked. For entrees, we shared the PAPPARDELLE - Ribbon pasta with braised lamb ragu, and the FILETTO - Pan roasted filet mignon served with roasted new potatoes, brussel sprouts & lambrusco glaze. I asked the filet mignon be cooked medium rare, and it came out Medium. It wasn't that flavorful or tender as i expected. The pappardelle was pretty good though.

4.0,10/28/2013,"Zio Ristorante serves Italian and Mediterranean cusine in the heart of New York City's Flatiron District. It delivers a lively atmosphere in a warm setting; making it ideal for both intimate and group dining. The restaurant has a few distinct areas; the entry lounge with large bay windows, the main dining room alive with laughter and good conversation, a private dining space in the back, and a bar in between the two. There is also an open kitchen in the main dining area that enhances the spacious interior and adds life to whole experience. We ordered a bottle of Pinot Grigio from their extensive wine list. Unfortunately our server came back informing us that the one we originally chose was not available but offered a similar alternative. He allowed me to taste and rate the wine before agreeing to go with the whole bottle. In addition to vino, our meal started with a delightful breadbasket that included crunchy rosemary bread sticks and a yummy sun dried tomato infused olive oil. This flavorful combo held us over well until our entrees arrived. There were four of us total and each of us ordered one of their fresh homemade pastas as our entrees. One friend ordered the pappardelle with braised lamb ragu, the other the paccheri with bolognese sauce, and the last the cavatelli with manilla clams, pumpkin puree and bottarga. As for myself, I decided on the broccoli rabe filled ravioli with pine nuts, raisins, and salted ricotta. Everyone's dishes looked delicious; beautifully presented and full of fresh ingredients. My ravioli was the perfect portion. They were both light and filling pillows of authentic Italian yumminess.    Service is excellent: high energy and attentive to all our needs, polite and professional while still being friendly. Our server Gio a little difficult to understand when it came to listing off the special with his accent but it was at least manageable as the set menu offered enough delicious choices. Overall Gio was delightful, as was the rest of the staff, from the warm welcome by the hostess to those who wished us well as we left. The only problem we experienced while at Zio, that didn't really have much to do with them, was a big group of guys that decided to all crowd around the bar, which our table was one of the closest to, to do shots. They were really loud and quite literally up against the backs of our seats.

It was still early so there were only a handful of tables occupied in the main dining room but as the night progressed, tables were filled along with two large parties. The service was good as were the drinks. We ordered a number of different apps to start: POLIPO (octopus), MELANZANE (eggplant), TARTARA DI TONNO (tuna tartare), and PIZZA FIOR DI LATTE. All the apps were delicious and a good size for sharing small bites. The pizza was served thin crust and had just the right amount of sauce/toppings.For our mains, we ordered the Lamb Shank Special, Gnocchi, Paccheri, and the Filet Mignon. Most of our mains were a tad salty which is the main reason for the 3-stars vs 4-stars. The only mains that weren't overly salty were the Filet Migon and the Paccheri. I was a bit disappointed since we had brought family from out of town here and was looking for a great meal to exemplify the GOOD EATS in NYC.The desserts were pretty good - Panna Cotta was amazing and served at the right texture!!!

My mom and I discovered it randomly one night the week I moved to NYC, and we have gone back every time she has flown in from California since. The minestrone soup is to die for--the best soup I've probably ever had, and I LOVE soup. We adore the Cornish game hen in terms of entrees, but we had fish once and that was excellent as well. The desserts are also amazing; the tiramisu was better than the many I tried in Italy, light and fluffy and full of Kahlua-y deliciousness. I had the sorbet trio, which was also fantastic and refreshing. The ambiance, too, is so fun and the interior has a great design. The wait staff is also friendly and quick.

Nothing wrong with that, just wasn't our thing.Waiter came over immediately and asked about drink orders. Decided to go random and asked for a Gin Gimlet with bartenders choice of gin. WOW! It was Tanguary 10, another good move! Loved it!Next came the food: Hubby and I opted to go our separate ways: He had the veal chops while I had the black sea bass special. Both were mouth-watering good and we licked the plates clean. My sea bass was filleted by the waiter who did a great job. The fish was fresh, sweet, and perfectly cooked.

I wanted sausages with my gnocchi so they accommodated me as well, for the same price. My only disappointment was that we chose this restaurant based on some of the items on the menu that we saw on Yelp.

2.0,4/6/2013,"*** Warning if you are gluten free or have celiac be careful here - the waiters are not educated as to what gluten free is. They tried to tell me that the whole WHEAT pasta and the gnochhi was gluten free. When in fact it is just a giant bowl of gluten.Ok here goes. My first review. My parents were in town from Florida and we decided to go out for a nice dinner. I am gluten free so we did a little searching and found Zio. It mentions clearly on the website that they offer home-made gluten free pasta. Amazing. I met them there after work and had a cocktail at the bar before we got our table. It was happy hour the cocktails were great and we got seating right away. All good so far. My mom asks the waiter for gf bread he seemed a little confused but said yes and walked away, never to return. Our new waiter comes over and he seems a little more confident, no gf bread. Fine. Time to order. We ask specifically about the pasta, the waiter decides he needs to consult the chef. And then it happened. Whole wheat pasta is not gluten free no matter how many times you tell me it is. I would never write a review just to bash a place because I work closely with the restaurant industry and I know how complicated it is to run a good restaurant. But having waiters who are uneducated in food allergies is dangerous and could make other with gluten free allergies very sick. Dont put it on the menu as a special service if none of you waiters have any clue what your offering, and apparently neither does the chef. Otherwise I got the lamp chop. It was really great. So if you are not gf, go for it. I hope this helps other celiac people in picking a place to go, I highly recommend bistango, the food is fantastic and they are very considerate to food allergies.",4,0,0,Fiona R.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,1,0

We also tried another appetizer which was the special of the day- octopus. The dish came with 2 whole small octopuses, including their heads. The sight of the octopus head was disgusting, I'm not a fan of eating octopus brains, so I just ate the tentacles and let the braver, more adventurous people at my table tackle the head.

The waitstaff was super attentive and very helpful in advising us what to order. They suggested the wine we chose, not trying to sell us on something super expensive.

Zio doesn't cross that line.Dinner was fabulous too, with delicious courses of bread with pepper spread and other courses served family style.

Started our meal with a Bocconcini, which is some baked mozzarella goodness. It normally comes with three pieces, but they said they would make two extras so that everyone in my party could try for a higher price. This higher price was one dollar more, so that was definitely pleasant. The food didn't particularly standout and I definitely think for the price that was charged, it could have been a bit better done, but it also didn't kill the experience.

It was 5:30PM and we were only a little hungry and given the temperatures in the high 90s, extremely thirsty. I almost decided to give up and head to Starbucks when we spotted the happy hour drink special board outside. $4 draft beer was very inviting, despite the price range of the food menu being out of our reach. We were seated beside the window at the soft comfy couches and we ordered Italian beer. With the gorgeous decor and good looking staff, I knew I was definitely out of my league - was determined to have my beer and then leave. Then I noticed the happy hour food menu on the table. It was as if the sky had opened up. The prices were reasonable! And a fraction of the regular menu! I called the waiter back and ordered formaggio and salumi and a mushroom fontina bruschetta. The formaggio came with a delicious raspberry sauce, which perfectly complemented the cheese and prosciutto. Mmm. Then we ordered another beer and a wine (which came in a decanter!). So how much did this decadent late-afternoon meal cost us? $15 per person. Wuuuuut.

5.0,4/3/2012,"When evaluating any restaurant (and your likelihood to return to it) I believe there are really three core areas of focus: ambiance (which includes vibe, decor, the restaurant's ability to draw a crowd, music, etc.), service, and last but definitely most important, food.Ambiance: Zio is undoubtedly one of the most beautiful restaurants in the city.  The decor is gorgeous and the restaurant was designed with a warm color palette which lends itself to an incredibly cozy feel.  This is no easy feat considering how large the restaurant is and yet when you're there, it feels small and intimate.  It is clear that time and attention went into the overall design (I especially love the bar and the way the wine is displayed).  There is also always a seasonally appropriate floral arrangement.  I've been at Zio when the front area was configured for private parties, and have also admired the private room in the back (with a plasma), which I've often remarked would be a fabulous place for an intimate party or large dinner gathering.  The restaurant is perfectly suited to accompany an array of varying types of dinner goers (corporate cocktail/happy hours, date nights, and everything in between) and yet it's still able to maintain its Old World Italian feel.  They also know how to pack a house on a weekend night and for speciality evenings/holidays.  Overall it always feels warm, cozy, friendly, familiar, comfortable, and beautiful.Service: Everyone from the hostess to the servers to the managers, owners, and to the chef  is delightful and is 5 star quality.  The waiters are knowledgeable with regards to the menu, evening specials, and wine selection.  They're also quite attentive without being obtrusive. I've spent countless hours sitting at the same table and have never once been rushed or been made to feel anything but welcomed.  It is apparent that the staff has been expertly trained as every dish was presented with special attention to detail and with care.  From the moment I've walked in until the second I leave (which has sometimes been very late) I've always been treated exceptionally well and have always found the service to be outstanding and welcoming.  Every experience at Zio is exceptional.Food: Having lived in Italy for quite some time I can tell you that Chef Max's food is incredibly authentic, true to its Italian roots while still being imaginative, and is seasonally appropriate.  It becomes very clear, very quickly, that the chef puts an unbelievable amount of care, attention, and pride into his cuisine.  The flavors within each dish are well balanced, yet not pretentious.  Overall, when choosing to spend a night at Zio you can count on a sexy vibe and cozy atmosphere in a beautiful setting, with well timed and deliciously imaginative food, and superb service that you can always count on.",0,0,0,Ashley L.,"Manhattan, NY",0,1,0

2.0,2/27/2012,"I really hate to give such a bad review to a place with great food, but it must be done. I hope this story isnt too long....To save yourself the story, probably the victim of ageism, bad service.Had reservations, arrived a little early, but behind a group of three. We were seated right next to them right after them. I am not too young, 28, but could pass for younger. When they sat down, they were greeted promptly, offered drinks, and were given a summary of the specials and served water.Not until after the table had received their drinks from the bar and ordered appetizers were we even greeted. We ordered a beer and a mixed drink. The server made it seem as if those were odd requests. We had to ask for water while he was passing by. He came by another time to tell us specials, which he flew through and then wanted to take our order. It is hard to explain his tone, but he was making it obvious that we wouldn't buy any of the specials; which we did order. That was the last we saw of our server. The 2nd tier service (people who setup the table for apps, entrees, etc were great and very attentive.The food was really good. Wifey had this lobster thing and I had a big steak. Really good. We also had an appetizer (that I cant remember) that was very good.I am not the type to complain to a manager because having worked in a restaurant, those people usually do it in the hopes of getting free food etc. The food was great, our server was terrible.So, my claim of ageism. The table that sat down at the same time as us had the same waiter, and the two tables on the other side also had the same waiter. We were able to see his service at those other tables, and it was incomparable to our experience.Could it be a case of one bad apple in the bunch? Possibly, but there are way too many italian places in NYC where you can spend 150$ for 2 people and be treated better.Will not go again, would dissuade others from going.",1,0,0,Brian C.,"Roxbury Township, NJ",136,423,0

After calling and checking that we could get seats we came in and was quickly seated at a table by the entrance. Not a great seat to get since it was pretty cold and we could feel the wind coming in every time someone enters/leave the restaurant. We wanted to have pasta so we ordered their special for the day (recommended by the waitress) I forgot the name already but it was some spinach infused pasta with one and a half pound lobster on it (emphasized by the waitress several times when she recommended the dish). Food came, looks alright and taste alright, not amazing and not really worth the price ($40) there's better pasta elsewhere in the city. I won't be coming back again.We also tried their pappardelle ($22), which is ribbon pasta with braised lamb ragu and that came out bleh, didn't really like the taste and the portion is somewhat small for the price.  On the plus side their décor was nice, service was good, friendly and all that but the food itself --- not good at all.

5.0,12/16/2011,"Absolutely remarkable! Zio has the ambiance of a beautiful, tasteful Midtown restaurant, but with a much less pretentious clientele and more accessible prices. Myself and a friend thoroughly enjoyed every bite of the appetizers, then the entrees, then to top it off, even the desserts were sublime. We were in heaven, simply and purely.As starters, we selected the Polenta and Tartara di Tonno. The polenta was the most creamy delectable starch you could put your lips to with a sauce topping made with fresh (and ground) calamari and tomatoes. It was the first thing we tasted and really set the tone for the whole meal. Packed with wonderful flavor and texture. The tuna tartar was Japanese inspired with seaweed salad on top. The tuna itself was fantastic, and the avocado scattered within it was so creamy and fresh. The tuna and avocado were an excellent pairing.For main courses, we chose a Primi and a Pesci. The Granchio, crab ravioli with butter tarragon and pink peppercorn sauce, was divine. The ravioli wrapping itself was perfectly springy, and the tarragon butter sauce was very unique, yet approachable. The Merluzzo Nero, potato wrapped cod with cauliflower and clams, was much better than anticipated, since cauliflower and cod aren't my favorite things. The cauliflowers tasted like they were marinated in something (delicious) and then lightly roasted. Still crunchy to highlight the freshness, but seasoned and slightly charred for extra flavor. The potato wrapping was very thin, while the cod inside was light and flaky. It seemed like I was eating a lighter white fish. The name escapes me of the first dessert, but it was similar to a brownie with a very surprising texture . It was like they took a wonderful brownie, ground it up a bit, but reformed it with a thick sauce and re-set it. Sounds odd, but it was perfectly delicious. This with a dollop of ice cream and a smear of spiced chocolate on the side, it was perfect. We also had the Semifreddo, I believe, which reminded me of a more dense panna cotta with richer flavors - since it was praline and chocolate. Also, very delicious and unique. Both came with blackberries on the side. The service was very attentive, with one main waiter and (it seemed) five others waiting for our beck and calls. There are a few Maitre D's around, as well, to ensure you're having an enjoyable experience. With a few minor tweeks and improvements, I see a Michelin star in Chef Max's future. Delicious.

The ambiance, service, and food all came together for a solid 5 star experience.The restaurant just opened in June, which explains why it's not packed to the rafters - that being said, I recommend that people try this place soon before it gets hot. The open, spacious dining room transported me out of Manhattan while the décor and colors kept the space warm and inviting. Everyone at the restaurant was incredibly nice, including one of the part-owners, Darren, who stopped by at the beginning and end of our meal to check in on how our experience was.The meal starts with bread accompanied by what I can only describe as a tomato tapenade infused with olive oil. That, plus some crispy and flavorful thin breadsticks, held us over well until our entrees arrived. Our table tried the tagiolini with cherry tomatoes and basil, the farrotto (risotto with wild mushrooms and mascarpone), and the granchio (crab meat ravioli in butter tarragon and pink peppercorn sauce) and they were all fabulous. I thought it was a great touch to use organic spelt risotto for the farratto, and it was cooked to a perfect al dente. I also liked that most of the pastas on the menu were homemade and the dishes could be served with gluten free or whole wheat pasta upon request.One small note - I don't think half-size options are on the menu, but you can get them if you ask for them.

4.0,9/20/2011,"""If it's good enough for Anthony Bourdain and his wife, then it's good enough for us,"" I exclaimed, after greeting Megan and Hung for our Saturday evening dinner date at Zio.  After all, it was this particular factoid that this 'new Flatiron Italian' was even in the running (along with about three other restaurants that we had also considered).For 8:30pm on a Saturday eve, Zio was approximately between 1/4-1/3 of the way full.  I was able to chalk this up to the restaurant's very young life on the Flatiron neighborhood's dining landscape.  Slower evening aside, I was instantly warmed by the genuine care and service we received from the hostess upon our arrival, in addition to a couple of the other employees that we had first encountered. I had a good feeling about this place...We were seated in the far back corner of the grand dining room, which granted us unobstructed views of the entire space.  Overall, think: clean, sophisticated lines and an understated elegance - honey, oat, and walnut color hues - leather banquette and table/chair seating - 20+ feet ceiling heights - dimmed modern lighting.The meal was kicked off with a basket of sliced, freshly baked Italian Bread - crunchy, hand-rolled, herb-specked breadsticks - and a shallow dish filled with 'red pesto (pesto rosso),' for dipping and dunking.The three of perused the dinner menu, all the while nursing our glasses of wine.  Finally, we came to a decision: split three appetizers amongst the table and order individual entrees.AppetizersMelanzane:  Floating atop a shallow moat of warm marinara sauce was a castle, if you will, constructed of interchanging layers of lightly breaded strips of eggplant and gooey, smoked mozzarella cheese.   Spicy arugula greens crowned the top of the dish.Riso Al Salto Con L'osso:  Arborio rice, cooked to a precise 'al dente' - cooled - and then hand-formed in to the shape of a hockey puck, was encased by a Rolex-gold crust and served atop a tangy (lemon), herbaceous (parsley), and salty (beef stock, capers(?)) gremolata sauce.  Visually, what stole the show was the centerpiece of the dish: approximately 4-inches of beef bone that was sliced across the top, exposing a bountiful pool of gelatinous marrow.Personally, I found the bone overwhelming, in terms of its size.Lamb Meatballs (one of the appetizer 'specials' of the evening):  Meatballs.  The word, alone, makes my stomach growl...in a good way. Visually, this order of four perfectly plump, golf ball-sized balls was the picture of meatball perfection: enveloped in the house marinara sauce - finished with cheese - and topped with a sprig of something green, just enough of a burst of color to bring about a contrast.  Unfortunately, however, the balls were overcooked.  Like, to the point that, what should have been delicate, pink lamb meat, was 'McDonald's hamburger patty' grey.  Bummer. EntreePappardelle:  Ribbons of saffron pappardelle noodles were gently tossed with brisket-like shreds and chunks of the most tender, gristle-free lamb.  The meat was braised in a tomato-based sauce which, while still pleasant and flavorful, did not compete or overpower its star component.~ConclusionAside from the overcooked lamb meatballs, I thoroughly enjoyed every aspect of my meal at Zio.  From the sexy and sophisticated atmosphere, mature cocktail and wine lists, excellent service and, most importantly, the meal, I hope that others will also find that Zio has all of the ingredients necessary to make a long-standing home for itself in the Flatiron neighborhood of Manhattan.",0,0,0,Lindsay F.,"New York, NY",376,277,184

4.0,7/16/2011,"Good stuff. nice atmosphere, not cramped like many other manhattan restaurants.  Good place for a date, or for groups. Food was very good. Had about 8 diff items, all were good. Best was the fish special (skate), the pasta was delicious as well.  Had the Tiramisu for dessert, was enough for four to share and satisfy our sweet tooth.  Worth checking out.",0,0,0,ryan h.,"WALL STREET, NY",0,3,0

The food is beautifully prepared and Delicious! Can't rave enough about this new addition to Union Square area restaurants. Every dish was a standout; the risotto cake, swordfish carpaccio, oxtail ravioli, and we were treated to complimentary limoncello!",1,0,0,judy n.,"New York, NY",24,21,2
5.0,7/1/2011,"Zio, what else? Trully delicious italian food in a brand new restaurant with stunning open kitchen but the 5th Star is earned by the friendly, family atmosphere. Go before it gets too crowded and too loud.",0,0,0,Julien D.,"Manhattan, NY",2,4,0
