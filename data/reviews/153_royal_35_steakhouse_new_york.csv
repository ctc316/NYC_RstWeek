5.0,4/30/2019,"I wish I can give this phenomenal restaurant more than 5 stars! From the moment we walked in Sat.eve, we were treated like ROYALTY (hence the Royal 35 name)  Sherif at the bar greeted us and we were introduced to a new Prosecco I have never tried- that was fabulous!  After enjoying our drinks at the bar, we were taken to our table in a dining room that felt like it was in someones gorgeous home (cozy, welcoming but oh so elegant). The fish platter for two was to die for and the presentation spectacular. After the Royal salad, we enjoyed the finest steak perfectly prepared and out of this world!!!  Between the fabulous sides, the exquisite wine pairing &  superior service - it was an unforgettable evening. Alfred and Adam & Sherif all made us feel like family. This is a special, very special steakhouse!!",0,0,0,nicole e.,"Woodbury, NY",177,4,5
5.0,4/26/2019,"Walked in without a reservation and they sat me immediately. The dining room is dimly lit and ornamented. The wait staff was quick to bring water and offer assistance. I had already decided what to order, so I did so basically as I sat down. I was checked in on several times while I waited for my foodI had the bone in ribeye with a side of asparagus.   The steak asparagus was grilled with oil salt and pepper and was nicely done.  The serving was also more than I was expecting.  The steak was also fantastic.  Perfectly cooked (med rare) and not over salty. I'm often disipointed by a steak that hides its lack of flavor behind too much salt. The steak was served with a side of homemade steak sauce that was sweet, similar to Peter Lugers sauce. For desert I had a cream brûlée with was superb.  Overall I was very pleased.  The staff interacted was professional and respectful. One of the wait staff even asked the chef about the steak sauce because I was curious.  If I were judging based on food alone,  I would say this place is expensive but reasonable.  However,  given the location, excellent service, and good food,  I was impressed.",0,0,0,Josh F.,"Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, NY",5,7,4
5.0,4/23/2019,It was a good experience. The waiters care whether you ordered too much. One of the best French onion soups I had in the city. Porterhouse was decent I guess,0,0,0,Leanne L.,"Mobile, AL",0,21,6
4.0,4/10/2019,"Here's my take on another steak house in Manhattan. It first seems like a hole in the wall restaurant but in fact it's pretty nice inside. Once past the coat rack you get to see the thousands of pieces of meat in glass encasement just waiting to be enjoyed. The dining area isn't to large but it fit about 20 tables. It becomes quite noisy due to small area. Well, For starters I had the lobster cocktail for an appetizer, so glad I got this was debating over this and shrimp cocktail. This has to be my favorite appetizer of all time. Next was the main course. Since I was at a steak house I got the ribeye which was good. But if I go back I would have to get the Chilean sea bass. For the dessert I had the creme brûlée and that was very good. They also gave dessert wine with it on the house. Service was really good. The waiters were on point but our sides came out 20 minutes into our meal. I believe they said someone dropped the tray causing delay. At least they were honest. And the mushrooms and potatoes were also good when they arrived.",0,0,0,Robert C.,"Queens, Queens, NY",1,40,40
5.0,3/20/2019,I would love to first say Thank you for being so attentive!!! The food amazing I went in with the idea of trying the lump crab instead I got the crab cake and I couldn't be happier. The porterhouse for 2 spectacular I haven't had a good steak in a long time this hit the spot the sides are more than enough to eat and have left overs the lobster Mac and cheese amazing as well... the fact that a birthday celebration was acknowledged made our evening even greater thank you again awesome place I shall return!!!!,0,0,0,Tereza B.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,3,0
5.0,3/19/2019,"Absolutely fabulous. Thoroughly enjoyed the stuffed clams appetizer. The Porterhouse for two was exceptional... rare to medium rare and the serving platter with the sizzling juices seemed to hold the heat for quite some time allowing you to tip each piece in for a little extra. Mashed potatoes and cream spinach rounded out the main course. Dessert was good but to tell you the truth, I forgot what we split because all I could think about was the steak",0,0,0,Stuart S.,"Redding, CT",0,3,0
5.0,2/25/2019,"So here is the cliche, I went to a steakhouse and had seafood. I will say that my salmon was delicious with crisp edges just the way I love it. My dinner companion enjoyed a medium done Filet Mignon and we both had red wine to compliment. The entire staff was personal, friendly and attentive. The decor is intimate and inviting but also fit for groups and families. We were stuffed but still shared a dessert before leaving well after closing.

5.0,2/15/2019,It was my first time in New York and decided to check this place out based on reviews and it did not disappoint.  We ordered the tomahawk steak it was the best steak I've ever had.  It says serves two but more like 4.  Everything we ordered was delicious.  Would definitely go back.,0,0,0,Veronica H.,"Chicago, IL",49,9,0
4.0,2/15/2019,"Had dinner here last night. Ordered the jumbo shrimp cocktail, porterhouse for two, asparagus and German potatoes. Great presentation on the shrimp, asparagus was just okay and the German potatoes were very good. I would order the German potatoes again. The staff is very welcoming and friendly (minus our waiter - keep reading), the Pinot noir was delicious and everything was great until we complained that the steak temperature was over what we asked for. The waiter responded saying that he doesn't know the difference between the two temps because he doesn't eat his steak that way. Firstly, we never asked his preference. Secondly, I wouldn't expect him to know the difference as he isn't a cook/chef. And thirdly, an apology by itself would've sufficed because we were so hungry we didn't want to wait for another so we ate the steak as it was with their steak sauce (it was good sauce). My friend was more upset than I was. I would've been okay with just an apology because the steak was well-seasoned. I'm willing to give this steakhouse another chance and will update my review after doing so. They did give us complementary champagne and chocolate covered strawberries, which I appreciated.",0,1,0,Liz M.,"St. Albans, NY",3,24,28
3.0,2/11/2019,"I'm torn between 3 or 4 stars, but I'll stick with 3. We had a reservation for 5. We sat in the middle of the dining room but it was too loud to even attempt conversation. They moved us closer to the hallway, and it definitely helped. I don't think they weren't annoyed, if they were, they didn't show it. The Chilean sea bass was spectacular! Others ordered steak and said they were good, BIG portions. Sides were all pretty good, nothing jumps out as amazing.No complaints per say, but it was an expensive meal, and I wasn't exactly wowed either (except for my entree). Overall, keep in mind its very loud, and a very chummy old school vibe. I would recommend if you're into that sort of thing.PS: huge ceilings - therefore huge walls and they have no art or anything on the big blank walls! They have wallpaper, but it still struck me as very odd. Makes it look empty.",0,0,0,Jackie K.,"Providence, RI",1,69,0
4.0,2/1/2019,"Good food, service, and atmosphere. The steak I had was a little bit cold inside (even though I ordered medium), so I asked waiter to cook again. It was surprising, but they treated properly and I had good experience after that.",0,0,0,Takayuki H.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",95,26,17
3.0,1/20/2019,"Sad to say my husband and I were disappointed! We had such high hopes for this. First of all, we got seated in an upstairs hallway that had no ambiance at all. At 5:30 on a Saturday night, I can't imagine the downstairs was that crowded. We should've asked to move our table as we were let down we had absolutely no view at all. My Caesar salad was great and my husband said the baked clams were the best he ever had in his life. Therefore, we expected a lot from our meal! I ordered my steak medium well and the little stick in it said well done, which it was. My husband ordered his medium and said it was over cooked. The steak did not have the flavor we were hoping for. The Mac and cheese looked SO GOOD on Instagram, but I felt it had no flavor. The onion rings were greasy. The broccoli tasted like oddly Chinese food broccoli to me. Our server Remy was great. We just felt super sad to spend $250 and not leave completely satisfied. I didn't want to tell my husband how I felt, but once I heard another woman behind us say she was disappointed, I admitted how I was feeling and he agreed.",0,0,0,April F.,"Verona, NJ",0,7,0
5.0,1/19/2019,"Very relaxed atmosphere, simple menu, great wine list. Traditional setting with super service -we went for a steak and were not disappointed. We ordered a fillet which was a very generous size and two of us had a porterhouse. We were concerned not to have a steak with a rare center and our waiter brought it out on a sizzling plate and then sliced and cooked the red meat on the sides of the plate to make it just right. Perfect and totally delicious. The owner had a chat with us on our way out to ask about our food which was a personal touch to our evening. This is a definite place to visit in New York.",1,0,1,Briana W.,"Foxborough, MA",16,430,147
5.0,1/3/2019,"This place is soooo delicious!I've gone here a few times now thanks to a company outing. Every time, I never get disappointed with what I get. We always make sure to order one of the seafood towers; definitely get that when you go! The presentation is beautiful and it all tastes amazing.The steak is very juicy and melts in your mouth. The salads are very filling. The sandwiches are hearty. Nothing you order would be the wrong choice.Of course, the price is very high. But as would other steakhouses like this. I personally think it's still on the less expensive side for a steakhouse in NYC.",0,0,0,Jenn K.,"West New York, NJ",319,25,10

We ordered porterhouse steak for two but it was so big that we could share with 4 people. The steak was very juicy and they cooked it the way we asked for. Mac and cheese with touch of truffle was unbelievable. We had warm apple strudel with vanilla ice cream for the dessert and it was amazing. I wish u guys good luck and we definitely coming back!

1.0,10/29/2018,"Upon arrival, the hostess and the host(maybe manager) greeted us nicely. Reservation wasn't maybe necessary as it didn't seem too busy(was weekday dine in). However the attitude from our condescending server(Khatri) who looked down at us since the beginning was a horror. As he did not 'suggest' menu, instead he was pushing us to choose certain menu and push us to make a quick decision. We felt very pressured and rushed to choose our menu fast and menu that were more expensive. Also pressured us to order drinks as some of us can not consume alcohol. As we dine, other runners and staff seemed nice but our server almost didn't bother to check on us, felt like we were left behind. When the bill came, here is the most unpleasing part of the service. There was automatic service charge of 20% for 2 people. Not agreed upon and should not be mandatory. Customers have freedom to do a self tip. We asked the server to take off the automatic gratuity, so we can put our own gratuity, then the server's attitude changed even more drastically and said in exact word 'This is how we do' Wow, I was just amazed to hear this then he said 'How much are you gonna tip' throwing the receipt at us. We felt again pressured and felt trapped as he almost threatened us. I can't believe this horrible service really happened and it need to be concerned by the management. I would be really worried if I were the manager of this place,, We didn't want to tip at all at this point but we did include tip of 15%. Should have not tip, now I think about it. Wanted to talk to the manager but we didn't want to leave a bad taste. The only good thing was the food. Of course the food should be good since $150-200 dining experience it cost. It ruined our night so bad. Worst dining experience ever visiting NY. Not recommended.

4.0,8/17/2018,A solid NYC Midtown steakhouse experience.I ordered the bacon to start. The piece is thick and very uniformly executed with smooth combination of fat and meat. It basically tastes like a very thick slab of bacon. Sort of an odd thing to serve by itself in my opinion. I'd have like to have some acid or vegetables to accompany this starter.The filet was very good. It was a smoky grilled exterior flavor. The beef was very fresh and tender. The chew was robust but very easy to get through. The mashed potatoes on the side were OK but really didn't add much to the flavor composition of the dish. It just felt like they were there as filler.Ultimately this steakhouse is here to cater to those wishing to have a traditional steakhouse experience. And they do this well. Don't go in expecting super amazing flavors or unique ingredients and you'll be happy.,2,0,1,Jack M.,"West Chester, PA",517,806,672

5.0,8/13/2018,"Came to Royal 35 for a birthday dinner expecting typical fine dining but had my expectations far surpassed by meals end. Everything was great (impressive even)...from the food, to the service and decor. We were welcomed by a warm and friendly hostess upon arrival and served by attentive, knowledgeable, and equally friendly wait staff. We started with the jumbo shrimp, fried calamari, and crab cakes for the appetizers. All were great but I was especially (delightfully) surprised by the crab cake which I am usually not overly fond of. For my entree, I had the Chilean Sea bass. Which is the best I've had anywhere. Actually, thinking of it now, the same can be said for the entire meal from start to finish. Great presentation and flavor in every single dish. If I wanted to be petty, my only complaints would be that I wish they would be more strict with their dress code as it is rather disappointing to see people dressed in t-shirts and hoodies in such a fine establishment. And their bathroom was quite warm. Especially for a muggy summer day. But the dining area is very comfortable and cool so it's really not too much of an inconvenience.

3.0,6/12/2018,"This restaurant was disappointing.  I tried it for the first time today at lunch, and it is very overpriced for what you get.  You are really paying the rent rather than getting quality food.  I first glanced at the special cocktail menu ($20/drink) and saw nothing interesting.  I then decided to check the wine list.  I asked the bartender to recommend the best Cabernet.  I tasted 5 different bottles.  Four were terrible; so I went with the first one I tasted, which was only OK.  They apparently buy cheap bottles and then charge a fortune for a little glass of wine.  I ordered the lobster roll, expecting something delicious.  What I got was lobster salad with a little bit of lobster on a hamburger bun, not a roll.  It was OK, but not worth $26.  The accompanying salad was awful.  The dressing had no taste at all.  They could have put water on it, and it would have tasted better.  It was basically some greens dumped on the plate.  For that meal I paid $52 with tip, and could have done better elsewhere for less money.  Also, the place was virtually empty except for six other patrons eating and drinking at the bar.  This place is in midtown, and should not be empty for lunch.  I might give it another try sometime to see if their steak is any better, but after today I am dubious.",0,0,0,Dorothy Y.,"Manhattan, NY",0,12,0

Requested a booth which we were seated at without a problem. Staff is extremely friendly. We waited a few extra minutes than expected to place our order which was immediately corrected with a free round of drinks. We ordered a couple of apps and a porterhouse to share which was simply perfection (photo included). They also had the meat on display in a huge glass fridge which was very cool (photo included).

Shrimp cocktails were fresh with volcanic action on the plate with the dry ice. Caesar's salad was the same with other high end steakhouse. Porterhouse for 2 was great as well but the cut we got was probably a cut where a lot of fatty part was. 2 of the big slices of steaks were completely fat without red beef. Not saying that the taste was bad but felt like we could have enjoyed a little more red beef. But to eat his own. Atmosphere was on the darker side and would be perfect for a date night.

5.0,4/28/2018,"It's hard to describe a place like this to people.  At the most basic level, this place is a steak house.  They dry age their own beef which you can take a gander at as you walk to your table.  But to say it is just a steak house would be a disservice.The small and quaint dining room is a bustle of activity.  The staff not only works diligiently but they have fantastic team work, and by the end of my meal, I sensed more.  These guys seemed to genuinely love to work here and with each other.  It felt like family (without the yelling and swearing ).So, I started with a mixed green salad, and my companion had the jumbo shrimp cocktail.  They we're fantastic.  I added bacon to my salad, and I'm kicking myself for not having ordered their bacon as an appetizer (next time).For dinner, I had one of their bone-in ribeyes, and my companion had the twin broiled lobster tails.  My companion told me the lobsters we're amazing.  My ribeye... Was one of the best ribeyes I've ever had in my life.  It was tender, with a rich deep flavor.  The fat... was incredible.  It was perfectly cooked, and unlike a lot of chain steak houses, this wasn't over seasoned, because it didn't need to be.  The steak stood on it's own without needing so much seasoning it basically becomes a salt lick.So this absolutely fantastic meal needed dessert.  We shared an orange butter cake.  We chose it because we had seen several tables order it, so figured it must be one of their best items.  If you like a rich, dense butter cake, you'll absolutely love it.The bill came to about $210 before a tip (that includes two glasses of wine, a bottle of Pellegrino and a baked potato).  It also came with a hearty thank you and handshake from the manager as we were leaving.  I'm glad I stumbled across this hidden gem of a steak house and will definitely be back on my next trip to Manhattan.",2,0,0,Mark D.,"Boston, MA",4,98,58
5.0,4/24/2018,"5 Star for service. My husband made early dinner reservations for my birthday and before catching a Broadway show. The room we were served in was intimate and yet didn't feel cramped. Everyone was warm and welcoming. They are very knowledgeable about their menu and wine pairings. The 40 oz porterhouse to share was melt in your mouth delicious. My favorite side were the mashed potatoes and my husband enjoyed the Mac & cheese. We also tried the thick cut Canadian bacon slices and the sauce that comes with was tasty. Cremé brûlée was also the perfect way to end the meal, not too heav. We were also given a dessert moscato which was sweet but not overpowering. I think pricing was appropriate for the venue and menu.

5.0,4/6/2018,"My family and I had a delicious dinner at Royal 35 on Wednesday night. From start to finish, it did not disappoint! Loved the ambiance in the main dining room and the cute booths they have. There's also a neat meat locker you can fix your eyes on, on your way into the dining room. We shared a cold seafood tower and crab cake to start. Loved how the tower was presented with the dry ice effect! The seafood was fresh and so tasty. The crab cake was really good, too. It was a nice size that we all could share. Next, we shared a steak for four, creamed spinach, and a lobster Mac and cheese. The steak came out sizzling, was perfectly cooked and not one piece was left on the platter by the time we were done. The creamed spinach was a perfect compliment to the steak. The spinach was seasoned well and it's creaminess was in sync with my steak flavor. We also enjoyed the lobster Mac and cheese which was cheesy and gooey, exactly what you want if you're eating Mac and cheese. We didn't get a chance to try dessert because we had to catch a Broadway Show.

1.0,1/31/2018,"This was probably the worst experience I have ever had at a restaurant as well as the most money I have ever spent. My friends and I went here last Saturday and  were horrified with the service. The food itself was amazing but the staff was uncomfortably rude. When we were first sat one waiter had taken our drink order and read us the specials. Then after bringing our drinks over, he had left and after 25 minutes a completely different waiter came over and read the same specials again. Half of us at the table do sever/ have severed so we assumed that our waiter did not want to wait on us so to our ages (25-29). It continued to worsen after we put in our order, which took 45 minutes. The table of 5 sat next to us had their order before us. As we sat waiting, the waiter did not come up once between that time span to see if we needed another round of drinks. So after 30 minutes, my friend and I just got up and went to the bar to get our own drinks. To top it all off at the end of the night my friend finally complained because she made special note prior to coming, with our reservations to have a birthday dessert come out for her boyfriend (who we all were celebrating with) and it did not come out. So my friend after we paid the check made sure to speak to the manager who all he did was get us a round of shots. Safe to say i will not be going back.",0,0,0,Kaitlynn G.,"Ronkonkoma, NY",435,3,0
3.0,1/29/2018,"Came here with a group of 5 on a Friday evening around 6:30pm. The restaurant was not that busy as the dining area was still relatively empty. The hostess was nice as she was bringing us to our table and stopped along the way to show us the dry aged steaks they kept on site.We started with the seafood tower for the table ($29/per person) and thick cut bacon. The seafood tower was pretty good. Typical steakhouse prices, but the clams tasted a bit funny. Everything else was pretty good, so if you feel like splurging a bit, might as well go for it. The bacon was really good. Cooked perfectly and it was a thick cut slice. I would definitely recommend this.For our entrees everyone got their own steaks. 3 people got the bone in ribeyes and 2 people shared the porterhouse for 2. I didn't get to try the porterhouse, but the 3 bone in ribeyes were very disappointing. We each got it cooked medium rare, but  the size discrepancies were very apparent. They were also completely charred on the outside, which I understand some people like, but it wasn't really to my liking.Overall, it's a nice steakhouse and the service was good, but there are definitely way better steakhouses in NYC.",2,0,0,Calvin L.,"Manhattan, NY",229,90,282

He took my wife and I there last night.  I too now have a new favorite steakhouse.  When we arrived we decided to have a cocktail first at the bar which is open to the street.  We were greeted by Sherif, one of the three owners.  He is very pleasant, gregarious man with almost 50 years of experience who really made us feel comfortable and welcome.  The drinks were large and well made.We then went into the dining room where we were greeted by Alfred, another owner who is very knowledgable and eager to discuss the way they age their prime beef for at least 35 days. We started our feast with shrimp cocktails and thick cut sizzling Canadian bacon.  The shrimp were so large that if you encountered one in the ocean with its head on it would be terrifying.  The bacon wasn't good; it was fantastic, bursting with flavor and juicy.  I loved it.While our son had the fillet mignon, his favorite, we had the porterhouse for two.  The steak was perfect, fork tender, juicy and oh so flavorful.  Our sides were sauteed onions and asparagus, both were perfect.Our dessert was the warm orange butter cake that tasted, and smelled like it had just come from the oven.Whenever you are in midtown and in the mood for a hearty steak dinner I strongly recommend Royal 35 where they treat their customers like royalty.",0,0,1,Andy K.,"Fresh Meadows, NY",2,24,0

Lightened up the drink and gave it a nicer after taste compared to a classic cosmo along with 2 slices of bacon.  Wasn't the best bacon I've had at a steakhouse, but it was the largest.  Could be split between two.  Next was the mac and cheese which has a nice ratio of cheese to macaroni along with a bacon smoked flavor.  And lastly a porterhouse for 2 cooked medium.  Salt and pepper are placed on the table and the meat is served basically unseasoned, which said to me here's our steak season to your own liking.  Overall, great service and good food.",1,0,0,Mark T.,"Yorkville, Manhattan, NY",19,223,73
5.0,8/29/2017,"Wow!  For almost 20 years I have maintained a list of my favorite nyc steak houses. Tonight I decided try something different and used yelp to locate other steak houses in my area.  I saw Royal 35 pop up less than .25 mile from me.  I had never heard of this restaurant so I decided to give it a try.  Let me start by saying I am not easy to please in a steak house. That being said, Royal 35 exceeded all of my expectations.  Starting with the atmosphere, Royal 35 is more of a boutique feel.  It's not a noisy steakhouse.  Lounge music plays in the background and there are a few booths and a main dining room nuzzled deep in the restaurant.  They also have a private room which I saw but did not dine in.  Food:  I had a shrimp cocktail, filet mignon, side of sautéed mushrooms and the orange butter cake. The food was exceptional and I am told the beef is 35 day aged prime.  It was absolutely delicious.  The final category which I think was a true differentiator was the presence of the owners.  I am a regular in several steak houses and for years have never met the owners.  At Royal 35, I met all three owners and they were all working in the restaurant.  It's refreshing to see Managment that cares about the business and are willing to take the time to talk to their customers. Royal 35 has just jumped into my list of best steak houses in NYC and I intend to become a regular here.  I wish them continued success and hope they can maintain what they offer their customers today.",2,0,3,Lewis K.,"New York, NY",94,27,7

I cannot put into words just how amazing the entire staff is at Royal 35, they really do treat you like royalty. We went for the surf and turf and it was amazing! Medium rare filet and a juicy lobster tail is sometimes all you need to feel complete happiness. Our sides were the Onion Rings, the Hand Cut French-Fried Potatoes, and the Mac & Cheese. All sides delicious, but oh my goodness... the Mac & Cheese? to die for!!! It is a must have as one of the sides on your table. I had a beer and the pour it into a frosted tall glass and it was a glorious site to see and even better to taste. Again, the staff is so amazing and make sure that your dining experience is an amazing one. Leaving is the sad part, but knowing that I will be back makes everything good again. Thinking about getting to know their Prime Bone-In Ribeye on my next visit. I cannot forget the dessert because it is beyond delicious. You must have the Warm Dark Chocolate Cake which comes with berries and vanilla ice cream and a dusting of powdered sugar. This is one of the great desserts an establishment can have and Royal 35 steakhouse has it. At the very end we were each given a complimentary shot of Prosecco which came in the cutest mini looking wine glass. We were then given a second round and it is service like this which makes Royal 35 Steakhouse king on my list. The food and service as well as the atmosphere is in a league of its own.

This isn't like a traditional NY steak house - it almost has a lounge or even a club feel, in part due to the dance music that was playing. I have to say that I do quite like the change. The menu is as you would expect and we ordered a steak each and some sides to share (fries and sautéed broccoli). If there is one thing I expect from a steak restaurant, it is that they cook the steak how you ordered it. For me, failure to do this is inexcusable. Unfortunately that was not the case here. My medium rare steak cake out medium well - cooked completely through. My wife's medium steak came out medium rare at best. She had to send hers back, and they were happy to cook it through. Now I hate to send food back, especially when I know that they would have to start from scratch - but eventually I just had to - I was so annoyed. The manager came over and apologised and about 5 mins later I had a new steak on a fresh plate. Once corrected they both tasted perfect. The flavours were amazing and I would probably put it as the 3rd best steak I've had in NY behind Del Friscos and STK. What was frustrating is that the issue was likely all down to the waiter, who didn't write our order down, getting our order mixed up. Such a shame!In terms of the rest of the meal, the sides were fine, not amazing. They don't have a béarnaise or peppercorn sauce but instead their own steak sauce - a sort of cocktail sauce that is pretty standard here in NY. One other thing is that they don't show the steak weights on the menu so who knows what size you will get - mine was sufficient though",2,0,1,James G.,"New York, NY",24,128,182
5.0,7/10/2017,Amazing! For the first time in my life I can say that the NY strip part of the Porterhouse (for 2) blew the filet part of the steak out of the water. From the moment you walk in to the moment you leave the staff was over the top and treated us like royalty. The bacon is mouthwatering along with the steak and the warm orange butter cake. Excellent wine selection and gluten free options. Thank you for a wonderful evening out without the kids.,0,0,0,Jane D.,"Park Ridge, IL",0,50,30

5.0,5/8/2017,"I made a reservation here for my husband's birthday. I know he loves Peter Luger's but honestly, I didn't feel like dealing with them. We walked in, and they were ready for us, ""we have a reservation?"" ""Tova? right this way.""We were introduced to their walk in freezer where they age their meat. All of the servers and staff were super nice and attentive. While we were dressed up a bit, it appeared there was no dress code, despite the formal-feeling setting. I had the Royal 35 margarita. I'll be honest, my allergies were so bad I couldn't taste it at all, so I can't really tell you about it. My friends had the pinot noir. For starters we got the thick cut canadian bacon and the clams. For the main, we got the porterhouse for three. For sides we got the mac and cheese, french fries and the creamed spinach. French fries were good. The mac and cheese, pretty much my favorite style of mac and cheese, loved it. The cream spinach we could have done without. The taste was fine, but it was creamed to the point that it reminded my friend of baby food. Still tasty though. Dessert, along with the limoncello my husband got the chocolate mouse, my BFF and I shared the sherbet and my BFF's husband got the creme brulee. We ended up with a lot of leftovers, there was so much food. Overall? Skip Peter Luger's and come here. You won't have to wait three months for a reservation.

2.0,4/10/2017,"2 stars at this price.I'm not really sure what all these 5-star reviewers saw in Royal 35, but it was the most disappointing steakhouse I've been to in my life. No matter the price point, all I really ask for in a steakhouse is attentive service and correct meat temperature. So when I get neither... naturally something's very wrong. Especially when other reviews claim ""amazing service"" and our table doesn't see anyone for long periods of time.You're probably reading this review because there are now 15/17 5-star reviews, and then there's my experience. Or you might be thinking to yourself, ""Why does a Yelp 5-star steakhouse open for a couple months still seem barely-reviewed on Yelp or otherwise? Why is OpenTable still giving away 1000 point dinner tables at such a highly rated place? What kind of name is Royal 35 anyway?""I had all these questions and more... but despite my doubts, my family decided to visit on a Sunday night for a double-birthday celebration, table of 5. As soon as you walk in, you are greeted by its nouveau riche elegance, like the feeling of going into an overpriced lounge in Meatpacking. The restaurant was well-staffed on a Sunday evening, especially given the fact that only 5-6 out of ~15 tables in the main dining room were filled. On the way into the dining room, the meat closet proudly displays their dry-aged beef hanging inside... interesting touch, but maybe off-putting to some.We were seated in the middle of the dining room. The five of us were promptly served water, but then for about 10 minutes the staffers shuffled around, just barely out of sight of my gesturing. Finally, the waiter must have been informed we were seated, passed out menus and disappeared. Another 10 minutes passed before he returned, and for whatever reason he was snappy as he ran off specials and took our orders. End of day jitters, I assumed.We shared a few wedge salads (very delicious) and one person got the French onion soup (bland). Can't all be winners, I guess. Three of us then decided on the bone-in ribeye, two ordered the filet mignon, and ALL of us ordered our steaks medium-rare. If there's ONE THING a steakhouse should have down cold, it's meat temperature. A steakhouse might even clarify to a customer and say something like ""warm red center"" in case the DINER isn't sure what the temperature means. Royal 35 didn't clarify to us, but I didn't think that to be a problem... at the time.We get our steaks and 2/5 steaks were medium-rare, 2/5 were medium, and one was on the verge of medium-well. Now for whatever reason, after the server dropped off our steaks and two sides (mediocre creamed spinach for $12, average sauteed mushrooms for $13), not one staffer came anywhere near our table for the next twenty or so minutes. No water refills or wine refills, and most importantly, NOT ONE ""is the steak prepared to your liking/temperature?"" If we're paying over $50 per cut, the bare minimum we can expect is some semblance of service and proper temperature. The steak itself was pretty bland and required gobs of their ""house made steak sauce"" to be palatable.By this point there were only four tables left in the whole restaurant, and the staffers seemed to know two of the tables further away and lingered there (maybe the fabled 5-star reviewers?). We were really hungry having waited so long, so by the time the owner/manager finally came to us and asked ""how is the food?"", our steaks were half-eaten. My parents who are non-confrontational by nature just smiled, but I was pretty upset by this point. I told him that the majority of our steaks were overcooked, to which he apologized and said ""we can make you new ones if you want"". My parents claimed they were full, to which he replied ""we'll take care of you then"" and promptly left. I couldn't even finish the rest of my bland, dry steak.We split two non-memorable desserts, and when we got the bill we found that ""taking care of us"" meant comp'ing our desserts (not sure if this was due to the service or our two birthdays). No more apologies, no need for concern, it seemed this was like any other day to them. The owner/manager's initial acknowledgement of fault was what gave them a second star, but much too little too late. Not the usual hyper-attentive service you might expect at most upscale American restaurants.From what I gather from these other reviewers -- if not incentivized -- that this place has potential, but both service and food are HIGHLY inconsistent. Since those other two tables seemed happy with their meal and were chatted up for long periods of time, I'm not sure why we were consciously (or subconsciously) discriminated against. Or, we've been fortunate enough to check out many other steakhouses and know by now there is just so much more to life... and steak... out there.Royal 35 staff and cooks need major re-training if they're going to make it in the competitive NYC market. Recommend pretty much any other steakhouse at this price.",3,7,2,Richard T.,"New York, NY",241,34,2

3.0,3/26/2017,"I took my husband to Royal for his birthday dinner. We happen to be big steak eaters, and have been to many top steakhouses. We chose this place because of the great reviews. I hate to say that I was disappointed. First we had the lobster cocktail which was a feast for the eyes, beautiful displayed. It was served with 3 different dipping sauces. The lobster was tough to chew but the sauces were very good. My husband ordered the canadian bacon which was very tasty but very salty. It was served with a homemade steak sauce which was also very good. He also had the Caesar salad which was delicious with homemade dressing and croutons. My daughter and I shared the porterhouse for 2 and my husband had the rib-eye. The porterhouse was perfectly cooked (medium) and so was the rib-eye. Meat was very tender but lacked seasoning. It was somewhat bland and one should never have to put salt on a fine steak in a top steakhouse. The sides...mashed potatoes were bland, I had to put salt and pepper on it (that's a no no), creamed spinach was very good, not too creamy, mac n' cheese was good but a bit soupy and thin. Of course we had dessert and that's where everything fell apart. I ordered the chocolate mouse cake which tasted old and definitely not homemade. It was obviously ordered from somewhere and somewhere not good. My husband had the key lime pie which was awful. Very sweet and tasted nothing like it should. My daughter had pecan pie and it was ok but also disappointing. A great restaurant should always have great desserts because that's the last thing you eat and the last thing you remember. Cappuccino was excellent. The service was excellent, maybe too good. It was somewhat empty and we had waiters floating around us too often. They need to learn when to back off. Definitely not a 5 or 4 star steakhouse. We won't be going back.",4,2,1,Bridget H.,"Manhattan, NY",71,12,7

The entire staff was extremely friendly, personable, and very attentive. They provided us with great recommendations, the manager was very welcoming, and the entire staff really treated us like royalty. The food was delicious and it was clear that the restaurant knew what it did well and specialized in these areas. We really enjoyed the tuna tartare and each of our dishes arrived sizzling and cooked to perfection. The filet mignon was so flavorful and the NY Strip was delicious. We really enjoyed everything we tried including the German Potatoes and asparagus. If you are able, save room for dessert as the Chocolate Mouse was excellent.Royal 35 also had a great ambiance and set-up. When you enter, you have a small bar and a few tables for grabbing cocktails and something a bit more casual. Down a hallway and past a glass case where you can view the aging meat, is a dimly lit room with a range of tables. The set-up was intimate and made you feel like you had your own private dining area.

We had wonderful personable servers who seemed to make every effort to make us feel comfortable and well taken care of. Food: Seafood Tower: I LOVED this. You've got it all: lobster, shrimp cocktails, oysters and clams. Everything was amazingly delicious - I was most excited and impressed with the lobster. I'm not quite sure how it was cooked, but boy was it delicious. Tuna Tartare: It tasted like guacamole and tuna tartare; I quite enjoyed this dish. Filet Mignon: Delicious steak, cooked the way I wanted it to perfection. They know how to cook a mean steak. Prime ribeye: Boy.. when that steak came and you hear it sizzle... your mouth just waters. I tried a bite and it was wonderful, Sides: Creamed Spinach: I am a huge fan of creamed spinach! While it was not extremely creamy, I still loved it and I felt it balanced out the taste of the steak. Baked potato: Quite large potato - while there wasn't anything quite special about this, just the taste of a freshly baked potato with chives and sour cream completely my meal.

5.0,2/19/2017,We have been to many steak houses. But this was possibly the best steak houses I every been too. I was very impressed with the food and service i have received. After i found out that Adam one of mangers and owner at Royal was brothers with Benjamin from Benjamin steak houses. Those guys know what there doing. Even though the restaurant is three week old the place got very popular and it was packed. I think the decor of this place was very skilled. We will definitely come back.,0,0,0,Delon V.,"Staten Island, NY",1,6,1
5.0,2/19/2017,"I have already dined here a few times and I must say I am very impressed.  I had some issues with appetizers one day but the owners were quick to handle it and even offered to cover the check, which of course I didnt accept.   But the other times the food was excellent.  I am impressed that they went all out from the outset......top notch service and quality food.   I expect Royal35 to be around a long time and to be one of my go to Steakhouses.   Oh, and thumbs up to Sherif, one of the best bartenders in the city.",0,0,0,Rick E.,"Yonkers, NY",96,44,9

Needless to say, I have had some pretty good meals in my lifetime. This is one that stands out. The food was great, the staff was superb, and the ambience was perfect.  The lobster bisque was the best I have ever tasted. The fillet mignon was fantastic.

5.0,2/13/2017,"This place is incredible. They do everything right!  From the minute we walked in we were treated like royalty. We were promptly and greeted shown to a table but paused by the meat locker to hear about their aging process. They are quite proud it It with good reason! The porterhouse for 2 was phenomenal--prefect crust and melt in your mouth consistency. Did I forget the blue point oysters .. hardly - they were so fresh. Mushrooms, creamed spinach,and mashed potatoes as sides made for the perfect meal. But there's more... after a couple of delicious bites of cheesecake, a bottle of white chocolate liquor appeared and I was in heaven This taste is beyond great and a perfect way to end the night Thank you for a great time. The servers were attentive and knowledgeable and a stop by from Ralph and Chef were just the right touches We'll be back.. keep up the excellent work!",0,0,0,NYkrr B.,"CAPE ELIZ, ME",3,47,1

From the minute we walked in we were greeted and seated right away && it seemed as if the staff had known us our whole lives. For our appetizer we ordered the slab bacon which was beyond expectations && our entree, the porter house for two is a must. have. I n c r e d i b l e is what it was.

5.0,2/3/2017,"This is my new local meat sweats spot. Came through on all aspects after an absolute garbage Greek place tried to make a run at being the worst service overpriced Greek joint in the city.  See my prior reviewGet right to it. This place just emanates luscious protein aged to perfection. Walk pass the meat gallery yourself on the way to the table.  I got the porterhouse obviously - rare - cooked like a real pro - salty and crunchy outside and buttery and moist inside (like I like a lot of things).My date, Mike D, got the filet because he is overweight and sacrificed some flavor for waist size - I'm overweight too but couldn't do it - Got fatter and enjoyed it fully.  Paired with a nice wine this went down nicely - Didn't leave a single morsel - This will probably stay undigested for several days but this is life.  Filet good to but hard when compared to the apex of the porterhouseSides cream spinach and LOBSTER MAC - Real pumped because I just realized I have the leftovers in my fridge now!!!Tuna rat-rat (tartar) was great, crunchy chips to enjoy withFrench onion was solidMy old fashioned was great and service was spectacular.  Prices not crazy for NYC steakhousesThink this one will stick if they can get the word out that it's there - I only found it because I was walking home - get promoting so I can come back for years to come.I'll be back!!!!!And I came back yesBrought my parents here last week  for my second appearance  and I was even more impressed.

4.0,1/29/2017,I had a pretty great experience at the steakhouse. The steak was delicious as it should be but the service did not meet my expectations. First the waitress that was serving me and my friends was very impatient. My friend was asking her questions about items on the menu because she's allergic to certain items and the waitress was answering very curtly. She told my friend that any allergy she could possibly have would be written down in the descriptions of each item. My friend who is very allergic to the certain item was very hesitant to order it. She decided to trust the waitress and she order the item and thankfully there was none of the food items she was allergic to inside. But I recommend that you ask about the food items in each description. Hopefully you will not have a waitress or waiter as impatient as mine. If you're wondering why I gave this review for stars it is because the food was absolutely delicious. This service could be improved though. My problem was the woman was being very impatient and we were some of the only people inside of the steakhouse at a very odd time.I do highly recommend but if you're severely allergic to anything I would make sure to ask about the ingredients. Hopefully won't have a waitress as impatient as mine.,0,0,0,Ellie C.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",1,30,0
5.0,1/28/2017,"Thrilled to have such a great new steakhouse within walking distance of Grand Central. Benjamins used to be my choice in that area, but their after work crowds and long waits are a turnoff. From now on it will be Royal 35 for me since the food is just as good and the atmosphere feels more refined. Their steaks are excellent because their oven is hot enough to get a beautiful char on the outside without taking the center past rare. The bacon app is as good as Benjamins, which is to say it's ridiculously delicious. Also, don't sleep on the veal chop; it's superb too. The bar area is a bit too small which is a shame, because Sherif is the kind of veteran barkeep that will draw a loyal following and deserves a bigger stage to hold court. From top to bottom, everyone I've met there so far including Adam, Alfred, and Larry, have all been super welcoming. If they ever decide to add prime rib to their menu there would really be no reason to go anywhere else for steak. Bottom line- they're doing a lot of things right and are off to a great start. I hope they're successful.",2,0,1,Steve M.,"White Plains, NY",15,13,9
5.0,1/27/2017,"I'm still stuffed!  I went to Royal 35 this week and had a literal feast.  Our table started with a Ceasar salad and then split huge slices of delicious bacon, which perfectly complemented the salad.  Then it was onto the mains...we ordered the veal chop and a porterhouse for two, which was enough for five people!  Got a bunch of delicious sides including mac n cheese, creamed spinach, German potatoes and onion rings.  Our table got a selection of desserts and I will say, don't leave no matter how stuffed you are without trying their creme brulee which was the perfect way to end a fabulous meal.",4,0,0,Marie A.,"New York, NY",49,137,17

This place is a great addition to dining options in east midtown. The space is perfect for a midtown steak house--comfortable for work crowd, tourists, dressed up or casual.

5.0,1/26/2017,"I dined at Royal 35 last night for their first night of official service. I have been at opening nights before and typically they do not go well. This was clearly the exception!Royal 35 had it all together already. It started with a warm greeting at the door. The place is beautifully decorated and lit. Very classy without being over the top. The food was completely on point. We had the oysters and shrimp cocktail which was so fresh, chilled perfectly, and so tasty.The porterhouse for 2 was as good as you will find in NYC. I put up their with the famous Peter Luger Porterhouse. They also display their aging box for the meat in the dining room which is pretty cool. The chef clearly has done this before.The final ingredient that sets this place apart is the bartender/partner Sharif. He is for my money the best bartender in the city. I have been frequenting his places for a long time but all you need to do is come in once and you will leave as a friend.Royal 35 is definitely my new ""go to""New York restaurant!

5.0,1/22/2017,"I've had ""dry aged"" steak before, but either in process or preparation they didn't come close to what I had here.They're not afraid to make the unsightly process center stage. The dry-aging racks are prominently displayed in their beautiful seating area, along with shelves of their great wine selection. They had booths, a large rear dining room, a private upstairs one, and a bar area with a great whiskey selection. The staff were professionals, but also very friendly and kept me company until my meal arrived.I ordered the ribeye for lunch, as rare as possible. It came with creamed spinach and mashed potatoes, along with a completely unnecessary steak sauce (don't even bother with it). The steak was the star, but the sides were perfect as well. They didn't overpower the steak, and weren't so rich they filled you up, the spinach especially was very well balanced. The crust on the steak was absolutely amazing. I've researched and attempted numerous searing methods at home but nothing comes close to their finish. It was also the first steak that made me think of dry aging as more than an overpriced novelty, and their 45 day process seems to be the perfect length. The beef flavor was just sensational. Even though I came for lunch the portion size was also quite filling.The place just opened up below my apartment and I spent a lot of weeks looking through the construction, it well worth the buildup and I plan on returning. Other restaurants might call themselves steakhouses because they have dozens of different variations of sauces and toppings, but this place focuses on the steak itself and is the authentic real deal. I recommend going before the news spreads and you can't get a reservation.",3,1,1,Raj N.,"New York, NY",0,5,1

5.0,1/19/2017,"I was in the area with my boyfriend and walked past Royal 35. We noticed it was new and we were hungry, so We tried it out. We are so happy we did! The food and the service were top notch. We started out with the tuna tartare which was to die for (and I'm a TT snob) and the lump crabmeat, which was so tender. Then we shared the porterhouse for 2. One word: delicious! I wish I took pictures of the food, but we ate it too fast! The place is beautiful. Very intimate. They have a ton of wines and champagnes and they are all displayed. I am so happy a quality steakhouse opened in midtown that gives each guest a personalized, special experience. Bravo Royal 35!
