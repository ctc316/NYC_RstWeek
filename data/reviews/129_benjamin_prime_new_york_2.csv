5.0,5/1/2019,"We walked into Benjamin Prime and they immediately earned themselves five stars. Wait what!?! Yeah, their SERVICE is top notch and I was sold before even seeing a menu. Both the two hostess and barman were gracious, friendly and professional and I felt as though I was being welcomed into a friend's home instead of a restaurant. We didn't have a reservation (suggested) but was seated in the balcony (our choice) almost immediately. For my appetizer I chose a dish off the bar menu instead of their main menu. Good selection because my fillet crostini was so good! It was three pieces of beef, I cannot remember which cut but they were individually covered in peppercorn, brunaise and blue cheese. Even though they were all tasty, next time I'd have them all in blue cheese. Our mains and desserts were equally delish and I would recommend here anyday. The first floor was a bit jovial. I realized many were celebrating birthdays so it was nice to dine in the balcony where it was quiet but you're still able to enjoy the festivities downstairs. I only saw male waiters but ladies!!! Those men will have you eating out of their hands! (Pun hahaha). Did they deliberately choose (exotic looking) male models as servers??? Thank you! Picture it, dinning surrounded by all this fine art both restaurant AND STAFF. Woooooosah, hand me a fan because I AM a fan! Yes lorsh. Back to earth....And once again, I must reiterate how wonderful the service/staff, venue and food here was. Beautiful all around. I'll be back.

4.0,4/27/2019,"Located near Grand Central Station, Benjamin Prime opened in 2016 and combines the 'greatest hits' of the menus of both Benjamin's Steakhouse (located on the next street) and Seafire Grill.The ambience and decor is modern with high ceilings and some interesting architectural features (5 wall mounted fireplaces behind glass).Service is very, very attentive with lots of handshaking.  The food is typical steakhouse fare, though well executed and tasty. The restaurant was busy - it says something that the owners have opened two locations in Japan where the current trend is a fascination with the New York steakhouse.Minor grouse, I had a glass of bourbon and thought the ice to liquor ratio was a little on the high side - but it seems the business model in many restaurants is focused on squeezing profit from the liquor pour / wine glass.Dinner was enjoyable, car parking (after 7:00pm straight forward).",0,0,0,Jeffrey B.,"Manhattan, NY",6,104,368

The crust is fantastic without being over salted, excellent use of the natural juices of the steak, and always cooked to perfection (although is there another way to eat a steak than medium rare?

3.0,3/29/2019,"Went to Benjamin Prime this afternoon for lunch. I got the $39 prix fixe ""power lunch"" special. TL;DR, it's probably best to order off the main menu.Bread basket was tasty, three varieties. Provided olive oil and ricotta to dip/spread. Not up to Smith & Wollensky's quality but I was happy with it.Appetizer of grilled calamari had good flavor but was rubbery and chewy. Just overcooked. I could barely get my butter knife through it. Avoid.I also ordered a piece of the grilled thick-cut bacon off the main menu, which was just fantastic, great char, fatty, smoky, just delicious. Easily up to Luger's standards.Main was the sirloin steak, which I ordered rare and it was properly cooked rare. It was also pretty tough and did not taste dry aged. The oversized steakhouse knife they gave me was not serrated which is fine, but it also wasn't actually SHARPENED, so I had to saw away at my steak. At what was supposed to be a real steakhouse!Dessert was a piece of pecan pie, which was excellent. Strongly recommend it. Coffee was fine. This was a pretty cheap meal for a real steakhouse, but as in most things in life, you do get what you pay for.",0,0,0,rodalpho c.,"Manhattan, NY",0,15,1

5.0,2/26/2019,"We were in NYC for a long weekend of touring and dining. My wife had never been to the Big Apple, so I decided to spend a long weekend with her in the Central Park area. We had a few high end steakhouse recommendation, and Benjamin was close to us, and had availability for when we wanted to dine. What a gem! From the moment we walked in and were received by the front staff, everyone had a genuine smile on their face. We were taken to our table, and the service was nothing short of impeccable. There was no wait, and we were asked what kind of water we wanted to drink. Fresh bread and butter followed. Then Sean, the manager came by to see how we were doing. Our food was delicious. I am a foodie who likes to cook, so I tend to be critical in restaurants, since I find a lot of my homemade meals turn out better than what I get in most restaurants. Not at Benjamin's! The appetizers, main course, and desert were all outstanding. The service was perfect. Our water glasses were refilled before they were down to 1/3. We enjoyed chatting with Sean, and my wife felt this was the dining highlight of her trip.Very rarely does a restaurant impress me like this. This is a well-oiled establishment with a great ambiance, great service, great food, and very reasonable prices for NYC. We will now make this a go-to place every time we visit the Big Apple!",2,0,0,Marc K.,"Westchester, Los Angeles, CA",81,41,10
2.0,2/25/2019,"I have visited the original Benjamin's Steakhouse in the past and thought it was amazing! This ""Prime"" location was a first and a sad LAST! It was a polite and professional checkin along with quick seating. Upon being seated we were asked on our preference of water and then provided with a drink menu. The bread was subpar and lacked any variety- not good at all. We ordered a Martini, two glasses of wine, and a cocktail. One glass of moscato came out in a champagne flute, and the cocktail came out in what appeared to be a faux crystal standard tall glass as opposed to short cocktail glass. (It May seem like I'm splitting hairs but if you go to Mastros at the same price, they will pay attention to the detail). We all ordered the Filet Mignon along with 3 sides of: Creamless Creamed Spinach (Meh), Brussels Sprouts (AMAZING), and Lobster MAC n Cheese (it was ok). The steaks came out properly cooked but I have never been so UNDERWHELMED in my life. Mine was bland, no real taste, and I think a tell tale sign of this was that they had steak sauce on the table prior to arriving. We should have run as that should never be needed. For a $58 steak we should be drooling but not only did I only eat half, but everyone else at my table only finished a portion. That's FAR from the standard at an upscale steakhouse. In the end they did remember that I was celebrating an anniversary for my friends and they did bring out a complimentary creme brûlée dessert for them which was nice, but again this is a standard when comparing it to Mastros! Overall, I will not head back to this steakhouse; when you spend $600 for a party of 4 you expect to be blown away. Although the service was decent and they were extremely nice I can't see this exact establishment remaining with the quality of food and lack of drink/glass knowledge. Lastly, for a steakhouse you expect prime cuts of meat as an option: No Japanese Wagyu, rather American wagyu (what?!). It was quite limited and a significant attempt to copy Mastros or something similar. We didn't complain and ultimately accepted the fate of dinner. This is what experiences are for- some are good and some not so great! Lesson learned!",0,0,0,Omar Z.,"Battery Park, Manhattan, NY",163,6,0
5.0,2/21/2019,"First off our waiter Grant was amazing!!! The food was amazing as well! My boyfriend and I both got the bone-in ribeye. The portion is HUGE! Neither of us could finish our steaks so make sure you come hungry! The meat was perfect aged and melt in your mouth tender! The natural umami of the meat coated your tongue with every chew. It was perfectly seasoned and needed no additional salt. Mh boyfriend ordered his steak medium well, which was really the perfect level of doneness. My medium rare was good, but it was better medium well. We had the Canadian bacon appetizer. Thick slabs of belly bacon perfectly charred. So fatty and delicious. Be warned though that there is quite a lot of fat in the bacon.  But as they say fat is flavor. We had crispy Brussels on the side. The flavor was good, a bit oily. The star was definitely the meat.

3.0,2/15/2019,"We were not blown away by this restaurant. In fact, we were disappointed. We ordered the prime salad and the porterhouse for two. The salad was nothing special and soggy and the steak which was $110 came to our table bloody fast and what's worse it wasn't even piping hot. Our speculation is the meat was precooked and then thrown on the grill for a few minutes before being presented to us. What's more, the steak lacked flavor.  There are so many good steakhouses in the city. Please step it up, Benjamins! Three stars because the server was nice. However, food quality is a 2.",0,0,0,Sam C.,"Portland, OR",53,42,0
5.0,2/14/2019,Probably one of the best steaks I have ever had. Wonderful place and atmosphere. Had the Rib-Eye steak which was amazing with salad and mashed potatoes. Waiter was tentative and professional and recommended the steak. Was there on Valentines Day. Didn't wait long for my table. Had reservations. Cheesecake was to die for.

1.0,2/12/2019,"I would not return to this steak house ever again.I recommend going to the original steak house or somewhere else. There is a new manager who is very young and does not have experience. We had a business dinner arranged at this restaurant. The client arrived early. When we arrived the client informed us that the people behind us, three men, who were obviously very drunk, had already dropped 4 glasses on the floor and he asked us to be careful about the glass. We tried to focus on our dinner and the business at hand. Unfortunately, the three men drank even more and kept on screaming and yelling. The bartender apologized and so did the waiters. We spoke to the manager and he said he was sorry and would talk to them. He only took them more and more drinks. The people kept on getting louder and more crazy. The manager continued to give them more drinks. We ended our dinner short and we uncomfortably got up and decided to leave. One of the drunk men, came up to us and started being rude and started to try to start a fight. The manager came over and spoke to the drunk men by their first name. We were continuously insulted and provoked. One of the waiters spoke to us and told us that the men had been drinking and aggressive for over 4 hours and that they were friends of the new young manager. I would recommend that if you would like a nice steak house you go to a peaceful and professional and safe environment. Skip this location. It's sad but it has shifted into more of a rowdy irish pub for very drunk patrons. The management only cares about serving their own friends and giving them free drinks to make it look like the restaurant is not as empty as it seems. Please go to the real restaurant and avoid this empty and cheap copy of the original. Otherwise, go to any other professional and serious, but real NY steak house. This is not an Irish bar or pub, but it is not a real steak house anymore either. It's a strange mix. It's sad to see the beginning of the end of this fine establishment.",0,0,0,Dpb D.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,6,35
5.0,2/1/2019,"Visited NYC, walked 5 blocks during the Polar Vortex to catch dinner at a highly rated steakhouse, Benjamin Prime. Warmly greeted and seated promptly. Restaurant venue is very upscale. Anthony greeted me and offered several recommendations for entrees and he brought over the wine book. Ordered lobster bisque and medium well bone in ribeye. Anthony confirmed I enjoyed a char and light pink center steak. Food was hot, tasty and prepared perfectly. What I really enjoyed, beyond the great service (1) their proprietary brand of steak sauce (2) manager visited table, noticed I was reading a book and he turned up the light over my table. Kudos on both!Home made cheese cake finished off the meal with a sniffer of Grand Marnier Cuvee du Centenaire 100 Liqueur. The very cold weather and late hour are likely why the dining room only had a few guests. The bar, on the other hand, was busy. My table was 10' away, when the Mgr turned up the light over my table so I could read.I mentioned I hope the Boy Band members who were singing in the bar didn't migrate over to the now brighter spot light on my table. Aagh. They weren't boys and they weren't really a band but they were singing, Karaoke style but without the (needed) words on a screen.

The place was half-empty on a Friday night, yet we had indifferent service. We ordered two glasses of the same wine, but were not offered a bottle as an alternative as the adjacent tables - with solo diners, but younger - were offered. Even worse, I ordered the bone-in Prime rib. Based on 30+ years of having prime rib, I have serious doubts that I was served prime.

We were 30 minutes early for our reservation, but got seated right away. We got the grilled calamari and baked clams for apps. The grilled calamari had a Smokey taste, the baked clams could've been baked a little longer. For our entree we got the lobster Mac and cheese, mashed potatoes and the porterhouse for 3 cooked medium. The steak itself could've fed 4 instead of 3. The meat was cooked to perfection, perfectly seasoned. We even had to take it to go. The lobster Mac was a little heavy, mash was perfect. The service was fast, have no complaints, our serve was very attentive. I've been to Benjamin before coming to prime and I must say I prefer Benjamin than prime. Benjamin's baked clams were perfect, and I felt the meat was just more tender. I would prefer going back there.

3.0,1/9/2019,"2.5, but I'll round up bc I'm feeling generous and enjoyed my company.  The food was decent but there are several better options in the price range.  The waiters were pleasant enough but the wine service turned me off bc it felt like the somm was just trying to pump the check. Food: Cardinal sin for a steakhouse, overcooked meat.  Ordered the porterhouse for two medium rare and it was unevenly cooked, medium well in some places.  Not good for $100+.  The $6/slice bacon appetizer was tough.  Potato and mushroom sides were good.  Drinks:  Wine service by the bottle was slow and a single glass of sparkling took 45 mins and arrived with the main course.  We were ready for some good wine and there's a large list with some reasonable and unreasonable markups.  I asked the somm for guidance on a full bodied French wine in a price range that allowed for a large section of the non-special reserve wines.  Cardinal sin #2: I was immediately steered toward something 20% above my request.  Don't expect values or much helpful guidance.  We ended up with two aged bottles and were able to get them decanted but it took  patience that had already worn thin waiting on the bottle itself.  Some of the delay was understandable because it was a Saturday night during the holiday season and it was jammed.  Key lime pie was good and complementary port was a nice touch.  I had a better experience at the regular Benjamin steakhouse but this room was nicer.",0,0,0,Markus S.,"Manhattan, NY",1,8,0

4.0,12/29/2018,"I struggled as to how to rate this place.  My husband and I talked about it and he felt it was 4 star worthy for the following reasons:  The filet, which was either 8 or 9 ozs (the menu doesn't tell you) was excellent---great quality meat and cooked to our liking.  Service was excellent!   My husband really liked his shrimp cocktail.  The bread in the bread basket was very fresh.The waiters were friendly.  I know the place is owned by Albanians.  Being half Albanian myself, I asked (even though I already knew the answer) our waiter if he was Albanian, telling him I was half.  At the time I asked, another waiter was helping him bring our food out.  They both told me that lots of Albanians work there.  Also, they were very interested in knowing where in Albania my grandparents were from.All that said, there were some missteps.  I ordered a whiskey sour and what came was straight whiskey.  Our waiter took it back to the bar and it was corrected, even though it was not the best I've had.The lobster bisque was creamy but on the bland side.  An interesting touch was that they put the oyster crackers right into the bisque, instead of on the side.The steak sauce is their own house brand.  It was really sweet and reminded us of ketchup.  We really didn't care for it but the steak was so good that a sauce wasn't needed.We ordered 2 sides.  one of which was asparagus which was grilled to perfection.  However, unlike other steakhouses, there was no hollandaise sauce.  The second side was old fashioned hash browns which were bland and forgettable.Seating was very tight here.  Even though the place wasn't very busy as we ate an early dinner on a Monday night, we were still seated right next to another two top---so close that you could hear all their conversation.  However, I supposed I shouldn't complain as it is Manhattan after all and like many restaurants, they cram tables together.When all was said and done, we were left wanting.  When you splurge on a meal (and yes, this was a real splurge!) you should walk away feeling good about it to the point where you long to go back again.  That just didn't happen here.So...the 4 stars was mainly due to the quality of the filet plus the service.  Would we go again next time we're in town?   That's still up for debate but in all likelihood, probably not.  It's NYC and so many restaurants, so little time...",73,36,61,Susan H.,"Reston, VA",457,688,1316

We both ordered them to be cooked medium rare. The sides were sautéed broccoli which was alright and the gravy which paired well with the sir loin.

(see 2nd half of review.) portions (side) were small and incredibly expensive. maaaaaaybe enough for one person (as in need to order multiple sides per person). we ordered 1.5 sides per person and we were still short (BARELY a taste). yes, we ordered multiple appetizers and a whole entree per person. good wine selection, again i think over the top pricing (yes, i know it's ""prime"" manhattan) but still, i was in food service as well as sales, and there was absolutely nothing spectacular warranting the price. service was meh. spots and dirty wine glasses, silverware. yes, i guess it could have been water spots but come on, at over $200/person, i'd like some clear wine glasses. the clincher is FOOD POISONING. a third of our party got food poisoning (and we had not hung out the few days before and parted ways after the meal) and this was across different couples, so something, food/drinks got to them. personally did not experience this but my significant other was one of the ones affected. we will not be back.",0,0,0,Scarlette T.,"New York, NY",56,364,186

After 45 min of wait I asked to see the manager ""which was not to be found"" and decided to leave. Not after the host said she was looking for us earlier - out right lie as I was standing in front of her the whole time and came twice to check on the status of our table.Don't know it the steaks are as good as claimed and honestly don't care.

Delicious appys included the calamari, tartare duo and shrimp cocktail. However, A MUST TRY IS THE PRIME SALAD. We were just blown away by the arugula, pickled onions and delectable crab which was perfectly complemented by its dressing. This was not just a salad!Entrees were filet mignon, tomahawk steak and the tuna over bok choy. All were delicious. Our friend actually finished the tomahawk steak, which was a feat in itself. Our sides of mashed potatoes, corn and Brussel sprouts were great as well.We finished our perfect meal with cheesecake and tiramisu. Just the right sweetness to finish the evening.

5.0,11/11/2018,"Benjamin Prime was outstanding!  For my wedding reception, I decided to be a little unconventional and have it at a restaurant.   We had about 75 adults and rented out the upstairs dining area. I was very happy with how the dining area looked. My florist brought centerpieces and the Benjamin Prime staff set up the space to look like a reception hall.  Everyone was raving about the food and said this was one of the best wedding meals they've ever had.  Both the quality and quantity were superb.  Moreover, the value for the meal was very good and reasonable.  The service was impeccable, where the waiters were polished and on-point. The managers I worked with- Adam, Sean & Chris- were all very professional, personable, and very accommodating.  I am so happy and satisfied with how my wedding dinner reception went!  Actually, I think it's safe to say that ALL the guests were happy!  Many people were giving compliments about the dinner reception.  The parents' table told me they felt like they were royalty since the food was so grand.  As my wedding day approached, I started to have my doubts about not choosing the cookie-cutter wedding reception hall, but I'm so happy I didn't!  I wanted to make my guests feel special and important, but also wanted it to be classy.  Benjamin Prime achieved all of that and more!  Thank you!!",0,0,0,Amie K.,"Flushing, NY",1,5,0

That is the one thing I wasn't crazy about. It wasn't bad but it wasn't great either. I had the filet mignon and it was delicious. For sides we had- Brussels sprouts (so good!), asparagus, creamed spinach (I have never been a fan of this so can't say whether I would recommend or not) and potatoes.

Servers were attentive and the interior is quite nice. Definitely set up moreso for a lunch crowd, than fine dining. Both me and my mother started with the crab cake (supplement $5) it was well worth it. Filled with crab meat, accommodated by a horseradish sauce and mild red on a bed of red cabbage. For my entree I had the strip steak and my mother had the tuna pasta. The strip was a nice thin cut, extremely tender. A little underdone to my liking, but better under than over. The pasta was a nice portion, really great bolognese sauce to it with chunks of tuna throughout.

Putting that aside, I'd say this place is a totally fine Midtown steakhouse. If you said ""upscale Midtown Steakhouse"", I would imagine a place just like this. The food was good food. Not crazy, knock-your-socks-off good but totally fine. Steak was a little salty. But ""fine"", ""good"", or even ""very nice"".  I'd say totally go here if you're working nearby and you want to get steak with your co-workers, etc. The yelp ratings put this place on the top tier of all restaurants in New York and I really don't see that.

5.0,8/6/2018,"I went to Benjamin Steakhouse Prime for the NYC restaurant week lunch.I had been to Benjamin Steakhouse at 41 St. (inside of Dylan Hotel) with my friend and his family about 5 years ago. The restaurant was dark and cramped, we sat in the bar area for drinks, then we moved to the table. I remembered that we had Porterhouse for two and some side dishes. The meat was so delicious and so sizzling that it was quite an unusual experience for me. The meat tasted much better than the meat I tasted at Peter Luger Steakhouse (my Porterhouse at Peter Luger was burnt so badly, it turned completely black that I could not really taste anything but charcoal). At Benjamin Steakhouse, I had only one piece but it filled me up with a lasting memory. Later, I studied about its history, the restaurateur Benjamin Prelvukaj and chef Arturo McLeod (a Peter Luger's alumnus) started this Benjamin Steakhouse in 2006. Within a few short years, they secured its top echelon status among NYC steakhouses, with additional 4 more restaurants: Benjamin Steakhouse (41 St), Benjamin Steakhouse Prime (40 St), Benjamin Steakhouse (Hartsdale, Westchester), Benjamin Steakhouse (Japan) and The Sea Fire Grill (48 St). This time, only Benjamin's newer restaurant called Benjamin Steakhouse Prime (they are just one block away from the older one) had the NYC restaurant week menu. Benjamin Steakhouse Prime's ambiance was bright, with modern and chic in deco. The distances between the tables were comfortable and spacious. I tried restaurant week menu: First course was Jumbo Lump Crabcake. I think it was great, Jumbo and Lump was an accurate description of the dish. My second course was USDA Prime Junior New York Sirloin Steak with vegetable and potatoes. It was too big a meal for me, I had to take the half steak and side food home. All for $31.00, it was a fantastic deal, thanks to NYC restaurant week. Don't miss it.",1,0,1,Cao H.,"Scarsdale, NY",4,7,24

The ambience is perfect for any occasion, the wine and spirits list is endless prices are not scary that is you have visited other steakhouses of the caliber of this one.

3.0,7/16/2018,"Underwhelming. We went since my family really wanted to go to a steakhouse while in NYC and they remembered Benjamin from five years ago (I didn't- usually not a good sign). The place looks like someone just unpacked a room from the 70s. It's definitely clean and new but has a somewhat antique feel to it. Unless you like side looks from the staff you should dress up.Food is mediocre. The oysters and the lobster bisque were good. My family shared a dry aged steak for four - I didn't taste the dry age and was disappointed by the texture too. For a price of almost $55 per person for the steak only I would have expected more. Four sides are definitely enough for four persons. The lobster mac and cheese was average at best and kind of grainy. I was extremely disappointed by the onion rings - the onions were hard and almost raw-ish. The prime salad was underwhelming too, floppy greens and tasteless crab meat with no twist to it. Best part was definitely the dessert - I'd recommend the raspberry white choc mousse in a heartbeat.All in all an average steakhouse in a suit.",0,0,0,Marike J.,"Berlin, Germany",0,16,0

The staff I was in contact with were David, Shawn, and Adam and they all provided exceptional service. The quality of the food is just beyond. We ordered clams, shrimp cocktail, surf & turf, along with mushroom as our side. It was all so delicious and of course.. my favorite is their Benjamin sauce. I dip that sauce in my lobster and filet mignon and it was just divine. Overall, the quality of the food and service is beyond 5-star and I highly recommend for anyone looking for a really nice steak and seafood restaurant whilst in the city.

Especially really good ones and with so many to choose from in NYC, veering away from my usual go to's was tough but sometimes you just have to push yourself to get outta your comfort zone...and, well...sometimes you should stick the the tried and true.Bacon appetizer was good but Mastro's is better. When there's still some left on the plate and you're not shushing you had ordered more, there's a problem.Bread basket was cold. Mascarpone with truffle was a nice touch but it wasn't good enough to ask the bleh bread options in the basket.We ordered the Waygu New York strip.Friend enjoyed it but I didn't think it was good at all. It was chewy...and isn't waygu supposed to melt like butter? There was no melting action happening.  I found my pieces which were taken right from the center to taste and bite more like a hanger steak. So, yeah. Save some money and get a filet or rib eye instead.For sides, we were really happy with our cauliflower gratin.  This was prob the highlight of the entire meal.Was Benjamin Prime food? Eh. Yeah if it's the only other option to Sizzler. BUT, being in the same neighbors with Keen's, Mastro's, Del Frisco's, Del Monico's...(you get my point...) you have to step up your game.Waiter was friendly but seemed less attentive and somewhat irritated that we weren't splurging.

1.0,3/17/2018,"To put it simply, my girlfriend and I felt robbed after dining at Benjamin Prime tonight. The restaurant failed us on all accounts. Our waiter rushed us at every moment of our meal, even though the restaurant was 1/4 filled, this was an early pre-show dinner. The servers literally shoveled food onto our plates. The idea was to serve us but instead, they tilted the serving plates at an angle and pushed food into our plates...I was shocked.The food was supposed to be the highlight. We don't often dine at steakhouses but we were in the neighborhood and felt convinced by the 4.5 Yelp review, which is usually pretty accurate, not this time. The Caesar salad was equal to something you would get at a salad bar buffet, lettuce wasn't even close to fresh and it was caked in bottled dressing. The steak was absolutely horrible. It was served on a plate filled with what looked like cooking oil...which they called au jus sauce...not even close. The steak smelled horrible and didn't taste much better. The server highly recommended the porterhouse, massive mistake and rip off. I've never been to a chain steakhouse like Texas Roadhouse but I guarantee it's better than this. Bottom line, we felt sick to our stomachs the entire night and it essentially ruined what was supposed to be a special night on the town. On top of that, it wasn't cheap. It was in-line for what a NYC steakhouse costs but wasn't even close to being worth it. The food was low quality and prepared by what appeared to be an amateur chef. The service was sad and oblivious.We are more than willing to spend good money on a good dinner but this was unfortunately not even close to good and now we're sick to our stomaches.",0,0,0,Andrew P.,"New York, NY",0,38,0

I have been to a ton of steakhouses over the years and am an avid carnivore - the meal I ate at Benjamin Prime may be the best I've ever had in a restaurant.My wife and I came at 9PM on a Friday. The restaurant was about 2/3 full and the ambience was that of an old-school steak place. We were seated immediately after checking our coats and quickly given water. We ordered the following:* Grilled calamari* Italian burrata* Caesar salad* Porterhouse for 3 (medium rare)* Brussels sprouts* Molten chocolate cakeEvery single dish was prepared to perfection. The service was impeccable. Our waiter was Christian and he was outstanding from start to finish. The manager stopped by to make sure we were enjoying our meal and gave me a hug before we left (this is not a joke).

As soon as we walked in, we noticed it was definitely upscale. We were seated promptly. The server was very friendly and attentive, while also being humorous. Not some guy who hates his job. So we get down to it.For the appetizer, I got the grilled calamari. It came pretty quickly. As other reviews have stated, it's very delicious! It wasn't overly grilled to the point it was dry, definitely had great texture.For the entree, I ordered the 6oz sirloin. When it came, I was pleasantly surprised. It definitely was more than 6oz. It was perfectly cooked to medium rare like I asked. The steak had great taste and texture, did not require any additional sauce. Being a big eater, I wasn't exactly full but was satisfied.For dessert, I got the flourless chocolate cake. It was pretty good, not too sweet but still rich in chocolate flavor. Definitely paired well with the ice cream.Overall, this was a fantastic experience. Definitely on opposite end of the spectrum when compared with empire steakhouse in terms of experience and satisfaction. I'd say it's worth coming here still when it's not restaurant week but definitely a steal when it is.",1,0,2,Andrew C.,"New York, NY",217,161,250

The first thing that happened was when I went to check my coats in the worker gave me a rude face and snatched the coats and from then on I knew this was gonna be a bad experience. The service was extremely rude, unfriendly, and unhelpful. The food was expensive but that was expected but the food we got was horrible. The meat was burned from the outside and the inside was not even cooked. The worst thing was the safety hazards for example there was a candle with three balloons to it and the strings were barely above the flame. The second safety hazard was the waiter came out with knifes and had them facing out and almost cutting us.

The wedge was good although the dressing was a bit heavy handed but how can you turn down blue cheese? The fish was excellent, the lamb chops ok ( I just had lamb the previous night at Milos and wanted to compare - see review) but the steak..... wasn't anything of note in my opinion. The Brussels sprouts were the best item I ate and the cauliflower gratin was very good. To be honest - I kinda knew how the meal was going to go: upon arrival I asked about the coat check - rather than taking my coat I was directed up a ramp. I did not want to spend the time doing that and thought it a bit ridiculous. I noticed 70% of the restaurant had their coats on the back of their chairs. Service was gracious if a bit clumsy.

The grilled calamari was tender and flavorful. The Canadian bacon was super thick with the right portion of fat to meat. The steaks were the best we ever had in our lives and my husband has been to all the best steakhouses in NY. They were well-seasoned, big, and juicy. Every bite was a party in my mouth. I can not even begin to explain the service. It was on a whole other level. We were treated like royalty. We talked about the dinner and service all the way home.

The decor is amazing - quite dark as you would expect for a steak restaurant, but some light features, high ceilings and comfortable seating. The service was friendly throughout - a nice change from the traditional NY steakhouse service. I ordered the lobster bisque to start, the Rib eye for the main, plus fries, broccoli and creamed corn to share with my wife, who had the NY sirloin. Unfortunately the lobster bisque came out with my main - and while the waiter did apologise, it rendered the dish useless. Really frustrates me when simple stuff like this happens - especially at a restaurant where you are paying a premium. My steak was great, reasonably well cooked and nicely seasoned. The broccoli was also good but I wasn't that impressed by the creamed corn. One thing my wife appreciated was that they had peppercorn sauce - something she struggles to get in NY.

5.0,9/9/2017,"I came here for restaurant week lunch and was very impressed with the generous portion sizes (esp. for restaurant week). There's actually two Benjamin's restaurants one block apart which caused some comical confusion as we sat down at the wrong one and were handed menus before realizing our mistake, awkwardly shuffling out, and sauntering into the correct half of the building accessed from the next block down. Once we were in the right place, the food was excellent. I had a large Caesar salad for my appetizer, very nicely seasoned and replete with parmesan shavings to add a salty component. The entree was a very large fillet mignon cooked to perfection (med rare, obvi), and they really did not skimp on size or flavor. It came with a side of roasted potatoes and mixed vegetables, all very well seasoned and crispy. The dessert was a generous slice of New York style cheesecake, and it was honestly one of the best pieces of cheesecake I've had in years. They even offered us complimentary coffee and tea as well! The servers were all very nice, occasionally they gave me the food my friend ordered and vice versa, but it was busy and not a big deal at all.

5.0,7/19/2017,I had never been to Benjamin Prime Steak House before and I have always heard great reviews so one evening my two girl friends and I decided to make a reservation to check it out. It was a Thursday around 7:00 pm and you could tell they were very busy. The restaurant was packed and so we waited at the bar for our table. Anna Maria came over right away to greet us and get us started with some drinks. I didn't know what I was in the mood for so she came up with a custom cocktail just for me. It consisted of muddled blackberries and Jameson. It was delicious. She did the same for my friends. Her personality was so charming and was very pleasant to talk with and that we decided to cancel the reservation and continue at the bar. Anna Maria really strived to make our time at Benjamin Prime perfect despite the busyness. Since that evening I have gone back quite a few times to see Ana Maria at the bar.

5.0,7/7/2017,"I'm writing this while the flavors are still fresh in my mouth, while my stomach is still full, and while I am still smiling from a truly enjoyable meal and experience. This was one of those 'Top 5' meals that I'll speak of for years and use as my basis for recommending Benjamin Prime to colleagues, friends and family. The experience started with a bright welcome from the hostess, was nurtured by top-class, energetic service from our waiter, Gemci, and his assistants and was solidified by the manager and his warm handshake as we departed.I'm traveling with my elderly parents on this trip, so it's important to me that they are well cared for and enjoy themselves. I can usually predict how the evening will go in these situations within the first few minutes. I can also tell when we're being helped by consummate professionals, who know the difference their service can make to the overall enjoyment of the meal. Gemci is one of these professionals, who, with his supporting staff, anticipated our needs before we realized them and did everything with a smile and complete efficiency. I can't speak enough about how much of a difference this makes.And the food...wow! Notice that Benjamin Prime is listed as a steakhouse. These folks mean it. They know beef and can make one amazing steak! After the martini cocktail, I started my meal with a wedge salad. To me, this is a steakhouse 'must have.' I think it's because of the presentation and blue cheese dressing...it was delicious. Because I'm fond of juicy, marbled flavor in my steak, I usually choose a ribeye when it's on the menu. I don't know how large my steak was, but it filled my plate. It was cooked to a perfect medium rare and I enjoyed every bite. The menu is a la carte so I ordered a baked potato to accompany my steak. My parents chose the filet mignon and added some of the amazing creamless creamed spinach. They talked about their dinner as being the best steak they've had, from the moment we left the restaurant, into the cab, up the hotel elevator and will likely include it in the family Christmas card this December. I'd say they enjoyed their dinner, and I know I did.We ended our dinner by sharing some flourless chocolate cake with vanilla ice cream, and some crème brûlée (complimentary with a Yelp check-in.) Coffee was the perfect accompaniment to the rich desserts and helped us wind down this terrific dinner. Despite this being a Friday night, we never felt rushed, and never felt like we weren't the most important guests in the entire restaurant.

3.0,7/6/2017,After visiting Wolfgangs we were craving more meat in the city so @ 10:30 pm there are not many options so we did Bengamin's. What I can say is that it was good but not great. Bacon was awesome! Copy of Luger's sauce a+. Porterhouse for 2 missed the mark slightly. Wine - overpriced in comparison to other steakhouses for the same wines. Service was good but not shining. There was no music and we had to ask for it. If you know the 5th ave location the ceilings are high and while the place was not busy except for a few asian tourists enjoying their meat fix - music was really needed. In closing I would not return as their are many other steakhouses to choose from and this is just another copycat.,0,0,0,Allen S.,"Sarasota, FL",3,46,15

Having heard about this place from friends and colleagues, we decided to give it a try. Glad we did.    Stefano was our waiter and he was as gracious as he was attentive. Excellent service courteously given.I had the lobster bisque, my wife the baked clams, and my daughter the French onion soup. They rated theirs as excellent, but the bisque was the only disappointment of the evening. Too thin, scarce on the meat. To be fair, I am a lobster bisque fanatic, and not many restaurants live up to my expectations in that regard. The steaks, on the other hand, were three for three on the delicious scale. My wife and daughter shared the porterhouse for two. I had the bone in ribeye. Both were cooked to exact specifications (a real petpeave of mine when you are paying $55 for a steak) and both were hot when they arrived. That's important too, and another tip of the hat goes to the wait staff, who must keep an attentive eye on the kitchen in order to make it happen.

The bacon was very good but I don't think i would have been able to eat a whole one so i'm glad we shared. We got the porterhouse for two and it was very tasty. I feel like it could have had a bit more sear or crunch of the outside of the meat to give it more flavor. It was good but there was also a lot of fat in the meat as well.

5.0,3/21/2017,"FLAVORThe porterhouse packed a good dry-aged punch for 28-days. I've had stuff that was aged twice as long but didn't have half the flavor, so they're definitely doing something right here.That characteristic dry-aged beef aroma fills the room when the plates are coming to the table, and you can hear your steak before you see it, as they're served sizzling on hot plates in the traditional, old-school steakhouse style.While that serving method is generally not my cup of tea (I like a well rested steak and I worry about grey-banding on the edges), it is certainly done in the correct way here. The waiters don't just plop the steak onto the table, walk away and allow it to continue cooking to well done on that screaming-hot plate. No. They will immediately serve you the delicious, pre-sliced, medium-rare steak, unless you're an asshole who actually WANTS it to cook more on the plate.In any case, I loved this porterhouse, and now I need to come back to try the rib eye, which is my favorite cut of beef.Visit my site for the full review.",17,10,12,JohnnyPrimeC.

The room is large and elegant. We were greeted by a lovely hostess and Benjamin himself. From the very moment we got seated we were showered with attention. The service was impeccable. We started with the French onion soup with gruyere, organic mesclun salad and one portion of bacon. My bf was so so excited for me to try that bacon. I am so glad that he insisted on us getting it. I'm not a big fan of onion soup but this one was pretty special. We also got the grass fed porterhouse (t-bone) steak for two and shared winter mushrooms with truffle sauce and sweet whole small onions. The steak came well seasoned in a beautiful buttery juices. Our waiter skillfully cut it in front of us and plated a few pieces. The flavor, the smell, the color and the texture were fantastic!!! It was definitely the best steak I have tried so far but I don't eat red meat that often. The sides were great too. We definitely liked onions more than mushrooms. They were little tender and sweet. The sauce on mushrooms was too thick or too truffly. The only funny/pushy thing was that our waiter literally push my bf get a port at the end.

And I've been to all of them.We were a party of eleven, and had dinner in their private second floor wine room. It was an elegant dining experience, and the dinner, especially the prime aged steaks were cooked to perfection, charred crust, cut like butter and served HOT, a sticking point for our group. Our first course was a delicious individually served chilled shellfish platter, followed by a course of chopped salad, a perfect start for the porterhouse steaks to follow.We finished dinner with a selection of miniature fruit pastries, one better than the next, and was just right after our filing meal. But I would be remiss not to mention the superb service by the staff, we're a fun loving group of guys that enjoy laughing and joking around with one another, and occasionally the restaurant staff, for which they easily took in stride and even joined in on the laughter, making the evening even more enjoyable.

5.0,1/9/2017,"Beautiful location with excellent service and delicious food. My boyfriend and I both had the Lobster Bisque and the Ultra Wagyu New York Strip (rare) with creamy corn and mashed potatoes (with truffle oil) as sides. The lobster bisque was perfectly creamy with small pieces of lobster throughout the bisque. My boyfriend thought this was the best lobster bisque he's ever had, but I have to stay loyal to Nick's Lobster in Brooklyn; not as smooth, but larger pieces of lobster. Still, I would order it again.The Wagyu beef was perfectly cooked to an even rare. My boyfriend and I agree that this is the best Wagyu beef we've had and for the best value. However, he found it to be a little too salty. I prefer a well seasoned steak, so I thoroughly enjoyed the level of salt. It was a perfect piece of meat with a lot of fat marbling. As such, next time we will split it. It's too much for one person to eat. We came in hungry and left with no room for dessert. The sides were amazing. I don't usually care for the sides, but these were decadent and so delicious. Although, both, the meat and the sides, were decadent, it was the perfect meal. The potatoes were light and fluffy. The corn was slightly sweet and not too creamy. Surprisingly, we didn't feel like we needed anything light to cut the overall fattiness.Next time we will leave room for dessert, because their dessert menu looks amazing.

The hostess offered to transfer the reservation over and accommodate us and we gladly accepted. We checked out coats and were seated promptly. The restaurant is very beautiful. The appetizers page offer a lot more seafood options than the Benjamin's on 41st so Prime has them beat there. We decided on the porterhouse for 2 and it was by far the best I've ever had which means I no longer have to go to that place in Brooklyn to have my food slammed on the table by rude waiters if you know what I mean and I think you do. I digress. We had the creamless creamed spinach and winter mushrooms with truffle cream. Absolutely spectacular. Our waiter, Dylan, was very attentive without being overbearing and had a sparkling personality which only enhanced our dining experience. In fact, all of the staff was very friendly and professional. For dessert we had the crème brûlée and flourless chocolate cake with mint ice cream.

Definitely not as big as I thought, looked under 30oz, but still a great size for one hungry guy. Got it medium-rare and it was cooked perfectly. Both sides were great, but the filet half was perfectly melt in your mouth tender. The steak is served on its own plate, surrounded in juice, and the waiter will come and plate you some, and baste it with the juice if you want. The juice REALLY made the steak memorable. You could tell there was butter in there. It tasted a lot like delicious movie theater butter and it went perfectly on the steak. Price-wise, it's currently identical to what Peter Luger sells theirs for.I was pretty amazed to see my food fly out of the kitchen less than 10 minutes after I ordered.Last but not least, the complimentary Creme Brulee with yelp check-in.I was pretty surprised by how good this was. I typically don't even like creme brulee but this stuff was delicious. Spot onWas also happy to see they had salt and pepper on the table - so many restaurants don't even have these anymore. And they also have their own steak sauce on the table which kinda tasted a bit like cocktail sauce. Not really my thing but its there of you want it.Service was very attentive too. My waiter Genci had some perfect timing and was always around to make sure to plate and sauce a few steak pieces whenever I was running low, and he made sure I always had enough ketchup for my fries.I liked how the manager, Marie, herself also came over to make sure everything was up to par during the meal.Also, they take CREDIT CARDS.I think I would go back again",0,0,0,John Z.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",97,399,266
2.0,12/28/2016,"Ate here for Christmas. This was recommended by our hotel's concierge. Perhaps the other Benjamin's is outstanding, but we found the one at this location to be only average. Although we had reservations they tried to seat us in a place where one chair was in the middle of a walkway transversed by the waiters.  The ambiance was essentially a dining area fitted into the lobby of a small office building. For a pricy dinner it should and could be much better. We tried the fixed price menu, and it was OK. The shrimp appetizer and pear/apple desert were good. The rib eye was excellent, although one of our party found her steak to be extremely rare (she ordered it medium as did the rest of us). We found the seasoning rather salty. (Beware if you have to watch salt in your diet). The sides included corn, fries and broccoli. The corn was mushy and not very well cooked. The fries were surprisingly sliced potatoes with onions and while not what we expected, were tasty. The service was only average. The waiter acted as if he knew he was going to get large tips because of the cost of the dinner, and therefore really was indifferent to giving top notch service. We were offered refills of water at the end of the meal not while we were eating. I would say that in comparison to other steak places we've visited like the Capital Grille in Boston, this place was overpriced for what you're getting and nothing special.",2,1,0,Steve R.,"Boston, MA",0,14,54
5.0,12/27/2016,"I celebrated Christmas here and it was such a treat.  They offered a special Christmas menu with a glass of egg nog (alcoholic or non alcoholic) choices of appetizer (green salad with crab meat, lobster bisque and grilled jumbo shrimp), main course (Ribeye steak, rack of lamb or sea bass), a side (cream spinach, cream corn with gouda, mash potatoes, or fries)  and dessert (cheese cake, chocolate mousse or apple tart) and tea or coffee included.  I started with the salad with crab and it was meh ( a little limp although lightly dressed and tasteless), which made me a little worried about the rest of the meal. I dumped the balsamic vinegar and olive oil they provided for the bread into my salad and it improved.  Next up was the Ribeye steak done medium rare, which COMPLETELY redeemed this place; the steak is one of the best, juiciest, flavorsome, mouthwatering one I have ever tasted (compared with peers such as Wolfgangs, strip house, keens, bobby vans, peter lugars all of whom I do love) and I wasn't even that hungry. The cream spinach was divine and the perfect accompaniment to the steak.  I ordered a glass of Pinot Noir which made it all complete.  Whilst enjoying my steak and wine, I realized that they had not provided me with my egg nog, which prompted me to ask. I also noted the same happened with the table next to mine.  It is strange that the restaurant had to be prompted by the customer to ask for something that is included in the prix fixe. And so I had egg nog with my perfectly creamy cheesecake and a cup of tea. Beautiful space and overall attentive service.  All in, the spectacular steak and spinach made it a five star for me, whilst there is room for improvement in other aspects as noted.",0,0,0,Char K.,"Manhattan, NY",0,124,0

5.0,12/25/2016,"Benjamin Prime was recommended to us by our hotel concierge.  We wanted a nice dinner for Christmas Day.   We were seated as soon as we arrived (15 minutes before our reservation). Service was superb.  And Our meal was fabulous.  In addition to an a la Carte menu, they also offered a special prix fixe menu for Christmas with a choice of a rib eye bone in steak, Chilean sea bass or rack of lamb.   Our family ordered one of each.   Every entree came out cooked to perfection.  Delicious, flavorful, juicy.  Did not need steak sauce. It came perfectly seasoned.  Side dishes (mashed potatoes, creamed spinach and scalloped potatoes) were all a perfect compliment to the meal.  Delicious and not over salted.   We were all so full but we still had a dessert coming.   Flourless chocolate cake, apple pear tart and cheesecake.  All were delicious.  Would recommend this place in a heartbeat.  And yes, would return next time we are in NYC.

5.0,12/23/2016,So I've been to a lot of the famous spots in New York like Lugers and Keens and I can honestly say that the steak here is better than all of them.

5.0,12/22/2016,"We celebrated our 5th anniversary here and the evening exceeded our expectations. Upon arrival, we were promptly checked in and given a few options for seating. Complimentary champagne was provided and our waiter was pleasant and gracious all evening. He was very helpful walking us through some suggestions on the wine list. We ordered grilled shrimp to start and it was fantastic!! For entrees, I had the filet mignon and my boyfriend had the surf and turf filet with lobster and crab. We ordered broccoli and steak fries for sides and everything was cooked to order and was brought out in a timely manner. The creme brulee looked great but we ended up going with the cheesecake and were not disappointed. The raspberry sauce was perfect! We couldn't have asked for better service.

4.0,12/22/2016,"Cuisine: 9Service: 7Decor: 7Value: 8Overall: 8Sister restaurant to Benjamin's Steakhouse around the block and Seafire Grill a few streets away, Prime is like the middle child who is definitely more contemporary than the original, but not as stylish as the other sibling. In the end, the Benjamin restaurant group wanted to give their diners another choice to enjoy their steaks in the environment of their choosing. For me, Prime is not as beautiful as it can be with the overhanging portion of the restaurant being half the space, which takes away from the tall ceilings. With that said, it is still a great location for a carnivorous chow down.Two of us had a ""light"" dinner for a steakhouse by sharing two appetizers and one steak. The Strip Loin Tartar was excellent - dressed with a bit of salt, pepper, olive oil, and a slice of foie gras terrine on top. This is a fantastic dish done simplistically, yet packed full of flavor. The second appetizer was somewhat of a miss. For $23, I want my Grilled Sea Scallop on the Shell to be extremely large and whole. Instead, it was two medium scallops sliced into three or four pieces, and laid out on a shell. Btw, I had previously ordered the Grilled Calamari, which they had ran out by 8pm.Let's talk about what we came here for - the steak. We selected the Ribeye done medium rare for the night and it was spectacular. Perfectly cooked, it was juicy, flavorful, tender, decadent ... ... the superlatives can go on forever. One of the best steaks I have had in recent memory. This piece of gorgeous meat alone will draw me back for another visit.Lastly, we checked in using Yelp and received a free Creme Brûlée. When the waiter mistakenly brought us a NY Cheesecake, we ended up with two desserts. There goes our ""light"" dinner. Another knock on the waiter was that he didn't know where the west coast oysters were from. However, he was very friendly and I can easily let the lack of knowledge issue go.Bottom line, I will be back for another yummy steak soon.",3,0,0,Gordon Y.,"Rego Park, NY",562,237,1376

5.0,12/10/2016,"Just when you thought you discovered the best place for steak in NY, there comes Prime.  Another fabulous creation from Ben and his team!  It is a combination of the old world charm of the steakhouse nearby and the Seafire Grill a few blocks North.  And the combination works.We were seated in an elevated area overlooking the main area and to the right of the bar, so we had a great spot and a lovely view of the comings and goings at the restaurant...and it was busy.The staff were as welcoming as can be and the service was again at the impeccable standards that one has come to expect from this group.  Victor is managing here and is putting his high service mark on this spot as he has the others.The menu is extensive and we settled on a couple of salads and the colossal shrimp to start.  Fresh ingredients and the most firm and succulent shrimp as always! Entrees were the fillet and the NY strip bot at the medium rare levels.  Perfection.  The fillet was succulent and was cut very thick - I was surprised they were able to get it cooked so perfectly!  The strip was the best, as it has always been!!!  Loved it.  Some greens on the side to balance things out made for a perfect evening.  Wow...this is a must visit for the steak and fish lover, not to mention those who love the finer things  in life.",3,0,1,Marios D.,"Manhattan, NY",196,509,822
5.0,12/10/2016,"As far as steakhouses in NYC go, I have always been a Wolfgang's fan!  However, a friend of mine suggested we visit a new one in Midtown.  Benjamin Prime was a very impressive space to say the least....clearly was going to be a contender on the ""environment"" front.  We were seated at a nice generous table for two in the middle of the dining room.  We were greeted by a very friendly fresh-faced waiter named, Granit (as he says, ""It's Granite without the E"") we loved him from the start.  Granit pointed out some of the menu's favorite choices and he was spot on.  The grilled oysters were to die for, and I've felt that they could not have gotten any better than New Orleans, but I was proven wrong!!  The menu IMO, was broader than most steakhouses and I greatly appreciated this.  Their options made it hard to choose!  We went on to order the Filet and a baked stuffed lobster (that they shelled for us).  Just delicious!  Their wine list was quite impressive and I'm sure, if not already, will be among a Wine Spectator's award recipient.  Jason, the Somm was very helpful, and like Granit, was very friendly and not intimidating (an attribute that I think is key in a Somm).  Service can make or break a restaurant even if its totally on par....but I think the service here is what set Benjamin Prime apart from what's become standardized steakhouse service.  We will undoubtedly be back!    And did I mention that's insanely close to Grand Central....this place is a WIN WIN!!",3,1,0,Barbara S.,"Larchmont, NY",2,2,0

4.0,11/11/2016,"I came here for a company event, so we ordered off a prix-fixe menu with choices for appetizers and mains. I chose a crab cake as my appetizer, which was the size of a softball and full of crab meat (none of that breadcrumb nonsense tyvm). Second course was a seafood platter for the table, and included some of the biggest shrimp I'd ever seen in my life. Other items on the platter were lobster (decent, not great), oysters (I think they were Kumamotos - so good!), and clams.My table decided to go family style on the 4 options for the main course:- Porterhouse for 2: Filet side was super tender, but the other side was a bit stringy/gristly. Overall a pretty good steak, but not the best I've had. Cooked on the medium side of medium rare, I actually prefer this to Luger's strategy of just giving it to you more rare and hoping it cooks on the hot plate.- Lamb chops: So very good. Super tender, just cooked perfectly.- Halibut: I thought this was a little overcooked, but nothing egregious. Squeeze of lemon made it a perfect lighter dish to offset everything else.- Risotto: Hard pass. Rice was so undercooked, and there wasn't really any flavor.Dessert was a platter of petit fours including mini lemon tarts, apple pies, macarons, brownies, mousse cakes, an eclair, a cream puff....just overall an insane amount of food.Drinks were strong and well prepared and service was very attentive throughout the night.",5,2,1,Yuting Z.,"Manhattan, NY",435,332,543
