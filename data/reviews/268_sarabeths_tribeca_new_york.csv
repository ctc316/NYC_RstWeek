1.0,4/24/2019,"Beware - if you have a MealPal plan and you miss the pick up window period, you will not be able to pick up your meal.  I was running late today for more than an hour and called to see if I could still pick up my lunch and was told no.  I have had other MealPal providers be more flexible with being late for pick up periods and never had issues.  So disappointing - I will not be ordering from Sarabeth's again! They just lost a customer.  If I could give you zero stars I would.",0,0,0,cindy c.,"Manhattan, NY",0,8,0
5.0,4/21/2019,The family came here for Easter brunch. The service was great. And so was the food. We were immediately seated even before our reservation. I had the morning crunch. It was perfect. Not too much. My wife had the Lemon pancakes. Big portion. She could not finish it. This place is highly recommended. And recommend a reservation.,0,0,0,Rich G.,"St Joseph, MI",6,12,3

5.0,3/28/2019,"I really love this place. The location is a few minutes' walk from One World Observatory which happened to be my stop after fueling up with a yummy breakfast here. I opted for the TriBeCa Breakfast since I like to have salty and sweet:  (fluffy) scrambled eggs, double bacon (it comes with sausage but I prefer bacon), two pancakes and wheat toast (or your choice of muffin, croissant or scone). It's *a lot* of food so I took my time devouring it especially knowing this would keep me going until dinner (and it did!). I realize there are other locations throughout the city that were closer to my hotel (like the one near Central Park) but chose this location because of its more casual feel. Bonus was that I was here mid-morning in the middle of the week with less than a dozen other patrons which made for a nice, quiet meal before heading out to the bustling busyness of the streets outside. This was on my list to revisit (I'd been once before a few years ago) and I can honestly say it's my favorite NY place for brunch.",0,0,0,Andrea S.,"Atlanta, GA",1,32,33

2.0,3/3/2019,"Very disappointing  We looked at the decor, menu, and prices and thought the meal was going to be pretty high quality. Our food and coffee were both surprisingly lukewarm. The cheese in the omelette was good, but the ham was the type of tiny cube ham I would expect to find in a cheap diner. We didn't really enjoy our meals or the experience.

3.0,2/23/2019,"Unless you have small children, skip it. I'll start with the positives: cute decour, lots of tables and space. Also there were some really great staff working there, who were nice enough to accommodate us after my family was really late for our reservation. So the downsides... I cut my leg on the underside of the bar area. When I said cut, I mean it was small, but it was bleeding and it ripped my tights. None of the bartenders seemed all concerned Even after I explained myself and showed them my leg. I had to ask for a Band-Aid about three or four times before I finally got one, and no one offered to comp anything or accommodate me in any way. We sat down and ordered our brunch from a very lovely waitress; but when our food came, my specialty breakfast pizza had all sorts of additional toppings on it that were not mentioned on the menu. However, since we'd been waiting almost 20 minutes, and a new order would take 15 minutes, I tried to get through it I just picking off these extras. Suffice to say it did not go well, and I was extremely unimpressed. Generally, others at the table felt the same about what they got - lukewarm pancakes, ham parading as Canadian bacon, waiting on drinks that were ordered but never came. With so many great restaurants in New York, you can definitely go elsewhere.",0,0,0,Andrea P.,"Brooklyn, NY",15,128,250
3.0,2/16/2019,"This rating could be better...I sat down to have dinner and here are some of the things that went wrong that can be improved upon:- Wine bottle: please use a chilled wine bucket - Service : I was waiting to add to my order for a good 20 min. I think they thought I just wanted HH but was waiting to order my entree. Might have been a mistep in service transition. It was not notified .- WC: no toilet paper . I had to quickly run and grab paper towel . Shocked. - also the restaurant was probably 25% at capacity (a generous round-off) - bartender took my dessert order. Maybe short- staffed but the gesture added a star to this review .- food was good, not great. Skip the lobster roll. It was scraps of meat with a big, stale brioche wrapped around it .Considering that this establishment is not known as a cheap establishment, my expectations where set at a higher standard.",0,0,0,Audrey B.,"West Village, Manhattan, NY",92,31,12
3.0,1/19/2019,"Ugh. I used to love, love Sarabeth's, especially the one on the upper west side. I loved getting up on a Sunday morning, grabbing the New York Times, and heading over for a chill breakfast with my then boyfriend, or meeting up with friends before heading off for shopping or Central Park. Sarabeth's was the place that you could get the perfect Sunday brunch, even if it meant waiting for a bit (you know, before Yelp, social media and all the apps that let you make a reservation, etc ...), by yourself, with your honey, with your parents or with friends. It was the perfect place for all occasions, breakfast, lunch or dinner.But, that was 22 years ago when I first came back to the city. Nowadays, it's the place that people still go because of what Sarabeth's used to be, and less about what it's become, which is a trendy-ish relic that banks on its stellar rep of long ago, and doesn't put all that much attention into the rest of things anymore. (Sadly, the same is true of its sister restaurant Jane, where we ate the day before. See my review there.)Don't get me wrong. The food was mostly great. My omelette was near perfect. And Jayson's ricotta pancakes (the main reason we chose SB's) were oh so delicious. But ... we brought our friend Michael, who is also Jayson's BFF. They went to culinary school together. And, it was a serious let down.For starters, the service was almost non-existent. I had to get up three separate times to find a waiter who would glance our way for refills on water/coffee/juice, to get condiments and for the check. We waited forever to get service, and after we took our order, we never saw any person come to our table unless we chased after them. It was highly annoying.Michael is very particular about his food. He specifically asked for his omelette to not have any burnt or brown marks. He wanted it very light and fluffy. The waiter assured him that it would come out as he requested. And, of course, it came out with brown and burnt marks. But, because we couldn't find the waiter, he unhappily ate it. We didn't want to be there all day.The prices are reasonable (if you get your food right and the service was good.) But, for what we got, and the lack of service, it just wasn't anything special or exceptional. It really could have been any restaurant. After three decades, you'd think they'd want to keep the same standard of excellence they once were known for, instead of just shortchanging people by giving them less.",2,0,0,J.

3.0,1/6/2019,Coming into Sarabeth's today was an enjoyable experience. As soon as we walked in it was very apparent that this location was the largest one I have had brunch at. It was very busy and luckily we scheduled a reservation because a party of 4 came in after we were greeted and they were told that the wait time was almost an hour. Wow. I can believe it though. Now for the food. I ordered the traditional eggs benedict and a kids portion of the lemon ricotta pancakes. Both Michael and Jeffrey ordered the farmers omelette. For the table we ordered the pork apricot sausage and bacon. All of us had coffee and sparkling water. My eggs benedict were ok. The muffin honestly was very think so I opted to just eat the poached eggs. The pancakes were absolutely amazing. Lemon ricotta pancakes are my absolute favorite breakfast item to have. Both Jeffrey and Michael said that their omelettes were decent. Although Michael specifically told our waiter Armando that he wanted the eggs to be soft and not brown. They did come out with browning on the edges. Michael was annoyed but Armando never really came back to check on if we liked or disliked the food. Sausage was very good. The coffee was ok. But I do have an issue with the sparkling water. Why would they charge $3 per person for sparkling water The was a) not very sparkling and b) more like club soda? The experience would have been better had we been checked on though.,0,0,0,Jayson C.,"New York, NY",1039,247,1210

2.0,12/29/2018,"I've been to the Sarabeth's near Times Square but that was just for drinks and light food. While with several friends in Tribeca we thought we would try this location out. I have heard not the best reviews of Sarabeth's Tribeca but my friend just got out of work nearby and we figured it was convenient and close so we gave it a try. The restaurant was busy and the tables are really close to each other. The first sign of trouble was the indifference of the staff, its as if they are just going through the motions rather than trying to enhance a dining experience. I guess you don't come here for the service.As there were several of us we sampled different menu items. The Margherita pizza has to rank among New York's worst and New York has a lot of bad pizza so that's saying a lot. The pastas were almost as bad as the pizza. Tasteless orecchiette and drab lump crab spaghetti failed to impress.This restaurant seemed to have a tourist mentality where they serve people who won't be coming back.

2.0,12/4/2018,"Honestly, 2 stars is about as best as it can get... The non attentive service makes the over priced items feel really over priced. While the menu looks good, the execution could certainly use a lot more work. If I paid half of what I did for the meal I got, I'd still think it would be considered on the high side. The setting is decent and the have a full bar, the few plus' I can think of. Probably wouldn't make my way back here for a 2nd visit. Greasy chips... grill cheese on a roll that's not even cheesy?? Full, but not satisfied is the best way I can put it... flushing money down the toilet.

Sarabeth's has multiple locations such as Central Park South, Park Avenue South, Upper East Side, and Upper West Side. Immediately upon arriving, the inside of the restaurant was very tidy and the staff was amicable. We thought we'd have to wait for a long time to be sat down but we actually got sat down right away. It was 5 of us, myself included, and we got sat in circular table which was nice. We didn't have to scream at each other from across the table to be heard.

Our waitress (Natalie) was incredibly rude (we literally watched her point at our table and scoff / throw her hands in the air when speaking to other employees). She then offered ""drinks on the house"" as a consolation, which took an additional 20 minutes to come to our table. We spoke to the manager who was incredibly apathetic.

It has a very nice look to it. The wait staff was very attentive when we first arrived but as it got busier, we seem to have gotten ""lost"".The menu was average and we were underwhelmed with the food.

Sarabeth's is a restaurant where you can enjoy good food and good conversation without having to worry about the bass in the music. I went to Sarabeth's with my mom during a Friday lunch. The waitress greeted us with a smile and proceeded to sit us outside. I ordered the Salmon eggs benedict with orange juice. My mother ordered the Buttermilk pancakes with strawberries. The portions of the pancakes were well worth the price. The eggs benedict were on the salty side and I needed my orange juice to be refilled. The service was decent.

The bartender was friendly and even offered to let us charge our phones and volunteered to give us a mini photo shoot lol. This location has more of a relaxed French bistro vibe than the Park Ave South location (which is a bit more stuffy and for the corporate set). For drinks, we had Kir Royales (yum) and an Aperol Spritz (my first time finally trying it. Was ok - prob not for me). We ordered some bar snacks since we had dinner later on.  The truffle French fries hit the spot (but ketchup was a little weird - I love Heinz and nothing else..right Drake?).  Shrimp cocktails were also on deck - giant and tasty (main reason why I love their happy hour). The crab hummus dip was interesting (didn't have the crab or cheese taste the menu promised) and felt more like warmed up hummus with some bay seasoning. The pita seemed like it was microwaved up (but I was a bit hungry and we devoured it). Definitely come for the happy hour which is nice after walking around the area / checking out the water. This is a quieter area than SOHO which we walked from and great to relax and unwind without feeling rushed. PLUS, happy hour on a Sat isn't as easy to find as you think.

2.0,6/21/2018,"I was so excited that I was gonna give a try to this location. But I am really disappointed with this visit. It was Thursday morning me and my uncle went there for breakfast. He got the cheese omelette with pumpkin muffin and I got the lemon ricotta pancakes. The pancakes were ok to taste but nothing really extraordinary but his omelette was lack of cheese and just an omelette you can easily have same taste or better at any IHOP. The portion was also small and the only side was the muffin. No hash browns or salad. Ok what's sometimes more important than food is service. Because sometimes you forgot about the taste of food if you are welcomed and served nicely. Our server was a young lady (long black hair ,)don't know her name. Oh I see her name on our check : Natalie!She was not attentive at all. She hardly came to the table to refill my coffee and she never stopped by to ask about how satisfied we were with our food. Maybe if she did so my uncle was ready to send his omelette back and order something else. The Bussers were really nice and they were visiting our table more than her.  I don't know why she was like this and she was not really busy at all to understand her. My uncle was waving his credit card to make the payment but she was never attending our desire to pay the bill. Finally we have the credit card to a busser and then I saw that he gave the credit card to her and she charged and brought the bill. I will attach the receipt. Anyway ,this was really a bad experience and won't be back here again. Maybe the other locations of Sarabeth's.",0,0,0,Oznur B.,"Northwest Washington, Washington, DC",2,94,149

4.0,6/16/2018,"TLDR: great happy hour deal every day from 4:30pm to 7:30pm; delicious cocktails and snacksAlthough I'm not a huge fan of Sarabeth's for dinner, decided to give it a try again due to its great happy hour deal. A coworker and I went on a Tuesday around 6:45pm. While it was kind of busy, the restaurant is pretty large, so we were seated immediately.The happy hour deal consists of $7 select wines and cocktails, half price draft / bottled beer, and discounted bar snacks (clams, oysters, shrimp cocktail, and margherita pizza). I personally think the selection of the discounted bar snacks aren't that great (so we ended up ordering from the regular bar bites menu), but it's hard to beat the drinks deal, especially compared to standard NYC prices.My coworker and I ended up ordering two rounds of drinks. I got the carribean mule (Captain Morgan spiced rum, ginger beer, lime) and my coworker got a glass of malbec. The happy hour menu has four different types of white wine, a rose, three different types of red wine, six types of cocktails (including a ""create your own mule""), five types of draft beer, and six types of bottled / canned beer. I enjoyed my drink and was happy with the wide selection on the happy hour menu.For bar snacks, we ended up ordering the guacamole & chips ($14.50) and shrimp poppers ($12.25). Both were well-portioned and delicious.If you work in Tribeca or FiDi, Sarabeth's is a great spot to grab a $7 glass of wine, $7 cocktail, or $4 beer during happy hour.",3,1,2,Amanda W.,"London, United Kingdom",242,96,259

They should add more clams & linguine to the dish and make it more flavorful. Scallops were very good quality. Also ordered a side of Brussels sprouts and they were also very bland and super oily.

5.0,2/5/2018,"I first discovered Sarabeth's around three years ago and it is still one of my favorite brunch spots in the city! When I think of classic American brunch staples, this is the first name that comes to my mind. There are several locations but this is the one I have frequented the most. It is situated downtown, right by the water, in a neighborhood lined with trees and cobblestone paths. The decor is simple and elegant, with high ceilings and relatively spacious dining rooms.Whenever I come, I always order the pancakes - they are light and fluffy, and will definitely satisfy that breakfast food craving. Another standout item was the lobster cobb salad - the seafood was super fresh and the ingredients came together in beautiful harmony. Not sure if the chicken and waffles was a limited time special because I don't see it on their menu online anymore - however, I still wanted to mention it because it tasted amazing! The skin was crispy yet didn't feel greasy at all. More recently I tried the braised short rib hash and it not disappoint either. The sunny side up eggs served on top were perfectly runny without being too raw. The golden yolk seeped into the potatoes and short rib and added amazing richness.

We sat in the back room with no other guests, so there were perhaps 40 empty chairs around our table. A huge con? None, really. But the food is predictable.

Our group was not rushed, and we were able to enjoy our meals (well some of us.)The orange juice as our waitress explained is cold pressed - not hand squeezed in the kitchen but made at an offsite location and delivered in the morning. Myself and Ginger both ordered the orange juice and sent them both back. It tasted no different than a glass of boxed Tropicana.  Our waitress suggested we try the Four Flowers Juice, which is made fresh on site everyday.  The juice was epic-simply rich and delicious.  The pumpkin waffles were delicious, perfect brunch choice especially durning the winter months and holidays. I ordered the Short Braised Rib Hash, which was forgettable.   Other members of our party ordered the Apple Cinnamon French Toast - basic. Salmon Benedict, and the Framer's Omelette. Still everything was pretty much pedestrian.

She switched to the other chair but that one was blocking the waiter's access to a smaller table behind us...there was no winning in this situation.It continued to be awful because the restaurant was freezing and they left the door propped open???It peaked when we were surrounded by three screaming babies, one of which kept throwing her mom's iPhone on the floor and at nearby customers. Why the baby had the iPhone in the first place is beyond me. Yes, this is a very cute, hip, popular, well-known brunch place but you have a child now...grow up and either leave it at home or accept that you are not 23 anymore and you cannot come to brunch with your gal pals every Saturday.Finally, I wish the waiters would calm the fuck down with the plate clearing.

The lobster roll is easily one of the worst I've had. Anyone down for an arugula roll? The lobster roll consisted of stale bread and a huge bed of arugula inside with lobster placed on top. The lobster was also mixed with tomatoes.. the heck? The amount of lobster given is a disgrace and probably enough to fit into a lobster SLIDER. Eggs Benedict with Canadian bacon was also not a hit. Canadian bacon was soggy, hollandaise sauce had no taste, and the bread was also super stale. I have to agree with a fellow yelper; IHOP tastes better.",0,0,0,Kitty W.,"Forest Hills, NY",290,355,590

3.0,9/3/2017,"Honestly I was expecting soooooo much more based on the reviews. I had a quick trip to NYC and wanted this to be my last meal there. Stopped in for brunch before the airport. Plus side was that we were seated very quickly. The atmosphere was great and the vibe fed my soul. I was ready for the experience. The table not far from us informed their waitress that it was their first visit and she was super nice and informative to them. She made recommendations and pointed at other meals as they passed by... stellar service. Our service on the other hand, not so much. I informed our waitress that it was our first visit and I was returned with a blank stare. She asked for our order three times as I continued to tell her that we needed additional time. She exhaled loudly as she walked away irritated. This is was killing my vibe. When she returned and we placed our order my brunch partner had a few questions, she was returned with very snark black or white responses. All in all, or service was horrible. I started my meal with the avocado toast which was just ok. One of my eggs had no yolk and the egg texture was more like cottage cheese. It was quite off putting, but the other was cooked perfectly and tasted amazing. I'm not sure if it was a fluke. I also had the adult grilled cheese with tomato soup. This was phenomenal! They didn't mention the pretzel bun but ohhh yeah that was a thing and it made the meal worth it. So my main course made up for the poor service. I got my bill and paid in cash. I was supposed to have $18 change returned to me. The horrible waitress kept it. I didn't tell her to, she took it upon herself to think that was her tip. My dining partner and I paid separately so she was tipping as well. So for your poor service you believe that a $25 tip was appropriate for a meal that didn't exceeds $60. That was where I drew the line. Also she never told me her name. I asked 3 times and she never told me. Needless to say I have a few lessons learned here: don't sit in her section, don't pay cash, and do get the grilled cheese!",3,1,1,Latrina R.,"Baton Rouge, LA",132,96,229

I can't believe that it was difficult to get reservations here and I would suggest anyone looking at Sarabeth's to consider all the many other better brunch options in the city. Service wasn't too great either. Our server looked and acted like she couldn't care less and we barely saw her. At $15-20 per plate for brunch, I expected way more. The Tribeca breakfast was decent but $22 for 2 mediocre pancakes, 2 pieces of bacon, a piece of sausage, and 2 eggs... is ridiculous even for NYC. The salmon benedict looked okay but friends didn't make it seem like they it was anything to rave about.

3.0,8/11/2017,This review is for dinner. I haven't had breakfast or lunch here but I suspect it's better. Appetizer was grilled octopus. It was tender and flavorful although there was too much mayonnaise and the fennel was too sour. The sea scallops and clam pasta was totally not worth it. It probably contained the least amount of pasta that I've ever had for a pasta dish. And it was lacking in salt. There were 3 scallops and 3 clams. For 26 dollars it was a complete rip as half the dish was just veggies. The crab spaghetti was ok. If you like savory then you might like this dish. I don't really love or miss dishes sweet though.

The crab cakes had virtually no taste and mushy texture. The homemade potato chips were stale. The fruit salad consisted of canned pre-skinned oranges and grapefruit from the food service giant distributor Sysco (this was during the middle of summer, the peak of cantaloupe and honeydew melon season). Yet, not a single piece of local fruit or melon, but cheap canned distributor fare.  The salad was tasteless and uninspired.  The harried server had no time or interest in finding out how our food tasted or attending to diners.

My friend and I came in around lunch time and were very impressed with the interior design. The place truly has so much potential, but the rest of the experience was horribly underwhelming. There were more flies than should be in a restaurant, my burger was quite small with a very cheap, bad-tasting bun (it was dry and flavorless). The guacamole serving it came with was very small for the price... trust me, I work at a restaurant, and we make our guacamole fresh, and a serving twice the size would be almost half the price! The turkey burger itself just really lacked significant flavor. My friend's hash was probably the worst part of the meal. I found it gross, he found it tolerable.

The bussers were very attentive and kept our waters full and our tables clear. As for the food, I always try to get something that I know I can't make at home and that is valuable in price. At this place, I couldn't find anything. A simple cheese omelet was rather expensive at 16 dollars so I found myself getting nothing.

Our server took our order as soon as we sat down. Luckily he brought out our drinks very quickly and offered recommendations at my request. Once he delivered our coffee, we never saw him again. We waited a while for our food, we waited some more, and some more. After nearly an hour, my friend and I realized that there was something wrong. The two other parties that had been seated next to us AFTER we arrived had already gotten their food and FINISHED it. I waved down a waiter (because ours went missing) and asked if there was a problem. He looked quite nervous so I asked if the order had even been placed.  He ran inside to ""check"". Clearly our order had never been placed with the kitchen. When the food did arrive, my omelette was under cooked, and there was absolutely no presentation to the plate whatsoever. More time passes by, then more. Finally I flag down the waiter again and asked for the check along with another coffee.  The coffee never came, neither did the bill.  Once flagged down AGAIN, he again seemed nervous and ran inside to get the coffee and bill. Our original waiter must have been sucked into the Bermuda Triangle because he literally disappeared.This morning I attempted to call the restaurant and speak with the manager.

4.0,3/15/2017,"I visited Sarabeths Tribeca a couple days a go as I embarked on my week-long journey In New York City. Over the past few days as I reflect on all the wonderful places I saw and foods I was able to try in New York, I would have to say I was most pleased by my experience at Sarabeths Tribeca. My experience at this restaurant was incomparable to any other local restaurant I tried in New York City. Sarabeths Tribeca is filled with beautiful décor, a warm and inviting atmosphere and the people who are determined to make your visits memorable. The food here is eloquently prepared to your liking and if you are planning to be in the area of this wonderful restaurant, I highly encourage you to visit. The dishes available at Sarabeths Tribeca have their own twist on what ""American Food"" should taste like. Their menu consists of fresh egg omeletts, Steel Cut oats and Granola, Sandwhiches, pastas and even muffins with legendary preservatives. Everything on the menu is absolutely delicious. On my visit my friends and I tasted all our meals and I was tempted to order one of everything on the menu ranging from breakfast to dinner. On my visit I ordered the ""Lumberjack Breakfast"" and it came with buttermilk pancakes, bacon, grilled sausage, potatoes and toast with preservatives. The food is worth every dollar. It is by far one of the best meals I have ever eaten in my entire life. You think im being a bit dramtic on my take on their pancakes? I beg to differ! The pancakes are cooked perfectly- they were light and were topped with warm butter. The eggs tasted like ""real"" eggs that were a few minutes cracked open and salted to perfection. The bread was prepared by their bakers, and my slices were fresh, light and mouthwatering. The potatoes were cut into tiny squares and were served with onions and small peppers that give it a fresh and spicy taste. Last but not least, the preservatives were rich and fruity, and you were able to make out what fruit you were tasting. Although it sounds like a heavy breakfast, it satisfies every catergory from protein, grains and even fats and was not overwhelming. It was a breakfast experience like no other- and defintely nothing compared to what restaurants in Arizona have to offer. In regards to pricing, it is no surprise that everything on the menu is over $10, but like I said previously- it is worth every bit. I spend a little under $40 on my bill and although it sounds ridicously expensive, I left satisfied and couldn't stop thinking about my two hot cups of Hot Chocolate make from Ghiraradelli Chocolate. You know that saying- ""you get what you pay for""? This is one of those instanes.  The service I received at Sarabeths was outstanding. As soon as my party of four stepped through the door we were instantly greeted and sat. We waited no longer than a minute to be sat and it didn't feel rushed. In fact the service felt genuine and the workers wanted you to enjoy this experience. My waiter and I ironically shared names and she was amazing. Natalie, my waiter was a very pleasant woman and was not shy to get to know my party and I. She constantly checked to see if we needed anything, but was not annoying. She brought our food in a timely manner and we never ran out of complimentary water, napkins or silverware. Everything we needed to enjoy our breakfast was already provided and only inches away in convinience. Last but not least I want to inform you of the atmosphere. At the beginning of this review I mentioned the place being welcoming and inviting, and couldn't think of better terms to describe the location. In the center of the restaurant is their bar, where there is many drinks and beautiful cherry blossom flowers hanging in front of their mirrors. Surrounding their bar are beautiful wooden tables that are spaced out for privacy and comfort. My party and I sat at a half booth and the seating was very comfortable and clean. Usually when I go to a restaurant I have to wipe my chair or clean my space where I'll be enjoying my meal, but at Sarabeth's that was not the case. Besides the tables, all the fixtures were white and the décor complimented the color very well. It was classy and the waiters and servers set the mood by wearing ironed white shirts and clean black aprons. My only complain would be the bathroom. It was very messy and unsanitary and I truly felt uncomfortable to be in the small space. In fact, I couldn't even wash my hands in one of their facilities and had to search for another ladies room. I wish their facilities were cleaner and taken care of properly like the rest of the restaurant. I give Sarabeth's Tribeca 4.5 stars for their inviting attitude and memorable eats. Unfortunately I had no left-overs to take home, and wish we had this upscale restaurant available in Arizona. It was an amazing experience and if you are in New York I highly recommend you to visit to eat the best food you'll ever taste in your life.",1,0,1,Nataly B.,"Phoenix, AZ",0,3,0

($18+ for French toast seems a bit steep to me, even in New York.) Also, the service left something to be desired. We got seated right away, but then halfway through our meal they came and tried to take our plates even though we were both still eating. Then, when we were actually done, it took over 20 minutes to flag down our waitress and get the check.

I waited for 35 minutes, noticing many people leave and assuming the empty tables were for reservations. However when I noticed three couples come in, say they were reservation-less and get seated immediately. I asked to speak with the manager and shared my experience; if you're not able to seat a single person at a tabletop, just tell me right away. I was told it was an ""oversight"" (but my name is right there on the wait list!) and could be seated right away. Note the manager didn't apologise, wasn't even surprised.

The service and food varies - I had great experience with the staff, who is very quick with our orders and checked up on us. On another occasion, we had a large group and the staff was mia. We waited 30 mins to be served with our drinks which was ridiculous. Note: sitting in the front near the entrance seems to garner faster service.As for the food, I found my culinary experience to be above average. The brunch entrees aren't overly mouth watering delicious, except for the waffles and french toasts.I had a bad experience where based on a waiter's recommendation, I ordered the chicken sausage and kale omelette. I took one bite and the eggs were so runny, like slimey mixed with bits of chicken sausage. I politely asked the waiter to take it back and I ordered another entrees. I'm used to fluffy or solid omelette. It took the kitchen 20 minutes to whip up another item. Meanwhile the restaurant is half empty.

But for how expensive it is, the food falls short. In regards to brunch/lunch I mean. I've tried the pancakes, the omelettes, the French toast, the granola and the pastries. Each time I've ordered the pancakes they were out of the advertised fruits that accompany them. Each time I've ordered the omelette they have left out some ingredient that is advertised on the menu, like ham, or the cheese. And sadly, the stemware and silverware has been dirty several times.

2.0,10/30/2016,"This restaurant is akin to the beautiful goddess you spot eyeing you at the bar, who later proves to be as bland and disappointing in personality as she is in bed. Everything from the sleek décor to the classic menu to the colorful plating draws you in, only to hit you over the head with unimaginative tastes and below par fundamentals. We were very excited to try out a spot in Tribeca since we never make it this far into the desert of Manhattan. Sarabeth's, albeit half-full, was charming in appearance with many windows throughout the restaurant and a stylish theme of white and wood colors. But our opinion was first curved when an unenthusiastic, bored hostess took us to our seats. From then on, although the service was acceptable, the food went south. My Spinach and Goat Cheese Omelet dish came out luke-warm, runny, with somehow watery insides. My boyfriend's sausage was cold. My croissant was not something I would pay over $1 for at Costco. And like the beautiful girl who has absolutely nothing going on other than her looks, the fruit salad was pathetic. Gorgeous in appearance - with sliced bananas rounding a bowl with strawberries placed in the middle. But hidden one layer below were an array of sliced oranges and grapefruit: extremely disappointing and most likely cheap fruits. Overly expensive, and not worth your money.

1.0,9/29/2016,"I just want to clarify that this 1 star rating is based on the fact that this is a Sarabeth's. Sarabeth's is a new york favorite that I actually think is usually worth the hype and the wait. I actually do love all their items and have never been disappointed. Until I tried the Tribeca location.A few weekends ago I tried the Tribeca location for the first time thinking the low ratings on yelp didn't seem to make sense since it's Sarabeth's. However, it made complete sense once we got our food items.I don't know how many times I've gotten eggs benedict from Sarabeth's since it is my favorite brunch dish and I truly think Sarabeth's does it the best. This eggs benedict though, was so unsatisfactory. The bread was so dry I wasn't sure if ti was fresh. The egg was probably the best part but the hollandaise was lacking in flavor.I also usually love their lemon ricotta pancakes. They're so light and fluffy, not to sweet with amazing lemon flavor. However, these were not fluffy. They were tough. The batter was definitely overworked. They were also flat and not fluffy by any means. They were tough and chewy. I did not enjoy these pancakes. The flavor was still but the texture definitely ruined the pancakes I normally love.Honestly they were not so terrible to the point I'd send them back, but they were terrible for Sarabeth. I also noticed that prices have gone up quite a bit and Sarabeth's and it's a shame that the quality has gone down. Hopefully it's only at the Tribeca location.

3.0,7/21/2016,"Had such high hopes for coming here after making our first visit to Sarabeth's in Key West.  We tried to get brunch while in Key West but couldn't make the time.  We figured what better than where she started!NYC has multiple locations so I didn't know which one would be best based on neighborhood but this was the area we wanted to be in.I was very disappointed with the service.  It started out right with the offer of holding our luggage since we were departing from the restaurant.  But once we were seated in a tiny corner our server was just absent minded the whole time.  Asking him multiple times for cutlery and water was a turn off.  When asked for explanations to the menu he was not eager to explain anything or offer an suggestions.  Worse off the menu did not speak to us as Key West did.  This was a below average selection of brunch items that I felt I could have gotten anywhere for less.The prices did not match the quality of food and there didn't seem to be the love that we saw put into what we ate at Sarabeth's in Key West.I started with WHITE PEACH BELLINI.  Nothing special just your average brunch cocktail.  To share we had the AVOCADO & BURRATA TOAST sunnyside egg, petite greens, espelette and once again for the price we paid nothing special.  There was only one egg on the 2 pieces of toast and the burrata was not warm and melty as I expected.For my entree I had the ADULT GRILLED CHEESE manchego, gruyère, cheddar, velvety cream of tomato soup.  I couldn't go wrong with this dish since there was so much cheesey goodness.  The sandwich was on a pretzel bread and had a mustard to dip in.  The soup was creamy rich and hearty which I appreciated.Overall, I wouldn't go back to Sarabeth's in NYC.  With all the other brunch options out there there will not be a second trip.  Despite my emotional attachment to Sarabeth's I will save it for Key West!",0,0,0,Niti B.,"Chicago, IL",327,706,195

Ordered the cobb salad, lemon and ricotta pancakes, and my friend ordered the steak sandwich. The cobb salad had lots of ingredients and all tasted very fresh. Steak sandwich was good but somewhat unimpressive. The pancakes were by far the best dish! It was fluffy, flavorful, came with sweet-tasting blackberries, and the syrup on the side complemented it very well. Would definitely come back again to try other items on the menu!

2.0,7/10/2016,"Let me preface by noting that I usually have good experiences at some of the other Sarabeth's locations.  The Tribeca location is very spacious, open, and very well lite (all things I appreciate).  That said, the food and service here are average at best for Tribeca (and even relative to other Sarabeth's locations).  The food itself is very, very unimpressive for the price (I get brunch food in particular is generally all the same, but you might as well hit a diner for what you get here).  In general, most of the menu items just seem to be missing flavor and tend to be on the heavy side.The service tends to be the biggest downfall of this location.  While the waitstaff is generally very inviting and friendly, they are notably inattentive (particularly at the bar).  I can't put my finger on if they're habitually understaffed or just distracted, but it's a consistent issue either way.All in all, while a beautiful atmosphere, this location is very unimpressive.",3,1,1,Matt K.,"New York, NY",262,93,22

2.0,6/30/2016,"Came here for brunch with my two girlfriends. We had made reservations in advance, which I'm glad we did because the place was pretty packed and we probably would've had to wait at least 30 minutes for a table of 3. The ambiance was decent, with bright lighting - perfect for brunch. The noise was a little loud, but we weren't screaming over each other and I prefer busy/bustling places for brunch so I didn't mind. The service was okay, but our server was polite and seemed too busy to check up on us, although he was considerate in making recommendations and accommodating my friend, who is lactose intolerant. The food was mediocre at best. The almond French toast that my friend has was pretty good, especially because it was served hot right away, but it was nothing out-of-this-world. I had the lemon ricotta pancakes with a side of fruits, which I was very disappointed in. You could barely taste the ricotta flavor and although you could taste the lemon a bit, it was not what I expected. They also did not give as much syrup, especially between the 3 of us and we were in need of more, which was not readily available because of the business during brunch time. The fruit was fresh, but it wasn't proportional to the 3-4 pancakes I had. The dishes were on the heavier side and although I felt full, I feel like I only stuffed as much as I could because of the rather higher end price we paid - not because the food was amazing. Overall, I thought the place was overpriced and hype - the food wasn't that great and although I liked the ambiance, it was not enough for me to want to come back. I had heard a lot of good things about the Sarabeth brand (including their amazing jelly), which is why I was excited, but I was disappointed and a little annoyed that I had to pay for mediocre pancakes that I could've made at home.",0,0,0,Hana C.,"Boston, MA",580,103,184

It did not disappoint one bit. I highly recommend coming to this location and not the one by Central Park for a few reasons:         1) Much better crowed and atmosphere in general         2) Little to no wait compared to 45 minute wait in Central Park         3) Celebrity sightings!!!We came for Saturday brunch and the menu was so expansive it was hard to pick! We ended up ordering things from the lunch and brunch menu. The must try was the almond french toast... I thought I was eating a doughnut. It came with strawberry compote. DELISH! We also ordered the avocado toast (on the lunch menu) which came with over easy eggs. Very different but extremely tasty.I do not recommend the Eggs Benedict, though. It was a bit bland and disappointing after the other amazing dishes. Besides the amazing service we received, another huge perk were the celebrity sightings!

(Which is not something that should ever be done, pork is a dangerous meat to undercook, it was clearly raw in the center)!I called over a nearby server and he took and look and told me he would fetch the manager. When she came over she took a look and asked me if I would like them to cook it more. I said ""yes, of course"" but instead of bringing me a new one or even apologizing for the mistake she took it away and had them heat up my current meal. When they brought it back I never received an apology or even acknowledgement of their mistake. Horrible service horrible manager. On top of that we felt watched the entire meal.

Fish was nicely cooked and accompanied by some insanely tasty shiitake and golden raisins that are the most plump and juicy (do they make their own raisins?)

The Tuscan Kale was more like over cooked spinach, and I have know words to describe the Parmesan polenta, than flavorless mush.  The server, who must have been new, never once asked us how our meal was.  Truly one of the most disappointing dinner experiences I have ever had in NYC.   There are too many great restaurants to ever have to experience the mediocrity of the food and service at Sarabeth's.",0,0,0,Tannis O.,"Scranton, PA",28,17,2

2.0,11/9/2015,"I've been wanting to go to Sarabeth's for such a long time! I did quite a bit of research about which location to pick and of course made a reservation a week in advance for Sunday brunch.The TriBeCa location is really beautiful. There were lots and lots of kids there for brunch- TriBeCa is a family neighborhood so that is understandable. We arrived about 2 minutes late for our 1pm reservation but were not seated until 1:20. Not a problem- it's a scene, and we spent the time people watching.When we were seated our server was very nice. She made recommendations on the menu based on our preferences. We knew going there we needed to have a famous Bloody Mary with pickled vegetables ($14), and there was an option to add a giant shrimp ($3)... Obviously I needed the shrimp. Our server recommended Tito's vodka, and we agreed. This added another $2 (which she did not say until I saw the bill.) By the time everything was said and done- $19 for a breakfast cocktail. Now, I have no problem spending $19 on a great drink, and this was delicious... I was sipping away, and my friend looked at my drink and grabs a long paper straw cap out of my glass (it was disguised as a pickled vegetable.) I told our server about it, and she did offer to have a new one made, but didn't appear to think it was a big deal? It's not, as far as cleanliness, just a little bit of paper, so I declined to have a new one made. But, at the end of the day I found garbage in my $19 Bloody Mary. I felt that I should have been comp'd for something- maybe not 20 bucks- but maybe a muffin?I ordered the steak sandwich which was fine but had a really beautiful presentation- as did all of the food ordered by myself and my friends.Would I go back?

They have a private dining area which can probably fit a nice size party of up to forty people with plenty of room to spare. This room has two private restrooms as well which is always a plus.The velvety cream of tomato soup is phenomenal. I've never really cared for tomato soup, but this is not your typical tomato soup. It is very rich, hearty, smooth yet with bits of chunky goodness, just downright delicious. It really is a meal in itself and is quite filling. I ordered the hanger steak frites for my entree and it is pretty darn disappointing. First off, this is the only time I've ever ordered a steak and a waiter does not ask me how I like it done. It was kind of bizarre but I thought perhaps they preferred to serve it a certain way? Anyway, when I received the steak it was rare. Almost everyone in my party who ordered the steak had to send it back. I asked to make mine medium at that point. Funny thing is that when I got it back, I was perplexed if anything was even done. It looked the exact same to me, but when I touched it I suppose it was a tad warmer in temperature so something must've been done right? I kept it since I would've felt so awful to send it back again and cause a scene (plus I didn't want spit in my food). Nonetheless I have to say the waiters appeared to be very apologetic. The steak was bland and oh my goodness the greens were so gross! The fries were blah, I didn't even want to eat it - and I usually love fries! I don't know what béarnaise sauce is or what it is supposed to taste like but it tasted like 100% mustard. No thank you. I didn't know if the sauce was supposed to go with my steak or my fries - either way, I wasn't a fan and did not touch it after the initial tasting of it. The cookies here are not that good either, I didn't know that can be messed up but I guess it can be.Overall, the food here is not great except for the tomato soup which is an absolute must order! The service is very friendly and attentive (minus that only one person out of like seven were asked how we wanted our steak cooked but that's besides the fact).

Third - it's a pretty laid back vibe. A lot less stuffy than the other Sarabeth locations. A lot of families with strollers for the early weekend breakfast rush, then the crowd gets more mixed towards brunch. I like that it isn't a 100% hangover-nursing crowd.

1.0,4/25/2015,"Yuck. My first visit to Sarabeth's Tribeca was about a year ago. I was attending a work event that reserved a private area for a buffet luncheon. I found the food to be average, but immediately stopped eating as soon as I realized the jumbo shrimp was completely gray inside... as in raw. Unfortunately I had already eaten several bites, so I did end up feeling sick afterward, but luckily I didn't require medical attention, which I would have had I eaten a substantial amount, as eating uncooked shrimp is extremely dangerous. A year later, I seemed to have put the experience behind me. While out and about with my husband and daughter in the area, we decided to stop for lunch/brunch, and decided to not order something that could potentially be undercooked. Perhaps, I thought, that was a unique instance. We stupidly didn't just go absolutely anywhere else. Since we arrived at 3:04, and Late Lunch begins at 3pm, we were not permitted to order from the brunch menu that we watched be served to patrons for the next hour. The Late Lunch menu is totally underwhelming. I ordered a Caesar salad, and for $18, you might think that you'd get a little dressing or  something more thoughtful than four 8"" long stalks of uncut romaine lettuce. Although it wasn't busy, we were sat beside a noisy kitchen, where staff slammed into our table between yelling with each other as they zoomed by, nearly knocking over hot coffee on my infant daughter. A busboy spontaneously snatched away our sugar tray as we had our coffee, and getting someone to bring the food we ordered (and ordering to begin with was challenging enough) was unreasonably difficult. We couldn't even leave in a reasonable amount of time because getting our check proved impossible, as did getting them to process and return our credit card. Water refill? Forget about it. Nobody cares what you want or if you end up getting what you ordered. Service is nonexistent at Sarabeth's, and the food is at best bland and at worst dangerous. Tribeca has plenty of restaurants- Skip Sarabeth's unless you're a glutton for punishment.",1,1,1,Samantha S.,"New York, NY",19,36,1
1.0,4/25/2015,"Awful, to the point that it made me angry. And, before I say anything else, let me say that I observed all of the staff, all of the plates of food that passed me, and all the other tables... all [awful] roads lead to the manager.My wife and I went in for a late lunch/brunch. We also had our one year old baby with us, who was asleep. I was holding her. It was a little after 3 PM. Not at all crowded in this very large restaurant. Yet, for some reason, we were seated at the table next to the kitchen entrance/exit. We were given a rather short lunch menu. However, we saw plates with brunch food passing us, so we asked for the brunch menu. We were told no.I did not see anything that thrilled me so I just ordered a cup of coffee and my wife- who also was not impressed with the menu, but starving- ordered a salad with extra dressing on the side. Moments after we placed our order we saw another diner's French Fries. They looked good. We wanted to add an order of Fries to our order, however, we could not find our waiter. Finally, we asked the person who poured my coffee. The coffee... I was not asked if I wanted cream or milk or skim milk. They just brought me a little carafe with whole milk in it. Fine. I would have preferred skim, but- whatever. Not a big deal. A few minutes later, my wife's salad was served. No extra dressing on the side. No French Fries. And no waiter. We could not find him. Though the restaurant was not that busy, there were a lot of staff members rushing back and forth. They just didn't really seem to be doing anything. Actually- allow me to correct myself. They were doing a lot of socializing with each other. Loudly. As I looked for our waiter- or anyone- whom I could ask to bring the Fries and the extra dressing, my wife- famished- started to eat. While my wife was eating, and I was holding a sleeping baby, and there was HOT COFFEE on the table, a waitress quickly threw a stack of plates and silverware at a busboy right next to our table. As he spun around to bring them back into the kitchen, he banged into our table with his hip quite hard. No apology or acknowledgement of any kind.I finally got the attention of one of the hostesses and asked for the extra dressing and fries. For some reason, just after this happened, a busboy came to our table and took the little dish of coffee sweeteners. This is relevant, because when my coffee cup was refilled, I didn't have any sweetener to use.The fries and extra dressing eventually came. The fries were good. The salad was really nothing special. It was the same salad we could have gotten virtually anywhere. Maybe another place might have refilled our water. When my wife was done eating, once again, we could not find our waiter to get our check so we could leave. And then, when he finally brought the check, he never returned to take it with our credit card. After waiting longer than we should have, I caught the manager and asked him to take it. I should also mention that the entire time we were there, there was a line of people waiting to use the bathroom(s). The line extended into the dining area. As I said at the beginning, I put the blame solely on the manager. He should know how to train and supervise his team. We will never go back. This restaurant's location is in a busy part of TriBeCa with many other dining options. I'd advise anyone to explore those options rather than eat here.",4,3,5,Former Restaurant Writer C.,"New York, NY",30,21,0

3.0,4/19/2015,"Review by a Tribeca parent:When my kids are rambunctious, I am glad there is a playground nearby called Sarabeth's. My kids are free to run around, scream and play there. Unfortunately, the place also happens to serve food, and it is really too bad, because the servers' legs and patrons' chairs keep getting in my children's way. I can only give this a three-star review, since the people there do not seem to understand how special my children are and insist on giving us and our children dirty looks when it is their fault they are eating in my children's play area!  How rude!My review:This could be a very special place for brunch. It's clear Sarabeth's has taken great care to provide an interesting menu, a pleasing atmosphere and good service. The experience was ruined on both of my visits, however, by incredibly loud and rude families. On both visits, the din was so loud, my ears were left ringing.  Also, children were left to run around into patrons and servers while their oblivious parents sip mimosas and bloody marys. On my visit this morning, the children in one large family group kept getting louder and louder, and rather than suggest the kids demonstrate a little more courtesy, the parents in the group kept getting louder and louder, as well. Before long, everyone at that one table was bellowing and no one else in the room could hear a thing at their own table. I can't hold Sarabeth's completely blameless. While I pity the servers having to negotiate unsupervised children, the servers certainly have the right to ask parents to keep their children seated for the children's safety, the servers'  ease and other patron's comfort. Moreover, it can't be lost on the staff how unpleasantly loud the place is--half the orders have to be repeated because the servers cannot hear patrons over the playground-level volume. I love the decor, but some design elements to keep the noise down and soften all the hard concrete edges of the old warehouse building would make the space much more accommodating to the din of families and other patrons. I enjoyed my Goldie Lox omelet with lox and cream cheese, and people in my party loved the preserves served with the muffins, but the aural assault and frenetic environment caused by children treating Sarabeth's like it was a McDonald's playland ruined what should have been a nice, relaxing brunch. My two meals were very good, but I see no reason to return, no matter how good the food may be. A great brunch is as much about the atmosphere as it is the food, and Sarabeth's simply doesn't deliver the whole brunch package.",3,2,1,Augie R.,"Chicago, IL",167,835,147
2.0,4/19/2015,"Just not a good visit. Slow service, bland food and dirty overall feel. We ordered the guacamole and chips as a starter. The chips were fine but needed salt. The guacamole needed to be seasoned. The frittata was just plain bad. Undercooked, very bland and hardly any chorizo and peppers. Finally, the lobster roll was just ok too. Definitely not worth $28. Again, under seasoned and an odd sweet taste to it we couldn't put our finger on. Oh, and the Bloody Mary needed seasoning as well...  only thing the drink had going for it was tons of horseradish. On a positive note, the Campari and soda was fine, lol.. Overall just a bad experience. Tons of screaming children at brunch time which would be tolerable if the food was up to snuff.

4.0,4/14/2015,"Made a recent visit to this location for an excellent Sunday brunch.Having read other reviews, I knew to try the tomato soup. I don't even particularly like tomato soup, but when an item receives such unanimous acclaim, it must be ordered. The soup was incredible; rich and velvety with perfectly diced chunks of tomato throughout, well worth the praise that has been heaped upon it. The steak sandwich that our server convinced me to try was really good. The hangar steak was a little more done than I generally enjoy, but it blended so well with caramelized onion, frisee salad, and rustic ciabatta bun that all was forgiven. And the skin-on french fries that came with were amazing, they reminded me of a more delicate version of those found at Five Guys.The only item that I found disappointing was the bloody Mary. I've come to expect bloody Mary's to be savory and spicy, this one was so mild that it was almost sweet. I'm not sure if there is a spicy option that I simply neglected to order.Our server Dewey was friendly and knowledgeable, but it was clear that he was fairly busy. Service was attentive, but things came out a little slow. A minor error was made in the order, but it was remedied with such speed and professionalism that it isn't worth discussing here.

I'd suggest sharing it with two people unless you are feeling piggish like me.It came with a croissant but I was too full to eat it. My boyfriend said it was good. The restaurant was very nice and clean, had great service and wasn't too busy on the weekday. Really worth stopping in for breakfast or brunch.

Loved this location because the restaurant wasn't as cramped as the upper west side.

The cream of tomato soup is one of our favorites. I was pleasantly surprised I liked the granola with fruit and yogurt. The crunchy and creamy texture combined with the fresh fruit was refreshing. The steak sandwich looked amazing and my husband did not leave a bite. The noise level was comfortable, and we could really enjoy our conversation. Our waiter was on cue, very friendly and attentive.

4.0,4/2/2015,"Perfect place for a classy brunch.  I had my mother and grandmother visiting from out of town, and I was looking for brunch in the area that had a little bit more space for grandma, but still had a warm atmosphere.  This is the place.  They accommodated my request for a 11:30am reservation, when I only called at 8pm the night before.  I was pretty impressed since this is typically a very very booked up place.I got the Salmon Eggs Benedict, which was EXCELLENT.  Extensive brunch menu, which is typically a rare find.  Everyone will find something that they like on this list.My only complaint---  because the restaurant is bigger than some of these cozier breakfast spots in Manhattan, the acoustics can be somewhat poor with a larger brunch crowd.  The waiter was extremely friendly, but did not speak very clearly, or loud enough to compensate for all the noise in the background.  I essentially translated the whole time to my grandmother (who understandably had trouble in the background noise), but even I had a very very difficult time hearing him since he spoke so low.  Otherwise, it was a perfect experience!",1,1,1,Leigh S.,"New York, NY",227,29,4

In late December I inquired about having an event and Mini and Alana the General Managers were who I communicated with via email. They have a number of options brunch, Lunch, dinner, seated dinner, buffets etc. After a lot of hemming and hawing between my mother and I we decided on a buffet dinner. (we had a number of vegans and vegetarians in our party and the buffet dinner selections gave us the greatest latitude. My only complaint is that they require 14 business days to confirm your party. I understand they need time but that is almost three weeks. I had several people cancel last minute as it was very inclement weather. It was kind of stressful but when I did email to confirm I was specific as possible about our selections and all of the items in the contract. (my mother who was kind enough to foot the bill for this soiree reported that when she settled up they charged for the final tally of 18  present guests not the confirmed talley of 21-I appreciated this)The private room was great and I ordered balloons from Balloon Saloon (see review) we had three servers for our party who passed the hors-doeuvres and brought us drinks. The food was pretty good especially the scallops and salmon. I ordered extra sides and appetizer platters which I probably didn't need to do. Over all it was great-I would definitely investigate having an event here-I felt they worked to make it successful and it was.

Next year, however, might be the first year that we break that tradition. While the food is still good, there are just too many other brunch places where the food is amazing. Hate to say it, but this was probably my last brunch here. We all started with the Four Flowers Juice, which may be the only thing that'll bring me back to Sarabeth's. That combination of fruits and juices is just perfection. We ordered the Guacamole + Chips to start and I also ordered a bowl of the Velvety Cream of Tomato Soup. Okay, I lied. That soup could definitely bring me back too. Rich and creamy and chock full of tomatoes, it is by far my favorite dish on the menu.I think the entrees at Sarabeth's could be better. I ordered the Maine Lobster Roll and the rest of my family ordered their traditional Salmon Eggs Benedict. While not horrible, nothing to write home about either.

2.0,3/6/2015,"2.5 Stars is what I'll rate my experience and thoughts on the food I had at the infamous Sarahbeth's.   I was really really disappointed with our brunch last week.   I was able to easily make an 11:45am reservation on Open Table but arrived at 11am.  There were four  people corralled at the hostess desk so I said, ""hi,"" to all of them because they all looked at me when I approached them.   It was confusing  whom I was supposed to inform about my reservation but decided the lady in front of the monitor at the hostess stand (even though she didn't greet me).  Actually none of them did greeted me or welcomed me to the establishment.  Greetings aside,  we were quickly seated after, ""the hostess,"" informed the person on her right our table seating.   We were grateful to be seated early but ended with a table right by the WC (that's water closet or as we'd usually say,  the toilets).  For such a large establishment and the frequency a table of four is used for two,  this area really shouldn't be used for customers seating at all.  I would suggest either leaving this area empty,  replaced by a couch for WC waiting area or simply a waiter service stand.   We felt awful being seated here even though there were other tables available.  This furthered the lack of hospitality we felt.  While our waitress and buss boy was adequate the meals we had were disappointing, mediocre, plated really sloppy and not worth the money spent.   My husband ordered the lumberjack.  He's usually not picky about food but he didn't think the value,  execution or quality was any better than our local diner - that's bad coming from him.  My Lobster Ragu Special was ok.   The greens were greens.  The polenta cake was the best on the plate,  nicely seared and creamy.   The fried egg,  you got it, just a fried egg.  The piece de resistance, the lobster was ill prepared and overly spiced with Creole/Southern seasoning or what resembled Chinese XO Sauce which totally took away the flavor of the lobster (i.e. I was left with the texture of lobster but not the sweetness).  This made me believe the lobster was probably not the freshest,  otherwise,  why mask the natural flavor in such a strong Ragu sauce.  Angry.  Luckily we were able to get our check quickly and skip out of this place without anymore regrets.",0,0,1,Angela N.,"New York, NY",82,507,2196

The eggs benedict were awesome. Egg was perfect, the English muffin was super soft and yummy as well! It came with a side salad--would have liked to select options for a side given how expensive the dish was, but not a big deal. I thought it was really delicious.

The service is fast and to the point, and when we needed something and our server couldn't be found, we asked one of the many other staff that were everywhere. I got the scrambled egg popover, which was just ok. Im pregnant and asked that the eggs were well done. When I got my food they had also put the cream cheese on the side because they said it was not pasteurized. I appreciated them looking out for me, but would have preferred the server checked if I wanted something else as the meal without the creamcheese was pretty bland.  I also had a side of chicken apple sausage which was good.

3.0,12/24/2014,"The only thing that really stood out to me for the restaurant in a very positive way was the decor. Sarabeth has beautiful light themed brunch place with all the traditional choices for entrees. I came here during the summer with a couple of friends for brunch. They have all the traditional selections and I believe they're particularly known for their popovers. I ordered the salmon eggs benedict for as it looked to be an interesting twist on a traditional entree. I also substituted the english muffin for a pumpkin muffin. I actually learned on this day that the english muffin are always included on the bottom of the eggs benedict and that substituting it out, would really change my experience. Definitely a good learning experience for an uninitiated foodie. On to the food, the salad came a little bit bland and uninspired. The poached eggs were alright, but when presented just on top of the salmon, it looked almost sloppy. Moving onto the salmon, there were parts which were too thick to chew and definitely not as tender as I would have liked. Because there was no english muffin, the texture of the dishes was also too viscous and liquidy. There was nothing solid I could really bite my teeth into. I will say that the Pumpkin Muffin was quite nice, but not enough to make up for the rest of the dish. Part of it is my fault, but even then, the dish could have been better executed.",0,0,0,Kevin J.,"Manhattan, NY",712,246,1045

The menus at all locations are consistent, however I find the Tribeca location to be the least crowded and provide the best service.

4.0,12/11/2014,"Sarabeth's is adorable. I came here for a lunch with two friends who were visiting from out of town. Back then, the weather was beautiful and there was no fear of freezing or slipping, a luxury that feels far, far away now that the winter season is back. The inside is cozy, and the ceilings are high--the color scheme is light, neutral colors. Mostly white, which makes the whole place feel brighter. Perhaps that was the effect of it being the middle of a summer day. A light that mimicked sunlight filled the dining area where we sat, which was big enough to drown out the voices of tables nearby. We sat by the wall of mirrors, which adds to the feeling of spaciousness, and offered great lighting for pictures to commemorate the occasion. One of the most enticing things on Sarabeth's menu is their Farmer's Omelette--$15 for an omelette with leeks, ham, potato, and gruyere (one of the best cheeses one can put on food). I was torn between that and the Goldie Lox, which also sounded great, but ultimately decided I didn't really want scrambled eggs AND smoked salmon. They have a good selection of sweet breakfast as well, as my friend got the fluffy French Toast. They allow you to choose a muffin with your omelette/egg entrée. The waitress came by with a basket of warm breakfast carbs that almost made me drool. They smell fresh-baked, emulating that sweet scent of flour and sugar. I ultimately chose a Berry Corn muffin, and I did not regret it. You can also choose regular corn, bran, banana, a scone, or toast and jam (""preserves"" if you're following their fanciness). When my omelette arrived, I eagerly dove in. the potatos were cooked well, and went great with the ham and leeks. Of course, leek is a fairly powerful flavor, so that was what I tasted most of, but they were mellowed out by the starch. I don't normally like cheese in my omelettes (I think eggs and cheese outside of a breakfast sandwich is kind of weird in terms of texture), but I couldn't turn down gruyere. I was pleasantly surprised and happy to say that it was a great dish. The fluffy French Toast lived up to its name--the bite that I tried was great, the kind of sweet that gets your salivary glands going. At $16, it was also worth the money. I know that Sarabeth's also does dinner, so I would be happy to come back for a meal other than lunch and see how it goes. But for a breakfast/brunch place, it felt upscale without being too stuffy, and offered quality eats in a clean, comforting atmosphere.",0,0,0,CHRISTINE Z.,"New York, NY",73,289,35

It seems that Sarabeth has been stiffing their customers at this location and they need a new chef.  This restaurant is in Tribeca - and the people that go for brunch are locals.  I'm appalled by them and have decided to write this review.  I took my father as he's visiting me from out of town to Sunday brunch to Sarabeth!  We each ordered their special brunch - me:  Eggs Benedict, him: Scrambled eggs.  The MENU clearly said that it included muffin/preserve.  So, I asked the waiter to bring our bread in advance while the food was getting ready.  He brought us each one muffin and two small samples - which I was OK with.  But then my eggs Benedict arrived but without the base muffin !!!  I asked the waiter why my muffin (which is the eggs are placed on) is missing and he said that the MENU is misleading and the muffin isn't included in my order !!!!!!   So, Sarabeth decided to bring my Eggs Benedict without a muffin !!!  But I told him that the menu says we are entitled to bread and preserve and he said I had to order a breadbasket for $14 if I wanted it!  I don't think I was asking anything out of the ordinary.  Plus Le Pain Quotidian has complimentary jars of jam !  Yes, one has to pay for extra bread, but none the less, if the meal comes with bread you just have it with some jam!  What is the big deal that they would do such a stupid thing to a customer !  I'm appalled and offended.  I would have ordered a $14 basket or nothing, but for the restaurant to offend their customer so badly is unacceptable.  Of course, after living in NYC and always tipping over 25% - this was the first time in my life that I left only 15% !!!  Sarabeth should be ashamed of themselves.  Either change their menu to go open their restaurant elsewhere.

The preserves were amazing as usual. The scones are seriously addictive.I ordered the steak hash with poached eggs; my friend had ordered this at a different location and it came with a side of a muffin, scone, croissant, or toast with preserves. Me and the bf loved her dish and were excited to have it again. First of all, this dish didn't come with a side of crack muffin/scone/croissant at this location. It was also very, very disappointing. The eggs were overcooked and hard. And for a dish called ""steak hash with leaches eggs,"" it sure didn't come with much steak. The 'salad' that came on the side was really mostly carrots. A lot of it. My plate arrived a bit cold. I had to really force myself to finish my food.The bf ordered the stuffed popovers, which left him unimpressed. His parents ordered the eggs benedict (which sadly, we had said was really good) and the farmer's omelette; both were disappointed.We might have caught them on a bad day, but it's still Sarabeth's and I have come to expect a certain level of quality from them, especially at their price range.The waiter was friendly, and the muffins/scones+ preserves are crack.

Food: Bread rolls were stale, they tasted like they had been sitting there for a few days. $14 for a basket of muffins?? I had the eggs Benedict which was just blahhh. The eggs were way over cooked.  I would have sent it back, but our waitress seemed to of disappeared after our food came. The pancakes a few people had.

And to top that they tasted different.  Like two chefs had made them two different ways.  One girls food tasted more like cinnamon and the other more like lemon??

Good clean cured salmon with shapely poached eggs, creamy hollandaise sauce, and a refreshing salad on the side. Yum!Another winner is the almond french toast.

With plenty of room and ample space between tables, it is a great venue for larger parties. It could be a great place (or a terrible place) for a first date, as you will actually be able to hear and understand every word they say...The Bloody Mary was decent, but we elected to pass on the option to add shrimp. It wasn't quite spicy enough for my preference, but had a smooth yet authentic texture and the right amount of octane. We had some high hopes for the bakery items, but just felt slightly underwhelmed by the execution of an unremarkable scone and pumpkin muffin. Not bad as a bread basket item, but nothing I would go out of my way for. We had the Popeye's Eggs and the Chorizo Frittata. Portion size was appropriate, yet we agreed that the items appeared better on the menu then tasted on the dish. There was nothing notably off or poor in execution, just did not feature the ""wow"" factor that makes you crave a particular item or dish.

My friend and I made reservations for Saturday brunch, very simple online to make and we were seated quite easily. We tried two muffins - banana and pumpkin. The muffins are a little on the drier side, however they were flavorful and the jam and butter that is provided help bring some moisture. My friend ordered the regular eggs benedict and I opted for the salmon eggs benedict. Both were great! Each came with a salad where the dressing was just right (light, with a little creamy consistency). The eggs were poached so that the yolks would run over the salmon (in her case, ham? Or was it canadian bacon?). The muffins are more like actual muffins instead of what you'd think of an english muffin that you'd buy in a grocery store. I'm not sure how much I enjoyed the muffin, they were too tall and a little difficult to eat. But overall, I loved loved loved the dish, the salmon was so good! Cappucino /Lattes were good also!

I got the chorizo and sweet pepper frittata with manchego, which sounds amazing, but it was lackluster. Very small and bland, and $15. NOT worth it. Almond-crusted french toast was decent, but again not amazing. Corn chowder special tasted like the water that remains after boiling corn on the cob. Steak hash and eggs for $18.50 had 3 slivers of ""steak.""

1.0,7/12/2014,"A recent visit to Sarabeth's Tribeca left me debating which was worse: the food or the service.  Each was abysmal and a strong candidate for the ""worst aspect of the meal"" award.  The service can be summed us as virtually non-existent.  Although there were several wait staff at the restaurant and only about 4 total tables, my waiter disappeared for long stretches of time leaving me without water or coffee.  After dropping off my food, he never returned until well after I was finished eating.  He then disappeared again. To get my check, I had to go inside and seek out my bill from the hostess.As bad as the service was, the food was no better.  I ordered the eggs benedict with soft poached eggs and a side of home fries.  By the time the food reached my table, it was barely luke warm. The eggs were over-cooked to the point of being almost hard-poached.  The hollandaise was flavorless.  The English muffins were far too thick--each was about 2 inches high.  The potatoes were bland and soggy.I anticipated that the waiter would ask about my meal when I requested that he clear it and all I had eaten was one of the poached eggs and a few potatoes, as leaving 80% of your meal untouched is usually sign that there was something wrong.  He didn't care and simply took the plates.In the end, the winner of worst-of-the-worst was the food.  The service might have been passable had the meal been better.  On the other hand, no amount of attentive, friendly service would have saved the food.  This meal would have been unacceptable at an airport and left me wishing that I had just stopped at the nearby McDonald's instead.  The food would have been better and the breakfast would not have set me back $38.",0,0,0,Tracy P.,"Houston, TX",0,10,0

I wondered) with 3 scoops of chocolate gelato. Stunned, I decided to try to make the best of the situation, and started eating it.  About 1/3 through, my server comes out and says, ""Didn't you order the cookie plate?""  If I thought I ordered the cookie plate and she thought I ordered the cookie plate, then what was I doing looking at a bowl of chocolate gelato?  I suppose I should have followed my first instinct, and skipped dessert entirely.",0,0,0,Clyde S.,"Ossineke, MI",4,21,0

We of course noticed and told our server , Keishla who handled the whole thing like a true professional .

Our waitress Katrina was fast and on point. Helping us extremely. We stayed until about 430 which I guess is late for brunch because she started to clear all her tables . I couldn't find her and wanted to give the credit card so my boyfriends parents wouldn't pay. I went to the front and handed my card to the tall girl with glasses who gave me a fake smile and told me id have to find my server. I found out this was the assistant to the general manager . I couldn't believe she didn't want to help me . I soon found Katrina and we closed out and I thanked her immensely. She was super helpful with the menu and making sure we had enough plates to share . She even recommended a great bottle of barbera we all shared! However when we walked out I see the small Asian lady talking down to Katrina infront of other guests. I heard her lecturing her and being really mean . Honestly I felt like giving Katrina my business card and tell her to come work with me in my consulting company. I certainly would never treat my asserted employees like that . Last complaint I promise. Called back and asked to speak to events manager because my company wanted to do a buy out.

My friends truly enjoyed their iced coffees & had a second. If you like Bloody Mary's they're rather tasty. Our waitress was kind, always smiled & attentive - impressive considering it was a busy Sunday. If you arrive before 12 you probably won't have more than 20-30 min wait.

While we could still technically order brunch, I couldn't resist the Jack-o-Lantern pizza, and it didn't disappoint with pumpkin, candied pecans, and roasted Brussels sprouts. And, their house-made chips and guacamole appetizer is absolutely amazing!Service was great and attentive. The only downer to this restaurant is that when it's crowded, which I take it is often, it's super loud and hard to hold a conversation.

3.0,3/9/2014,"First stop with my beautiful bridal party to start my bachelorette weekend! The place was pretty empty when we first arrived for our 11AM reservation for party of 5 (figures) but soon became a baby/stroller central by the time our food were served.When we first entered, I was impressed by how spacious, clean, and simple yet elegantly designed/decorated it was! We were situated in a corner booth - perfect for us to throw all our coats and bags behind us. Their brunch menu was pretty extensive - lots of egg, sweets, and more lunch fare entrees to choose from - after coming back twice to check on us (too many options), we finally made our decisions. I went with the seafood Cobb salad without Bleu cheese + dressing on the side. My 4 bridal party went with smoked salmon cream cheese scramble, lobster roll, chorizo omelette, and parfait with a side of sausage. Even though my salad was huge - loaded with fresh avocado, bacon bits, scrambled egg, crab meat, lobster, and shrimp - the lemony dressing was light and refreshing - i didn't feel like it was worth the $25 dollar price tag. It was a good salad but not THAT good. Honestly, Nothing to write about or anything I would ever crave. My MOH's smoked salmon cream cheese scramble - the salmon was really dry and salty - to a point she barely touched her dish. The side corn muffin was also really stale? Which left us to think it was from previous morning. Didn't try the rest of the dishes but everyone seemed to enjoy her own. I can see why it's such a popular destination of weekend brunch especially for families (menu options for everyone, lots of seatings for big group).

Better than a diner but not as good as so many brunch places in NYC.  The setting is cute, however can be loud, what can you expect from a 200 seat restaurant. If I am going to spend 15.00 on eggs, the carb on the side should be spectacular. Anything in the way of a baked product here was awful. NYC has amazing bakeries, don't expect that here.

We started our brunch with mimosas, which tasted like a typical mimosa, but cost $12 each. I thought that was a tad pricey considering it's just orange juice and champagne, but I guess you get what you pay for, the ambiance and the environment. We also got unlimited coffee which was delish. My main dish was the smoked salmon eggs benedict which was heavenly. I hate salon with a passion. The first time I ever had salmon was in Paris, and it was raw on a sandwich. Since then, I just can't stand the sight or smell of salmon. I wanted to take a leap and I decided to go with the smoked salmon eggs benedict dish because I mean, why not try something different, and I am so glad I did! The salmon did not smell fishy or taste fishy. It tasted so yummie with the eggs and the  bread. They also give you a side of salad which was delish! My sister got the fluffy french toast. Oh my god, they were fluffy and divine! And they came with strawberries = perfection! Overall, this is a great place to have brunch. The ambiance is so lovely.

Yes, no wait time. On a Sunday.Food - We ordered an appetizer of guac & chips, salmon lox, salmon benedict, and almond crusted french toast. Everything was absolutely delicious. The guac was really fresh and the potato chips added an interesting twist. The salmon lox was flavorful (though a bit too cheesy). The salmon benedict was spot on, and the french toast had the right amount of crisp. Each portion was more than enough and the prices were reasonable.Service - The hostess was really accommodating even though we didn't have a reservation. The waiter was really patient with taking out order and offering us more chips (no additional charge, guys). He also was cool about taking a picture of the three of us.Venue - It was a classy setting (you know when restrooms are marked W.C.) and brightly lit.

5.0,2/15/2014,"This place rocks! Weekend brunch can get very hectic at Sarabeths and when you try their brunch menu, it all becomes rather obvious why it's so busy!What I like about this place, other than the fact I live about 8 minute walk from it, is that the food is of an excellent standard every time and the service is second to none. The staff are very competent - several times we have arrived for brunch when they have been rammed with clientele...literally standing room only as you wait to be seated and they told us the wait would be 15 minutes....the crazy thing is, with everyone standing around, you don't believe them and yet every time, they seat you pretty much at the specified wait time. Awesome! Onto the menu...I really like the chicken pot pie - it's usually nuclear hot so I break the roof of the pie and let it cool off before chowing down. At brunch, the salmon and egg omelette is amazing and for lunch, you really can't go wrong with their awesome burger.

3.0,2/5/2014,"Sarabeth's in Tribeca is charming and, despite being well-known, easy to snag last-minute brunch reservations for on Open Table. What I loved about the place is the beautiful, airy interior with plenty of windows to bask the entire dining area in sunlight ... it was the perfect venue to host a breakfast meet-up with an old friend from high school.  I never felt rushed by the servers at any point of the meal, even when we chatted away for well over two hours (8 years is a lot to catch up on)! The entire time, our waitress was prompt with our coffee/water refills and just overall pleasant.That being said, I don't think the food stands out enough to warrant the mark-up in prices. My eggs benedict was poached nicely, but for $18.50 I'd expect something mind-blowing... and/or a delicious side of home-fries a la brunch at Jane's (yes, I STILL cannot stop raving about Jane's!). But no, it was just the eggs benny with a side salad, and I was never offered my choice of muffin/croissant/scone/toast, as suggested on the menu. Quite bummed about that, actually - I was looking forward to trying the pumpkin muffin! My friend D got the 'famous' Lemon & Ricotta Pancakes as his entrée and holy shit, those five pancakes were MASSIVE. Can't offer an opinion of the taste, though, as I didn't have a bite...Sarabeth's is definitely on the pricier end of brunch, with food that was good but not particularly memorable. With so many other options available in the area/city, I don't see myself coming back anytime soon... unless (a) I need to make morning-of reservations for brunch in the area; (b) I'm coordinating a classy brunch for a large group of people; or (c) I get wheedled into giving Sarabeth's a second chance for some other meal (lunch/dinner).",0,0,0,Natalie K.,"New York, NY",272,130,1

The omelets that we ordered (we ended up there twice this weekend with different groups of friends) were greasy and undercooked. The french fries were soggy. The grilled cheese was unremarkable and the tomato soup resembled a pint of heavy cream with a few chunks of tomato. The salads came without dressing. The steak was undercooked. Basically, every dish was sub par. I think that there might be a quality control issue between the different locations. At the Flatiron location, the tomato soup is far less creamy (and really, really delicious) and the omelets are light, fluffy and not at all greasy.

2.0,1/20/2014,Quality going down??I used to love Sarabeths. Today was either an off day or the quality is going down. My husband has to eat a  gluten-free diet. Granted this isn't a great place for him but we thought he could at least order the Hanger Steak on the menu. After he places the order we were told they were out of it. So he got a burger with no bun. The small burger was lost on the plate with a few pieces of lettuce they called a salad. They also advised him not to have the fries since they are cooked in the same oil as the chicken tenders. I guess they can't make a batch of fries in separate oil. My eggs Benedict was cold and the egg yolk was hard and fully cooked. I am giving two stars in hopes that we both just had bad experiences due to an off day.  We live in the area and are willing to give it one more try before taking it off our local restaurant list.

The dish was served with a mountain high pile of scrambled eggs which were buttery and smooth - though I'm not used to having my eggs cooked in butter and was served on top a bed of spinach and ham on a warm buttered biscuit. Though I didn't try the buttermilk pancakes or the omelettes my friends ordered, it looked pretty plain and didn't appear to stand out in any way.

The interior is quite nice and was a lot bigger than I expected. They have a variety of seating in three main rooms--at least that is what I saw. It was a bit noisy, but that seems like it's to be expected of any fairly large restaurant in the city. The service was up to par. Our waitress was very nice and always checked up on us to see how we were doing with our food and drinks.I got the seafood salad and my friend got the country omelette. Also the seafood salad sounds really apprtizing, I would advise against it, only because there are better things on the menu and the salad is pretty pricey ($25!). For brunch I would either go for eggs or pancakes. My friend's omelette looked really good and it also came with his choice of a muffin or scone or bread.

At night there is usually an orchestra trio playing jazz or modern classical music - really cool and unusual in TriBeCa.The happy hours specials were pretty good and the service was attentive.

Our waitress seemed to have no knowledge of the menu (my friend asked for a ""fruity"" drink and she offered nothing- later we see the 5-fruit drink on the menu- would have been a perfect suggestion). Our food (pancakes, French toast) came out over a half hour later and both were lukewarm. Never got our sausage we had ordered. Sent back the lukewarm food which took FOREVER to return and still no sausage and waitress never checked on us!!  We finally had to call over the manager over who apologized and comped some items, which was appreciated. Waitress still never asked us if everything was ok, and 5 mins into eating my returned meal (still NOT HOT), another waiter asked if I was finished.  Overall very strange, slow service and average food.  Will not return.",0,0,0,Diana R.,"Manhattan, NY",19,111,5

Not kidding. Anyway, my fiancee does not like breakfast foods and I Iove them. This restaurant has a lot of great options both for those who enjoy breakfast and those who prefer lunch. FOOD:I ordered a decaf coffee, the 4 flowers fresh juice, and the popover eggs, which was scrambled eggs, cream cheese and scallions open face on a popover. Coffee was just eh, I didn't like the 4 flowers juice for $7, but I loved the popover eggs. I was surprised at how much I liked it actually. It also comes with a decent sized salad. My fiancee ordered the crab sandwich with fries instead of whatever side it came with that I cannot remember. He enjoyed the sandwich, but it was very small. It did look extremely fresh though. SERVICE: I thought the service was good. It was very busy and we had a reservation and only waited about 2 minutes. Waitress was also nice. I would definitely go back and get the popover eggs.

If that's what you're looking for, come here and have fun! For me the food has to be good before you can start talking about everything else, and my chicken and waffles pretty much let me down.

3.0,10/19/2013,"Why is there always a line on the sidewalk here for brunch on the weekends?Luckily I came for lunch in the middle of the week and the massive restaurant was pretty much empty so I didn't have to waste time waiting for a pretty mediocre meal.Not really seeing many good starters, we asked to start with the Basket of Muffins ($12 for 5). They were all pretty dry and not very tasty. The one exception was the Pumpkin one, which was actually moist and had some flavor.For one of the entrees, we got the Buttermilk Pancakes ($15 for 5). I guess they're supposed to have amazing pancakes here, but I didn't really understand what all the fuss was about. They tasted pretty one note to me. I prefer my pancakes stuffed full of a ton of stuff and with some more flavor, like the blueberry or banana-walnut beauties at Clinton St. Baking Company.We also got the Scrambled Eggs Stuffed Popover ($15), which were shockingly disappointing. The eggs contained scallions and cream cheese, but had way way too much of the latter, to the point of the eggs tasting more like cream than eggs. Gross.To go with the two entrees, we got the Chicken and Apple Sausage ($7.50 for 2), which were probably the best bite of the meal. They added some much needed flavor to go with the pancakes.Service was pretty lazy, so I would hate to see how long we would have needed to wait to get some service if it was anywhere near as crowded as it gets on the weekend.

3.0,10/13/2013,"We arrived at 1:30pm on a Sunday looking for brunch. The place was packed with an average sized line. However, the place was pretty big and hostess stated that it was a 15 mins. wait for 2 adults and a child. The wait was truly approximately 15 mins. Place was semi roomy so strollers are semi welcomed, but best if you don't bring the stroller or at least an umbrella/compact stroller. They do have an area where you can leave the opened stroller in the front, fits a couple or more if folded. Better if you bring just the carrier (car seat) for under 8 months if you drive, otherwise since the baby can sit up on their own, they can sit in the highchair. Great recognition system, whatever they use or strategy they use. They only ask your name and # in party. When they had seats for us, they came up to us and confirmed with the name and asked us to follow, while we were randomly standing in the room anywhere waiting. They knew/remembered exactly who is who. I watched them leading many parties to their tables. Everyone must be present to be seated.The choices of the brunch menu was average, not too little nor a lot of choices. However, I thought the prices were deeper in the pocket. Brunch with eggs don't come with anything but a muffin (many varieties) or toast. No drink, juice, or anything. They had lunch brunch menu ranging from sandwich to entree to salads. Everything was pretty much a la carte. They also had 6 children brunch choices, 3 breakfast items, 3 lunch items (available only after 3pm I think). I had the garden omlette (mushroom, peas, cheese), $15; four flower juice $7; partner had a cheese omlette, $14; coffee $4; baby had children's brunch of pasta (elbows) with tomato sauce, $10 (very pricey considering the portion was supposedly to be children's (about a bowl and a half of maybe a normal 6-8oz bowl size).

3.0,10/13/2013,"""Best Brunch in NYC"" says most reviews. I can't say I really agree. 3 stars for the pancakes, otherwise 2.I came here with a friend for brunch on Saturday at around 10:45am. It wasn't too crowded when we arrived but quickly filled up. We had a reservation, which I think was unnecessary for that hour but highly recommended for later on in the day. We were seated right away to a table in the back of the restaurant. We were promptly offered coffee before we had even looked at the menu. The waiter came back after a few minutes to take our order but my friend and I were so engrossed in conversation we hadn't made a decision yet. He gave us ample time to look at the menu without feeling rushed, which was appreciated. Food: Lemon and Ricotta Pancakes [$16.50]: They were quite delicious! They were big and fluffy and I could taste the lemon and feel the ricotta infused into the batter. The portion is huge and served with maple syrup and a pat of butter [I need more than a pat of butter for like 5 huge pancakes...just saying..]. The blackberries didn't add anything to the dish but they were fresh.Apple and Chicken Breakfast Sausage [$8]: First of all, $8 for two measly sausages? Are you kidding me? Secondly, they were nothing special. The apple preserves they were served on were tasty and while the saltiness of the sausage paired well with the preserves, they were a disappointment. I've had better sausage from the supermarket.Drinks:Bellini [$13] which came in a wine glass rather than a champagne flute. I think it was pear flavored. Like the breakfast sausage, it was nothing special. I've had better bellinis and for cheaper. Overall, this place was overrated. It took forever for our food to come and when it did, it was lukewarm. The bill was $45pp including tip. So not worth it. Needless to say, I was not impressed.I don't do brunch, and this is why.",0,0,0,Felisa F.,"Brooklyn, NY",52,198,192
3.0,10/10/2013,"***3.5 stars***I stopped by here for brunch with a large party of friends. The one thing you notice about most places in Tribeca, the typical restaurant crowd is reservedly older and family-oriented. Such was the case during our Sunday brunch. We luckily had reservations because the place was packed when we arrived (1pm). The place is pretty big, and will generally hold seating for large parties. There's seating outside, and inside there's a bar and even a sectioned off area for private events. Our group just so happened to be seated near the private event room. New on their menu was their take on Chicken & waffles, and I was sold on it when our waitress informed us that that particular item was sold out by noon the previous day. I enjoyed it quite a bit. The honey had a spicy flavor to it, and the waffles included dried fruit bits typical to those found in fruitcakes. The chicken, while only limited to a wing and a thigh, had a perfect golden-brown buttermilk crisp, and the inside was nice and juicy. My friends ended up trying their Farmer's omelette and the Salmon Eggs Benedict, both of which received somewhat lackluster fanfare. A few also ordered their Bloody Mary, which comes served in a huge wine glass. Reactions to that were pretty much the same as the food, which was okay at best, but a fair amount of other patrons in the dining area seemed to enjoy it.Service was on the slower side (it took around fifteen to twenty minutes before our food arrived), but understandable given our party size and how packed the place was for Sunday brunch. It's not as noticeable when you're engaged in conversation, but it becomes apparent if you're sitting there, starving, and waiting for your food to be served. If anything though, our waitress was friendly, and our water glasses were refilled consistently fast. Overall, a decent place for brunch, albeit on the pricier side.",0,0,0,Justin H.,"New York, NY",132,137,0
4.0,10/6/2013,"3.5 stars, just rounding up a bit.  Came here on a dreary Sunday with a friend. Definitely come downtown to this location for brunch- it's somehow grander, bigger, and less packed.  You can make reservations for large groups, but don't even bother if your're coming in groups of 2 at prime weekend brunch time- 12, 12:30.  They keep plenty of space open for walk ins.  Surprisingly, you'd think such a concept would warrant turning tables quickly, but that's not the case here.  Our waiter came by quickly, as did our food, but they didn't rush us for the check. In fact we had to egg them on for it.Brunch items are in the mid teens (HUGE portions though), and the menu features a true assortment of breakfast and lunch.  My friend and I shared the Goldie Lox- a wet egg scramble with cream cheese, smoked salmon, and your choice of bread, which includes a muffin type,  or croissant  with Sarabeth's ""legendary""preserves (whether I think they are legendary is up for debate, but sure, the butter is sweet and the jam is fruity).  The eggs were done well- you just have to love your scramble runny.  The banana muffin we shared was a bit dry, but I guess that's why they give a dollop of butter.  We also shared the famous lemon ricotta pancakes- I was looking forward to this, but they were unfortunately disappointing.  Whichever Yelper I read said they were the best pancakes ever surely hasn't had Clinton St.  They were lemon-y but not very ricotta based at all, and in fact, I found them a little dry. The special syrup it came with wasn't bad; had a nice citrus flavor but when we asked for a refill (there are 5 big cakes, after all), we got this overly sweet, blah syrup. I also got a side of applewood smoked bacon, which hit the spot because well, it's bacon, but did not taste applewood smoked at all- I was expecting more of a handmade house-cured thick cut sort of thing but, oh well.    My friend got a side of chicken sausage which was nicely charred and probably a bit better. Coffee is good, and strong and available for free refills.   I dig Sarabeth's because of the varied menu and atmosphere but it's certainly not the best brunch place ever, as some of the hype would suggest.",0,0,0,Stephanie Y.,"New York, NY",878,1242,25

Served with overdressed wilted greens.  My husband got the cheese omelette with pretty much a similar experience. We got the home fries which were just bland potatoes.

4.0,8/28/2013,"This location is an absolute WIN for any private event you might want to host.  I just held my sister's bridal shower at Sarabeth's Tribeca and it was a phenomenal experience.  The location is conveniently reached by the 2 or 3 train, and if you're coming by car, parking is actually not an impossibility in this quaint Manhattan neighborhood.  If all else fails, there's a parking garage across the street for your convenience.  The best part of this experience was the private dining room which we had all to ourselves, with it's own bathroom as well as a separate entrance on Jay Street.  This proved extremely helpful for myself and the other bridesmaids to set up the space before everyone -- who came in through the main entrance -- arrived.  We were able to bring things from the car to the room discreetly and swiftly as we had found parking right by the Jay Street entrance.  It could not have been more convenient than this!  We were a group of about 25-30 ladies and the room was very cozy without feeling at all cramped.  For a larger sized group, there is another private room (the ""Skylight"" room) that can be rented as well.  sarabethsrestaurants.com…Our room was outfitted with a projector screen that can be hooked up to a laptop (they have all the necessary wiring), and with portable speakers, the room can be transformed and party-ready within minutes.  I brought in my macbook, and a small pair of speakers and the slideshow played seamlessly as the guests arrived.  When we arrived an hour before the event, I had a two-tiered custom cake that they were able to take off my hands and refrigerate for me.  When we were finally able to go in to decorate the room, the cake had already been nicely displayed on the cake table, and it was perfect.  Voila!  (yelp.com/biz_photos/sara…)The service at Sarabeth's was impeccable, there were two waiters who like ninjas, served guests, cleared tables, etc like pros.  There was no sense of intrusion and it all went down very effortlessly.  Prior to the shower, I had been in constant communication with the manager, Mini, and her assistant Veronica, and they were both very responsive and helpful.  I was even able to pay a visit days before the actual shower just to test out the projector and Mini adjusted the view on the screen to have the slideshow play perfectly which was a major help. The only gripe I admit I had about the place is that we were only given 15 minutes to decorate the room.  Thankfully a group of six of us were there and all hands were on deck to ensure the space was converted to a beach-themed bridal shower within that short time frame.  But I can't say that I did not scramble like mad to get it all done in time.  The duration of the shower itself was two hours which was just right, though again, there was a lot of scrambling at the end of the event to clear up the room so that they could set up for another event following ours.  I think some of our guests may have felt a little rushed, but I do think to be fair, two hours is a good amount of time for a bridal shower, especially if it is organized and planned out thoughtfully and executed well.  Another issue is their requisite minimum number of guests for the room to be private.  I had to guarantee 30 guests, but we fell a little short of that.  Unfortunately I still had to pay for the absentee guests, which wasn't an exorbitant amount to being with (actually, really reasonable), but it would have been nice for that charge to be omitted since our group was large enough for the room to stay private for sure.  The restaurant wasn't busy at all at the time.  Food-wise, the presentation and the menu were excellent.  It was a really elegant touch that they printed a menu for us and placed it at each table setting it definitely added a lot of appeal to the overall look of an already beautiful space.  I didn't eat much because I was running around during the shower, but I did sample the lobster endive as well as a brownie, and both were delicious!  Their teas were wonderful, too.  Everyone appeared to have been pleased with the entire affair, including the food.  Overall, this was an amazing place, and I am really proud to have picked such a great spot to host my sister's bridal shower & the weather could not have been more perfect that day!  All that said, I would highly recommend Sarabeth's to anyone looking for a space to host a private event, specifically a Bridal Shower.4.5 Stars!!!!P.S. -- We picked up a few balloons at The Balloon Saloon on W Broadway, and it was a great way to add more pizzazz to the room.  A little pricey, but fun!",4,2,4,Jennifer C.,"Elmhurst, NY",559,645,1350

The spinach and goat cheese omelette was calling my name but I disgracefully tuned it out. The reason being that I wanted something lighter, thus the granola. . ? Yeah, I'm not sure how that makes sense, either. I should have known that a $9 bowl of granola would be pretty hefty and filling. I didn't finish it.

We ordered the famous lemon ricotta pancakes which were good but not AMAZING.  Also tried the Garden omelette which tasted like any other omelette and wasn't particularly memorable.  Ironically the bread and jam was the highlight of my meal.I highly doubt I will be back anytime soon with so many better options available in the city.

4.0,7/1/2013,"Went back a second time with a group of five on a Saturday around 1:30. We were able to snag a table outside after about a 20 minute wait. We had made reservations for 1 pm inside, but the weather was so beautiful and a table opened up quickly enough that we decided to sit out.The service was definitely better the second time around. Our waiter was pleasant, albeit quite, and everyone seemed pleased with their food.I ordered the margherita pizza. I know this is not a pizza restaurant, so I didn't expect it to be like the NYC pizzas that are amazing (and I pretty much know them all), but I just really love pizza and wanted it, so I got it. No it's not a NYC pizza, but if I happened to be at Sarabeth's and wanted a pizza, I would get it again. It's still pretty good in my book, especially if you know what you're getting.Another person at the table ordered the pumpkin waffles, which comes with a side of honey, raisins and sunflower seeds on top. Unique dish and he enjoyed it.Another got the burger, which comes with grilled red onions, tomatoes, and guacamole, side of fries. I don't think he thought this was an exceptionally good burger, but definitely good enough to polish off and eat all the fries.Another got the roasted chicken sandwich with Gruyere and watercress. She loved it.The last was the seafood cobb salad. This dish is really beautifully presented and she absolutely loved it. Our waiter said it was his favorite thing on the menu, too. We ordered two desserts - the peach/plum tart and the chocolate brownie. I didn't have the peach/plum, but there were mixed reviews. The brownie, I will say, was agreed by all to be pretty terrible. It tastes like a mix of chalk and fluffy chocolate cake. Not a brownie at all.Sarabeth's is definitely not the place to go for dessert. For sure. I once also tried their homemade oreo cookie, which was terrible as well.

3.0,6/25/2013,"Sarabeth's accommodated myself and my out of town guests (7 adults and a baby!) for a last minute 10 AM brunch reservation this past Sunday. They were gracious in the face of changing reservations twice, as well. Perfect, since our party had a few undecided members.My boyfriend and I arrived first, and were told we'd have to wait for our entire party to arrive before being seated. That's fine in the spirit of keeping the restaurant happy, but I have to say - they missed out on drink sales from our group that way. The early arrivals would have happily ordered mimosas and other Sunday beverages while we waited, however; once the party arrived, the goal became ""eat brunch and get going with the site seeing"" and not ""relax and catch up over a beverage while we wait"". That dinged the potential sales a bit.Once everyone arrived we were seated quite quickly at a table in the back of the quaint restaurant.  We all tried a variety of omelettes, french toast concoctions and other treats, and everyone left full and happy. The eggs were light and fluffy in the omelettes, and the croissants and preserves were absolutely amazing. The fat, fluffy french toast with strawberries and the apple banana french toast were sweet without being cloying, and came with an enormous side of eggs and toast with preserves. I had the farmer's omelette but made a mental note to come back and try the french toast and the lemon ricotta pancakes.Our waitress was just the right amount of attentive, making sure we were hydrated and happy, and that my niece (the baby) had plenty of crayons and other things to occupy her attention.  She even made sure the not-so-mature adults at our table (read: all of us) had crayons as well if we wanted.The noise level was a little high, but not overwhelming, and actually worked well to mask the noise of the high number of babies and toddlers scattered around the room with the TriBeCa mommies out for brunch dates with their friends. The space didn't feel crowded at all - a plus since there was a line out the door that started shortly after we were seated. Calling ahead was definitely the right move to avoid waiting.Overall, I'd definitely go back for another brunch.",0,0,0,Leslie P.,"Portland, OR",73,76,10

4.0,5/26/2013,"Came here last weekend; I live in Battery Park City, had never been, but my friend's mom was in town, so it was an opportune time to come.  They said that there was going to be a 15 minute wait, but when I met up with my party, there was a table waiting for us, presumably because it was cloudy/ready-to-rain, and Taste of Tribeca was happening that day, so the locals had other food options.  The decor inside is light and the interior space is laid out in such a way that you wouldn't feel like you are on top of one another.  We opted to sit outside despite the weather.  Since I'd heard good things about the Lemon and Ricotta Pancakes, I finally settled on them, after debating between ordering them or the Almond Crusted French Toast (which, luckily my friend's mom ordered).  While I normally go eggy versus pancake-y at brunch, I am glad I chose the latter.  The pancakes were light and fluffy, and the subtlety of the lemon enhanced the well-interspersed bits of ricotta.  I did ""help"" my friend's mom finish her almond french toast - there were 4 or 5 half-slices.  The toasted almonds were crispy, and added a lovely flavor to the well-prepared french toast.  I didn't use the accompanying compote because all they needed was a bit of syrup.  As a side, I ordered the Chicken and Apple Breakfast Sausage, and I think that my own recent tendency to stay away from meat made me a bit more critical - I could taste the apple chunks, but they seemed a bit salty to me (compared to the chicken and apple sausage I had picked up for a barbecue from Amish Market).  And I think that pan-frying versus grilling also had something to do with it.The most standout moment, though, was around the beverage service.  I ordered the Bloody Mary ($14), and thought the pickled vegetables were a nice touch, however, I found it to be unremarkable (having had some great Bloody Marys all over the city); it was lacking in flavor, overwhelmingly tasted of tomato, and there was no horseradish, black pepper, worcestershire sauce, and needed more salt.  I ordered a Mimosa instead and told our waiter that he could take it off the table.  He asked if there was a problem with the drink, and I gave my candid yet diplomatic assessment of what was missing.  When he brought the bill out, he said that they had taken care of it (as in, taken it off  the bill), which was a pleasant surprise, since I was fully prepared to pay for it - I am not one of those patrons who expects something to be taken off the bill simply becauseI didn't care for the taste.  That impressed me enough that I am definitely coming back.",1,0,0,Judy V.,"New York, NY",387,21,0

The crab cake had huge pieces of fresh crab and seasoned well, very good. The french fries were light and crispy not heavy and greasy, and the fresh greens served were drizzled in yummy dressing. My friend ordered the Almond Crusted French Toast and it didn't taste that great. Didn't have any true flavor. The ambiance of the restaurant was spacious, open, and homey.

I, however, liked that about Sarabeth's since it got me ready to take on a Saturday in the city.For my meal, I opted for the Goldie Lox - egg whites with lox, minus the cream cheese. The portion was huge, the eggs were perfectly cooked, and the plate was almost overflowing with lox. They certainly didn't skimp on the smoked salmon! Being that the salmon was the reason I ordered the dish in the first place, this made for one extremely pleased diner. The eggs are served with your choice of starch, and I'm never one to turn down a bran muffin so that was my pick. This might have been the best bran muffin I've had. Ever. It was buttery and soft, with a slightly crunchy top... I could have eaten a plate of those muffins and been more than satisfied. In fact, I could really go for one right now.And what's a brunch without alcoholic bevs? I ordered a bloody mary, extra spicy. Sadly, it wasn't actually that spicy - or spicy at all, really.

3.0,2/20/2013,"Review is for the brunch.  The good: Great neighborhood with lots of shopping, bars and other restaurants around.  And the building itself: beautiful 5 story that has been redone impeccably.  Sarabeths is huge, so if you are looking for an intimate feel, probably head somewhere else.  Also, it has kind of a diner feel (not in a bad way, but should be noted).  So if you are looking for something particularly ""nice"", maybe another spot.  The menu is huge for brunch.  I particularly like that you can get any of their many omeletes as egg whites.  Great option for the health conscious.  Also, tons of other things to choose from on the menu.  The bad: The service is really spotty in here and it gets waaaay to crowded.. almost claustrophobic.  The sides of turkey sausage felt like it just came out of a microwave and was dried out.  Omelete and granola bowl was good.  Basically a decent option for a lunch or a brunch, particularly with a group.  Not for dinner.",0,0,0,Raymond G.,"Petworth, Washington, DC",159,119,7

I have walked by a bunch of times never realizing it is actually ~1/2 the block. There is a front room with a lot of windows/sunlight and then an inner room and a back room that seemed to be sealable for private parties (had a projector as well). Since it's winter all the strollers that are typically parked on the street were in the vestibule. Nice Sunday brunch vibe.The Food:- Guacamole & Chips - Guac hit the spot and the chips were deep fried and crispy. Only problem was there was so much guac and so few chips that we needed to ask for extra chips twice in order to get through most of the dish (no additional charge).- Muffins and Jam - An assortment of muffins and jams. Really good and easy to share with the table (cut each in bite sized fourths)- Fat and Fluffy French Toast - possibly the best order of them all. waiter agreed it was the best of the numerous french toast options- Eggs Benedict - came on their muffins, big hit (although a lot of muffin)- Fritata - the manchego sold me on it, but did not live up to the quality of the other dishes. Was good but would not order again.- Sides: bacon and fries were both crispy- Bloody Mary - a signature cocktail and served in a glass the size of 2 goblets -- was HUGE, and a big hit.I still prefer Bubby's, but this is not a bad second for the area -- especially considering they take reservations.",0,0,0,Jason H.,"Manhattan, NY",11,105,0
3.0,2/3/2013,"Came here for Sunday brunch with my mom who was in from out of town. I ordered the Goldie lox with a scone, my mom got the chorizo fritatta with the berry corn muffin and we split a side of the home fries and we each shared half each others so we could taste everything. Our food came out in what felt like 2.5 seconds after we ordered it, which is a good thing when you're really hungry I guess.The scrambled eggs were good and I loved the salty salmon and the cream cheese but who does't? The frittatta was also decent but I almost wish the chorizo wasn't so finely diced so you could taste it a little better. The home fries were also good and weren't super greasy but I would have preferred them a little more crispy and well done but that's really just a personal preference and I probably should have requested the potatoes well done. My scone was so yummy and was dotted with currants and nice and soft and went really well with the preserves. My mom's berry corn muffin was delish as well although maybe just a TAD on the dry side but I happily still ate it and would have eaten another if they offered it.We both also got coffee which was hot and strong and they were good about refilling it. Overall we both enjoyed our food but to be perfectly honest, I think we both could have been very happy to go and order a pastry basket and just eaten that as it was our favorite parts for both of us.",0,0,0,Megan B.,"Manhattan, NY",1,8,0

Anytime anyone ever visits NY, they want to go to Sarabeth's. I was pretty excited when one opened up in Tribeca as I had been waiting several years to go to this amazing brunch spot... Unfortunately, I don't think I'm sold. Don't get me wrong - it is definitely not bad. It's actually pretty decent. But is it one of the best brunches I've had? No. Was it that memorable? Not really. When I dined there, I had their eggs and porridge. The eggs tasted like any other eggs I've had in the city. The porridge was interesting. It came with milk, honey and strawberries. The honey and strawberries definitely gave it a little bit more flavor. But maybe I'm just not a fan of porridge.

The crunch of the bacon, the creaminess of the avocado and egg yolks balanced beautifully with the greens and dressing.I also got to sample the french toast which was cooked to fluffy and amazing perfection.

3.0,12/26/2012,"I've heard about this brunch chain a few times - usually while walking around with a friend and deciding where we should have brunch. ""Let's try Sarabeth's"" is usually accompanied by ""It is supposed to be amazing!"" but also ""There will be a long wait"" and ""Maybe another time."" However this past Sunday, on a friend's birthday weekend, we made reservations at the Sarabeth's in Tribeca and went there.The ambience had a nice, lively Sunday brunch vibe with white walls, the smell of eggs and coffee, tables ordering a drink, or two, happy servers and lots of conversations. Our group contrasted with swollen eyes and headaches, thanks to the previous night out in celebration of our friend's birthday. However, that quickly changed once our coffees arrived! My mocha latte was a little too bitter for my liking, however I suspect that is because they add two shots (instead of the 1 that I am used to) of espresso. I prefer my mocha to be chocolatey and sweet with a hint of espresso instead of the other way around. Nontheless, I was able to enjoy some of it.My food made up for the coffee. I ordered salmon eggs benedict, which came with a side salad and was just delicious! Honestly, I love salmon and eggs, so I don't see how they could have messed this up, but it was great anyway. My friends ordered waffles, pancakes, fries and omlettes all of which were great. Besides, our little round table in the corner allowed for an intimate setting in a lively brunch place.I would definitely repeat Sarabeth's when searching for a good brunch place - but only after making a reservation.

2.0,10/7/2012,"meh is the word to describe this place for sure. slow service and overpriced, lukewarm food. a basically underwhelming brunch experience. there are far, far better places in Manhattan and Queens for tasty, decently priced brunch options. such a shame since the space seemed very lovely: large, open and clean minimalist decor. we had a large party of 20+ people for a friend's b-day brunch party, so I understand that a wait for entrees is to be expected, but timing was ridiculous. not only did we wait close to an hour for food, but three of the people in our party (two had ordered pancakes and the third had ordered a burger) got their food over half an hour after the rest of our table had already received their entrees. the waiter did offer them a complimentary basket of muffins, but seriously, their meal should have been comped for how long they had to wait for their food. as one person joked, what are they doing, killing the cow for your burger? many of the dishes at our table already arrived cold to lukewarm. a few people ordered the steak and frites upon the server's rec, but many complained that the steak was too dry and tasted as if they had been under a heat lamp for awhile. i ordered the farmer's omelette, which was tasty for what it was (leeks, potato, ham, cheese), but I was not very impressed with size and temperature (lukewarm). for the omelets, you have your choice of a muffin, scone or toast. of course, they had pumpkin muffins (love love pumpkin-flavored anything), so of course I chose that option. the muffin itself was fine but like everything else, it arrived cold. i would not return. $14.50 for a lukewarm omelet and $4 for a cup of coffee was too much.

I do not ususally venture downtown for meals but was pleased to see how cute the neighborhood was. The outside of the restuarant had a spacious area for outdoor seating, not the usual manhattan outdoor seating in which you are sitting on top of each other. But, because we were a large group we decided it would be easier to sit inside. It was a wonderful spacious, light, room. The restaurant was so simpliy decorated and the windows were so vast that in itself was the perfect deor. Understated yet elegant. It was a luncheon and the menu for that time of day consisted of brunch. I wide variety of both breakfast and lunch options. We each ordered our own individual meal and chose a bunch of sharing plates. I got the eggs benedicts which was delicious, and just like the ambiance, the food too was delicious yet understated. The hollandaise sauce was lighter than I had ever had before, and was very pleased. The baked mac and cheese with broccoli was out of this world. The tomato soup, was the best I've ever had and I'm not even usually a fan of tomato soup. I shared it which was a good idea because it was a very creamy dish and could have been a meal on its on. The Bloody Mary was a presentation on its own, topped with all sorts of shredded veggies. The service was exceptional, except for one meal that came out ten minutes later than the rest, but once it arrived it was certainly worth the wait.  The only complaint I had was that the majority of the people eating in the restuarant were adults with their young, and loud, children.

I ordered their lemon ricotta pancakes from the brunch menu and also sampled the French toast with fresh strawberries.   Lemon ricotta pancakes were fluffily prepared and had a slight zesty taste, but I could not taste the ricotta at all.  Perhaps ricotta adds to the fluffiness?  Whatever its purpose was, it was not very evident to me.  Also tried my friend's order of the French Toast with fresh strawberries: uh-may-zing.  It was filling, but didn't leave me feeling heavy.  Tasted GREAT.  I think they actually make the French toast using challah bread.  Order the French toast, you won't regrets it!Our server was very smart and friendly - made herself available without constantly checking up on us.  It was as though she could read our minds when we needed something.Sarabeth's offers a cozy environment that is busy without patrons feeling the rush.  Everyone is engaged in pleasant conversations and I did not see any unhappy faces here.  The inside is actually much larger than the exterior makes it out to be.  They offer al fresco dining that looks like it would be a lot of fun when it isn't muggy/humid out.  Great brunch experience that I cannot wait to repeat!",2,1,1,Crystine W.,"New York, NY",773,1215,283

Despite all the bad reviews, i have to say sarabeth tribeca is pretty good. you can taste the quality of the ingredients they used in their dishes, which are very well put together. The space itself is spacious and have an inviting feel, and it's generally pretty busy on sundays; but since it's a big place, it's not a horrendous waiting affair you'd find at clinton st or norma's. Just the kind of a laid back place you would hope to find in tribeca. I definitely recommend this place.",0,0,0,Martin L.,"Brooklyn, NY",29,147,1

Overall was pretty standard mealMy friends omelette did look very goodOne thing that I was a huge fan of was the fact that I am biased because I love Tribeca and because I work in WFC, and there are truly not many places where you can just come in and eat a nice lunch or dinner...everything is either to bourgeois or to casual.....I will probably be coming back here soon",1,0,1,Leo K.,"Brooklyn, NY",240,443,483

4.0,7/12/2012,"I recently visited Sarabeth's near Central Park and I had a good experience, so when I saw there was a Sarabeth down in Tribeca i decided to reward myself for having undergone a hellish workout in the morning with a nice brunch.  I was a bit worried that Sarabeth's would make me wait some crazy amount of time but I was seated right away, and at a comfortable table to boot!Sarabeth's Tribeca is much larger than its Central Park sibling.  There are four key seating areas.  There's the bar, the area behind the bar (where I sat) and off to the left is another.  Then walk towards the rest rooms and there's another seating area deeper in the restaurant.  What I appreciated was how spread out the seating was.  The one by Central Park is in a smaller space and is a bit crowded for my tastes.  This one had plenty of room and felt wide open and welcoming.The decor is similar to its sibling restaurant, with liberal use of bright colors to give it a friendly and shiny appearance. I felt instantly at ease as soon as I walked in and the comfortable seat I sat in really helped me settle in.  My waiter came over very quickly and took my order with the zeal of a pro and disappeared to put it in.  So what did I get?BABY BEAR PORRIDGE (with milk and honey)This serving of porridge was about a cup and a half, hot, fresh and sent out with a couple strawberries in the middle.  Honey is provided off to the side and I drizzled it on liberally.  It was creamy, delicious and had some nice chewy bits that reminded me of Irish oatmeal.  Wonderfully comforting!GARDEN OMELETTE (mushroom, green peas, zucchini, cheddar cheese)I meant to order this with egg whites but wound up with a regular one.  Oh, what is one to do?  I ate it of course!  The veggies were very finely chopped, which I found pleasant and different than most omelettes where the veggies are generally wilted greens or chunky.  The cheese was super tasty and the eggs were light and fluffy. On the side was a choice of toast or a muffin.  If you're going to do Sarabeth's, you do a muffin along with their soft butter and preserve.  I opted for the pumpkin muffin.  I had expected a tiny mini-muffin, but nope, this was a good medium sized muffin topped with pumpkin seeds and full of flavor.  PORK SAUSAGE (with apricot preserve)The pork sausage side would have been tasty enough on it's own, but with the apricot preserve?  It was heavenly!  The sweet/salty combination reminded me of having roast pork from a Chinese place with Duck sauce.  This was a bit less ""clobber you over the head"" and more ""this is a VERY delicious combination1""Sarabeth is a fantastic brunch spot.  I'd recommend it to anyone looking for a modern, comfortable and classy environment with tons of good food!",2,2,2,Benson Y.,"New York, NY",393,1300,917
5.0,7/1/2012,"Came here for brunch on a weekend and was extremely satisfied with the service, ambiance and food.Was a little hesitant given the mixed Yelp reviews but ultimately found nothing amiss during our Sat brunch.  I made a reservation on OpenTable and we were seating promptly at 12:30.  Our server greeted us, was very friendly, took and brought over our Bloody Marys in a matter of minutes and was attentive throughout the entire meal.  The Bloody Marys were excellent.  Some of the best I've had in a long time (except for maybe Prune), served with a heap of sweet and tart pickled veggies and in a generously large glass.  Filled to the brim with tomato spiciness, they were perfect and surprisingly strong and $12.I ordered Farmer's Omelet with a scone and T ordered the Garden Omelet with a pumpkin muffin.  Both came out steaming hot and fluffy with sides of Sarabeth's signature marmalade.  Each bite of the Farmer's Omelet was a nice blend of ham and cheese with a hint of leeks.  On the rich side, but delicious.  My scone was dotted with currants and was soft and warm, perfect slathered with butter and preserves.T's Garden Omelet was bursting with peas, zucchini and mushrooms and was light and fluffy yet moist all at the same time.  The only complaint I had (though tiny) was that the Pumpkin Muffin, while wonderfully flavored, was a little dry.  But with butter, the muffin was perfect.  Both omelets were large and very reasonable for $14.We were able to leisurely enjoy our brunch and were not rushed out in any way by our waitress.  When signaled, she brought the check promptly and we floated out on the door on a cloud of brunch perfection :)  I will definitely be back.",1,1,1,Jenn E.,"Seattle, WA",250,369,140

Unfortunately, this one did not live up to our expectations.The atmosphere was nice but the noise level was awful. My boyfriend and I couldn't carry a conversation because we could barely hear each other from across the table. Our waitress also had a hard time hearing us and taking our orders.When the food came it was nothing like we expected. I got the Salmon Eggs Benedict, which came in a giant plate with two-thirds of it covered in a salad with barely any dressing. The salmon was extremely salty, the biscuit was more of a muffin bottom, and the hollandaise sauce tasted like nothing. To make matters worse, the egg had egg shells in it and my plate was covered in dried flour on the bottom. My boyfriend got the Goldie Lox which was just as salty but at least his muffin was good.My boyfriend also ordered a cup of coffee and when our waitress gave it to him she forgot to give him a stirring spoon. We tried to get a waiter's attention but nobody was coming by so we had to wait until people were seated next to us before we got any service.

Unfortunately, Sarabeth's TriBeCa has not lived up to its potential in this new location.  It's not that the food isn't good, it's decent.  6.8 out of 10, it's edible.  But the combination of it being grossly overpriced, the menu lacking creativity, and the food tasting like it came from a midtown manhattan chipotle kitchen (sorry, chipotle) - it just isn't worth it anymore.

The egg dishes are bland, poorly prepared (very little cheese which wasn't even melted) and starkly presented. The baked goods are much better than the entrees, but numerous NYC bakery's (ex-bouley, balthazar) put them to shame. The staff doesn't have the common sense to coral all the kids into one of the many rooms, making the entire restaurant feel like romper-room (I have 2 kids, but when i go out, i should have the option of a peaceful meal). The best item on the menu is the four flower juice ($6) which my waiter forgot, but still included on the bill. Of course, this bland breakfast runs $12-15 for eggs and $4 for a basic cup of coffee!!! Do yourself a favor, and walk down to locanda verde for a great breakfast at these prices.

4.0,10/16/2011,"Sarabeth's in all its New York locations exhibits a regression to the mean for its Yelp ratings--a half and three stars.  However, something so dangerously close to my home deserves a modest upgrade, and hence my solid four-star review and rating.The Tribeca location replaced the Bazzini store in a magnificent space with vaulted ceilings, housed on the ground floor of the 125-year old Bazzini Building.  The products and services have a New England feel to them, but the patrons at this location are primarily young families from the neighborhood, most with their collection of 1-3 kids in strollers.  Lunch time and weekends are especially busy.  Interesting people-watching, if you are into that sort of thing.Sarabeth herself is a self-appointed legend in the fruit preserves market.  In addition to the jams, Sarabeth's sells cookies, cakes and beverages.  However, the kitchen is best equipped to serve breakfast and brunch.  The oatmeal is hearty and well done, and cleverly labeled as baby/mama/papa bear, not to forget the extreme version that is named big bad wolf.  The basket of muffins and preserves would constitute a heavy breakfast for two, but not a particularly healthy one.  My absolute favorite is the lemon and ricotta pancakes with berries.The variety of choices for lunch and dinner ranges from guacamole and chips to stone-oven pizza and pasta.

Walking into Sarabeths you can't help but notice all of the white and all of the space, yet it reminds you nothing of a hospital, in fact for such a large space it gives off such an inviting feel. We went for an early supper and there were plenty of seats available. The hostess let us pick what area we wanted to be seated as well as which exact table. The bread basket was on our table within seconds (we asked for a second basket, we couldn't get enough). The staff was so attentive, maybe even too attentive, ""is everything OK"" every other minute. I am sure it was only because it was a slow time of day and the place is relatively new (they were still very pleasant and helpful). The prices are right, plenty of choices on the menu (but not too many to overwhelm the mind), and the taste is exactly how I like it. Calamari comes with garlic sauce, at first you miss the classic red sauce and then really start to enjoy the garlic sauce so much you need bread for it. The mini cheeseburgers come with Gruyere cheese (a sign of a great establishment). The pizza is made from a stove oven, if you are with 3 or 4 people you could also order one as an appetizer for a small taste that will leave you wanting more. The scallops in lobster broth with gnocchi were unbelievable. The jumbo lump crab spaghetti was generously filled with fresh crab pieces that were sure to leave any seafood lover like me wanting more. I have yet to try dessert or breakfast from this place, I have heard all great things from others.

The perfect opportunity came when my co-workers wanted to do a working girls lunch...I enthusiastically recommended Sarabeth's, which had just opened up down the street from our office in TriBeCa.Based on what other Yelpers had written, I knew I had to get the creamy tomato soup despite the $9 price tag. This was definitely the highlight of the meal. Served in a fairly large bowl, it's VERY creamy (almost a bit too much for my palate) and has actual tomato chunks in it along with some melted cheese - delish!For my entrée, I decided to get the chicken pot pie ($17) solely because I had seen one Yelper's picture he/she had posted and it looked so darn delicious. True to what the picture had shown, the presentation of the pot pie was beautiful. However, the dish itself was just meh. Starting with the first bite where I burned my tongue because it was scalding, the dish just went downhill from there. The chicken and the gravy weren't particularly flavorful and I had to add lots of salt and pepper in order to give it some oomph. Also, the small round thin-sliced potatoes in the dish didn't seem like they had cooked all the way through as they were a bit hard. The one saving grace of this dish was the pastry topping itself, which was very buttery and chewy. I found myself trying to desperately scrape off the bits that had stuck to the dish and was disappointed there was no bottom crust. To be fair, I did try a bite of what my friends were having and very much enjoyed the pumpkin waffle as well as the berry corn muffin, although the stuffed egg popover also seemed meh.  Props for serving their breakfast menu items until 3:30 PM.

My date told me that this place opened recently and I am always ready to try something new. We arrived on a hot, summery night and immediately I noticed that this place was big and breezy. The place is spacious and warm. The walls are white and with cozy New England decor. The hostess was able to seat us immediately. As soon as we sat down, the waitress for the table next to us spilled wine all over the gentleman's back. It was pretty embarassing to witness this, but the guy took it well. He didn't get mad and was really nice about it. This was to foreshadow the service for the rest of the evening. The service was absolutely abyssmal. I understand that they just opened, so I am willing to cut them some slack, but really, it took them forever to get us some water and the place was half-empty. My friend ordered a cobb salad and wanted to substitute blue cheese for gruyere. The waitress was clueless. She did not know what gruyere was. That's a no-no. We had mussels in saffron curry and matchstick fries as an appetizer and it was flavorful and the sauce was easily scooped up by the complimentary bread. I recommend the mussels. I was in the mood for the roasted halibut and the waitress said she might be able to get me the last order, but alas, it was 86'd. So I settled for sauteed vegetables with pine nuts and polenta. It was a letdown. The vegetables were fresh, but the polenta was so bland. The truly outstanding dish was the dessert. If you come here, definitely get the bread pudding.
