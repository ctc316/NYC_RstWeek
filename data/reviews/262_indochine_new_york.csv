1.0,4/15/2019,We were next-door to see a show and decided to eat there before the show started and were told that we have to wait until 530 if we didn't have reservations. Hostess had a major attitude. Food was supposed to be specially prepared without spices but wasn't and no one checked to see if food was ok for me to  eat because I have stomach issues. Never saw anyone after we got food except to get our check. We were charged 105 for food that only one person could eat. Left restaurant hungry as I couldn't eat anything. Very disappointed. Would give zero if I could. Note. There is NO French food on menu.,0,0,0,Katrina S.,"Fairfax, VA",24,25,3
5.0,4/13/2019,Love this restaurant!!  Food is always good and ambience is great. Not too loud but not too quiet. Great for casual night out. Every dish is fantastic and great for sharing. I always love the duck. Hard to order wrong here. Never been disappointed. And it's not terribly hard to get a reservation but I would always get a reservation. Not a walk in kinda place.,0,0,0,Patrick S.,"New York, NY",1,15,0
3.0,3/20/2019,Been coming here since it opened. The dishes are hit and miss. The crispy red snapper is fun. Green beans side dish was excellent. But their was a human hair in the chicken entree. I never know if that is a serious health risk. I suspect not but it is off putting. And the chicken was not great. Service is ...gorgeous and has been fit at least 35 ye,0,0,0,Daniel G.,"Weston, CT",8,185,26
4.0,2/24/2019,Absolutely delicious and I highly recommend it.  I really don't understand why it's rated at 3 1/2 stars.  I'm my opinion the food alone is definitely over 4 stars. Absolutely no complaints and loved every single bite of my food.  Service was great as it was not over whelming by trying to be too good .  Perfect venue for a fun date or a midsize get together.,0,0,0,Michael L.,"Manhasset, NY",31,83,375
5.0,2/20/2019,"Indochine is such a trendy and cool spot. It has palm leaves lining the wall and is dimly lit with red lights, very exotic 80's theme. If you go between 5:30-7 or so they have a pre-theater menu which is definitely the best value for your buck, even though it doesn't have the more traditional Vietnamese dishes like pho. However, still very delicious and flavorful. For appetizers, we ordered the spicy squid and spring rolls. Presentation is definitely A+ here. For our entree, we ordered the spicy chicken and sizzling beef which comes in a hot flat plate. Definitely get the sticky rice, it's the type of rice that you find wrapped in banana leaves for the autumn festival. So much flavor and made the meal so savory. The desserts weren't anything I would say is super special and unique but it still was delicious. We had the chocolate mousse cake and the lemon tart, both very rich and sweet. I would 100% come back to eat again as the restaurant was comfortable and spacious and the food is jam-packed with all the flavors I like.",0,0,1,Sarah C.,"New York, NY",396,144,193

Dimmed lights and a nice cozy yet trendy atmosphere in NoHo, on La Fayette- it can get a bit loud inside.Dishes were served. We ordered fried sticky rice, their famous spring rolls, and the marinated beef, well done. Everything was delicious and tasted fresh. Our mixed drinks were also the perfect combo, although I can't remember what we ordered lol.

4.0,2/14/2019,Came here for a birthday party with a massive group of people. We were super loud and rowdy and for that they handled us so well in terms of the service. All the staff was super kind and well receiving considering we were what anyone else would call a nightmare. They seated us in the back which was smart for the other customers of the restaurant. We also were not rushed out past our reservation time only asked to leave when the next party for our table arrived. Which was very nice and accommodating. Our food was also good. It was nothing expectional and I don't think i would come here for a great meal but it was a great place to celebrate a birthday.,0,0,0,Eda O.,"Los Angeles, CA",268,40,13
1.0,2/11/2019,Terrible service; unimpressive food. This place thinks it is too good for its customers. They kept us waiting for our reserved table for an hour. There are better places that cost less and have a better atmosphere. Don't bother. Go somewhere else.,0,0,0,Lynn M.,"Encinitas, CA",24,24,0
3.0,2/5/2019,"Not at all French Vietnamese. Just plain Vietnamese. I mean, sure, France occupied Vietnam and a lot of their food is inspired from France, but this restaurant should be tagged as just plain Vietnamese food. Maybe American-Vietnamese food, because the food here was nothing close to authentic Vietnamese. The fresh rolls - the skin was way too thick. I've been to budget-hole-in-the-wall Vietnamese restaurants with better fresh rolls. The sauce as good though. The fried fish - it was ok. The fish was fried well (good enough to eat part of the tail) but the sauce lacked salt. It was very sweet. We ordered a couple of other things but I can't remember because this is a late post! The place is a see and be seen type of place, it seems. So if you want to socialize, etc, this place works. But if you want authentic Vietnamese food, look elsewhere. The servers are all gorgeous, and everyone dresses well. I used to like this sort of thing when I was single and younger. But I guess now that I'm married with a kid, and I hardly get out to eat, maybe this place wasn't the one for me.",0,0,0,Danni I.,"New York, NY",50,79,189
5.0,2/4/2019,"Dining here is like going back in a time machine. Or, tripping out on mushrooms. Ever see that movie, The Birdcage? The vibe coming in here reminds me of that movie, minus the drag queens performing & Miami. Although this themed restaurant seems misplaced from jump, once you have a couple of drinks & scope out the scene, you realize its exactly where it's supposed to be. And, you're nothing, but a squirrel in their world. The food is good, solid Asian fashion fusion, & nothing spectacular. Expensive for what it is, but good. Reference attached pics of what me and my basic batches dined on. The service is a combo of forced pleasantry, indifference & too cool for school, minus the dickish tude, from non career type servers who all "" look"" like something straight out of central casting. The drinks, at the bar anyway, were strong AF. The bar is way too small & in an awkward space, btw. If they expanded it, I'd probs hang here more often. I pretty much was drunk on gin martinis. Someone told me once a lady never orders the third martini. Obviously, I'm no lady. Coming here is really about the vibe and the scene. I highly recommend trying to scoop up one of the half moon booths, as opposed to a table. It's a great spot for people watching & to impress your basic batch(es). Ok, that's all I got.",10,8,9,Your Moms B.,"New York, NY",98,412,3437
4.0,1/29/2019,"Indochine was a special surprise, elevating what is Vietnamese cuisine, or at least Vietnamese-French fusion. I ate at the restaurant with my colleagues for our tiny holiday party on Tuesday, December 11 at 7 p.m.We ordered bottles of wine for the table, as well as appetizers. The appetizers were good enough that if there were more on a plate I would have been content with those as a meal. There was generally enough for everyone at our table of six to have one piece or a bit of each appetizer. Some, however, came as five pieces. Service was attentive, and we were never left without water or wine, and never were we bothered by overly attentive servers.I had the seafood bouillabaisse. It was amazing. The flavor profile was along the lines of a Vietnamese dish, with coconut milk broth, some spice, and hints of ginger and lemongrass. It was so great, however, the dish was over salted. A seafood dish like this really doesn't need additional salt. Perhaps it came from a condensed canned curry chili paste. I hope they can work this dish out. Reducing the salt, will bump it up to a five star dish from four in my book.For dessert, I had the coconut creme brulee. It was also phenomenal. It tasted well-crafted and home made, devoid of artificial flavoring, and had a perfect toasted top, not too think and not overly darkened.The overall ambience of Indochine is busy and vibrant, but some will perceive this is loud and chaotic. Rather than rich punks and artists coming in (like the Warhol type), it seems there are more model-types dining. While the food is unbelievably good and the service meets guests' needs without intrusion, I wouldn't recommend this place for a romantic date or first date. There's just too much going on in terms of an over stimulating environment. But if that's your thing, you'll love it. I would go here again simply for the food, it's that good.",0,0,0,Rosie W.,"Cliffside Park, NJ",0,16,0
4.0,1/29/2019,"It's restaurant week, you know what that means! I was excited when my friend told me that this place was participating in restaurant week and I wanted to try it! The pre-fix menu definitely featured some of their top dishes off the main menu. The lychee martini was AMAZING and so fresh and lemony (not sweet). We started with the crunchy spring rolls. These were the best spring rolls I have ever had! You wrap them in lettuce and dip in a delicious orange thai sauce, it was perfect! We also recieved the ""ravioli"" which was chopped up chicken and shrimp and veggies wrapped in a rice paper roll. Then we ordered the spicy chicken with white sticky rice, the salmon with jasmine rice, and the Chilean sea bass. My favorite dish would be the salmon or the spicy chicken (not spicy at all). The sticky rice was just white rice where as the jasmine rice looked more similar to fried rice. The deserts were nothing special, the sorbet was, well sorbet, and the tart was decent however, I am not a fan of tarts. The only bad thing we experienced was there was some grey ~unknown~ substance on our lettuce and when we notified the waiter he apologized and we never heard another word about it, very strange. This is a place celebrities frequent! Tory Burch and Cindy Crawford were there that week as well.",1,0,1,Alexis M.,"New York, NY",261,177,375
3.0,1/26/2019,I found this place to be very underwhelming. Food was good but forgettable at best. Nothing stood out as the best thing nor something I would want to order again. We had a reservation. We were sat 45 mins after that reservation. We were seated close to closing time and by the end of the meal we felt rushed by the servers.

4.0,12/26/2018,"I'm not surprised that I'd find myself at this kind of restaurant on the 25th of December, but I am surprised to see that this place was basically packed to the brim on this particular Christmas night. I'm happy my friend ended up making reservations in advance because if not there would've been no way we'd end up getting seated.After arriving we ordered some drinks at the bar while waiting for out table to be prepared. After we were notified that it was we were able to bring our drinks to the table and given given time to look over the menu.One of the first few things I noticed when walking into this restaurant were the wall paper decorations and the atmosphere of the space. Dimly lit with large cat palm plants set throughout the restaurant it gave off a tropical romantic feel which seems ideal for a special date night.When it came time to order I stuck with the pho ($15) option they had. Sliced beef, rice noodles, and bean sprouts made for the perfect combination of the classic Vietnamese dish. The service here was also pretty good. Our waiter gave us ample time to look over the menu, filled our water glasses frequently, and brought out our food in a timely manner. Nothing more you could've asked for.Given the price point and the atmosphere I'd categorize this as a special date night option. I've had more filling pho elsewhere for half the price, but the service and decor make up for what you loose in your dish (for pho that is). Apparently the cocktails are pretty remarkable as well.",1,0,0,Nicholas C.,"Upper West Side, Manhattan, NY",240,247,698
2.0,12/5/2018,I generally like my restaurants to be brighter and less crowded. The table we sat at was wedged between 2 other tables and so close together that everyone would need to get up and pull the table out in order for the people inside to use the restroom. Food presentation was nice but unfortunately the duck breast I ordered was overly salty and overcooked. The skirt steak and pea shoots were very good though.

They had a combination of all their dishes from the beef ribs, the young chicken and the salmon. With dessert. Ribs were excellent, would highly recommend, chicken superb.  Salmon good and the desserts were solid for sure.

And it's loud as fuck, louder than most of the cocktail bars I go to and it's a fuckin restaurant.

We couldn't hear a word any of us were saying!And the food was mediocre, but worse than that-worse than anything-was the service. There are 2 tall thin model-esque girls wearing ball gowns, sauntering at the front, but not speaking a word. Awful. No matre'd, no manager, no one who cared. And the table service was the same.

3.0,9/25/2018,"Very unimpressed with Indochine. This place has tacky aesthetic aiming to be trendy. You will notice the decor with flamingos and plants painted all over the restaurant while the tables are white cloth. I think if they planned their design a little better, it'd make up for the tacky interior. Indochine is a decent place to grab drinks or come with work colleagues. It is spacious so you won't have trouble fitting in a lot of people -- it's a safe spot to suggest for large crowds. The food and drinks are just par but it is pricey. We each got two wines and the drink bill alone was north of a 100. I don't mind steep bills, but I expect the ambiance and service to be on par with the quality of food and drinks. The service was hardly attentive. The restaurant was not at all busy but it took an oddly amount to get the bartender's attention.

Don't miss the crispy whole red snapper and the sticky rice studded with diced baby shrimp and Vietnamese sausage.

It has the ambience down pat and makes you feel trendy just being inside, surrounded by all the leafy fern paintings and greenery. Appropriately, everyone who works here also seems to be beautiful, like we are talking legitimately modelesque. The food was good and up to par, if not outstanding. We heard the baby back ribs were a must try so of course we ordered that, along with the shaking beef, glazed duck breast, and several cocktails. Each entree came with a side of white or sticky rice, of which the latter was more like fried sticky rice with shrimp and pork. Verdicts: The ribs were indeed awesome but also insanely salty. The shaking beef was good though not memorable. Duck breast - actually pretty amazing, order it. Cocktails were hit or miss; if you like fruity drinks, definitely get the lychee saketini.All in all - Indochine isn't a destination for the food, but you probably knew that already.

There was some dimension and flavor notes in the spring rolls and the sticky rice which came with the salmon but the fish tasted undercooked and there was a lack of flavor.

The ribs tasted like 4 dried out day-old  bones slathered with sauce  and without a suggestion of the rich, juicy flavors I expected. The Spicy shrimp were bland & lacked any hint of heat while served in a watery sauce. The waitress condescended to explain that tastes vary and perhaps I was unable to taste Properly. And of course her response to my complaint was that she had the dish several times and she thought it was spicy in disagreement with my experience as if to prove her ridiculous defense.  Just plain Stupid.   The sautéed pea pods were un-chewable and left stringy strands that I am still picking out of my teeth. Each dish was also over-salted. There were no condiments on the table, say chili paste, to add heat to dishes as was needed. Table turnover was high and service  seemed rushed.

2.0,7/24/2018,"I went here many years ago for restaurant week, and our waitress was rude and argumentative the entire time. One of the items on the menu was the tuna, and she asked how I wanted it cooked. I said rare. She said, we don't really recommend that, the rarest we go is medium rare. I said I wanted it rare and I am fine with it being cooked that way, and she refused to let me order it at that temperature. After a few back and forth rounds I relented and got the tuna medium rare. While waiting for our food, I then saw other plates being brought out with the tuna, and it was swimming in a suspicious looking sauce. I'm not the most adventurous eater, so I then asked the waitress if I could have my tuna served without any sauce on it. She said, in a condescending tone, ""you mean the broth? I'll have to check with the chef, that's how it's served"". She finally came back and said to me that the chef was ""ok with preparing the tuna that way"". And the tuna came out and it was delicious, and not soggy at all, because...guess what? there was no sauce muddling up the flavors! Also, the appetizer, if you can call it that, of venison carpaccio, was one very thin square of raw vension, less than the size of a Post-it Note. Delicious, but teeny tiny.

4.0,4/27/2018,"Indochine is the type of place where you expect to find celebrities dining--or just fashionable old guys with skinny models on their arm. But in either case, the snobbish ambience does contribute to the overall lavish dining experience. I am not an ""Asian Fusion"" Food advocate at the least--but I can't deny that certain dishes are pretty solid here. The grilled baby back ribs are an easy crowd pleasing starter, as is the Fluke Carpaccio for fish enthusiasts. For entrees, I recommend the Shaking Beef and the Steamed Chilean Sea Bass. The Beef is tender and flavorful, while the Sea Bass is a nice, mild alternative that is perfectly cooked. The Sticky Rice is a nice complement to your meal, but does not particularly impress me in terms of authenticity, as I've had better elsewhere. For Dessert, the steamed Vietnamese Coffee Cake was the clear favorite for the table. The Asian pear Wontons were not particularly impressive, however it deserved kudos for its creative presentation.",1,1,2,Josephine Z.,"Queens, NY",787,445,182

I wish I could give this place five stars because all of these things make it worth the visit. However, the service was sub par. Many of the servers the evening of my visit (a Monday night so maybe not their A team?) were dismissive and not attentive. Most restaurants make me feel welcomed by their staff, however this is not the vibe here. I would suggest training the wait staff on hospitality.

However, I am not giving it 5 stars because, as we were walking out, our waitress ran to us to complain about the tip. ""Was everything okay with your service?"" She said. ""In America"", she continued (we were speaking French, so I assume she thought we were tourists), ""we typically leave 20% tip"". We were shocked and proceeded to show her we DID leave 20% tip each. When she realized her mistake, she just went ""oops"" and left. That was a disappointing end to an otherwise lovely evening. Not sure I like being lectured on what goes on ""in America"" either!

I love that you can just enjoy a pleasant meal surrounded by these celebrities. Now lets get to the food. We were four people so we ordered bunch of stuff and shared. We had Fluke Carpaccio, which was amazing. I highly recommend it, its a must try if you are there. Its one of my fav. We also had crispy shrimp and grilled baby ribs (amaizng!!).

Each portion was somewhat small, but ordering these 3 items filled me up (and I'm 6'9 and 285 lbs). The ambience was relaxing; the wait staff was very diverse, which I enjoyed, for it is NYC!

The ambiance was nice, especially the waiting area and bar. Lots of seating in this area and nice decor. We were seated in the back finally. We were not all that hungry and more just wanted to check out the restaurant so we just went with appetizers and sides. The appetizers were overpriced for only decent food and such small portions. I had a feeling the crab cakes would be small, as I had seen pictures, but they were even smaller when served. The crab cakes are certainly not enough to share among two people, and are not worth it for the taste or price ($18). Only good thing about this appetizer is the dipping sauce. The side of sautéed rice (with shrimp and scallion) was better in terms of taste, price ($10), and portion, but still nothing special.

Everyone showed up and was wonderful. Everyone that is, but our server. I wish our server had showed up for our shift tonight because the person who attempted to serve us unfortunately was inadequate, unequipped and ill prepared. She treated our table like we were patrons at a diner. ""whaddya want?"" she asked when she was ready to take our order. After that brief and harsh welcome, we never saw her again. Calling out to bussers when we needed more water, another drink, another setting... I don't know if she subscribes to the notion that no service is good service, but we do not. And we were very frustrated and disappointed. Having to chase other people down and ask to them away from their duties to service our table when they were busy trying to do their own because our server was no where to be found was not fun.

I dine here almost every weekend and usually have a mediocre service experience that is compromised by the food which is always great but this past Friday I had a worse experience than usual. Not only did we wait an hour  for our reservation for five people (not an unreasonable party) to open up, but the front of the house staff was beyond rude with horrible attitudes. Not a single person was even polite or gracious when we approached them to ask how much longer our table would be and we were repeatedly answered with ""I'm not sure"". Our waiter was barely accommodating yet also condescending when taking our orders which leads me to assume he was warned about our table for whatever reason. We had a reservation for 10:30 for five people, arrived 15 minutes early to let them know that we were all present and to keep us in mind if another table opened up before our reservation. We finally were seated at 11:10 and were left with 30 minutes to order and finish our meal before heading off to our scheduled event.

5.0,2/4/2018,"My best friend and I ventured to Indochine tonight for restaurant week (choice of an appetizer, entree, and dessert for $42!) and it was the most amazing experience. The service was phenomenal and the atmosphere was very cozy and inviting even though it was not very busy when we went.I ordered the cucumber chili martini. The server warned us it had a little bit of a kick to it but I didn't really notice all that spice. The cucumber really stood out though, which I was a fan of! My friend ordered to Indochine martini which was very sweet, so be prepared for that. We ordered the Vietnamese ravioli and lotus salad as our appetizers and they were absolutely delicious! Both so flavorful. The Lotus salad had a little bit of a spice to it though so be warned! The ravioli fell apart in the sauce and in your chopsticks but still to die for. The textures and flavors were amazing.We ordered the spicy chicken and shaky beef as our entrees. We wanted to order the mushrooms as to have a vegetable but the server assured us that the beef was the better choice, and indeed it was! The chicken was great and I loved the peanuts on top, but the beef was just perfectly juicy. You could really taste every flavor in there and could tell everything was made with care. Each entree came with a choice of a side of sticky fried rice or steamed jasmine rice. Both of us went with the sticky rice and were not disappointed! However, I did think that the rice was a little dry.There were only two options for desserts and we got both. I wasn't too excited about the green/white tea ice cream but it ended up being my favorite part of the evening! Apparently I am not a fan of green tea ice cream but the white tea one just melted in your mouth and tasted like how flowers smelled. The lemon tart was like a very light and fluffy lemon bar, also melted in your mouth. Totally delicious!The platter sizes were very decent, especially for a restaurant of this caliber (and the fixed price menu!), although the dessert portions were a little small. After two appetizers and entrees though, it was perfect for us. Everything was absolutely delicious and I would love to go there again!

Last came here two weeks ago for another dinner and the food and the service were excellent. My date from out of town insisted we come back the next time she comes into town!!Tonight was one of the worst experiences I have had here however. When I first got to the restaurant, the hostesses were speaking to a man with no reservation. They chatted him up for about 5 minutes and evidently knew him well - after wrapping up their conversation, they said he would be seated in just a couple of minutes. They ignored me for at least a minute or two before even acknowledging I was there. The hostess then informed me there were no tables available but I was welcome to sit in the lounge! I'm not a vain guy and don't expect to get seated with no res but after the way the spoke to the guy in front of me, this seemed a little rude.My brother and I ordered drinks and then asked the hostess if we could wait for a table. She said 10-20 minutes and we thanked her profusely!! 35 minutes later, after our drinks were empty and I had closed out at the bar, I went and asked her what the status of our table was. She said she could seat us - and upon sitting down, I saw 3 empty 6tops and 4 empty 2tops!

The ravioli on the other hand left much to be desired. The filling was not as flavorful and I found myself dipping the rice paper wrapped spring rolls into the lotus salad dressing. The hanger steak was  delicious with flavors of lemongrass. It was very tender and left us wanting more. The Cornish hen had a curry like flavor and went well with the rice that we ordered. Both the desserts hit the spot for us. The truffle cake was rich and chocolatey, and paired well with the salted caramel ice cream that we had also ordered.

I read a couple reviews that said the dressing was a bit too spicy, but I thought it was just perfect.  Normally I'd steer clear of a salad, thinking it'd be too light or dainty.  Not this one. Boom.Steamed Vietnamese Ravioli - nice presentation, nothing too too special, but totally fine and all were happily consumed. Dipping sauce was actually quite good too.Mains:Roasted Boneless Cornish Hen - tender, juicy good.  Good size too. I would normally be somewhat getting chicken when dining fancy (kind of plain...I can make it myself), but the cornish hen was really good!Marinated Hanger Steak - well seasoned, daikon cut the heartiness of the steak nicely. Yumm.Side: Sticky rice with dried baby shrimp and Vietnamese sausage - I was actually surprised a side was included, and this is wayyyy better than your typical side jasmine rice.

We are young, and they treated us with disrespect, as though we weren't going to pay, or like we weren't dressed well enough. It was upsetting. They even asked us to move after we were done with our very bland salmon dish and said bc they were making us move dessert was on them, well it wasn't- we had to pay for it. Not to mention the people sitting next to us were sniggering and it was completely rude. I don't understand the hype of this place- the food is super bland and expensive... I guess the only cool thing about it is the wall paper and decor if you're looking for that Instagram pic. I did think their food was presented well, I took some nice photos, but was getting looked at like I was an outsider because I was taking photos. I don't understand why they would treat a guest so rudely- we were paying customers I felt very uncomfortable and unwelcomed and will not be returning upon my visits to New York yearly.",0,0,0,Lux B.,"Sacramento, CA",1,43,5

4.0,9/26/2016,"My husband, sister, friend and I went to Indochine on Friday night for dinner around 8pm. The drinks are delicious! My table ordered the indochine martini and everyone loved it; whereas I had the Rose Sangria which was also yummy. We tried a bunch of different appetizers -- Fish Soup, Short Ribs, Ravioli, and Lotus Salad. They were all good but my favorite would be the short ribs! For the entrees, we had the Spicy Chicken, the Chilean Sea Bass and the jumbo Shrimp. Out of those the Spicy Chicken and Shrimp were good because they were easier to share and had more flavor. In dessert, the chocolate mousse is a must have. It was really delicious and the perfect way to end the evening. As far as atmosphere, it's busy and can get a little loud. Which is fun but can make talking / hearing each other a little tough. Prices are reasonable but slightly on the higher side, but you are paying for location and quality.

It was so delicious and it was big enough to share with my boyfriend. Grilled salmon- Not good. It had a charred burnt, bitter taste. I couldn't taste anything else besides that. The salmon was sitting in a broth with mushrooms, which did not go with the salmon at all. Once again that burnt charred taste ruined the entire dish.Hazelnut mouse cake- Amazing and very creative. It is a French restaurant after all. Shaken beef (not on the pre-theater menu)- The beef was very tender and flavorful. It had a soy/hoison marinade with a nice barbecue taste.

They weren't very pushy with the drink orders as well. We tried the lotus salad and beef tartare for appetizers off the restaurant week menu, both were to die for. Amazing balance of flavors, it had everything... sweet, sour and spicy. I can't pick a favorite among these two. For the main course, few of my friends had the fish, which was catfish steamed in the same kind of sweet, spicy, sour broth and me and a friend had the beef tenderloin. I would have to say the fish which came on a bed of bok choy was really tasty and also probably a lot healthier than the beef, but the beef was just spectacular. Both dishes were good, but for me beef was the clear winner. They served the main course with either sticky rice or fried rice with sausage. All I can say is get the fried rice. For dessert we tried the chocolate cake, salted caramel ice cream and the lemon tart. Chocolate cake and the ice cream were standard. The lemon tart was amazing. The service was pretty standard. We didn't order any drinks, apart from an espresso so I don't know how they are made.

The place was very well decorated. Turns out we just showed up early for the dinner rush because come 6:30 it was starting to fill up. They have a pre theatre menu that you choose an appetiser then a main dish which comes with white jasmine rice or Vietnamese sticky rice. Both are really good. And then you get a dessert. There is a bar too. But they serve nonalcoholic drinks. I had the beef tar tar which came with shrimp flavoured chips that made the dish perfect. Spicy and sweet and scrumptious. I tried the summer rolls (my friend ordered) too and they were really good. And well constructed. Then I had the salmon main dish. It was cooked medium rare which I LOVED. It was in a miso kind of soup that tasted amazing it really complimented the dish. The salmon was cooked to perfection. And well worth the money. The dessert was just standard mango sorbet but it was presented very nicely with a sprig of Thai basil. This whole meal for me was 38 dollars. For the pre theatre menu.

1.0,2/1/2016,"Zero. Forget the food, it was our Most horrible experience to even walk in the restaurant. The hostess insulted us, scolded us and finally could not seat us. We gave a reservation for 2 adults but our mistake, we walked in with our 3 year old child. Who was sleeping in our arms. And we humbly request for a comfortable chair for our kid. The mannerism, the body language and tone and policy of the restaurant hostess was such they made us feel so bad, so guilty and scolded us consistently for getting the child, who was not in the reservation we made online just 60 minutes before arrival. It was so belittling for us. We came for food and to pay for it. They couldn't give us appropriate seating for 3 persons. The hostess treated us like we were a pack of charity seekers. She kept scolding me and insulting me. She asked me if I understood English!!! After about 10 minutes, I got tears in my eyes and had to go away. Coz at least 8-10 big tables were empty. And they couldn't offer us anything but claustrophobic spaces. Next day when I rang to complain about the bad behavior of the hostess, the polite manager did listen very patiently but she said - it's very difficult to get into Indochine. And so, we do not give bigger tables to less than 4-5 persons.! She attributes the issue to cultural differences between the guests (us) and the hostess. Phew- these excuses don't work for diversity rich NYC- the cultural melting pot of US. These excuses don't work for a family who has been insulted for getting along a child. So whatever, back to the Sunday night- we had walked out of Indochine, sat in the car- rung and got reservation for two adults and one kid at SPICE MARKET for arrival in next 30 minutes. And got bowled over by the courtesy, politeness and wonderful experience there. They saw we have a kid in arms- they offered sofas seating for us, gave kids menu option. We warn people with kids to be careful when booking at Indochine. The space seating is like a black hole. And the hostess might dig a dagger in your heart with harsh words and rude behavior and policy. Hospitality industry does not need rude people.

We ordered: All the veg appetizers,the stew, and the sides: brussel sprouts and sauteed veggies. Got white rice since fried rice had meat broth in it. Wish they had brown rice as a healthier alternative. In the future, I hope they add more vegetarian options (maybe seasonal, etc), and perhaps bring in more of the french influence. I have a palate that can handle a lot of heat, so I did ask for some hot sauce, but it was perfect!

I get this is a ""hip"" spot celebrities supposedly go to (not sure why), but it doesn't mean you treat the rest of the customers like total garbage. I was with a group of 6 girls celebrating my friends birthday. We go out to nice restaurants often so this isn't our first time around the block. Nice restaurant or not, I've never quite experienced more rude people in my entire life. They had no wait and extra tables open, but were literally circling our table like a shark rushing us to order and get out of there. Clearly there criteria to employing servers is that they have to be over 6 feet, anorexic, miserable and cant smile. Even the hostess man was pacing the restaurant like a shark. it was the least relaxing meal I've ever had. A  friend also came in with a balloon and brought it to the table. The man bolted to our table and in his stuck up manner said ""were going to have to check that balloon"". Oh I'm sorry, your restaurant is too good for a damn balloon. They also never gave it back because I am sure they threw it out. One of our severs (the only one who wasn't a 6 foot tall model), was the biggest jerk. My friend who is probably the sweetest person you would ever meet kindly asked her what cocktail is better and her response was ""what do you mean"" as she looked like she was about to throw up on us. my friend responded ""well, which one is sweeter"" because she is totally shocked by the nasty response. The next part was great. The server responded once again looking in disgust ""the pear lychee is sweet and the sangria has mixed fruit in it and is sweet so I don't know what you're trying to ask"" something along those lines. I have never wanted to reach over and slap someone across the face as much as I wanted to that woman. I watched my friend who was celebrating her birthday have this huge smile on her face to having it get completely wiped off as she was in total disbelief that someone could be so mean and rude.

They were very accommodating although when I actually got there, I had to wait almost 20 minutes before actually being seated. In order to make up for it, they offered us a shrimp appetizer before the meal, which was really nice. The food was very good. The Amok Cambodgien was amazing - fish was cooked beautifully! The Roasted BONELESS Cornish Hen most definitely had bones in it, so I'm not sure what's going on there. In fact, it even had wings and I wouldn't have ordered it had I known there would be bones.

3.0,8/23/2015,"Technically, this place deserves a little over 3 stars, but not 4. Why, you ask? Well, while the dishes were very tasty and the ambiance romantic, there were little things that add up.I have to say the cocktails were definitely one of the highlights of Indochine - I recommend the Indochine Martini. For appetizers, we had the spicy squid and the steamed ravioli. The squid was delicious. However, it was served on a big, uncut piece of lettuce, which is difficult to eat with chopsticks. Why not serve it chopped? Also, the squid was served with sugar cane (not part of the dish's description on the menu), which was tasty but not so edible. The ravioli were great, but be warned that they look exactly like spring rolls. We ordered the sole filet and Cornish hens for main courses. Both dishes were excellent. However, I couldn't understand why the size of the dishes was so different. A decent amount of fish, and an unlikely-to-be-finished amount of Cornish hens. Another thing is that these two dishes were in desperate need of rice, which had to be ordered as a side dish. Moving on to dessert - we got the truffle mousse cake, which was yummy but not mind-blowing. To sum it up - good, but not excellent.",1,0,0,Gal S.,"Manhattan, NY",0,4,7
4.0,8/18/2015,"Come for the intoxicating palm tree decor; leave feeling satiated after a delicious Vietnamese-French fusion meal.

Of course: this isn't the place to grab a quick bite in a pair of sweatpants. However, it would be amiss to not also credit the restaurant for its high-quality food.I've been to Indochine twice within the past year and was thrilled with both of my meals. The last time I went with my boyfriend, we got the catfish, beef salad and their assortment of fruity gelato during Restaurant week. The portions are of a decent size, and the restaurant doesn't skimp on the meat and fish.Each course was filled with lots of flavor without being too spicy or ambitious.

Our second attempt to get a table was at Indochine and they managed to get us seated in a couple minutes.The ambience is great as most people mentioned. Very tight space though, and almost impossible to move out of my seat without butting the next table. We got water refills every ten mins or so. Our waitress was very friendly and welcoming. My boyfriend ordered the steamed Vietnamese ravioli, marinated hanger steak and the classic French lemon tart. I had the fried spring rolls, spicy chicken breast and mango and raspberry sorbet. We both got the sticky rice as our side as well. We also got the gin gin and Indochine martini. Pricey drinks but enjoyable.Overall I think the food was great. The fried spring rolls were flavorful and the ""ravioli"" was interesting. The spicy chicken was nothing special compared to the hanger steak my boyfriend got. I stole a few pieces from him hah. The sticky rice with dried shrimp and sausage is a must. I couldn't finish even half of it but it was delicious. Very filling portions! The lemon tart was a better choice than the sorbet I got. My boyfriend gobbled that up in a few bites. The raspberry sorbet has bits of seed in it but the mango was very smooth and refreshing. I think the dessert portion is relatively small, but I must say I actually appreciate that.

She and her colleague clearly didn't care and were too cool to be bothered. We left 15 minutes after our reservation time because it was unclear when our table would be ready and the collective attitude of the host and hostess was so off putting my husband did not want to stay.  I am sure the table was filled immediately by people who don't know better. We walked down the street to Gato.  The hostess was so nice and friendly and made sure we were taken care of in short order. We got a table by the window and had great food without the attitude.  Not that it matters, but we live in the neighborhood and periodically go to Indochine.  We will never go again.

The servings of fish was quite large and the seasonings were good. The garnishment of the sugarcane was a nice touch as it added a bit of sweetness to the otherwise spicy dish.

Everything was scrumptious. I LOVE their kale salad. For mains, my girl and I shared the Chilean sea bass and the duck breast and my vegetarian friend ordered the vegetarian stew. Both the sea bass and the duck are served with broth and steamed vegetables (bok choy). The sea bass was the winner in my opinion. The vegetarian stew was delicious too.

5.0,8/2/2014,"I'll admit that I came here solely because I had just read Grace Coddington's memoir (falling in love with her in the process) and this is one of her favorite restaurants in the city. I might be a little biased but I LOVED it; I'm happy (and relieved) to say I totally approve of Grace's culinary, as well as sartorial, taste.You might miss the unassuming entrance on Lafayette, but once inside, Indochine has a real ""see and be seen"" atmosphere. And yet, it was smaller and more informal than I expected, kitschy even, with the green palm fronds painted on the walls, mismatched sofas in the waiting area, and black-and-white tile floors. The bathroom is a harshly lit two-stall affair and could have been transported from your neighborhood diner. This all kind of adds to the appeal of Indochine, which manages to juxtapose an old-world glamour with a sense of eclecticism, charm, and warmth. Case in point: animal-print tribal headbands and black jumpsuits were among the things worn by the crowd.We were here for restaurant week, which is a risky endeavor, but we were not disappointed in the least. The Vietnamese ""ravioli"" - poorly translated - is more like a steamed spring roll bursting with deliciousness and was one of my favorite dishes we tried. The fried bean curd was also very good, which involved delicate slices of crispy tofu served with micro greens and a tangy sauce. (A girl at the next table ordered the beef salad as her appetizer, which looked amazing.) For entrées, we got the catfish and hangar steak, which were both very well done but not particularly imaginative. The sticky rice, with bits of shrimp and sausage, which comes as a complimentary side, was pretty awesome. Unless you'd prefer white rice to go with a curry, I'd totally recommend getting this.I ordered the Rhyme & Reason, which was a very pretty and refreshing vodka cocktail with lemon, lemongrass and bits of coriander swirling about. My friend got the Southeast, which was rosy in color and had a kick to it, the cousin of a spicy margarita. For dessert, we each got the lemon tart, which was more akin to a lemon bar in the shape of a slice. The lemon tart here is FIERCE. It is served with a dollop of unsweetened cream, which I felt was necessary to counterbalance the zing of the lemon. I had to get up early the next morning, but I think it would taste fantastic with an espresso to further cut the lemon. Next time :)",1,0,1,Michelle L.,"Los Angeles, CA",46,87,0

What I didn't like about Indochine was that rice is not included in the meal.

As amazing as the venue was I expected the food to be amazing as well expected with the high price. **This review is for the restaurant week menu.**Well, I got the steamed vietnamese ravioli, steamed catfish, sticky rice, and mango raspberry sorbet. The ravioli was good, but it was no more than just a fancy vietnamese style dim sum with a bed of bean sprouts on the bottom. I did like the skin of the ravioli though. It was clear and soft and a little gelatin like. Next, I would skip the catfish. It literally seemed like all there was steamed fish and soy sauce. There was barely enough black bean paste to cover the fish and the soy sauce was too strong/salty to bring out the sesame and ginger flavor. However, I did like the sticky rice as I thought that was more original, so definitely get that over white rice. There were bits of pork inside the rice?

All of our dishes were just delicious and I would think, anyone would enjoy their food, no matter their tastes... You cannot go wrong with any of the soups, appetizers or seafood dishes. We started with champagne and a whiskey sour. We ordered the following and recommend them all:-pho soup with sliced beef, rice noodles in a broth. -spring rolls with vermicelli, shrimp and chicken, wrapped in rice paper with a sweet and sour sauce (roll them in cabbage) -whole red snapper (delicious smoky sweet and sour sauce)-chillean sea bass in chilli paste and ginger soy broth with basil and peanuts  -sautéed rice with English peas, egg and baby shrimp- Vietnamese coffee cake This was the perfect amount of food for two people.

I went for dinner during restaurant week (RW), in which they give you very few options to pick from...which translates into even fewer if you don't eat meat.I decided to go with the regular menu since the only fish option for main course in the RW menu was catfish which I highly dislike. I got the $27 filet of sole in coconut milk and banana leaf which was...CATFISH! Awful! Obviously they don't think very highly of their customers here...assuming they are stupid and can't tell the difference and not considering that they deserve to know about changes in the menu... I ended up having just a couple of soupy bok choi leaves that were under the fish...$27...My friend didn't finish her hen dish either...The lemon tart was literally half a regular slice, which was fine because it was not that good...Allow me to save you $120 (for 2, no wine) and go elsewhere!",0,0,0,magda p.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,8,0

5.0,12/20/2013,"I was fully prepared to be disappointed by Indochine, and here's why: my office was having its holiday party here (party of 17 for dinner), and my office manager had called a week ahead of time asking if they could offer a vegan option. The hostess flat-out told him ""no."" I figured it would be alright, though, since the menu items look versatile enough for me.On the day of the party, I saw the pre-ordered menu and felt really sad because it really didn't look like I'd be able to eat anything. I called Indochine myself, and the hostess was like, ""Oh right, you're the person who's not eating."" Great. She told me that I could order whatever off the regular menu, but that nothing was vegan, only vegetarian. I just decided to stay positive and go to the party anyway.Upon arrival, I was so impressed with the attentive service. The servers all look like supermodels, but they're definitely on their game too. We checked our coats and waited for our entire party to be seated at a huge long table near the back of the restaurant. The waitresses immediately started filling our water glasses and pouring the wine (nonstop), which had been preordered. Then the preordered appetizers started to arrive. We had some kind of ravioli, veggie spring rolls, I think spare ribs too. I noticed the spring rolls seemed vegan - and they were tasty too! So I took a waitress aside and told her I wouldn't be eating the regular entrees. I asked for a spring roll order for myself and the grilled eggplant appetizer with some rice. Let me tell you: the servers treated me like a queen! Not only did I get those two items, but they brought out a vegetable curry and a side of greens without oyster sauce just for me! Everything looked and smelled so good that my coworkers around me were like, ""Whoa, what's that?"" I let everyone try the food, and they all agreed that I had been treated exceptionally, despite the initial phone conversations. Everyone else was raving about the food! The regular entrees included duck, filet mignon, and sea bass.The dinner was seriously a success. Even my office manager said he had gone into the experience thinking he was going to leave a bad review, but we all had our expectations blown away. I would definitely come back here!

I realized I had to admit the fact here is one of the greatest restaurants in NYC.A couple weeks ago, I went here with my friend for the first time just to eat dinner without much expectation. Once I entered the entrance door, I found it something special and felt as if I were standing in a luxury resort hotel in South East Asia. Their décor was not too gorgeous, but very moderate to feel comfortable in the oriental atmosphere. Without taking time, such a gentle ambience convinced me to realize their honorable 25 years history in NY.We ordered a Spicy Beef Salad as Appetizer, Beefsteak with lemon sauce as Entree, and sticky rice. Every single meal was served properly quickly with perfect timing. Also, every meal was extremely yummy. Salad was totally fresh, and beefsteak was very tender and juicy even after 30 minutes passed. Also, the lemon source on top of the beefsteak was absolutely magical. It was slightly sour and greatly enhanced the savory of beef. Sticky rice was also fantastic. Without eating something with it, I enjoyed the taste itself and it refreshed my mouth. It is not a supporting role any more. Just awesome. Only you need to note is to be sure to make a reservation even on weekdays. After 25 years since established, here is still one of the most popular Vietnamese restaurants in NYC.

Get the best value the Prix fix which is every night till 7 and all day on Sunday and Monday.The service is very attentive. The food is perfection. The dinner has three courses my favorite appetizer was the ravioli which is a cross between a steamed dumpling and a summer roll. My friend did not like it but I could make a meal of those and be happy.I would suggest going with a party of four and trying everything but my favorite appetizer was the ravioli. We also tried the eggplant which was very good but I would have rather had more ravioli.The second course we shared the ribs which are like no other rib I have tried. They are probably marinated for 24 hours and have a wild seasoned coating which was thrilling and spicy. We both loved that. We also shared the salmon which was grilled in lemon grass and ginger and very light.We also shared the chocolate mousse cake which was very dark chocolate mousse with a white chocolate crust. This dessert was a winner and don't bother with the hazelnut it was not in the same league as the mousse cake.All three courses were 35.00 and worth every penny.

Her friend works there, and she was so nice. All the staff were friendly and attentive. I was there 15 minutes late due to work, and afraid they might cancel my reservation, but they didn't mind. I guess it was because my friend was there on time, the reservation was made at an earlier time (after 7:30/8pm gets crowded and loud), and her friend might helped a bit, too. I've passed by this area quite few times but I've never noticed the restaurant. It's dim lighted and tables are placed quite closed together. It's an overall nice place for date nights, friends birthdays, and etc. I'm going to keep this review short and sweet as I tend to yap a lot.Appetizers: my bestie ordered short ribs - nice dry rub with a bit spicy peppery kick. 5/5I ordered spicy beef salad - big bowl with generous portions of thinly sliced and marinated beef. Not spicy at all, but dressing was delicious and light. 5/5We were surprised with the portions of their appetizers being big for sharing and semi-full after eating.Entree: Bestie ordered whole red snapper - looks good, sauce is red and garlic flavored. I didn't taste it, and she orders this dish a lot in different restaurants. Based on her expression, I guess it's 3.5/5shrimp rice - big bowl 4/5I got the seabass - comes in a Chinese medicine clay pot with little soup/sauce, green leaves, cherry tomatoes, and wild mushroom(?). Never had sea bass, but it melts in my mouth and tastes buttery. Very fresh and aromatic. Maybe the clay pot gave the soup a bit of the medicinal taste (slightly bitter taste), but it's a nice and healthy dish. 5/5sticky rice - small bowl with small dried shrimps and wild mushrooms. 4/5Dessert:Friend ordered chocolate mousse cake and a sorbet (can't remember but it was really good). Mousse cake looks nice but she left some on the plate. 4/5I ordered the recommended coffee cake - moist and not overly sweet. It also comes with some espresso/Vietnamese shaved ice which balances the cake. I was too full to really judge on the cake but I still think it's good. 4/5I also got the Indochine iced coffee - love this so much! Espresso/coffee ice cubes, cream and coffee come in two different bottles for me to mix my own. Vietnamese coffee are usually very strong, and I was never costumed to, but this is perfect! 5/5We also got complimentary assorted dessert plate (either from her lovely friend or the iced coffee, probably her awesome friend). It had truffles, marshmallows, butter biscuits, almond clusters, and this other treats that we couldn't figure it out. 4/5Drinks:I wasn't going to drink, but decided to get a glass of Malbec (Argentinian red). Delicious! 5/5She got a pineapple cocktail drink, and not sure if she got the lychee drink, but she loved the pineapple one. 5/5We were so stuffed after the meal!!! It was good to see my bestie, and spent quality time with her over great food!

When we walked in the place was decorated in this faux Vietnamese style-- I think there may have been bamboo wallpaper involved.

Extremely salty and there was a flaccid little pile of vegetables in the middle, very sad.Small highlight was the desserts: we liked the pear dumplings and especially the multitude of dipping sauces that it came with.All the food there seems like someone's *conception* of Vietnamese food and not grounded in actual local cuisine or technique.

The shrimp, scallops mussels and calamari were prepared well and the seafood mix went well with the cabbage.

We were told, with more attitude, that it was our fault that we had an extra person and that we had to wait. He added that the table directly behind the host station and near the exit door was our original table. (One would assume that a two-week old reservation would result in better seating.) This was our que to leave (as the night would have likely gotten progressively worse) and we strolled across the street for the superior service and fabulous food at Butter.  A happy ending, indeed.  My advice  to those who choose to frequent a restaurant that has lost it's luster long ago, be mindful that the current staff (except for the nice coat check lady) might be delusional to think they are the special ones and that the patrons are simply props.",0,0,0,Gerald P.,"New York, NY",14,12,5

2.0,1/23/2013,"I was searching for a Restaurant Week location in Village/Washington Square area, and found Indochine initially as interesting fusion of various Asian and Indian cuisines. This turned into a restaurant experience that was subpar for not taking advantage of the extra Restaurant Week buzz that could form. The appetizers - shrimp roll and friend spring rolls - were not bad. The spring roll had chunks of meat that were not evenly seasoned. The cracked pepper chicken had too much pepper on each morsel, leaving a strong aftertaste. The steak was tasty, especially recommended in medium rare preparation, but the dichon slices flanked underneath the cut steak filet were not poached fully and tasted a tad sour. The two highlights of the meal - the dessert and the drinks. Lemon tart and raspberry sorbet hit the spot. Be sure to taste the house sangria and the chili and cucumber martini; nice, silky smooth first taste with a spicy, flavorful kick with a touch of salt at the end.

No one said sorry or made an attempt to make the situation better.  One of the girls just put a napkin on top of the uber wet spot which continued to advance until 4 seats were covered in water.  My wife asked for paper towels because her sleeves were wet and with a very unpleasing attitude one of the girls said we can change the table cloth and so they did as if making us a big, tiring favor.  A posh restaurant would have definitely taken care of that immediately and have at least said sorry instead of waiting half an hour until the whole table was wet.  Food was mediocre with the exception of the Chilean sea bass and the creme brulee.  My sister in law got burned by the incompetent bus boy who spilled pho on her leg (burning water of course) and yet again not even an apology.  I had to beg for water refills which in a long night only came twice and only for my wife who asked for water since no one else got their glass refilled.

They had a great selection for a prix fix menu.  We were worried about small portions since its a fine dining place but they were perfect portions.  We also strayed a bit from the RW menu w an order of two cocktails and a bowl of curry fish soup which is closely related to bun mam.  We found ourselves overstuffed but delicious and worth it. The prix fix menu is the way to go bc you're trying a bit of everything at a reasonable price and trust me it's tastes fantastic.

I was also in love with the lemon tart by the end of the evening.I also had the duck confit salad and their side of house fried rice. Both were flavorful, light and I'm glad I chose them for my dinner. However, it was just good, not great.

4.0,7/24/2012,"Indochine is as good as it ever was. The space really captures the glamour of a bygone era, and that may be the secret to its enduring success. I appreciate that the quality of experience is consistent, though it's no longer in its heyday. (That would be the Undochine days when the Studio 54 crowd partied in the basement.) You still get attractive FOH (loved our server's Missoni minidress with low grey suede heels) and proficient bussers who notice a dirty plate yet don't reach for it until you have finished eating. The food is excellent, and it's hard to find haute asian in this city. (RIP Chinatown Brasserie with its phenomenal Peking duck.)So, what did we eat? We went at 5:30 because we had theater plans, and I ordered from the Restaurant Week menu. Their prix fixe comes with the usual three courses plus side dishes and coffee and tea. My companion's summer rolls were fresh and tangy. This is where you can tell whether you're in Chinatown or not, mainly by the vegetables being used. I had crispy bean curd with my beloved mustard dressing and a salad of rocket with pea and corn shoot. Amazeballs! It's a nice change from the ubiquitous kale or beets all over town. Deli tofu is my snack of choice when I have the drunchies. When it's freshly cooked by an upscale kitchen, it is a whole different animal. Plus you get more tofu than four to a pack :) My entree was steamed catfish marinated in a black bean chili paste with a sesame soy broth served on a bed of bok choy. On their regular menu, this is chilean sea bass, but I really loved the catfish and a side of sticky rice with dried baby shrimp, shitake and Vietnamese sausage. It gave the dish a Creole dimension that would make for some really innovative fusion cuisine. The catfish was so tender and light! My date had spicy shrimp with long beans and diced tomato and basil, which he was relieved to report did not taste as Italian as he had feared it would. Then dessert was a lemon bar that they called a tart, tasty with coffee.It was a perfect metaphor seeing the paparazzi snap photos of Courtney Love on the Bowery while we were parking the car.

1.0,5/7/2012,"Came here for the Gatz dinner break special at the Public Theater across the street since it was recommended as a participating restaurant for the 75-minute dinner break. The restaurant was right across the street, so I thought we stood the very best chance of making it back to the theater in time.I want to preface the rest of this review by saying I had a negative experience at the restaurant -- if you're going to get angry at reading a lengthy negative (but true) account of the service, then stop right here -- it's not going to get much better.We were among the first group of people to get seated at our table around 5:40pm. I noticed that the only menus present were the Gatz menu choice of 1 of 3 appetizers, entree (chicken or fish), and dessert for $32. I wasn't necessarily thrilled with the choices of entrees and wondered where the regular menu was, but then I decided against it in order to be expedient on time.When the server came, I ordered my meal with some very particular questions and instructions: ""Was it possible to substitute the chocolate truffle dessert?"" The waiter replied that it was not. Fair enough, but could I get a tea instead of a coffee? He took that change down. I also requested that I have a fork delivered with my food. He took down the complete order and we were well on our way through the meal.Our waiter came by about 10 minutes later and told me that he couldn't substitute the coffee for tea -- that it would have to be extra. I thought that was kind of odd -- after all, what could the cost difference of coffee and tea be for the restaurant, but I told him that in that case, forget about it -- just no coffee. He stopped by once again after the appetizer was served, but was not to be seen again until we were leaving -- more on that later.I ordered the Vietnamese ravioli -- which was fine, but nothing to write home about. I actually found myself putting a lot of the sauce on the dish (which I rarely do) because it was lacking in flavor and actually found myself wondering if it might benefit from a dash of salt. (No salt or pepper on the tables, so none added.) Four ""raviolis"" were included (shaped more in the size of small spring rolls), and I was pleased that the portion was quite generous for a restaurant that probably still considers itself trendy.Next was the entree -- spicy chicken. The chicken was chopped hastily -- with some rather huge unbroken pieces filling the bottom of my dish. Still no delivery of the fork, but I didn't ask for it because again -- I just want to get out on time and not be fussy. The flavors were fine -- but not stellar.I checked my watch after the main course was finished and was excited -- it was only 6:30pm -- the show restarted at 7pm, so we had plenty of time to walk around before sitting down again for the next 2 hours and 45 minutes. I estimated the dessert would come shortly and we could be out of there in 10 minutes.That is when everything went downhill. Our waiter was nowhere to be found. The table next to us was seated about 7 minutes after us by a different waitress. I had noticed that they had a different entree (mussels), and that the woman asked her server if she could order dessert at that time. The waitress mentioned the woman's options, and then 2-3 minutes later she had her dessert while we still waited for ours.The man sitting to my left had also been seated by this other waitress, I had also noticed that he had a completely different entree AND dessert -- and it was at that point that I realized they both must have ordered off of the regular menu, and they must have ordered off the normal pre-fixe menu, which I had seen earlier in the day when walking by the restaurant.I wondered why the server didn't mention that there was another pre-fixe menu available, even though I had asked about dessert alternatives and tea instead of coffee. (The normal pre-fixe menu offers a choice of three desserts and an option of coffee OR tea -- for only $3 more.)The table to my right had gotten their coffee and dessert, paid their check, and left while we still waited to catch our waiter... and we waited... Now it was 6:45pm, we finally saw the waiter and asked for the check. I told him, ""I just wanted to let you know -- we never received our desserts."" He acknowledged the issue and said they would be coming out in just a bit -- but we said to forget about it -- we just wanted to pay and leave.I watched as he took our credit card, and then proceeded to stop at other tables on his round. We got up and waited outside of the tables so we could grab the check, pay and go. We had to stop our waiter again and ask him for the credit card -- we signed and headed out of there.I understand that service in this situation is difficult, but since this is towards the end of the Gatz run, the servers should be experienced  at this by now.

It was actually a huge portion so I was well on my way to full when the entree came. I had the hanger steak done perfectly medium rare.

The staff looked like they just stepped off of a Marc Jacobs runway show but everyone was very attentive so I can't complain. We ordered the mussels, crab cakes and spring rolls as appetizers. All three were delicious and came in large portions. For entrees, we got the steak, salmon and spicy chicken. Also, very good but nothing so spectacular that I would crave them. Dessert was kind of generic. I ordered the Coconut Creme Brulee (yummy!) and my friends got the Lemon Tart (too tart!) and the Raspberry/Coconut Sorbet (so-so).We chose to dine at Indochine because of it's fabulous past and to see if it still has something to offer. It's a very beautiful restaurant that attracts a lot of industry people and the food is up to par with the clientele that it serves. It's more of a ""seen and be seen"" kind of place and if that's what you're into then this is your spot.My only real gripe is the tight spaces in between tables. There's absolutely no privacy unless you get seated in one of their large, circular boothes. I can literally hear every single conversation within a 2-table radius of ours.

3.0,1/18/2012,"""Girls in New York look like giraffes, long legs, long necks...[edited for family consumption]"" - Shwayze*The service staff appears as if they were plucked from the most recent Stella McCartney Fashion Week runway: stunningly thin and beautiful, semi-vacant facial expressions and a thinly-veiled annoyance with being obligated to check your coat because they'd much rather be sashaying somewhere right now.  If you come before the dinner rush starts, the atmosphere may seem museum-like: ""It's very cold and very beautiful, and you're not allowed to touch anything.""  Surprisingly, once the crowd pours in, the scene tends to get lively and energizing, if not a bit boisterous at times.   Good place for groups.  We were a party of 5, and there was a birthday party for a well-dressed and fun group of about a dozen mid-30 somethings right next to us.   It's also a good place for dates, as there are a few intimate looking semi-circle booths that face out towards the rest of the dining area.Their prixe-fixe menu is a surprisingly good deal - I think it was $32 - and all the portions are way bigger than you'd expect for a place like this.  The fried chicken spring rolls were a tasty start, but with a gluttonous portion of 5 I almost felt I was eating at the Cheesecake Factory.  The spicy chicken breast dish was a winner, and the envy of the table.  I'm giving this a solid 3-star rating.  Good times, good food...and would be happy to dine here again, but not necessarily compelled to do so before hitting many other ""bookmarked"" spots first.  *I cannot believe I just quoted Shwayze.  This is a new low point in my Yelping career.",6,5,1,Dominick Q.,"Manhattan, NY",611,194,39

3.0,9/5/2011,"I went here with my boyfriend for the prix-fixe dinner menu for Summer Restaurant Week 2011. First note- all of the female employees are supermodels and unfortunately, to fulfill the stereotype, their looks were all they were good for. Although I enjoyed most of the food (more on that later) my experience was somewhat overshadowed by really piss poor service. Our waitress ignored us the entire night and eventually another waitress started helping our table. If I'm forking out decent money, I don't want to be treated like a second class citizen.  Now for the high points. I shared 2 appetizers, entrees, a side and desserts.Appetizers: Summer rolls and steamed ravioli- both decent, but no different than at any mediocre Thai/Vietnamese restaurant. Sauces helped save the dishesEntrees: catfish and flank steak. Both REALLY good and basically saved the meal. Between the two of them, the flank steak won out but I'd recommend both. It was perfectly grilled, spices were out of this world, juicy, and tender. Shoestring fries that came with it were mediocre but at that point, it didn't even matter- I was sold. The catfish was served in a delicious broth with bok choy and other veggies. It was just really clean, nicely spiced, and really tender.Side: We both got the sticky rice w/ shitake mushrooms- which I adore. I enjoyed it but basically it is really hard to mess up a sticky rice bad enough that I won't like it. Dessert: Mango/coconut sorbet and lemon tart. The sorbet was flavorful and enjoyable but paled in comparison to the tart. This lemon tart was one of my favorite desserts ever. Rich, creamy, tart, with caramel glaze and prefect crust. Just lovely. P.S. the lighting is so dim you can barely see the menu-but I guess that's swank for you",1,0,0,Marianna V.,"Philadelphia, PA",1,7,0
4.0,8/4/2011,"This review is based on the prix-fixe dinner menu for Summer Restaurant Week (month) 2011. Right off the bat we spied Kate Lanphear looking chic and sipping cocktails whilst waiting to be seated. Nothing sets the tone for a bourgie dining experience like running into one of my favorite fashion icons.We were escorted to a quiet table in the back by one of the supermodel hostesses (supermodel-ness proved to be a theme amongst staffers). I'm kind of broke so I abstained from ordering a drink, but everyone seemed to be very pleased with their cocktails. The prix-fixe menu had some really nice choices, and I was impressed with the quality and portions throughout (you never know with Restaurant Week!) A break down of what I ordered/tried:- Green Mango Salad - a very impressive portion! Fresh, firm, shredded mango in a nice sweet-tart dressing, with several plump shrimp. It was light and tasty, though not noticeably better than a papaya salad at an above-average Thai takeout joint.- Marinated Hanger Steak with shoestring fries and steamed Daikon- The steak was my favorite part of the evening. Perfectly cooked (medium), with a very flavorful glaze, and a nice char on the outside. The shoestring fries were glorified 'potato sticks,' and the steamed daikon was a nice accompaniment to cut the richness of the beef.- Mango-Coconut Sorbet & Lemon TartA friend and I shared both of the dessert offerings. The Sorbet was whatever, two tiny scoops, kind of icy, nothing special. The lemon tart reminded me of the lemon bars my mom makes, with a sweet caramelized crust, something very special!Overall it was a good experience, the service was well timed even with our large party. The interiors were a little dated in my opinion, but at the same time, its an institution and I wouldn't change them! Well... maybe I would cut down on the palm-printed wallpaper, but now I'm just nitpicking.",0,1,0,Maddie O.,"Brooklyn, NY",102,293,10
4.0,7/15/2011,"Walking into Indochine is like flashing back to Dynasty-era New York.  Palm trees stand against oversized tree frond wallpaper, black and red wicker chairs reappear throughout both the lounge and dining areas, and more than one patron was seen sporting generous shoulder pads. (Not to mention the lady in the straw hat!).  Nevertheless, Indochine feels glamorous and nostalgic rather than dated.  The dim setting is punctuated by red-orange sconces and glowing table candles, and the ambiance was warm especially as the restaurant began to fill (around 8:30 on a Wednesday).  There are also a number of gorgeous green leather circular booths towards the rear of the restaurant that make for very intimiate dining.We were here during Restaurant Week and ordered from their prix-fixe menu.  I tried the crispy marinated tofu (ok, though the accompanying salad of fresh pea and corn shoots was tasty), the marinated hanger steak (so good!) with poached daikon, and the mango and coconut sorbets (lovely).  I also ordered the sticky rice.  This was unusual: nutty, sweet, and hearty.  My friend noted that it tasted like warm granola with sausage (in a good way).  Portion sizes were surprisingly generous and, with the heavy sticky rice, I could only finish about half of each dish.  The service was friendly, though generally absent.  Nevertheless, we had a great time: ambiance is where Indochine excels.  The food is tasty, but not particularly memorable or worth making a special trip for (except for maybe the fantastic pineapple and ginger ""Indochine martini.""  I'd return for drinks alone!).",0,0,1,Anna M.,"Manhattan, NY",17,50,2
4.0,7/14/2011,"Despite the fact that I don't usually like places where the women are half the age of most of the men, I really enjoy Indochine.  The decor feels reminiscent of the Beverly Hills hotel (minus the pink) and even features the same amazing banana leaf wallpaper.  It borders on cheesy, but somehow manages to avoid it - maybe it's the model staff (and the high fashion clothes hanger type of models) or the fashion crowd type diners.  The crab cakes are very good - the sauce is exceptional and really makes the dish, but overall the food is not exceptional.  It is reliably good, but this is not the place to go if you're in a foodie type of mood.This is a fun scene to take in with consistent (even if it leaves a little to be desired) food.",1,0,0,Jennie E.,"Venice, CA",121,7,0

The tables near the window (where we sat) are very close together, requiring me to squeeze my winter-padded ass between a bench and a potted plant any time I wanted to get to the bar. The bar tender didn't say a word to me aside from giving me my total ($10 for a glass of Riesling? Steep.) The Riesling was alright.

2.0,3/17/2011,"FOOD: Honestly, you've got to be kidding me. Just about every single main course was more than $25 while being only slightly larger than an appetizer. We ordered things as a group and shared them to try different things, and the food was good and full of flavor...buttttt...the portions were microscopic! I don't understand this, people are paying huge amounts of money for food, then the food is brought out on a humongous plate of which it occupies approximately 15% of the surface area! This is quite ridiculous. Anyway, it was our plan to order almost all of the main courses so thankfully there was (barely) enough food to go around. But this made the meal extremely pricey for us all (discussed later) relative to how much we ate. They have a full bar of drinks but again the glassware is small and the cost does not seem to match. I've never spent so much on a meal and been hungry so soon after, so I wasn't about to make the same mistake on drinks. That said, what I had tasted good, but this is fusion cuisine so while there are elements of French and elements of Vietnamese, there's not much to resemble either. This is not ""authentic"" by any stretch but it can still be enjoyed. I'll give credit where credit is due and say that they season things quite well, and that their sauces were very flavorful. However, after 5 bites your plate will be empty, and you will want more. 4/5SERVICE: Plain and simple the wait staff is haughty and condescending. Judging by the way they act you'd think YOU were the one serving them. They are not willing to take the time to make recommendations, basically when they show up they expect you to be ready to order, and as far as drinks go if you tell them you're OK once it becomes a battle to try and get them to notice your table again. I was not happy tip was built into our bill, otherwise it would have been a lot less. They frequently walked past the table (while empty handed) with diners raising their fingers/hands for attention, and when they did stop, they made their visits as brief as possible. They spoke with attitude, and their word choice was extremely casual and offputting, rather than professional. It was hard not to notice. The condescension in the air was thicker than the aromas of the food, and that's certainly not a good thing. 1/5AMBIENCE: Well decorated, but very yuppie style decoration. If that's your thing you'll love it, but if it's not, well, you won't. I do like the plants around the place though, but the place could use a bit more lighting. The music is rather loud and distracting, and takes away from the dining experience. This is not a classy place, this is a trendy place appealing to younger wannabe rich who haven't quite figured out how to exude class without trying too hard. 3/5PRICE/VALUE: This restaurant scores extremely poorly for value due to the size of the portions. They are tiny and the prices are quite high. To go with 9 other people and order all the main courses, and a couple of appetizers came to $50 a person BEFORE drinks. Some spent much more on drinks, so there were people spending $80 that night! And the worst part was since the portions were so small, most of us were hungry before bed. The food was good, but it is just not worth the price. I guess if the food was bad would be the only way to give 0/5 for this attribute, so it's a 1/5.SUMMARY: The portions are too small and the food, while good, just doesn't warrant that kind of spending if I'm going to be hungry in a few hours. Drinks are tiny and overpriced. Wait staff is very rude. A decent ambience just can't recover that. I will never go here again. 2/5",0,0,0,Raymond R.,"Manhattan, NY",0,22,1

I had a delicious mixed green salad, which was rather large so we shared and he got the spring roll, which was 1 roll - the flavor was ok but the mustard served with it made it much better. He got the bean curd that I'm guessing was good, as it disappeared no problem. I got the aged steak with shaved brussel sprouts - yes, real women eat beef, besides I'm from Texas, it was very good.

Unfortunately, I wasn't that hungry for dinner because I had had La Grenouille for lunch, so we ordered pretty light.  The three of us split the fried spring rolls  as an appetizer.  They were tasty, but when are spring rolls not? FYI,  you should wrap the spring roll in the lettuce that is served on the side (I learned this from my Asian coworker).   I felt like I could have gotten the same thing at any take out place for a 1/2 of the price.  The three of us then split 2 entrees: the spicy shrimp and the Glazed Duck Breast.  The spicy shrimp was good, but I was hoping for something more special.  If I was hungry I would have been left wanting more.   The duck was good, but also nothing special.

3.0,8/16/2010,"We went for a friend's birthday for Restaurant Week, but didn't actually choose the RW menu. I would recommend taking this route so you can taste as much as possible. OK, so the not so good first - the Grilled Eggplant app is definitely grilled. There is no mistaking that, but you really can't taste anything else. I wouldn't recommend it and I usually LOVE eggplant. The Sticky Rice is kind of undercooked and overdone. The Angel Hair Rice Noodle has potential, but is too tightly bound (you'll see if you order it) and I don't see how it pairs well with the mains on the menu. :-/ As Steph M. says, the Amok Cambodgien and Sticky Rice are AMAZING. Super super good. My friends really liked the Sea Bass and the Spicy Beef salad, too. Service is a bit spotty and confused. The waitstaff is meant to look modelly and international, but they're not exactly intelligent (that's harsh, i know, sorry :-/). Don't ask them for suggestions and don't confuse them with substitutions or things like ""I want my app to arrive with the mains..."" Oh, well. It is what it is.

3.0,7/27/2010,The Bad- Cheap chopsticks (sushi kind)- Spicy Beef Salad (beef was medium rare to raw--some pieces were literally not cooked; not spicy either more like salty beef salad)- Marinated Tofu Salad (appetizer--very salty so try to mix the salad with the sauce first before you dig in to the tofu)- Striped Bass (really salty but other than that it's fine)The Good- Cripsy Shrimp (crispy on the outside and inside has shrimp and string bean--sauce that comes with it is a good complement to it)- Fried Spring Roll (ordinary spring rolls but still tastes good)- Steamed Rice Angel Hair Noodles (i used this to dip in the Spicy Beef Salad--that is good; chef should mix it in there as a new dish)- Crab Cake (more of a fish taste rather than a crab taste)- Sticky rice (not that bad)- Hazelnut Mousse (tastes like ferrero rocher chocolate but bigger...i like it)The Bottomline- Worth checking out especially for the appetizers.

3.0,7/26/2010,"Walked into Indochine with 2 friends and noticed the place has nice decors. Very dark in the restaurant - most of the lights in this restaurants were supported by candles. (one on each table). Seating was alright. I thought the couches that were backed against the wall would be comfy but when I sat down it felt kind of cramped because the table is close that it was hard to get out to the bathroom. I guess we should have take the square shaped tables with the 4 legged chairs instead.Since this was restaurant week I went straight for the prix fixe meal. I was too full by the middle of my entree. I didn't I could even stomach the dessert. But since I am paying for this I meagerly took a couple bites of the cream brulee. Suggestions: If you are not a heavy eater, please do not go for prix fixe. It is hard to finish everything. And if you don't finish it - you'd feel that it wasn't worth your money. But don't force yourself on the food because of that. What I ordered:1) Appetizer: Crab Cakes (pretty good - I liked the green sauce that came with it. it was a bit spicy and tangy.)2) Entree: Hanger Steak it was ok. at least the steak was better than i had at other places. Last time I had steak and asked for medium it tasted overcooked and dry. At least this place makes it perfect with a little bit of pink inside. - Came with Sticky Rice : that was soso - I mean like you can find these in regular chinese restaurants and they make it better.3) Dessert: Creme Brulee (tasted like flan but it was better - it had a crunchy covering and it's like custard inside) Didn't finish it but I gave the rest to my friend.What my friend ordered and what I tried of his food:1) Appetizer: Marinated TofuEhh it was bleh - soso. The tofu was actually mixed with spicy sauce. Should have named it Spicy Tofu instead of Marinated Tofu. Sauce wasn't that great.2) Entree: Catfish - Too Salty and Spicy. Only thing I liked about the dish was the vegetables (believe its called Choy in chinese) that came along with it. 3) Dessert: Mango Coconut Sorbet: Great Dessert. Especially like the Mango ice cream. Problem with this: portions are so small. Not worth the money. But then again going through this menu from appetizer to Dessert makes you very full.We also had:-  the fried spring rolls (pretty good - just like the ones you can find in regular Vietnamese restaurants). Only thing that was better was presentation style- Crispy Shrimp(Okay this was my favorite appetizer!!!) MUST TRY!!- Steamed Rice Angel Hair Noodles with scallions and fried shallots (This was soso - bland; barely had any taste to it)- Spicy Beef Salad (Not that great; Didn't like that fact that the meat was practically raw in the dish, other than that the dish was fine)CONS:- EXPENSIVE$$$!! OUR BILL tallied up to about $180 for 3 people. I don't think the food we ate was worth $180.- Gave us bamboo chopsticks( the kind where you would find in a Chinese take out - very cheap) wrapped in a nice napkin. You'd expect silver knives and forks and spoons in the napkin not a cheap bamboo chopstick.- Kinda dark - Didn't really like the lighting effect",0,0,0,Teresa C.,"New York, NY",156,471,1940

3.0,6/9/2010,"I liked Indochine, I really did.. but I expected to be a little more impressed. Last I checked, opentable made this place look real good. I also often saw them on restaurant week menus. I can't pinpoint the exact thing that detracted from the the appeal of this restaurant. Who knows, when visiting I had a Kittichai like venue in mind. I suppose that's where I went wrong. I mean, It's trendy. You have your dark ambiance with loungey electronic music. There's a good vibe in here.. stucco ceilings, palm trees and decent decor (Minus the terrible bar stools that look like they came from some dumpy local watering hole) help it. You also have crowds that are fun to watch too. Theater groupies, NYU kids, artsy folks and aspiring 90 lb models reaking of  their cancer sticks (cigarettes). It's definitely entertaining. You'll be out of place if you're wearing anything more formal than trendy jeans and a slinky top. Indochine isn't pretentious and you're not going to break the bank eating here either. I love Vietnamese food. I love Thai food. Pan-asian? Yeah, more like pan in my mouth. Yum. I'm down with trendy fusion food. Bring on the coconut, lemongrass, curry powder, peanut sauce, mint, basil or whatever you fusiony masterminds have, I'll eat it ! Indochine does fusion.. and pretty well at that. I walked in expecting a more traditionalist Vietnamese menu, but that's like going to the olive garden and expecting real Italian food. Not going to happen. Our notable eats were as follows:Spicy shrimp dish - Cooked well, (I've eaten a lot of over cooked shrimp in my life). Very very very heavy on the basil. I love basil so this didn't bother me much. I'd measure spiciness at a 6.8/10. Nothing too crazy, especially for us whiteys.Amok Cambodgien - This was a filet of sole with coconut milk, and cabbage steamed in a banana leaf. Before eating this, I had no idea I liked cabbage. Yum. I wish the sole absorbed a little more of the coconut flavor as it was slightly bland. It's cute that it comes in a banana leaf. Sweet Rice- I ABSOLUTELY DID NOT want to give up this bowl to share. If you like coconut rice you will die for this. This was an amazing side that I was happy to eat by itself and vehemently defend from others.Sticky Rice - This was the polar opposite of the sweet rice. What the heck went wrong here? This tasted like day old Chinese fried rice with nasty dried shrimp mixed in. The shrimp reminded me of the little beasties that float around in Nisen Shrimp Cup-O-Noodles. Ewww.. I'm shocked to read the reviews about bad service. I experienced nothing like that. The waitress were not only fashionably dressed and individually beautiful, they were super accommodating. If we were caught staring blankly around the room looking for our waitress, another one would shuffle right over with a smile on her face.Final rating? 3.25 stars.

1.0,3/28/2010,"Oh Indochine. Where do I begin about my nightmare within your restaurant walls? I was here the other night with some friends. It was a weekend night, we had a 9:30 reservation and arrived at 9 to have a drink at the bar first. I had heard they had a good cocktail menu. Some of our party sat down in the lounge area while two of us went to the bar. I started out by trying the Pineapple Caipirinha (leblon cachaca, fresh pineapple juice, lime and brown sugar) which was just okay. I switched to the Indochine Martini (Svedka vodka infused with pineapple and ginger and fresh lime juice) later on. The Inchochine Martini was delicious. The bartender was super nice and helped us pick good drinks. As we were sitting there sipping out overpriced cocktails, one of my friends goes to open the shutters just a tad. We were all very hot sitting there in the lounge and delicately opened the shutters to get a bit more airflow. The manager comes over in a huff and says to us ""Seriously????"" in an unnecessary snotty tone, leans over us almost spilling our drinks everywhere and proceeds to slam the shutters closed. Listen, we are not a bunch of brats, we would have closed it up for you if you had said something humane to us that we could have  understood. We didn't say another word, and when I went up to the bar to get another round of drinks, I heard the manager telling the bartender to cut us off. Sir, we are all grown adults, we are not making a scene and we are spending money at your restaurant and about to sit for dinner. When the bartender told the manager we were rolling our bar bill into our dinner bill (keep in mind we had tipped the bartender handsomely at this point) the manager made a snide comment about how we are not staying for dinner and he was kicking us out. At this point I almost wanted to leave but thought it was worth sitting for the food. I had wanted to eat here for so long!When our party of 4 was finally seated, we were appalled. They tried to seat us in the very back in semi-circular table meant for 2. We were completely cramped with our elbows on top of each other. There were other 4 seater tables wide open. Don't play this game with me. I'm not some amateur 18 year old that was lucky to be served at the bar. I'm not a tourist or even out-of-towner. Your bad attitude doesn't impress me and I'm ridiculously turned off by your passive aggressive behavior. I went to the manager to complain about how small the table was and he said to me in a snide tone ""we sat you near the vents since your party insisted on being hot"". I should have left right then and there. I told him he can't punish us to a back corner, which he exclaimed he wasn't trying to do. He quickly moved around a few things and got us in a proper table meant for 4 people. Finally. We ordered and I had the wonton wrapped fried shrimp which were decent, they tasted like any other tempura. I also went with the sea bass entree, which had almost no flavor. It was on the verge of being overcooked, it was a bit dry. My other dining companions were severely disappointed with the food and gave me a hard time about choosing the place. Sorry guys!We paid the bill and left in a hurry. Terrible, terrible experience. The food wasn't even good. All I can say is that they made good cocktails, but it didn't make up for the totally unprofessional way we were treated. Indochine, I was rooting for you so hard. The menu looked so awesome and I was so excited to try you out. Too bad you were another experience I will make sure to share with others so no one else makes the mistake of paying for your services and mediocre food.",13,8,2,Lauren B.,"New York, NY",485,391,60
3.0,3/2/2010,"Restaurant week provided an affordable excuse for my friend to make us a reservation to try Indochine. Truthfully it was more like, ""Please come to Indochine with me, I've been wanting to go for sooooo long."" 5 minutes into our Indochine experience she turns to me and says, ""Hmmm, this isn't the place I thought it was, I've been HERE."" I had not, so on with the review!Our full party was a bit tardy and I had conveniently forgotten my cell phone at home as we waited to see if everyone would arrive or not. The staff was extremely nice and seated us with one person missing. We were seated at the back against the wall. Let's first talk about the seating at Indochine. I'm not sure when it was last renovated, but the seating leaves something to be desired. Not only is everyone seated atop one another, but the bench we sat on against the wall was so low that the legs of my 5 foot height fit firmly on the floor. That doesn't sound like a bad thing, right? Until you look across the table to see you're looking into the chest of a 6+ foot dining companion. This means I spent the meal looking up across the table while eating with the table almost at my shoulders. The restaurant week menu seemed well rounded. Amoungst the three of us we ordered the Asian Lump Crab Cakes and 2 Spicy Beef Salads. The portions were rather large and both were tasty. (I would have liked the salad a little more spicy, but it was made for the masses.)The main courses Grilled Salmon & Hangar Steak were also tasty, although the Salmon was quite over salted.  Very much so. Dessert -- we tried both the Classic French Lemon Tart and the Raspberry Sorbet. Yum!!!The waitress was great. The place was LOUD (one patron actually whistled really loud to get the room to silence and asked if everyone could take it down a notch!) and it was really tough for the patrons to get out of their seats to use the restroom. If they removed a few tables and there was more room and less noise it would greatly improve my review... the food was a 3.5... the staff great, but the layout... blah.",0,2,0,Kimberli M.,"New York, NY",124,423,156

Spring rolls and crab cakes were good but nothing special (spring rolls tasted like something you could get in any cheap pho place). Duck confit salad was a little more unique, and had good flavors. For my entree I had the duck with vidalia onion sauce and a side of the sticky rice. The duck was very tender and had great flavor from the vidalia onion and I was quite satisfied with my main dish. My experience was tainted by my waiter who spilled wine all over the tablecloth in front of me (instead of apologizing he just kept claiming that this had never happened to him before), and also his attitude at the end when he claimed that we had only tipped 13% (when we had calculated it out and were sure that we'd tipped over 15%).

5.0,8/3/2009,"I give this place 4 1/2 stars b/c it was close to perfect. i went here with a friend for restaurant week and it was well worth it. First off, the restaurant is located the first floor of an apartment building. It's a really cool idea. The ambiance was awesome with the perfect setting of lighting which is good for dates. The cuisine is a fusion of viet/french which are 2 good mixes of food in this world. Since it was prefixe, everything was $35 plus $15 for the wine pairing. I have to admit, I was really surprised and here's why: We started off with the crab cakes & the lamb loin and an extra order of their ravioli thinking of since it was restaurant week/prefixe it might be small and we are both hungry as heck. But guess what when the plates came, we actually thought the plates was a the main course for another table but they were ours. We were like WOW, these are pretty big portions for a fancy samcy restaurant u know. After eating all three appetizers, I really recommend them too. The crab cakes were not dry and actually taste as fresh of what I got in Maryland with a little asian flair.The loin was awesome....we actually thought we were eating steak! The ravioli was steamed and it remind me of something from dim sum! This all came with a glass of rose. Next was the main course where we had the hanger steak w/ taro fries and sheared sea bass. Again the portions was huge! Most places that do prefixe u get only 1 piece of fish smaller than your cellphone well not here. Here u get 2 full pieces! And for steak, u get all of the goodness. This again came a with a glass of wine. Shoot we had to force ourselves to finish the food b/c it was too much and very tasty. But we still had dessert coming. The Creme Brulee was not your normal size dessert. It was the size of a big circle coaster! and again with a glass of dessert wine. I only gave it a 4 1/2 because the food was awesome, so was the service and wine selection. It would have gotten a 5 if there was more spacing in the tables and the bass which was very fresh and yummy was a little too salty for me but again I'm sensitive to the salt. So recap: $35 prefixe = 3 course meal with huge portions $15 wine pairing = 3 FULL glasses of very fine wine.

The spicy chicken, in particular, tasted like something I could have gotten for $9.95 at one of my favorite takeout places.The ambiance was top-notch, though. It felt exclusive and intimate, but not intimidating. The music was excellent. The drinks were tasty but expensive ($7 for a standard beer, $12 for a mojito). But what isn't in New York?In sum, I don't think I'd come back anytime soon, but I don't regret trying it.",2,1,1,Barrett S.,"New York, NY",43,69,0
4.0,1/21/2009,"On a snowy eve, I met Paula here for a restaurant week dinner. What a menu for RW! I love when I can choose between more than 2 things for my entree. And the decision was difficult indeed. I had the crispy bean curd salad and the spicy chicken, both of which were quite delicious. The sorbet for dessert tasted suspiciously like haagen dazs, but that doesn't make it bad. Paula had the king crab spring rolls, which, judging by how quickly they disappeared, were quite good! The presentation was beautiful, and the pace was nice and slow, perfect for a lazy Sunday dinner when I wanted to catch up with a friend.Side note: celebrity spotted! Brooke Shields came in for dinner with her beau while we ate. I didn't recognize her because I am celebrity-inept, but Paula pointed her out for me. She is very tall.

1.0,7/25/2008,"This place is so transparent! It's all bells and whistles with no substance. The moment you step in this place, it's so obvious that you're paying to see skinny models in a luxuriously faux vietnamese atmosphere. Indochine's attempts to lavish you in an over-the-top exotic locale will never cover the fact that the food is terrible here.The food was not authentic and their take on ""French-Vietnamese"" is pretentious and gratuitous. The portions look like it's only meant for a tasting menu except everything tasted like garbage. Their bartenders do not know how to mix drinks, I asked for a Kir Royale and I got an overcharged nasty, sweet-tasting swill.

I asked for a kir royale and they served me a drink that was so flat and syrupy, I may as well have drank a bottle of NyQuil.Ultimately, the combination of bad food and poorly made drinks made me sick.

3.0,2/10/2008,"This should really be a 3.5 star rating bc I will probably still be back, though probably not in a hurry. I liked the spacious and dimly lit interior, though I do think the painted palm fronds on the walls could have been more expertly executed. I did like it that the tables were far enough apart to lend some privacy to conversation and not give one the feeling of being too intimate with other diners or passerby. I think it would be a nice place for a quiet candlelit dinner date. I, too, was surprised to find a pair of disposable chopsticks in my cloth napkin bc it seemed a little out of sync with the fancy sexy vibe they seemed to be going for.That aside, the food was all beautifully presented. I wanted to take pictures but apparently people look down on that at these nicer establishments. I ordered the lamb loin appetizer and found it to be flavorful, though a tad overboard. The green salad was great. Prawns, not so great. They were a bit charred, so the burnt taste overpowered everything. My favorite was the vegetarian fried bean curd dish, which was delicious and only $10! I will definitely be ordering that next time.",1,0,0,Melody H.,"New York, NY",178,286,0

While in theory the cuisines are different, the actual menu items are very similar in description and ingredients, so the comparison is easy. The quality of the dishes was very good, but I wasn't excited or blown-away by any of the flavors or combinations like at Kittichai.  There wasn't a single dessert we wanted to try, whereas at Kittichai we split 3 (and would have ordered more as well)!!The decor is very Casablanca-banana leaf-linen pants. It's relaxing  but I guess not what I was expecting.  The servers are all Amazonian models-in-training wearing some sort of barely-there black dress.

I think I know how many people are in my family,"" my sister responded dryly.   Yeah... that shut the bitch up real nice.   Seconds later, we were seated at a table.My sister and I shared appetizers:  We had the crab cakes and the Vietnamese ravioli, both of which were absolutely fabulous.   My father had a very aromatic soup which he greatly enjoyed as well.  He followed it up with the Salmon, which he said was absolutely divine.  My sister had the tuna special, and I had the spicy chicken...  Wow!!  The dish, made mostly of lean white chicken pieces, was so damn tasty, with the chicken rich in flavor and juicy.   I haven't had chicken so well prepared in a very long time.   We accompanied our meal with a bottle of Barrel 27 Pinot Noir, which was still a bit green but showed lots of potential.Dinner was fabulous and we truly ate wonderfully.   If you haven't been to Indochine, you really should give it a shot!",4,3,4,David O.,"Walnut Creek, CA",142,1310,1131

5.0,1/25/2007,"Restaurant week in New York, hundreds of places to choose from, one price, and a damn hard time making decisions!  We settled on Indochine after discovering that our first choice only participated in restaurant week for lunch.  I have to say I'm glad it turned out that way because I loved it.  I had the ribs for an appetizer, the lamb for the entree, a side of the house rice, and the pear tart for dessert.  It was fantastic!  The ribs were cooked to perfection and were incredibly delicious.  The lamb was to die for, definitely ranks up there as one of the best lamb dishes I've ever had, and I'm a fan of lamb.  The house rice was pretty simple: shrimp, peas, and egg but it was a great companion to the lamb.  The pear tart for desert was the perfect finish to an excellent meal.Indochine's normal prices are actually pretty reasonable and they don't give you supermodel portions like most trendy restaurants, they actually give you enough to leave the place full which is a nice change from the usual.The staff is also very friendly and accommodating.  Our waitress was nice, polite, and welcoming.  Overall I'd definitely recommend Indochine and I plan on bringing others here in the future.",1,0,1,Devin L.,"Los Angeles, CA",16,50,4

We shared a fried banana with coconut ice-cream dessert which was also tasty!  Frankly, I didn't expect Indochine to be around after so many years given the short life span of ""uber"" trendy restaurants but, I have to say, it's still quite reliable when it comes to serving good food.",2,0,1,Soozie H.,"San Francisco, CA",89,499,2

3.0,2/13/2006,"A trendy yet mellow asian themed restaurant with dim lights, a breezy but upscale island feel, and sharable plates, Indochine makes a great date place. The food itself was good, but not spectacular, but the total package is a good one. To start, my friend and I had the spring rolls which were light and suprisingly flavorful. The lightly dressed celery-like vegetable in the spring rolls were well complemented by the sticky plum sauce - unlike many spring rolls that taste like you just ate a bunch of raw vegetables wrapped in sticky rice paper, this one did not leave you feeling empty, The highly recommended sea bass in black bean chili sauce and ginger sesame soy with bok choy was a bit disappointing - it was slightly overcooked and the flavors of the sauce did not soak through the fish. The boned duck with ginger and steamed vegetables was delicious though. Using ginger has the potential to overpower the meat, but the duck was softly cooked and lightly bathed in a fragrant ginger broth that was slightly sweet. An interesting dish that was well thought out. We also ordered the sticky rice with black mushrooms and chinese sausage, which was good, but nothing special if you're used to eating Chinese food. Although the food was generally quite good, the service was not so. Our pretty server let us (and other tables) wait too long and too often between dishes and even to get the check. A little improvement on that end may have made this experience a little better.

Oh yeah and for some reason it felt a bit European. The light setting is dim in the front but really opens up in the middle and towards the end. As for noise level... bring your hearing aid aid ;-) but the seating distance between people is close enough to hear what your saying... and when you are with good company the noise just becomes part of the background. The interior design is very appealing and the fresh flower/plant arrangements just add to the whole experience.  The hostess:There are several... but I wasn't a big fan of one of the hostess at first but I think she warmed up to me.
