5.0,4/5/2019,"History, history, history!  This restaurant is located in what used to be the original JP Morgan bank vault from 1902. All around, you are surrounded by old deposit boxes when you dine in the main dining area. I had the caprese salad, chilean sea bass and mac and cheese and NY cheesecake. Caprese salad was  very good and even had roasted tomatoes. The mac and cheese was phenomenal! So creamy and cheesy! The chilean sea bass was surrounded by steamed veggies and soupy (I tried capturing it in my picture attached). The cheesecake with strawberry drizzle was very rich and creamy! My husband had the caprese salad, filet mignon,   Roasted potatoes and ny cheesecake. He really enjoyed the mignon  (med rare) and recommends at this steak house. The roasted potatoes were very well seasoned and complimented the mignon and Chilean sea bass well. I gave this steak house 5 stars for several reasons:Part of its history, its location ( across NYSE), friendly and knowledgeable staff ( a staff member gave us a brief history of the JP Morgan vault). Very clean restrooms and facility overall. As for price I am not sure of the price because I went with a work group that arranged a group discount. If you visit the financial district go in, enjoy a drink, dinner or lunch and sit back and enjoy a part of NY history!!!",0,0,0,Yari S.,"Miami, FL",0,11,18

4.0,3/25/2019,"Just had a great meal.  Shakeel, our server, took excellent care of us.Steak was cooked perfectly.  Crab cakes were just alright. Creamed spinach, mushrooms were good, hash browns also just alright.Try the Lava Cap cabernet, one of the bargains on the menu.",0,0,0,S M.,"Pleasantville, NY",0,1,0
1.0,3/24/2019,"Food was just ok and my server was nice and attentive, but one of the waiters with the deep NYC accent basically yelled at me and my son for walking around near the bar after we ate. This guy was just extremely angry and rude and the other waiters and bartenders seemed very angry. The place was only about 20% full which didn't surprise me considering how bad Bobby Vans has gotten over the years. This restaurant lost my business for good after this experience. There are 5 other better steak houses with better service within a few blocks of this place.  Furthermore, the sidewalks outside the restaurant always smell like dog urine.",0,0,0,Craig C.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,8,1

The food was average.  Fresh but not amazing.  Peter Luger and Del Frisco's are amazing.  Had the porterhouse for two, I thought it was small.  My wife had the crab cakes.  She wasn't impressed.  Also orders the fries, calamari, creamed spinach and Cobb salad.   All of it was ok.  The fries portion was too small relative to what I was seeing at other tables.  The calamari was seasoned well but wasn't crispy, it sat in the kitchen for a while.",0,0,0,Manual W.,"Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",0,36,0
1.0,3/15/2019,"The Indian male waiter shakeel, he is the server on my receipt. he is so rude n lack customer service. We can here for a birthday dinner and was rushed because we got here at 945 our reservation time n the kitchen closed at 10pm. I ordered creme bur la 'dont know if I spelled that right but whatever"". The desert n he brought it out cold. When my bf ask isn't the pose to be warm which it can be, he lies n said no. I order that desert all the time, so I shouted yes it can be warmed. That's not all he brought our check before we was even done dining. The list goes on n on of things he did. Smh. Ooo n I asked the same waiter to ask the manger to see the volt n he said he dont think its possible, come to find out he never asked the manager for us. But in the end I got to see the volt that's why I really came here n because my bf asked the manager he allowed us to. Food was good. But honestly because of him I didnt enjoy my time here. N the only reason I didn't report him is because I dont want it to be on my heart if he gets written up n eventually loose his job. But I'm sure other people will complain on him soon.

2.0,3/10/2019,"My boyfriend and I did a staycation in the financial district, instead of going to a nice sushi spot we decided on a random steakhouse because my boyfriend was starving. The ambiance is very old but not in a chic way, tourists probably go here a lot and older people. The food was okay, we got oysters and calamari and two steaks. Calamari wasn't great just super fried and covered in Parmesan I think? It was weird. This is definitely like a sports bar with steak kind of place.They don't have a drink or cocktail menu, they have a wine list. They said they had a full bar and it took up a large part of the restaurant but When we asked for two drinks that are pretty common (Tom Collins and Hemingway daiquiri) the server asked the bartender and came back asking us how to make the drinks. They came back in a large cup with ice and it reminded me of when I ordered vodka cranberries at a crappy club unfortunately.They need a bit of a re model and definitely real bartenders .",1,0,2,Ally R.,"New York, NY",28,21,18

The service was excellent  from the host to the waiter's and the rest of the staff.We had grilled octopus, ceaser salad, clams casino, oysters Rockefeller and veal meatballs,all excellent. Then main course of filet mignon and 28 day dry aged rib eye steak, both were excellent .had a Groupon deal also, then we wanted to see the vault in the basement and on the weekend it's closed so the host took us downstairs for a tour of the vault which was a treat to see.

5.0,3/1/2019,"Had not been to Bobby Van's in a while but saw a Groupon deal and decided to go and was very happy we did. The hostess and waiter were very friendly and did not treat us any differently because of the Groupon which was must appreciated.The food was excellent! We started with the Baked Clams which were wonderful and for entrees we had the Chilean Sea Bass, the Lamb Chops and the Bone-in Ribeye, none of which disappointed. If anything, though the Apple Strudel for dessert was good, perhaps we had expected more.  Nevertheless, looking forward to going back to Bobby Van's with or without Groupon.",0,0,0,Andrew L.,"New York, NY",2,86,186
1.0,2/24/2019,"Well I have to say I was beyond disappointed in Bobby Vans Broad Street. My husband and I brought my sister to celebrate her birthday.  I had made a reservation, but when we arrived, it was not in the system. We were a large party, and I was relieved that they could accommodate us anyway.  The server was very sweet and efficient.  We ordered appetizers, which were very good and came out in a timely matter. After that, it was a disaster. We waited and waited for our main course, close to an hour. And when it did come, my husbands skirt steak was ice cold. He was furious, as we waited so long, and this is how it came out? My son and I had the porterhouse for two, I ordered it medium, and it came out rare. Both were sent back. We started to eat our sides, rather than letting them sit there and get cold. We were told that 3 sides would be plenty for our party size of 7. The roasted corn side was literally served in a saucer, that was more like a single serving portion.  When we did get our steaks, they were just meh.  At the end of our meal, the server said, that the manager was sending over complimentary dessert. Very nice thought, but didn't even give us a choice. Sent out 4 slices of cake, for 7 people? Hmmmm.  We won't be going back after this debacle, there are too many other great steakhouses in Manhattan.",0,0,0,Marilyn S.,"TriBeCa, Manhattan, NY",5,32,0
5.0,2/23/2019,"Once again, although we approached this establishment with a Groupon, we were again treated very well.   Our server was a perfect young gentleman by the name of Victor. Victor was astoundingly patient after one individual in our party was the one that made the error by asking for the wrong dish.  In point of fact, what happened was one of this classic ""I've changed my mind, I will have what you're having"" to unconsciously promote more competition.  Although the order had already been placed, Victor was able to immediately notify all the team players and all was rectified to the customer's satisfaction.  The lack of drama and total understanding was as refreshing as a cold glass of lemonade on a blisteringly hot summer afternoon. I was actually impressed by the Moules Marniere which I make at home a lot.  I have to concede this was the best version I've ever had in my life.  The last time I saw garlic so thinly sliced was in the famous prison scene from the movie GOODFELLAS.  Further, the mussels were fresh and were not too salty as was the case with the sauteed spinach and chimi churri sauce that accompanied a beautifully cooked skirt steak. The Filet Oscar never fails to impress at 14 oz and they know how to prepare it well. Our water was always refilled and I would have to say that Victor was the highlight of the evening as he knew when to approach and when to leave us to our devices as they say. This is my second time at the restaurant and I was grateful that our server understood that we did not want the calamari sweet thai sauce appetizer to be too oily.  He was able to convey the instructions perfectly to the chef who in turn provided perfection. In this manner, I saw improvements from my last time at BV's.   The servers again have made it easy for me to leave a perfect give star rating.",1,1,1,A A.,"Rego Park, NY",33,323,0

4.0,2/13/2019,"Came on a Saturday night and the place was relatively empty. Because it's right by the stock exchange, the roads are blocked off to cars. If you're planning on dropping people off, you can't really drop them off right in front of the restaurant entrance. Waiter was relatively nice, no complaints about the service. My table ordered the fried calamari, crab cake, and grilled octopus salad for the appetizer. The calamari was crunchy and nicely breaded. The crab cakes were also quite good flavor wise, but was a bit cold. The octopus in the salad was very soft. For the mains, I had a sirloin with a side of asparagus and mashed potatoes. I would say the sirloin was mediocre... it tasted like what it was--beef, but I wasn't blown away by it or anything. The mash was great like everyone says. It was so creamy and flavorful. I tried some of my friend's Chilean sea bass, and that was pretty good. Overall, food was good and I had no big problems with any of it, but I probably wouldn't come again as nothing was incredibly great.",0,0,0,Bryn M.,"New York, NY",9,70,20

My dad ordered the fried octopus appetizer and that is a portion for sharing. The rest of table ordered cream of corn, burger, sirloin and porterhouse.

1.0,12/23/2018,"The prices are fair for the market value, but not for the restaurant itself. The steak did not taste as fresh as a $140 porterhouse should taste. I know good meat when I eat it and this was NOT good. Hispanic waiter was extremely rude and not knowledgeable at all. I asked him which side was the Tenderloin and which side was the strip. He shrugged and then made a guess, and of course was wrong. His uniform was filthy and was tattered at the bottom. I wouldn't expected any better, these people have no business.  The environment of this restaurant is rustic, but not in a good way. The lighting is too bright, the floors creek, and the music is not appropriate for the environment; It's too loud and cheesy. The restaurant was nearly empty and out steak took forever to come out. When it did come out, it was okay, not good not bad. Side dishes were expensive at I believe $10 a pop. Asparagus was not properly skinned, mashed potatoes did not have enough flavor to be called ""garlic mashed potatoes"" and the creamed spinach wasn't properly creamed.

1.0,12/7/2018,If I could it would be 0 stars. Being myself in the industry for 15 years working myself at a steak house I would give 0 stars. Had to waive for bread the appetizers came before the bread. The steak came cold and So did the spinach. Waist of time and money. They were more paying attention to the party that they were setting up. Our to begin waiter didn't even check on us. The manger felt proud for 28$ discount on a horrible piece of cold steak. And they offered dessert in the end .... guess what we were charged for it. We did have Groupon which we payed 140$ for it. I don't think we deserved the horrible service because of the Groupon.

3.0,8/31/2018,Nice lunch with the family before heading out on a afternoon cruise. They even have kids options not on menu so a nice addition with young children.  Right across the street from the NYSE so clientele is according during the day but very comfortable feel. I wore a golf shirt with shorts and sneakers and fit right in. If this was dinner it would definitely be slacks and a nice shirt at a minimum. Ordered the 14oz filet and creamed spinach. Very good but steak was undercooked. Also my daughter ordered sliders and asked medium well. They came out medium rare and of course she would not eat them so that was a waste. Can't wait for reorder when everyone else would be done by that time. Oh well gave it a try...,0,0,0,Bryan L.,"Brooklyn, NY",12,171,126

2.0,8/11/2018,"Not quite what was expected. Came with a group of co-workers during resraurant week for the lunch special. We all thought everything was lackluster. The soup was overloaded with parsley and too salty. The salads were room temperature - not cold like a good salad should be. Steaks were decently cooked mostly, but one was way overcooked (should have been medium well). The mashed potatoes are pretty bad - they tasted very artificial. Green sauce that's provided with the steaks is on the spicey side, so be aware of that. The tuna steak was so-so, the glaze didn't do much for it though. Our largest issue was how long the food took to come out. We waited a good 45 minutes + and the place was not overly packed (thanks for making us late back to work). All in all, its just way to overhyped and not worth the price.",0,0,0,Steve S.,"New York, NY",2,110,0

4.0,7/8/2018,"This review is for the food and a nod (kudos) to Bobby Van's for still doing business in downtown particularly in this building. The building is a historical landmark, it used to be a JPMorgan Bank. A decade ago, I took my parents to Bobby Van's (before Groupon existed) at this location because of the history and what this building represented. I also had dinner here a few times over the past few years. The food hasn't changed at all minus the smaller portions and increased prices. Recently I brought a Groupon deal and used it for dinner. It was a great deal ($200) for steak but if you come here with 4 people, you will inevitably end up spending more than $200 because you will order an entree or appetizers for the table. It makes sense for a business to entice people to walk in the door knowing they will spend more overall.I recalled how it used to be packed on the weekend but now there were a few empty tables and the private dining area downstairs in the basement is closed. They will only open for private events or corporate functions.Alas, gone are the days when Wall Street titans brokered deals during power lunches and fine dined their clients at dinner behind these walls or at the vault. During a recent visit last year, I asked for a tour of the lower level / basement. The wait staff were gracious enough to show us the bar, dining area and vault downstairs. We saw the safety deposit boxes and bonds framed on the wall, what magnificent stories each deposit box holds if they can speak.A sad reminder of the glorious Wall Street days which the neighborhood is now mostly a residential area. If Bobby Van's is a reflection of the old vs. new Wall Street, one can easily see the irony that an institution previously frequented predominantly by power brokers is now filled with tourists and locals (who also brought the Groupon deals like myself).",1,1,1,Vivian L.,"New York, NY",62,290,913
2.0,7/2/2018,"NEED BETTER CUSTOMER SERVICE! THEY DID NOT ACKNOWLEDGE REQUESTS. Now the food I ordered was ""good"" overall. Really enjoyed the steak, mash potatoes and warm spinach salad. Didnt really like the baked Mac and cheese...not my style of ""baked"" as only a thin layer seemed to actually be baked... once you dig in it seems like stove top Mac  and cheese. Cheese was very watery!So onto the  customer service... IT WAS NOT GOOD!  There were literally 10 people in the restaurant (if that) and a few wait staff one hr after they opened.I purchased and used a Groupon which was easy to redeem. Waiter just took phone to redeem but you could also print out voucher to just give to them. What annoyed me was the waiter kept mentioning it throughout dinner like "" you sure you don't want to order this steak instead since you have a Groupon or that""... it was borderline I'm trying to help you get your monies worth/ yet borderline annoying because I'm treating someone and they didn't need to hear every second a Groupon was being used.The waiter was acting like it was too hard to answer questions. Very impatient while we were there. 1st. I initially requested a booth over the phone during my reservation and mentioned when arrived that I would like a booth. Yet the waiter still sat us at table w/o any acknowledgement that a booth was requested twice. Another couple came behind us and they put them in ""booth area"" . Then when I mentioned to  someone that I requested a booth (assuming he was  a manager/ maybe reservationist) he said they don't really have booths for two people although he sat another couple in a booth area. But, showed me another corner like you can move there if you like. It was ""booth like"" as well but too close to the bar where people were sitting, so decided to just stay at the table. Why was that never mentioned during my reservation or when I arrived?2nd. We wanted to order something else before leaving and was inquiring about the boneless wings and if it was a ""good size portion"" or small? And the waiter kept impatiently responding ""it's an appetizer"" ""it's an appetizer size"". I said yes we know we are asking like is this like a few small nuggets? Are there like  4 or 8 wings? we want to just see if that's worth ordering or if we should choose something else. The waiter was constantly acting like he was too busy to explain with an attitude...Which was annoying and rude! Lastly, ordered dessert and told waiter to go. He came back with our dessert on plates (very cold tasting creme brûlée with no toppings on it. It was $10 which should have had a piece of fruit or something on it for that)..But after we repeated we wanted it to go He replies ""they can't make it to go"", and just put it down on the table with the spoons and walked away. Again why didn't the waiter mention when we ordered that they can't make that to go? So we can order another dessert? Also had cheesecake to go that was $11 and very plain as well. Possibly best to order one dessert & share with another person. Can also go to a bakery or dessert place after to get better quality dessert for cheaper. FYI: The Capital Grille has given  me creme brûlée to go when I dined there and it was better tasting!...I don't see why the waiter would  bring out dessert we don't want to eat now and have an attitude about it.. So we ate a few scoops and scrapped out the rest into a togo container to eat later. So just think twice before dinning at this location.

5.0,6/14/2018,"Continuing my celebration in the great New York City, my girlfriend took me here for dinner. She's a bargain hunter (which I love) so she found this place on Groupon. DUH. If you don't know me by now you should know both of us LOVE Groupon for all sorts of things. Anyway, so this AWESOME steakhouse is available on there so she HAD to bring me here! Here's how it went...Atmosphere/Appearance: Set at the bottom of the Manhattan island in the Wall Street district is this amazing restaurant. It exudes elegance through and through. I mean it should... it's Wall Street... LOTS of money and fancy people walk around this area! Lol. Wood floors, wood chairs, wood window frames and wood EVERYTHING just give this place so much class. Not to mention the super high 25-foot ceilings with multiple huge chandeliers hanging above your head add to the ambiance of dining somewhere exclusive. We ate in the main dining room so we didn't get to explore much, but apparently there's an eating area which used to be an old bank vault! Now that's cool. Our reservations were originally for 7:00pm, but due to some quick thinking and planning we decided to have them moved up to 4:00pm and it wasn't a hassle at all. It was then why we found out this place is on Groupon. It was DEAD in here. 4:00pm on a FRIDAY?! Maybe because it was the Friday before Memorial Day, but c'mon. This place should've been crawling with nice suits, young interns and the like for happy hour, plus to celebrate a week's worth of winnings! No matter, it was nice to eat in such a peaceful and quiet environment. It almost felt as if baby had bought out the whole restaurant... just for lil' ol' me. Now I'm starting to blush. Anyway, back to the review!Service: Victor was AWESOME. Since it was slow he could spend more time with us chatting about any and everything since I like to strike a good conversation for any reason. He had been there 25 years and has a pretty thick Albanian accent. He's really sweet and will definitely take care of you. We wanted for nothing because he was always one step ahead of the game.Food: As good as expected and even better. A complimentary bread platter is brought out with your drinks that features several kinds of bread with house made butter. Branded, packaged and everything. Pretty neat. We had a whole Groupon dollar amount to spend so we HAD to indulge! We started off with some shrimp cocktail. Big, thick cocktail shrimp that worked out at Powerhouse Gym that you wouldn't want to meet in a dark alley kinda big. Delicious though and is served with 2 kinds of sauce. Next we had the Sliced Tomato and Buffalo Mozzarella Salad. Amazing. It's basically a caprese salad, but with a twist. You get 3 huge slices of tomato, with 3 even bigger slices of mozzarella cheese then on each you get a different variety of topping. I couldn't tell you exactly what was on each one, but just know... they were all delicious. That was enough for appetizers because we have to eat the entree, right?! I went with their 14oz ounce filet. The biggest filet I've ever seen offered anywhere. I also added a side of their sauteed mushrooms and asparagus. I need my vegetables, I'm a growing boy. The steak was phenomenal. Cooked perfectly, great char on the outside and was ridiculously juicy. The mushrooms were just as good. Grab a fork-full with every bite of steak and you're golden. Asparagus was okay... it was simple. No one makes it as good as I do. Lol. This would definitely be my go-to place if I'm feeling fancy. That filet and the mushrooms would do be in just right. I wouldn't need anything else.Value: The fun part. We had $200.00 to spend. I have no idea what baby paid for the Groupon, but I know it wasn't close to $200.00. Lol. So let's get down to what you all want to know. How much does stuff cost?! I'll just run through a list to make it easy. The 4 shrimp cocktail will run you $20.00. Totally worth it in my opinion. Our Buffalo Mozzarella was $18.00, not quite worth it for some tomato, mozzarella and vegetables, but it was good. My 14oz filet was $55.00 and worth every penny. Maybe more to be honest, but I won't tell them that. Shh... The side of asparagus was $12.00. Granted, they were huge stalks, but you get like 8-9, eh... kinda worth it I guess. Just don't let them go to waste. My love's Chilean Seabass was $38.00. The mushrooms were $9.00. You get like a HEAP of them. Totally worth it. Overall, the food here is certainly worth the money even without a Groupon, but now that we've been spoiled with one, we will not come here without it. Lol.In conclusion, this place is awesome.

4.0,6/3/2018,"We ( 2 adults and 2 kids) got a Groupon deal for the restaurant. Although we were late (because of the trains but that's a different review), we were seated fairly quickly. Then again it wasn't very crowded. Our waiter was friendly and helpful. The restaurant use to be an old bank. Inside it has been nicely renovated. (You can have a private party in a bank vault. Now to the important part, the food. We ordered an appetizer of bacon, a porterhouse, a ribeye, Mac and cheese, parmesan truffle fries, and garlic mashed potatoes. The bacon was a little disappointing. They were thick and smelled great but wasn't flavorful. They were just salty and chewy. The porterhouse was okay. It wasn't the best I've ever had. We ordered it medium rare and it came out a little rare which was okay. There wasn't that much of a beefy flavor though. The ribeye was the best. It was done perfectly medium rare. It had great flavor. The best side was the garlic mashed potatoes. It didn't look appetizing but it was garlicky, buttery, and delicious. It went fast. The Mac and cheese was a little watery and didn't have much cheese flavor. The greatest disappointment had to be the fries. They were mediocre at best with some being soggy and limp. There was almost no truffle taste and the bits of parmesan mostly lay at the bottom of the plate. Very disappointing for $14.Overall it was a good meal. Some dishes were better than others. I would like to go back and try their other appetizers. The choices looked amazing.",1,0,0,Angela L.,"Queens, Queens, NY",2,96,23
5.0,5/29/2018,"I was so excited to try this place, and only did because of the Groupon for $200 worth of food at this location. The service was good, not great for an establishment that charges these prices, but it was fairly slow on this early Friday evening/late afternoon so we were able to catch our waiter walking by if we needed him. While they didn't lurk around watching, we certainly got refills of water when needed and asked if I wanted another glass of wine as soon as I finished it. Now, onto the food. We each had shrimp cocktail and split an order of Sliced Tomato & Buffalo Mozzarella salad. The only think I couldn't done without during this entire meal was this salad. It was ok, but I learned I prefer traditional Caprese Salad over this, so I'd skip this $18 appetizer in the future. Eric had the 14 oz filet mignon and I went for the Chilean Sea Bass after reading the rave reviews for it. While I didn't try it, I heard the filet was excellent and I definitely checked it out and can confirm it was cooked to the perfect temperature! My bass was cooked perfectly, the dish as a whole may have been a tad bit salty but I like salt so it was still good, it just kept me drinking my water. My guy also had the mushrooms and asparagus as sides and didn't complain about any of it! The mushrooms were good, I tried those too. Anyway, all in all I'm very glad we checked this place out and I'd definitely by that Groupon again and head here next time I'll be in the area, I just may opt for the filet next time.

My rib eye this time was just okay. Not real tender or flavorful as it was before. Veggies were nothing to rave about and pricey. Spouse then had the lamb chops which were dry and over cooked.

Also told him about the web site menu choices and why we came back and our disappointment in the slow wait service/menu outdated etc. He said he had brought the online menu problems to the upper management but to no avail apparently.

4.0,4/7/2018,"I had an awesome Groupon deal for this Bobby Van's location, so I made my way downtown after work to meet up with my sister.This location has the typical stodgy and formal NYC steakhouse decor, but being Good Friday, the atmosphere was quite relaxed with very few customers and most of the staff were not busy.- Let's start with the ever important steakhouse bread bowl.Contained in the bread bowl were three varieties; plain rolls, raisin bread, and thin crisp crackers.The best was the raisin bread which had a good amount of plump raisins and a pleasant sweetness.- For a starter we selected the Veal Meatballs with Mozzarella. Served on a hot cast iron skillet, the medley of melted Mozzarella and marinara sauce was very good, as I also tasted several herbs like oregano and basil.The meatballs were nicely textured and had a distinctive sweet mild flavor when compared to beef, especially dry-aged beef.- For entrees we each ordered the Prime 28-day dry-aged Bone-in Ribeye (cooked to the de-facto medium rare), and after the second bite, we each proclaimed it to be one of the better steaks we've eaten!The beef was really tender and had that funky dry-aged flavor which is pretty hard to describe, but you will know it when you taste it!The fattier pieces were divinely seared. The decadent beef fat was rendered to the amazing threshold where the fat slowly melted perfectly in my mouth.- For accompanying sides we opted for roasted corn and sweet potato french fries.Both were solid, but neither were particularly special nor noteworthy as a ""must"" try.At this point I have to mention Bobby Van's steak sauce. Note I DO NOT use steak sauce for any steak, and it would be near blasphemy to taint a Prime dry-aged steak with a sauce, so I sampled the sauce using the fries.The sauce was so interesting, reminiscent of the Chinese ""duck"" sauce served at takeout restaurants, albeit leaning more to the savory end.I hate to admit it, but it was quite addicting!- For dessert Bobby Van's offers standard fare like NY Cheesecake, Chocolate Cake, Creme Brulee, Mixed Berries, Ice Cream/Gelato, but we selected the Apple Strudel which caught our eye as being ""house-made.""The first positive sign was an audible crackle of the puff pastry when I dove my fork into the strudel; a required trait for a strudel in my opinion.The apple filing was welcomingly comprised mostly of apple slices and a lightly thickened syrup and not the overly sweet and thick syrup found in many strudels.Served a la mode, the vanilla ice cream on top was of solid quality which was appreciated.- Service was solid, but nothing remarkable.Overall, I would suggest going light on the appetizers and sides, so one can enjoy an entire steak!",7,3,8,Edward C.,"Matawan, NJ",163,350,1427

2.0,12/21/2017,"For me, steakhouses are about a standard. Especially when it comes to how red meat is cooked. Which is why I write of my profound disappointment last night and would warn fellow customers to beware.To be brief, we ordered a burger medium to share in addition to the rest of our meal (we eat family style). It took about 20/25 minutes for the burger to come out, a little surprising given the place was about 15% full at this time. The delay is one thing, and it happens - tho when the burger arrived it was clearly raw and it was visibly raw given the kitchen had kindly split it into two portions for us to share. I have experience in hospitality, and that someone would let that meat leave the kitchen on a medium order is just not good business.We asked the waiter to take the burger back and to have it brought up to a medium. This time when it came back, it was charred thru and thru, a well done meat that would be considered too dry for a bolognese sauce to disguise. We didn't say anything further, just ate what we wanted and asked for the check and left as it's not our responsibility to point out such basics.

2.0,11/15/2017,"Bobby Van's came highly recommended. Unfortunately, the place did not live up to the hype. The restaurant was about 3/4 full when we arrived. We were put at a table in the middle of nothingness, despite the fact there were other tables available. My friend and I both ordered the mixed green salad, we split a side of fries and both ordered 10oz fillet medium rare. They brought out bread to start the meal. The bread was average at best, with not much variety. There was a small Italian roll cut in half, a raisin roll and some melba toast with sesame seeds and dried onion.The salads arrived served in a nice bowl and were a substantial portion. The house dressing was a shallot oil dressing, which tied the salad together.Then our steaks arrived. At fist glance they had a decent sear and felt medium rare to touch. The first piece I cut was slightly fatty, despite being a lean piece of meat. The meat was cooked appropriately, however it lacked seasoning. The meat was a little mealy and gritty. Very disappointed.The atmosphere wasn't of a high end steakhouse, it had more of a local bar feel. Which, for the price, was unfortunate. Perhaps I missed the good steak on the menu, but I think if you can't cook a fillet well, you can't cook.  Save your money and go to Capital Grille, American Cut Steakhouse or Morton's a short walk away.",0,0,0,Fred M.,"West View, Pittsburgh, PA",0,5,1

4.0,9/22/2017,"Came here for an early dinner for my sister's birthday. It wasn't crowded since it was a bit early for dinner and we had a reservation, so we were seated right away. The waiter served us water, bread and butter. I liked how there were a variety of bread options. They were a bit too chewy for my liking. I would have to say that service was phenomenal, maybe because there weren't too many customers. As for appetizer, we ordered baked clams which comes in a total of eight. There was an option to choose bacon or bread crumbs on top, and of course we went for the bacon. For entrees, we had the porterhouse steak for two and a lobster ravioli with a lobster sauce base (they have two options), it was recommended by our waiter. Everything came out in an orderly manner and the waiters were great. One waiter will serve us food and the other will fill our glass. We really enjoyed the baked clams. It comes with a generous amount of bacon crumbs on top. The dish looks super oily because of the combination of butter and red chili. It did not taste oily and in fact it was very delicious. The porterhouse steak and lobster ravioli came out the same time. We asked for a medium and it came out medium. The steak was very tender and some pieces were more well done. The middle part was the best. Seasoning was very light. It was good but I don't think it's anything too special. The lobster ravioli was mediocre. Presentation was great. The ravioli itself was a bit dense, can't really taste the lobster but the wrap was interesting. It came with black stripes on the ravioli. It was topped with a lobster tail, the meat was very tender. This dish also contain spinach... with a lot of garlic. The best part of this whole experience was how the waiters surprised my sister with their homemade Apple Strudel pastry. It was warm, fluffy and topped with ice-cream. It was really sweet of them and even caught me by surprise. The restaurant has a very nice interior. Although the food was more on the mediocre level, everything was great and we were both very satisfied with the service.

It was nothing special but nothing particularly to complain about- could've probably used some more croutons but that's just personal preference. For the main course I had the Cajun swordfish. Only one way to describe it- BLAND! It came with some mango salsa    which wasn't all that bad. But just coz the fish is topped off with the salsa does not mean you do not season the fish. No kidding- they didn't even add salt. Absolutely inedible. Now if the argument is that you get steak at a steakhouse, my response is: don't offer anything else on the menu other than steaks if you can't cook it well. And now the deserts. Was seriously hoping this would save the day but NO! I got the brownie and god only knows how many days ago it was baked but when it came to me it was hard as a rock. Having the sweet tooth that I have, I took a bite off my friend's cheesecake and it was disgusting. Not the least bit creamy- didn't even feel like a cheesecake.

It comes slightly warm, which is the way I like it.The steaks are always perfectly medium rare (actually they seem to come rare to medium rare). The sides are always good with the exception of the french fries.  I should have sent them back.  They just did not have a fresh taste to them.  This happened once before and they came out with some great fries when I asked.I usually have desserts, but we were all so full as ordered so many sides (do not miss the excellent grilled asparagus). In the past my biggest complaint was the perfunctory service. This time we had a wonderful waiter.  She was very helpful and wanted to make everything just right.  If all of the waitstaff were like her, it would be great.Do not miss taking a tour of the old J.P.

In hindsight we should have just paid full price at pretty much any other restaurant with a steak on the menu. Pretty much everything here has some type of issue and took a long time to come out. My steak was first brought out bloody when I asked for medium rare, when I sent it back it came back to me rare and I just relented and dealt with it, it ended up being one of the most lackluster, and certainly the fattiest, filets I've ever encountered. Also, my side order of fries turned into four or five ice cold ones on the plate with the steak, which I guess was an innocent enough misunderstanding but no effort whatsoever was made to correct.The dessert was also quite poor, the bread pudding tasted like white bread (and was worse than pound and pence's, a mid tier bar up the street), and the cheesecake was egregiously burnt.Honestly if we were paying full price I probably would have sent the steak and dessert back.Our waitress did a good job and was very attentive but seemed hamstrung by an error ridden kitchen.Also, my wife had quite a few glasses of wine and got pretty buzzed, so that was nice",1,1,0,Josh C.,"Manhattan, NY",124,16,2

I used a groupon and like others stated , there was no fuss in using it or a subpar Groupon menu that other restaurants reduce patrons to. I ordered a shrimp Caesar salad which was kind of dry even though dressing was on it and it only came with 3 pcs of shrimp. For some reason the servers took extra long in bringing out the other dishes we had ordered. By the time the other food came out I already got full from the lettuce I complained about that was dry lol and from the complimentary bread on the table. I ate some of my French fries (which were heavenly by the way) and a bite of my spicy chicken wrap which was good too before asking it to go.

2.0,2/10/2017,"This was an all around mediocre meal. Went for restaurant week for lunch. First thing is if you want steak (as opposed to, say, rigatoni with sausage) that'll be an extra $10. Oh, you want buffalo chicken  bites as an appetizer instead of salad (yes, the same ones you can get at any dive bar)? That'll be a $5 supplement. So now we're up to $44 for lunch. Doesn't sound like the best deal, right?So how was the steak?? Meh. For a filet mignon, I had to do a heck of a lot of surgery to trim away the fat and gristle. If I wanted a rib-eye, I would have ordered that. Flavor was okay, nothing special. 6 people at lunch and the most often uttered phrase was ""can you pass me back the salt?""How about the service. Again, meh. Waiter recommended a bottle of wine what tasted like something I'd pick up for $8 at the local store. Only they charged $60. Worse, ordered bacon as a supplement to the price fixe. Never came. When I gently reminded the waiter that we never received the bacon and didn't want to be charged for it, he said nothing. Not a thing. No apology. No offer to bring it on the house at that point. Nothing. Lots of better options for steak in NYC. Like Mark Joseph's. They too have a restaurant week deal that has one steak option included and another with only a $5 supplement.  Plus the food, service, and wine selection are much better.

We ordered the bacon appetizer and Caesar salad to start. Then we order the porterhouse for 2 as well as a gluttonous amount of sides. We got mashed potatoes, corn, Mac and cheese, and onion rings.Some of the things are overshadowed by the steak but the mashed potatoes and bacon were probably the second best part of the meal.

Although we'd never eaten at this location, we had only heard good things about their other locations, so decided to check out the steakhouse with my in-laws. We started by inquiring with BV's events team, and were swiftly introduced to Kelly. As a bride, Kelly is everything you could hope and dream for in an event planner. She answered all emails promptly, always provided the most detail possible, and overall, has a fantastic demeanor about herself that makes you want to book the space simply because she is so good at her job. We worked with Kelly on everything - and I mean, everything. From the menus, to the pricing, to the request to have the BV team move our rehearsal dinner flowers to our wedding venue that same night, Kelly and her staff were with us every step of the way to make the night perfect. And, don't get me started on the actual MEAL. My husband is still drooling over the Chilean Sea Bass, and all I can think about as I write this review  are all of the desserts that we consumed that night!

Everyone was nice but just didn't get the love one gets when dining in a NYC steakhouse. But it's the food that didn't slay me. To start, the Caesar sucked. A staple and you can't execute. Huge but no flavor whatsoever. No anchovy (ordered with but didn't help) garlic lemon. No flavor and the parm on top must be subpar because there was no taste of it. Steaks were just okay. No seasoning on outside. Filet was perfect but sirloin not as great a cut and a tad over cooked. Bernaise was stone cold, not room temp.  Spinach needed garlic and salt. Nothing was seasoned well   Won't go in to more details, never used so much salt in a resto unless it was for fries. No rose by the glass.

Almost every time we eat there we buy a Groupon but unlike some other places there does not seem to be a difference on how the wait staff treats us. Love their oversized Caesar's Salad, their crab cakes and baked clams as appetizers. While we love their steaks and Sea bass, my girlfriend has been on a lobster kick lately. So lately she has been ordering their massive and delicious 3lb lobster. Let me say, she is never disappointed and they even de-shell it for her too. The sides are also very good with the grilled asparagus and mashed potatoes being our favorites. Drinks are generously sized and have a nice bite to them.So what's the downside you ask? Not anything that we can see thus far. The wait staff are warm and attentive and the manager is a really great guy. He makes it a point to come over and chat with us each time we have been there. He even took us downstairs to the ""vault"" one Saturday evening so that we can consider it if we decide to throw a large party there. All in all, this is one of those places where you feel good going to. Nobody judges what you are wearing, they just want to make your experience there comfortable and a happy one.

We came as a party of 4 and ordered a porterhouse for 3, 2 appetizers, and 2 sides. For the starters, we agreed on the fried calamari and mussels. The 2 sides we ordered was the baked potato and fries. To pair with good company and steak, we also ordered a Malbec '11 from Italy. This wine was abosolutely a great pair. Ok so back to reviewing the food. I really enjoyed the appetizers more than the steak. The mussels tasted savory and tasted fresh. The calamari was had a very nice yogurt dip that went so well together. As for the steak, I'd say it was a bit bland. We ordered medium rare, however, it tasted a bit overcooked leaning towards medium. The steak sauce was very similar to Peter Luger's steak sauce which tasted very similar to cocktail sauce. The fries were average and the baked potato was plain as any potato with a side of sour cream.

Unfortunately, due to a negative recent experience, that has ended.About two weeks ago, a prestige Wall St firm has invited my company out for dinner symbolizing our newly developed partnership. Our firm dines with wholesalers frequently, about once every other week. Bobby Vans has been our go to spot.About 2 weeks ago, I ordered a medium rare Rib eye and they served me medium well. I asked if they can correct it and they did. No biggie. I noticed the waiter yelling at his server who took my order, then the server came up to ask me what was wrong with my steak. I said I sent it back because it was over cooked and the server quickly replied, ""you said you wanted it WELL DONE"" and walked away. This was unprofessional, unnecessary and embarrassing. I called the general manager, Kelly, the next day to inform her about this unpredictable incident and she thanked me for the feedback. She offered to send my office snacks. I respectfully declined because everyone had already left for the day. Kelly then offered I come in for a meal on the house, and was all for it! Asked if I can bring a coworker and she said she would love to ""accommodate"" a couple of us.       The next day I came in with a coworker, the host was expecting me and sat us, took our order, and had some drinks. Soon enough, Kelly comes up to us and expresses her apology and gives us a $100 gift certificate. Wow, how classy!After eating, we got the bill of $255. Yikes!I told the waiter that the manager was covering it. Soon enough, the floor manager comes to us and says that Kelly has left for the day and doesn't know about a free meal.

Classic steakhouse decor with the standard wood and wine glasses everywhere. Service was great, we were seated right away. The drink came in about 5 minutes and the appetizers came all together and fairly quickly in less than 10 minutes. Margarita on the rocks was amazing, perfect balance, not too strong or too sour.The caesar at salad was perfectly dressed, it was quite a large plate so well worth it for the price. The skillet mussels were also a big portion, it was enough for 2 people, and for only $15. It also came with garlic bread to dip. The jumbo lump crab cocktail wasn't as tender as I expected, probably the least favorite of all the appetizers but it was good with the sauce. We ordered the porterhouse for 2 and god it was huge. The steak side was perfectly cooked, but I found the filet mignon a bit too dry for my tasted. It needed a bit salt and pepper but good none the less. The steak also doesn't come with sides likeMost steakhouses do, so you do have to order it separately (we ordered the creamed spinach for $10).

Still trying to stay positive and not ruin our v day dinner, we were asked ""what do you want to order"" as our drinks were being placed. I hope whoever is reading this can also understand how horrible and disgusting service this is being in a famed very expensive steakhouse. Our apps came, food was delicious. Soon as our plates were lifted, dinner was served, horrible timing. Main dishes were delicious, sides were delicious. Our hash browns were burnt to a crisp, when this was addressed, we were told this is the chefs way of cooking it... Burnt hash browns.. Really? Dessert was a nightmare.. All they had was creme brulle and ice cream. We aren't children so we ordered creme bruelle. Came out ice cold. When we told the server, a pathetic server, looked at us like we were Morons. He took it back, returned moments later and said they had no more and offered us ice cream again. Our bill was 297. I would never come again. Service was horrible and disgusting.

1.0,1/23/2016,"My friend and I came here on a Friday night for NYC Restaurant Week. Our first clue that things weren't going to go so well was the fact that the restaurant was fairly empty for 7:15pm on a Friday. For appetizers, there was a choice between two types of salads and the soup of the day. The waitress told us that the soup of the day was cream of broccoli, so I decided to go with that. When the waitress brought out our appetizers, she placed a bowl of soup in front of me and said, ""We switched it out with vegetable soup, is that ok?"" Well, seeing as how she had already put it in front of me, it felt weird to have said no. She should have asked me if I still wanted to have the soup before bringing it out, because I would have said no then.Service was surprisingly slow, especially since the restaurant was not even remotely close to being crowded. There were still a lot of empty tables, so I find it unacceptable to have to wait 45 minutes for our entrees to come out. I had ordered the scallops, which was slightly overcooked and extremely greasy. After eating that, it felt like I just had a film of grease down my throat, and it wasn't pleasant. The servers also got our orders wrong for dessert too, but at that point, we weren't surprised. I don't know if it was because we were ordering off the Restaurant Week menu or if the waitress was just having a bad day, but overall, it was a disappointing experience and I will not be coming back.

3.0,1/22/2016,"A-OK. Not my first choice when it comes to steakhouses, but they do a decent job. I recently came to this location for a team dinner. There were 10 of us, and the host told us we were going to be seated downstairs in the vault area, which required us to go back outside. Odd. Also, for some reason, the door was locked when we tried to go downstairs and it took a bit of knocking for someone to come in and open the door. A strange start, but then we were quickly seated. The vault inside is actually kinda cool, although it seemed like the vault doors were incredibly dated, and hadn't been polished in a while.We all went with the restaurant week menu, which we actually had not previously researched, so it was a pretty nice find. $38 for a 3-course menu, which actually included filet mignon without a supplement! I personally went with the Caesar salad, the filet mignon, and the chocolate mousse tart. Caesar salad was well-dressed, and the steak was cooked to a nice medium rare, with a bit of char on the outside. The accompanying french fries were sort of soggy, but the creamed spinach was pretty good. The chocolate mousse tart was excellent, probably the highlight of the meal. Most everyone in the party really liked their steak, although the lone person who ordered the sea scallops was a bit disappointed. She mentioned that the scallops were seared pretty well and had good texture, but was just way too greasy for her tastes.Service was on the slower side, but still relatively attentive. Prices for restaurant week were obviously quite nice, but I took a glimpse at the regular menu prices, and I'm just not sure I would go to Bobby Van's over the other steakhouses in the area at $50+ per steak.Overall, a fairly solid experience, with some blips here and there. Bobby Van's is definitely worth a look during restaurant week (month), but if you're going to pay (or expense) a lot for steak, go to Wolfgang's or Delmonico's if you're in Tribeca/FiDi.",38,22,38,Eric J.,"New York, NY",490,923,1792

It started with checking in and being meeting by the manager Kenny, more on him in a bit. We were early, a rarity in my house hold and grabbed a drink at the bar, one of the best dirty martini's I've ever had kudos to the bar. Kenny then seated us early in one of the best seats in the house. Pierce of server was as attentive as they come. I never had an empty glass of water or wine, I drink fast so this so empty glasses are common. Pierce also learned about our specific taste in wine and instead of recommending a bottle offered glasses which not only fit our individuality but complimented the meals we ordered.

NYC steakhouse prices are always outrageous, but sometimes you have to do what you have to do. I love a good steak, as does he.We started with La Crema Pinot Noir, bluepoint oysters and Oysters Rockefeller. Probably the best Oysters Rockefeller I've ever had. For the entree I ordered a petite sirloin (rare), he ordered a rib eye (rare), and we ordered the green beans & the mashed potatoes as our sides. The green beans were excellent, definitely not overdone and nicely seasoned. The steaks were out of this world. We both brought home half, and his dog Abby was very happy to receive the bone. We were way too full to have dessert and opted for coffee, the only disappointment of the evening. My buddy even remarked that he's always found that steakhouses have meh coffee.Service was excellent. We were treated like royalty, which isn't always the case when using a groupon. The place was extremely busy and had a couple of Christmas parties going on. It got loud in there and the goombahs and their tomatoes at the next table were a riot. I wish I'd recorded their conversation, it made for some hilarious entertainment.Last year we went to a different steak house for his birthday. While I liked it, this was better. It was a gorgeous night, who would have thought that Dec. 15th would have been so warm?

5.0,10/5/2015,"October 3rd happened to be both the day of a very big standardized test I was taking and the 6 month half-anniversary with my girlfriend, so what better way to celebrate than to have a huge steak dinner? I bought a groupon couple of weeks ago for a $120 for $200 off you check deal (with the 30% off of local deals promotion, I got it at a steal!). I had always heard of the name Bobby Van's alongside of Luger's, Wolfgang's, and the like, so this was a perfect chance to try them out. The Groupon was for the Financial District location, which was honestly super exciting for me since I knew that that one was the one that had the huge vault inside.We had set a reservation for 8PM, but wanted to eat earlier so we called and they were happy to oblige. When we arrived, the hostess took our coats and we were seated in the dining area. Unfortunately, for dinners, they close the basement level of the restaurant (where the vault is located). We started off with the crab cake and the tuna tartare. The Tuna was pretty average, and I don't mean it in a bad way - just not super memorable. I enjoyed the avocados and the acidity of the sauce, but I wouldn't rave about it. The crab cake on the other hand, was a home run. My gf absolutely loved it, as did I. The meat, while there were some shell pieces in it, was delicious and balanced perfectly with the ""cake."" She said it would rank in the top 3 of her favorite crabcakes. We ordered a half bottle of red wine ($55) to go with the two Bone-In Ribeyes that we ordered (medium rare of course).These steaks were HUGE. If you are NOT hungry, you will NOT finish (okay, I wasn't famished, but I still finished mine... then again I am a 6'2"" 180lb dude so...). I would guess that each one weighed close to 2 pounds (definitely over 1.5 lbs). But better than the quantity was the perfect quality of the meat. I have tried a couple of steakhouses (Luger, Wolfgang, The Strip, Hillstone), but this was BY FAR the juiciest and savory cut I have had in New York (is pretty much on par with my favorite steakhouse, Fleming's, in California). The meat was marbled with a lot of fat, which is a detriment to some but a boon for me. I wish I had the stomach to eat several of these, but alas the human body can only do so much. I would highly recommend this steak on your visit here.To top of the evening, our waiter Shakeel took us down into the basement level to see the vault (yay!). He gave a us a short tour of the kitchen and explained a bit of the history of the franchise and location. It was really cool to see all of the vault doors and even get the chance to open a ""personal safe"" located in the back. The massive J.P.Morgan vault door is a whopping 8 TONS. I hope it never falls off its hinges because that would crush you like a bug. He took a couple great photos of us in the doorway that came out perfectly.Saturday nights are half-off for wines, so if you want to impress your date and have a great time, bring him/her here!",4,1,4,Justin Y.,"Washington, DC",801,355,90

3.0,9/8/2015,"Veal Chop was amazing, though most of the portion was bone and fat and gristle, very little meat was to be found, maybe five medallions total, but the flavor was remarkable, cooked a beautiful medium rare, we couldn't stop oohing and ahh-ing, and although it was really delicious, it definitely wasn't enough bang for far too many bucks! As for the bone-in Ribeye (my favorite cut of steak), it was underwhelming, and similarly overwhelmed with fat and gristle and bones, but there really wasn't much flavor, yet it was still pretty expensive, unfairly so. And so was the Filet Mignon, desperately lacking in flavor, and anything but affordable, although thankfully this was entirely edible and easily rendered the most meat per dollar, albeit bland and unmemorable, so I wouldn't even bother ordering it again. The reason our evening was still favorable--including the aforementioned Veal Chops--were the Lamb Chops, which were beautifully tender and juicy and delicious, the only meat dish that I thought was actually worth the price, since you get five wonderful pieces. Also, the onion rings were really good, yet I wish they used a little more batter to fully cover the sweet crunchy onions, so they would be easier to pick up, and they wouldn't fall apart as much, and they wouldn't get as cold so quickly, but the portion was large, and we loved them. But the Macaroni and Cheese was kind of a disaster, no flavor of cheese, the sauce was broken and watery and lumpy, the only detectable flavor was garlic, and it was severely lacking in any seasoning whatsoever, plus the waitress who kept insisting on serving it to us, rather than letting us serve ourselves, kept dropping noodles and sauce everywhere! The breads were all delicious, the wines and cocktails were generous, the service was friendly and attentive, but, overall, I can't see myself returning or recommending Bobby Van's on Broad Street.

We each had ONE drink. Our bill came to ****$180**** not including tip, which is insane given how subpar the food was. If the food had been great, this review would never be happening.Food notes:- The buffalo chicken tasted good in flavor, but was served chinese food style? As in, cut up into tiny, little pieces - smaller than bite size - and served in a condiment dish. I would have expected to get this at TGIFridays, not BVs. - Caesar salad: this might have come from a local sandwich shop like Pret - it was super unflavorful and completely overdressed. Definitely not the legit caesar dressing you would get at most good restaurants.- The slab bacon was so fucking overcooked that I genuinely was convinced it was microwaved leftovers from yesterday and I could barely cut through it with my knife. Don't even bother getting this, huge waste. This does not come close to comparing to what you'd get at Peter Lugers, which is sadly what I was hoping for.- Sauteed spinach and mushrooms sides: completely non-memorable. My fiancee asked if he could sub the less healthy sides that were included in his restaurant week order (mashed potatoes; pathetically bad onion rings) and they would not. So, we paid and extra / wasted $22, definitely not worth it.- Cheesecake - this definitely was a bummer of a dessert. It was gelatinous, which is very odd.- Martini: Had one, NOT top shelf (Tito's vodka). TWENTY DOLLARS. Not rounding up from $17 or $18. Most expensive martini I remember having, even being a longtime NYer and committed martini drinker.Other note: there were MULTIPLE flies / gnats flying around our table. Which we pointed out to the waitress. She apologized but obviously not much could be done.Silver lining: the bread was good!Overall, definitely will not go back. And very bummed to say that because I'd been looking forward to the experience. If you're looking for a legit steak spot in the neighborhood but toned down to grill-style atmosphere, definitely go to Del Monico's Grill. Been there and it's great, only positive things to say.",1,1,0,Jamie C.,"New York, NY",3,7,0

3.0,7/22/2015,"So we can here for restaurant week and here is the breakdown: Gazpacho: 3/5 the gazpacho wasn't that great. The flavor was fairly bland, without any interesting spice combination. The avocado seemed like it was just randomly placed in the bowl and was and to mix around. A friend had the French onion soup. I didn't try it but it had an INSANE amount of cheese. No one in their right mind should finish that soup - it was simply too rich. Steal: 3/5 I took into account three things: flavor, cooking, and temperature. The flavor was quite mediocre in the filet mignon - the butter and garlic spread did not come out at all and the sauce below the steak was left for nought. Cooking wise it reached the perfect color and was very juicy. Temperature was the worst by far. The steak was not hot!! It was semi warm but definitely cooling! This was the biggest disappointment. Chocolate mousse: 5/5 the chocolate mousse was great. It wasn't too sweet and was perfectly bitter. The texture was very soft and melted in your mouth. Finally, the crush was divine!!! Definitely recommended. Beware: other people had cheesecake - it was richer than the chocolate mousse.",0,0,0,Aditi V.,"Philadelphia, PA",360,12,0
2.0,7/21/2015,"Not impressed at all! The food was good but the service was lacking and downright questionable. And considering the prices I am expecting way more.Had reservations for Friday night at 9pm and even though it was relatively quiet, we still had to wait ten minutes for our table.  The more baffling part was that the table we were seated at was already set when we arrived!  I had a perfect view of it while waiting next to the hostess' booth.After being seated again waited for a waiter to even approach us.  The two gentleman in the table next to us seemed to be having the same problem trying to get attention from their waiter.They were out of both options that we wanted for desert but because of the time it was understandable.Lastly the nail that sealed the coffin for this place was when the waiter brought the bill, he circled the gratuity section.  I don't even expect this at Olive Garden let alone an upscale steak house. Why the assumption that we need to be told what the gratuity should be? especially since it's already printed on the receipt!  Tacky tacky tacky Will never return, old homestead is a much better choice!",0,1,0,L R.,"Staten Island, NY",1,41,11

With that said the sirloin steak I ordered from the Restaurant Week Menu left something to be desired.  I ordered my steak rare and it was still pretty tough to chew; it was under-seasoned as well.  On the plus side, the cabernet that I washed the steak down with was pretty smooth.  The chocolate mousse cake for dessert was pretty good.  It wasn't extraordinary, but it was pleasant.  Overall, I wasn't floored by my meal; I don't think I would necessarily recommend this restaurant.  I might give it one more try, perhaps one of the other locations and maybe try a different item on their menu just to make sure I'm not making a rash judgment.",0,0,0,Winsome C.,"Las Vegas, NV",113,16,0

I should have known from the first glance of fake candles and lack of customers to not have gone in. When we entered there was no host to greet us and we waited a good two minutes confused as to where to go. Finally, he came over and seated us in the back of the restaurant- the table RIGHT next to the opening/closing kitchen door. The restaurant was nearly empty so I thought it was a bit weird to put us there but we just went with it. The Restaurant Week menu was a joke because all of the steak items had surcharges. We came to a steak house to eat steak obviously and take advantage of trying a new place participating in Restaurant Week. We ended up paying the surcharges, ordering some drinks and an appetizer and our bill (with tip) was well over $130! NOT the bottom line you're expecting when you come for restaurant week... We wouldn't have cared about the bill being so high if the food and experience was better. The steak was okay but everything, and I mean everything else was terrible. The bernaise tasted like it had come from a package and was left out all day, the sides were greasy and unappealing. The food really didn't seem fresh at all. I'm not surprised to have read people got food poisoning here. As for the atmosphere, omg.... there was inappropriate music(90s songs R&B) playing, fake candles and no real charm to the space. When we asked the waiter if they could possibly change the music, he wasn't capable of doing this so brought the manager over. We asked him to please change the music and he gave a weird look and then went to change it to possibly worse/more inapropriate music- regae! Who plays regae at an ""upscale"" steakhouse?!Last and certainly not least, the service was absolutely terrible- like god awful, terrible.

3.0,8/14/2014,"My coworkers and I recently came here for lunch to wrap up Restaurant Week.  When we arrived, it took the hostess a few minutes to find our reservation but she finally did.  We were seated right near the downstairs entrance, which is right by a locked party room full of expensive bottles of wine.  The vault is also down on the lower level and is kind of cool to look at, considering this used to be a financial institution.For our appetizers, half the group went with the caesar salad and the other half (including myself) went with the mixed greens.  The dressing on both salads was very tasty but the ingredients themselves were a bit disappointing.  We were given the wine list but unfortunately their cheapest bottle of wine ran for around $50.  We ended up going with a Pinot Noir for $60 (definitely not worth the money) followed by a merlot for $50 (very heavy but better than the pinot).  For my entree, I got the scallops over arugula salad.  I should have listened to my coworker when he said I'd probably get four scallops.  He was right.  Four little scallops, grilled to perfection, surrounding a mound of salad.  The scallops were VERY tasty and left me wanting more.  The salad was so-so.  Also there were only two cherry tomatoes, sliced in half, on the plate.  The portion size was disappointing.  A few people in the group for the steak sandwich.  This looked much, much better.  It came on a nice hero with mushroom cream sauce.  They all said the steak was cooked to perfection.  The rest of the group went with the salmon and they said it was enjoyable, but definitely not the best.The real winner of the meal was the cheesecake.  It was definitely infused with coconut and was the perfect consistency.  One person decided to be different and go with the chocolate mousse cake, they said it was good but extremely heavy.  Service here was just okay and the manager we met seemed a bit abrupt.  It's also eerily quiet in here.  No background music, not much chatter.  If you weren't talking, all you would hear is silence.  The food could most definitely be improved upon but I suppose if you like spending a lot for mediocre food, then this is your place.",3,0,0,Kristy R.,"New York, NY",421,1576,174

My appetizer was the glazed bacon slab and it was delicious. My main course was the sirloin steak; it was tasty but too fatty. The sirloin also came with mashed potatoes and onion rings which were both excellent. The service was quite slow and the decor of the steakhouse on the first floor was quite bland.

3.0,8/1/2014,"A friend and I came here for lunch during Summer 2014 restaurant week . I ordered the caesar salad for course 1, filet mignon with creamed spinach a side of mashed potatoes for course 2, and their cheesecake for dessert.  Their caesar salad, mashed potatoes, and cheesecake were delicious (I'm definitely a fan of those menu items).  The service was good. The wait staff was very attentive and I didn't feel rushed.   The cutlery was clean (I didn't have to ask for a cup of hot water lol). The ambiance is decent.  I like the full bar up front. They have a great selection of wines but I'm not really into wine and they didn't have a cocktail menu for the seating area. I wasn't too pleased with the quality of their filet mignon, it was a bit tough to cut and to chew which is kind of disappointing for a steakhouse. The creamed spinach was a little slimy but it was edible when mixed with the mashed potatoes.  All in all, I give them 3.4 stars. This was my first Bobby Van's Steakhouse experience. Despite the mid star level rating I think they're worth giving another try. Perhaps I'll go for the rib eye steak next time with hopes that it doesn't turn out as bad as the filet mignon but I'll definitely be looking forward to the caesar salad and mashed potatoes.",1,0,0,Sunshine D.,"New York, NY",2,8,0

Our server Jesus was very knowledgable about the menu and was very friendly. The maître d' Kenny was kind enough to give us a tour of the Vault. A very cool experience.

4.0,7/22/2014,"RESTAURANT WEEK:Thanks E. for treating me to such a wonderful meal at Bobby Van's on my birthday.PRO:- SLICED STEAK SANDWICH with fries and fried onions - Mmm so delicious! I got it done medium and the steak was juicy and moist. The sauce in the sandwich really complimented the steak along with a crispy crunch of onions. This was good however it is very heavy. It was a little too much meat for me but nonetheless very good. The fries were very good as well.- TARTUFO - for an extra $2 the ice cream was great. I liked that it had a mix of chocolate and vanilla ice cream. Right in the middle there is a maraschino cherry however the best part was the hard crunchy chocolate outer layer (sorta like the ones you find on Häagen-Dazs' chocolate ice cream bars) with strawberry sauce on top.- Waiters were very attentive. They poured water as necessary and asked if we'd like salt and pepper in our dishes.- Good view/antique decor in the basement. You can see an old bank vault in here.THE OKAY:- MANHATTAN CLAM CHOWDER - loved the ingredients in the soup: tomatoes, potatoes, and clams. Taste wise it was ok.- GRILLED SEA SCALLOPS over arugula salad with miso dressing -- the scallops had just the right about of bounce and tenderness to it however there was burnt grilled taste to it. I think the scallops were a little lacking in flavor but the miso dressing for the salad helped the over all taste. CON:- CHOCOLATE MOUSSE CAKE - I tried a bit from E's plate and I found it too rich and creamy. I didn't really like it that much.Boy am I stuffed!

We were a party of 5 with my 1 year old.  I have to say, being a parent in NYC is difficult.  The trains have no elevators.  Cabs refuse to stop if they see you with a  stroller.  Restaurants (Mr. Chow's, I'm talking about YOU.) give you the stink-eye.Happily, Bobby Van's was a very pleasant surprise.  The Maitre 'D smiled at us and welcomed us.  Although this was a mostly business crowd on a Thursday night, they happily seated us at a table with plenty of space.  The portions were quite ample, especially for restaurant week, during which restaurants are notorious for cutting back on portion size.  I had the filet mignon which was cooked to perfection.  These guys definitely know their steaks.  We had 3 filet mignons, well-done, medium-well, and medium and we could immediately tell which was which.  Even the basic chicken-noodle soup appetizer was delightful, as my daughter will attest.The only possible negative was that I sensed the waiter wanted to clear the table while we were still feeding my daughter the appetizer.  All in all, a wonderful dinner.  We hope to visit again very soon.",2,1,0,Al F.,"New York, NY",0,25,0

4.0,2/17/2014,"Here's my review based on 2 different occasions of coming to Bobby Van's Grill over lunch.  The steakhouse is upstairs so I cannot comment on that dining experience.The first time I came here, I went with a coworker to escape our office for a catch up lunch.  We were warned that service could potentially be slow, so we anticipated that we would be there for a while.  Much to my surprise, our lunch was anything but slow.  The waitress was super helpful and brought our drinks quickly, took our orders quickly, and our food came out quickly.  I had the pepper-crusted tuna which was a special for that day, and it was grilled to perfection and a fantastic dish.  My coworker had the sirloin steak sandwich which she enjoyed as well.  Portions were huge, so I ended up taking half of it home with me for dinner.   The sautéed spinach and tomato garnish was flavorful and complimented the tuna well.  We didn't have to wait ages to get our check and were back in the office in a reasonable time frame.  Fast-forward to a few weeks later when I returned with a larger group of 12 for lunch.  Thankfully they were able to accommodate us at one large round table which was great and very much appreciated (huge thank you to the staff for that).We were promptly seated and drink orders were taken, but that was the only aspect of our meal that was prompt.  Perhaps the 15+ minute wait it took for us to receive our drinks (sodas, waters, and teas) should have been an indication of what's to come.  Eventually we were able to place our food orders, which took over an hour to arrive.  We spoke to the waitress and eventually the manager who indicated that they would not bring out  dishes until all were completed and the one burger was taking a longer time.  He did apologize for the delay and sure enough our dishes arrived shortly there after.This time I ordered the salmon and it didn't disappoint.  It was flavorful and the sauce and potatoes were a nice compliment to the fish.As an apology for the extreme delay in receiving our food, the manager did give our table desserts on the house.Both times service was great, although for larger groups I would choose another place unless you have 2+ hours to spend for lunch.",3,0,0,Anita A.,"Columbus, OH",36,173,32

I pointed it out to the staff and they put in an order for a new filet. The new steak took more time than I expected, and by the time it arrived, I had my fill from my fiance's plate and the other side dishes, so wasn't that hungry. I ate a portion of it and took the rest to go. Both our steaks were decent, but we've both had better from comparably priced places in the city.At the end of the night, we noticed that the staff had accidentally charged us for the extra filet mignon which was over-cooked.

2.0,8/13/2013,"I came in with a party of about 16 a few weeks ago for a birthday party during restaurant week.  Starting with the food: Off of the special menu, I ordered the soup of the day, which was French onion soup, prime sirloin steak (+$10), and the cheesecake.  The bread in the French onion soup was still slightly crispy and not soggy mush, which was a big plus.  Many of the other members of my party ordered the same steak and found theirs to be too tough, but I found mine to be just fine. The creamed spinach that came with the sirloin was also delicious.  While I don't usually use steak sauce, I decided to give their signature sauce a try and couldn't stop eating it.  The cheesecake, while not the best I've ever had, was decent.Now for the service:  The first thing that I noticed was the beer selection not printed anywhere for us to choose from.  When I asked one of the two waiters what was available, he simply said, ""what do you want?"" to which I replied, ""what do you have?""  He listed a few types of beers, like lager, light beer, IPA, etc. and when I asked what IPA was available, he didn't know.  Not a big deal.  The rest of our meal, however, was a problem.  Empty glasses over the table that were not picked up.  Drink orders taken from individuals that called the waiter over while other members trying to get the waiter's attention were ignored.  Appetizer dishes left on the table that were not picked up.  A simple two scoops of gelato that took a good 15 minutes to arrive after everyone at the table had gotten their dessert.  Someone at the end of the table ordered a coffee to a food runner unbeknownst to the rest of the table while desserts were being passed out, yet no one was offered coffee.  A few of the party members wanted to order coffee, but the waiter never came by to check on us.

While it was good, I've had similar tasting steaks at restaurants far cheaper and more casual than Bobby Van's.Luckily though, I came to Bobby Van's with some co-workers during Restaurant Week. For just $35, I was able to get a steakhouse wedge salad, a filet mignon with fries and creamed spinach, and a cheesecake dessert.While the food here is quite satisfying, very little distinguishes these dishes from the kind you can find at any other steakhouse in America. The only dish I was actually really intrigued by was the steakhouse wedge salad. Artistically presented, the square wedge salad came with generous helpings of bacon, fried onions, and blue cheese dressing on top. Best wedge salad I've ever had. Not sure I would consider it a healthy food choice though...haha.The service here is professional, but not incredibly attentive. I had to personally get the server's attention to get refills on my drinks, and she completely ignored the way we wanted the check split.Atmosphere-wise, this is considered an up-scale steakhouse, so I wouldn't feel super comfortable wearing just a t-shirt and shorts here.

2.0,7/30/2013,"First of all, it was freezing. I felt like I should have worn my fur coat. Secondly, I tried to explain to the waitress I wanted a small filet mignon by itself, as well as the scallops by themselves (no sides, just the filet and scallops) and that I wanted to order the sides separately. She didn't understand so after trying to explain myself three times, I gave up and just ordered the scallops because I wanted to leave because of the air conditioning. I had the crab cake as my appetizer. It was a 7 out of 10. The scallops were on top of a huge amount of mashed potatoes and were fresh, but another 7 out of 10 rating. My boyfriend had the tuna tartar as his appetizer. It was a 5/6 1/2. As his entrée he had a bone in ribeye medium rare. More like medium. A 4 1/2. My mom cooks better. It's a steakhouse so... Really? We also had the creamed spinach as a side. A 6. It wasn't cheesy, but it wasn't bad. And we got the hash browns which were probably the best thing we ordered. 7 1/2. The service, especially considering our waitress (long black hair with bangs, and foreign, using a description because I didn't get her name) had only maybe three tables in the beginning and at the end only ours, was fake friendly. That's fine, but friendly isn't enough. After the food came she only asked once if we were ok. Then she disappeared and after waiting 20 MINUTES for her to come back, I finally had to get up myself to let her know we were done. After a couple minutes (guess she finished the conversation she had with her friends) she came over and gave us the check. I already had my card in my hand. We are you last table, don't you want to go home? Are you trying to make your tip dwindle with every passing minute? 10 minutes later (I had been literally shaking for maybe a half hour from the cold, and she knew) we flagged down a bus boy to let him know we were more than ready to leave. She comes over, five minutes go by, and then she comes over with the bill. SERIOUSLY?! Horrible service, mediocre food... especially since I was expecting it to be very good. A very annoying and unpleasant experience. I live in the same building above the steakhouse and I won't be getting food from there ever again.",3,1,0,Martina D.,"Manhattan, NY",524,231,440

My Filet Mignon came butterflied because I wanted it well done, and it was delicious... Juicy, full of flavor, tender! The creamed spinach was too creamy for me and had a sort of strange taste to it. The fries were decent. Even though I normally prefer skinny fries, I liked the crispness and flavor of these ones. Dessert was the tartufo and really delightful- Not too sweet and all the flavors of the ice creams/chocolate shell and cherry combined really well together.

1.0,7/21/2013,"i was not expecting much due to a disappointing dinner at the bobby vans in bridgehampton. But  we had a groupon coupon for 200, and my date assured me the bobby vans steak house would be different and better. Sadly, it was not a great experience.  Upon entry, there is a portable ac unit sloppily hooked up to cool the restaurant. With the extreme heat wave nyc was having, we never cooled off enough to relax. Their AC was not working properly. They sat us in the back, I'm assuming in the groupon section. The table setting was incomplete- I only had one bent salad fork. Now on to the food. The escargot was completely overpowered by too much oregano. You would think it'd be fairly simple to make a good garlic butter... The clams were overstuffed with too much bread crumbs and was slightly bland. Our ceasar salad was  warm. Even the plate was hot. The waiter feigned surprise, but he should have noticed the hot salad plate. They made us a new salad but forgot to put any dressing on. Obviously not a real caesar salad. No taste of anchovy for starters. I've had better ""instant"" caesar salads at cheap diners.As for the steak, the waiter went into a long explanation of how they could only make Medium or Medium Rare, nothing in between. Our steaks arrived more on the rare side, and extremely charred to the bone, even though we did not order it charred grilled. The quality of the meat was good, but when you charge 44.00 for a steak, you expect it to be cooked properly. The waiter explained that they tend to undercook as you can always send it back to cook a little longer. They didn't want to chance overcooking and then wasting the steak. Capital Grill has much better steaks and know how to cook it properly! Plus their AC works. We ordered the tiramisu for desert. Tasted store bought and the lady fingers were not soaked in coffee or anything. Nothing special, even though I ate it all (sweet tooth).Overall, the waiter was very pleasant. I assume he does very well in tips, as he suggested leaving 20%. I normally leave more, but we did as he suggested. Groupon or not, I think we will go to Capital Grill the next time we want a good steak. Plus their AC actually works.",2,1,0,Danny S.,"Manhattan, NY",2,4,1
4.0,7/18/2013,"I went to Bobby Van's Steakhouse with my fiance to celebrate our anniversary (this was about a month ago but I am finally writing this review). We just moved into the area and wanted a place we could walk to. Plus, we starting heading out at 9 PM so it was kind of a late dinner. We also wanted spoil ourselves a bit. I stumbled upon this place on Yelp and saw pretty decent reviews. The pictures of the food and interior also helped draw us in. Service: The server was very friendly but definitely trained in sales. They had a drink special that night; every bottle was half priced. He continued to push this special and because it was our anniversary we decided to get two bottles. One was a red for my fiance and the other a Champagne for me. I mentioned I liked anything sweet so they gave me raspberry cordial to add. I thought it was a very nice gesture and I was pleasantly surprised with the taste of the champagne. The staff were very accommodating and attentive. Atmosphere: Brightly lit but still intimate and romantic. They have this massive vault door leading to another dining area, very neat! It was quiet when we were there but we had a late dinner.The appetizer: Baked clams. I have recently taken a liking to baked clam and I have had it three times prior to this dinner. This was by far the best I've had. Mains: I had the sauteed sea scallop dish. I generally love scallops, it's probably my favorite seafood choice. However, I wasn't a huge fan of this. It tasted a bit chewy, probably a bit over cooked and not that fresh. We've recently moved from Australia where seafood is incredibly fresh so maybe I have high standards?My fiance had the Gorgonzola Steak and he loved it. It was cooked to perfection and just as he had requested - medium rare. So far, one of his favorite places for steak. Dessert: We were so stuffed at the end. I didn't think I had room for any dessert. However, before the server even asked us if we wanted a dessert menu, he brought us a chocolate mousse cake with a candle on it! It was a complimentary dessert. I mentioned that it was our anniversary in the very beginning and I didn't think the server would really take note of this but to our surprise he definitely did. I was one happy girl and even though I was stuffed I just couldn't say no to this amazing and free chocolate cake! I mean c'mon I am female after all...Overall, I had a positive experience. Service was great, just a little pushy. Atmosphere was lovely, such a great place for a date or anniversary. The food was good, the only thing I didn't care for so much was my main. But then again, scallops are my favorite and maybe I have really high standards. Dessert was such a nice gesture!

2.0,7/16/2013,"We got the chocolate mousse cake and the carrot cake to go. When we tried to eat it, we realized the chocolate mousse cake was molded. Yes molded. As in it had 2 spots of green mold growing on it. We promptly called the restaurant back and told them what happened. They suggested giving us a refund for the cake. Great, but we actually wanted cake. So we went back in to the restaurant and they gave us a fresh piece of the chocolate mousse cake in exchange for the molded chocolate mousse cake and threw in a complimentary slice of cheesecake.Now, a few things. First, this is Bobby Van's. I am shocked they would actually give someone a piece of molded cake. I know they don't make it themselves, but this didn't taste molded - it was molded. It had mold on the cake. Two spots of green mold. We took it back and showed them, so there was no denying the fact it had mold.Second, it's weird we had to go back to exchange it. I think they should have offered to have it delivered (we live in the area).Anyway, I'm pretty sure the ""fresh"" chocolate mousse cake came from the same cake even though it was supposed to come from a different one because it tasted so sour and on the verge of expiration. Not good.The cheesecake was light and ok, but there is some terrible, inedible taste in the crust.

The lobster cocktail was very good and cooked nicely. We ordered the porterhouse med rare but it was still a bit on the medium side for me. The steak had an ok char on it but didn't really melt in my mouth like Peter Lugers or Mark Joseph. It was a bit dry in some parts. The steak sauce was good. More on the ketchup side and with less horse radish. Without the groupon I definitely don't feel it was worth it but with with groupon it's was an okay deal if you are limited to the area. The service was good and the ambience is nice for the financial district.   I gave 3 stars based on the non-groupon price. 3.5 for the groupon price.,0,1,1,Vincent N.,"Brooklyn, NY",154,121,2092

I had dropped in earlier in the week to setup my reservation, I was a little nervous because I wasn't sure how well they would be with passing on the word that I wanted a bottle of wine chilled and ready to serve. Upon getting that setup, the concierge also told me about a great Groupon deal they were having, which saved me some extra cash for an extra bottle to go. When I showed up that Friday evening, everything was ready to go, I was very pleased to see the bottle table side. My date was running rather late, but as I waited, the waiters/waitresses continued to check in on me, they never let me glass hit empty.  For a Friday the noise level wasn't bad, everyone was so kind and courteous, when it came to the bill, because of the groupon deal I still had quite a few left to spend, so the waitress listed some options and I settled for a bottle of wine to enjoy later that evening. The service overall was phenomenal, the food was cooked just the way I asked, me and my date both went with the fillet Mignon butterfly cut cooked to a medium, with asparagus and their calamari.

Hence the 2 stars, because the first time it was a success. So I decided to go back and order a second time.Second time I ordered the lamb (at around 5ish so slightly early dinner) it came BURNT, and medium, not pink in the middle like medium rare, I don't even care if it isn't medium rare but it was DAMNED BURNT. Is the chef lazy before the chef during dinnertime at 8 or something? Freaking annoyed because i spent $75 on the stupid lamb and oysters rockefeller. The Oysters were not great, let me tell you... it tasted bad...But i still can not get over the BURNT LAMB. BURNT MEDIUM RARE LAMB. Trust me you don't like tasting burnt to the bone meat. Not yummy, it tastes like gasoline and worse. I am angry because I paid over $75 for this. Never again. You lost a very good customer. I live  and work around the corner and I love lamb, so I would've ordered this again (which I did, because this is the second time) But the second time was so bad. It was so burnt, I lost my appetite. I am so disappointed. Telling my co workers around the area about this, not a place for lunch or dinner meetings.

2.0,3/27/2013,"Overall I was disappointed. My group started at the bar with a bone-in lamb appetizer. The lamb was cooked to perfection, full of natural flavor and fell off the bone. I highly recommend it for large groups! Tomato and mozzarella salad: This is such a simple dish and should be kept that way. I received a plate of unripe tomatoes covered with a cold scoop of semi-caramelized onions and oily roasted red peppers. All I know is 2 bites were enough to push the plate away. Lacking in flavor and freshness.Beef Wellington: Oh boy was this a sad dish. The beef was undercooked and not as tender as the shared steak my table ordered (a beautiful medium pink). If the filling contained liver pate, I couldn't taste it. In fact, I could hardly taste the filling at all. The pastry was dense and missing that butter flavor and flakiness that make this dish spectacular. Nothing melted in my mouth and I was envious of the table steak my friends were eating.Side Dishes: Cream of spinach and mushrooms both required additional spicing. The potato hash was moist and perfectly spiced; I would recommend this if you order a side.Desert and coffee: What the hell!?!? I absolutely hate when a restaurant has their deserts delivered unless it's from a top notch bakery. We ordered a shared desert platter - 6 different slices of cake that the corner deli must have walked over. I was just shocked when I saw that standard stiff puff of cream on the top end of the cheesecake which had clearly been flattened by its container.

After working long hours and only seeing the walls of hotel rooms and such for days/weeks at a time, nothing pleases me more than eating something other than the room service menu. This place was within walking distance from the hotel in the financial district. That was a plus. We were exhausted and ready to get back home to somewhat normal lives that we would have rather be someplace close. We were greeted by everyone: bartender, hostess, and a couple of servers, one being ours (name I cannot remember). Right then, I knew we were in good hands and had chosen a great place to end our work stint in New York. I went with the special: oscar filet, topped with sauteed spinach and crab meat and a Hollandaise sauce. It came with choice of a soup or salad, so I ordered the warm spinach salad (bacon, goat cheese). I could have had this as a dish too since it was so light and delicious. There was no way. I was looking forward to my filet which was oh so heavenly. I'm probably exaggerating but after eating almost everything off the hotel menu (have I mentioned this enough?), this was my treat. I thought I had eaten my way into a food coma, but then we ordered a few desserts to share. Oh lord. Our server recommended the carrot cake and warm bread pudding. Having just eaten a cow, I could only take a bite from each dessert. Too bad. The bread pudding was piping hot and enjoyable. I feel a food coma just thinking about our time here.

We went on a Friday so we got a halfpriced bottle of wine with dinner, which was awesome. To start I had ceasar salad, which was alright, nothing to write home about. But i wasn't expecting to overwhelm me, and I was also trying to save my tummy for the steak.Instead of getting filet mignon, which is what most people get in Restaurant Week situations, I opted for the Cajun Steak with mashed potatoes. Maybe the best decision I've made all year! The steak was so tender (flank steak I believe) and flavorful with the cajun spices and the garlic mashed potatoes. It was pretty close to perfect. It was also VERY filling. To the point that when I left I was so stuffed I barely even wanted to go out afterwards for a drink! Also, there weren't a lot of people in the restaurant, which honestly shouldn't have been surprising because the Financial DIstrict is a bona-fide barren wasteland after the hour of about 6pm, so I'm to guess it's easy to get dinner reservations there on a Friday night most of the time.

5.0,2/14/2012,"I recently enjoyed a wonderful dinner at this NYC institution in the heart of the financial district. Bobby Van's Steakhouse occupies a former bank lobby, designed back in the day when bank lobbies were grandiose places with high ceilings and carved moldings. The bar is classic wood, the service is outstanding, and the meal was terrific. But I'm getting ahead of myself.Bobby Van's is two restaurants: the steakhouse at street level with a grill restaurant in the basement. Not knowing better, we walked into the grill by mistake. We apparently weren't the first party to do this. The host was very helpful and gave us a personal tour of the bank vaults in the grill before taking us upstairs. The history was interesting, the vaults were amazing (you can reserve the large vault for private dinners), and our personal tour guide was delightful.Now for dinner. My bone-in NY Strip was cooked to a perfect medium rare. The chef gladly accommodated my request for blue cheese melted atop the steak and offered the perfect amount to complement the flavor of the high quality cut of beef. That, and a side of sauteed mushrooms and a delectable bottle of Cabernet Sauvignon made for a perfect rendition of my favorite meal.To be honest, Bobby Van's earned 5 stars with the personal tour of the bank vaults. Just goes to show the value of an outstanding first impression. The five were theirs to lose and the steakhouse lived up to the challenge.",2,0,0,Jeff S.,"Houston, TX",252,655,246

I did enjoy the mousse cake which they generously comped for us. Service was basically just a robot. He didn't really speak to us other than to ask for our orders. My date didn't really mind it except that he took away our apps before asking if we were finished with them.

The sauce surrounding my seafood was way too too salty. The cheese cake was decent. It lacked moisture. It desperately needed more of the berry sauce it came with. Which was under the cheese cake.

Although we made reservations, we were seated over by the bar in a table that was waaay to small to eat a proper steak dinner with sides on. So that was a little frustrating and disappointing. The food itself was adequate. I had the sesame tuna - it was good but again not great. The tuna was properly seared...mostly...the end pieces were overcooked and not pink at all. You gotta prepare tuna correctly! We had onion rings appetizers which were good. The asparagus was nice - but you really can't mess up asparagus (I hope!).

I've tried the steaks, the burger was tasteless, & when I've tried to order light after realizing I didn't really like the food here, I tried the$15 quesadilla, I know, $15 for a quesadilla? And how can you screw that up? Well, somehow they did. The salads were no better than you've seen in a cafeteria.  Oh wait, just remembered, the braised pork chop with the mashed potatoes was actually good.

3.0,12/24/2010,"I visited this restaurant during the week before Christmas as part of a work team lunch.  I work in the World Financial Center and we decided to try something outside our usual work-places.Overall, the experience wasn't bad.  I don't know that I would enthusiastically recommend it to others nor would I tell people to steer clear away from it.  The food was pretty good.  The food was well-cooked and with good sized portions.  The menu had a variety of options and while I wouldn't necessarily say there would be a number of options for a vegetarian (but then again, I don't know that a vegetarian would come here!), if you eat meat/fish/chicken, you should be able to find something.  Everyone in my group enjoyed their food and the entrees included everything from salads to steak. I had the pork chop and it was very good and well-cooked.  Have to admit - loved the mashed potatoes!!The reason I  gave the three stars was the quality of service.  First of all, no one smiled starting from the hostess all the way to the servers.  You would be amazed at how the lack of smiles impacts the quality of your experience.  Second, we had to ask repeatedly for various things including spoons for our after-dinner coffee, forks for our desserts.  In the end, we actually had to share forks and spoons because we gave up asking (and between us all, we must have asked at least four times!).You can definitely find better steakhouses in NYC.  I wouldn't recommend this if you have the ability to go to other neighborhoods.  But a relatively safe choice for a lunch or dinner if you are in the Financial District.",1,0,0,Anita P.,"New York, NY",2,29,0

My friend said the salmon was alright.  My fillet mignon was cook perfectly  However there was absolutely no flavor, no salt, pepper, or anything.

For this Bobby Van's they have many rooms/sections, one of them is a vault.  I wish I ate in there, maybe next time.The complimentary basket of bread consisted of assorted breads and crackers. There was one that had raisins and nuts? I'm not sure what kind of bread it was but it was delicious. I would of ate more but our table ran out =(For the appetizer I had the Caesar salad, I guess I'm a noob but I never had cheese sliced like that before and it was interesting to eat with the salad. Under all that were TWO croutons! I have to say I was disappointed at first because I didn't think there were any croutons, so it was pleasant surprise lol. For my entree I ordered the Roast Pork Loin with banana polenta and port wine sauce. It was okay ... I'm not a banana fan and after this dish I guess I'm not a banana polenta fan. The roast pork loin was nicely cooked though, the meat was very juicy. As for the port wine sauce, it was a bit too strong for me (I'm not a sauce-y person).I didn't order the filet mignon which had a $5 supplement charge although the menu online said that it was $10. It was a nice surprise and I wish I ordered it! I only tasted a bite but it was good. I'm not really a steak person or know much about it but I enjoyed it very much.Now... I'm usually iffy with mousse but their chocolate mousse was just heavenly. It was so soft and so light. I LOVE crunchy stuff and on the side of the chocolate mousse, consisted of some crunch which complemented the mousse extremely well. I really enjoyed it but after a few bites I was extremely full so I decided to get it to go. Sadly it melted but I decided to eat it anyway because it was too good to waste! EVEN in it's melty state, it was delich!Overall, I enjoyed Bobby Van's and for $33-$36 (with everything included) it was well worth it.

We were seated promptly but not given menus or even acknowledged for a good fifteen minutes until we flagged down a busyboy to request menus and water.

At $10, my glass of Sauvignon Blanc was not that large. I had the tomato and mozzarella starter which was nothing special and which had more yellow peppers than either main ingredient. For the entree, I had the scallops which were covered in a blizzard of capers and drowned in shitake mashed potatos. I'm one of those diners for whom Restaurant Week is a bit of a bad deal since I had no room left for dessert. I had a nibble of the famous bread pudding which tasted more like flan.

4.0,4/28/2008,"Great burgers ... but I'm an artist. I can't afford to eat a $20 burger. Ouch. My first clue should have been the atmosphere: An old bank vault converted into a fairly classy steak joint. What I need to do is find a Goldman Sachs sugar daddy.I was on jury duty the other day, and met a few former co-workers in this 'hood to catch up. I had a beef burger with cheddar and a side salad. It was excellent, and cooked perfectly. One of the people I was with asked for salad without the vinegarette, but I think that was too complicated for the cook staff. It ended up coming out TWICE with dressing.The drinks killed me too.

3.0,2/21/2008,"Formerly a center operating in financial services, Bobby Van's Steak House plays host as the signature Steak House in the Financial District.  Reminiscence of the former business still linger at this location, as despite the conversion from Bank to Restaurant, the management of this establishment has dedicated their decor to incorporate such fundamentals as teller counters safe deposit boxes, and the iron clad vault door acting as the ambiance.The service at this establishment was impeccable.  Careful attention to specials were greatly emphasized and questions regarding both wine and entrees were carefully explained.On to the food.Steak Tartare (appetizer): The presentation of this dish, was of all things, the least impressive of all other dishes that were made available to our disposal.  A ""scoop"" of what was relegated as ""Steak Tartare"" sat in the middle of a 12"" circumference plate surrounded by three slices of butter flavored toast.  The Steak Tartare was unfortunately off key.  The over emphasis and application of elements such as mayo, celery, and green chiles made this dish appear as a bad version of tuna salad.  From the first bite of the Tartare, it was evident that the texture and quality of the steak was subpar as the secondary elements that played host to this dish overwhelmed the taste of the meat.  The burdensome corpulent flavors generated by the combination of the mayo, celery, and green chiles dominated the overall consistency and taste of this dish, leaving a diner to wonder if this preparation could've been done at their own kitchen?12 oz. NY Sirloin (Main Course):  The saving grace of this dining experience can be found in one of Bobby Van's Steak applications.  The NY Sirloin (cooked rare of course) provided the texture and consistency of a true grade A cut of beef.  The moist and soft texture of the steak greatly aided in the circulation of juices, that's released through equal distribution of the marbling, leaving a diner to a savory delight.  With each passing bite of the Sirloin, a consumer will find that the first is as good as the last.  There is minimal hindrance of flavors between bites due to the distribution of the marbling.  The spices used in the application did not overwhelm the beef.  Rather, the spices acted as a supporting cast to the steak by enhancing the richness of the cut.Overall expectations of the steak at Bobby Vans was fair compared to that of its more notable counterparts (Smith & Wollensky, Peter Lugar's Steak House).  The steak quality is of top notch and is worth tasting at least once.  When ordering, remember to indulge in class by ordering a bottle of dry wine (we ordered the 2000 Borgonono Barolo Riserva).  And of course, avoid the Tartare at all cost!",1,1,1,C M.,"New York, NY",266,454,791

4.0,9/10/2007,"Lunch in the Vault at Bobby Van's is an afternoon treat that will also keep your alteration bills down by preventing any money that you might have had before lunch from burning a hole in your pocket.As others have mentioned, the restaurant has a lower entrance that leads down to the old bank vault, since converted to a restaurant.  The main dining area has a nice feel to it, particularly for steakhouse style dining.  I had the petite fillet mignon which was quite good and, at 10oz, was a perfectly satisfying lunch in combination with house salad and calamari appetizer.  The meat has a nicely pronounced flavor and is very tender, although it isn't melt-in-your-mouth (not in your hand) tender.It seems appropriate that for a restaurant located in a bank vault across from the stock exchange, some financial commentary and advice should come with your meal.  You won't find this on the menu at Bobby Van's, so I'll offer it up here.  With the recent surge in ethanol usage in the U.S., which now consumes 26% of the nation's corn output, up from 11% five years ago, corn prices have risen 50% over that time.  (see ""The Search for the Perfect Steak, The Wall Street Journal, Sept. 8, 2007).  Corn feeding makes for good beef and as a result, there has been a concurrent rise in steak prices.  As restaurants are loathe to change menu prices on a daily basis simply because of fluctuations in the commodities markets, prices have soared to reflect both the cost increase and the risk premium associated with recent volatility in the market.  What does this mean for the high end steak addict and the summer grill masters, and what can they do to deal with it?  For those who need a regular fix of steak (and really, what self respecting American doesn't?), some hedging might be in order.  If you're feeding a family of four with a few steaks each per week, the impact on your pocketbook is going to be measurable.  One option would be to pool your money with similarly situated steak consumers and invest in corn futures on the CME.  Rebalancing and transaction costs could be trouble but planned well, you could probably structure an annualized or quarterly financial derivative that lines your pockets with corn proceeds as prices in that commodity rise.  That way, when you're out at Bobby Van's downing yet another lunch time steak with your buddies, even as your pocket book is taking a hit when the check comes you know that your margin account with Chase is being fattened by an offsetting amount.With some clever work and a little entrepreneurship, you might one day start up a successful steak-based boutique hedge fund that, for a hefty fee, can help the steak consuming restaurants and populous of this fine nation cope with a changing and volatile market.  Just be sure to cash out before the regulators start investigating and perhaps one day you'll be filling up a bank vault of your own, rather than just paying to eat in one.",1,2,1,Andrew M.,"New York, NY",2,19,0

4.0,7/26/2007,"Definitely a place to consider in the Fiancial District when the boss is paying. I wouldn't put it in the class of Peter Luger's or any of the great steak houses out there, but it definitely deserves a place on the next level below.They keep the restaurant week menu going for most of the year, so for $24 you have the option of the Soup Du Jour or a salad for an app, Salmon, Chicken Marsala, Skirt Steak or Filet Mignon(For $10 more) for mains, with the option of Chocolate Mousse or Cheese Cake for desert. If you order off the main menu, you'll find it more expansive than usual with a number of good vegetarian options. Just about everything is quite good, but you're hard pressed to find somethign that will wow you. Aside from that, prices are about average for a steak house in New York City, which is to say, it's great for when you don't have to pay (as if I haven't emphasized this enough for you).The bank vault setting is quite cool and it isn't as stuffy as some Steak Houses can be. With the location, you're bound to run into a Politico or CEO so you never know (On my visit I ran into a former Presidential Candidate).
