4.0,5/1/2019,"My friend and I were really excited to go here and we waited almost two hours to be seated. Four stars ONLY because of the aesthetic. The servers were not very professional and a lot of them seemed confused all the time. Our server took about 10 minutes to take our order and another 10 minutes to give us our check and another 10 minutes just to sign the receipt. The food was mediocre, but on the bright side, the shrimp was poached very nicely and the texture was incredible.",0,0,0,Jamie P.,"New York, NY",587,36,36

4.0,4/27/2019,"When I saw pictures of this gorgeous rooftop restaurant, I just knew I needed to pay a visit for an upcoming day trip to New York City.Located on the rooftop of Eataly, this restaurant will take you into what feels like an floral and picturesque alternate reality. This has to be one of the most beautiful locations I've ever dined in.I made reservations for 11:30am on a Wednesday. I thought it wouldn't be busy since it was their opening time during the week, but there was a line waiting to check in well before 11:30, and the restaurant filled in pretty quickly after being seated. I do think there could have been a bit more organization with checking in; people were standing around not knowing whether to form a line and I saw a few guests' confusion, including ourselves.The menu is rather small, but the food is good. I did prefer the taste of my boyfriend's chicken entree over my pesto gnocchi.The service was good and moved at a reasonable speed.I'd come back again for the ambiance.",1,0,0,Rita Y.,"Norristown, PA",135,129,43

Our server wore sunglasses and continuously walked passed us as we were trying to order our dessert so I just got up walked over to him and asked for our check.  The bus boys were more attentive than the waiting staff.. def not going to this one again.

5.0,4/26/2019,"We had reservations for brunch on a Thursday morning at 11:30 AM when the restaurant opens. I was worried it would be quiet and would have less ambiance that early in the day but I was pleasantly surprised!From start to finish the staff was really attentive and made a fuss about our group! We were celebrating a birthday and our waitress surprised us with a birthday candle with dessert.For apps we ordered the 5 cheeses plate. We liked 4 of the 5 cheeses. It came with fig jam.  We also ordered the arancini, which tasted so fresh and yummy. It was probably my favorite dish!For entrees, we ordered the pesto gnocchi and Vesuvio pasta. Both were fresh and tasty. Let's be honest, the ambiance is why people visit. It's very pretty and instagramable! Will definitely be back.",0,0,0,Kimberley P.,"Manhattan, NY",112,28,20
2.0,4/25/2019,"We went on Easter Sunday for brunch, so keep in mind a less busy time may provide a different experience. BUT I think this place is WAY overhyped. For one, the size dishes for what you pay for is not fair and honestly I didn't think the food was that great. My husband had the Wagyu steak with potatoes, which was the best plate of our group. One person ordered an arugula salad which was literally a large bowl of arugula. Period. Nothing in it. Service was also awful. It took over an hour to get our food after ordering.  I think what you pay for here is the atmosphere. I'd recommend just going for a drink for the rooftop restaurant and enjoying the downstairs market, as the food is definitely not the best in the city.",0,0,0,Hayley B.,"Newtown, CT",86,170,35
1.0,4/25/2019,PLEASE heed my warning. just go to the bar and maybe re-evaluate your life choices that brought you to this moment where you decided this was the restaurant you wanted to eat at. I wanted to like this place I really did but the food and service was horrid. My pork was terribly seasoned and came basically by itself...for 26$. The gnocchi we got was very mushy and terribly sauced. The server refused to give us more bread and it took 20 minutes to give us change as we paid. This place is ONLY worth it for the ambience which again you can get by just getting a slightly overpriced drink.,0,0,0,Matt F.,"Manhattan, NY",0,5,0
1.0,4/24/2019,"Don't get fooled by this decor. this restaurant booking and reservations management is very ridiculous. I put my name on the waiting list when l walked in, they told me the waiting hour is one hour and 45 mins, it's long enough right? l said okay as long as they let me in after the waiting. However, we were there on time and the waiter told me have another 20 mins to wait. Fine. Then when we checked in after that, the other waitress told me there are still 10 tables in front of us and the estimate time was not accurate!!! They have no idea how long to wait then. After two hours waiting and you told clients you don't know how long to wait? ! Why you set the estimate time and lie???They said that the reservation ppl are in privilege. We checked inside, there are at least 5 tables available and no one is served. The waitress said they are reserved. This means the restaurant would  rather let the table empty than let the current clients in. So this restaurant technically treat onsite clients as what??? Indifference？Our time is not valuable? Also, they seems don't care about this reviews. They don't want to improve the ridiculous management. I am writing this review to share my horrible experience with you in case you will waste your time on this non-worth restaurant to waste your money and time to buy this RUDE and CARELESS service.    By the way, we are only Asian in the line. I am not sure if this cause a reason to be played as a fool. Good luck folks!",2,0,0,Bo Z.,"New York, NY",37,7,1
4.0,4/24/2019,"Serra was delightful for a lovely spring evening! The atmosphere here is certainly a 5- with the whole top floor being covered in beautiful colors of bright colors. The drinks were delicious, strong and a decent size. We ordered a few tasting dishes and split an entree and had plenty of food. First we ordered the asparagus anti pasta dish, arancini, burratta and the bread. Those were all very tasty. We then split the Vesuvio which was light with little sauce but a whole lot of flavor. For dessert we split the tiramisu and the chocolate ganache dolci- both I would get again!! The only reason this restaurant didn't receive a 4 was the service. They were very slow, and fairly inattentive. We had to stop them several times to ask for things such as utensils and water refills. I just think for the amount of workers see they could do better.",0,0,0,Devon L.,"Philadelphia, PA",242,55,21
3.0,4/23/2019,"Five stars for ambience and decor. It's truly a very pretty sight. We did get lucky and managed to score a table last Friday. But our server was trying desperately to not show that he wanted us eat drink and leave ASAP. Everyone was in a rush. I get it, they were crowded. But that doesn't mean we are not going to enjoy. Not that we are not spending money!! Disappointed with the service. Food is okay but overpriced. Again I get we are paying for the rooftop and the beautiful decor. Cheese is good. The bread was very hard although doused with olive oil. My Vesuvio was okay not good not great. The gnocchi for the table was also just okay. I did like their bruschetta. What was really amazing was theprosciutto and arancini. Definitely order with your cocktails. Ok so speaking of cocktailsDA POSITANO CON AMORE is basically House Made Limoncello with a bunch of other stuff. I did get the tequila coming through but honestly I expected a better cocktail for all the ingredients that were there. SPRITZ BIANCO- frankly the best of the lot. Pretty refreshing and spritz-ySPRITZ viola- could be so much better. Tastes like nothing really. Has a faint taste of the violetSPRITZ NERO- WHAT WAS THAT! Waste of money that.The mandorla dessert was good. CROSTATA ALLE PERE - okay as well but I'm personally not a fan of frangipane.So I really like eataly and have a few pantry items that come from there. So I don't mind overpaying for food there. But it has to be good. I'm disappointed because service and food and drinks were substandard. But what pretty decor!",1,0,0,Dolonchapa C.,"New York, NY",166,279,869
2.0,4/21/2019,"The two stars are mainly for the decor. Which unfortunately makes it a highly Instagramable atmosphere.Service was just a mess of disinterested servers. Unless you're dressed as an instagram model dont expect good service. Our server, Tyler, dropped the ball many times during our visit. Dirty plates were left on the table, he ignored us several times and on top of it he was extremely patronizing. We were asked if there any allegies and I said gluten, nothing was explained about what I could have. He did however make sarcastic jokes (instead of explaining anything) about my choice because it contained a pasta that I did not recognize it's name. So I did have to change my order since I could not substitute anything (understandable). Through out lunch our water cups were empty. Our food was brought out and our server never came to check how it came out. My steak came out medium instead of medium rare, never got to remediate that because Tyler checked on both tables to our side but completely skipped us several times. The food was not bad. We never got to try as many things as we wanted, when we decided to add another app, our server didn't even bother to fully stop by the table but he kinda of answered my question about an app as he walked away. Cheese platter - we picked a mix of hard, semi hard and fresh cheeses and they were all delicious with a side of fig compote.The waygu steak - was super tender even at medium doneness and the potatoes with salsa verde were crispy on the outside and so nice and buttery. The sausage - was amazing, best dish of the day, accompanied by brocolli rabe, mustard and some sweet and spicy chillies.Never got to dessert because we were too dissatisfied with the service. We hunted him down as he was helping another table to ask for a dessert menu and it was nonchalantly thrown at our table while the dirty plates were still staring at us as a reminder of the disappointing service. That was the last drop. After that we wanted nothing more than to leave.

You have hundreds of pastas downstairs in the market and you're only serving one in this restaurant?I had the one pasta dish which wasn't terrible, but also not the best. The free bread they bring to the table tastes like cardboard. All of my friends felt unsatisfied after coming here, one didn't even eat because the menu was so terrible.

The best time to go is probably around 7, when the sun is setting and the lights are on. Gives it a real intimate setting.Our server was nice, and my was never devoid of water for long. Unfortunately, there's where good things end.I made a reservation for 7:15, got there on time. We were seated promptly. We ordered 2 glasses of wine (pretty decent) and went on to order food. We originally just wanted to get the 3 cheese board and prosciutto but our server told us if we didn't get an entree or another item, he'd have to move us to the bar as there were 1.5 hour wait times. Since we wanted to enjoy the scenery, we reluctantly ordered the pollo. Cheese and prosciutto were pretty decent. The pollo was terrible. For the price, it was extremely lacking in flavor. The asparagus tasted like it was drowned in lemon. The whole night, there were plenty of empty tables remaining, not what our server said of there being long waits. Overall, great place for a date but I'd confirm about the number of dishes needed to be ordered to keep a table. What's the point of a reservation?",0,0,0,Andrew C.,"New York, NY",217,161,250
4.0,4/17/2019,"Gorgeous scenic lunch spot. Came here for lunch on a Tuesday afternoon. Luckily they take walk ins and we waited at the bar for about 45 minutes. Didn't mind waiting because we were able to sit at a high top table and order a pitcher to drink the time away! The pitchers are pretty well made for $35 and perfect to share between 2 people for a light buzz! The pitcher allowed us to have 2 glasses each. Not bad since each cocktail on the menu runs you about $15 anyway. Once we were seated we were quickly served. I ordered the prosciutto and a cheese board and my friend got the rice balls. I thought the food was delicious but the menu seemed a bit limited. The main attraction of this place was the instagram-worthy pics. This rooftop restaurant was covered in flowers, fake unfortunately but still really pretty.

The food is OK but could overall use more flavor. I had the gnocchi and I think it was lacking some salt. The service was kinda trash. And although our server didn't take our order and abandon us it did take like 30 minutes for her to even take our order..

Me, cheese, and wine. A love story.But Serra was a true disappointment. I ordered a cheese platter. Expecting a cheese platter, i was served 3 tiny cubes of cheese. Like?? Why did they skimp on the fucking cheese?? It literally cost $20. Fucking Italians. This place is located on Eataly's Rooftop. And don't get me wrong, the roof is BEAUTIFUL in the spring. It is entirely covered in floors and the sun shines through. But my god, the wine and cheese were overpriced and subpar. The service was also HORRIBLE. It's like they'd never worked there before. I hate being hard on the service, because it's tough being a waiter/tress. But man, the waiter was truly not attentive and forgot every single thing we ordered, including napkins and utensils.

2.0,4/12/2019,"The good: The garden grove cocktail was delicious. The spring decor is cute.The bad: The decor is cute, but it's pretty much all fake flowers, which isn't as impressive?The menu was bizarrely priced. Dishes like $17 pasta or $21 chicken seem like a good price point. Then, on the other side of the spectrum, pork chops were $47 for some reason. $16 glass of red wine was acidic and thin and tasted as though it wasn't properly stored.We were a group of eight people, so we ordered a fair variety of food:Every single dish was all terribly under-seasoned. I think that's where the real problem lies, based on the number of reviewers here who said they needed to heap on salt, pepper, and cheese to taste any flavor. The food was basically like, ""Here's some plain boiled couscous with bits of cut up asparagus."" Boring and uninspired. Out of all the food, two salads came out last while everyone else was served their hot food. The food serving timing was really off. The people who ordered salads sat for most of the meal without any food.When asked about their house-made limoncello, they said they didn't have any. But it's on the cocktail menu. Someone's cutting corners. A lot. This being a restaurant, it's only fair to receive most of your stars based on the food. And the food was underwhelming.Conclusion:I see your gimmick. Use the decor to attract customers interested in visiting for instagram. Sad that mediocre restaurants flourish while restaurants with better food struggle to stay afloat.Please.

We shared the kale salad and prosciutto which were both delicious. The gnocchi was good but not as good as the lumache which was my favorite of the things we tried.

3.0,4/2/2019,Okay this place is novelty and the seasonal decor is definitely beautiful. But seriously food is sub par as well as the service. We did the spring special menu and understandably came on the last day so they ran out of a lot of things.

The food itself is pretty average. We had a couple of yummy things but it's all def over priced but our waiter was awesome and recommended some really good dishes and it was a beautiful day. If you're coming for the best Italian meal you've ever eaten then you should go downstairs to one of those restaurants but the spring design was GORGEOUS and worth every penny of our meal.Standouts: the ambience and decorations, lumanche, prosciutto Could live without: gnocchi, their bread",3,0,0,Sidney H.,"Washington, DC",499,98,69

1.0,4/1/2019,"There's a special kind of misery in NYC in the form of poorly run, well-themed, and extremely busy restaurants.  They draw tremendous crowds, treat them poorly, drive their staff insane, and as fast as they possibly can.  Like a misery factory.  Assembly-line rage.They were out of everything. Tried three different cocktails on Monday night at 6pm before settling on a disappointed aperol spritz.  For $35.Menu was a wreck - in fact we were given two different ones.  Trying to craft a meal or a well composed snack out of either felt nearly impossible.  It was more groceries than meal.  The small PLATES menu had more than one soup on it, the waiter had to ask if we really wanted a solo soup.  We did not.  Charcuterie options included only prosciutto. Arancini were cold, and a convenient 3 were delivered to our party of 2.  Cheese sampler included cheeses too hard to cut with a knife. A block of Pecorino Romano is not a good bar snack. Each cheese had substantial rind or dryness, it was as if I'd just paid $17 for the cheese trimmings from Eataly.  Because I did.Ordered bread from the menu. Complimentary bread was also delivered. Free bread was better. It was deafeningly loud and tables were too close together to get in and out without moving them.  Service was subpar - understaffed, hard to hear, and it was so cramped in our spot that I could not even really turn around to hear her tell me all the things they were out of.1 star for lovely ceiling.  Not recommended.",3,0,0,David C.,"Downtown, Seattle, WA",1,92,14

I booked 2 weeks in advance a dinner reservation for myself and 4 friends at 10 pm on a Saturday evening. Upon arrival at Eataly, there was a bit of confusion on where to go and came across wall signs that directed us to corner elevators where we arrived what looked like a host podium. We were checked in and instructed to take the elevator to the 14th floor. Even though we had reservations we were told to wait. Found this unusual but, we waited. We were sat and greeted by a server assistant who was assisting on the floor which I am assuming was due to the large amount of guests.My friends and I all ordered from the restaurant week menu and ordered two bottles of wine. I had a large lunch and did not have an appetite but, could not pass on an appetizer. I ordered the bruschetta con ricotta which was warm and toasty and reminded me of a chilly afternoon. Mid way our server was changed and we were blessed with the presence of Taylor( t Ai - l er) who was pleasant, amable and charismatic.

We were seated about 15 minutes after our reservation which was fine. Atmosphere is a bit loud and tables are close together but the food and service are outstanding! Bread was brought to the table which we quickly devoured because we were starving. Nicole C was our server and she apologized for the time it took her to get to us. We ordered right away and our drinks came quickly. I had a glass of wine which resulted in a larger pour as an apology for the wait and he got the Italian cola. We had the polenta and the cheese tasting for an appetizer. Dinner was the steak and pasta with pesto (the gnocchi was subbed for a different pasta because they ran out). Dessert was cappuccino, latte, the panna cotta and the chocolate dessert (sadly out of tiramisu). Our glasses of water were constantly refilled, the attention from Nicole was outstanding and the food was incredible. Come during the daylight and stay while it gets dark.

If any of the above apply to you, I'd definitely recommend making reservations at Serra! Came here with my girlfriends on a Saturday night and this place was deservedly packed! The flowers (fake but beautifully arranged everywhere!!), the rooftop setting and brightly lit area, the food and a decent selection of wines all contributed to an amazing atmosphere to catch up with friends. My one complaint with this place is the constant feeling of being rushed. It seemed like the waiter was eager to take our plates away before we were finished! It's understandable because there's so many people waiting to come in but we're paying customers too. TIPS: 1. MAKE RESERVATIONS! I called to make our reservation for a party of 5 because opentable was telling me that they were fully booked for any party of more than 4 so just call! 2. Leave room for dessert downstairs! Serra offers a wide variety of desserts but we wanted to try the options downstairs (the gelato and cannolis!) so we only got a couple desserts for our table.

After ordering the food, the appetizer came out fast in 10 minutes. After 30 minutes, pasta and main dish didn't come out, so I asked to her (woman) ""When our pasta  is coming"" she answered just "" Yeah"" and I thought what is yes??? so I asked her again is coming??? and she said again ""yeah"" and i didnt have any words. In one hour I talked to her only for ordering our food and that's that!!I Iunderstand for late cuz after opening lunch time should be very busy in kitchen but she didn have any words with us what was she wrong with us? And after 40 min we got pasta finally  actually I couldnt enjoy anymore cuz her service was awful. no words no smile She asked if was everything ok only to the french customers ( they finished all for 10 min )they set next to us and they came after us. I know giving tip is very important in the USA. my mind is that "" when you dont have money for tipping dont go to the restaurant ""also if the service is good, I must pay more than 20 percent of bill .Why she started to smile at the end when I received my bill from her?? did she helpful to me? absolutely not! the other guy who took the pasta and taking care of us gave better service and  I left 15 % for tip not for her but for him actually I wanted give her only 1 penny :( I loved Eataly very much, and I lived in Italy for lon time. so Italian food is part of my life but not this place not anymore everybody can make mistake but not being rude with the other people. please do not drawing circle on suggested tip option  receipt cuz your intention was not smart se siete italiani turisti andate per il cocktail o aperitivo ma non per i piatti di pasta peche ci sono tanti ristoranti che fanno meglio di qui  ~",0,0,0,Silvia L.,"Sparks, NV",6,9,21

She agreed to it but got me a new dish within 60 seconds (clearly she did not replace the gnocchi and just re-tossed the existing one).

Eataly, man.We ordered a variety of dishes--sausage + polenta, gnocchi, chicken with butternut squash, and the pork shoulder with celery root and apples. We also ordered two of the pane otto starter because we didn't realize they brought bread for the table, but it was still worth it. Overall, the general consensus was that the food was underwhelming. The gnocchi was fine with a very subtle flavor, but nothing outstanding. Sausage and polenta was, I quote, ""glorified bangers and mash."" Two friends who ordered the chicken with butternut squash both reported weirdly salty chicken. But the pork shoulder was allegedly one of the best my friend has had. Regardless, you're paying mostly for the Eataly ~experience~ and not the food. Stop by any other nearby Italian restaurant for excellent food or just grab something at the smaller Eataly counters.The service was friendly and accommodating.

The protein dishes have always done me more good than the pasta dishes here. 2 appetizers, 2 entrees, and a glass of beer is more than satisfying for those with a relatively small to normal stomach. You can do no wrong with the potatoes, fried brussel sprouts, skewers, and pork shoulder. For me, the ambiance, service speed, and price points all make Serra deserving of 4 stars?

Our waiter also ignored us completely after bringing our food; the wait for attention was so long that we decided to skip dessert and just ask for the check when we finally managed to wave him down, at which point he tried to overcharge us by $20 (and later blamed the mistake on an unseen manager).The food is also pretty underwhelming. The raclette is decent, but the tortiglioni is surprisingly bland for a $35 entree claiming to have truffle in it (couldn't taste any).

3.0,1/27/2019,"So this place is cute. I came here twice, once sat at the bar upon opening, and another for dinner reservations. Id Like to give this 3 and a half stars, but they never let half. First off, It is above Eataly, which, in itself was a delight. You can wander down here for some time, as there are plenty of places for a small bite, glass of wine, or dinner. You can shop around (check out venchi chocolates, as they are DELICIOUS) explore the cheeses, wander around in the olive oil, and make sure you grab some pastas or truffle to take home. In sitting at the bar, I had no reservations but I was alone and just wanted a drink, so it was easy to get in. The place was adorably decorated, a lovely winter pop up. I sat at the bar and had a drink of mulled wine. It was good and the bartender was quite friendly. I showed up right at opening and by the time I left the place was packed. Secondly, I made dinner reservations. Myself and three friends for a Saturday night, and I believe our wait time was about two minutes. That was probably the least amount of time we waited for anything. It was definitely a bit busy, but service was a little on the slow side. Ordered drinks, and I got a cocktail (pear and egg white, which usually are right up my alley) Cocktails were a little bit of a letdown, and perhaps that was because this is better known for wine. I should've stuck with that as the drinks were a bit underwhelming. We ordered a few plates to share, including the beets and mozzarella, which was a treat, as well as the Raclette and potatoes. I was hoping to love this, as I LOVE Raclette, however, also came out a little underwhelming. As I've ordered this elsewhere, usually, they scrape the cheese directly onto the potatoes. This just came out with a pile of cheese on a plate. The toasted bread that came with it was delicious. The delicious crusty heaping mound of bread that we ordered was amazing as well.  Our last treat was a cauliflower, and that was good as well. All in all, this was a cute stop. A little lackluster, all everything just kind of missed the mark. Nothing BAD, but nothing that really makes me want to go back again and again. I would try this again in summer perhaps, but I think I'd stick to just wine, and probably stay at the bar!",1,0,1,Holly M.,"New York, NY",165,46,164

1.0,1/25/2019,"This is the first time that I've ever been compelled to write a yelp review. Friends and I decided to splurge for our final night before classes began, and decided to brave the cold for a great meal. The website for this restaurant says ""escape the freezing streets of Manhattan and let winter melt away."" No where was it advertised that the only heating in the restaurant was from heat lamp. Even though we asked for another heat lamp, we were unable to get one. We certainly did not ""melt away"" considering that it was twelve degrees Fahrenheit inside of the restaurant. To add insult to injury, when we asked for something to help warm us up, we were charged four dollars per cup of tea. We had to keep our jackets on the entire time, and by the end of our night we were passing around the tea for warmth. Three of us decided to order the cauliflower after being told that it was a type of pasta, so imagine our surprise when it was a literal head of cauliflower fried. The food came out of the kitchen lukewarm, which makes sense considering that again, it was twelve degrees inside. Overpriced and insanely disappointing, words can not explain how miserable our experience was. P.S yelp should make it possible to have zero stars",0,0,0,Rhea S.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",233,1,0
4.0,1/25/2019,"My boyfriend surprised me with reservations here while we spent a day in the city. We were a little early but happily browsed the selections below at Eataly. When it was time to be seated we took an elevator up and climbed a flight of stairs to a beautiful open restaurant! This place is instagram worthy for sure. The beautiful pink and white garland and branches made me feel like I was perched on the top roof in a little nest. They had heat lamps, but it was still a little chilly in the restaurant. We ordered beers to start and a salad and a cheese board. The salad was bitter, but the apple sweetened it. Overall a delicious, light salad. The cheese board was standard and can be easily split between 2 people to share. For our meals we ordered the polenta and the cauliflower. To be honest, I wasn't a huge fan of either dish, but they satisfied us. The cauliflower was too oily from being fried and the polenta had a weird cheesy flavor I wasn't a fan of. I think if we were a little hungrier and ordered different dishes we would have enjoyed it more. The service was fantastic and quick!

We really enjoyed the holiday lights and setting.The meal started out great with the honeynut squash. That was actually very very good.The meal went south with the main entrees. The tortiglioni all's norcina (a fairly high priced pasta dish) had no taste. It was bland. I have definitely had better cooked pasta with the texture. Not what I was expecting in Eataly. The maiale alla birra was a pork shoulder but honestly I was eating 60/70% fat compared to the meat. Probably a totally of 2/3oz of meat. That was a disappointment for sure. We had to go downstairs to the eataly markets to have more food afterwards. I think that says something.

4.0,1/7/2019,"Serra is located on the roof at Eataly and is always beautifully decorated for the holidays. You truly feel like you are walking into a winter wonderland during the Christmas season.  The natural light paired with the extensive, but not gaudy, decorations gives it the appearance of a piece of beautiful glass art on display.  It is VERY packed, however, so I would not recommend this for an ""intimate"" date.  The sheer volume of people makes it very noisy and you are close enough to your neighbors to bump elbows if you aren't paying attention.  I would highly recommend making a reservation if you are working around other plans or want to get seated in a timely manner.  I didn't have any of the food so I can't speak to that, but I found it to be an absolutely love place to have a bottle of afternoon champagne with friends.  We had a great time and enjoyed the festiveness of the whole place.  They have a lot of bar top tables, regular seating tables, and a couple cozy cushioned chairs tucked away under an archway separated from the main crowd.

The two previous times were great but this time we were seated and did not have a waiter come to our table for 30 minutes even after asking multiple people for a waiter. Once the waiter came we ordered everything at once and he came out with the wrong drinks. After apologizing and bringing us the correct drinks the food was then served later on and they forgot someone's meal so everyone sat awkwardly for 10 minutes waiting for the 4th person to get their food. When the bill finally came they billed us for the wrong drinks that were brought out! Which maybe if they left them at the table for us to drink they could charge us for them but they took them away without us taking more than a sip, so $15 x two drinks they charged us for their mistake and wouldn't accept anything else. This was very poor service considering each person was paying a $75 meal.

The decor is extremely festive and the ambiance was just perfect. Unfortunately the seating is a bit tight as my girlfriend and I were seated next to another couple and it felt as though we were sitting with them. As you can read from other reviews the experiences are hit or miss. Tonight the food was fantastic. My girlfriend and I started with a bottle of wine (highly recommend as it is cheaper than getting a few glasses) and the bread appetizer with olive oil, butter and whipped lardo. For an entree, my girlfriend ordered the Assiago which she LOVED, I also loved my dinner. I chose the sweet Italian sausage pasta with black truffle oil/cream sauce. All of the food was incredible. The service is what lacked and we were disappointed because otherwise our experience was good. Our waiter just didn't seem to into working tonight and was a hot mess. My dinner was given to me and being the gentleman I am waited for the other entree to come. By the time it came my dinner was cold - and I mean COLD. When asking how long it would be we were told there was a long line of plates waiting for the cheese to be melted on. I wish they would have factored that in and either put my dish under a heat lamp or just waited to cook it. We needed to ask multiple times for our waters to be filled. Overall, it just did not feel as though we were benign valued as patrons.

After being seated and getting water, our server disappeared for probably fifteen minutes. By this point we knew what we wanted, so we placed the whole order at once. After about fifteen minutes, literally our entire order came out in a span of ten minutes. Typically, a restaurant will bring drinks out quickly and let you enjoy and then follow with appetizers, which they also let you enjoy, and then the entree. There was no thought to the spacing here. Both appetizers came before the drinks and the entrees came when we had just started eating/drinking.

4.0,1/5/2019,"This rooftop changes seasonally and is hit-or-miss. Go in with the mindset you'll be paying more for the winter decor (it is beautiful and so festive!) and you'll leave happy. Cocktails are very good, food is decent if you order smartly! I would recommend everything we tried. Cocktails: My favorite was the Old Fashioned Affumicato (5/5) - festive, slightly chocolatey and delicious! The Nocella Manhattan (4.5/5) was a close second, followed by our amaro digestifs La Regina (4/5, lighter and very pretty with foam) and citta della notte (3.5/5, more alcohol with intense star anise and cinnamon). Food: Mozzarella di Bufala (4/5): a more flavorful mozzarella made with buffalo milk, about the size of a clementine. I really enjoy this kind of mild milky cheese - save some bread for this! Zucca arrostita (4/5): 1/2 small squash very similar to butternut squash, roasted tender, its cavity filled with mild stracciatella cheese and drizzled with hazelnut vinaigrette for a little more nuttiness. Funghi e Farro (4.5/5): high rating for flavor, I was really into the roasted mushrooms + chewy grains, dressed in a lemony sauce over a schmear of garlic aioli. Earthy and flavorful, but small.Maiale alla Birra (5/5): about 6 oz of fatty beer-braised pork; super tender with a sweet apricot glaze over a refreshing slaw of celery root, apples, and whole grain mustard. Really well-composed and had a lot of good flavor. I'd advise AGAINST the arugula salad, which we almost ordered until it arrived at our neighbor's table. It looked pretty sad and small, not worth $14. The pasta portions I saw were also very small.The service is spotty and can be slow, but everyone was nice - just like in Italy. TLDR: Recommend for good cocktails and some small plates in a beautiful atmosphere, as long as you're not in a hurry.

2.0,1/4/2019,"2 stars is a ""Meh"" experience according to Yelp, and this Eataly Rooftop restaurant does not even deserve that. It is more ""eh"" then ""Meh"", boom roasted. Before I get going here, don't let this rooftop take away from the Eataly experience, just ignore it even exists. Since I have eaten on the rooftop at eataly I have had nightmares from the elevator they make you take to the top. I would rather buy a fast pass in Disney World and ride the Tower of Terror all day than have to ride that elevator just to eat a sauceless bowl of pasta. That brings me to my next point - pasta needs sauce, every foodie knows this. If I wanted something dry, I would ask my Irish grandmother to make me cabbage. Lets take a step back, the meat and cheese board couldn't feed a starving infant! It is pretty much a small and pathetic excuse for a lunchable that I would bring to the first day of elementary school in a brown paper bag. Onto the service, we were rushed out of there, because god forbid Jim, the CEO at a NY company who lives in upper east side has to wait 2 more minutes for his table. I rush when my alarm doesn't go off for work, I do not rush when I am trying to put myself in a food coma and induce my blood stream with red wine.

The reservation was set for January 1st at 10:30PM. I received a phone call on December 30th and was told that the restaurant closes at 10PM this night and that my reservation would be for 9:30PM instead-- which was fine. I asked if I can make the reservation for 4 people, instead of for 2. The man on the phone shrieked ""Oh, lord!""  I then asked whether or not it was possible and he said that he ""guessed so"" and ""good luck to me.""  I came 30 minutes early to my reservation and asked for my table. He said that we will not be seated at a table, but rather, we must sit at the bar, even though we had reservations. We insisted that we weren't just having drinks, and he still said that we must sit at the bar, even though there were several tables open. We walked away to the bar section and I was notified that my reservation had been canceled by the restaurant. Why would I have made a reservation weeks in advance, only for it to be cancelled simply because we ""weren't having dinner""?  Furthermore, the reservation time had been changed from originally 10:30 PM to 9:30 PM (on the phone) and then again the restaurant changed it to 1:30 PMTo conclude, I reserved a table weeks prior only to have been told that he will not, in fact, be given the table that we reserved.

It was moderately expensive for an Italian place, and we hoped that meant it was going to be fantastic. After we ordered, we got some sort of cold oiled bread.

The rosemary butter was FANTASTIC. It was the best thing I had that night.For a main dish, I got the Gnocchi de Patate con Gorgonzola. It was really nothing special. The portion size was small.

Took almost 40 minutes for our drinks to arrive-shocking since the waitstaff had a separate wine fridge to pour the wine themselves, had to beg for water refills and a small cup of bread which was neccessary because it took over an hour for our food to arrive. When it did arrive, my daughte'rs salad wasn't there... but rather than waiting another 30 minutes for it, we said to just remove it from the bill-of course they did not. The waiter actually knew what I was waving him over for, so why didn't he remove it before handing it to me? My sister and I were splitting the $200 bill for lunch for 4 (mind you my 19 year old had 3 meatballs for lunch since her salad didn't make it to the table and 2 glasses of wine were the only beverages), and the bill conveniently listed an 18% tip and a 20% tip-but the amount suggested is what it should be for the entire bill, not for your half of the bill....very sneaky and deplorable for the restaurant management to do this. I have never tipped under 20%, but tipped 18% only so our busboy would get a little something! The food is average at best, and everything was in extremely small portions.

3.0,12/22/2018,"Winter Wonderland? I mean I don't know about that, yes there is winter decor and hangings from the ceiling that look really cool as you're walking up the stairs about to approach the restaurant but once you're up there, it's really nothing spectacular. We came around 4 o'clock on a Wednesday early evening because I had heard this place was a must try during the holidays. We appreciated the fact that there was no line and the bartenders were really great, they were quick and very aware of who was waiting for a drink, super nice too. They had these little hut type areas, but they were for people who were dining in only and you were separated by a rope at the bar so it was difficult to walk freely around the rooftop. I'm not sure, maybe this is just me but I just got a chain restaurant vibe, it was weird, maybe it was the lighting or the kids everywhere or maybe it was just the particular time we came in but the vibe wasn't really romantic or whimsical or anything like that. It was VERY bright. Maybe the mood at night is different. Anyways, the champagne was significantly more affordable than the champagne we were drinking at Rolf's a few hours prior so that was appreciated. All drink prices seemed reasonable and for a hot spot like this, I appreciated it. They had restrooms one floor before the rooftop and an elevator that brought you back down to Eataly. The food might be AMAZING but I wouldn't know because we didn't stay, just had one glass of champagne and we weren't feeling it so we left.

They're so intricate and the lights also added to a great ambiance. It was a little chilly indoors, but it's a rooftop that's enclosed so that was to be expected.I made a reservation several weeks in advance right before they were fully booked out for the holiday season. I heard the wait time being around an hour and 45 minutes, so reservations are highly recommended. We were seated right on time. Yes, the tables are pretty cramped but nothing it's NYC and that's expected of a popular holiday spot like this. Service was pretty good. We ordered both of the kinds of mulled wines and they were actually really delicious! The holiday cocktails looked pretty good too, but most consisted of bourbon or whiskey which I'm not big on so I passed.I also went in knowing I wasn't going to be blown away by the food since I frequently seek out top Italian spots, but it wasn't as bad as some people made it sound. We both ordered the gnocchi, which was in a delicious Gorgonzola sauce. The gnocchi itself was average, as expected, but it wasn't bad. The portion was good enough for me to not leave feeling overly stuffed, which happens a lot at Italian places. We also stuck around an additional hour or so just chatting at our table and none of the waiters bothered us which was really nice.

I told him I had a dairy allergy and he said he would check if the chicken dish could be made dairy free. He came back and said the butternut squash it came with is made in butter and there is no substitutions. For those prices of $24 for chicken, you wouldn't let me substitute another veggie OR EVEN MORE CONCERNING WHY CAN'T YOU COOK IT WITHOUT BUTTER? So, the food is pre-prepared.

My friend and I planned to grab one glass of wine to cap off a great last day, but as soon as we arrived, something was off. We arrived at the same time as another couple who were Italian and watched as both of our parties were ignored by a host with serious attitude and reindeer antlers on. Bizarre. We waited and waited and waited, until I finally got the host's attention while he was heavily immersed in a conversation complaining with coworkers about two feet away from us. It was clear that we were there and waiting. With an almost exasperated tone, he said to the lovely Italian couple, ""dinner or drinks?"" They didn't quite understand, so he asked again and again, looking at his coworkers, annoyed that they didn't speak English. Finally, one of the coworkers chimed in to help, and then it was our turn. He was equally short with us, and despite the dining room being dead, very abruptly relegated us to the bar. My friend and I were both caught off guard by how we were being treated, and as we reluctantly made our way to the bar, a couple leaving whispered to us, ""don't waste your time."" Talk about a damper on a good day. The bartenders were in a foul mood, and when we finally ordered glasses of wine, I was so distracted by the terrible atmosphere, I drank a mouthful of sediment. I told a manager about the brutal experience to which I essentially received shrugged shoulders. It's a lovely space that could have been a perfect end to a weekend filled with great food, drinks, and service, but it was a bit of a disaster.

When we got there, we had already received a message that our table would be ready soon so we made our way to the server to let her know we were here. We asked if would be okay to add another person- so a party of 4. It was no problem at all and we were seated within 5 mins of arriving.

The food was terrible and way over priced. $38 for pasta that wouldn't fill up a ten year old.

We had reservations at 11:30, and came in right when they opened (tell that story later) since check is downstairs, and if you're familiar with Eataly, it gets crowded. Loved the decor, and seeing the fresh herbs grown as soon as you get upstairs. Food was delicious. The portion sizes were perfect in our opinion - we're not big carb stuffers! Had a couple of raclette appetizers (you smell it as soon as you walk in), then half of us had the gnocchi, the other half the fried cauliflower. Both were delicious though I preferred the flavor of the cauliflower. It was topped with capers and chopped black olives....mmmm, I'll be dreaming of that for days!Our server was wonderful. Absolutely delightful. But that story about coming in, you ask? Well there's where I deduct one star. We came around 11:15. Just stood there, not expecting to be served, and didn't know yet you had to check in downstairs. There was no sign. But what we did walk into was a scrawny boy with his sunglasses on, sitting at the window sill looking as unprofessional as can be. He gave us attitude as soon as we stepped in, ""we don't open till 11:30."" I replied we know, we just don't like to be late. We stepped out of the room before I blew my top, then another group of people do the same thing. They got the same treatment except were notified to go downstairs for check in. So we all do that. The hostess was barely setting up, but had the same annoyed look as people started lining up behind the desk. Mind you, no one was charging at her. Just waiting patiently till they opened so we could check in for our reservations. She didn't let us up the elevators till exactly 11:30. So we're back upstairs, and that same scrawny guy is in the exact same position. Wow-thanks for making us young folks look bad with your horrible service. And you're open now, so shouldn't you start looking professional? Maybe 30 minutes into our meal, he starts actually working as a host. I don't know how this guy got his job because he couldn't even change faces. He looks annoyed as he walked his guests with nearly 10 yards separating them. Yes, he'd walk quickly and each of his guests are trying to move at his pace so they can see their table. What a jerk (and I never write reviews like this!). I hope management knows who I'm talking about. He made you lose a star!In conclusion, good food, great decor, good server who redeemed the place after our rough entrance.

The portions are way too small for the price and the presentation was disappointing. We ordered the Pane Otto as a starter and the bread was tough and hard to cut, as we expected fresh warm bread. The insalata di rucola was also very disappointing, basically just arugula with a little balsamic and maybe 4 tiny pieces of shaved Parmesan.

A lot of what happened was beyond his control, but overall I think they've still got some kinks to work out operationally. - Out server thought the first bottle we ordered was out of stock, which it was. He returned for us to reorder 15m later. He thought the second bottle we chose was out of stock (it also was) and informed us they were turning over many bottles. It was rather frustrating. He ultimately brought something that was good, in our price range, but that took about 30m in total, and then another 10 before he came back for our food order.

My boyfriend made a surprise reservation here for Saturday afternoon because of an article he saw. The article highlighted the picture perfect restaurant because of its seasonal decorations. I quickly understood why because it was like walking into a winter wonderland. The place had a rustic feel to it and Italian vibes left and right - it was the perfect photo op. We came at just the right time because from November 5-18, they were offering a prix fixe menu so to save some money, that's what we ordered from. There were three appetizers and three entrees to choose from for just $28 per person. We got the apple salad and the buffalo mozzarella as appetizers and for the entrees we got the pork sausage and the chicken.

3.0,11/14/2018,"Went here on a Tuesday night with a party of 5 (made a reservation by calling even though it said it was fully booked on open table). The decor was PHENOMENAL like this is a place I would take friends visiting NYC if they wanted somewhere beautiful and instagram worthy. However because it was so dark outside, pictures didn't come out well unfortunately.As for the food, my family and I did a mix of the restaurant deal at the time (2 courses for $28) and some dishes on the menu.Insalata di Mela- raddichio,fennel, apple salad (3/5): Not bad! I'm not a fan of raddichio because it made it very bitter but that's just my opinion. Otherwise fennel apple and mustard are always great combosBuffalo Mozzarella (3/5)- good mozzarella but it was very cold when I got it. Which sounds weird but I've been to restaurants downstairs in eataly and they always serve cheese room temp because that's when you taste the flavor the best. Mozzarella just came with salt and pepperZucca Arrostita (5/5)- honeynut squash filled with a hazelnut filling(?) this was so so delicious. Perfect fall flavors and the squash was very well cooked.Pollo con lettichie e cavolleti (2/5)- chicken with black lentils. I wasn't a huge fan of this. It was small portions of dry chicken and flavorless lentils. This may have been because it was the restaurant fest deal but otherwise i wouldn't get it againCavolfiore Fritto (4/5)- fried cauliflower. This was delicious!! The risotto sauce was the perfect accompaniment to the fried cauliflower. The capers it came with worked well with it but they provided a LOT on the plateProbusta con polenta (4/5)- sausage with Italian cornmeal. This was also very good! It came with one medium sized sausage, pickled cabbage, mustard, and this creamy cheese polenta. They provided a lot more polenta than protein (but it was delicious) Panna cotta (4/5)- delicious dessert. It was very sweet though Tiramisu (5/5)- usually not a fan of tiramisu but this one has more chocolate and coffee flavor! Really delicious Overall this was a BEAUTIFUL restaurant and would absolutely come back to see what it looks like in the daytime. However I thought the food was good, not outstanding in any way, and pretty pricey for the size and quality.

4.0,11/7/2018,"Solid four stars for Serra, which is pretty darn good for a touristy-type restaurant in the City. Went in last night with the family, including my baby girl. This location of Eataly is currently offering promotional menus at their restaurants for $18 and $28 so needless to say, the place was packed even on a random Tuesday night. After walking through the busy and LOUD downstairs area, I originally thought we might have to find someone else to go for dinner. However, I stopped and asked a host what he suggested... what restaurant he thought was best, where they could accommodate our party & baby,etc. He was lovely and so helpful in walking us over to the entrance to Serra. The hostess at Serra said there would be a 30 minute wait, but we could proceed upstairs. As soon as we got upstairs, we were so relieved that it was decibels quieter than the main floor. Whew! AND, even better, they took us to a table right away. As we had probably pushed baby girl a little too long between meals, this way certainly appreciated. After being seated, we were pretty quickly attended to by a water stewards, servers, and bread/food runners. We ordered a bottle of wine (also on special for $25 a bottle) and a number of appetizers and small plates to share-- the arugula salad, a meat platter, the mixed raclette plate, wagyu beef skewers, burrata with beets and polenta for baby girl. Though the food is not mind blowing, everything was tasty, and we especially loved the most simple dishes of arugula salad and the charcuterie plate. And the service was on point. We would certainly not hesitate to return next time we're in town.",2,0,2,Anne H.,"Chattanooga, TN",120,175,44

This was my third time here and it doesn't disappoint- we were seated quickly and attended to with consistently refreshed water, a lovely autumnal view, and fresh Italian fare. While it probably gets more hectic at peak dinner/lunch hours, it has a relaxed and welcoming vibe for locals and visitors alike. A few of the menu items we weren't familiar with, so we had to ask- ingredients we assumed were vegetables turned out to be beef.

Our cheese and meats came on two separate ginormous platters ....with nothing else on them. Afterwards the server brought out and unceremoniously dumped a small dish of jam ""it's for cheese"".

I choose a Sicilian dish, I know it well. The sauce lacked flavor and I must say I wouldn't have choose the type of pasta he did. I really had high expectations as it's really hard to mess up eggplant, pasta and a lite sauce. We were a table of 7 and waiting well over an hour for our meal which only added to my disappointment of the flavor being less than satisfactory. Typically I greatly dislike commercialized restaurants because they creat American style dishes and this place just proves my theory.

We took a little bit to walk around on the bottom level, eat something small, and snack. We then decided to go up to the top floor where Serra is located. We walked up to the bar to see if we could get a drink while we waited and a bartender came up to us to assist us. We were really excited to get a drink with cider and then pick if we wanted brandy or bourbon. My friend picked one of the bourbons and she was told they were out. So she thought about picking the other bourbon, but resorted to the brandy. The bartender said, ""I'm going to give you more time to marinate on that because you seem like you can't make a decision and you've made three different decisions in the past minute."" We thought he was joking. He wasn't and walked away. Then we decided to just wait on the couches for the remaining 45 minutes. After waiting forever, we were finally seated and so excited. We planned on getting drinks and desserts for all three of us. The waiter asked if we had questions and I asked for the dessert menu. He said that we had to order dinner because they were too busy right now to just serve drinks and desserts. We offered to buy appetizers too and he said that wouldn't work.

They have a customized fall menu with fall themes drinks. Each one better than the previous! I tried their local hot apple cider. Try it! It'll give you the proper fall feel making your transition from summer fall extremely pleasant and exciting. The ambiance it great and so is the service. You get a good service even at the bar.

I was here last night though with my mother and it was definitely the best menu I've seen from them and all the food we had was amazing! I would definitely recommend a visit for the food as well as the ambiance. The food is definitely a little pricey; but not abnormally high pricing for NYC. Also get a bottle of wine, it's a much better deal than their by the glass pricing.Service was definitely slow(we were there for over an hour before we got any food) and at times I felt our waiter was a little curt. Supposedly there was an issue in the kitchen which caused the delay although a part of me suspects our order just didn't get put in until well after we ordered since the kitchen mix up only looked to affect our table.The only other con is just how tightly packed in the tables along the wall are; each table is no more than 6 inches apart so it's borderline communal dining; my mother and I  hopped tables so we landed at the end of the row which was much nicer- that way we were only listening to one other conversation instead of conversations on both sides of us.",0,0,0,Caitlin D.,"New York, NY",170,106,108

I Honestly never thought I could revive customer service like this in NYC!!! Food came in VERY small portions and wasn't expecting the dishes to be as small as they were but Nichole pointed out some dishes/sides that'd complemented our food.

1.0,7/26/2018,"Genuinely one of the worst dining experiences I have ever had in NYC...and I've lived here 8.5 years! I went to Birreria for dinner with a girlfriend yesterday and actually contemplated asking for a refund! The food was inedible (Burrata had a terrible aftertaste and was served alone, with no bread or anything else), Meatballs were room temp and looked/tasted days old also served alone with no sauce. Pasta was undercooked (not al dente, but harder and chewy). We ordered three appetizers and 2 entrees. They brought out one app and an incorrect entree. I sent it back, then within minutes they brought the correct entree (which leads me to believe they precook the food and leave it sitting out until someone orders it). My friend's entree eventually arrived with the other two apps. After finishing our terrible meal, the waitstaff left our plates sit in front of us for no less than 25 minutes. They only cleared them after we asked for our check. After we left, we discovered that our waiter charged us both twice! Once for $40 and another time for $75 ($75 was the correct charge). Now I need to call the restaurant and dispute the $40 charge, which is just what I want to do because I have absolutely nothing better to do with my time. This is the third time I've been to this restaurant and it has gotten consistently worse over time. Such a shame as it has so much potential.

The chicken dish I ordered was microscopic - 5 tiny bite-sized pieces of chicken served with some olives and tomatoes - the most unassuming and flavorless Italian cuisine I've ever tried.

Keep in mind that these portions are pretty small. To be honest, I didn't think my dish was all that. It wasn't as flavorful and I was expecting more to it. I think my bf kinda enjoyed his but it wasn't something that was super fantastic. We both definitely expected something better out of this place and was kinda disappointed.

There's little point in making a reservation here, as we weren't seated until 45 mins after our 8pm reservation time (I admit, a friend of mine was a bit late, but we waited at least a half hour when she actually did arrive). We hung out at the overcrowded bar while we waited for our table. I had an aperol spritz, which was standard. When we finally were led to our table, we were told that we'd again have to wait another few minutes because another party ""took our table."" We were unclear what this meant at first, but quickly understood that another party took our original  table bc the table we were sat at had a huge, powerful fan blowing straight at it. I'm not one to complain about this stuff, but after our menus flew off the table and my eyes starting running from the wind, I asked our server what we could do. After being turned down twice, the manager finally came over and shut the thing off. No apology. Despite how unpleasant this was, the way this place is decorated is really lovely, so it's a shame the rest was such a bust. After ordering the cheese plate, charcuterie, and bread w lard, (and artichokes that never came), we decided to stop there. Not sure how you manage to make a standard cheese and meat plate bland, but it was accomplished. Despite the poor experience and underwhelming food, our waiter was lovely. Skip this spot.

The wine was expensive but good we had a Gavi or friulli I can't remember which. Food is small here and we had pesto fusilli the only pasta on the menu, lamb skewers, beef skewers, fried artichokes, and a bread basket. The artichokes were absolutely the best part but a super small portion for more than 2 to share. The pesto was our number two - the rest was not memorable at all. Service was ok.

They have a retractable roof which on a nice day would be great but unfortunately we were there on a rainy day. The service at the table was wonderful and food was pretty good. Definitely order the cocktail with the rosé popsicle. It was refreshing and amazing. One of the best cocktails I've had in a long time. Now the bad:It. Was. Hot. Not only was it a rainy day but it was a humid day. That retractable roof almost acts as a greenhouse roof and seals in all the heat and humidity. Just sitting at the bar we were dripping sweat. They have fans but they barely helped. The bartenders weren't friendly at all and acted like we were a bother. Mind you, this was 1:00 on a Friday in the summer = empty. When we sat down the waitress informed us that they were out of Burrata, out of one of the two pasta dishes on the menu, out of a 3rd item on the menu (I can't remember) and out of one of the frozen drinks they serve.

I also tried the Giardino cocktail which had a little kick to it, definitely recommend. The only issue I have is that we ordered the 5 cheese plate for $17 at the bar, waited 30 minutes only to find out that the waiter did not put our order in. After waiting for nothing, we decided to close out and leave. The waiter offered to put an order in when he found out he screwed up but we were already leaving.

It's a busy day and they want to turnover the table. I get it. However, even after spending over $150 on food where we were still constantly rushed by Jessica, we were just handed the check. We still had full drinks and food left. We hadn't even looked at the check, as we were still working on finishing our food when Jessica came back and tried to collect the check. We informed her we hadn't even looked at it yet. I thought spending $200 at least bought you some time to finish your food.

When we arrived our table was not ready so we got a drink at the bar. The bar was way too crowded and the space is not air conditioned. It was too crowded and too hot. They should really limit the amount of people heading to the rooftop. It was pointless to have a reservation because the table wasn't ready until 8:50. We had to wait 50 minutes for a table with a reservation! When we sat down, our table was facing this very aggressive fan. The menus were blowing and we were very uncomfortable. At first, the management had said we cannot shut the fan because it will be too hot. After speaking with them and expressing our unhappiness, they finally shut it off. The food was very underwhelming and disappointing. We ordered the bread with lard and it came with olive oil and butter. The presentation was horrible. Then we ordered 5 cheeses and 5 cured meats for 50 dollars       . I felt like I could have put together a nicer board myself for way less than 50 dollars.

This rooftop restaurant is very charming with a rustic theme and flowers hanging from the ceiling. Visually it's a very cute place, great spot for pictures! It's located in the rooftop at Eataly, right across from Madison square park so great location. Our server was very nice. So why the 2 stars? Where do I begin, our reservations were for 8pm, we didn't get seated until 8:45 due to our table not being ready. What's the point of taking reservations when you don't honer them. After asking several times about the table, we keep getting the same response that they were cleaning up. At no point was an apology given for the delay. Once the hostess walks us to the table we see that it is still being cleaned, apparently the group that was there moved to our table and we had to wait even more. We quickly discovered the reason why the party moved themselves. There was a ceiling fan blowing straight at us,  think of Beyonce's fan at a concert blowing straight at your face. My poor friend's eyes were burning and turning red from the hurricane like wind. We asked several people if they could  turn off the fan, after about 15 minutes of sitting there beyond uncomfortable the fan was turned off. We ordered the cheese plate and the charcuterie, and the bread with lard. There was no effort put into these plates,  just tiny pieces of tasteless cheese put on the board. Despite the delicious sound of bread with lard, that was also meh. We didn't even bother ordering more food because if you can't even get cheese right there's no point in risking more bland food. The decor is nice but they need to get it together! You can't have bad service,  bland food and a fan blowing in your eyes! Not a pleasant experience!",3,1,1,Elianny S.,"Astoria, NY",159,368,1449

We were seated at a table in full sun on a 95 degree day when there were other tables all around us that were shaded. The waiter offered no options or suggestions from the menu when we asked for assistance. He just pointed to the only pasta they had left for the day and said ""we're out of the other stuff."" They kept our water filled but never offered anything from the drink menu. For a bar, you would think that offering drinks would be in their best interest. Especially on a hot day. We ordered from the cheese and meat section for an appetizer but he offered no suggestions or descriptions of what we were ordering. He just stared blankly until I told him what I wanted. Once the waiter took our order, we didn't see him again until he brought the check. I don't mind paying $100 for 3 small plates of pasta and an appetizer if the service is good. But the service was exceptionally terrible. I tipped the guy 20% because I'm not a jerk but the poor service made the high prices seem like a slap in the face.

Prosciutto: for $9, I was expecting a few slices of meat, probably 3 max, but we got a whole board of prosciutto. I was shooked. It was totally worth it. Wagyu skewer: it was very tasty. But it was a tiny bit over done for me, because wagyu is suppose to be very tender and melts in your mouth. Meatball: good portion and tender. The flavor was very nice.

I guess the trip from the ground floor to the roof is an arduous one, because nothing they serve up there is comparable to the things they sell downstairs. Honestly, it was just like the Olive Garden on an off night. Except with way ruder service. The wait time was ridiculous. They quoted an hour, but it was closer to 2. And they never apologize or assure you that you haven't been forgotten. They just let you languish in a pile of angry people. My girlfriend, who is generally quite reasonable, became murderous and nearly unhinged, because we left a better restaurant on account of a longer wait. There was blood in her eyes and some on the corners of her mouth, mixed with froth and poison.And for those a-holes crowing about how lush and green it is in the restaurant...I mean, sure. It's full of green plastic plants. If plastic does it for you, then knock yourself out.The food is so utterly forgettable that even though we went there yesterday, I'm having a hard time remembering what we ordered. Here, I'll try. Fava bean puree: Meh. Beef skewers: Ok, but how can you mess that up? Salad with arugula and market vegetables: Gross. They use an anchovy vinaigrette that is all anchovy. Meatballs: Frozen, I'd wager. Gross. Pesto pasta: Definitely not fresh. Undercooked and dry. The wine was good and our actual server was, too! I forgot to say that as I was droning on and on about the terrible hosts. But overall, this feels like a tourist trap, and I'm ashamed to have fallen into it.

Understand that while it is advertised as a rooftop bar, it is enclosed & there is no view. It is also quite warm & very loud. First, I went to the loud, crowded bar to order a cocktail while waiting for a table. Tried to get the bartender's attention several times - eye contact, ""excuse me"" 3 times over almost 10 minutes. Finally, he looks at me & in an annoyed voice says ""what?"" I apologized & explained that since it is very loud & he didn't acknowledge me, I thought he hadn't heard me. Tone, attitude, everything - obnoxious & inappropriate. I finally get my overpriced $16 cocktail & it was terrible. The flavors didn't mesh & I tasted (& felt) no alcohol. The wait for a table was significantly longer than we were told. Finally seated but the sun was directly in my eyes. Kept adjusting my position until it moved. Two pieces of cold, hard, dry focaccia was placed on the table. No evoo, butter- nothing.Took a bite & decided it wasn't worth the calories! We both ordered a pasta dish. I am Italian. I cook. I understand the concept of al dente. This was RIDICULOUS. Completely raw to the point of seeing flour when you cut into it. Thankfully, the portion was paltry - 10 pieces of pasta. The sauce was bland, completely under seasoned & lacked any evidence of the eggplant that was alleged to have been in it. We also ordered the orange wine. Truly the worst wine I have ever been served in my life. Everything about it from the bouquet to flavor was disgusting.

Food wasn't good enough to put up with indifference a second time especially after an amazing experience elsewhere last night.To expand on the short review written on my phone: Great idea, poorly executed. We arrived on time for our reservation to be told our table wasn't ready and would be another 15 minutes. We were sent to a packed bar, where people were standing shoulder-to-shoulder. Once our table was ready, it took ages for our server to arrive. When asking about wheat in dishes, I was told to stay away from the bread and pasta dishes (helpful) and when I asked about the fried zucchini blossoms, which I assumed were breaded, I was told she didn't think they were. Aren't servers supposed to know their menus? After checking with the kitchen, she returned to tell me they were breaded.  So in place of that, I ordered the same potato dish my husband had, assuming the portions were small. We received two huge dishes. Why wasn't I advised of that? I would have picked something else. We had enough potatoes to feed three or four tables. I got one club soda--and would have ordered another, proper drink, but our server vanished. My husband's beer glass sat empty. Near the end of our meal, they started closing the roof up--I assumed it was raining. So when she finally came back (first time during the whole meal) and asked if my husband wanted another beer, I asked if it was raining--thinking that we might have coffee and dessert if it was. With an indifferent shrug and ""I don't know"", I asked for our check and we left. Food was fine but I have no intention of returning to Eataly's rooftop restaurant.

5.0,5/22/2018,"Outstanding food, drinks, and ambiance at this rooftop (covered! with fans and heat lamps, if needed) rustic Italian pop-up. Come to savor your food, linger in good company, and fall in love with Eataly all over again :)FOOD: My only regret is that my stomach could not hold more.- Starter (free) foccacia--usually I don't comment on house bread, but this was one of my favorite items at the table. Translucent with the gift of EVOO and so soft, we easily went through 3 rounds of this stuff!- Pane (whole wheat bread) made with house starter, served with EVOO, lardo (pure fatty goodness), and butter.  Crisp crust just shy of too hard with a moist, wholesome interior that paired so well with the olive oil. Arrived warm :). - Cheese sampler--yes. Our favorite were the Parmesan (what a glorious and underappreciated cheese) and the Bufarolo (a cousin of Taleggio with a creamy start, all of the tang, and none of the after burn/sting of Taleggio. Completely in love). Other cheese were excellent but not notable (medium-hard mild cheeses)- Fried green tomatoes--surprise hit at the table. Delicately breaded, packed with flavor, and all on top of a gorgeous green puree (pea/mint? Whatever, it was deliciouis). - Asparagus--executed well with generous amounts of olive oil and a medium amount of cheese. While tasty, this did not feel as special as the other items. The most interesting feature of this dish to all at the table was the chop pattern (diagonal into short, bite-sized segments)--we'll be replicating this at home to remove the screech factor of dinner knives on the plate. - Fusilli with fresh pesto--pasta was fresh and cooked perfectly al dente (I have found there is even a range within al dente, and I appreciated that this was on the softer side of al dente, allowing us to better appreciate the tenderness of the fresh pasta). I have never seen a noodle so perfectly coated in its sauce (what's their secret?). Smattering of pignoli over the top was artful and tasty! The olive oil left at the end excellent on the pane and the foccacia :). - Desserts did not appeal to us (tiramisu + fruit was too innovative for us), but luckily a quick journey to Eataly downstairs + Tiramisu della Nonna + Madison Square Park = perfect recipe to close out the night!DRINK:- Sangiovese--at $40/bottle, this was a steal and paired well with the meal. - Frosé--rosé/vodka popsicle served in a glass of sparkling wine ($15)--this is culinary and mixology innovation! The popsicle was so fun and well executed (delicate, citrusy flavor complemented the rosé)--all the fun of childhood for grownups. Awesome dessert option!SERVICE: Nick was attentive and humorous. We appreciated his empathy when a member of our party feared she could not drink while on her course of antibiotics (happily some manufacturer site research revealed this to be a myth) and menu/portion recommendations (prevented us from over-ordering). Reservation: Loved the text notification when it was time to go up. We waited for 30m (no reservation) after a 6pm walk up, which I considered an absurdly wonderful gift. You should pay a visit before word gets out! Bar: No reservation required (you can take the elevator up to 14) and you can order off the menu! Only issue was service--it was woefully understaffed ~8:30pm (1 bar tender; 30 thirsty humans). Some staff arrived in time to help before too many people got antsy, but this was a gap in an otherwise perfect experience. AMBIANCE: Enchanting is the only word I have--the delicate lights strung from the clear ceiling, the lush (fake, so don't look too closely) hanging plants, the rustic plant prints framed on the wall... it felt like a fairy tale I didn't want to end. Lovely place to catch up with friends or take a date! I'm surprised the other pop-ups are rated so lowly on Yelp--Serra is a treasure!",2,0,1,Helen W.,"San Francisco, CA",354,166,122

2.0,5/6/2018,"Interesting experience. We went to the restaurant specifically because it is advertised as ""roof-top"". It is rooftop all right, but there is no view really of any kind - a little bit of the building In front, and that's all - if you are hoping for a nice view of the city, this is no the place. Good beer and very good wine list, good number of wines at $50-$60 - we had an orange Trebbiano wine called Rhesan, and it was very good ($50). The service was really indifferent. We were told that we need to place the whole order at once and the waiter can't add anything later on. The charcuterie board arrived without any explanations regarding meat and cheese, and it was served literally without bread (tiny piece arrived for 4 people to share). The burrata was served just by itself with some olive oil, no salad or anything else with it - and Trader Joe's sells better tasting burrata than what was served. The only plus was deep fried artichokes. Overall, really lacking the service.  No view and food leaves much to be desired. Not recommended.",2,0,0,Anatoli L.,"Stamford, CT",100,341,374
4.0,5/4/2018,"This was my first time attempting the rooftop at Eataly during spring/summer weather. Generally speaking, Eataly is a huge tourist trap with hordes of people milling about that tend to ruin the experience of shopping or dining in there. Today wasn't exactly an exception but we decided press forward anyway because it was nice out.Once you're seated it's actually quite pleasant. The ceiling is beautifully decorated with plants and lights that weaved through out. The music is set at just the right volume so that it isn't drowning out your conversation and it isn't unbearably loud even when the dining area is full. As for the food, the menu has a lot of seasonal, healthy garden/farm to table options and the cocktail menu is interesting. It's not the cheapest place and the portions are on the smaller side, but I'm sure people know that already and it makes up for it by delivering quality food. For drinks, I went with the Sole Italiano-- very balanced drink that's refreshing on a warm spring/summer day. Not too sweet or too bitter. There are also some frozen drink options that I'll try when I come back at some point. For food I wanted to keep it light, so I went with the Pork and Veal Meatballs (POLPETTINE ALLA GENOVESE) which were much better than I thought they would be. It was highly recommended from the waitress. It was filling without being heavy and just the right portion. So to sum up, the best way to guarantee a good experience here is to make a reservation for a table or to come here at an off peak time. It's as simple as that. You can't just wander in between 5:30-7 and not expect a large crowd. What will happen is that you'll be standing in a very narrow bar area trying and most likely failing to get the bartender's attention while being constantly pushed and shoved by people coming and going.

3.0,4/27/2018,"Perhaps I'm just not the type of person who is going to love Eataly, apart from the occasional Nutella pastry or gelato. Fiancée and I came here the other night (Wednesday) with reservations. We were early, and seated right away. First off, it is LOUD. Like, can't hear your partner, waiter, or yourself think level of volume. There's no carpeting or anything and it's all enclosed so yeah. No intimate conversations here, folks. It also made ordering awkward. We came on a night where they had a special distiller event, and were offered samples of the three special cocktails they had that night, all made with the distiller's absinthe. The cocktails being priced at $8/ea also made it a nice incentive to order from the specials, as most others started in the upper teens. I had one made with red absinthe and it was very well made and enjoyable. The food was really good for the most part. We had the wagyu beef skewers, fried zucchini blossoms, Otto bread, prosciutto, vegetable tray, and the cheese flight. Overall my favorite were the fried zucchini blossoms. A lot of the cheese served on the tasting was very mild (only one hard cheese, and it was subdued) and there was a ricotta on it as well which I thought was... odd. The thing about it was if we hadn't ordered the bread, we would have had no other way to eat it as the cheese was only served with a small portion of fig compote. The prosciutto lacked the salty flavor I associate with the meat and was more of a fatty/rich taste. Different than expected, but, I did end up buying more downstairs. The wagyu skewers were good but small- though it would be a crime to screw up this beef in my opinion. Some reference of size of items would have helped on the menu (there were two skewers of 3 small pieces each) The vegetable tray was okay- perhaps ordered a little early in the season for good options? The zucchini blossoms I'd order again in a heartbeat, but those were really the only stand out ""wow"" bites I had here. So. Loud. Eataly prices. Good food (some not great though) and crowded.

It was literally four shrimp on two skewers that tasted like they had lemon squeezed on them. That's it... For entrees I got the Fusilli alla Scoglio, which was described as ""Local Squid, Gulf Shrimp, Little Neck Clams, Tomato & White Wine."" There was one small piece of squid tentacles, 4 pieces of shrimp, which was one tail that was butterflied and cut into four pieces, and two small clams. I left hungry, when I wasn't that hungry to begin with.My girlfriend got the Insulata Di Rucola, aka a pile of arugula with some shaved cheese and dressing.... $15.

2.0,9/26/2017,"One of the few times I didn't look up reviews beforehand, and one of the few times I tipped less than 15% at a restaurant for a good reason.  We came mid afternoon on a Saturday mostly for drinks, but I had the pricey Octopus / Peach / Arugula Salad (pretty and pretty yummy, but again, pretty pricey as wel)l.  What I didn't like was the waiter clearly acting disappointed we didn't order more food.  At $16 a pop for drinks, I think he ciould've learned to contain his displeasure a bit better.  He also forgot a drink order (we were charged for it anyway - removed after I asked), never came back to check on us ONCE after our order, and I had to stop another waiter to ask for water refills on a very hot day. There are TONS of waitstaff and the rooftop was not busy, so the very lacklustre, apathetic service for such an expensive menu was inexcusable.  He only dripped feigned hospitality right before he gave us the bill.  Really, really not worth it unless you have a thing for being ignored.  Cute decor.  That's about it.",0,1,0,Steph C.,"Houston, TX",274,198,218

I made a res on Open Table for 4 even though we were 4 adults and my toddler (they didn't have a res for 5 available). They were very accommodating and gave us one of the 6-top cabanas in the back. Our waitress was nice enough but service was slow. She said the kitchen preferred if we placed our entire order at once rather than putting in our bruschetta order first, which seemed silly to us, but fine. We ordered a shared bottle of the cucumber Spritz and it was delicious. My friend ordered the peach, which she figured for $8 would be a special preparation. Nope, just a peach cut into chunks and put on skewers. And not even a whole peach. And it wasn't even a good peach! We sent it back. The bruschetta was good, as was the bread we requested for the table (not brought automatically as it used to be). My eggplant was delicious but at $25 seemed overpriced. My husband enjoyed the Branzino and thought it was better than the ones he'd had at other restaurants recently. My friend's pasta dish was good but very small. The fior de latte gelato was soupy so we just had two scoops of the chocolate, which was fabulous. It was just a hit or miss meal. The ambiance is great. The drinks are great.

3.0,9/24/2017,"Seated immediately on a Sunday night, which was a surprise. Upon first glance, I fully loved the ambiance here; they've made it beach-themed, but I doubt it's always like that. It's very fun, colorful, and classy, yet I didn't feel out of place going in leggings and a crop top. They know they're very popular, but they're humble about it. Our waitress, Sherry, was a doll. Read the specials to us, and the kale salad appealed to me, so we split it for an app. I ordered the swordfish and friend ordered the branzino. I liked my swordfish (and the small portion size, as I wasn't that hungry, but if I were, I wouldn't have been satisfied), and also tried the branzino (duh) and liked it, too. Seemed like pretty standard meals. I guess I'm giving Birreria three stars, because nothing really blew me away. It was forgettable. I could get the same for cheaper elsewhere.

The meats and cheeses were good (but that's not rocket science). Bruschetta arrangements were fine, bit incredibly tasty or unique. I was with three others and they all wanted steak. The waitress suggested that they order the 32 oz ribeye (that wasn't on the menu) for $110 instead of the 8 oz each for $33. They said that made sense. She came back saying they ran out of the 32 oz ribeye but they did have a 39-40 oz they could have for more money (obviously :/ ). To make a long story short, the medium rare steak came out way to medium well. Awful.

3.0,9/8/2017,"Don't get me wrong- there are a lot of good qualities about Sabbia but also a lot of bad qualities; hence, the 3-star rating.I went on a Friday at 5. The ambience was nice as the atmosphere is light and airy. The decor is a little tacky but cute: think Outback Steakhouse but with repurposed objects that you would find in a small Italian seaside town. Problem- the place there is a lot of tourist-hype so it is extremely packed and loud. Even if you manage to find a table (think 20-30 wait) there's the sense that people are watching waiting and listening to you for the slightest sign that you may soon be leaving, thus making your table available.Then there's the price. You can find 3-5 varieties of wine for under $40 but average is from $80-90 range. The regular menu seemed way overpriced: not expensive but overpriced. We decided to order the oysters. They tasted gritty and metallic and were about $3 each (this was at happy hour time where you can find good quality $1 oysters in Flatiron). The shallot vinaigrette was nothing to write home about. Even the ice melted with 20-30 minutes and it was only 70 degrees (20c) and windy. Since they did not enjoy the oysters about half of our order of 18 oysters were drowned in cold water. Lastly, the service. It was fast but the server gave us a too cool for school attitude. He always looked angry but he was kind of sexy-angry. Thus, we named him ""hate-fucker."" I asked hate-fucker if he thought a table would open up soon (after waiting about 20 minutes)- as not to pester the guests enjoying their drinks. He rolled his eyes and said ""not likely."" Three minutes later... he sends two girls who just strolled in to a table where the patrons were about to leave and so I had to spend about 15-20 minutes, with a thumb up my ass because there's no room to wait for a table, until a new one opened up. Hate-fucker was still very attentive so we gave him a 20% tip. Would I go back? Yes but not frequently and only on a weeknight after 9pm.",0,1,0,Davood S.,"New York, NY",2,5,4

One of the workers who served us bread and refilled our water was also very friendly, attentive and patient. We ordered the Puglia and Campania Bruschettes and Paccherri pasta.

3.0,9/4/2017,"My friend & I went on a Friday night around 8:00pm. Entrance was within Eataly, and you have to take an elevator to their rooftop bar floor. Ambience was pretty & hip, although there were so many people it did get kind of loud. This is a casual place just with fancy prices, so if you want a nice one-on-one speaking to someone location, this isn't the best... unless you don't mind speaking very loudly. The food was tasty, but not so tasty that the price was worth it. The appetizers and main dishes are not cheap here. The most affordable pasta was $18.00 and it didn't seem so big. I got a Granchio fritto from the appetizer menu & it was very small. For an appetizer costing $22.00, I expected a bit more, but that might be the American talking in me. A Fagioli & Tonno dish was $20.00 (give or take, don't remember) and it really did not have much content. The slices of tuna did not look appetizing, my friend didn't really enjoy the dish, because it was mostly beans. Meanwhile, on the menu it had said quinoa & other things.

She and I visit many restaurants together back home, so we wanted to check out some of the best NYC had to offer.When first walking up to the rooftop restaurant, we were very impressed by the decor and the overall ambiance. It truly makes you feel like you are sitting on a terrace in Italy, it was beautiful. We ordered a few things off the menu (three cheese platter, Watermelon-Cucumber Salad, Arugula Salad, and bread). However, when the food arrived we were pretty taken aback by the serving size per plate. I really should have taken pictures of our food, because we were shocked by the amount of food you received at the the price of the meal. The three ""blocks"" of cheese brought out to us were incredibly small. Honestly, we thought it was the amount of cheese you would put on a ""mouse trap""-- it was that tiny. We really couldn't tell the difference between the three cheeses, so we really aren't sure if they were different cheeses at all. The Watermelon-Cucumber salad was missing ingredients stated on the menu (Basil & Cilantro). The dish was basically sliced watermelon, two pieces of cucumber, and queso fresco. Definitely not a salad. The Arugula Salad, albeit very simple, was not worth the cost. We explained to our server that the Watermelon-Cucumber salad was very disappointing, and honestly very misleading. She was very apologetic, extremely helpful, and even offered to bring a new dish of choice. We thought this was a very nice gesture from the staff. We instead ordered Shrimp Skewers, but were once again shocked by the amount of food, and the quality was lacking. We decided that we were pretty much over it, and decided to just pay & leave.

Long story short: the service is average at best, it is so loud you can hardly hear the person next to you, the views are nonexistent, and the food is overpriced and under-portioned. When I went to Sabbia, it was raining so the roof was closed. This would have been fine if it was not 200 degrees inside the restaurant. They only have a few fans placed around the restaurant so you would get a little breeze every once in a while, but not often enough to be a comfortable temperature. It also took the hostesses a weirdly long time to seat us even though our whole party was there and there were a ton of empty tables.The drinks were good - no one had anything bad to say - but they were overpriced.We ordered a lot of appetizers because nothing really sounded great as far as the entrees go. So we got a bunch of cheese, the anchovies bruchetta, meats, bread (they provide this with the meal), and some oysters.

All he wanted to do was prove how smart he was and how he was right and it did not land - that's not what a dining experience should be. For example: asking about rose - I said I want dry, light in color - ""but what flavor do you want?!"" I just said dry. ""But that's not the flavor."" This went on - the back and forth. Why not just guide me instead of making me feel like an idiot? Then, we ordered a branzino whole fish, that they refused to filet because they don't do that. I'm sorry - most restaurants offer this for you, which he said most don't and also because the menu was clear. The menu wasn't clear. It does not state, we do not filet here. Sorry. And the fact that he had to argue that with me? Gross. He made the meal unpleasant, but not ruined because I won't let his attitude ruin a good meal.

Downstairs, the host was rude about letting us get to the elevator and insisted we wait in line to ensure we had a reservation before going up to the real hostess stand. Annoying, because I had the reservation on my phone as we walked in. When we got upstairs, something was seriously wrong the the air-flow, it was hellishly hot and humid (but it wasn't even this warm outside so...that was an issue) and all of the fans they had on were faced at the employees rather than the guest tables, and only some of them were turned on. It must have been 90 degrees in there despite it being 80 outside. So to beat the heat my sister and I started with the frosé which was so delicious and refreshing! I started with the arugula salad which was lovely on its own, though the option to add chicken would have been great. Next I had the paccheri pasta - large rigatoni-like pasta with fresh roasted cherry tomato, chile, & basil. The pasta flavor was great and SO fresh tasting that I wanted to love it, if not for it being so unbelievably undercooked. This was no al dente, but true gets-stuck-in-your-teeth almost crunchy undercooked. I looked to my sister in law who also ordered it....same issue. At this point we had suffered enough so we ate half and got out of there before we had a heat stroke, but normally I would have sent it back. Come to find out a few weeks later - one of my friends had the same experience and both she and her mom sent theirs back. Gosh, definitely err on the side of slightly overdone than crunchy, my friends. Everyone else enjoyed their meals, mostly salads and panini, and didn't have any similar issues.

3.0,8/10/2017,"Sabbia is the summer pop-up restaurant at La Birreria, the rooftop beer garden atop Italian food mecca Eataly. In other words, it's an establishment inside of an establishment on top of an establishment, which at the end of the day, is all the same establishment. Hence why I could use my $200 Eataly gift card here, and it being an pricey tourist hot spot, also why I spent entire said gift card, without even trying, on a lovely Saturday lunch and drinks for two.But before we get into what that bought me exactly, allow me to set the stage. Yes, all things Eataly are bound to attract out-of-towners, but New Yorkers aren't immune from rootfop fever and love to flock to haute high altitudes come summertime. However, Sabbia is a rooftop bar without much of a view. Striped, white and yellow awnings hang overhead, which justifiably block diners from the sweltering sun, but also block any kind of skyline vistas in the process.In terms of decor, Sabbia (meaning ""sand"" in Italian) seeks to embody the look and feel of the Old Country's seaside resort towns. Having been to the Amalfi Coast years ago, I can vouch for it being just Epcot-y enough to pass in terms of style and motif, with those aforementioned, on-trend awnings and kitschy signs that say ""Spiaggia Naturista"" and such. But that's where the fantasy stops. Despite its lack of views, you are still on top of a tall building in Manhattan, and sadly not sipping spritzes on the beach.That said, if anything, the food comes closest to transporting you to Southern Italy, as it most definitely should. Here's what we tasted, ranging from Mmm to Meh:Piadina Crudo (DOK Dall'Ava Prosciutto San Daniele & Stracchino, served with Arugula Salad) - Thin, pressed flatbread paired with high quality cuts of meat and cheese, while simple in concept, made for a near-perfect summer sandwich. How I wish this was available at my local Italian deli and not on the 14th floor of Flatiron real estate.Panzanella di Anguria (Watermelon, Housemade Rustico, Cucumber, Mint, Basil & Ricotta Salata) - This was a special when we visited, but a quick check of the menu online suggests this one's been upgraded to regular status. And rightfully so. The ingredients were incredibly fresh and the mix of fruit and big-ass bread chunks hit the spot. This coming from a guy who admittedly couldn't care for watermelon normally.Crispy Potatoes - A self-explanatory side, served with some confusion. We had an allergy at the table and apparently they are cooked in some crustacean-tainted oil, so we opted to pass. Then they were brought out anyway, but the runner told my wife not to eat them. We again said, ""no thanks"". Then, apparently not admitting defeat, they came back to give us boiled potatoes instead, which we were told were safe for both of us to eat, and which we were honestly still pretty damn good. I imagine the crispy kinds are even better.Birreria Flight (Four 4 oz. beers) - Half Italian brews (Birra Del Borgo Enkir and Baladin Nora), half Dogfish Head (SeaQuench and Romantic Chemistry), given their corporate partnership with Eataly, the range of flavors was fairly narrow, and while refreshing, there were no real favorites to come out of the tasting.Polpo Alla Piastra (Seared Octopus with Chickpea, Almonds, Marinated Peppers & Taggiasca Olives) - Maybe I'm just over our eight-legged friend, but this one was a bit unmemorable (but by no mean inedible).Margarita - Meh mostly because I didn't order it. I asked for a Beer-arita (not the Bud Light variety, but Sabbia's special blend of Dogfish Head Namaste, Espolón Reposado, Luxardo Triple Sec, Lime & Honey, with a Chili Rim). And while at first, I thought it was just heavy tequila, light on beer, I quickly realized there was no beer in my drink at all. Womp.You'll have to hop a plane to summer and celebrate Ferragosto the way Italians do, but Sabbia is still worth a quick subway ride for good food al fresco. Of course, having an Eataly gift card helps. Having one with $200 on it is even better.",0,0,0,Dan R.,"Brooklyn, NY",633,551,148

1.0,8/1/2017,"I would give anything to give 0 stars.Some of the worst customer service I've experienced in my entire life. I wish I were exaggerating, but not even close. Having worked in nearly every position of the restaurant business (hostess, server, bartender, runner, etc.) and having lived in the tri-state area for 30+ years I thought I'd experienced it all. This restaurant is unforgiving and unworkable - having arrived early to my 7pm reservation starving and ready to sit and enjoy a beverage with 3/4 of my reserved party they refused to seat us. Having faced the 'your whole party must be present to be seated' rule an innumerable number of times in my dining life I was ready for them (beyond it being a rule I've NEVER understood. People who sit order and eat... therefore your revenue is higher- therefore your business is better... therefore your clientele is happier, etc. etc.)... I stated numerous times that I would order for the whole table- I would order 4 person's worth of food or they could kick me out. Yet, the manager insisted they wouldn't seat me and that all orders had to be placed at once (even though I reiterated over and over and over again that they WOULD be). I have eaten at some of the finest restaurants in New York... nay, the World,  and I assure you- they let you order whatever you want- whenever you want- yet, Sabbia would only let us order upon seating. So out of exhaustion, we decided to wait at the bar for our 4th party- whom we also informed the front desk would only be joining us for dessert in the first place.  There, we placed our orders for drinks... only 1/3 drink orders were even available ($15 drinks) of course 2 of our desired kegs were tapped and unavailable (at 7pm on a Tuesday).Finally, our 4th party showed and we were seated.... and starving. Immediately upon sitting I asked to place an order for a cheese plate- yet the waiter refused to take my order... further, incomprehensibly insisting that all orders had to be placed at once for the kitchen. I asked the question as to whether, 'what if I remained hungry after ordering and wanted to order more?' I was answered by the waiter- 'We only take orders at once and if you order during the meal it will take an additional hour for your extra courses' At this point , at a total loss for any hope, understanding, or CUSTOMER SERVICE, we proceeded with our order. Mozzarella-bland, focaccia- greasy and not worth the money, the 3 cheese plate- a disgusting rip-off, the arugula salad-decent, and the 5 course bruschetta taster. One of the bruachetta toppings was stone fruit- something my good friend at the table is DEATHLY allergic to- I asked-'may we please replace this with a different bruachetta as she's so allergic'.... having known the answer of. 'NO' before I even finished asking I started laughing. No, even though my friend was deathly allergic- the kitchen and the CHEF refused to replace that ONE particular bruachetta with another. INCOMPREHENSIBLE. I am insulted, appalled, and have never been as upset about a dining experience as wretched, unforgiving, inhospitable, and quite frankly in the end, unenjoyable/un appetizing in my life. Beginning to end this restaurant made everything as difficult, unpleasant, unhelpful as possible. I am beyond passionate about client/customer service-  whether you be a tourist destination or not- people should be treated with respect and care and tonight we were treated like garbage.

The tables are packed in there and it was crowded and lively. The food was nothing special. We got the arugula salad w balsamic and parmesan cheese -- extremely over-salted. The artichoke bruschetta was good but nothing special. The paccheri pasta was the best we had, nice & al dente with a yummy buttery sauce. This I would get again. The eggplant parm was small and plain. We also got the Rose flight which was fun but the darkest of the four tasted like it had been open & sitting for awhile.

For cocktails, we ordered the Salty Bloodhound & Calabrese Sunrise, and they were okay... not too memorable. Honestly, it's a great place to just drink & talk because you want a good pic-worthy rooftop to hang out on during the summer, but if you're looking for exquisite, well-crafted cocktails, this really isn't the place for you.

We couldn't even enjoy our food & drinks as my group of friends wiped sweat from their foreheads trying to position themselves under the couple of fans they had going which did little more than push the hot air around. We finally left because it was unbearably hot up there. We wanted to stay and order more because our beer and apps were fantastic. Sea quench by Dogfish Head was on tap (one of my favorites) and we started with two bruschettas from the ""Bruschetta Bar"" up there.

3.0,7/18/2017,"I never knew that there was a restaurant on the rooftop of Eataly so this was a cool find. While I really enjoyed the decor and thought the food was decent, the service and expensive pricing was not to my liking. However, given the prime location and the fact that there is seafood on the menu, the prices are somewhat understandable.Upon arriving at Sabbia, the front desk had a lovely bouquet of colorful flowers on top and there was a wall with Sabbia spelled out in neon turqouise, as well as beach balls all over the wall leading to the outdoor bar and restaurant. The space was fairly large with many little tables and huge beach umbrellas to provide shade. The place had a beachy feel and casual atmosphere. We were seated without having to wait and were given complimentary bread in a brown paper bag, which was pretty tasty.I shared the Fritto Misto alla Ligure, which consisted of assorted fried seafood lingurian style, which was a good thing because it cost $26. It wasn't huge, but since I wasn't super hungry, it was enough for the 2 of us. The dish included calamari, white fish and shrimp. There was no accompanying sauce with it and to the food's credit, it actually didn't need sauce. My friend and I added some lemon to the dish and that helped bring out the flavors. It was delicious, especially the shrimp and calamari. Everything was fried to perfection with incredibly crispy batter and was well seasoned. The waiter got one of our orders wrong and was not attentive. Throughout the time we were there, whenever we needed the waiter/waved him over, we were pretty much ignored, including when we wanted to ask for the bill. The hostess was very sweet though.

If you're looking for a drink with a cool atmosphere, definitely go here. The food was just okay. We got the quail legs and wagyu steak. It was the most expensive just okay steak I've had in a while. The food was underwhelming. I'm a big food lover and I even had a hard time finding something on the menu that I really wanted to try. Seemed like a limited menu that was kinda out there.

No real views of anything though, unless you want to look at the back of other buildings.There were a few problems with them being short-staffed, and their slushy machine breaking, but I'll chalk that up to the event and not the venue.One thing I can blame them for was their bathroom light was completely off, and there was no clear light switch.

We were three people so we got three vouchers. this Saturday I made an 8PM Open Table reservation with the intention of using them only to be told by our waiter that we could only use two at a time for the table as the manager only allows 1 per table but he was making an exception. NOWHERE on these vouchers it says that only 1 per table is allowed. I didn't want to make a scene as we were having a special occasion dinner, however I find this type of behavior unacceptable. also, it's 6 oysters, how difficult can it be?? On top of this appalling behavior, we had to wait 35 minutes to be seated, (we did show up in time for our reservation and checked in TWICE), and let me tell you about one of the specials, ""grilled peaches with a glaze"". it consisted of two 4 inches long skewers with literally one slice of peach on each one, and it was served cold for $9.

No apologies, and the only explanation she gave was that the restaurant was hosting a private event and she was told no customers were allowed up after 10:30.

Even when the table next to ours left, instead of pushing it over to make adequate room for us, they just sat another couple down! One of my friends is a vegetarian and asked if she could get the bruschette sample platter to be just the vegetarian ones. Apparently the answer here is ""No, because the chef doesn't want to"".

First off, the bar is always packed--like just ALWAYS. PACKED. Reserve a table if you don't feel like fighting for space at the bar, as if you were in some commonplace, dingy pub. Secondly, the service here is quite slow. We put in our order for some meat & cheese, focaccia, and drinks, letting the server know that we would order more if we needed--he seemed disappointed. The Focaccia was two measly slices for $5, and it wasn't even warm--hard pass. The meat & cheese were all delicious, but would have been better with drinks. Why did we not have drinks? Because our drinks came longgg after all of the food was gone, and we were sitting there for quite some time. Even if we had wanted to order more food, the thought of waiting even longer dissipated that hunger quickly. Our server was nowhere to be found most of the time, and we needed to hunt down a manager to get us our check.

I didn't eat here as the menu didn't look too vegan friendly, but dishes ranged from cheeses (duh), cured meats and fresh seafood.  I think the prices were on par for the location/scene.  You're really paying for this atmosphere and the fact that you're at Mario Batali establishment.

2.0,5/15/2017,"So, we go to Eataly on a Friday night thinking we're going to have an enchanting evening of exotic Italian wine and cheeses. Something out of the ordinary. I was told the place has some of the best selection of everything Italian. Great! Except when we get to the place, the front door had a bouncer. Unfortunately there was a private event going on that night. So he said the rooftop restaurant was open and directed us up. Once up there, the place was pretty packed. We found a spot at the bar while we waited for our table. We got some house pinot grigio and moscato which tasted terrible. It tasted like it was from a $6.00 giant bottle of wine. The bartender tried explaining to me that my pinot grigio was a pinkish color because the way they made it. idk about all that. So we get our table, which was legit smushed right between two other tables. So small and so close, you could hear their entire conversations with total ease and vice versa. We ordered the meat and cheeses and was shocked to see what was brought out. The cheese was tiny for the cost, like comical tiny. I would say it was the size of two fingernails. I couldn't believe any kind of restaurant would serve that. Why not just charge more for a fair portion than overcharge and give nothing? The rest of the dinner was good except the dessert which was another joke. Go with the Tiramisu because the first option we picked (chocolate creme brulee) we had to send back. Was that bad.

Its just a trap!!!  And the joke is on you, pathetic diners who trust in a TV ""chef""!The shrimp with olive oil, garlic, parsley & oregano.... Eataly manages to make this common dish available pretty much anywhere.. not fit for a commoner or junkie.  our shrimp came (4 baby shrimp in total), each on a wooden skewer on a plain plate.  Could not see any oregano, parsley.. and we had to add salt and pepper to it for seasoning.  Batali is pathetic for passing this off as his cuisine!  He's not getting fat off this shrimp for sure -- unless you count his wallet!The $25 Eggplant Melanza was even worse!  Described as ""fried eggplant, with cheese and roasted cherry tomatoes""... technically this was correct.  There was a baby eggplant, sliced in half (so think about a 1.5"" thick eggplant wedge, with skin on half the side), sautéed in some olive oil to get it oily and chewy (but making sure not make it crispy or not icky), topped with white cheese and a few blistered tomatoes.  If this was a $7 item at Olive Garden -- you would STILL be disappointed.  I've been to Italy and this slop isn't served there. Crostinos were pretty disappointing.  the toppings were fine (although if you look around you will see the same toppings recycled on many different dishes.... entrees, appetizers, crostinos... can't give an A for effort here)... but the crostinos themselves were super stale.  Mind you, this is a restaurant with a GROCERY downstairs.  You may be better off bringing your own Triscuits  It would be an improvement.  Sausage with broccoli rabe was ok.  the sausage was good/simple.  the broccoli rabe came out as a lemon pesto on top of a sausage, which was weird, and not spectacular.  But it wasn't bad, and thus it was the star of the night!",0,0,0,Christopher E.,"New York, NY",0,151,0

They are currently rebranding the Birreria as Baita (maybe to somehow avoid all the other poor reviews) and so many things were not even available on the menu (including the raclette!).Service: pretty poor, they messed up our orders a couple times, still charged us for everything and then had attitude when we asked for the extra charged items to be removed. We bought a cake FROM eataly for the very purpose of celebrating a birthday with some dessert. We got charged an extra $35 for literally buying the cake FROM EATALY...This is an Eataly restaurant, so the stinginess with that type of thing was really poor.Food: considering this is an Italian restaurant, they should really have gotten some basis right. My pork shoulder was just all right, nothing special, definitely not worth 30 dollars. The kale and beet salad was 95% kale, so they skimped on any other ingredients. The cheeses and meats were good though.

1.0,4/18/2017,"This place used to be better.  It's got a great atmosphere on the rooftop but then you are met with horrible service and extreme attitudes.  I recently went here for dinner with friends and was told I had to wait for the rest of the party before being seated (not unusual) but the restaurant was empty! Most places would allow you to be seated if almost every table is open! We opted to be seated at a smaller table since the bar area was too crowded to order food and I was told that I would have to wait for the rest of the party to order food or I would have to close my tab, move to another table to accomodate for extra guests, and then start a whole new tab! This was not my first time eating here and I haven't experienced this behavior before otherwise I would not have returned.  I have never heard of this policy anywhere else in NY and the hostess, host, and 2 wait staff tried to claim this was their policy and it's not uncommon in NY.  I was hungry and decided to order agreeing to their ridiculous ""policy"".  I have policy in quotes because though we were asked to move to the next 2 tables once my other guests arrived (instead of moving 1 of the smaller tables to our table) they never closed out my check and had no issues with continuing to order multiple dishes on the current check.  During the entire service the staff were rude, slow, and creepy! One of the men bussing tables stood over our party for literally 10 seconds just staring at us without picking anything up.  The 2nd server brought us the check without asking and before we received our dessert! The food is ok but nothing great especially since there are tastier options downstairs.  Overall I won't return to this place.  We usually tip very well and decided to leave a tip that was deserving of the horrendous service we received to which the waiter demanded an explanation and more money.  We told him why and one of my friends heard him mutter under his breath ""f*** you"" as he turned away.  Having been in the service industry in the past I know it doesn't take a lot to be polite and good tips are earned and not guaranteed.  Everyone can have a bad day but the entire establishment couldn't possibly be having a bad day.  If you don't like what you do then you should find a different job.",0,0,0,Joyce K.,"Rutherford, NJ",18,53,10

Another half hour later at 7pm I talked to the manager who told me the person at the desk never should have taken our reservation, and the hotel concierge said it was just for drinks.

Our server was very inattentive, stopping by only 3 times our entire visit. The manager on duty ended up taking over since our server was apparently dealing with a ""talkative"" table and clearly overwhelmed. It took 25 minutes before any one even came over to greet us. Once we ordered waters, a bottle of wine and other drinks and apps, it took 45 minutes before we had to check in on where our items were. It's as if they weren't even entered to the kitchen/bar. After clearly stating our concern for the length of time it took, the manager gifted us with an extra appetizer. He stopped by once more to check on us, but that was it. Very friendly and nice guy, no complaints on that. It took another 35 minutes to track someone down to get our check and although the manager was kind enough to take off our $8 appetizer you would think that for the time spent, he would have been a little more apologetic.

It felt like we were somewhere else which is alway nice. We weren't seated in the shade and they said they would bring umbrellas but never did - this wasn't a huge issue for me it's a rooftop bar but the table next to me looked like they were going to pass out and were fanning each other with the menus for half the meal. At one point they even fanned me - no complaints there!  We started with the shrimp - really good, well seasoned with lemon zest. You get 4 pieces per order which I thought was decent. We each had the gnocchi. It was light and sauce was delicious. I had a personal carafe of the sorrento spritz - boy that went down well. Fairly sweet and very refreshing - not sure how much alcohol was in that. The Bloody Mary was pretty subpar - watery and neither of us could drink it.

3.0,8/22/2016,"I would rate this restaurant 3.5 STARS, if they allowed 1/2 STARS.  I dined her for lunch for the first time during restaurant last week.  We did not have a reservation because we decided to play it by ear once we arrived to Eataly.  They were nice enough to fit us in for lunch around 1PM without any wait.  I'd like to start off by reviewing the ambiance.  I love the open rooftop with decorative umbrellas and party string lights.  It really has a very beach bungalow vibe to it.  Also, there are large fans and umbrellas strategically placed so that each table would have shade and a breeze.  It isn't a large space, which would be my big complaint.  I felt like our table for 2 was almost touching another table for 2. The restaurant week menu was $29 for a 3 course meal with an additional $12 for wine pairing.  It was worth it.  We started with Scarola con Finocchio e Parmigiana Reggiano (Escarole with Fennel Salad) and Caprese Salad.  Perfect serving size and delicious.  Our entrees were Gnocchi al Pomodoro and Pollo e Fregola (Seared Cascun Chicken Thighs with Fregola pasta).  The Gnocchi was nothing to write home about and the serving was small.  The taste and appearance was not impressive at all.  The Pollo e Fregola, on the other hand, was delicious.  Well at least the chicken thighs were.  Some of the pasta had a hard to almost crunchy texture as if it were grilled.  I am still undecided as to whether or not I liked the  blend of soft and crispy pasta.  Finally, we decided on the Panna Cotta for both of our deserts, which is always delicious no matter where you go.  It's hard to screw up panna cotta!The staff was very attentive and arrived in a timely fashion with our food.  However, I was almost done with my dessert before they brought out the last wine pairing.  I probably would return for restaurant week, but not on a regular day.  The food was above average and good, but I don't like sitting so close to strangers where I have to be careful not to elbow the person sitting at the table next to me.It was a fairly busy afternoon and I was told that it is always busy so I recommend making reservations.  If you have time, be sure to check out the market downstairs  for a foodie paradise.",0,0,0,Ruthie R.,"Tampa, FL",74,39,66

That's kind of just what you want in a casual hangout for post-work drinks and the like. However, just about everything else about Birreria is severely lacking, which is a crying shame.First things first, it gets crazy packed here. The clientele is a mix of out-of-towners, tourists, and people who don't know how to drink anywhere except a rooftop. Yet, you'd think that even for a fairly touristy place, the food would be good since it's on top of a humongous market with great ingredients. However, most of the food we had was about the same quality as you'd find at any pub, perhaps even a little worse, and the portions are deathly small. Oy. That's a shame. Service has always been spotty, and while the servers are more or less friendly, they're far from efficient. It's also strange because the bar area always seems to have reservations, but no one shows up to these tables for hours and hours. The prices aren't good for beers (or the food), but the selection is pretty nice, and they always have a few good beers on tap that are harder to find.You should come here if it's a nice day during not- peak hours, and you aren't interested in eating.",47,34,43,Eric J.,"New York, NY",490,923,1792

I got a bunch of apps including a cheese skewer, mushroom salad, toast and something else that was so memorable that I forgot what it was. Doesn't that say a lot?!!!! The food was bland. I mean if this was that show ""the taste"" I might understand the concept of serving one bite of food per dish but come on...at the price they are asking for, they better have sourced the ingredients from Mars.....which may also explain why nothing tastes like anything. I also got the snitzel as an entree. Greasy! And bland. It would have been a perfect dish for George bush and his oil mongering ways. One of my friends wanted butter to put on her bread...they don't have butter. Honestly?!?!?!? There is a full out grocery store downstairs...but no butter.

There's a soft spot in my heart for Eataly, with all it's beautiful presentation and Mario's pedigree... so when #1 son said he'd like to eat here on our way through the city after college graduation my heart won out over your collective wisdom. The cheese and salami plates ARE small, bland, and overpriced. Do not ask for a gluten free option here. Doogie Houser, the manager, said it was their policy to bake everything in-house so it wouldn't be technically completely gluten-free. Really? SOMEWHERE in that delicious building there are gluten-free crackers to serve at a customer's request... couldn't one of the guys in breton stripes run across the street to Whole Foods? Aren't those shirts French? Completely unapologetic.The oysters were gamey but the casarecce con pesto and grilled Bohemian steak were quite good and the saving grace of the meal. My insalatona came out late after much insistence by the server that I'd ordered gnocchi. Ironic that the dollop (1/8 cup?) of tuna belly salad came on a piece of bread after all the gluten discussion.

3.0,5/26/2016,"This restaurant is a pop up. The food is over priced, but the rooftop dining area is amazing for drinks in the summer. We ordered the cheese plate and we were less than impressed. When it is the regular restaurant, we used to come and order the cheese plate and the charcuterie plate. This restaurant was strange. We got our cheese and they were so plain. One of the cheeses was a blue type and was soft, that was good and flavorful with a strong tang taste. The other 4 were hard cheeses and TASTELESS. I can't be anymore literal about that. One of them, I was extremely confused as to why they took a toddlers cheese and sold it to us. It looked and tasted just like a cheese you give a child. No taste whatsoever. The charcuterie plate was really good. They did a nice selection of mortadella, a dry salami, coppa, prosciutto and a couple other nice slices. What a meat plate should consist of. The wine selection is amazing. The rose section had maybe 7 different varieties. Some dry and some sweet. They are in order from sweet to dry. To me, nothing is better than a good rose on a rooftop on a hot day. The decor of this place is really adorable. Very summer style. They drape a thin blanket on your chair to wrap around you for sun protection. They had little signs telling you the direction for different cities. They gave it a nice beach feel. We also ordered these beef skewers which were amazing! Very tender and the flavor was perfect. Again, the portions are very small and the price is insanely high. I wanted to order oysters but $18 for 6, I can find oysters a lot less than $3 an oyster. The service was so-so.

2.0,5/23/2016,"Eataly, what happened?? The Birreria used to be my favorite spot in the city. The decor was airy, simple, tasteful; the wait staff was attentive, fun, but not overbearing; the wine list was incredible (wolffer rosé cider!), and the reason we all came back time & time again was the phenomenal food. Simple, no frills (in a good way), straightforward, incredibly high quality meats, cheeses, fresh salads -- everything you'd want in a mid-summer escape from the city below. The Birreria was a go-to special occasion / treat yo self spot with one of my best friends, we were regulars for years. Unfortunately, we visited again this past weekend after learning that our beloved Birreria was rebranded as ""Sabbia"", a restaurant with the theme of ""beachside Italy"".  Decided to give it a try and will not be returning. As we arrived at the top floor, we were overwhelmed with the new decor -- tacky taxidermy seagulls, buoys, picket fences by your table... kind of like Party City threw up in there. Once were seated, it took about 10 minutes for our waitress to come by. We asked her about the rosé cider that we love, and were sad to hear it was no longer on the menu. She suggested another sparkling rosé cider and brought us tastes, which were (both) flat and tasted like blueberry (we noticed later on the menu that the only cider they had -- the one she gave us -- was blueberry. Would have been worthwhile to mention). We asked our waitress for a taste of their driest rosé, as we were planning to share a bottle. She came by about 10 minutes later with a very sweet, dark pink wine. Again this is not what we had in mind, so we ordered the only other bottle on the menu and decided to just settle on that, which was frustrating as we recognized this bottle as the most expensive rosé on the old Birreria menu, and now was listed as the least expensive ($40/bottle) on the new menu. About 15 minutes later, our waitress -- who was becoming increasingly inattentive and unfriendly-- came by for our food orders. The menu has completely changed -- the new selections on the (aesthetically very busy) menu are overly complicated & the theme seems over the place, and everything is EXTREMELY expensive. For example -- the $24 salad which was supposed to be a take on a Niçoise was just a salad w/ a scoop of tuna fish on it (guy next to me ordered this)... Anyways, we got the meat & cheese plate and ""sausage with broccoli rabe"". When the food was ready, we were given 2 skewers with meatballs on them? Which we then realized was sausage meatballs with broccoli rabe IN them, but the way it was phrased on the menu, we were expecting... broccoli rabe with sausage. My friend bit into her meatball, which was raw. We didn't see our waitress for the majority of our meal, so we told her at the end and she was nice enough to remove this from our bill, which we appreciated. After our disappointing meal, we headed downstairs to look around. We went into the wine store and the bottle we had just ordered for lunch was available for $15 purchase. Pretty incredible to sell the exact same bottle upstairs for almost 200% more... Spare yourself this underwhelming (if not borderline bad) and very expensive experience. Too many other good restaurants in the area. Birreria was perfect as it was... as they say, if it ain't broke...",4,0,0,Emily R.,"New York, NY",236,14,1
2.0,5/22/2016,"This restaurant confirms my belief that Eataly is just an overpriced place for Italian food. You go to Eataly for the experience (which I admit is pretty fun), but there are definitely far too many good Italian restaurants in New York for one to waste time here. Our group of six started with a Riesling and the assorted platter of meats. You can get the exact same selection at the Piazza or any of the other restaurants downstairs. I was annoyed that there wasn't an option for both meat and cheese (unlike at the places downstairs), so you have to pay more if you want to get both.For our mains, we almost all opted for the seafood fusilli. Having recently had the fusilli at Marea, I may have had pretty high expectations, but the fusilli here was so plain and mediocre that I could have whipped it up myself at home. There was barely any seafood, the sauce was standard tomato, and the texture of the pasta was not al dente. It was not worth the $21.The rooftop also didn't offer any impressive views, so I'm not sure why I paid a premium to eat here.

Oysters on the half shell were reasonably priced and a fun start!  We ordered the five cheese platter and the meat platter.  Both were way over priced for the quantity presented.  The meat tray wasn't very good and was presented as just large lunch meat slices which was difficult for the group to share as an appetizer.The wait staff were attentive and helpful.  A bit of an arm wrestle to keep a couple of menus to decide on our meal choices left us laughing.Our group of 7 spent nearly $400 including tip but enjoyed our time together in the fun setting enjoying our graduation celebration.  I would definitely go here again for a special occasion, but a bit pricey for every day.",1,0,2,Shereen W.,"Huntington Beach, CA",0,39,1

The waitress was not the best.  We ordered sparkling water and since we had a large group, we always order the large bottle.  She said they only have small bottles, which is fine.  While we were waiting for our food, we noticed several other tables with large bottles.  I point it out to her and she didn't know what to say.  I also pointed out the cost of two smalls vs one large and there's a price savings on the larger bottle per ounce--even though she said they are the same.  I think the lower level restaurants at Eataly are much better.  Best to avoid Sabbia's food and maybe just go for drinks at the bar because the waitstaff is terrible along with the food.",0,0,0,T T.,"New York, NY",23,64,1

Three fat slices of undercooked flavorless eggplant surrounded by flavorless clumps of cous cous made up the $25 entree. The seared quail was soggy and gamey tasting, the artichoke fava purée underneath proved tasteless as well wasn't sure what it was until I remembered the menu promised artichoke and fava bean so assumed that it was hidden in the purée. Mozzarella was tasty. Olives subtle In flavor. You know the waitstaff knows it's not great when they see 90% leftover quail on the plate and don't ask how your meal was. Usually a sign the establishment doesn't care either. The dishes looked pretty but failed to engage the palette.

I said to him that it shouldn't take 30+ minutes for the first course - his response ""Well sometimes it does, our kitchen is small"" - proper response would have been to apologize!

4.0,5/2/2016,"Bottom line: A good experience as usual here at the newest incarnation of La Birreria. I like the lively bright summer theme. They had very flavorful eats and cocktails as we have come to expect here. Again, there can be a bit of sticker shock if you don't watch out. I'm a fan!The Deets:Sunday found us going up again to the 14th floor of Eataly NYC to enjoy a trip to La Birreria rooftop. Being a fan of the regular/original core format and the past recent colder month iteration of it in Baita at La Birreria, I was intrigued to find they had switch themes now to Sabbia at La Birreria this past weekend. Instead of Baita's winter Italian Alps type of theme, Sabbia is a bright summer beach type of atmosphere. I like the new changes in decor and look...bright, very upbeat and ready for the warmer months. We stopped by for a few drinks and some light eats for a Sunday Funday. Our server was very helpful and knowledgeable about the menu selections also. We had good service on our visit this time. You will recognize a lot of the selections on the menu from the original but of course there are some additions to appeal to the theme. We started out with Ferrari sparkling wine cocktails for a Sunday afternoon. My citrus one (Ferrari Brut NV, Lemon, Mint) was a winner with me, outstanding and refreshing but a bit of a sticker shocker at 15 bucks a pop. You got that right...I only had one of those tasty drinks. We opted for a carafe of Berry Bollicine (Serafini & Vidotto Bollicine Rose, Mirto Amaro, Strawberry, Peach, Niasca Mandarinata) to finish out with. To eat, we enjoyed a three cheese board then also ordered the Manzo E Bagna Cauda (Grilled Snake River Wagyu Beef with Seasoned Olive Oil). This one was just like the full entree version of the Wagyu Beef I've had here before, and it did not disappoint, excellent.

We also got a cheese plate and asked for bread, which didnt end up coming until we were close to done, and after we asked a second time.

I got one of the house Brewer beers which was solid, and our group shared a cheese and meat place as an appetizer. All of the items were Beth tasty, and I would be happy making a whole meal of those apps! I ordered the chicken for my entree which was also very tasty- the skin was nice and crispy and the fregola underneath added a nice element of chewiness to the dish. The only suggestion I have is to add more of some kind of green to the dish? There were little bits of asparagus in the fregola, but I probably could've counted the little bits which probably added up to maybe half an asparagus spear. Overall, Id probably come back here on a sunny day for the ambiance, although I'm more anxious to try all of the yummy things at the restaurants downstairs!",0,0,0,Rachel D.,"Cincinnati, OH",227,320,390

Beers are ranging from 7-11 dollars and whatever, it's NYC so let's charge this much.The food is the deal breaker completely. My friend and I ordered the plates of cured meats and it was 25$ for 10 thin slices!! And the meats were not even that great, just average but to charge this much was ridiculous! 12$ would have been overpriced on so little. We also ordered the Wagyu beef skewers which were good but again 10$ for 2 small skewers.The reason I am giving them 2 stars and not 1 is because the manager and the bartender were very nice and gave us our money back on the plate of cured meats.

3.0,12/2/2015,"My sister and I had reservations on a Wednesday evening at 7pm, but was running 15 minutes late, so we called the restaurant to inform them of such, and the hostess was very friendly and stated she'd make a note and it would be fine.The restaurant is actually located on the roof top of the building where Eataly is located. Upon arrival, we were asked what type of water we'd like, and it was immediately delivered. Our glasses were filled in a timely manner, but he spilled water onto the table and our menus in the process each time. I would prefer him to just pick up our glasses to fill our water versus watering the table each time. On top of that, we had to wait a while before our waiter finally showed up, though he did apologize for the wait. He seemed very busy, as it was a busy night, and it seemed as though they were under staffed at the time (I assume). He took our order and then dashed to the next table. At this point, I was starting to think there is no bread offered while we wait for our waiter, and our food. Again, our water was topped off, and my sister asked if we could get some bread. Bread appeared a the table just as fast as the water did. Considering the service, I decided to just order the entree and skip the appetizer and dessert, so we ordered the Pollo con Spinaci e Mela (Cascun Farms Seared Chicken Thighs with Sauteed Spinach, Apples, & Shallots) and the Baccala e Patate (house salt cured Atlantic Cod with Spinach, whipped Yukon Potatoes & Lemon). The chicken dish contained three pieces of chicken, two of which was cooked to perfection, but the third was ever so slightly under cooked. The cod dish was perfectly cooked and seasoned. The whipped potatoes and lemon had potato chunks in it, which I loved. It gave it a nice texture and you can really taste the Yukon potato. My only complain was that there wasn't enough potato and spinach to go with the piece of cod.I was pretty hungry, so I finished my entree when my sister just started on the second half of her entree. I watched my empty plate sit in front of me for a good amount of time although my water has been filled twice... Our waiter never checked on us. We actually had to flag down our waiter to get the check and then he scurried away to another table again. Busy. Busy. Busy. It is extremely loud in the restaurant. Can barely hear myself talk let alone the person sitting in front of me. The atmosphere was like a bar/lounge, but I've had better service at a bar than at this place.My only reason for coming back is for the whipped Yukon potatoes!

2.0,11/18/2015,"**More Like MEHlan**Not impressed. The price did not match the small portions, mediocre quality, and lack of hospitality.I'll put the worst first. PASTA DEL GIORNO -- The pasta was terrible...I know authentic pasta is often made al dente, but this just tasted undercooked and frankly kind of stale (even though it shouldn't have been since they supposedly make all their pasta fresh). I get fresh pasta from Uncle Giuseppe's and it is a whole lot better than the stuff they brought out...even Olive Garden is a step up.INSALADA DI CAVOLO, SPECK E UVA -- The salad was also terrible. I'm not sure what they did to the greens but they tasted crunchy and devoid of any sort of flavor. The apple slices were good but were so minisculely thin, I wonder how many salads they can make with just a single apple. This was probably one of the worst salads I had in 2015.COZZE ALLA BIRRA -- Mussels were meh. The sauce was nothing special but was at least pretty good to soak up with the complimentary bread.CROSTINI DI FEGATO D'ANATRA -- Pate dish was OK, but there was nowhere near enough of the crostini with which to eat it. Asking for more of the softer complimentary bread wasn't a big deal, but it wasn't designed to crispy enough for the pate and this dish suffered as a result.The complimentary bread was OK--again, nothing wrong with it, but considering they have a bakery onsite, I expected more than just some thin slices of some ""rustic"" looking bread, whatever that even means. I got their pasta beer, and while it was just OK (at ten bucks), I have to give it to them for trying to do something unique that fits in line with the restaurant. They otherwise have a couple other beers they make, as well as a decent selection, although some of them were grossly overpriced even for what I would expect them to run in a restaurant. Service was also a bit uninspiring--never rude but not attempting to be pleasant, which you'd expect for the price point.I will say the ambience was nice--tables felt nicely spaced apart, and there were great views of the Met Life tower and surrounding buildings.FINAL VERDICT: Try the pasta restaurant downstairs or simply go elsewhere with many great restaurants in this neighborhood at or slightly above this price range...it's not worth it.",0,0,0,Nick S.,"Stony Brook, NY",28,82,36

When we were informed of a beer crawl kicking off at Eataly's rooftop (Birreria) I was hesitant considering how much I hate the lower levels. But I decided I like beer, I like rooftops, and why the hell not? The elevator to the roof is tucked away by the 23rd street entrance. Downstairs there is a hostess that had no idea an event was taking place (umm ok?). The elevators lead you up to the 14th floor, followed by a staircase, and ta-da you've arrived at Birreria. Granted it's the end of October so it's on the cooler side, but it's not yet winter and therefore not yet cool enough to justify keeping the roof almost completely closed. It really does sport a greenhouse effect and you find yourself peeling of layers of clothing while gulping down beer in hopes of cooling off. I don't know if it was because of the event or because it was right before dinner time, but the place was packed and it was impossible to get to the bar.

I knew that I should have gotten me a beer but I got the awesome Bordeaux  like fruity zomo red wine instead, well bodied.

For my main mean I had the pasta of the day which was a fresh long cavatelli like pasta (unsure of the Italian name) with a nutty (almond) tomato, basil sauce. It was almost like tomato meets pesto. Tomato flavors, Pesto texture. $17. Looked small but portion was just right. My fiancé had the chicken thigh with some kind of pepper or tomato salad I don't recall. There was three thighs; they were a little small though. For $24. We supplemented with well done broccoli rabe but again it's not hard to make good rabe. We didn't stay for dessert. The whole bill was $75. Our server was very good, prompt and knowledgable. He answered all of our menu questions, and he put down a table stopper since our was wobbly. Space is ok. Nothing special.

Then our male waiter came over before introducing himself said ""you can't use this chair! I might have people sit here!""

We then said please tell us what you DO have and make sure the entire table orders a drink. He finally figured it out but again disappeared for 15 minutes. When he finally brought our drinks we were done with Apps. We asked if we could now place our entree order. Were there specials? Who knows?! Again the food flew out but the waiter never checked on us. I was so embarrassed mostly because I had friends in from another country and was excited to bring them to Eataly. Our waiter had such an attitude like we didn't just spend $700 on dinner. Sadly, I won't be back any time soon. Take note Mario Batali!!",1,0,0,Mimi C.,"Mohegan Lake, NY",30,37,0

2.0,10/11/2015,"Birreria is the rooftop Italian beer garden sitting above Eataly.  Being associated with Eataly, you would think the food should be amazing.  Unfortunately it isn't.Before I discuss the food, let me be fair and acknowledge that if you are coming here to drink beer, they definitely have a nice selection. Additionally, I did think the set up was quite nice although the rooftop tent the resturant is within does take away from the city views that should otherwise be available from the site.  I'm not sure whether the tent is just a seasonal thing or not.  However based on some of the other reviews I've just read, it sounds like it might be there year round.   I also noticed that the garden is still under construction to the east, so who knows what it is going to look like in the end.Anyway -  I would assume most people don't come here for the beer.  If you want beer, there are a zillion other bars and plenty of other beer gardens in NYC to choose from that will have just as impressive if not more impressive of a beer selection to pick from.If you are at Birreria, I have to assume you are like me and you came here expecting incredible food.  It's part of Eataly after all.  Unfortunately the food was completely underwhelming in my opinion.Everything I tried was boring with the lone exception of the Shiitake Fritti which was fried Shiitake mushrooms with sage.  That one appetizer was definitely memorable and I would love to have it again.  But other than that --- nothing stood out.  Even the 7 cheese platter --- which being cheese was good of course -- was pathetic in its size and offerings.  They were just little tiny pieces of cheese.  As for the entrees --- I had the ""Cotechino Con Peperoncini"" which was described as being: ""Emilia-Romagna inspired pork sausage with cannellini beans, broccoli rabe and Peperoncini"".  Sounds amazing right??  It wasn't!    For $24.00 a plate, I expected more than just two pieces of sausage sitting on top of broccoli rabe and beans.   Please don't get me wrong, it wasn't horrible.  I just didn't think it was amazing.  And since  Birreria is part of Eataly, I expected everything to be amazing.  It wasn't!I also was able to try the ""Pasta Del Giorno"" which was ""Afeltra Casarecce with Cherry Tomatoes, toasted almonds, basil and Peperoncino"".    Once again, that sounds amazing right?   Unfortunately, once again, it wasn't.   I found the pasta to be undercooked and actually chewy at points.  I was extremely surprised.  And the flavor of the Peperoncino just wasn't present.  There really wasn't any kick to the dish whatsoever.  Very disappointing on all fronts.As an aside -  I did think  the service itself was good.  No complaints on that side. But at the end of the day it's supposed to be about the food!!!   And if you are attached to Eataly, you have to make sure your food is mind blowing so that it makes me want to come back.  Do I want to come back????  No I don't. After my experience here, I decided to check out some of the other Yelp reviews and saw that I am not alone in my lackluster sentiment toward Birreria.  The owners should be aware and hopefully make some changes quick.  This place could be a goldmine --- although with the prices they charge, I imagine it already is despite the quality, so why listen to me!So at the end of the day, no matter how much I might like Eataly --- I won't be coming back to Birreria unless the reviews take a completely upward turn.  Let's hope they do!",0,1,0,Marc L.,"Sea Bright, NJ",21,463,395
1.0,10/8/2015,"I am a HUGE fan of Eataly as a whole. This was my first time to the Birreria. I was very disappointed.First off, the clientele is very nouveau-riche and kind of obnoxious. Next, the food menu is very limited and expensive, but I figured, what the heck, I'll treat myself. I ordered a 17 dollar portobello entree, billed to be served with whipped goat cheese and beets. What I got was one small portobello mushroom cap sliced into 8 slivers with a tablespoon of goat cheese and 2 thin mandoline slices of a very miniature beet. I was VERY hungry after finishing it.Also the red wine we bought was very fumey and cheap (9 dollars a glass, but cheap in quality), which I find shocking for Eataly. Italians don't drink bad wine, it's not a thing! This morning, all 4 of us feel very hungover from 2 glasses of the stuff. I am just very confused why Eataly aligns itself with this caliber of food and drink.

2.0,9/20/2015,"As we made our way up to the 14th floor of eataly it felt very exclusive, almost like a members club. On arriving at the top I'm not sure what I was expecting exactly but it definitely included some sort of view across Manhattan and perhaps a cool breeze. It was a little sad, the views were pretty non existent, even the skywards one was shielded as it was too sunny. The canopy was acting like a heat trap. It was sweltering in this place. I arrived, I was already hot, I got even hotter and I was definitely ready for a drink. Not wanting to eat, we were shepherded into a smallish penned off area, which was somewhat crowded and designated for those just wanting a drink. The beer menu was pretty extensive but expensive, I opted for a cider which had strong notes of ginger which were very present. I really loved the taste, though not the wisest choice as I was already feeling hot and the ginger just amplified this. My friends were all pleased with their drink choices too. We eventually found an empty high table and crowded around. With drinks in our hands and a table to lean on, suddenly the place didn't seem so terrible. However, on leaving, someone was having a turn and feeling quite poorly. They looked ready to faint! The staff here were not the most helpful. When the lady asked for something sweet for her family member to drink, such as orange juice none of the staff moved, the lady had to go and get it herself. I would have expected at least someone from the staff to act at least somewhat compassionately but they dutifully just manned their stations and looked as though this was an everyday occurrence. Come on people, at least act as if you are human, with some sort of charitable nature which makes me not feel ashamed to be a part of the human race.I'm not sure how the scenario unfolded but I hope the guy was okay! Birreria you should train your staff for such possibilities so you at least look like a business that gives a damn about your patronages welfare and so that your staff at least look competent in such circumstances!",0,1,0,Parvinder H.,"Manchester, United Kingdom",89,213,113

2.0,8/28/2015,"Let me preface this review by first saying that this used to be my go to spot for after work drinks... However, recently I went there for dinner and was very underwhelmed by the experience (euphemistically speaking). We were a group of four : my friend and her husband visiting from Montreal, me and a common friend (two NYC girls who have been to Birreria several times and go out to eat in 4-5 times a week on average). First, my friend was hungry and wanted a snack with the drinks while the rest of us looked through the menu and decided on our appetizers / mains - she ordered Portobello fries and we each placed our drink orders.... After 20 minutes when placing the rest of our order, we enquired about the missing fries and were told that the order hadn't been entered into the system because all appetizer orders had to be entered together (seriously, why not tell us this right at the beginning???!!!????).Anyway, on to the main courses: my other friend has a gluten intolerance and she limits her dairy intake so she opted for a Caesar salad with no dressing. I wish I had taken a picture of her salad - it was 4 lettuce leaves (not chopped) with 2 croutons...that's almost 5$ per lettuce leaf lol!!! And when she asked for a small sprinkle of parmesan cheese - the waiter refused saying it was outside kitchen policy !!! Anyway, the pasta dishes lacked flavor and my wine had a lot of sediment and was clearly from the bottom of the bottle....We spoke to the manager who was entirely unhelpful and the experience left a bad taste overall and needless to say I will not be returning to this establishment.",0,0,0,Anushree M.,"Manhattan, NY",34,5,0

We didn't make reservations and it was a Friday night, so we expected a wait (if we could get in at all). The hostess said it would be a 90 minute wait when we checked in at 8:30 PM. We poked around Eataly--it's amazing--and then got a drink next door while waiting for her to text us when a table opened up. After only 45 minutes we got a text! Score!Birreria is on the 14th floor rooftop of the Eataly building. The view of the lit buildings at night was quite spectacular! We got a carafe of wine from Tuscany and they served bread/olive oil. I ordered Wagyu steak with onions, mushrooms and pea purée. My hubby got the pork shoulder. We also split a side of mashed potatoes that were prepared with olive oil. We both loved our meals and the potatoes were the best!! Absolutely delicious meal!Birreria lost one star just for the service. Our server was very friendly but she seemed to be stretched too thin. It took about 20 minutes to get a drink order going with her, and then we waited much longer to get those drinks. The food came out much faster than we were anticipating, which was good and bad because we wanted to relax and savor our last dinner in NYC.

Absolutely beautiful view, and one of the best meals I've ever had. Before our meal, we had also the whole meat platter and cheese platter to share between the table- definitely a nice variety of consistencies in cheeses and tastes of meats (I had thought it couldn't get better from here on out- but I was wrong- the meal was even better!). The steak was cooked perfectly, and I tried the lamb chops which were really freakin great as well. My only complaint is how does a restaurant in Eataly not have several pasta options?!?!?! I was SO confused by this, and disappointed. However, though disappointed, I was at least happy that pasta wasn't there to direct me away from the great meat options they had. Definitely seems like it gets packed, and even though we had a reservation, we didn't get in right away... but I promise, it's worth the wait. Pretty pricey, so I'd probably be back just for occasions. If you are in Eataly and looking for a nice sit-down restaurant (rather than the casual spots they have in the market), this is the place for you.**EDIT - Got to revisit this place years later, just for drinks and apps. Loved the meat and cheese plate once again. I got froze and it was delicious and HUGE!! $17 for the froze but at least the size made it worth it.

Any of the german lagers are great in the summer. It's a large outdoor roof beer hall on top of Eataly. Plenty of tables to sit down for a meal. The bar is on the far side but for a beer hall a bit small. It can get a bit crowded on busy happy hour times. It's a good place for a work lunch as the pork shoulder which i ordered was super tasty and tender. Any of the charcuterie was great too. The mortadella, speck, salumi and sopressata goes well with the beer and casual conversation. I would of given 4 stars but to me it is a bit pricey for this kind of food fare. If the price points were a bit better definitely a 4 star kinda place where you'd frequent often. But as is it's for those special occasions.",1,0,2,Kevin C.,"New York, NY",1570,775,1785

Hostess kept our group of 8 waiting, standing right in front of her, for a few minutes while she finished up a phone call. Never even looked up to acknowledge us.After she hung up the phone, she explained the rule that everyone seated at a table was required to order a meal. If we weren't into that, it would be standing room only at the bar.Then she said even if we did want to sit at a table, it would be a really long wait.And kindly added that the bar was super crowded too.Then she looked at my pregnant belly and snottily said ""You're going to have to stand the entire time. Will that work for you?"" No offering of a possible seat or any way to accommodate me, no sign of empathy. A negative attitude all around and generally unpleasant demeanor.Who hired this person?

I had the vegetarian pasta, I didn't like the tubular spaghetti so much, but the bocconcini was gorgeous and they gave us a free salad too!

4.0,7/4/2015,"This is on the 14th floor of the eataly building. The sign for it is near the back of eataly, and there's a host stand who will tell u that the space is in capacity and they'll text u. I think I waited about 20 mins for the initial text. Once texted, you're permitted to enter the holy elevator to take u up to the 14th floor. Once there, you will need to put your name on another list for a table and wait to be texted again. That is, unless you are lucky to find a spot at the bar or a high top where it's self seat full serve. I got thru all the texts and wait time (about 40 minute wait at the bar) and we were seated. This is a rooftop bar but the views are pretty much nonexistent, so if you're looking for a nice view this isn't the spot. However, if you don't care about the view and just want good drinks and food, this is your place.Wine was delicious, had some cheese and entrees. The cheese is amazing, it was super fresh and they serve it with oil and hazelnut honey , and a few pieces of bread. The bread could have been better, toastier, but still I enjoyed this very much. I had the ricotta, parm, and something similar to Brie but I forget the name.Entrees were pork shoulder for me and steak for my bf. I highly recommend the pork shoulder, it was so tender, cooked perfectly, with this flavor on the charred outside which was smokey and sweet and paired so well with the meat and my wine. I loved it so much! It comes w some apple slaw, which didn't stand compared to the pork. Get it anyway. The steak also doesn't compare to the pork, it had way less flavor and wasn't as tender.

Even downstairs INSIDE Eatly, there is better food. And a little disappointing that there was only ONE pasta dish on this menu at all and it was a special that particular night (some sort of pesto/ and pasta dish which was severely lacking in flavor).

3.0,6/23/2015,"I've gone to this place three times - in warm weather. It first came up through a yelp search for rooftop bars when I was new to the city last summer. I really enjoy taking visitors here because it is in the flatiron district so I think it is a cool scene and can give a visitor some of those classic NYC vibes and the iconic flatiron building. It is pricey, but from what I understand all of Eataly is. I think they don't have a happy hour because in nice weather the bar gets super crowded anyway, but I think they should consider adding a happy hour (at least a few times a week) and expanding the bar area. The tables are only for dinner but I've noticed each time I've been here that a lot of the tables are empty and they could move the tables closer together to maximize the space. I think they would only benefit from having more bar space.Oh, the Bloody Mary's here are amazing - with delicious, tangy blue cheese. I also really like the fried mushrooms (funghi) on the appetizer menu - I get them every time I come here.

There is no a/c, no fans, although they attempt to add shade which takes away from the open air/rooftop affect - a lot of the view is obstructed. I know it's technically rooftop but they could/should attempt to cool it down somehow IMO. Great beer selection although if you get a larger size, they should try to put it in an ice bucket or something - it gets warm fast. Nice place for a snack like bread, cheese and meats, but not too impressive menu to be honest. Menu changes seasonally too FYI. The duck pate is really good and rich but not enough bread/crostini for amount of pâté they give. The sweetbreads are good too but too rich -it's hard to eat more than a couple per person. The Parmesano reggiano cheese from the cheese selection is delicious. So is sopressata. Not too spicy. There was a grilled octopus special that was good. It was perfectly cooked. Prices are ok. Not outrageous. But it is eately and the prices are a bit gougey. So keep that in mind. But food quality is high. Definitely make a reservation. They won't even let you upstairs w/o one.

They have retractable roofs and a pleasant aesthetic. Their drinks menu was extensive and they have good ciders on hand. I recommend the Wolffer Estates cider- it's like a rose and a cider got married and had a delicious baby. It was refreshing and just right for the season.Since we were crafty, we also put our name down for the dining area and 20 minutes after we got our initial text, we got another confirming that a table had freed up so we went to the host area by the entrance of the bar and they sat us immediately.

My girlfriend and I were extremely excited on Saturday April 18th as the weather in NY turned for the better and we finally had the opportunity to go to Birreria which we talked about all winter. We made it up to the rooftop to the bar area which was very crowded (totally expected on our part given the awesome weather that day). We began to make our way towards the left side of the bar as more and more people grabbed their drinks and moved to the back once served. Finally we reach our destination and the last people ahead of us begin giving their orders. As we are waiting, two patrons get up from their stools and to our amazement there are now two seats available at the bar which we grab quickly. We are now seated at the bar, and at this point we've made our drink decisions long ago. We wait patiently as I try to make eye contact with the bartender. I begin to notice a trend as we are waiting that made little sense to me, it seemed as though we had been sitting for a while and overlooked by the bartender many times. I noticed new people approaching the bar and being served well before we were even greeted/acknowledged. As one patron to my left approached the bar for the first time and is greeted immediately and their order is taken I raise my hand as to say ""this can't be!""Upon raising my arm this IMMEDIATELY catches the eye of the bartender (for the first time) and the following dialogue follows:""what?! what?! IT IS CROWDED""-bartender""I know, we've been waiting to order""-me""come on, what do you want? WHAT DO YOU WANT?""-bartender*I stare blankly knowing there is no way I can possibly give someone talking to me in this way my money*""WHAT DO YOU WANT?....COME ON...this is the part where you order.""-bartenderI look at my girlfriend and I say ""come on lets go."" The awful part about all of this is that even though I was being spoken down to I really did want to order from the rude bartender just to try and save our trip to Birreria since we had been looking forward to it so much. I just couldn't justify tipping/giving this place my money after an experience like that. As we were leaving, patrons close to the bar were laughing as if I was acting irrational by leaving. I started to question whether or not we were being patient enough. We went back downstairs to the host stand located in Eataly by the elevator and I requested to speak to the manager. The two men working down there called upstairs and told me ""it is crowded and both managers on the floor cannot leave right now."" It being crowded/busy seemed to be the common theme of this place.So we went on our way. I later went to another bar that was equally as crowded where we grabbed two seats. We were greeted and served with a smile. I then realized that I was not in the wrong, and that a bartender being busy should never be my problem. I worked in the industry and the number one rule is to not let your customer know what kind of day you're having. There's really no excuse. If someone cannot handle high pressure situations, they probably cannot handle most jobs.I wish I had a better experience.",9,1,2,Daniel D.,"Manhattan, NY",0,2,3
5.0,4/18/2015,"Excellent food, outstanding service, and marvellous views. Birreria is a great roof bar, located on 5th Ave just across the street from the Flatiron Building. It's shaped in Italian style with Italian dishes and beverages.They also brew their own beer, which is a great mix between the American and Italian cuisines; the Italians aren't particularly well-known for their beers.Highly recommended - just enter Eataly from W 23rd Street and you have the elevator right on your left.",2,0,1,Ludwig K.,"Stockholm, Sweden",10,61,41
4.0,4/17/2015,"It was perfect me and a friend got there before it got crowded so we were seated quickly but it was like walking through a maze trying to find that place, but the view from where we were seated was just spectacular.The food is another story. My friend got the Portobello Alla Griglia which is grilled Portobello mushroom with whipped goat cheese and beets. It was okay. We didn't love it but didn't hate it.I ordered the Pulled Pork Sandwich and I must say it was a bit dry. I feel like it needed a sauce or spread of some sort. The pulled pork was a bit burnt. Don't get me wrong I love a little bit of char on my food but my pork was just a tad too burnt. Maybe it was just an off day but I would be interested in going back to try other items on the menu. Plus it's on a rooftop so enjoying a beer and food with a great view is always a plus.

The place was immensely crowded when we finally did get upstairs. I couldn't see much of the venue because it was so packed, but I liked the glass ceilings.

Three, the bar has a retractable rooftop with great heating to keep you comfortable. Four, the place was packed!

From what my dishes, it seems like the food is really good, but not really amazing. I shared the cheese plate (ricotta, some brie-type, and a gouda? Can't remember anymore) which was delicious and the steak. The steak was cooked perhaps a bit too much but was still juicy and good. The sauce under it - squash beer cream - was fantastic.

4.0,3/28/2015,"I've gotten into the habit of trying to wait to review a place after at least 2 visits but this is a place that I most likely won't be back to for at least a little while. So this is based off of first impressions but as you can see from the star rating, they didn't do such a bad job! Birreria is a small part of Eataly: a metropolis of Italian goods including pizza, pasta, a steakhouse, gelato and other specialty restaurants. This restaurant in particular is located on the roof. Although we came late on a Saturday afternoon, we were promptly seated and our order was quickly taken. I tried two of the house beers (insert Jay Mohr reference) and enjoyed them, but at $10 a glass was expecting a lot more. Then again this is NYC where you spend $20 just for walking outside your door so I can sorta understand. The food on the other hand was quite exceptional. I tried the blood sausage which I've never had the pleasure of trying and it was delicious! I highly recommend getting it if you want to try something different and non-traditional. I also thoroughly enjoyed our cheese plate appetizer but come on, who doesn't like cheese?From start to finish our server was on top of her game, asking us if we needed anything and topping off our water glasses. Oh and that bread they give you...divine and they ain't shy about giving you more! I know from experience...So if you're in the neighborhood, be sure to check out Eataly and visit Birreria while you're at it.

2.0,3/22/2015,"As you can read in many of the reviews before mine, Birreria is the rooftop bar and restaurant on the top of the Eataly building. Rather inconveniently located in the corner of Eataly near the check out is the elevator up to the top floor. You climb one more flight of stairs and you finally get to your destination.As today was an absolutely stunning day with blue sky and crisp early spring air, it could not have been more beautiful up there. The expansive, open restaurant that has a glass ceiling that slides open on days such as these made me so grateful to be living in this city. I could see the Flatiron building from my seat. How amazing is that?? If only the food and service were on the same level as the ambiance and decor. From the overcooked pork (no I don't usually eat pork but I allowed myself a bite because my friends raved about the meat at Eataly) to the just not good tasting fish, I was unimpressed with the comida. And the service was a disaster. They took a half hour to bring my beer after taking about the same amount of time to bring my friend's wine. They brought our entrees before the appetizer plates were cleared - not a huge deal but the table was covered with dirty plates for 10 minutes and they tried to fit the new dishes onto the table of dirty plates. Poor form.It just seems like the restaurant is poorly run because it has many of the fundamental elements that would make this a really special location. Sadly, at least today, that was not the case.

The hostess showed us to a table & then left us standing there, saying she had to check & see if we could be seated. ?!  So after standing there for several minutes we sat down. A manager approached & informed us we couldn't be seated until the whole party arrived. Utter BS. She went on about it being dinner time & crowded, which it wasn't in the least. We asked to be given menus so we could order appetizers to be on the table when our friends arrived. Finally, she arranged for a different table for us, but was NOT Friendly at all. We had two different waiters, both of whom had attitudes & passive aggressively ignored us. I should note that one couple nearby left shortly after being seated for lack of service & an elderly couple was similarly ignored. For the $500 our group spent there over two and a half hours, I'm honestly shocked at the behavior of all of these employees.

I couldn't tell you, but the dude clearly was more into chatting up tables than actually waiting on them.After ordering dessert (our mistake), we proceeded to wait another 15 minutes while our non server-server chatted up the same couple, then moved on to another table for ten minutes and ignored us as well as another table behind us. This now makes 25 minutes we had been waiting for him to come over and give us our check. Or make contact. Anything.

I didn't like the mashed potatoes because it had a weird texture and I didn't like the olive oil in it.Overall, I had a good time and I liked the restaraunt.

3.0,1/3/2015,"Nothing amazing, but not bad either. That's sort of all I can say about La Birreria. I was super jazzed to try it out. I live near Eataly and had been there numerous times, but never to the rooftop restaurant. I was meeting a friend for dinner and someone at work mentioned the roof at Eataly, and I thought:""Self, this is as good a time as any to hang with the cool kids and try Eataly's roof"". So we went - to be cool. It. Was. Packed. I mean, people everywhere in the bar area. Loads of open tables, the space is pretty huge, with the giant glass ceiling that opens and closes depending on the weather. While that's awesome and all, I would never, EVER, come back for a drink at the bar, which is what I think this place is good for. People were wall to wall and shoving and it just looked like it must be miserable to be standing there, without anywhere to put your drink, pushing your way to the bar. Also? It was all youngsters. I mean the early 20's crowd. Fratty looking guys and chicks who were twirling their hair. I mean really. I get the appeal for some people, but it's not my thing. BUT - we were having adult time and had a table. Winning. We started off with some wine the waitress suggested and it was very good. We shared three cheeses and a cured meat off of their starter menu. Specifically: Robiola Bosina (cow's/sheeps milk, soft and tangy, piemonte) which looked and tasted a lot like brie. Win! Provolone Mandarone (cow's milk, semi-soft, spicy finish, lombardia) which I liked a lot as well, fairly classic Provalone. Gorgonzola Dolce (cow's milk, semi-firm & peppery, piemonte) this was a really excellent, buttery blue. Everything was served with hazelnut honey, which was such a great addition and really added to the cheeses. We also had a single plate of the Speck (smoked prosciutto from Alto-Adige) and that was good, but a little smokey for my taste. (Not the fault of the restaurant, it does say smokey on the menu - and it wasn't my first choice meat). The entree was pretty tasty, I had their market fish special, which was a Swordfish, lightly seared and on a bed of mashed lima beans. It was very light and also filling. I loved that it was healthy and didn't make me want to immediately get in a cab and go home. We ordered a dessert, too, because we thought why not and had the Tre (rice sponge cake soasked with rum syrup with three layers of chocolate. Bavarian dark, milk and white chocolates). I mean...wow. I don't even really like chocolate, but this was so light and spongy and just perfectly put together. We essentially licked the cup clean. I know, classy, right? I wasn't thrilled by the food, loads of hype and it didn't amaze me. I would love to come back for a glass of wine (they have a great wine selection) and the Tre dessert, but I wouldn't put myself through dealing with that insane bar scene, and I was there on a Tuesday at 6:30....not exactly a prime time or a big ""going-out"" night.

I enjoyed their duck as well, I would definitely recommend asking for it to be medium rare, the chef did an amazing job preparing it.  I thought the bohemian steak was sub par and the sausages were okay.  Overall I think the food and service was OK, nothing spectacular.  The highlight of the night is probably the view, worth a try, but not something I'd come back and wait for again.",0,0,0,Gui Bin Z.,"New York, NY",61,279,8

4.0,12/4/2014,"While Dante's Divine Comedy locates gluttons at the third circle of inferno (hell)*, Eataly's likes to put them in a rooftop ... closer to heaven(yelp.com/user_local_phot…)Birreria came along with a few nice surprises, particularly if you have never heard of it. In addition to a retractable roof to expose what I can imagine a beautiful skyline, Birreria is also a brewery on its own. Beer menu is extensive, beers are good and prices are surprisingly low. We also had some bites: the Salumi selection consisting in 5 different cuts of cure meats (recommended) and the 7 cheese selection plate with Ricotta, Parmiggiano, Asiago, Gorgonzola and a couple more. The cheeses were fantastic. I am seriously still thinking on the ricotta and the Gorgonzola, after a few weeks of visiting. Great starters or complement when you are ""just"" drinking. In addition hazelnut honey along with bread were served. Beautiful and tasteful. Aesthetics have plenty of room for improvement. Although the space is pretty large making it the perfect destination for groups. Similarly, service won't earn a Michelin. It is correct, adequate and not that efficient. Which is all fine. This is a birreria, therefore space and service I don't have it much on count on the overall equation. Just for the record, like the other side of a coin you can find subpar-overpriced-food and beer at Belgian Beer cafe Nomad, a couple of blocks away, but yes on a really nice space with top notch service. Everyone's happy in NYC.Nonetheless, getting to this circle of heaven is not an easy task on crowded times. Which I can imagine is most of them. Particularly because you have to cross al the way inside Eataly (not fun) and likely to wait your turn to get into the elevator. Oh well, you going to heaven! Just be patient I guess. Ironically, I heard this place gets quite hot on summer days ... like an inferno I wondered? Not that far from Dante's at the end don't you think? regardless, Hell or Heaven it doesn't really matter.

Last night was a bit of a let down to say the least. Service was slow and inattentive. Huge lag in time between our first round of drinks + cheese plate and the main course. No offer of dessert menus at the end. I had to flag the waitress down to order another drink. Dinner was underwhelming in both flavor and presentation. The room was super cold and drafty. I know it's a roof bar and some drafts are probably unavoidable from the retractable roof, but it was chilly enough that my boyfriend wore his coat throughout the entire meal. All of this is surprising since it wasn't even full and certainly not one of the busier nights I've seen here. Not sure what the staff was so busy with that they couldn't check on our table or get the food out in a timely fashion. I'm also hugely surprised and disappointed at the general lack luster feel of the meal, especially considering the hefty price tag at the end.

We finally heard the specials and ordered cocktails and salami/cheese plates.  They came out pretty quickly and were delicious.  Then we ordered our second course. I was full after the cheese so ordered the Prime Rib 'Salad' which when it finally arrived was just strips of tasteless  carpaccio so I ordered a garden salad which was this over-seasoned, over dressed mess of greens. The pork shoulder everyone raves about was mediocre to me.  We ordered desserts and coffee and had to wait nearly a half hour.  The waitress said the backup was from 6 tables ordering at the same time.  But when the desserts arrived, they were all pre-made 'puddings' so her excuse was lame,  though the the  Panna Cotta, Tiramisu and Tre, were delicious and the highlights of the meal.

3.0,8/25/2014,"My friends and I came here because we wanted to experience a rooftop bar/restaurant before the summer ended. It was also my first time in Eataly. But, this review is for La Birreria, so that's what I'll talk about.First, it is a little hard to find the elevator that leads up to the place. Even though my friend has been there before, we still had to ask for directions. Second, the elevator leading up to the place is hidden behind a little desk with one attendant. I don't know what he was doing or selling. And third, after we got into the elevator, there is two small flights of stairs that we still had to climb to get there. We had a reservation for 6:00pm, so the two hostesses told us to go ahead to the bar before our other two friends arrived. It was 5:30pm and the bar was already packed. There was barely any room to stand, let alone order a drink. But we managed to order and pay for some wine and beer at the very end of the bar. (When we left, the bar was overflowing with people. I guess this is expected, as rooftop bars are prime spots for socializing after work.) Once it turned 6:00 and another friend showed up, the hostess let us to our table. The restaurant area has more room and feels airier, probably due to the sliding roof panels that let in the natural sunlight. (There were workers who slid them open and closed because there was a threat of some rainfall.)  When the entire party was there, we ordered the 7 cheeses and 1 meat plate. It came with bread and honey and was delicious. We ran out of bread at one point and they gave us extra bread, for free. After the food, we had all three desserts. They were all in tiny glasses and were beautifully presented. I feel like I could've eaten all of one dessert, but we shared, because that's what friends do. :)The service was good, but there was only one waitress for the entire restaurant area. Even though the busboys were helping her keep an eye on the tables, I think she could have used some help. I would come back for the food and to try the different wines and beers, but the bar area turns me off. So if you're looking for a nice, quiet area to relax after work, I wouldn't recommend the bar.

After about 10 minutes the front of house came out and asked us if we were going to eat a meal. We said we were happy to start with a drink and our nibbles (mainly as it was 4 30! ) but the front of house starrted raising her voice to me, asked me to 'just not lie and tell her the truth' if we were really going to have a main meal, and when we said we genuinely didn't know due to how long the kids would last she kicked us out.

2.0,8/19/2014,"I'm so disappointed by my time tonight at eataly. This was my second time on the rooftop. The first time we had an AMAZING server I wish I could remember his name. I had the steak it was perfectly cooked and the salsa verde was a perfect match for the meat. The server recommended a a grey beer for me as well. However, tonight we had a completely different experience. To start off we were greeted by the busboy who was great and answered a few of our questions. Ten minutes later.. Our server, patrick m, showed up. I had requested a Malbec at the bar whole waiting for our table (which we had reservations for) the bar tender said he had something similar, he did, and it was great. At the table I asked patrick what it could have been I was drinking. He scoffed, and said he didn't know what it could've been because the only wine he thought resembled a Malbec was $20 a glass. I'm not sure what this was supposed to mean? Regardless I ordered that wine, which, turned out to be different from my previously ordered wine. We ordered drinks and an appetizer.. Our cheese came out quickly. We waited twenty minutes until patrick came back to take our order (still no drinks)... I had to ask him twice for the specials the first which happened to be an appetizer that he neglected to introduce to us when we ordered our appetizers. I ordered the pork which was tender and delicious but had a lot of fat. However my friend ordered the same and didn't have the same issue. We never saw patrick again until it was time for the check that we ha to ask for and he seemed annoyed by...

1.0,8/13/2014,"This is not a restaurant -- it's a beer garden with a food menu that should only be used in case of emergencies. And even still, the staff may not be able to recommend which beer to order. Simply put, our party of 6 ended the meal hungry (still nibbling on the very mediocre bread we had received nearly two hours prior), and worried about food poisoning. Half of the meals we ordered were alarmingly under-cooked and our attempt to make that known seemed like nothing more than a nuisance to the underwhelming and clearly unhappy staff. Yet, the main reason for the single star rating is the true lack of service at La Birreria. Walking into that restaurant, despite the beautiful setting and our spacious corner table overlooking the city, felt like walking into a room full of people talking about you, with only negative things to say. The staff didn't want us there - they wanted to go home, and they made that clear when they started stacking chairs on tables and mopping the floors before our uneaten plates were even cleared from the table. If the restaurant caterers itself to tourists then it does a terrible job welcoming outsiders to a city known largely for its food culture; and if the restaurant caterers itself to locals, then it does a terrible job representing what it feels like to be a true New Yorker.Oh, and a bit of advice to those who venture for a meal at La Birreria: don't bother asking if this Italian restaurant (remember, ""Italy is Eately"") serves pasta or pizza. You might as well walk in and ask if you can order a side of rice and beans.",5,1,1,Sarah R.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,12,0
1.0,8/13/2014,"B&B should quite literally be embarrassed to put their name on La Birreria. The market is great, the reputation precedes itself, but they clearly have not set foot on the rooftop in ages because if they did they would find a restaurant that has none of the old-world, authentic charm they deign to create. I can not express the level of my disappointment anymore thoroughly. Based on our experience, the self-loathing that is omnipresent at LBstarts at the top - they need to purge the entire staff, and find people that are proud to work in this environment, otherwise they will continue to suffer from a shrinking reputation that may come from overextension of an Empire.Upon prompt arrival for our 9pm reservation, our party of six was sat at a pretty nice table near the back. Ten minutes passed before we were approached by our server, who was quite unfriendly. One of our out-of-town guests asked ""do you have pasta"" (they don't), only to receive a very snappy ""NO pasta, NO pizza"" followed by an eyeroll. We proceeded to order a round of beer from their in-house brewery - our drinks didn't arrive until 9:2. Once the beer arrived, we ordered appetizers - an overly battered and heavily fried mushroom dish as well as their panzanella salad, which was the size of a CD. Definitely not a sharable portion, but at least it was drenched in dressing and barely palatable. As the clock struck 9:30, our now heavily annoyed & unhappy server urged us to order as ""the kitchen closes soon."" Our apologies, I guess, as we were essentially ignored for a half hour and now the onus is on us to rush. But order we did, picking through the very limited scope of food on the menu - two orders of lamb chops, one order quail, one order chicken, and two orders steak - one medium, one medium well. The food came out fast - too fast, evidenced by the embarrassing preparation. I have accompanied this review with pictures for perusal to show that *the lamb was charred on the outside (yum!) and literally PURPLE on the inside (wow!)*the steak was bloody and red (um, this is medium?) and nearly inedible - we didn't order tartare, my friends.While nearly everyone at the table was (literally) disgusted by our meat, we tried to catch the server's attention - not an easy task, as he was embroiled in an internal fight with another server and somebody from the back of the house that may or may not have been a chef. By the time our server did acknowledge our table, we showed him the three dishes that were unpalatable. ""What do you want me to do,"" was his response. Very interesting - no apology, no solution, just attitude. ""Can you have them cooked properly?"" we responded. He scoffed, took the plates and returned with - get this - an offer of pork shoulder, which none of us had ordered, ""because it's a quick dish for the kitchen to prepare."" NO we don't want to change our orders at the last minute - we want what we ordered! He once again told us that the kitchen is ""nearly closed"" so instead he offered to take them off of our bill, showing all of the anger of a man both dissatisfied with his job and enraged by the tip amount decreasing by the minute. This was not, of course, a proper resolution, as we came to the restaurant and eat - not be regaled by the histrionics of a staff that is completely in disarray, as we noticed yet another imbroglio occurring near the cash register, obviously revolving around our unappetizingly prepared dishes. At this point, I searched for the manager. Not an easy task, as we found her hiding in the kitchen. I say 'hiding,' because as soon as one of the nicer staff (a busboy) garnered her attention, she knew immediately which table I represented and said brusquely ""we already took the dishes off your bill, I don't know what else I can do."" Subsequently, she started to defend the kitchen, ""well, you guys did order right before the kitchen closed. . ."" No we didn't - we made reservations at 9 and we sat at 9, and we ordered at 9:30. If incompetent management can't complete the order/service cycle in a half hour, there are greater problems than  our order. Either way, I didn't want to make a scene so I walked back to the table where our discounted bill was $246.It literally saddens me to write this review. I had very high expectations for my meal at La Birreria, and was disappointed in every fashion. The service was atrocious, the food was woefully undercooked, we were rushed to order and through our meal, and the manager did little to rectify the problem. Additionally, it was clear that there is a major disconnect between the back of the house & the wait staff and that was evident by the multiple, public bickerings between staff members ON the restaurant floor. I will say one sizable positive about LB - it is a very nice venue with a sizable rooftop patio enveloped by great views of the city, the sky, the moon & stars.",16,1,1,Evan L.,"Sherman Oaks, CA",262,628,844
3.0,8/11/2014,"It was very difficult to get a table without reservation, even on Monday night around 8 pm. A party of four was seated around 8:30 pm after waiting for about 30 minutes. The outside seating was nice. That day wasn't too hot, so it was actually quite pleasant. My friends got beer --well given the name -- and they seemed satisfied. Being no beer fan, I got a glass of red. It wasn't impressive, but was okay given the price range. The four of us shared 1 appetizer and 3 dishes - fried mushrooms, rack of lamb, braised pork shoulder, and the sausage platter. I would say the food was almost disappointing given the hype the downstairs gave.  Fried mushrooms - Way too salty! I am not one of those people who never eat European food and are not used to saltiness, or anything. The mushroom itself could have been okay, but the strong salt taste was jarring. Also, it felt as if the batter was a little too thick on mushrooms and the essence of mushrooms was somehow lost. Rack of lamb - Didn't try. I let my three companions (...all guys...) have their fill. But the guys were satisfied with the dish.  Braised pork shoulder - My philosophy is that if you go to a place you've never been to and want really good food, you should just go for braised red meat whenever possible. So this place got the texture right. The braised, fall-off-the-bones (no bones in this dish, but you know what I mean) kind of nice texture. But then, the glaze somehow didn't work with the meat. It just didn't come together for me. I would have liked thicker sauce like red wine jus (well, that's more beef kind of thing but still) better, especially given the vegetable garnish that turned out to be pretty bland. Sausage platter - Just a sausage platter. I wasn't wowed, but I got what I expected. Given New York's reputation, I was kind of disappointed by this place. I would have liked to gone downstairs and tried some of those 20 kinds of cured meat with good red wine instead.",2,0,0,Wonhee P.,"Stanford, CA",163,113,77
4.0,8/10/2014,"Friend wanted to do their birthday here so that's how I ended up trying this place out. Located on top of Eataly, very cool rooftop place to hang during the day. Only beer I got to try was the Del Borgo Reale Extra (Italian IPA), very good though.The seating (provided you can get one) is quite spacious, so your claustrophobia won't act up. We did fairly good rundown through the menu. The portions are small so if you're going with a crew of heavy hitters, you will need to order a lot.Antipasti:Shittake Fritti - Very lightly battered and really quite delightful. This was one of my favorite things here. Good flavor and salted just right.Formaggi (7) and Affetati Misti - Good selection of meat/cheeses. Decent portions for what it is the quality you expect from Eataly. Not too much more to write for this.Secondi:Pollo alla Diavola - I just had to get the additional thigh. This was delicious, the chicken was juicy/moist. The lightly crisp skin with the puree, really tasty. If I come back, I'd probably just get this. Agnello - The lamb was a good cut and cooked perfectly. Taste-wise nothing was very memorable to me. I personally don't like mint either so, the mint pesto didn't do much for me.Probusto - Tasty sausage with a side of mustard. For $23 I would rather buy sausage downstairs though and make it at home. Contorni:Olive Oil Smashed Potatoes - I really enjoyed eating this. Yes, there's a lot of olive oil in it but that's all cool with me. Not chunky at all, really enjoyed going to town on this.Dessert:Panna Cotta - Very refreshing after the meat chow down. Light dessert, we ended up ordering another one because everyone liked it so much. Tiratu Su Classico - Reminded me a lot of a tiramisu glass. Just, really damn good. Nice and fluffy with the coffee soaked lady fingers. We ended up ordering another two because I kept ripping through them. A really cool place to check out if you find yourself in Eataly.

To get to the bar you have to walk through the very tourist populated Eataly which is interesting to browse but can get really overwhelmed with people.

Seating at La Birreria was actually one of the big pluses.  They have a lot of room in between tables, nothing feels overcrowded. They have a number of great beers on tap and the bus boys were the best wait staff there.

4.0,7/15/2014,"The awesome beer menu with a ton of interesting beers and the atmosphere are probably the best things about this place.  I was here this past Saturday for dinner with friends.  Even though it had been well over 80 degrees all day, none of us had any problems with it being too hot, and our table was in direct sunlight.  The rooftop vibe is great, though like other people have mentioned, it's not really a ""true"" rooftop as it is mostly enclosed.  Still, pretty great place to spend an evening with a group.The bar area was pretty packed when we got there as was the dining area.  Definitely make a reservation if you want to sit down and eat.  We had a 6:30 reservation and overheard that the wait was already an hour.  I also would recommend going on the earlier side.  People seem to linger here for a while (which is awesome, and you should absolutely linger if you come here) and I would imagine that later reservations may suffer somewhat because of this.The beer was great, I think the carafe is the best bang for your buck though there are a ton of unique beers on the menu.  The wine list is fairly limited, but I mean it's called La Birreria, not sure what else you would expect.  The food was also pretty good, though I actually think it's the low point for this place.  We split an appetizer as well as a couple of cheeses.  The cheeses were great, though portions are pretty small so next time I would order several if ordering for a group.  We all enjoyed our entrees a lot (fish, pork shoulder, steak, and Portobello mushrooms), but the portions were SO small if you have anything more than a small appetite.  Seriously, I know I have an above average appetite but we were all hungry a few hours after we left.  We actually ate again at a bar later that night.  I usually expect to feel like I want to unbutton my pants a bit after indulging at an Italian restaurant, but that was definitely not the case here.  I didn't mind the not feeling like I was going to barf, but I did mind spending a fair chunk of change on dinner and having to eat again a few hours later.All in all, a great place to go for a leisurely dinner with a fun group of people.  I would go back again, but maybe just for drinks and apps in the bar area next time.",5,1,0,Kelsey K.,"Coolidge Corner, Boston, MA",85,46,5

1.0,7/12/2014,"I went here just the other day. I wish I had read the reviews because I agree with everyone that pointed out the poor service and completely average food. The rule about having to order an entree to sit at a table is ridiculous-probably costing them money. We took a friend visiting the states here and I was mortified by the time we left at the experience and how our waitress chose to come after us when she felt her tip wasn't high enough...After having paid our bill and being fairly disappointed with the lackluster food/service, my friend and I went to the bathroom. As I come out of the stall I see the waitress yelling at my visiting friend. The blonde waitress was standing between my friend and the door and was being extremely confrontational-claiming she deserved a better tip than we left her. I'm pretty sure we left her a 15% tip. Which is average. She was average. She stopped at our table to take our order, drop off our food, and bring the check. (The busboy was very good however, constantly refilling the water and bring us extra bread). She never asked how anything was and she cast me a dirty look when I choose not to order a drink. I heard my friend mentioning the disappointing food/experience and the waitress firing back that that wasn't her problem and if she was needed we should have waved her down. I wish she had cornered me and not my friend because I would have reminded her tips are supposed to be earned and are meant to reward exceptional service. Given we went straight to the bathroom after we left- our waitress must have run to the table to inspect her tip and upon seeing it was not what she expected felt the need to pretend to wash her hands until one of us came out of our stalls. I've waited tables as well- I know how getting a small tip can be frustrating - but I don't believe she  chose the proper way to handle her frustration, nor do I think we left her a tip that warranted her actions.

I don't usually like sausage because I find the casing chewy and the mix salty. Birreria's sausage does not have this problem at all!  The turnips are the cutest vegetable I have ever seen.  Together, the vegetables and mustard complemented the sausage perfectly.  And washed down with a nice Sofia tap house whitbeir. The beer is just average, and probably not worth $10. My entree and beer came to $41.04 including tax and tip.  Worth. every. cent. I am a HUGE fan of outdoor dining. I was pleased to be able to stroll in with no reservations and grab a spot at the bar within minutes. I noticed 8 or so tables open as well, but it was 4pm, too early for even senior citizens.  Curious if it would be harder to snag a seat later in the day.

Cons: The rooftop dining area is enclosed, so you can't look over the side of the building to get a view of the fussy plebs down below. The food is kind of a mixed bag, and some of the chicken and steak were overcooked. Something extra is to be desired for the service. Bottom line: if you like rooftops and Eataly, you can do worse. This is ok. Disclaimer: We went here for a birthday party. We had 23 people so they gave us a special pre-fixe menu for $85. It had 3 appetizers, 4 entrees and 3 desserts. Therefore this review is probably not accurate for their regular dishes. For entrees, we had the hanger steak, swordfish, chicken and portobella mushrooms.",1,0,0,Vic-Crys W.,"New York, NY",12,74,58
4.0,7/1/2014,"Not a huge fan of the Eataly scene but the rooftop of Birreria sets itself apart from the ground floor restaurants. Nice spot to enjoy a couple of cold ones after a day's work. Although it may be difficult to find a seat at the bar at prime time, the eclectic selections of beer from around the world plus the intelligently designed bar and restaurant area make you feel right at home.

2.0,6/30/2014,"I was so excited to try Birreria but I would not recommend it to anyone.We had made a reservation for 8 but had to change at the last minute because a couple of people had cancelled but MAY be joining us later. The gentleman was very helpful (the only good service all night), and said he'd change our reservation to 6 so we could be seated but make a note that one or two people may be arriving late and we should have no troubles.When we got upstairs we had to repeat our story to the hostess upstairs. There was only three of us at that point and I was in the middle of saying we would just wait to the side for the other three when she informed to tell us, in a rather condescending manner, that she couldn't seat us until we were all present. In addition to this, we had a large bag and were asking if there was somewhere to leave it. We were informed that they had nowhere to keep it and that if we wanted to leave it, they could be responsible for it. Which is totally understandable, but we could have been told in a slightly less patronizing tone.When we were seated I tried to order a vodka soda and was informed they had run out of vodka. It was the day of the pride parade, so I took that and ordered a different drink. We then ordered our meals. Not even 2 minutes after we had placed our orders, one of our missing party showed up. Our server had come back with our drinks and we asked if it was ok for her to pull up a chair. He informed us that he would have to check with the hostess, as they usually didn't like that, but that he would check and it should be fine. Given that he was occupied serving our drinks, one of our part went to speak to the hostess himself. The hostess informed him that she could sit with us but, given that we had already placed our food orders, she wouldn't be able to order any food. Um, what? She was willing to accept her entree later than the rest of the table, and when my friend asked the hostess why she couldn't just order, was simply informed that ""they have a small kitchen"". I'm not entirely sure why that prevents them from taking an order, but hey....A few minutes later our server comes back to inform one of our party, who had ordered his steak cooked blue, that the chef couldn't do that. They could do rare, but not blue. I'm still a bit confused as to why they couldn't just sear the steak for 20 seconds on each side, but they could sear it for 40 seconds on each side.....Anyhow, our latecomer went to the bar to order and, on her way, proceeded to tell the hostess what she was doing. The hostess said ""well I guess that's away to get around it"" and said nothing more. So my friend placed her order at the bar with the bartender who also put up a fuss about her taking her food to another table because it ""wasn't allowed"". While she was placing her order our server comes over to inform us that the kitchen was closing (at 9:30) and did we want anymore food. We all responded with a resounding no.By this point I think our server had pretty much wiped his hands of us, and only came past one more time - with the check.So all in all the service was absolutely appalling. I would give them 1 star, except that the food wasn't awful. I was very disappointed that there was no pasta on the menu (though I could have saved myself that disappointment if I'd looked at the menu before arrival). We had a full tasting of cheeses and salamis to share as an appetizer and one of each of the main courses at our table, with two servings of the lamb. The cheeses were very mediocre. Not bad, but not great, and our sampling of ""seven salamis"" definitely only had 5 different types of cold cuts.Everyone else was very happy with their entrees, but both of us who had the lamb were disappointed. There was more fat than meat, what meat there was was undercooked and the escarole on my plate was wilted (dead, not cooked) and still dirty. At $23.00, I felt this was completely unacceptable.I would definitely not recommend.",1,0,0,Shaan B.,"New York, NY",0,9,0

Echoing most everyone else when I say that yes this is a ""rooftop"" bar, but there is no view, there is no outside seating area. It's a rooftop with a massive cover above it with a few pockets of space to give people the slightest impression that they are on a rooftop. Drinks were not too bad. First time trying beer that wasn't carbonated. But not worth the price ($10) for a medium sized glass. Looking at the menu, wine was also overpriced. I did not try the food or sit down, so I can't judge that part of the place, but the bar area was very limited and roped off, giving us no flexibility for moving around once we got our drinks.

2.0,6/22/2014,"This place had everything going for it-- rooftop, local beers, Italian fare. But it wound up being a flop, and disappointing on all fronts.First, the atmosphere. Yes, it was a rooftop bar... but there was no view, because of the high walls around the restaurant. Plus, with the sunroof open, it became SO hot, almost unbearable. Still, it was decently nice to be able to eat ""outside"", so I give one star for that.Then, the service... absolutely horrible. My boyfriend and I saw our waiter just twice, the beginning and end. He was very short with us, and rude. We tried to order cheese, and he quickly interrupted us to say we couldn't just ""start with the cheese"" because they had a ""small kitchen"" and needed a full order. Okay, a bit rude, but fine.So, when ordering the cheese plate, we only wanted five, but our waiter pushed us into getting 7, mostly so that he didn't need to answer any questions about choosing five cheeses. We both love cheese. But, the extra 2 added nothing, and honestly, none of the cheeses were particularly special. I actually enjoyed just two, one being just a giant spoonful of ricotta. It was served with honey, which wasn't bad. Also, after being served the cheese, we realized he had completely forgotten to give us bread (every other table around us had some)!! It took us 10 mins to finally grab someone's attention so that we could have some bread to eat the goopy ricotta. Our waiter never came to check on us. When we needed more bread since our main meal took forever, it took us another 15 mins to grab someone's attention. Such slow service!!Meanwhile, our drinks.. my white wine was okay. My boyfriend was not a fan of the cask ale he ordered, which just became an uncomfortably hot beer out in the sun.Then, the main course. My polenta and lamb was quite good. My boyfriend ordered a steak salad....which turned out to be a platter of cured steak pieces and mushrooms. No greens. Not really filling, although still delicious. That's perhaps just a bad choice, but in general, the menu descriptions were not all that helpful, and since our waiter was so terse with us (and seemed too rushed for questions), we couldn't have known otherwise. All in all-- okay food, nothing that exciting.Lastly, we needed the check.... that took another 15-20 mins. We finally got our waiter's attention, but he didn't come with the check for another 15 mins. At that point, we were so frustrated (and boiling in the sun) that we just paid with cash and left, which I normally do not do for pricier meals.So, not great. We felt unwelcome, underserved, and largely ignored. There was no excuse for the poor service... I saw plenty of waiters wandering occasionally with nothing to do.

We asked for just a little guidance. He returned, we ordered as quickly as we could. Not sure if it would be enough. Someone asked a question about a beer... He again was unable to answer and snarkily referred us to the menu. This is a BEER GARDEN! People might ask you questions about beer!

3.0,6/20/2014,"My very first time at Eataly (even though my college is only a few blocks away) was spent upstairs at the rooftop dinner and bar La Birreria! I love wine and I love rooftop bars, so I was excited to see that after scarfing down burgers and fries at Shake Shack, I could continue my night in a more grown up manner! Navigating through Eataly was a bit difficult as it was crowded. The main level contains all the special gourmet Italian market stuff. But I was here for the rooftop, which I quickly found thanks to a giant sign near the elevator. The elevator took us straight upstairs where we were greeted by a host. She informed us that tables were only available with dinner service. What a shame too. Because at the time we were there, most of the tables were empty but the bar area packed to the brim.My friends and I ordered a carafe of white wine and somehow (magically!!) found stools at the edge of the bar that overlooked the dining room where the ceiling was gone and the stars appeared. Okay, I'll stop being dramatic. It was cloudy and we people watched instead. But I had a good time at La Birreria and I wouldn't mind coming back again. It's less of a rooftop bar and more of a rooftop restaurant. Take my review with a grain of salt as I didn't actually eat here - I just drank here.

These bread would accompany the miserable 3 pieces of cheese (2 x1 inches each) that we ordered as a starter. I ordered the chilled prime rib beef ""salad"" appetizer ($17) also known in my world as a cooked carpaccio that was also not cold, seasoned or special in any way. One of my friends ordered the asparagus ""salad"" that was nothing more than a bunch of grilled asparagus with 2 dipping sauces ($14) and my other friend ordered the chicken entree that was greasy as hell dark meet, and somehow they managed to make the skin really crispy and the rest of the chicken undercooked. It was greasy and disgusting.

4.0,5/4/2014,"Birreria is a rooftop bar located on the top floor of Eataly, which is typically a market disgused as a madhouse for tourists and lovers of Italian everything. The rooftop restaurant itself is a quiet haven outside of Eataly, but very strangely accessible only via a set of elevators at the back of the store, followed by a flight of steps at the end of a long, windy corridor.It's either a godsend or a shame that Birreria isn't as crowded or as well-known as its ground-floor counterparts, because the food here is amazing -- I had a hanger steak with fingerling potatoes and a mustardy sauce, while my friend had swordfish with fava beans and asparagus. The service is impeccably polite and rest assured that they're knowledgable about their in-house beers. I'm not much of a drinker, but I've heard many people wax poetry about their beer selection so there you go.As many people have already commented, the prices are a bit on the steep side -- it's definitely a place where your wallet will twinge in misery. Having said that, the atmosphere is top-notch, with a retractable roof that offers fresh air and gorgeous views of the sky, which is something I don't see very often in NYC.Ultimately, Birreria is definitely worth at least one visit, by which you can decide for yourself whether it's worth the strange, windy trip back for a second taste.",2,0,0,Nicole L.,"Brooklyn, NY",102,554,5

I'm ashamed to admit that I didn't have any beer, just wine, but it was great--I had a white and two reds, both well priced (I believe they were the first name on each list). We also got a meat plate and it came out shortly after we ordered it and it was filling.

2.0,5/2/2014,"This review is for brunch.Interesting venue, but way too expensive and terrible service.I have lived in NYC for 10yrs now and should've have known better than to go to this tourist trap, but I didn't remember it being this bad.PROs:We are a group of 8 and we had a reservation and we only had to wait 10min, which was good / surprisingThe limited menu was very tastyCONs:Price - this place is so expensive for what it is, but you are paying I guess for the experience, even thought the views aren't really that greatService - our waiter was terrible. He was so slow in acknowledging us in the first place and then took FOREVER to get us drinks. It seemed like our presence was very annoying to him, which was not a great thing. We wanted to have another round of drinks after we finished the meal, but we were handed our check and told if we wanted to drink we would HAVE to go to the bar. After spending almost $200 per person, I thought that was really rude.Food - they have this POLICY there that you have to order all your appetizers and entrees together at once. They claim it's because they have a small kitchen, but we came to find out it's for another reason. They want to make sure EVERYONE at the table is getting an ENTREE or they kick you out. Even though they don't tell you that in advance when you make the reservation, you are NOT permitted to eat at the table unless everyone in your party gets an entree.  I just think that's insane, especially since we were drinking several bottle of wine.  And then to say it's because the kitchen is small is just very unprofessional.  So overall, if you have friends in town might be fun to get a drink here, but I wouldn't get a meal. Eat downstairs or go some place less touristy if you don't want to overpay.PS - if you are a professional with clients - DO NOT take them here, it's a recipe for embarrassment.",0,0,0,Mary T.,"New York, NY",5,70,0
2.0,5/2/2014,"I wanted to love this place, it has lots of elements that should add up to a fantastic experience but it missed the mark for me. So the good stuff first - the setting is amazing. Its technically a beer garden on the top floor of Eataly with a roof that they open in good weather. Yesterday was lovely so the roof was off meaning we were eating in the fresh air and had a gorgeous view of the sky. The atmosphere is great, there's a bar section on one side then the rest of the floor is the restaurant. This means you get the buzz of the people in the bar tempered with the slightly quieter murmurings from the restaurant. Its great, lively yet we felt like we were still having a private, discrete evening together. We ate a starter of 3 cheeses with honey and this was very delicious. Dan's main of pork shoulder on a coleslaw type base with apple in it was really lovely too. I wish I'd gone for that. Dan also ate and enjoyed the sprouts in soy and honey with pancetta. I wasn't as big a fan and I love sprouts usually.Now, sadly, the average/poor stuff. We were served by two people. One was surely and abrupt with us (the guy who brought out water, cutlery and starters) and the other was super friendly, in the way only Americans can be, yet seemed bored and annoyed she was there at all. The wine was ok, I had the Barolo (not the $141 Barolo, the other one!) and it was just ok. I'm spoilt for wine at the moment as I recently drank some bottles chosen by our friend and fellow yelp elite Nic, who is a wine expert. They were so good I now measure everything else I drink against them and nothing has matched up so far.When the cheeses were brought to us I was really disappointed by the presentation. It was literally a plate with 3 white blocks of cheese on it then a plate with honey on. The waiter plonked them down without saying a word, not even to tell us which cheese was which. Also a little garnish wouldn't have hurt. We ate a much better cheese board the night before at Clarkson with crackers and apple slices on and for a much more reasonable price. We also had some bread and oil, this was not as good as the bread we had just had downstairs in Manzo.My main was steak and it was very average, a little dry and I didn't enjoy the burnt taste of the outer crust. I also wasn't a fan of the asparagus we'd ordered as a side. It was overcooked and very soft. The service was getting slow at this point despite the restaurant getting quieter.Overall I had a good evening based on the ambience, surroundings, company and the two mouthfuls of pork shoulder I snagged off the Mr. I also really enjoyed the cheese but the presentation lets them down here. If you fancy eating here go for the pork its the far superior dish of the two mains we tried. Dan, an ardent hater of sprouts was also 'cured' (I come from a sprout loving family who were aghast when he confessed this dislike initially) by the sprout side dish so that's where the second star has come from really!",3,1,1,Jess F.,"Manchester, United Kingdom",79,148,789

The steaks were taken back and ""reheated"" (who reheats already sliced steak?) and were returned at room temperature. The fish was dry.The lamb chops were actually pretty good but also cold.Brussel sprouts were cold and unremarkable.The manager came over when she saw our dissatisfaction.

We decided since we had a big group and none of the entrees really jumped out at us to do a cheese sampler platter and the sausage sampler. Cheese were good. Came with lots of bread and honey. We added olives and fried mushrooms. Fried mushrooms were amazing. Sausages were good as well just kind of a random meal if you're not a huge meat eater. I liked the blood sausage the best.

The employees did absolutely nothing to help.After one final wind gust, we got up and moved tables.  I should note that at least 1/3 of the tables were empty at this point.  An employee came over and yelled at us for moving, and was incredibly rude.  She then got a manager who did not do more than listen or acknowledge the issue.I am pretty disappointed in this experience as the food was really quite delicious.  but the staff was rude to ambivalent at best.  Given the price points, we expected much more.",0,0,0,Janna G.,"New York, NY",92,26,6

4.0,4/3/2014,"A rooftop brewpub with walls like a greenhouse in downtown Manhattan? Yup, they've certainly got the location part down.Not much beats this place in terms of atmosphere and restaurant location. On the first floor is this massive Italian supermarket that also has a half-dozen small counters to buy freshly made food to eat at one of the numerous tables scattered about. I've never seen anything like it. Then again, I've never been to New York City before.The only problem is that Birreria is a little bit difficult to find. There's an elevator tucked into the back of the massive space if you know where to look, and I didn't, so it took several minutes of wandering. Maybe that's just how they whet your appetite?Once upstairs, the views are amazing, and the beer ain't bad either. They focus on cask ales freshly made (I believe on location) to provide the best flavor possibly. On my visit they had three of their own casks on tap - a Christmas ale, a thyme pale ale, and a chestnut brown ale. I was on an empty stomach and only tried the latter two, but both were fantastic. I give kudos to not overdoing anything and letting subtle complexities rule the beverage.While the menu looked tempting, I had my eyes set on another gourmet prize in town, so I did not partake. That will have to come another day.My only criticism would be that the bar area isn't big enough for the late afternoon work crowd. Much of the restaurant was empty while the seats at the bar and standing room was densely populated. I'm sure that ratio flips during dining hours, however, so that criticism doesn't have much to stand on.",1,0,1,Ken K.,"Chapel Hill, NC",32,225,0
1.0,4/2/2014,"I only gave the Birreria one star because I cannot give it none. A group of medical school friends and I tried to go for afternoon beers and appetizers while we worked out some plans for an upcoming trip. A few of our friends arrived early to make a ""reservation"" for our party at an estimated time when everyone would be there. Half of our party heads up the elevators to the bar to grab a beer while they wait. The second half arrive and they tell us there was a 30 min wait. That's fine, it happens in NYC of Saturday afternoons around 3-4 pm. But what about our reservation? Our wait time ends up being an over an hour, also not a big deal. Time estimates are often wrong too. However, they told us the ""bar"" was to capacity so people were not allowed up unless they were being seated at a table, according to one of the two hostesses downstairs. Okay... So we had to wait the hour plus down stairs in the shopping area while we watched people constantly going up the elevators to ""just go to the bar."" When we asked if we could ""just go up to the bar"" and meet our friends who were at the bar, we were told no because we have a reservation. I'm lost? So I need to wait down here instead of spending money at the bar?We get to our table a few minutes before 5 pm.Keep in mind we have been waiting with our ""reservation"" since before 4 pm. Our waitress casually strolls over after sitting there for about 15-20 minutes and hands us the menus. At this time it's well after 5 pm. The waitress takes our beer order but refuses to take our food order until we ""order for the entire table."" Apparently, after 5 pm the tables in the dining room require that each seated person order a full entree. This would have been nice to know when we made our ""reservation"", right? We weren't interested in eating dinner and just wanted one of each appetizer for the table and drinks. The waitress, in a tizzy, keeps telling us she will come back when we are ready to order. This happened about 3 times before she explained this ""rule"" to us. Long story short she goes to 2 other waiters and eventually a ""manager"" to tell them we weren't ordering food. The manager, dressed in a wrinkled, faded, green polo and dingy looking blue jeans walks over to the table and immediately raises his voice and tells us it's company policy that we have to order food if we want to sit down. We tried to explain to him that wasn't said when we made our ""reservation"" which was over an hour and a half ago at this point. He then claims that two hostesses told him they told people in our party of this rule and we were liars. He then tells us we need to immediately finish our drinks and leave. We asked if we could just move to the bar then but were told it's at capacity. Seriously?We sat there in shock. The group and I were flabbergasted that a ""manager"" would speak to us that way then ask us to leave. He was verbally attacking us, calling us liars, and raising his voice all while speaking in a condescending tone. In the amount of time the waitress wasted coming back to our table for our order and tattling on us to everyone who worked there the five of us would have racked up a substantial tab with beers and appetizers equal to a dinner tab.

4.0,3/29/2014,"This was kind of a spur of the moment decision that my cousin and I made to come here for lunch. I had wanted to check out eataly anyways and we had beaten the lunch crowd by getting there around 11. They were able to seat us right away and I loved the atmosphere of the place. Brightly lit, greenery on the wall and we had a pretty friendly server too! We ended up splitting a kale salad and the lamb chops and they were both fantastic.The kale salad was massaged with an anchovy vinaigrette and topped with fresh grapefruit, pomegranate seeds and a crispy poppy-seed cheese cracker. I love kale to begin with, but this salad blew away me expectations. I'm not a huge fish person so anchovy flavored dressing didn't sound very appetizing to me, but the salty,smoked flavor worked so well with the fresh citrus of the grapefruit and the crunch of the pomegranate seeds. I would go to this place again just to eat this salad. For our main course, my cousin and I split the lamb chops. They were perfectly cooked and had very tender meat. I think the only improvement I would suggest would be for it to be served with different greens and I really appreciate a grilled crust on my lamb to contrast with a tender inner portion. It was still really really delicious though! The table next to us ordered the exact same thing that we did, both salad and main course so it must've looked good to them too ! :)We opted out of dessert as there was a very tempting gelato store in eataly downstairs, but I'm sure whatever they offer would be delicious.  Definitely try the place if you can, it's a neat ambiance and you're not quite as packed together for eating like other places in Eataly can be.

4.0,3/17/2014,"Tourist review: Went to NYC for a long weekend, and several friends (locals) took us around throughout our stay. One friend met us after church at St. Pat's and he took us to Eataly. We walked a couple of blocks to the train and he was asking how our trip was thus far. We mentioned we visited Chelsea Market the day before, so he probably thought we would like this place... And we did!!! I was hankering for some coffee so I almost stopped at the espresso bar near the entrance but I wanted to use the restroom first. So he walked us towards the back of the building.  When I came out of the bathroom he left us to check on something. While we waited, we looked around at the foods for sale, and people- watched at those brunching at the various eateries. When he came back, he led us further back to an elevator. When we reached the top, we walked up a flight of stairs and reached our chill spot, La Birreria. They serve coffee here? Yes, I was assured. Because it was pretty early, we were seated right away. I loved the airy atmosphere as soon as we walked in. The rooftop was not open, but the light came through the glass roof. When our waiter came by, I asked for coffee and he brought a separate menu. I was fine with the drip coffee (Lavazza), which is a favorite of mine. We ordered the appetizer meat sampler & 3 cheeses (I took the waiter's suggestion for the most popular selections). The service we had was better than other reviewers had experienced... We got refills of bread, water and coffee as soon as we asked.  Maybe it was the time of day since it was not so busy. We didn't order anything heavier because we already had lunch plans. It was definitely a great spot to hang out and catch up with friends.

It was extremely busy, as you'd expect. No problem.  The person downstairs asked my partner and I if we'd be eating. We said yes, as we planned to order food. We were put on the wait list for a table.The good: very busy at the bar, but got a couple beers and struck up a lovely conversation with a former Massachusetts guy because my wife was wearing a Celtics sweatshirt. Great beer as always.After 45 minutes, we got a table for two. We did just what we've done several other times: ordered a couple  more beers, as well as three cheeses ($11) and a full selection of meats ($21).  With just one beer each (at the table), the bill would total nearly $50. We were told that we needed to at least split an entree or order a salad. This made no sense, as we were ordering a lot of food. We ended up just ordering the extra $9 salad to avoid walking out. Our server was gracious , sort of, but said she was the messenger. Meanwhile, we decided not to stay for more drinks.I love the atmosphere, beer, and charcuterie. But they can't draw lines like this:  expensive charcuterie alone - no good; entree - ok. Especially given their limited entrees. Food  for a table or no food for no table -  that's the professional thing, regardless of how in demand your seats are. Cause they're not going to be in demand for long with that kind of attitude.",0,0,0,Laura K.,"Boston, MA",18,4,0
4.0,3/17/2014,"Came here on Saturday afternoon with a couple of friends for food and drinks after the Knick game.  The whole experience of La Birreria is pretty cool.  It all starts with an elevator ride to the rooftop where you are met with a massive bar, skyline, and fresh air (it happened to be a nice march day so the retractable roof was open). An hour wait for a table meant plenty of time to check out the bar. The beer list is extensive and I would have loved to try a bunch of them, but the bar was packed and the bartenders were busy so I stuck with the DFH brews I know and love.  After an hour or so we sat down to eat.  The food left much to be desired.  The cheese board was OK (we tried all 7) and the pork shoulder was tasty but not memorable.  Our waiter acted like he hated his life and job, but he couldn't break our spirits. We were just loving the sun and drinks outdoors.

3.0,3/14/2014,"My group and I had a bipolar experience at La Birreria. On one hand, it was the perfect way to spend a gorgeous Saturday afternoon with 15 of our far-flung friends from all corners of the country who converged on New York for a surprise weekend. On the other hand, a particular waiter needs some deep-seeded training in etiquette and finesse and nearly caused us to cut our five hour stay at LB extremely short.The Good:The suns aligned for a perfect Saturday afternoon to spend on a rooftop. Our city's Eataly has no rooftop, so of course we made a beeline to soak up the sun whilst dining on excruciatingly delightful cheese and meats. The area is scattered with comfortable tables and chairs, lattice work sections off the bar from the dining area, and the views are exceptional. I loved staring at the Flatiron Building and making up superbly corny jokes to bring home (I stood next to the FlatIron Building for an hour and my hair didn't straighten one bit!). The Mister and I arrived super early so we parked it at the bar where we were treated to attentive and kind bartenders, a bevvy of bevs, and delightfully charming New Yorkers who were a blast to chat with. No for real, that happened. I was surprised, too. I had plenty of the Flor Rose, which was a crisp, mild, fruity white wine that paired perfectly with LB's atmosphere.  We were told we had to wait until the rest of our party of 12 arrived before we could be seated, but that's cool. More time at the bar with the New Yorkers. Then It Started Going Downhill...Once our party arrived, we waited an hour for our table to be ready, even though we had put our reservation in two hours prior. I get that it was slammed and they had other customers to serve, and if that had been the only mishap, I probably wouldn't even mention it. But then we were seated and our derelict of a waiter came by. He was unamused at our style of ordering, which was a lot of wine, beer, cheese boards and charcuterie boards. He had a problem with us not ordering entrees. For real, bro? We're dropping more than a grand at your table, and you want us to order a freaking sandwich to make you happy? Get the eff out of here. He began arguing with our friends over what we should be ordering to validate sitting in the dining section. STFU. I was throwing on my sunnies and jacket and ready to bounce, but my more rational friends asked for a different (ahem, nicer) waiter who was willing to serve us. After that fiasco ended, we had a fabulous girl take our orders who appreciated our business and had no problem serving cheese and wine and receiving our tip. But honestly, the nerve of that joker! Had I known Attila the Hun's brother would have been trying to serve us I would have stayed at the bar. If I'm in New York again on a warm day, I'd love to come back to LB, but I'm sticking to the bar.",3,4,2,Sarah V.,"Chicago, IL",774,432,164

LOVED the ricotta with honey and hazelnuts on their fresh bread. My mouth is watering just thinking of it. I split the lamb shanks and it an order of olive oil smashes potatoes. The potatoes were light, fluffy, and you could really taste the high quality fruitiness of the EVOP. Big fan. The lamb was cooked to perfection. So happy with that meal.

5.0,3/9/2014,"What a glorious experience on a magnificent afternoon! It's been brutally cold for far too long, and even though I honestly love winter and snow, enough if enough already. The first really nice day in a really long time, this is precisely what my spirit needed. What's better than a massive, sun-drenched, breezy rooftop beer garden with food? Excellent beer and excellent food, no less! Although it was definitely a predicament making it through the masses downstairs, the hoards waiting in line, and the throngs waiting around the bar, once we were actually sat down, we were all beyond contentWe started with Flip, Gina, and Wanda (which we all agreed was the best).. Then we had Affettati Misti (a selection of salumi), which was terrific (especially the Coppa and Soppresata). They gave us bread and olive oil, which were delectable. Piatto Misto (recommended for five people, but we split it among us three) and even though everything was absolutely incredible (especially the Pork Shoulder and Blood Sausage), what really stood out were the Contorni -- the Brussels Sprouts and Olive Oil Smashed Potatoes and Roasted Baby Carrots were all sensational! Even the Mustard they gave us was incredible! A bottle of Dogfish Head Sah'tea (spectacular), a couple glasses of Dogfish Head Olde School Barleywine (phenomenal), and a lovely Rice Sponge Cake finished off an extremely memorable, stupendous meal.I would love to return here regularly, but could definitely see the whole process of getting a table as rather cumbersome. A few suggestions: make reservations at least the day before (no same-day accepted), enter on 23rd street (it's a massive trek from 5th avenue, all things considered), make sure the sound on your phone is turned on (so you can hear when they text you once your table is ready), arrive early or late...

2.0,2/4/2014,"The space and presentation of Eataly is very overwhelming in a good way.  There is so much to look at and so much to try, but our party of 8 people had plans to eat at La Birreria.  I've had better service at a truckstop in podunktown, tennessee, and there were maybe 7 tables occupied in the whole restaurant.Our server: - haphazardly put our wine and beer down right in front of us in a rushed fashion.- brought the entrees out with the salads- forgot to bring the entrees out later for those who sent theirs back to the kitchen to keep warm while they ate their salads.  So they ate their entrees after everyone else was finished.  One of the people who received their entree incredibly late had a food allergy, which was not accommodated for, so she wasn't able to eat most of her food.- ran his hand through his hair several times- when one person wanted to pay for the whole table and I wanted to split my beer into a separate check, the server said, ""Hmmmm let's see... complicated or easy?  I think I'll go with the easy way.""  Oh, I'm sorry server... I didn't realize we were inconveniencing you.- when I insisted he split up my beer, he quite literally slammed the credit card back on the table and said ""Whenever you guys figure it out, let me know.""How this guy got a job outside of McDonald's is beyond me, but with that kind of service, I will not return to Eataly.  This is one of those situations where the automatic gratuities should be removed from a check, because that 20% needs to be earned, automatically added or not.  If I had been the host of the party, the manager would have been notified of the evening, but out of respect for the host I didn't raise a fuss there.",0,0,0,Joshua S.,"Bowling Green, KY",4,74,5

It was served in a glass more akin to a wine glass, which I really liked because the glass was clearly high quality - I don't know if these sort of things make the drink taste better, but it certainly felt classier.The one downside was that the view was practically non-existant at night. I haven't been there during the summer so I don't know if it is laid out differently, but the bar area is confined to the left side, while the main dining area actually goes out more (where they could conceivably have a view).

It's still lovely in the winter, though, as it's less crowded, usually, and toasty warm. The beer selection is impressive. I wish I did a better job at remembering which beers I tried. I haven't yet enjoyed anything in the barrels (casks?), instead ordering 750 mL bottles to share. Everything I've had has been very good. The bartenders have helped me find something on the list of new-to-me names and brews based on what I like and have never steered me wrong. A perk of grabbing a beer here over a lot of other places is the free bread and olive oil. It's not quite as good as chips and salsa, but free is free!I've ordered the ""pick your own cheese"" plate with good results, but unfortunately for me, haven't sampled anything else off the menu. Overall I think this place deserves to be on any beer loving tourists list (I feel a little bad asking tourists to show up at one of my go-to spots) but it's first and foremost a good spot for a date or a night with friends for locals (or, for killing time while you wait for your table downstairs).",1,1,1,Brittany J.,"New York, NY",31,211,11

For example, on my most recent visit, our waiter rarely showed up, compelling us to snag a different waiter to take our order. Even once the waiter for our section did show his face, it was extremely infrequent, leaving us hanging for more than 20 minutes just trying to pay the bill.

Truly amazing. It was crispy on the outside and soo tender on the inside and with an outstanding sauce and glaze. I never imagined it could be this good!The skirt steak was excellent too; cooked perfectly but had no other strong sauces - it was a well prepared steak, very delish.The lunch came out to be $90 since the pork and steak were about $23 each, the cheeses $11 for 3 and the beers about $8 each.

It is a really cool rooftop space with nice views, which unfortunately look like they are being somewhat obstructed by construction. Beyond that it is covered so it doesn't have to be perfect weather outside. The waitstaff is friendly and there is an actual little brewery up there. The first place I have seen Dogfish Punkin on tap, and lots of wine choices. You can get snacks even if you are at the bar  but it's a pretty large space. Still, you would push your luck to try to come here primetime in the summer (could not get in a Friday at 6pm) but went to the bar pretty easily a little later in the evening.

3.0,11/9/2013,"Rooftop (enclosed when we went, can be opened in better weather) bar above Eataly, this location was packed when we went. The signs inside Eataly aren't too clear, but when you find the entry to the elevator, you'll be greeted by the hostess there and if your group is complete, will go upstairs to be seated, or if you're just hitting the bar, will send you up.A second elevator has to take you up once you reach the top of the first elevator (this was apparently an elevated area built after the original elevators were set up) or you can take the stairs. Kegs tapped line the entryway and another host will direct you to seats or the bar.The bar itself was crowded - people sitting there made it tough to order over them with the two really busy bartenders. Many home brewed beers and wines on the wooden kegs behind the bar, and they have Wanda and other custom brews.I tried the Game of Thrones Ommegang - dark black and slightly bitter but that strength that you would expect. Also tried the ancient ale of honey flavor - tasty and strong (10% abv).The food - mixed cheeses & meat platters were rather light on the portions, and they don't leave the olive oil on the table for you, but were a good start to the meal. The main recommendation was either the lamb (three pieces,which was good, but too salty) and the shoulder (which was soft and excellent). The desserts... meh. Not even a simple sorbet or gelato to wash the richness of the cheese/meat/wine down afterwards. Ah, well.Service could take a while... again, could be a function of being busy, but getting a beer refill or extra bread, etc. took a while. They were very helpful when available.Overall a mixed experience.. had better food, and would've loved to see more of the stars, but it was a fun place to try some different beers and chill with friends.

4.0,9/30/2013,"Eataly's rooftop beer bar is a lovely space complementing their other restaurants down below.  Find its entrance at the host stand located aptly by the beer section, and take an elevator up.  The bar area is on one side, with plenty of tables elsewhere.  There's standing room on the bar side but as a whole, Birreria isn't meant to hold crowds of standing imbibers and the number of people allowed in is controlled.  Built to respond to the whimsy of weather, there are retractable tarps for shade and glass panels for rain.  Mobbed by the lines and crowds below, we were surprised to find plenty of space in La Birreria on an overcast, drizzling Saturday afternoon, probably precisely for that reason.  Despite the weather, it was a gorgeous space: bright, spacious, with great views of sky and skyscrapers.Service was friendly, but can be scarce; then again, as a bar, one doesn't expect service to hover and guests may be expected to linger.  The food options are concise, limited to foods that accompany drinks well, but also mined from the types of foods sold in Eataly itself.  There are excellent salumi and cheese selections, the latter accompanied by good honey.  Also salads, grilled dishes, house sausages, vegetable sides, and mushrooms.  Among the latter options was a dish of roasted maitake, oyster, and white beech mushrooms, encircled by young pea shoots and topped by fresh burrata.  Earthy, savory, and smooth.Their fantastic beer selection led to unabashed lusting by a few craft beer fanatics at the table.  Between a trio of house-conditioned cask ales, ten drafts, and a few dozen bottles, there is much to choose from.  And the selection is eccentric, with a lot of spices, fruits, and herb flavors featured, as well as a good number of Italian imports.  Served in their Birreria Teku glass, designed to allow optimal appreciation of aroma, appearance, and tasting of most beer styles.  My appreciation is not yet so sophisticated, but it seems to work as well as the tulip glass I typically use.Another gem among craft beer destinations, and a great rooftop drinking option.  Not economical, but this is Eataly so anyone who's taken a gander at the prices on display below has no business expecting differently up here.",1,1,1,Valery C.,"Forest Hills, NY",56,837,9616

You could tell this was his day job. He displayed no passion for the job, the business or most importantly the customer. I don't understand, I want to give you my money, and I drink a lot. How does that not deserve a two bite check in? Also, I think he forgot that we hadn't ordered yet so we had to flag him down after about 15 minutes to get his attention. Very strange.

I really would like to rate Birreria more than 3 stars, but I think it's just a bit overpriced for what they offer. The $10 pints of their (amazing sounding!) beer brewed right there on the roof are lacking in flavor and character, and the menu is quite limited as compared to the other restaurants within Eataly.That said, the girlfriend and I went there a few weeks back with some friends from VA and they absolutely LOVED it. We got the family-style meal for 5 (although we only had 4 people; we were all stuffed).All in all, good, but if they either dropped their beer price to better line up with the quality they produce, or increase the quality to match the price they'd be dead on for a 4-star rating in my book.",0,0,0,Steve A.,"Boonton, NJ",105,216,57

2.0,9/14/2013,"Where to begin with this place. Well, I want to love it due to the fact that it combines small plates and good beer. But, since coming here on opening night and waiting 2 hours, now coming back years later, this place leaves a lot to be determined. First and foremost, they told us it would be a 45min - 1hr wait on a Friday night which we said, ""Ok, we'll go wait at another one of YOUR bars."" As soon as we stood at another spot and ordered a drink + app, our phone buzzed that our table was ready. I texted back (but got no response) and quickly got our check. $70 later (for two people), we were told that our food and drinks could NOT come up to the restaurant with us. So, we were forced to throw away our $70 order or lose our table (nice management tactics here). There was no management in sight, no oversight, no care for customer concerns. Then, there was the meal. The waiter was unaware when our drinks were low. Our sides came 10-min after the main dishes, the food itself was average, and everything was overpriced. And, the best part, the BEER. It was basic, nothing special. A few ordinary casks that were unimpressive and a basic tap list without seasonals/specials. The bottle list was small and mostly from the owners of this place and drastically overpriced, even for Manhattan. My advice, stay away. Go to a local spot. You'll get a more authentic meal at a more reasonable price.",0,0,0,Erick B.,"WHITESTONE, NY",0,21,0

4.0,9/3/2013,"A bit conflicted whether to give this place 3 or 4 stars but whatever...feeling generous today.Beer selection here is pretty expansive as they have a bunch of kegs just in the background filled with beer. My friend thought it was filled with wine which was funny given that this is a beer garden.I think the beers here are a bit hit or miss. The Italian Pale Ale and the Amber Ale here are both pretty good here. Some of the beers here taste a bit watered down though for some reason.If you are just coming here for beer, just be warned that the bar area is effing small and crowded. You literally feel like you are in the masses in China when either ordering a drink or just sipping on one.This past weekend, A couple of my friends and I sat down for food as well. We got the 5 for $15 cheese plate. Got the asiago fresco, robiola sosina, provolone mandarone, taleggio, and gorgonzola dolce. These cheeses were all effing good. I usually like soft cheeses like Brie and camembert but the gorgonzola and the asiago fresco, despite being on the firmer side, had exceptional taste. Now I only wish I had wine to down the cheese with instead of beer....but fear not because we also got the prosciutto as an appetizer. You get some bigass slices of prosciutto and it tasted super fresh.Now come's the disappointing part of my review :(. For our main we got the pork shoulder/sausage sampler for 5 that came along with 3 side dishes. I'll start with the sides. The mashed potatoes were good. It's not super mashed and more on the chunky side and the chive garnish on top is a nice finish. The radish with honey glazed kale is great! kale is good and kale with honey is even better! The broccoli rabe was good too.Unfortunately I wasn't such a huge fan of the pork shoulder/sausage sampler. I liked the cotechino the best. The probusto was ok but there have been better sausage links. The biroldo was something that I haven't tried before so I appreciated the uniqueness of the blood sausage but the taste gets old after the first bite. And finally we have the pork shoulder...I wish this was cooked a bit more tenderly. When I first saw the pork shoulder it made me sad that it was a bit stiff. The times I've had pork shoulder at chinese restaurants and momofuku ssam bar  it was so tender and delicious and I just did not get that from this pork shoulder.One of my friends did know the manager though so we got complimentary desserts so we got the tiramisu and some peanut based dessert I think?

Just say okay - they'll take your phone number and text you when your table is available. It doesn't matter - everything available at this extremely busy bar is also what is served for dinner anyway. Take the elevator up to the 14th floor, then walk up one flight to the fifteenth. Finally, you've made it!Food: any food order comes with free bread and olive oil! I recommend the pork shoulder and the beef & pork combination sausage. The beers are always so interesting. The wines, too! They change every month or so - any recommendation I write now may be stale by next week.Service: honestly, they are great, but they take too long because they're so busy. This venue is a victim of its own success in this regard and therefore loses one star because of it. Crowd control isn't that great, either, but most people are classy and sociable. Decor: This is apparently New York City's highest brewery. It has a retractable roof and is gorgeous during cool summer evenings. It's probably worth it just to come for the ambiance. I shall return again. This was my third visit (at least).",4,3,4,Marcus C.,"Fresh Meadows, NY",820,586,1284

Sharing some appetizers while drinking excellent beer is always a win, and this time was no different. Work up an appetite while exploring the myriad of amazing foods in the grocery below, then head up the elevator to the roof.

A friend and I had a reservation for an early dinner on a Friday and we ordered a bottle of wine with the Italian meat plate for 2 and a cheese plate. We weren't interested in having a big meal and if it wasn't enough we were thinking of ordering another appetizer to share. Five minutes after we ordered the manager came over to our table and told us that when we were done with our drinks that we would have to leave and couldn't order more rounds of drinks because we hadn't ordered enough food. She went on to explain that she had to say this to many patrons that night and that this wasn't a beer garden where you can just sit an enjoy your drinks/food all night. We were so appalled by such behavior from a restaurant manager at a respected place that we cancelled our food order and left. The manager was beyond rude, and it is obvious that this place doesn't care much about keeping their customers - I guess the tourist industry will keep them busy. The beer here is great, the food is just okay and comes with attitude so my recommendation is to come here only to drink - but be careful, don't stay too long because they'll ask you to leave!",0,0,0,Tracie D.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,4,0

We were told the wait would be 45 minutes, but they ended up calling us in 5 minutes. Not sure if this was unusually fast, but when we were seated we noticed plenty of empty tables.As for the food, the only reason I did not give it 5 stars was that each entree was at least $20, so this place isn't the cheapest, considering the quality. All the food we had was good, but so are a lot of other restaurants that offer cheaper options.However, the most amazing part of our experience here was the PORK SHOULDER. You MUST get it. It was so soft and tender - so sublime. Definitely worth the $23 or so. With respect to the beer - I don't drink beer, so I can't comment on it.

3.0,7/23/2013,"Why Come Here? Rooftop dining with a selection of beers you won't find anywhere elseRight Amount for 2? 2 EntreesBirreria is a year round open-air eating/drinking space on the roof of Mario Batali's gastrotemple/tourist-trap known as Eataly. But what kind of place Birreria is supposed to be exactly baffled me when I visited. Is it a restaurant with a layout and selection of ales and food typically found at a beer garden? Or is it a beer garden with a large, waiter-service and entrees required- dining section? Regardless of which you're looking for, you'll likely find yourself left with something to be desired at Birreria.For those in search of a beer garden, there is a lengthy selection of cask ales brewed onsite as well as many unusual (albeit pricey) German and Belgian style saisons and ales.  This includes my first foray into Ancient Ales - those which use ancient brewing recipes and are aged in very old barrels. You're not alone if you think that sounds more like a marketing gimmick than sound brewing technique, although the one our waiter recommended was quite complex and flavorful (I highly recommend using the knowledgeable staff to navigate the beer list) But before you get too excited about trying ancient and rare brews, note the space reserved for those who are ""just drinking"" is about 20% of the total area and perpetually packed (often with waits up to an hour). If you wish to enjoy the rest of the space, you must be seated with waiter service and order at least one entree per person.This last bit may lead you to believe Birreria is more restaurant than beer garden. To be fair, the Eataly website refers to it as a ""rooftop restaurant and brewery."" Which is all well and good until you see the limited ""drinking food"" menu of meats, cheeses, salads with a small selection of very heavy entrees like pork shoulder and $20 sausages. To put it simply, it's not the type of food you want to make a meal out of often unless you're going down the suicide-by-heart-attack route. Which is really too bad because the space and beer selection make it a place I'd like to visit more often. But at least for now Mario doesn't need a bunch of regulars on his roof. He's doing a fine job packing it with every tourist in New York.Cheese Plate (1/4 stars) The selection is pretty uninspired given the large cheese department downstairs. Taleggio, Parmigiano and Gorgonzola were all fine though if you're in the mood.Portabello (1/4 stars) The burrata and candied apricots sold this one for me. But the earthy portabello didn't seem to be the right compliment for it's sweet and salty friends. Then again, I remembered I don't love portabellos to begin with.Pork Shoulder (3/4 stars) Braised in beer and apricot this was a winner. Hearty, melt in your mouth shoulder gets a kick from brown mustard and then is cooled by an apple and celery slaw. Order with confidence.",0,0,0,Jay Z.,"Manhattan, NY",156,126,0
4.0,7/21/2013,"It seems as though this place has gotten a mixed bag of reviews. I will preface my review with the following: We only came here for the beer, so this will only be about that. My friend R, an avid homebrewer and beer nerd, came to town a few weeks ago, and I knew we had to come here. We went early on a weekday afternoon, around 4-ish or so, and were told we could go right up after letting them know we were only going to be drinking. We took the elevator, said the same to the hosts and hostesses at the stand by the door, and walked inside to the bar. The bar is to the left and tables to the right. In addition to the actual bar space, there is a small sliver of counter in which to rest a beer, as well as a few high-top tables. We were fortunate enough to get a table. There is a small selection of regular craft beer on tap, such as Captain Lawrence and Dogfish Head - the latter is expected, as Sam Calagione (the owner/brewer) collaborates with the guys from Birra Baladin and Birra del Borgo (a favorite). However, the cask ales are the ones worth seeking. Yes, they are $10 a pop, but you get a full pour (none of that 8 oz stuff), they're cask ales, and they are only available at La Birreria. We tried all three - Wanda, Gina, and Rosamaria - and they were all very complex, with ingredients the average person might not think of with respect to beer (thyme, rosemary, chestnuts, etc). We enjoyed all three.For all you wine lovers, the selection is also very good, and you will find something you'll like. The bar was busy but not overwhelmed; we had no problems with the service. If you swear by boxed wine, wine coolers, or think Blue Moon is an awesome craft beer, then La Birreria may indeed seem like an overpriced waste of space. However, if you are appreciative of the brewing/wine-making process, are getting into the craft beer scene, or are an oenophile, then this is a place I highly recommend - go at the right time after lunch/before dinner, and I think you will agree.",3,2,3,Denise C.,"Jersey City, NJ",243,275,61
3.0,7/18/2013,"I went for after work drinks and dinner with four other girls. Loved the outdoor ambiance even though we decided to go on a 90+ degree day, the 5 geniuses that we are. Definitely could have used some more fans around the place but we still had fun and it was a nice space. However considering that it's a rooftop, I was disappointed in the views or lack thereof.Overall I'd say the food we tried at Birreria was really very good but overpriced. I know it's NYC but I felt this was more overpriced than usual NYC...considering the small portion sizes and just the kind of place it is. Food selection may be limited but there's no shortage of alcohol options. Loved the wines we tried (especially the sparkling rose!) and definitely want to come back to try some of the beers! If I come back it will be mainly for drinks and perhaps a few plates to share...but not when I want it to actually be my dinner. I just don't see it as that kind of place, which begs the question: why the entree-heavy menu? 5 or 6 entrees may not seem like a lot but it is when the menu is tiny.  I'm just really not sure what identity they're going for. In my opinion, offering more small plates would be the way to go. They could even deconstruct some of their existing entrees into small plates.  Birreria is just not the kind of place/menu from which I would ever order an entree again (delicious as it was- I got the pork shoulder). Maybe drinks and snacks like cheese and bread and  the yummy olive oil smashed potatoes, but definitely not dinner.

We ordered the rose which tasted fine. The cheese plate was great mostly because it was very hot outside, so the cheese became melty - I tend to like soft cheeses. The lamb was delicious, if not a little too fatty.Overall we stayed up here for almost three hours chatting and the servers didn't bother us. It probably wasn't 100% full because it was an open roof and therefore really hot up there if you weren't lucky enough to be under the shade of an umbrella (it was over 95F that day).If you're looking for a casual rooftop to hang out with friends on over the summer, Birreria is a good pick.

They also get extremely offended at anyone trying to slip in to grab drinks.The crowd is a mix of tourists and local douchebagery. The food, however, is worth the visit. We ordered their mixed cured meat plate (4/5) and a selection of three cheeses. It's a shame they don't have a meat and cheese plate because that would be the best of both worlds.The pork shoulder was amazing (5/5). It was juicy, tender, and worth another future visit. The sea bass special (3/5) was a little overcooked but I could sense the greatness that could have been. ___July '12 Health Score - A",1,2,1,Dennis L.,"Redondo Beach, CA",287,503,84
4.0,5/27/2013,"Went there this past Saturday with my wife and what a great experience. Made reservations which I highly recommend so we only waited about 5 minutes.  The weather was gorgeous the skies were as blue as can be which serves great for a roof-top bar.      The wine and beer selection goes on and on, we drank a bottle of prosecco with our meat (sopresata, mortadella, coppa) and cheese platter (ricotta, provolone, mozzarella), with marinated olives, which was just amazing.    For dinner she got the shirt steak medium, which was excellent with the broccoli rabe (super spicy).  I had the lamb chops which came out medium rare and had a pesto mint sauce on them which were to die for; they came with smashed potatoes which I didn't like too much because it was extremely oily.     Dessert I had a double espresso which was very strong which I enjoy, and she had, the panna cotta which was light and creamy, could have axed out the caramel sauce on the bottom.     Overall the experience was great waitress, bus boy and staff did a great job, a definite to go back.",0,0,0,David C.,"Bayonne, NJ",1,7,12
4.0,5/25/2013,"This rooftop bar is the epitome of badass. Came here a few years ago on a Thursday at 11:30. We beat the lunch crowd by 15 minutes--meaning we had practically the entire rooftop to ourselves before it crowded up.Cheese platter was the best thing I ever ate. The ricotta was my favorite; you can go downstairs to buy a tub after. I recommend you do, because nothing from the grocery store can compete. Sprinkle a little bit of sugar on top and it is THE BEST dessert you can imagine.Beer was ok, though I'm not really a beer fan so that explains it. They make their own stuff; enjoyed all the cases as I walked upstairs. My mom ordered a lighter colored beer. Mine was darker, and I didn't listen to my waiter who suggested another since I was iffy about beers to begin with. The idea of a chestnut flavoring in a beer was too intriguing to pass up. My mistake.We both got the steak dish. Meat was good, but it was the pesto-y sauce thing underneath (it's been a few years, sorry!) that totally rounded out the dish and made it memorable.Pity that most of the options on the menu are for meat eaters. The rooftop view was great.",2,2,4,Tori N.,"Richmond, VA",270,153,55
3.0,5/25/2013,"Birreria impressed me, not because it was amazing but because I was convinced it was going to be a scene, and it ended up being a pleasant dining and drinking experience, and not as expensive as I feared it would be. While the pork shoulder and sides were good, the real standouts were the fried mushrooms and the cheeses. Snacking on that while drinking good beers makes for a great evening.

1.0,5/23/2013,"One of the worst experiences I've ever had in NYC. We arrived at 6pm and put our name in for dinner - waited an hour just to get to the rooftop bar which was at capacity. We didn't get called for dinner until THREE hours later and that was only because we kept asking. Once we sat down, the service was average, the menu options limited, and the food was mediocre at best. The portion sizes were small for the price and it seemed that the only thing the cook knew how to use was olive oil. The smashed potatoes felt like eating a stick of butter. They call this a ""beer garden"" but it's really just a rooftop restaurant with a little bar area attached. If it weren't for the nice weather and good company, I would have left in a heartbeat.

1.0,5/21/2013,"Went here on a date while I was visiting New York and WOW was the service horrible. Hearing that it was a ""beer garden"" we figured we would order some appetizers since we weren't that hungry and drink copious amounts of beer. After we finished our cheese and sausage plate, the waitress brought us our check without asking. We ignored it and ordered more beer. She brought the check two more times without asking then told us that the manager told us we needed to move to the ridiculously packed bar if we were only going to drink. All of which would've been fine had there not been more than 5 open tables around us nearly the entire time we were there. We asked for the manager to come over and the situation got even worse. She again told us we needed to move to the bar if we didn't plan on eating anymore. When we pointed out all the empty tables around us, she told us they were ""reserved."" I made a point to say one table in particular hadn't been seated all night and then she went to show me her iPad so I could see how ""busy"" they were. I understand lady. We had to wait 45 minutes too. Its almost like they make you wait just so it seems ""exclusive"" even though you get up there and there are lots of open tables but the bar is packed. Not to mention the manager did not know a single thing about customer service. It would be one thing if every table was full and she came over and said ""hey we need to move you to the bar to allow for reservations. The first round of beers is on us."" But no she came over and literally argued with us. I believe in ""the customer is always right"" within reason. Its almost as if they were told ""the customer is always wrong. defend your poor service to the end!""Part of me was impressed at how terrible the service was. Almost like it was one of those places where they were intentionally rude but we weren't in on it.Won't ever go back to here.

4.0,5/12/2013,"Came here prepared to wait and wasn't disappointed. Luckily, the weather was nice and I wanted the rooftop experience, so I was willing to hang out. I grabbed a seat at the bar and got going with some cheeses - the ricotta, the provolone, and the Gorgonzola- as well as their charcuterie plate. The speck was my favorite of the meats, and the ricotta paired with the honey that came alongside was so good I could have licked the plate. When we (finally, and long after their estimated wait time) got a table, I tried ther funghi misti, or their sautéed mushrooms with an English pea purée. While the mushrooms were great, the portion was smallish and the purée didn't add. The service this whole time was a bit minimal- I drained two water glasses slowly before getting a refill. Luckily, the tiramisu was amazing to the point I forgot about all else.

4.0,5/9/2013,"After hearing about this place several times, we finally decided to check it out.  We were afraid the wait was going to be long since it is 1) a rooftop bar & restaurant 2) in Manhattan 3) which may draw the curious and tourists who came to check out Eataly 4) and it was a gorgeous spring night in NY.After meandering through the shopping center that is Eataly, we found the large sign to the La Birerria.  Thankfully they went high tech with the reservations system, similar to Meatball Shop, and told us they would text us in 20-30 min when a table would open up.We wandered around the main floor maze, checking out the cheeses & desserts while waiting for our table.  We were buzzed 20 min later and then headed up the elevator to the 14th floor.  The place is nicely setup with the bar and dining area separated by a partition.  There was also plenty of space between each table...no crowding!  Our server was energetic and attended to us quickly.  We ordered the three cheese platter, the Affettati Misti for 2 (i.e. tasting of all their charcuterie), split the Misticanza salad as well as the beer & apricot braised pork shoulder.  The cheese and charcuterie were excellent starters, a reasonable size that were tasty and filling enough before our main course.  The salad was ok, though it may have been overshadowed by the cheese and meat platters we just had. The highlight was the amazingly soft and juicy pork shoulder.  It rested on a bed of apple and mustard vinaigrette which l loved but my wife could do without.  However we both agreed that this is the dish to have there, especially among the meat lovers.The beer selection is vast in that there is a style for everyone.  I had their cask stout which went well with the pork shoulder.  Overall a great place to go as long as you can get a table.",1,0,0,Henry S.,"Cary, NC",102,116,199

It was totally stressful navigating through the insanely packed, strangely Disneyland-esque Eataly ground floor establishment, but there was no line to get up to La Birreria.

Not a bad trade off since there was no wait for a table for 6. Once you go up the elevator and stairs, the hostess brings you to your table. We had a round table in the back corner which wasn't as sunny as we had been warned. If you've been to one of Batali's restaurants, it's pretty similar just with an extensive beer menu instead of wine. They throw the bread on the table, slab some oil on a plate, and serve the italian meat and cheese selection.

4.0,1/15/2013,"This is a great place to pass an afternoon with friends drinking beers, expecially when its nice weather and during the work week.  After being processed downstairs - seriously, I felt like I was on a tour in Italy when the tour bus drops you off where the locals are hawking their wares - we came up here to sit at the bar and drink some of the different beers.  It was definitely less crowded up here and seemed more secluded, far from the madness in the food halls below.",0,0,0,Marcus D.,"Boston, MA",40,668,0
4.0,1/11/2013,"We returned to Birreria in early December and our service was much better the second time around. Our server knew everything about the menu and the beer and wine selection. When I requested a bloody mary, she asked me if I wanted it mild or spicy. I just wish I remembered her name! We shared an apricot pork shoulder panini and calamari, which was a special that day. The panini was excellent and came with a small salad dressed in vinaigrette. The calamari was grilled and tossed with olives, tomatoes and onion, and served over grilled bread. It was delicious and much lighter than the usual fried calamari (aside from the bread which I couldn't stop eating). This place is a little on the steep side of the wallet for lunch, but we've started our last two long weekends in New York there so it's becoming a tradition. I'm sure we'll return next time we visit as well.",5,0,4,Michelle C.,"Philadelphia, PA",4304,2009,2889
1.0,1/8/2013,"We weren't huge fans of the overcrowded and overpriced food court atmosphere downstairs, but we thought, given its convenient location near my husband's work, we'd give the rooftop Birreria a chance during what we predicted might be a less busy time, 5 pm on a weekday.We were right about the timing, but unfortunately, greed reigns over hospitality at the Birreria. First of all, when we asked to be seated at an actual table (party of 3), they wanted to be sure everyone was eating a full meal. Though we had obviously come with the aim of drinking and eating something, we hadn't really decided on the extent to which that might be happening; since the place is so casually called ""Beer Garden"", we thought that would be ok. Not so much. I understand, if the place is packed, that they need to make maximum cash and tips off of every seat they use, but the place was basically EMPTY and stayed that way until 7 when we left. So there was no need for the robotic stinginess. Maybe you shouldn't call your restaurant a beer garden if you are aiming to score a full meal off of everyone at the table. Just putting that out there.So we said we'd all be eating (though one of us didn't in the end), and ordered wine for the table, which was fine. My husband got the fish (fine) and I got the steak (fine, but very meager for the price when compared to other amazing places like, for instance, Casa Lever). The waiter didn't ask how I wanted it (rare) and I had to basically run him down to tell him when I realized he hadn't asked. His response: we do medium-rare here. And mine was, essentially: well, I do rare. I'm guessing you might have a better experience with the $21 sausage on a roll, but since that costs, like, $5 in every other ""Beer Garden"" in the world, I couldn't bring myself to order it.Most importantly, don't try to leisurely mop your plate with the bread they provide after you are done with your meal. FOUR bus boys and our waiter all tried to yank (yes, yank) my plate and run when I hand't even finished. Whether you want to call this phenomenon attentive service or boredom, it's obnoxious and fully representative of the greed-driven ""trough mentality"" that you find in lower-quality NYC restaurants that are attempting to be higher end: Eat and get out!! Again, I might be more understanding in a packed house. But the place was empty.In the end, Eataly remains great for what we knew it was great for: overpriced specialty items that you treat yourself to when you miss Italy and want a little taste of it in the form of some cookies or a proper hot chocolate. But for the ambiance and price there are hundreds of nicer experiences to be had in NYC. It's fine, but don't go out of your way for it.",0,0,0,Hillary G.,"Manhattan, NY",0,2,0

The space was clean and inviting -- the roof was covered since it was winter, but was bright and sunny nonetheless. We sat at the bar and ordered a few drinks. I was pleased with the extensive beer menu and loved the look of the wine barrels set up behind the bar. The bartender was very helpful in guiding our choices and happily gave us samples to try. I went with one of the in-house ales -- a unique blend with honey-wine. I was very happy with the choice and would have liked to try the other ales offered.

If you like beer and want to enjoy it on a nice summery day in a beer garden environment, this is a top floor choice!Its kinda unique how you get here through Eataly and then a concierge waits by the elevator and it feels like you walk through an office building. people around us had some food and it all looked very good - on par with the other eataly dining establishments downstairs.",1,0,0,Ronald S.,"Middletown, CT",664,2142,5062

New York may be chilly, but this biergarden offered a warm escape high above the city. The retractable roof and space heaters kept the space cozy and the beer menu did not disappoint!I highly recommend trying some of their reasonably priced drafts and cheese plate. Three cheeses for $11 isn't too shabby. Not to mention, unlimited bread with the gorgonzola dolce, robiola bosina, provolone mandarone and honey was scrumptious perfection.  Please note: I do love a good cheese plate!!! The bartender recommended cacciatorini salumi - trust me, it was overpriced salami that I would probably not get again. Although, it did pair well with some of their beer selections.

We approached the downstairs counter and asked if they had room, they said 30-45 min for dinner but the bar was available for drinks. When we arrived on the 15th floor rooftop, there were several tables open so it was evident the 30-45 min bit was a stretch! It was also quite touristy. We ordered drinks, and after 5 min got a text that our table was ready.

Our server, Andrew was very helpful.. I wanted to change wines so he brought 2 heavy-handed tastes for me to try. The entrees was where I was disappointed.. I ordered the fish of the day, a halibut, pan seared with honey & blood orange.. It was very bland and for halibut, should have tasted fresher. It was very dry, too.

5.0,10/17/2012,"Birreria is hands down one of the most relaxed, refreshing, laid-back atmosphere rooftop restaurants around. I'm pretty happy it's still kind of a hidden gem. When most come to Eataly, I don't think they are aware that there is a beer garden 14 floors above them that brews their own beer!! Bonus. We started off with appetizers downstairs then eventually made our way upstairs for our main meal and drinks. My husband, Mom and I each had one of their three House Ales - on cask!! My husband had Wanda, Chestnut Mild Ale - darker, bitter beer that he enjoyed very much.  My Mom had Gina, Thyme Pale Ale - not my favorite but she really enjoyed it with the definite Thyme flavor, and I had Ruby, American Ale - between the Wanda and Gina, and a great beer.  We also got a sampler of the cask beers as well as a glass of the Barbera wine, quartino (250mL). They also have 1/2 carafe (500mL) and full carafe (750mL).We started with a cheese plate which arrived to our table VERY quickly; containing Asiago, Robiola (similar to a brie) and Taleggio (similar to a Manchego). This was the only downside...the rather large plate came containing only three very tiny pieces of cheese with a side of honey with 2 chestnuts. I would have liked to see either a smaller plate, or some other items on the place such as toasted baguette, crackers or fruit. Not happy about that (there are pictures which show this). Next we placed our order for our meal, my Dad ordered the Chicken thighs which comes with 3 thighs! Add another for $6, my Mom went for the Sausage with kraut and mustard, my husband had the blood sausage (Biroldo) and I had the lunch version of the Pork Shoulder sandwich with cabbage. This meal made our day. The portions are not large so you don't leave feeling stuffed and uncomfortable, the food tasted delicious and we all finished our plates, clean!Our waiter offered dessert, but suggested to have Gelato downstairs..which we did! Also, must mention our AMAZING waiter, Mike. Thumbs up. He was a great waiter and he gets bonus points having poor eye sight...that got him an extra tip.

Thanks a lot. Once upstairs, the bar was not that impressive. Yes, it was pretty cute because it was on a rooftop, but the bar area was completely covered up to by glass panels.

Further, there were no views - all you could see was the top of another building. The beer selection was decent but expensive! There were several $7 beers, the rest were $20+... no thanks. After having to wait to get in at 5:30pm at a saturday as if it were an exclusive club, I was expecting more.In short - overpriced, loud, and pretentious.

This time we didn't have to wait in a fake line. However, once we got to the top I asked if we could have a table to sit at to order apps and drinks - about 80% of the tables were empty and we were with the parents, for whom it is uncomfortable to stand for extended periods of time. The hostess informed me that we could only sit if we ordered entrees because the other tables were reserved (really? you're going to have 30 tables' worth of people come in at 5:30pm?). However, my bf's mother decided to take matters into her own hands. She checked the menu to see if there was any mention of that rule (there wasn't) and asked for a table. We proceeded to order two apps and a round of drinks and experienced no problems with checking out, despite not having ordered a single entree.

While the rooftop / garden / outdoor NYC experience makes experience shine (beautiful evening with perfect weather)...the unfortunate downside to La Birreria is the service. From the moment our group was seated, we were rushed to choose and order drinks --and then immediately asked to order food. I hadn't even had the menu in my hands more than 2 minutes. We politely asked the waitress to come back and we might have a few decisions on food. When she came back with our beers she asked again if we were ready to order. Again, we reminded her we'd need a few minutes to make some choices... and her response a curt reminder that because we're seated at a ""dining table,"" that we'd have to order at least one entree. OK, ok, chill! Eventually we order a few things to share among 7 people. Food came out quick which was pleasing... but once we finished our food we were hurried again to order anything else (more beer, or dessert), and then hurried to more or less wrap it up with our drinking.

1.0,9/2/2012,"Sorry in advance, this is going to be a tough review.  We've been looking forward to trying Birreria for a while.  I am more than willing to drop top dollar on a meal if it is worth it.  Let me say in advance that everything we ate was well seasoned and well prepared.  The pork shoulder, though meager, was excellent.  The Flank Steak was cooked perfectly to our liking.  The good news stops there.The service in this place is horrid.  We showed up early Sunday morning to get seats.  At the bottom floor, the hostesses was visibly irritated that we're we're there early, and told us to come back later.  Ok, fine, but when I asked a question about the menu, and what was on tap, she said she didn't have a clue as to what was available.  Really? Way to sell!(Turns out this dogfish inspired restaurant only had one of their selections on tap). We patiently waited in a line until the waitress looked up from her iPad, about 11:32, and told us to head on up.When we reached the top, we were lessthat thrilled with the lack of direction as to where to go.  Again, the greeter there took their sweet time seating us.  Although the restaurant was empty, we were led to the seats at the entry.  I asked nicely if we could move further in.  The waiter responded that he would have to inquire if that was possible.  He returned, visibly annoyed, and took us to another table in the direct sun, between two umbrellas, but not under them.  (The adjacent tables remained empty for our visit). We were about to order drinks, when the waiter informed us we would have to wait until 12, according to NY law (not his fault for sure). So we ordered a 5 cheese for $15.  That came later.  Turns out, because of switching casks, and a lack of communication, we didn't get drinks for 45 minutes into our meal.  The waiter was no where to be seen when we needed him.  When we ordered our meal, the server frequently interrupted telling us that simply wouldn't be possible, no the cook wouldn't do that.  We were simply ordering food, and sides, and not asking for substitutions, but he was to abrupt to wait to hear that for himself .In short, service was slow, unaccomidating, rude, and impatient.  The food was excellent, when we got it... But I don't think I would bother going again.  I wouldn't want to put them out!  Sorry Sam, we love dogfish, and we would drive to Delaware to eat there, but this combo just isn't working.",0,0,0,David G.,"Flatiron, Manhattan, NY",1,1,0

And he asked what we would like to order.  At this point, nobody ever stated their name nor that they were our server.  And when I asked (jokingly) if the other guy didn't want to serve us, he seemed a little perturbed and stated that HE was our server.  (Ok...Smile, to calm the tiger... Sorry I wasn't aware.)  We ordered our food, almost as if it were a bother to him to be our server.  After having ordered, we opened our bread packages.  No butter, no olive oil, just bread wrapped in brown butcher paper (I liked that it was so rustic).  My water needs a refill... looked around, didn't see our server.  Tried to catch the eye of a busboy... No luck.  I had to ask for more water after waving someone down.  At that point I asked for olive oil.  And was brought this amazing nutty, fragrant olive oil.  Heaven on a plate.The Barbera I had was fruity, just as I expected.  Not what I wanted.  The food came and it looked beautiful.  I ordered the Salumi Misti $21 and three cheeses $11 and then they dropped this small side plate of honey with hazelnuts.  This put my tasting menu over the top.  Was the Barbera the right wine? No.  But I was happy with just that  and my cheeses and meats.  Water emptied again?  Yep.  All in all, I had a much better experience at this little local place where the service is amazing, food is wonderful, and people aren't snobby.  I get it.  You want to be upscale.  I get it that you have served the likes of Robert DeNiro.  I've served some pretty famous people too.  Just remember us local folk is what keeps the money in your pocket.  We were polite and not very demanding.  We are nice people wanting a nice late lunch, save the attitude for people who are real a$$holes.To the server: I tipped you well because I was one of you.  You seem like you could be a really cool person.  I tried to break through that rough exterior.  Yet, you wanted nothing to do with the likes of anyone at my table.  Sorry we aren't part of the pretty people.  That we are sub par to your expectations of guests, and you thought we would stiff you.",2,0,0,Christina C.,"Santa Fe Springs, CA",131,21,22

I am neither a tourist nor a celebrity, but somehow I ended up here with my sister, her manfriend, and two of their friends. We asked downstairs if we could nab a table and were told it would be about an hour wait, but there was probably room at the bar. We decided to take our chances, only to discover that there were a TON of empty tables and sure enough, we could nab one. Okay. You think they'd have better communication with the upstairs, especially considering that one of our party was pregnant and standing at a bar is probably not the best idea for her. The food was pretty good, but tiny portions were definitely not worth the $400 bill. The beer selection is overwhelming and everything I sampled was great. The ambience IS lovely, but kind of ruined with people snapping pictures of whatever celebrity is there today. (When were there, it was Gabourey Sidibe, of the film Precious.)

1.0,8/21/2012,"So i heard really positive reviews about this place from friends so i was excited to check it out for myself, went in for lunch. We arrived and were promptly seated after some difficulty finding it in the eataly building. The hostess was pleasant and responsive. We get a table, nice and off to the side, away from the bustle at the bar. We are offered sparkling, still, or ice water, given menus and left to wait, 2 minutes pass and the water arrives, so far so good. So we sit and look over the menu, choose some beer and expect to see our waiter to take a beer order as the place seems renowned for its beer. Some time passes, more time goes by, maybe 20 minutes later our server stops in to take an order, no pad and paper, seems confident.  I relay my order of two beers, a three piece cheese plate, a plate of supresetta, some fried shiitake mushrooms and a skirt steak with mushrooms. He asks if i would like it separated into courses, i say sure. He leaves and ten minutes later the cheese and salami arrives. We consume it in about six minutes along with the bread they served us, i was relatively pleased. They pull the bread out of a large cauldron in the middle of the room so theres no chance of getting a warm piece and serve you a little bit of olive oil, but no salt or pepper on the table, whether its proper or not i enjoy seasoning the oil to taste. Okay so we have finished the first course, its been 20 minutes and no beer at a place known for beer and no matter how much eye contact i give the people in uniform no one will come over. I'm not going to shout, whistle, or raise my hand, this is supposed to be a service based establishment. Sooo i wait a little longer and a new woman comes by to ask us how everything is, i say we have been waiting on two beers and it has been some time. She tells me that my server left and failed to mention we had an order in progress.Now, ideally if the server had any talent he would have come to the table and said something like, "" I just wanted to let you know we are in the middle of a shift change, i will be leaving and so and so here will be taking over, heres your beer and i hope you enjoy the rest of your meal"". But no, he left with no word and us in the dust beerless. Beer comes, i like it. The moment is saved, until the salt lick arrived. So i ordered fried mushrooms. I realize they don't have seasonings on the table so they have to put some on in the kitchen but this had to be a mistake, it was absolutely horrendous, it was so salty it felt like my tongue was burning. The skirt steak was alright, medium rareish, not very warm the mushrooms served with it tasted like they were marinated in a straight red wine vinegar and then sauteed in more. Very harsh tasting in general. We finish the entrees, someone takes our empty still water bottle away but does not offer another. We sit for 15 minutes with our silverware set aside on the plate and no appearance of trying to eat more. The waitress who seemed to claim us was chatting with a man in plaid at the central island wait station, ignoring my vigilant attempts to get her attention, another server notices us and clears our plates and offers us anything further. We decline and ask for a bill. Five minutes pass. Bill comes. Paid cash and left. Never felt like we had a server taking care of us , the food was mediocre for the 84$ price tag.

I didn't either, thanks Wikipedia).Good thing we had already eaten and this was merely a snack. The apple and fennel salad was refreshing. The roasted maitake was underwhelming and rather sloppily thrown together. Also had the selection of salumi - the soppressata was quite good, but the stand-out was definitely the cacciatorini.

However, once getting up to the rooftop is worth it as it is a nice atmosphere and pretty decent view. Drinks are reasonable and range from $7 and up and I do not think they offer Happy Hour there.

The platter cost $90, if I hadn't mentioned that.What we received for our $90 could barely be turned into three or four average-sized sandwiches. A single ramekin of mashed potato for FIVE people to eat? Five normal, healthy, full-sized people, rather than tiny ant-sized people? What went on when they were devising these portions? None of us are super-heavyweight, globe-shaped gluttons by any stretch, but this was a poor excuse for a platter and, while certainly delicious, was horribly overpriced.

Admittedly, I've only been twice, but both were in the middle of a weekday before work lets out, so I was surprised at the crowds (maybe everyone else is enjoying some funemployment like me?) When we asked for a seat for two for lunch, we were told that we could wait for 30-45 minutes OR check out the bar upstairs, which was standing room only. We opted for the bar, to at least grab a drink before lunch time. When we reached the rooftop, it was hot, sweaty, and crowded, but a beautiful day. After spotting a small family getting ready to leave, we obtained a seat without hardly waiting at all. We ordered our beers, of which they had an excellent selection of Dogfish Head and house-brewed brews, and were offered some homemade bread made from the spent grain from their brewery. We didn't try any cask beers this time, but next time I'll be sure to. Despite getting the text to let us know a table had opened up, we opted to keep our seat at the bar for the bonus of people watching and proximity to the bartender. I'll say that the Captain Lawrence Liquid Gold was nothing to write home about, but all the other beers I tried were thoroughly enjoyed. For lunch, my partner and I ordered a cheese plate with gorgonzola, taleggio, and robiola bosina which was served with a sort of honey hazelnut thing. Along with the spent grain bread, this was the ideal dish before our ""main course"" the ProBusto sausage platter with coriander potato and mustard greens. While it seemed a little pricey initially, the sausage was more than enough for the two of us, and was plump and juicy. Not usually a fan of mustard, this was especially fantastic to enjoy and the potatoes were so well seasoned and well mashed.For the whole experience, I'd consider it worth every penny, and we left with full bellies and not-too-empty wallets.",1,1,1,Jordan P.,"Philadelphia, PA",747,400,652

4.0,7/28/2012,"La Birreria was probably the most hyped portion of the Eataly concept, even if it opened awhile later than everything else.  I've walked through Eatlay a lot but never tried it out even though I'm a huge fan of beer bars.  One day I was meeting up with a friend who is also a beer junkie, so I finally relented.  The whole false exclusivity and host stand downstairs is a crock of shit.  When we got up there, the bar was packed but the place was half empty in terms of tables.  If that's the case, then why can't you just let me make a reservation in advance?  My advice--as bad as this sounds--is to lie if necessary to the hosts downstairs just so you can get upstairs with minimal bullshit.  The host stand upstairs is much more accomodating and realistic.  The space itself is nice as you can expect, although I'm not sure why they didn't get something with a better view of the city.  It defeats the purpose in a way.  Service is friendly, knowledgeable and efficient as you can expect.The food is typical Batali: very well done but a bit overpriced and underportioned.  I got the Biroldo, which was great.  It had been awhile since I had blood sausage and this was a great refresher on why it is awesome; it was full of rich, porky flavor.  It was also a decent sized portion all things considered.  The cannelini bean salad on the other hand was a but bland, even with the pickled turnips included.  My friend had the pork shoulder, one of the more popular things on the menu.  I thought it tasted good, though at a much smaller portion and not nearly as enjoyable as my dish.The beer selection at La Birreria has expanded from just Dogfish Head, Birra Del Borgo and Baladin since it opened to include other major American microbrewries--such as Victory, Ommegang and Allagash--as well as some other Euro brands.  We stuck to our guns and got Dogfish Head though, which is a partner in La Birreria and perhaps the most innovative brewery on the planet--as well as my favorite.  I was ecstatic that I got to try Dogfish Head's new beer, 'Birra Etrusca', which is 2,800 year old ancient recipe from Italy that they've recreated with Balladin and Biraa Del Borgo.  It is brewed with hazelnut flour, pomegranates, 2 kinds of honey, gentian root, and myrrh tree resin--yep, got to love Dogfish Head.  A version is going to be made by each of the 3 brewers and released in the fall, but the first test batch was brewed by the Dogish Head head brewer and the Eataly head brewer right here at the beer garden.  The beer itself was great but hard to describe; kind of like a delicate, subtle barleywine of sorts.  Like a lot of ancient recipes it doesn't fit neatly into the modern idea of what mean is supposed to be like.  It was delicious never-the-less.  The only annoying thing was that the beer was served lukewarm, but it came from a cask so what can you do.  I'll be grabbing all 3 versions once it is released, but it's awesome that I was able to try it here first;  cool shit like that is one of the main reasons to go to La Birreria.  All said this place definitely has its faults, but even Batali can't fuck up a great idea like a rooftop beer garden in the middle of NYC.",4,2,2,Justin L.,"New York, NY",900,1005,34

It started to get really cramped near the bar but luckily we snagged a high table.The beer menu was very expansive and they had multiple house beers on tap. This was leaps and bounds better than the complete lack of options at The Standard Biergarten. My friends and I stayed a few hours so I got to try a few of the house beers. My favorite was the Baladin Nora Sour which had notes of Ginger, Orange Peel, and Myrrh. It was delicious and very refreshing on a hot day! One of the most unique beers and probably best beers I have had. I also tried one of their house cask beers the Wonda which is a Chestnut Mild Ale.  It was OK but nothing spectacular.  I also had the Ommegang Rare Vos Ale (with Notes of Orange and Coriander) and the Gina (a Thyme Pale Ale).  Both were just OK.Despite a few hiccups, I will probably be back with a group of people or for an after work drink but it won't be first on my list.",1,0,0,D C.,"New York, NY",9,87,6

This last time, however, was pretty ridiculous.I arrived on the day before July 4 with a 3:45 reservation for 5. It turned out only 4 of us were going to come, so when we arrived, we let them know it would be 4 people. Despite us having a reservation and there being at least 8 empty tables, it took us about 20 minutes to get seated, and just as long to get a bartender's attention at the bar. We sat down, ordered food & more drinks... when our 5th friend decided to join. I KNOW - this makes my table seem like a terror to the restaurant, but there were SO many empty tables that it didn't seem like it should be a problem.We let our waitress & the maitre d know we'd have a 5th, and they made us cancel our food order & wait at the bar for ANOTHER half hour - even though they said as soon as she came upstairs, they'd seat us. There were literally multiple empty tables for 5, and they couldn't give us any good reason we had to continue waiting, despite having already tried sitting & ordering food!I gave the Birreria multiple fair tries, and it let me down every time.

There was nothing distinct about this place.  Waiters wore jeans - not the best image.  Service was good.  There wasn't much of a view except for the top of a few buildings and the Empire State Building.  I thought Birreria would be more sophisticated.  The food, however, was splendid.  I had the Bistecca with Salsa Verde.  It was cooked perfectly and the sauce was a perfect compliment.  Really top notch.  The mushroom and cheese selection were superb.  Dessert was good but the Tiramisu had too much cream and not enough lady fingers.  Also the assorted cookies selection was too small.  Very good beer selection.",0,0,0,Peter M.,"Bronx, NY",6,8,9

The view is spectacular, the food is delicious and, whether you choose beer or wine, you are not likely to be disappointed. And it is perhaps because all of these things are so great, that the simple and yet constant ways in which they fail to live up to expectations is so frustrating. I recently moved just a few short blocks away, and have been going to La Birreria 1 - 2 times per week for about the last 6 - 8 weeks. Here is the issue: they almost always tell you there is wait, even when you can clearly see that there are a number of tables available. I asked about this recently and they said they were holding the tables for reservations. Unfortunately, this doesn't quite pass the smell test, as several remained empty the whole night. If you do make a reservation, and arrive more than 15 minutes after the time, they cancel it. Normally, I would say fair enough, except that I have often made a reservation, arrived on time, and then been told that I have to wait at the bar for more than 30 minutes before my table will be available (even when I can clearly see that there are a number available upon my arrival). When it has happened that I have arrived without a reservation, they often quote one time, only to leave my group waiting more than double the time they quoted. (Last time they said 20 - 30 minutes. After an hour and 15 they invited me upstairs only to tell me that it would be another 20 minutes...again, I counted 7 tables free - one of which they sat us at later). I've begun to wonder if they actively deceive people, so they nearly everyone has to go to the bar before being seated, as a way to increase revenue.

1.0,4/18/2012,"Probably the worst dining experience I've ever had in NYCWe sat down in a good mood with absolutely no expectations.. The menu looked pretty good. I fully expected the prices to be steep, given the dynamic of the space (rooftops are expensive to lease operate, especially in NYC), but the prices actually kinda blew me away. But whatever, no big deal right?My extremely overpriced bratwurst was extremely flavorless, textureless, and underwhelming in any other category imaginable. It was the wurst (pun intended). Out of the 6 of us, only one other person's entree was good. We were told to order the fried shitaake mushrooms, which tasted like over-fried bits of cardboard.. This takes the cake for worst fried food I've ever had.None of us felt good on the way out. Both me and my sister got pretty ill. I had to throw up before going to bed.Not sure if it was an off night or what, but it was so bad, I couldn't fathom giving them a second chance. After dining in hundreds of different restaurants in NYC, this is the ONLY place I emphatically tell people to avoid.Edit: Forgot to mention -- There is ZERO view. Literally, no view. I don't just mean ""oh this potentially sweet view is partially obstructed"", but there is literally not a morsel of building to be seen, save for the top of the top of the top of the spire of the empire state building. You can't even see the sky - 95% of the garden was domed over with opaque glass. What a let down.",8,3,0,Larry S.,"Brooklyn, NY",5,12,0

Located at the top floor, it's such a perfect environment to kick back and catch up with your friends. -I love the incorporation and use of the iPads for hosts and servers. SERVICE: 3/5-They wanted to charge us $5 to cut a cake we brought from Paris Baguette, each person. WTF?!-Other than the above, the service was decent. Waters were filled without any requests-Automatic grauity of 20% for large parties of 5+-The whole party must be present to be seated at tables. FOOD: 4.5/5-Piatto misto ($90) was plenty for six people. You get two portions of the pork shoulder, 2 links of Probusto, 6 Cotechino (pork sausage), 6 Biroldo (blood sausage) and your choice of three contorni (we picked broad beans, carrots and olive oil smashed potatoes)-The pork shoulder is beer-braised that is cooked long enough that the meat shreds off with ease. The flavor is explosive and was my favorite part of the Piatto misto.-The Probusto is tied with the Cotechino. If you've ever had Taiwanese sweet sausage, you'll be reminded of that with the Cotechino. -The blood sausage is okay and not the greatest. -Of the Contorni, my favorite was the carrots with mustard followed by the smashed potatoes.

The woman was so sweet and allowed us to be seated earlier. Their rooftop beer bar is gorgeous and the atmosphere was perfect for enjoying great company and delicious Italian Food. I had so much fun relaxing and laughing with my friends. We took our time and did not feel rushed, which I say is pretty rare for any restaurant, especially in NY. I don't remember what I drank or ate. Some dry cider, an assortment of cheeses, salumi, prosciutto... Mmm. Everything was just so yummy. Our server was spectacular, very accommodating and friendly.

4.0,4/6/2012,"Yes I'm giving this place 4 stars despite other Yelpers' reviews. I made a reservation so I guess that made all the difference when it came to getting into this place. There was a long line of people and I saw the bouncer/whatever you wanna call him telling people the roof was at capacity and people had to wait. This was at 6 pm on a Thursday. Me and my friends had reservations so they let us get in the elevator right away. This place is just awesome... So chill. The perfect place to come and unwind with done beer, good and friend. I didn't find it pretentious at all. I guess before to the elevator I was just really distracted by all the available products at Eatalay so I made a mental note to come back and check it out for some grocery shopping. That market just makes you feel like you want to become the next Top Chef. Ok back to la Birreria. We ordered beer and then some more. The bartenders were cool and the crowed seemed to be a mix of people who had just gotten out of work and group of friends who just wanted to chill. Me and my friends were both. We ordered the pork shoulder and the steak and they were really good, highly recommended from my part. We also had some of the cheeses with the salumi and they were good too (wish it would've been more abundant). We also had a salad, can't remember the name but it was the second one on the menu with the apples. It was good as well. So in conclusion I will def come back to this place but with reservations to avoid any of the issues other yelpers have complained about.

It has a nice long bar, a large open dining area, and a great location on a roof top with glass ceilings.The poor rating is due to the poor service. The bartender looked annoyed every time I ordered a beer. Our table was ready an hour later than our reservation time. The server spilled a beer on my friend, hardly apologized, then talked smack about her to our friends at the other end of the table. He was nowhere to be found when we needed drinks or wanted to order any appetizers. In fact, we all agreed that service was so bad that we should leave.

The tables are only good for dining customers, not drinking ones, even if they're pretty empty.The ugly: The place can be a nightmare during happy hour and evening hours. We sat from early afternoon until the place started getting very loud and crowded at happy hour time. A friend was coming to join our table. He called and said the hostess downstairs needed to be called by the upstairs hostess. He was not even allowed to take the elevator up. I went and told the upstairs hostess my friend was downstairs and we wanted him to join our table. They told us we could not add anyone to our table. Why? Because there's already a wait on tables (even if the place was about 60% full). But we could just drink at the bar. I said that we were only 2 people at a table of four, and had been paying for food and drinks since the afternoon. They said that was their policy, and would not budge.

I love the atmosphere at this place, and it may be a great spot once Spring and Summer are officailly here, but the wait, and the process just to get to the bar, is a little absurd. There was a wait just to get to the bar, on a TUESDAY night. So my friend and I just decided to wait the 45 minutes for a table, at least we would be able to sit down once we got up there. So we had some drinks and cheese in the wine/cheese area downstairs at Eataly while we waited to get the text from the host that our table was ready. An hour and $50 later we finally got a table. Yay. This must be their business plan, make people wait, and they will probably spend money downstairs before they even get a chance to go upstairs, right?Once we finally sat down upstairs, we took a look at the menu, and were slightly confused. Isn't this place supposed to be Italian? The options were odd, with some mushroom dishes, salads, sausages and entrees. We would have been way happier with some pasta or traditional Italian choices! We ended up sharing a mushroom dish and we both got the pork chops. They were okay, definitely not worth $24 for mediocre bar food. We also were maybe expecting some shareable bar snacks, which they didn't have either. Disappointing!

4.0,1/19/2012,"I thought this place was a fantastic option for a group.  Big space, with larges table that can accommodate a sizable party of up to twelve-a difficult fete to find in a Manhattan restaurant...unless you feel like paying out your ass and getting some lame prix fix that most places try to pull for any group larger than eight.The warm palette, old factory style lighting, and wide plank wood floors give this a comfortable, homey feeling while the high retractable glass ceiling that offers an iconic city view reminds you that you're not in Kansas anymore.  Love the Biergarten setting, with an emphasis on not only the micro-brew beer selections, but also on the wines that they offer as well.The food was all very well done from the salumi and cheese to all of the different entrees.  It's a very meat heavy menu (no pasta, limited salads), with offerings such as braised pork shoulder (the table favorite), quail, pork chops, and house made sausages.  Even the sides are hearty and filling, and include multiple preparations of mushrooms, as well as potatoes and saurkraut.The only thing that I didn't particularly care for was our waiter.  Initially, we were only ready to put in our starters, but he made us put a complete order in all at once.  *Side note: Several places have done this to me before, and I'm not quite sure why this procedure is necessary.  I'm told that it's because of ""the kitchen"".  I don't buy it.  It makes me feel rushed from the get-go.  Not how I want to start the evening...I don't like to be told how I have to spend or enjoy my money.* The other thing that the server did is that when we were all set with apps, mains, and sides, he told us we were over ordering.  There were six of us, we each ordered an entree and ONE mushroom side to try-split between six people.  For apps, we ordered two salumi platters, two cheese platters, and one order of olives.  Maybe it's a bit much, but it doesn't seem completely overindulgent by any means.  The meat and cheese were meant to serve two-three people....so we doubled up since we were a party of six.  The server talked us out of one of the meat and cheese platters....which we ended up ordering seconds of after the fact, because it wasn't enough (funny how there was no problem putting that in after the rest of our order was placed).  I would definitely go back, and look forward to enjoying the space come spring when the weather is warm, and the roof is open.",1,1,1,Jaime W.,"Jersey City, NJ",106,144,0

Last night, I had my first real dinner there, and I got the chicken, which I never, ever order in restaurants normally because it seems so basic, but after the cured meats as an appetizer, I didn't really want more pork...and I must say, the chicken was actually very, very good with a tasty couscous salad underneath. And compared to the portions of the meat and cheese platters, I actually had 3x what I could eat and have some tasty leftovers. Win! My boyfriend got the quail, which was both of our first times trying it, and man, that was one tasty little bird!

It is on the roof with standing tables and a bar, and in the winter the roof is covered with a clear drape - so it feels open while still being warm. The wine they serve out of over sized barrels behind the bar. A very nice aesthetic touch, and they had maybe 6 or so beers on tap. We ordered a carafe of beer, which was served in an oddly shaped beer glass that more resembled one for wine. I would prefer a regular tumbler, but that is definitely a matter of taste and familiarity. Bartenders were friendly and efficient and the atmosphere had a very relaxed, almost European feel, which I was hoping for being part of the fantastic monster that is Eatily.

We were seated immediately and had no problems with the staff or service. Water glasses were filled quickly, and the waiter offered some suggestions of the menu. I went for a Ommegang Rare Voss as my beer of choice. The craft beer list is exceptional, as they also feature barrels of beer which are brewed on site, and a nice list of other cask type beers and bottles to choose from. The menu itself features a nice range of appetizers, cheeses, salamis, and entrees. Not a large amount of food options, but just right for a rooftop bar. A nice basket of bread was placed on the table. We started with the Fried Shitake mushrooms. Theses were addicting and so good! Made with sage and had a nice salty flavor to them.I had the Skirt Steak with salsify, green onion and salsa verde. Outstanding! The meat was cooked perfectly medium rare and was tender and moist. Delicious with good flavor. I have no complaints about this meal - setting, service, food. Everything was great.

I'll just split the bill for you!"" whoa.So he stormed off with the bill, split it for us, and then came back with all these charges that shouldn't have been made... thus elongating the process. um...that's why we were trying to split it calmly between ourselves.

3.0,10/25/2011,"Went on Saturday at lunchtime after I got the closing date for MadSqEats wrong and they were dismantling the booths when i showed up. Oops, party foul. Given proximity, we detoured to Eataly. I like Eataly and have been to all of the restaurants (except Le Verdure, because, why bother?) but I was skeptical it would meet the needs of our threesome (me, dad, fiance) given weekend crowds. However, fiance wanted to try Birreria so we went to check on the wait. Downstairs host quoted a 30 mins for a table, but no wait at the bar, so we went up to check out the scene and make a game time decision. Besides, it was noon on Saturday and we hadn't had a drink yet. The weather was a sunny and crisp 60 degrees, the roof was open, and there were seats at the bar, so we signed up to wait and ordered a carafe of the Barbera. We hadn't even paid for our wine when the host came to show us to our table. We got lucky tho, because by the time we left an hour later it was three deep at the bar. I really dislike the menu; I find it very awkward for lunch. I don't mind a spendy meal, but its lunch in a beergarden, amirite? I was looking for a ""lighter"" option, and aside from the heavy, $20+ entrees you are limited to (non-entree) salad, sausage, or mushrooms. Which i'm sure are all delicious, but a.) not much cheaper than an entree and b.) What? Am I going to single handedly house a $17 plate of mushrooms for lunch? Just, awkward.I notice on the website that they now offer a lunch menu that addresses these concerns, but it was not provided to us as recently as last weekend. Maybe it's weekdays only?Anyway, we were there, we were eating, we had to order, so I sucked it up, ordered the arugula salad and prepared to be underwhelmed. Fiance had the beer-briased pork shoulder with apricot and Dad had the fish of the day (halibut). Both of the guys were super pleased with their selections. Someone from the bar even came over to find out what we were eating b/c it looked so tasty. And absolutely no one could  have been more shocked than I was at the deliciousness of my salad. The shaved parmigiano was wonderful and high-quality, the seasoned/semi-dried cherry tomatoes were flavorful and interesting, and it was perfectly dressed with a tangy lemon vinegarette. I turned out to be a truly delightful experience. I think a bit of luck in terms of timing and exceptionally low expectations helped. The takeaway - the food is good, and prices are fair relative to NYC comps, BUT, keep in mind that the atmosphere reads ""burger and beer"" and the menu reads award-winning chef. The wine was fine, and we didnt feel ripped off on the price. It's a cool vibe when the weather is nice and the roof is open, but I bet it gets LOUD when it's closed. The clientel trends toward touristy/douchy which is pretty standard for places that get this much buzz. I'd go back on a nice day for a drink or a meal, but if the wait was long and the bar was jammed, I would probably figure out plan ""B"" real quick.",1,0,0,Mary H.,"Manhattan, NY",0,5,0

We seemed like we were bothering the two hosts who seated us without talking to us. Initially the waiter seemed attentive although not overly friendly. In fact all the staff seemed miserable and unapproachable. We ordered a cheese plate and some pork sausage and two beers. All delicious and quickly served. The sausage could have come with more sauerkraut and we had to ask for more bread several times before getting some. The bread was just OK. They have much better selection in their bread area. We wondered why there was no choice. Was really hard to find out waiter after the initial order. Had to wave him down for a second beer. There seemed to be no set stations and the waiters were all over the place. We saw several other tables having the same problem. In fact, we waving at the waiter who was right next to us talking to the manager who didn't seem to have his eye on service either. When we left we said goodbye to the host on the way out who was preoccupied on a laptop or ipad. He grunted without even looking up. Great concept, poorly executed.

5.0,10/18/2011,"It's a clever concept. Open roof that can be open or closed when the weather changes, the views are quite nice, although it is not a panorama if you were expecting Windows on the World type vistas. A definite plus if you like eating outside. Elevator up to the roof is in the front corner of Eataly by the cash registers, certainly not hidden as some have said. With a reservation, made online, and reconfirmed by phone, we had no wait at all getting in on a gorgeous Saturday at 5:45pm. One hour before sunset, prime time for the open sky thing to make it's magic.Service was excellent, the wait staff could not have been more helpful or friendly. Wine recommendations were answered intelligently. Nice choice of beer & wine. Most of the wine is Batali's partner - Joe Bastianach's -brand. Not a miss in the three we tried. The white chardonnay, the pinot grigio and a mellow red. These are the generic notations I gave them, not the actual Bastianach names, as we really did not study the menus, the waiter asked what we liked and these were the descriptions he gave of them! Quite pricey is the only complaint. Served in carafe's. The ""per glass"" prices seemed way over-the-top. But in NYC the Eataly prices seems to be stratospheric - but not too be questioned, so see my last review about the money spent at Eataly.The Shitake mushrooms were incredibly tasty, fried perfectly and the perfect appetizer. Get the 7 course cheese tasting if you have a small group, as the waiter pointed out, the $2 extra is well worth it over the 5 course portion. Again, the perfect secondi appetizer along with the bread. Not a huge portion but enough for 6 people to taste and enjoy all of them.The salads were excellent and actually a decent size, the pork shoulder was tender and tasty, not a large portion by any means, as none of the portions are really large, and it's foodie tasting-wisely necessary to share! Chicken thighs, served as cutlets with the cauliflower, the pork chop with the fingerlings, all winners. All perfectly done. We passed all of it around, and everyone had enough. No complaints there.The panna cotta with pomegranate seeds was the choice for dessert and was heavenly. Night had fallen and they reeled the roof in, lit the heaters and the atmosphere seemed to get even better.By now the bar area was packed. Everyone we spoke to at other tables, which seemed to be the normal thing, said what they had was excellent.So if money is no object, this is one of the nicest places I've been to recently for quality of food and atmosphere.  Just be prepared to own a bank.",0,0,0,Lenny S.,"New York, NY",113,99,0

The table we were seated at (with a reservation) was RIGHT next to the extremely LOUD bar. In fact, when the hostess put down our menus, the table was full of beer bottles and glasses and wine glasses with dregs in them that pple standing around the bar had set down there. One woman had set her purse on a chair at our table. The hostess asked her to move it. She came back a few minutes later and set her purse down ON the table while she looked for something. We were seated and all just looked at her and laughed. She must have been a bit drunk. i asked for a table not so near the bar but the hostess said there were none and that it was pretty much that loud all over the place, anyway. then we ordered a salume plate and a cheese plate. The 3 cheeses were lonesome on a big white plate. they brought us 3 slices of bread to start. we asked for more to go with the salume. which they forgot to bring. they later brought it gratis, but we had our entrees by then. i got a house-made beef and pork sausage with saurkraut (just a little pile of it--isn't cabbage totally cheap? couldn't they have given a bit more?). Very tasty and delish. The mashed potatoes w/ olive oil side was just ehh. unseasoned. one friend had the chicken thighs and didn't complain. Another had mushrooms and broccoli rabe that seemed good. We had a nice not-too-$$ red wine. that came in a carafe, not a bottle. so it was hard to tell how much to order. probably should have stuck with one of the 1000 beers they have there. I'll add this to the list of places I wouldn't bother going back to. The noise was terrible. it seemed like a big bar scene for local suits. Loud.

2.0,10/5/2011,"nothing special about this place.  getting the review up here as summer has officially come to an end and your friends' insistence on eating/drinking somewhere ""outside"" or ""with a roof"" is not as strong as it was a month ago is probably not that helpful.unrelated, what establishments don't have roofs?  tents?  parks?  there are not many places in new york city where you can go to eat or drink that actually do not have a roof, and so you should tell your friends that when they veto your suggestion of going to the levee because it doesn't have a roof.  it does.  that's why it's so dark in there.anyway, i'm not going to go back to this place any time soon, but the roof is actually covered (with another roof/ceiling/bubble boy like plastic enclosure), so i assume it will be operating year-round.  you need to go into eataly.  get lost, walk in circles, not be able to move because people with carts and cameras are also lost and their children are hiding behind the cheese, but they don't know that.  then you find the host/ess stand and the elevator that goes to sub roof 1.  the elevator has no weight limit, but it is limited to 8 people.when you get to subroof 1, you walk up some stairs and find some bathrooms and a mini-elevator that you may or may not mistake as the main elevator when you leave depending on what you've been up to once you get to the roof.once there, you'll find another host/ess stand and a bunch of tables and a bar.the menu was not really at all appealing with a choice of some sausages, and i like sausages, and then some other stuff.  the sausage was not great and nothing special at all compared to even the mediocre sausage at the standard bier(beer)garten(garden), and for $20+ at eataly and 1 ticket (i think 1 ticket = $5, but I can't remember) at the standard, i'd really expect something truly superior.  and it wasn't.also, they have their own beer on tap, which is interesting, but it doesn't taste good, and it was pretty warm.  if they're going to serve italian food with american, local ingredients, then that shouldn't stop them from serving italian/european/whatever style beer with the american ingredient of making it cold.  and they were like $10.  i think the cheapest beer you can get is an $8 bottle of dogfish head.  what the hell?  i can get a six pack for $12 at the deli.  no ketchup economics here.this is also a pet peeve of mine, but they insist that you have to place your order all at once.  i should step back - they insisted that we place our order all at once the one time i went there at about 6 in the afternoon - i don't know that they do that to everyone.  anyway, what that means is that when you're really hungry, they'd rather you not order an appetizer while looking over the rest of the menu because they want to be able to bring you all the food at once to turn the table over fast.  that's my jaded interpretation of the policy of requiring that a party order everything all at once, but i am not an expert and am open to correction.the service was fine and the people bussing the tables were far more polite and attentive than the actual wait staff.the numerous elevators are friendly to strollers (just keep in mind the 8 person limit)",1,1,0,Michael K.,"New York, NY",24,82,1

I thought it a little odd to have a beer garden serving Austrian/German inspired dishes atop an Italian market and decided it was a must to try. Especially with the fall quickly approaching, I wanted to take advantage of the nice weather while we still could. A quick elevator ride to the 14th floor (and a short walk up to the 15th) my eyes were greeted by a beautiful rooftop restaurant. Thank goodness for the sunny, warm day! There's a bar on the left with barrels of beer which is brewed on site and tables spread throughout. The music was all Beatles, Hendrix and the Stones. It's just too bad it was incredibly loud and it was drowned out for the most part.  The view is stunning and for a  casual spot, it has an upscale feel. Great for lunch/brunch. We had reservations so we were seated promptly. Nice little table top though we were next to the waiter station so there was a lot of traffic and there was no hiding from the sun. My back felt like it was on fire and my poor mom had the sun in her eyes the entire time. That would really be my only complaint about the seating. Note: They do have heaters and the Plexiglas (I think) roof is retractable for chillier days.Service: Our waiter was funny and accommodating. A busboy brought a plate of three cheeses to our table (which we did not order). Knowing this, we didn't touch it until the waiter came back. He said it was their mistake and to have fun because it would go in the garbage otherwise so why not? Something that bothered me was that we saw our waiter a total of four times but saw at least three other people during the course of the meal. I like bonding with my server and when it comes to tipping, I don't want to have to think about the handful of people. I would think a server wouldn't want that either, but hey, I don't trust people to do my job. Maybe that's just me.Meal: I had a nice white wine that was a mix of Riesling and something else. To start we shared an arugula salad that was deliciously dressed with a lemon vinaigrette, shaved parmigiana (of course it was fantastic) and yellow and red cherry tomatoes. I have to say they were the best tomatoes I've ever had. Nothing better than fresh veggies (or fruit, whatever you say). The cheese dish that I don't know what they were even though he told us lol, was fabulous. One hard, one soft and one that was just right. I could have eaten that forever but that's not what I came for. I ordered the Quaglia con Finocchio Manchester Farm boneless quail with Sambuca braised fennel. It was my first quail experience and what a fantastic one. The skin was outrageously flavorful and the meat was cooked evenly. Piaired with the fennel, omg it was the perfect bite. I savored every bit, grateful I skipped the bread. I will go back for sure to try the pork shoulder and advise that you get there before the cold months are here. It's way too gorgeous of a setting to miss out on.",1,0,0,Darcy P.,"Long Island, NY",47,185,69
3.0,9/18/2011,"I went to La Birreria on a Saturday afternoon, with a reservation for a table (allowed for parties of six or more. They are strict on their rule that they will not seat you until your entire party arrives) The beer was great - had an awesome wheat-y beer followed by a seasonal pumpkin ale - both delicious! Since we sat down for table service, we ordered a bit of food, and it was just ok. We shared a few cheese plates, and found that most of the cheeses were an acquired taste, which actually made them difficult for sharing. Others in our party ordered fried mushrooms and a sausage/sauerkraut plate, both of which they thought were ok. The ambiance was fun and relaxed, and there was a close-up view of the top of the flatiron building, which was neat. Otherwise the view left a bit to be desired for a rooftop bar. The music was great, lots of 90s classics, which our group of mid 20s - early 30 somethings really enjoyed!Overall, I would go back to the bar if I was in the area with a few good friends, but I would not go back for the table service.

We liked the beer list and the fact that the place was not crowded. My one star comes down to the following:1) We only saw our waiter twice. Once was fifteen minutes after we arrived when he took our order, the next was thirty minutes later when he brought our food. Then we never saw him again. Our table was cleared by the bus boy and we sat there waiting, but he never came back. So there was no question of whether we wanted another round of drinks, dessert, or even how everything was. After about twenty minutes, we asked another waiter where our waiter was. She went to the maître d. Basically, when the maître d needs to bring a table their bill, that is a sign of a serious problem. Even when we paid, the waiter was no where to be found.2) Prices and choices on the menu are good, but the food itself was really just mediocre.

It would've been a different situation if he had politely said ""We're going to close soon and I'd like to take that off your hands"". But no.

5.0,9/7/2011,"Came here on Labor Day a few days ago, and perhaps because of the holiday and emptiness of NYC, we didn't have to wait on any lines and were seated fairly quickly. The first thing I must say is that the view and the atmosphere of the place is just amazing. The roof itself already had great details that they kept when building this ""beer garden"" and everything added has only enhanced the space.Now, the reason I say ""beer garden"" in quotations is because it really seemed like more of a nice yet casual eatery or drink spot. It was clean and well spaced. The service was beyond amazing. I will note that a friend I was with happened to know the hostess and therefore we were approached with suggestions for what to order and inquiries on our satisfaction throughout our stay. We were treated very very well, but I'l like to think that anyone else would be as well. The manager came over to see how we were doing several time (he was incredibly warm and friendly) and the waiter was swift and polite as well. The food: The food was fantastic! Get the fried shitake mushrooms. Don't even question it, just order it. When I told a friend of mine I had just eaten at La Birreria she asked if I got to try the mushrooms. Apparently others are as impressed with this dish as I was. We split a bunch of the food (mushrooms as well) and also went with the arugula salad (standard but fresh and yummy) and a selection of three cheeses. The cheeses came with a side of honey. Love that.Finally, the creme de la creme - pun intended - was the very creamy and utterly amazing panna cotta we split for dessert. It was not only the best panna cotta I've ever tried, but probably in my top 20 favorite desserts I've ever had in my life (seriously, top 20 - think about how many desserts you eat in a lifetime, that's a great accolade). In fact, top 10 wouldn't be out of reach. I will never forget this dessert and mention it when people ask me about good desserts in the city.  I must also add that it was topped with the freshest berries you can have.

5.0,9/7/2011,"On a dreary, rainy night we decided to keep our reservation at La Birreria even though the other four people dropped out. I imagined a beer garden is not the best place to be on a night such as this. However, all the talk of crowds and craziness had vanished as the place was half empty. Fine with us. So, my husband and I settled at the bar to eat. I know wine a little, but as the bartender rattled off the wine selection I had no idea what was what so I let him choose. He gave me a Sangiovese and it was a little flat, but drinkable. My husband, ever the non-adventurous beer drinker chose a Moretti. Rumph. We ordered everything to share, but the meat. (I don't eat beef or pork) Ricotta FrescaParmigiano ReggianoPecorino Toscano (the best) SopressataMortadella Portobello Con Acciughe- grilled portobello mushrooms, white anchovies, tomato & stracciatella. So incredibly good. I could have just had this and been happy. Pollo Con Pesto Di Olive Verdi- Chicken thigh with sweet corn & pesto. Excellent, but def. not a light chicken dish. Panna Cota with berries- just the right consistency. A perfect end to a delicious meal.

3.0,9/2/2011,"Where do I begin.  Perhaps at the beginning.  I was so looking forward to this place opening.  When I heard that Sam Calagione and Vinnie Cilurzo were involved in a rooftop brewpub in NYC, I could hardly contain myself.  I texted my beer nerd friends the first time I saw Birreria mentioned in an article (probably 6-9 months before it actually opened).  The project was delayed over and over and they decided to install a retractable roof (probably necessary if they wanted to keep it open more than a few months a year).Last night, I finally made it.  I went over to Birreria around 5, left my cell number, and went off for a stroll around the Flatiron District.  About 45 minutes later (for a table for 2), I got a text saying that a table was ready for me... awesome!  We took the elevator up to the 14th floor and walked up to the roof.  The first thing that I noticed was the view... or lack thereof.  What was billed as sweeping views of the Empire State Building and Flatiron Building was more like the top few floors of each.  There's a giant brick wall around the roof.  Being part of Eataly, I was expecting some top notch food choices.  In reality, the food menu is pretty sparse and more suited to having a couple apps while you drink.  I had the arugula salad.  It was basically a pile of arugula with 3 cherry tomatoes and some parmesan.  The dressing was pretty delicious, but the acidity of it was too overpowering.Forgetting the view and food, the real reason I came to Birreria was the beer.  To say that I love craft beer is an understatement.  That being said, the beer menu did not disappoint.  The only other place I've seen so much rare Dogfish Head beer on tap is at their brewpub in Rehoboth.  I also tried a couple of the house brews.  Gina is a solid IPA, the thyme definitely adds something interesting.  Wanda is a solid brown ale, but lacks the kind of complexity I'd hope for in a beer produced by some of the best brewers in the business.  The menu calls it a ""mild"" ale and I'd definitely agree.  The taste is pretty underwhelming.Would I go back to Birreria?  Maybe.  I don't think it's worth waiting 45 minutes for.  Although New York's beer scene is pretty lackluster, there are plenty of good places to grab a pint with your friends that don't have a 45 minute wait.",1,1,0,Gabe A.,"Manhattan, NY",40,77,17

We were told at the elevator that there was standing room at the bar, but we decided that was fine. I was picturing a bar 5 people deep, but it was not bad at all! All the seats at the bar were taken, so we leaned against a column for a while until space at a cocktail table/ bar table opened up.

4.0,8/21/2011,"Can I give 3.5 stars? I'll round up because of the awesome roofdeck architecture and environment.Have been dying to try out La Bierrera, the newest of the Beer Garden trend that has been overtaking NYC the summer of 2011.  We went for brunch, which was a little awkward - there's a line downstairs manned by a bouncer to let parties onto the elevator leading up to the 14th floor roofdeck.  A little intense for my taste for a weekend afternoon, but whatever, it's in-demand.  The ambiance is perfection.  Red metal tables with nice silverware and stemware, a rustic-looking wooden bar with barrels of Italian wine, and a wide selection of craft beers make for an amazing happy hour location with upscale choices.  Not pretentious, very tasteful.  Even the branding matches the feel perfectly - I'm a big fan of the location and setting.The service, however, was incredibly lame!  Confused organization, swapping from one server to another, and stagnated presentation of courses made for an awkward interaction.  We ordered appetizers & entrees before being asked for our drink order, which came out post-appetizers, and they completely forgot about our entree until reminded.  When we'd try to get the waitress' attention, she looked completely stunned as to why we'd be waving her down - it felt as though we were inconveniencing her by asking for simple things like silverware or water....  The place is pretty new, so I'm sure they'll get the hang of it soon, but the waitstaff needs to get it together.The menu is a little weird for anything other than happy hour as far as selection goes, but what we ordered was all delicious.  The menu is comprised of cheese, salumi, mushrooms, and sausage sections that are all presented tapas-style.  There are also 6-8 entrees offered.  The cheeses and salads we had were awesome - arugula, pecorino cheese, and baby tomatoes for one, and a garden vegetable medley on bibb lettuce for another.  Creamy Gorgonzola was my surprising favorite cheese - served with awesome crusty bread, sweet honey and olive oil.  We all split the fish of the day as well - salmon, which was almost raw (how I like it!) but probably could've used a disclaimer that it'd be served almost sushi-style for those who expected more of a cooked filet.Overall, I'd definitely go back after work with clients or a date to enjoy the weather and small plates.",3,0,0,Emily R.,"Manhattan, NY",452,361,4

However, once you do get the text (and wait a little while longer for a table at the bar), you'll realize the wait is worth it. Our server was really nice and got us waters and delicious bread and olive oil. So yummy. He recommended a special salad with lots of basil, tomatoes and fresh mozz. We decided to go for it, because why not? It was good, but I'd opt out next time. The tomatoes and basil were flavorful, but it's a lot of the same thing on one plate, and I was looking for more variety. The mozz was delicious, but it was expensive to add it on, and there wasn't enough of it.The real deal was my entree and the delicious beers I had along with it.

Majority of the area is reserved for tables, and in order to sit at the tables you have to order food.  I thought this was more of a place where you grab drinks and hang out, but it def is more of a restaurant.  You can hang out by the bar, but it gets really crowded and it takes a while before you can order a drink.  Like everything else at Eataly, this place is definitely not cheap. We ordered the fried shitake mushrooms, which were absolutely delicious.  The mushrooms are lightly salted, and the breading is what makes it amazing.  We also ordered a Probusto sausage. For $21, you get two sausages atop a bed of steamed cabbage. I found them to be very average, and nothing more special than the Hillshire farm sausages you get at the super market.  Finally had the Insalata salad, which was very refreshing and perfect for a summer afternoon.  For some beers, they give you a universal beer glass that resembles a wine glass.  Looks a little pretentious for a beer glass, but what can you expect, it's Eataly.

Check in is on first floor and it was really confusing.  The security handling the line had no clue where people should go.  Meanwhile, the restaurant was trying to push supplies in and out of the area where people are waiting in line to get on this list. The hostess made us get on a list to go to the bar. You provide a phone number so you can get a text when you can go up. When we got the text 30 minutes later (on a Wednesday night!), we got put back in the same line as people trying to get on the list.  WTF?We go up to the bar and it was 3 deep - absolutely miserable.  Had one beer, which was pretty good, and then left because it was so crowded and miserable.If you really want to try this place, ask for a table.  But keep in mind they really spread the seatings out.  There were lots of open tables in the dining area when we went to the bar.

Pretzel bread, mustard, a cheese plate with all 7 cheeses, and the sausage misto plate for $95 worked out perfectly for all 7 of us 'old friends'.

Speaking of beer, the list is long and strong, with tons of bottle and draft beers and of the three house made cask brews, I would highly recommend the Gina, a Thyme Pale Ale. Yes, thyme. More specifically, fresh thyme from the hills of Borgorose, Italy. Combined with a traditional American Pale Ale, beer just does not get more food-friendly than this. The other two House Brews on offer are a Pale Ale and a Brown Ale, the former brewed with maple syrup. That's just SCREAMING for a plate full of sausage. SCREAMING. The menu holds true to its promise of conviviality, with many plates to share, and the exceptional ingredients you'd expect from the likes of Batals and Bastianich.Seven cheese, all from Italy, save one Ricotta Fresca from Connecticut. Who knew? Five types of salumi, three salads, six dishes from the grill, three dishes devoted entirely to mushrooms (I AM in the third ring of gluttony!), and House Made Sausage with a simple philosophy of its own: Italian recipes, with American ingredients, like pork from Bensmiller Farm, representing the four regions of Italy. The Cavolo Nero Con Salsa (aka kale salad) is hearty enough to stand up to a beer, and the pork shoulder is PHENOMENALLY tender and delicious, braised in beer and apricot, and Ooooooh Mama can you taste the love.

Last night our group of 12 loved everything they ordered including the salmon, bratwurst, blood sausage, and pork chop.

Again, our server had to check with her manager, who declined the request.It has been a long time since I've experienced such poor customer service.

One of our friends managed to get her upstairs (after about 15 minutes).  We ask our waiter if we can have another chair so she can sit down (there are plenty of empty chairs around and plenty of room at our table).  They REFUSE because their ""policy"" is that you can only sit with the group you originally sit down with.  We ask for the manager.  He comes over and also REFUSES.  We (a bunch of lawyers) try to reason with him: we understand the policy and the reason for the policy, but in this situation it their enforcement of the policy was absurd, impractical, and alienating their customers.  We weren't asking them to move tables, we weren't adding 3 people to a group of 5, we weren't disrupting the space or flow of the restaurant, and the addition of one more chair was not going to result in us taking a longer time or ordering less food.  We eventually get the waiter to bring us a chair (after asking for our check since we weren't going to stay if the 10th person at our group had to stand while the 9 of us were sitting and eating).  The manager then came over and said ""well it looks like you got your way this time.""NOTE TO MANAGEMENT:  CONSIDER ADDING A SMALL ALLOWANCE FOR COMMON SENSE AND CUSTOMER SERVICE INTO YOUR SEATING POLICY.",5,1,1,Katie S.,"New York, NY",0,14,0

1.0,7/13/2011,"Patricia is a horrible hostess! She should not be in the hospitality industry. Go do what you really love, Patricia, because clearly you hate customers. We had friends in town and they wanted to see Eataly. The men decided they wanted to eat and headed upstairs to Birreria. We didn't have reservations, but they were seated without a problem. They knew we (three ladies) were going to join them in a little while (20 minutes), so they got a table with some extra chairs. I passed through the two hostess stations by saying we were going to meet up with the rest of our party. No problem, and no one told me there was a policy against this.It was a Saturday afternoon, there was no line downstairs, and no line upstairs, and the restaurant was only half full when we went to meet up with the seated men. We got to the table and needed one more chair. The busboy said I needed to speak with the hostess (the same one who let me walk into the restaurant after I told her I was JOINING my husband). When I told her we would like another chair, she copped the bitchiest attitude I have ever seen. Treated me like a criminal. She stated that ""this restaurant has a NO JOINERS policy. That table did not tell me they expected more people. You cannot sit there."" She repeated this a few times, while I looked at her with my mouth hanging open. What was I supposed to do? Leave? All I could see were the open tables and the lack of a crowd. And we only needed one more chair, so it's not like we were trying to muscle in 5 more people to a two-top. When I said, very calmly and with bewilderment more than anything, that there were many free tables, she offered to get the manager. I said, Sure! and went back to the rest of my party, half of whom had food and drink in front of them. The manager did not come over, but Patricia did! And she said, ""The restaurant is willing to move you to a larger table."" When my seated, eating/drinking friend pointed to a table and said, Could we move there? Patricia LITERALLY SNEERED at him, and said, laughing,  ""I don't think so.""  We all started getting up at this point, saying thanks but no thanks, we are done. My husband got the check and we started to leave.Then the real manager then came up and acted like a hospitality professional, apologizing and saying that they would move us wherever we wanted. I told her it was too late, her hostess already ruined the meal for us, and just because I was unaware of their policies doesn't mean I deserved to be treated like dirt. What really made me scratch my head is that when we were passing by the hostess station, I purposely did not say anything to Patricia the Bitch Hostess from Hell. But she just couldn't help herself, and sarcastically yelled ""Thank you for coming!"" I would never say this lightly, but she deserves to be fired, if she isn't already. Again on the way out, there was no line of people, no crowd. And the restaurant was still half empty. Why didn't they tell me their NO JOINERS policy at one of the first two hostess desks I easily got through? Why weren't we offered a bigger table before being sneered at?

Perhaps your tolerance - for being seated in the blazing sun (despite the fact that plenty o spots in the shade were available) while all the frat house hits of the 90s are played and no one comes to bring you water/beer/food for a half hour and then when they finally do it's the wrong stuff - is higher than mine. In fairness, our poor waiter - who was sporting a pretty painful looking farmer burn - looked like he was about to drop from heatstroke. Even the cheese was sweating. And I didn't really want to stop and think about what the 2000 degree oven we were sitting in was doing to any of the more perishable items, i.e. my kale salad with ""anchovy vinaigrette"" (read Caesar dressing). Despite the fact that we were there at 5, they had already run out of one of their signature beers; and the arugula salad that my girlfriend had was so wilted it bordered on being the most expensive bowl of compost ever. I would definitely recommend this place to folks who want to recapture their salad days of college beer-bonging in the sun with douchebags in backwards facing baseball caps who just know that their air-guitar is certainly going to win them a spot in Led Zeppelin / The Who should they choose to reunite.

Food was kinda pricey... $21 for Bratwurst...Rooftop is ok, but not as big as I expected,and no view whatsoever...except maybe a corner of the Flatiron Building.  Not dark though, was very sunny. Not a beer garden vibe...at all.  They need to spruce up the hallway when you get off the elevator, cuz it looks like you are lost in some random office building, till you turn the corner into Birreria.Service is a bit slow, specifically slow turnover on tables.  The 2 tables next to us sat empty for most of the time we were there. They should do better at this especially since they take no reservations and there is a long wait. Regarding the wait staff, they were great, and very knowledgable.The thing that frustated me the most is the reservation system, or lack thereof  and the fact that they only allow complete tables and no joiners... First they make you wait on a line to then leave your name and cell number.  You have to wander around (at least Eataly is an interesting enough place to wander), waiting for a text from them, telling you they can now accomodate you.  When you get the text and get back there, you have to show them (surly security guard and the host) that you got this text. You better hope that your party is all there at that time, because if not, there is no way in hell they will ever let them up to meet you on the roof, whether you have been seated or not.... no way whatsoever..none, nada, zilch! anyone who wants to join you, has to now go through the same process you just went thru, so by the time they get up there, you will probably be done.  Oh and you can't say you just want to go up and chill at the bar either...there is a list/text system for that too.I can't offer them a solution, but people just need to understand this before they get there and are expecting someone to join them, cuz it ain't gonna happen.",0,0,0,Karen S.,"Brooklyn, NY",23,16,0

This spot is a testament to the growing beer culture in and around New York City. Sam Calagione, Teo Musso and Leonardo Di Vincenzo have created impressive brews and plan to continue collaborating on rotating and seasonal brews exclusive to this brew pub -- which is very exciting. The food from Mario Batali is a delicious and amazing complement to these beers but it should not be the main draw here. The beer is the star of this show and it deserves it.I will say that I expected to enjoy the view a bit more when I first heard about this rooftop brewpub but considering the amount of work that was required for the retractable roof (and to set up a brewpub on an NYC rooftop that could withstand the summer heat as well as winter chill), it's really not that bad. You have to be at the right angle to see the Empire State Building and don't expect to see the Flat Iron building at all but it's still nice to be outside and enjoy the NYC air -- which is a little nicer at that elevation than it is at ground level.Also -- for those complaining about the beer garden description -- you're right, it's definitely NOT a beer garden. But there is no official description that claims as much. It's officially referred to as a rooftop brewpub. The term beer garden gets thrown around way too much these days and I think sometimes it unfortunately gets attached to places that don't fit that description.

It will be open all year round- It's more of a place to just hang out - I realized while waiting downstairs for 15/20 mins and coming in to a half empty hall that they are preventing it from turning into the stereotypical beer garden.

5.0,6/20/2011,"Some of the reviews for this place should be thrown out. If you're rating based on price or the wait-time, you shouldn't be living in NYC. Its an affordable luxury by a celebrity chef and is accessible to tourists. What do you expect? Ratings should be based on actual food, service, ambiance and overall experience. I solidly rate Birreria 5-stars. My fiancee and I went on Friday afternoon (3pm) and opted for a spot at the bar rather than the wait-list for a table. This place is huge and unlike most bars/restaurants is kept AT capacity so there is actual walking space and people are not hovering 6 rows deep to get food or drinks. This also helps to keep the noise level down. The frosted roof (when closed) gives the place a lovely (non-humid) green house effect. It mutes the light nicely but still makes you feel like you're outside. The cask beers are $10 (as mentioned in other reviews) but they are also very inventive, delicious and STRONG. Don't drink the beer unless you actually enjoy drinking beer because this is not the kind of beer made for keg stands and chugging. For a light lunch, we decided to share a 3-cheese plate and the skirt steak. The cheese was delicious, especially the house made ricotta with honey. The skirt steak was the best I've ever had. Completely tender, cooked perfectly medium rare and served on a well seasoned salsa verde. The staff was BEYOND friendly and informative. We were amazed at the attention and explanations and amount of ""tastings"" that they gave to everyone at the bar. Beer may be $10/pint but they make sure you like it before you buy it.

2.0,6/13/2011,"The Good The cheese platter for $17, good selection of beer, the pork shoulder, and the kale salad with anchovy dressing and grapefruit. Service is on-point...but with a squadron of bus boys, it's pretty to easy to expect that your water glass always be filled and your napkin always properly folded when you return to your seat. The Bad:You wait in line to...wait in line some more. Yup.  The wait to get up to The Playboy Club at The Palms is probably faster and less confusing than this place. You put your name down so they can text you to let you know when you can come up; there are two lists: one for the bar and the other for dinner. I suggest you put your name on the bar list since you can ask for a table when you get upstairs. Oh and if you have a large party, make sure you're ALL there, because you won't be seated and if you're already seated, you can't add a chair or move tables. More on this later.The Ugly:Remember what I said about not being seated if your group isn't all there? It's apparently to make sure the flow of seating doesn't get disrupted...which is really funny because when you get upstairs, after waiting in line for what feels like forever, you see empty tables instead of a packed rooftop. We learned this the hard way: I decided on a ""surprise"" birthday dinner for my boyfriend this past weekend for a party of 8. Four of us arrived ahead of everyone else and decided to grab a table after standing around for a while. We thought we could just add on people to our table or be re-seated at a bigger table because...well, nearly half the place was empty. Wrong. So we thought, ok, the other four can take our seats and order food so they don't have to wait for seats. Um, wrong again. We apparently would throw off their seating flow if we had 4 people order more food at a table that was already being used, thereby saving them a 4-top. Makes sense right? To top things off, their dickish manager came by and curtly reprimanded us for trying to circumvent their house rules. Obviously the guy didn't want us dropping more money than the $200 four of us had just spent, because enforcing arcane, diner un-friendly rules was more important. Bottom line:Good food, great servers, bad management and a confusing seating system.",3,0,0,Nicole A.,"New York, NY",4,9,2
3.0,6/12/2011,"We went as a party of 4 on a Saturday afternoon. The beer garden opens at 5:30, so we got there about 5:15, and there was already a substantial line. As we got closer to the front, the guy asked if we were there for dining or drinking only, the difference being that diners could be seated right away, while drinkers would have to wait. OK, we're diners, we said.    After a quick elevator ride to the 14th floor, it was 3 more flights to the rooftop Birreria. The entire roof is a skylight, and the feeling is spacious and light, a gorgeous place.  Our waiter was well-intended, but he felt compelled to read the menu to us, when we had already seen it downstairs, and anyway, we know how to read. It appears that one requirement to work at Birreria is that you be covered with tattoos.   We figured the best deal on the menu was the ""piatto misto,"" for $85. It's a literal sausage fest, with samples of each of 5 sausages, plus my favorite, a nice chunk of roast pork shoulder. Came with coarse mustard and 2 sides. The sides were quite skimpy for 4 people, and the menu said it was intended for five! Our sides were roast fennel and a mustardy potato salad. They were both great; wish there had been more.    We enjoyed a carafe of pilsner, and then one of IPA. Both were just fine. We didn't order dessert, and I'm not sure they offered any.

2.0,6/9/2011,"This is a based on it only being open for a week.   They really need to get their act together in terms of seating/letting people upstairs/etc.    Was meeting friends at 5:45 , and running late so told my friends to go up without me.    They were told to wait and were eventually let up to the bar area which had plenty of room.   When I got there, tried to go up but was told that I had to wait in line like everyone else.   I got to the front of the line(waited about 15 minutes) was let immediately up, and the funny part was when I got upstairs there were at least 5 barstools open as well as a few table and plenty of bar space.  Perhaps they should have a bar line and a restaurant line, and let the bar line stream up continuously until full.   It is frustrating to wait and then finally get upstairs to realize that there was room all along.Anyway- decent beer selection, very limited food.   We ordered a cheese plate which was good (a little pricy, but it is Eataly), pretzel.  I wouldn't come back without a reservation or if they decide to clean up their seating/letting people up system.",1,1,0,Molly G.,"New York, NY",12,45,0

Yeah I get that it just opened up last week and that a wait is expected, but to not let me go upstairs to the beer garden with the wine and cheese I just bought at the bar downstairs is absurd.

3.0,6/7/2011,"Often of an evening, I'll decide to stretch my legs on a walk, make my way up Broadway, oh look -- the Flatiron is so pretty, and, oh, here we are at Eataly, why not enjoy the beauty as an art gallery?  This has happened about ten times, and I had still never purchased anything.  Rounding a corner to face another interminable line, someone called out my name, and they were almost in front, just giving their reservation to the hostess at Birreria.  (BTW: ""beer-a-RI-a"" or ""beer-AIR-ee-ah""?  The first sounds too much like diarrhea...not a good association...)  So I joined in.The outdoor setting is protected by windows, retractable ceiling, and the surprising light-out upper floors of surrounding buildings.  So it is not the view of a lifetime, but very nice to feel the summer breeze and let it playfully lift your hair.  (Well, that breeze was also having its way with the wine glasses, blasting them off the cart and shattering them with fantastic pops.)  I had the golden IPA, which was perfect, saturated but not overly grassy with hops.  I sipped others' DFH peche, dark cask IPA, and the dark highest-alcohol one that of course came in a fancy goblet.  I also had bites of the bottom three cheeses on the menu, the excellent pork shoulder, the weird potato salad that accompanied it, and plenty of good chewy sourdough bread.  It's definitely not your average beer garden -- there are no trees, you have your own table, there's quite a variety of beers, and there's no kielbasa in site -- but nice for a lively drink and bite, less harried than the scene downstairs.",1,0,1,Claire V.,"New York, NY",13,173,0
4.0,6/5/2011,"This place just became a definite go-to for the summer.  Went there on Saturday night around 8:30pm.  Gave name and cell phone number to the guy at the front and then went to browse the rest of Eataly while waiting for our table.  It was definitely crowded but given that this was Birreria's opening weekend, not surprising.After a bit of a wait, got a text message that the table was ready - once upstairs you can tell the place definitely has style.  Great rooftop views of the surrounding buildings.  It's noisy up there when it's full but not so bad that you can't have a conversation.  Since it was opening weekend Batali was there, so we specifically requested a table that would allow us to stare awkwardly at him.  The hostess politely obliged.As for the beer, we tried the Eataly Thyme Pale Ale and the Eataly Indian Brown Ale, both very good.  For the food, we had the shrimp (served w/ heads on) and the pork chop.  Shrimp was flavorful but a little over-salted, and the pork chop was one of the best I've had.So is there anything bad about the place?  Well like the rest of Eataly, it's fairly expensive for what you get - the cask beers are $10 a pint and the portions of the food were a little lacking for the price.  But the quality of both the beer and the food is pretty high, so just know what you're getting into and you'll have a great time.  They're going to start taking group reservations in a few weeks and then I think this place will become a summer happy hour favorite of mine.P.S.

3.0,6/5/2011,"Birreria, which is what you will have in the morning after consuming too many fermented beverages, is the new Eataly beer garden, a partnership between the Batali/Bastianich foodie empire and the three craft brewers--Sam Calagione (aka God) of Dogfish Head, Leonardo Di Vincenzo of Del Borgo, Teo Musso of Baladin (awesome bottle font)--who refer to themselves as the Birreria brothers. Try pronouncing that word after drinking a few pints of their product. Better yet, ask your Japanese friends to say it (and then again when *they're* drunk). The idea here was to create an awesome new addition to what is already the most enormous speciality food purveyance emporium in the known universe.I was so eager to visit, I stood in line the first day it opened for 2 hours, ultimately giving up when I was told there would be another 3 hour wait. I returned early the next day and made it in with the first wave of people at 5:30. Leaving after 8 pm later, there was still quite a long line--they only let eight people in every 5 minutes, and I have to say, it never felt particularly crowded on the rooftop despite the hordes of people trying to get in. So kudos for that.Let me explain why I'm only giving Birreria three stars, despite its fine, rooftop location (with a view of nothing, by the way), my obsession with craft beer (particularly Dogfish Head), and the high standard of food, drink, and service ensured by the Batali (fellow Rutgers paison) imprimatur.Number one, it's too hard to get in. This will likely change when the initial euphoria dies down and the place opens for lunch (and, uniquely for a ""beer garden,"" accepts reservations), but, then again, the initial euphoria over Eataly still seems pretty euphoric, and it's unlikely that Eataly's perfect storm of tourist shitshow and location at the b&t douchebag crossroads of New York will abate any time soon. Their bottom line is probably counting on it.Number two, they haven't quite figured out the proper formula for a beer garden atmosphere. Birreria is more like a fancy restaurant that attempts to look down market (cheap looking red chairs) but serves expensive beer and food. I guess the yuppies and tourists can delight in the idea they're slumming it by drinking outside (not really, since the ""garden"" is fully enclosed) and eating typical bar foods (with exotic Italian names and premium ingredients, like a pork sausage containing gelatinous pig skin) in a festive, public garden environment (which is, again, hard to get into and quite expensive, so not exactly a venue for the general populace). You usually expect long tables in a beer garden, but Birreria is mostly a restaurant with regular table service and a marble bar on one side where you will probably not get a seat. OK, if that's what they want. The restaurant service is almost too good. I felt like 15 people were solely dedicated to our table. They were very sweet, but it was overbearing. One of them kept removing my coaster whenever I didn't have a drink. Dude, I'm getting another drink; you can remove the used coaster when I leave. Maybe I'm harping too much on the ""beer garden"" idea, but I do think too many restaurants are opening in New York that attempt to fake some sort of authentic style or atmosphere but just end up being as pretentious, expensive, and totally not-relaxing as all the others. Sorry to pick on you, Birreria. You're making a good effort, I suppose. Consider this friendly advice from a beer lover who is not at all averse to fine dining and good food but goes into a beer oriented establishment expecting something very specific. You're not there yet. Seriously, it's cool that you serve wine out of barrels, but beer in a carafe? Give me a break.Number three, it's too expensive for casual drinking. The beer is great and all, but $10 for a pint? That's fucking insane. It basically prices most people out of really enjoying this place except what I have to assume is their target market of rich assholes and trust funded hipsters (not, admittedly, much in evidence here). OK, you have a few $7 options, but the house brew and Birreria brothers craft options are what we're coming for, and, though a friend pointed out to me that $10 is not much more than the $6-8 beers you'll find at most New York bars, I countered that in dollar terms it's not much more, but in percentage terms it's like 50% more expensive (in true Eataly fashion, I guess), and if you have like 5-6 beers, that adds up. It's not nothing. And it's good beer, but it's not so fantastic it's worth the trouble and expense. The bottled beers they sell are also indicative of their pricing structure. A bottle of Dogfish Head Sah'tea, for example, one of my favorites generally costs around $10 or less at Whole Foods, etc. At Birreria, the same bottle will run you $24. I've heard of markups for wine, but 140%? Jesus Christ!The food menu looks OK, but I didn't eat much. Those house made sausages are basically just fancy hot dogs. $10.",15,8,3,Steven S.,"New York, NY",76,352,133
4.0,6/4/2011,"And Eataly finds a way to be even CRAZIER!  I went to the Italian themepark's opening day last year.  And yeah, things were equally nuts this time around.  No sign of Mr. Batali this time though.It was quite the ordeal to get in.  First there's the huge line...and little did we know, that was just the first line!  We still had to leave our name on a list and patiently wait for a text message.  Waited in total for about 2 hours.  Thank goodness there's Shake Shack where we got a bottle of their ""grape juice"" wine while we waited.  We sipped the juice while longingly looking at Eataly.  When will they text?  But, I have a feeling that many people thought that if they waited in line, they would immediately get in.  Wrong!Thankfully, they did, and we rushed over and took the elevator up to the top.  To our surprise, the place wasn't even packed!  Artificial demand ftl. Birreria is smaller than I thought it would be.  I really had expected it to span the entire rooftop of the building.  Alas, it only covers about two thirds.  The draft list is pretty impressive.  My favorite was the Super Baladin, which is a Belgian style ale.  Nice and strong.  They don't have the list on their website, but we ordered carafes of most of the beers on the menu.  And we also had a bottle of one of the Dogfish's Squall IPA.  The beers are pretty steep though, unfortunately.  A carafe, which is about 2 pints, typically costs between 14 and 20 bucks. We got a 7 cheese plate and some soppressata and pork shoulder sausage.  The blue cheese, I might add, is pretty amazing.  I don't even really like blue cheese, but this one in particular was pretty mild.  The cheese and salumi came with a plate with candied oranges and almond honey.  The almond honey, in particular, when drizzled on top of the sausage was pretty damn tasty.  Don't forget to ask for the freshly baked pretzels.Our server was really friendly and excited about the opening.  It was pretty crazy and he did a good job, although it took a while to get some of our beers.  We were also deeply disappointed that the ""prison beer"" had kicked.  So we didnt get to try it, but apparently, some prisoners make the beer as part of their prison tasks.  Beats making license plates, I guess.Whoever put together the playlist yesterday did a great job.  They only played good songs.My main issue with Birreria though, is that I thought it was going to be more of a beer garden and not so much a restaurant.  It really has a restaurant feel to it, which is kinda disappointing.  I wish there were more tables near the bar too, because not everyone wants to eat or order some cheese/salumi.  Sometimes, we just want to drink some really good beer.  I'll return, but probably only when the hype dies  down, although I kinda doubt it will really die down this summer.  Yeah I may come back sooner than I thought because that Baladin beer was just so damn tasty.",5,0,1,Victor S.,"Brooklyn, NY",319,314,11
