5.0,4/9/2019,"My BF surprised me for our Vday dinner and was impressed with the festive decor, elegant seating and fancy feathers on the wall, just simple elegance.  The resto is situated in the Flatiron district near Theodore Roosevelt's birthplace, which was pretty awesome.  Our waiter from the start was enthusiastic about the menu and was top notch in service.  For starters, we ordered the Main lobster salad (boiled to perfection) and foie gras creme brûlée with the mouthwatering sweet and savory flavors. We paired our meal with the suggested wine pairing and it pulled all the flavors amazingly.  Our main dishes were slow cooked Alaskan halibut and stuffed brune landaise ballotine, both were standouts.  We've never had brune landaise ballotine, which was aged chicken wrapped in pork meat and bathed in truffle reduction sauce, splendid indeed. The gnocchi that accompanied the halibut was divine and the saffron sauce added a bit of oomph to the tasty fish dish.  Our desserts were a bit too tarty, such as the sorbet that accompanied the chocolate tart. Nevertheless it was a delicious dessert to cleanse one's palate.  Coming into this restaurant not knowing their speciality protein is chicken was a pleasant surprise because the non chicken dishes are worth a try.",1,0,0,Sonia Mae B.,"Harlem, Manhattan, NY",145,90,196
5.0,3/4/2019,"The chook is out of the henhouse: le Coq Rico serves the best bird in nyc. Personal favorite is the Plymouth Rock, but there's a bird on the menu for every palate.

4.0,3/4/2019,"Dining at Le Coq Rico is an interesting experience. It's a beautiful restaurant with excellent service, and most of the dishes are meant to share...like the birds. The food was delicious, though very expensive for...chicken...but I get it, you're getting some sort of high quality bird that you can't get at any supermarket. My friends and I shared the deviled eggs and the leek vinaigrette salad as our appetizers. When we were deciding on the bird, the waiter said each one feeds 2-3 people. I was dining with three other GUYS (yes, this is important), so we went with the Brune Landaise bird and also ordered the regular, entree-sized orange duck to share, along with the fries. Saying the bird feeds UP TO THREE people was such a joke. We barely finished it and 3/4 of the diners were MEN! I'm not going to lie, I felt a little ripped off being told it wouldn't be enough food for everyone. The brune was pretty good, as was the duck and the fries.Be prepared to spend a decent amount of money, especially if you're drinking! Overall, I enjoyed the experience at Le Coq, and next time I'll order a tad less.",4,1,3,Jackie S.,"New York, NY",1004,802,3287
2.0,3/1/2019,"This restaurant has changed. The principal owner has left as has the chef.The eggs meurette which used to be outstanding was just adequate. The egg had been poached before and was cold and flavorless. The wine sauce was unfocused and bland.The chicken was tasteless and over poached. The fries were still good.Ike flottante was still excellent.The service was awful.Where before they had a charming maitre d' and a sommelier, this waiter was coarse and rushed us along although the place was 2/3 full. All of the waiters stood speaking to each other, loud enough to hear.I used to love eating here and have been many times. The food was excellent and the place was not stuffy.

4.0,2/21/2019,"Stuffed Brune Landaise chicken (120days) - 9/10. The chicken tasted really different.The squab (7.5/10) - similar to Beef of Wellington. The taste of squab was not that prominent. My rating on this dish is relative to the squab dish (@ Aquavits). No wow factor.The I'ile Flotantte (dessert) (10/10). Light and soft meringue in creamy custard (with vanilla dash). No disappoint. Try not to lick the plate lol.Mille feuille (dessert) (9.5/10). Very light, thin, flaky, crispy. The cream was really good (not too sweet).

3.0,2/18/2019,$80+ is bit much for rotisserie chicken. We got the Plymouth Rock whole chicken. Decent chicken but I wasn't wowed by it. Veggie side for $13 was also a bit overpriced for a small ordinary bowl of veggies. The waiter didn't tell us that the chicken comes with a salad. We would have skipped the side if we had known.,2,1,2,Alan V.,"Alexandria, VA",37,95,573
5.0,2/15/2019,"Found this place on 'Best Thing I Ever Ate'. Geoffrey Zakarian describes it as ""this is how chicken is supposed to taste"". And he was right! Made a reservation here for my birthday just to order the same thing! The ambience is sexy and simple. My Mom pointed out the art on the wall made complete of egg shells. We thought that was clever. Our server was fantastic and super friendly. We ordered the truffle risotto as our appetizer - and it was the best risotto I've ever had! So delicious! Then we ordered the morel sauce with the bird, Mac and cheese and mushrooms. It was amazing!! We all could not believe how great this chicken was!! For dessert, I tried the Madagascar Vanilla ice cream and it was the best ice cream I've ever had! Traveled all the way from Orlando FL to dine here - and it did not disappoint! We will be back!

5.0,1/14/2019,"First time visit 1/12/2019.  We spotted this place about a month ago and stopped by for a drink before attending a birthday and made a note to come back and try their interesting menu.  Once seated, our experience was seamless.  We had counter seats and started off with cocktails and the Egg Meurette and Foie.  The egg was perfectly jammy and was consumed all too quickly.  The foie was like butter.  The bread and butter was great too but I didn't want to chance filling myself up with it.  After speaking to our server, Issy, on our preferences about poultry (dark meat flavor fans) it was decided that we order the Guinea fowl with the morel sauce.  His suggestions were on point.  We enjoyed the fowl thoroughly and the salad it came with..it's exactly what I look for - simply prepared, the right amount of acid to cut through the richness of your meal. The Chenin Blanc was gorgeous as well.  We loved our meal and hope to go back again!",1,0,0,Kane K.,"Jersey City, NJ",0,72,0
5.0,12/27/2018,"Delicious chicken. Yes It's a chicken house. Tho I did not come here that. I came here for the ""seared Foie Gras"". Sounds unusual but it was darn delicious. Sat on the counter and I could see the chef preparing my appetizer for me. It was one of the Best Foie gras I have ever had. Tho I was not a fan of the Apple. When I had called they told me it was peaches and almonds. Online it said peaches and hazelnuts. When I arrived it ended up being apples and almonds. If the apples had been poached I think it would go better with the dish as there were too many crunchy elements in the dish. Overall it was still a great dish minus the apples. Will definitely come back next time I'm in NYC!",0,0,0,Ms. E.,"Arlington, VA",6,68,428
5.0,12/24/2018,"The Bistro of Beautiful Birds, Poultry Paradise, Heaven of the chickens, or any other surreal and intangible name and description, you name it; the modern French bistro, Le Coq Rico is it, all of it. Located in the Flatiron District of New York City, Le Coq Rico New York, the second restaurant to the name after its original location in Paris, serves up an extravagant and seemingly over the top yet glorious menu of flawlessly raised chickens and birds. The upscale bistro luxuriously focuses on poultry with many options and possibilities to satisfy groups of all sizes, guaranteeing a hedonistic dining experience.Walking into Le Coq Rico, guests are exposed to the bar, some counter seats and its smooth and glossy black countertop. The utilization of colors that range from the scale of white to black renders an elegant visual and essence to the overall image. As guests continue walking in, there are several tables for two on the left and a beautifully lit glass wine storage on the right. Guests then enter into one of the two dining areas - the main room with whitewashed brick walls and stylized design and décor. The other dining area is a counter; bar-like setting that overlooks the open kitchen. The use of mirrors on the wall in the back of the restaurant and reflective materials on the walls throughout the bistro visually creates an infinitely larger space. It also adds on to the restaurant's sleek and modern interior design.To start off, you can choose from many options for appetizers and small bites. There are eggs, salads, soup, foies, terrines and giblets. The Iron Chefs' Choice winner, Leek Vinaigrette is a great salad to begin your dinner. Served over a pool of Hollandaise sauce, each bite of the leeks and vegetables was guaranteed a rich and creamy taste. The russet pomme allumette (fried russet potatoes in the shape of matchsticks) placed atop gave the salad an extra crunch it needed. The Terrine en Croûte of Duck Foie Gras is a slice of buttery puff pastry, which enwraps duck liver pâté and aspic. The duck foie gras is super silky-smooth and rich in flavors. The chicken stock infused gelatin; aspic, is placed on top of each slab of terrine for not only decorative purposes, but it does contribute an additional layer of flavor and texture.There is a list of chicken breeds to pick from including Brune Landaise, Plymouth Rock, Rohan Farm Duck, Cornish, Catskill Guinea Fowl, New Hampshire, and Jersey Giant to share amongst bigger groups. Guests can also choose to order different mains, to try out different birds without having to commit to a whole bird. The Brune Landaise Quarter, a quarter of the chicken, is raised for 120 days, poached and roasted to perfection. The meat is firm yet still soft and extremely moist, and using the provided au jus brought each bite beyond what you would expect. The Thomas Farm Squab comes as a baked pie or pastry-like dish, with the squab and en croûte on the inside of a beautifully cooked puff pastry, served over a side of potato purée and drizzled with jus reduction. The whole dining experience becomes a tribute to the birds. There are many details and décor, magnified and amplified by the mirrors, that transforms the restaurant into a heavenly space. There are grouped feathers in squares hung as art, visually warming up the whitewashed brick wall. Feathers dangling above each table and the shadows casted create a hypnotizing effect and definitely a serene and relaxing atmosphere to enjoy the amazingly delicious food. You can see the blue carving of a bird hung on a wall and lit up all around the edges, which ironically, brings some life into the dining room. It almost feels as if it would make some sounds, which would then be echoed across the room.They serve classically French desserts; L'ile Flottante, Wild Strawberries Soufflé, Peach Melba, Vanilla Millefeuille, and many more. The Wild Strawberries Soufflé is amazing but to go above and beyond, the L'ile Flottante is indeed a must-order! It honestly should be the first and only (if only getting one) dessert that you order. It translates to Floating Island in English and is a perfect sphere of meringue resting gently in the center of a bowl of crème anglaise topped with pink praline almonds and dusted caramel sugar. The crème anglaise is rich, creamy and might be a bit heavy on its own, but with the meringue, it gives each spoonful the lightness and soft texture. To contrast, the quick ""melt in your mouth"" texture of the whipped egg whites, the caramel sugar and slivered almonds give it the perfect crunch. This is definitely the ultimate simple yet elegant French dessert to ideally end your night of feasting.After a night with an incredible dining experience at Le Coq Rico, you will feel as if you've experienced beyond a state of happiness. From the moment of entering, guests have already risen to some kind of elevated poultry paradise. And everything just goes up and gets better from there.",1,0,0,Tom L.,"Brooklyn, NY",128,129,935

Even though we were totally wrecked when we walked out of the restaurant, the feeling of bloated and fullness does not stop me from loving it.  It's juicy, tender, perfectly roasted chicken.  When I had my first bite, the first thing that came to my mind is: I have to bring my family to this restaurant.

Tender, moist and flavorful. At the waiter's recommendation, we also ordered the duck.  It was horrible.  It was tough and lacked any flavor.  I do not want to even conjecture what happened in its preparation.   The restaurant attempted to make up for this additional desert and after dinner drinks.

Ordered the duck rillettes, Schneiderspatle and the mushroom and spinach fricassee. The duck rillettes was bland. The Schneiderspatle was good, but was quite dry. There was a minuscule amount of poultry jus and the sour cream was undetectable. There was nothing ""fricassee"" about the mushroom and spinach fricassee. This tiny side dish is nothing more than a handful of sautéed mushrooms with a couple of spinach leaves for $15. It had no sauce, was dry and under seasoned.

1.0,11/11/2018,Wow. Expensive and ambitious. But if they can't cook a $109 chicken right why attempt it? Great French fries and salad but after asking three times to the sever if the chicken was cooked a day ahead or  the day I had  ate it and then not eating any of it you would think server would understand your dish is not good. No chance. Fully billed and food seriously poorly executed and dry I am sad to say Whole  foods roasted chicken is much better and 1/10th the price.,0,0,0,Snake F.,"San Francisco, CA",0,24,0

3.0,11/10/2018,"I had my friend's birthday dinner here on a Tuesday. The ambiance was beautiful full of interesting decor such as feathers and egg shells. We all shared the Rohan Farm duck for 3 which came nicely prepared. We also ordered an extra sauce, Coq au Vin, not knowing that it came with au jus. Both were subtle and delicious. There was minimal fat and the focus was more on the tender duck breast meat. But I was upset they did NOT include the duck legs because we paid $84 for the ""whole"" duck. For a side, we ordered Ratatouille. It was delicious and loaded with eggplant. For dessert we shared a Chocolate Profiterole which was kind of boring despite being a huge fan of chocolate. It wasn't too sweet. The ice cream texture was fluffy like pudding. But I wouldn't recommend. Service was poor. Our waiter, who was incredibly charming, would disappear for a very long time. I had higher expectations. I didn't think this was a spectacular meal and I'm not dying to return.",3,1,2,Melanie R.,"New York, NY",88,232,485
3.0,10/19/2018,"This is a beautiful French restaurant apparently known for their chicken dishes, but I was more won over by their appetizers than their chicken. For appetizers we ordered the Leeks Vinaigrette, the Giblets Platter, Deviled Eggs, and Ducks Rillette. I loved the soft texture of the leeks and the savoriness of the Hollandaise sauce. I recommend the Giblets platter to share with a group even if not everyone in the group enjoys eating offal, as it also comes with wings and croquettes. But of course I enjoyed the giblets the most. The deviled eggs comes in a set of 3, but you can add an extra for $4. For our chicken dish, we ordered the Chef's Specialty Westermann's Baeckeoffe for 4 people. Someone first came out with the earthenware to present the dish. They then took the earthenware back and divided everything into four portions. The flavor of the jus was great, but presentation-wise it was a let down. For some reason I thought it would be a roast chicken, but the dish ended up being a stewed chicken with artichokes and potatoes. The texture of the chicken was a extremely tender to the point where it was a little bit too soft for me. There was also an incredible amount of potatoes and not enough artichoke and other vegetables. It could be that because they pre-portioned the dish for us, my bowl did not get the vegetables and the other bowls did. The service befits the beautiful interior. I saw another table order roast chicken options and it looked and smelled delicious. I hope to try that next time.",13,9,9,Jocelyn K.,"Jersey City, NJ",479,885,4955
4.0,10/14/2018,"This is a steakhouse for chicken, or more accurately a ""fowlhouse"" since they treat all fowl as reverently as a prime steakhouse treats its beef.  The name, I believe, is a play on the French pronunciation of cock-a-doodle-doo, or cocorico.  Anyhow, this is the US sibling to the original which is in Montmatre, Paris, and Chef Westermann is a Michelin 3-star chef.  Nice!Here, of course, you get fowl.  Get the deviled eggs as an appetizer too, they come before the chicken ... or do they?The food here is excellent, and the birds are tasty.  These aren't your typical Perdue birds either.  All their birds are heritage breeds, organically and humanely raised, and cooked by poaching then roasting.  The selection of available fowl varies.  The signature dish is a whole chicken that is cooked Alsatian style in a clay pot.The floating island dessert is awesome.  Lives up to the hype.Just don't cry foul when you see the bill - this place is pricey!",3,0,1,Eric Y.,"La Grange, IL",60,573,2

3.0,8/19/2018,"Came here for their Restaurant Week lunch menu on a Friday afternoon. You can make a reservation online but it wasn't necessary if you get here when they open at 12pm.I ordered the Deviled Eggs as my appetizer and the Plat Du Jour (Duck Leg Confit that day) as my entrée. I was disappointed that dessert wasn't included. Although it's listed on the Restaurant Week menu, you can only choose 2 out of 3 options. I thought it was a little too good to be true to get an appetizer, entrée, AND dessert for $26 but they should've specified on the menu to avoid any confusion.The deviled eggs were good but nothing special. The duck was a little overcooked but the skin was nice and crispy. I would've preferred my meat to be more tender though so I'd give this a 3 out of 5 stars. My friend ordered their famous chicken (Brune Landaise) which I also tried. I rank it a 3 as well because even though it wasn't overcooked, it wasn't anything special. I had high expectations for chicken that's been marinated for 120 days but unfortunately at the end of the day, it just tasted like any other marinated chicken. I've had better for half the price.They also offered a wine pairing for $8 which seemed like a better deal.

4.0,8/19/2018,"Went here with a friend to check out their Summer 2018 restaurant week menu. We wanted to try as many things as possible so we split each course.Deviled Eggz (4 stars): These were a bit unique as they were paired with octopus and a really great cumin salad--though the egg itself was pretty standard.Chicken and Duck terrine (3.5 stars): This was decent--not my favorite--but good nonetheless.Rohan duck leg (4.5 stars): This was very good and the pairing of the spices and crust was delicious--decent size as well.Stuffed brune landaise chicken (4.5 stars): The chicken here was very good, but we actually enjoyed the gnocchi and veggie mix even more.L'ile flottante (3.5 stars): This was a refreshing dessert on a hot night, but nothing to write home about.Homemade sorbet/ice cream--Vanilla, caramel, dark chocolate (4 stars): All of these flavors were very good, but I think that the caramel was the best. Unfortunately they were a little more melted than I would have liked by the time they got to the table.Overall, this place definitely serves up some great food. Restaurant week is a great deal as many of these dishes are upwards of $40 per person on an average night. The service was friendly and attentive and the food came out quickly.

3.0,8/12/2018,"3.5 stars. I came during Restaurant Week, so maybe that's why my dinner wasn't as outstanding as expected. My order: devilled eggz, Rohan duck leg, and l'ile flottante for dessert.The devilled eggz were delicious but aside from the interesting combination with octopus, it tasted mostly like other devilled egg dishes I've had. The Rohan duck leg was possibly one of the least photogenic entrees I've ever seen, but it was quite good as well - the duck is breaded and embedded with various nuts and spices. Very odd looking (I'll choose the best photo I have and add a filter to make it more palatable) but tasted fine. The l'ile flottante was not up my alley, however. It was my first time having one and I'm sure it was an objectively good version of a l'ile flottante, but the meringue looked and tasted like a styrofoam ball to me even though the creme anglaise was wonderful. Did not finish it, which was probably the second time ever I've not finished a restaurant dessert. But again, I want to emphasise that I think it's just because I don't like this form of meringue, not because it was poorly prepared.Service was a little slow even for a table of 6, and they frequently overlooked our water glasses. The starter bread was phenomenal. It may actually have been my favourite part of the whole meal.I'd definitely come back to try a whole bird though.",0,1,0,Millie S.,"Manhattan, NY",384,284,415

3.0,7/31/2018,"We found Le Coq Rico on the NYC Restaurant Week website and decided to give it a try since we hadn't had French food in a while. For the Prix Fix Menu, we had: Starters: - Chicken & Duck Terrine: Very good, would order this again!- Deviled Eggs: Also very good, only 2 halves served, wish it was biggerMain:- Rohan Duck Leg W/ Oriental Crust - Cooked well. Crust was good, sauce had no taste.- Quarter Brune Landaise - Meat was tasty, salad was very good.Dessert: - I'ile Flottante - This was perfect! Custard was very light and sweet and had lots of flavor.In addition to the fixed menu, we order some bar drinks (both were good), Duck en Croute, and French Fries. The Croute was decent, but the jam served with it was quite sour and didn't work too well with it- wouldn't order again. The fries were soft and completely flavorless- bad enough where I had to request Ketchup to try and fix them up a bit (maybe the oil needed to be changed?). Have had better from a fast food place for a quarter of the price.Upon arrival, we were seated at the kitchen counter which was pretty cool until the chefs started cooking. It then got too hot for us and we requested to be moved to normal seating. After the move, we were okay but the service in this section was not too good. For the size of the place, the amount of tables, and the amount of staff, you would expect much more. In regards to the staff cleaning the tables and refilling the water and delicious bread, these guys were on-point and very pleasant. The part that got to me the most was that we were never offered a beverage menu with our dessert and our waiter was nowhere to be found until we had finished (then offered drink menu). Though we didn't experience many service problems beyond this, the couple next to us did. They had ordered wine before dinner and coffee after dinner and had to ask for it 2-3 times- both drinks arriving after they had finished their dishes.Overall, i'm not too sure if I would come back here. We spent nearly $200 and left full, but not completely satisfied. Maybe my expectations were too high going in, but I feel that if my meal costs $100+ a person, it should be perfect in all aspects. I hate to let the service and a few dishes bring the rest of a good meal down, but they just weren't up to par.",0,0,0,Ryan T.,"Queens, NY",6,127,132
4.0,7/29/2018,"Very good choice for Restaurant Week, and I definitely want to come back. The stuffed chicken main was incredible and the Ile flottante dessert absolutely delicious as well. The appetizers were a bit oversalted and underwhelming. I tried the eggz and terrine, but would skip both and stick to the chicken and dessert. I also had the Firefly Rose cocktail, it was a bit too sweet and in retrospect a nice white wine would have gone better with the meal.Accessibility: accessible entrance, didn't use the bathroom so can't comment.",1,0,0,Anna P.,"Manhattan, NY",167,46,20
4.0,7/25/2018,"Outstanding. My buddy and I came here for NYC Restaurant Week. They had a nice choice for main courses and you then add either an app or dessert. I started with a salad. Great, fresh tasting dressing. Then I went with the plat du jour which today was a chicken ""burger"". It's not actually. It's a nice piece of chicken breast on a homemade brioche bun with a yummy sweet relish. Service was very good. The food was great until dessert. The peach melba was a bit tasteless. Neither of us finished. It tasted like it had been in the back of the fridge for too long. And the peach just wasn't sweet. As I told the waiter, that's the chance you take with fresh fruit, but maybe the better choice is to not offer it.",2,0,1,Michael D.,"New York, NY",8,39,32

I'm tempted to give this more stars than I should only because of idiot chicken woman. That said, this is a hard review because I love the idea, the place, and I LOVE seeing André Soltner walk around there, acting like it's his place not his grandson's. I mean, come on, legend! I've been now 9 or 10 times and the problem is its inconsistency. Now, sometimes it's the fault of the bird, sometimes it's my fault. Chicken is one of my favorite things but I don't love a really strong bird and that's my palate's bad. But it's definitely worth the work to get in. I don't love the smaller dishes, except for the egg with Bernaise but then again, Bernaise. The leeks with vinaigrette is a French classic and no one in NY does it as well. The chicken liver is divine. But I haven't had a salad I liked yet and way too much salt in all of them. Period. And I like salt. VERY disappointed in the rillets and terrine but the seared foie is wonderful. Pass on the sides, even the morels. God I love morels. Not these. And I don't love the ratatouille this way. I've had most of the birds and you're just going to have to figure that shit out on your own but love his special, the stuffed Brune and the crazy Alsatian ""ravioli.""Overall, I just want this to be better and more often.

5.0,5/7/2018,"Went here for lunch. At 12PM there were plenty of open tables. Many of the staff are French, which adds to the authenticity of the place. Ask to sit in ""the kitchen"" so you sit at the bar and watch the dishes come to life and see how the workers interact with each other - it's a great experience. The pricing for lunch is very reasonable; we had the chicken sandwiches and broth for $16/pp. While the food was very good, we were too full from appetizers, so we didn't finish all of our food. The manager stopped by to make sure everything was okay because he thought we didn't like something. (A nice touch.)

3.0,5/6/2018,"3.5 stars.  Overall enjoyable meal and very friendly service, although portion sizes were smaller than we expected.We started with the slow-cooked duck egg, which was perfectly cooked and nicely done.  For our mains, we went for the Rohan Farm Duck and also a single serving of the Brune Landaise (quarter chicken) just so we could try some of the chicken too.  The birds were not the most tender/juicy that I've had, but they were nicely flavored, and the jus on the side was great.  We were told the duck is a good portion size for 3 people, but our party of 2 pretty much cleaned it all up, along with the quarter chicken.  Unfortunately they don't include the duck legs and use it to make duck confit for their lunch menu.  For the price, I would've loved to get some duck confit, or to at least have the duck legs to complete the duck.For dessert, the standout item was the I'Ile Flottante, which is a soft meringue.  It's beautifully plated, and I don't typically like meringue, but hats off to this one.  The profiteroles were good but less special for me, despite being a chocolate lover.  The profiteroles themselves were fine (2 chocolate ice cream, 2 chocolate coulis), but the best part of this dessert for me wasn't the profiteroles but the almond and hazelnut praline at the bottom.",4,0,1,Yvonne C.,"Manhattan, NY",76,383,987
3.0,4/17/2018,"I had high expectations before coming in because this place is supposed to have the best birds cuisines. However, the experience fell a little short.Food:The cooked dishes are flavorful but all heavily salted. Especially the chicken morels dish... I couldn't really enjoy the wonderful and earthy flavor of the morels mushroom because my taste buds were numb by all the salt. The squab pie was an interesting dish if you like Beef Wellington. The meat was nicely cooked to medium rare and the puree in the bottom was tasty. The duck liver terrine was supposed to be award winning, it was good, but it did not wow me.Their hand cut fries tho... is the real reason why I've decided to give it 3 stars only. I believe I've had better fries from a McDonald's. It was just really soggy... when a restaurant doesn't make their simple dish right... why would you want to taste their fancy dishes?

While everything we ordered was delicious, I found the menu to be awkward.  One example is how you can order scrambled eggs only for $10 but sausage is part of a brunch special served with potatoes.  In my mind, I would expect sausage to be choice under sides.  Everyone's favorite dish was the Rohan Farm Duck for 3.  With the amount of food we ordered, it served 4.  The duck was tender, juicy and very tasty.  While I enjoyed the food, ambiance and excellent service, I wouldn't rush back due to the set up of the menu.",1,0,1,Masumi T.,"New York, NY",106,412,131

Fascinating to taste the subtle differences.

Half a chicken was enough for two of us. Three of us couldn't finish one whole bird, which came with perfectly crisp fries. The foie en croute is fabulously rich, and the leek appetizer is so delicate and lovely. We actually took the leftover chicken home for sandwiches the next day, and we made the loveliest chicken stock with the rest. The gift that keeps on giving!And the desserts! Not only decadent and mouthwatering, but so beautiful. You MUST have the Floating Islands. It's worth going just for this dessert and a drink. And then you have to have the chocolate profiteroles.

They serve it whole, in a roasting pan, and they claim it's for two with leftovers. There were two of us, but there weren't any leftovers. It's served with a crisp, fresh green salad and a jug of pan juice. Their french fries are a nice accompaniment. Other stuff we had was great too, but the chicken is why you're there.

The theme is clearly chicken and you can get these amazing family style dishes with a whole chicken or duck. Unfortunately, it just being the two of us, a whole chicken may have been too much. So I opted for the quarter chicken with fries and my wife had the chicken sausage. I have to say that my wife didn't like the chicken sausage at all - it was quite slimey. I loved my chicken - it was perfectly cooked and came with a lovely gravy. The only issue was that I didn't get my fries and for the first time ever, nobody checked how the meal was. I actually had to ask twice for the fries and once they had arrived I had finished the chicken. Fortunately they were kind enough not to charge me for them but that really disappointed. I almost forgot, the desert was incredible - mine was at least. A floating island of meringue in creme anglaise.

Decor was very minimalist highlighting their dedication to birds. And not just normal birds, but French birds! - The waiters greeted in French to remind us of that. - Oeufs en Meurette: Traditional Burgundian dish, poached eggs in red wine sauce. The wine flavor definitely stood out and lingered, onions and mushrooms cooked to a perfect texture. Highly recommend. - Whole chicken (100 days): It was certainly a big one, as the five of us hardly finished. Appreciate the fact that they asked for preference, cut pieces and added a slice of garlic for everyone. The most tender chicken breast I'd had in a while. Sauce was on the salty side, nothing too special. Complimentary vegetable salad to add some fiber. - Dessert 1: L'ile Flottante (floating island): Egg-based house specialty here. Creative presentation, easy to share, egg-white cream tasted like cloud floating on your tongue. Only downside: sweet almost to an extreme (at least that's the consent for half of the group)  - Dessert 2: Chocolate ice-cream + puff + biscuits + sth. else, different ways to eat chocolate all met here! Compared to the floating island, definitely a more balanced taste. Table's favorite.

3.0,1/1/2018,Lots of potential but fell short - dined during the last week of December 2017. There was hair on my girl friends dish and the waiter seemed disinterested or not very interested in being empathetic to the issue.The fries are over fried and quarter chicken was up to snuff.Not magical and would associate with a straightforward good lunch \ dinner.This is a Michelin star chefs who needs absolute more conventional discipline in the dining room,0,0,0,Didier A.,"Brooklyn, NY",96,3,0
5.0,12/31/2017,"I always like to end the year on a high note.I had the day off, so I decided to tick Le Coq Rico off my bookmarks list for lunch and it was a great decision.First impressions - the place is huge. There are two sides of the restaurant. If you get offered a seat at the chef's station, definitely take it. I love open kitchens. There's nothing like hearing chefs speaking French, and watching their mastery.They have a respectable beer selection as well as cocktails that they cleverly call Coq'tales. The cocktails seemed interesting, but it was a beer kinda day.For lunch, they have three distinct options, at different price points, and different time commitments.The first is the lunch combo, which is a chicken sandwich and soup at $16. The second is the plat du jour at $19. And the last is the prix fixe menu at $38, which is an appetizer, entree, and dessert. I highly recommend doing the prix fixe. Of course, you can also just order off the a la carte menu, which they also have available at lunch.For the prix fixe, I started with the deviled egg (which included octopus, cabbage and a cumin salad). The deviled eggs were among the best I've ever had. The salad was wonderful, with just the right amount of cumin flavor so as to not be overpowering. The octopus was also cooked perfectly. You could bite into them, but they were not at all rubbery.For my entree, I had to go with the Brune Landaise 120 day chicken. It was listed as a quarter chicken, but it was more like a half. There was a thigh, drumstick, and part of the breast. I'm a dark meat guy, but all of it was cooked perfectly. It also came with a brown sauce. The skin had an incredibly crisp to it and the meat fell off the bone. Bonus - if you sit near the street-end of the kitchen seating, you can watch birds on the rotisserie.For dessert, my waitress recommended the L'ile Flottante. I had no idea what it was, but it sounded fancy. Turns out it's a soft meringue ball floating in a custard (creme anglaise). It was light and fluffy, but also gigantic. Like the size of a softball. It was the only thing I didn't finish (not because I didn't want to, but because I hadn't been to the gym in like three weeks).Anyway, I highly recommend Le Coq Rico, if you want to treat yourself. Though with their many lunch menu items, you can make it a regular thing as well.#2800!",3,2,3,Kenny C.,"Brooklyn, NY",884,3337,12015

2.0,11/28/2017,This place is so over hyped. I love foie gras and all birds but wasn't really impressed for the cost. The food was just okay.  Their wine list is great though! I am giving only 2 stars because I was super disappointed to how difficult they were to work with allergies. I called ahead a few weeks to reserve a table and ensure they could accommodate our allergies in the group and the hostess reassured me she made a note and that they would set aside meats not pre marinated. I also told her exactly what we would have to make sure we could eat it. We arrive and our server tells me there's only one thing we can order - the fish- for our allergies. She had no record of me calling ahead. I had to speak to 3 people and finally the manager and they figured out a way to get us the foie without allergens. They seemed annoyed at us. I love fine dining for special occasions and frequent the other haute French places in town and would not come back here.

3.0,11/26/2017,"Thanksgiving 2017For Thanksgiving this year, we headed straight to the source; determined that if Le Coq Rico didn't have a good bird, few in the city must. This review specifically covers our experience at Thanksgiving. We arrived mid afternoon, and as expected they were very busy. Overall, the holiday offering was decent but far from perfect. All of the food seemed to have been prepared in advance and reheated for service. Nevertheless, the flavors were nice. I would be open to returning next Thanksgiving, but for a more relaxed experience, would suggest doing so after 4pm.Atmosphere- Cozy, but very modern bistro; streamlined luxe.- Parties of 4+ are seated in main dining area, there were only a few two top tables, with most parties of two seated along the bar area overlooking the kitchen.FoodWe had the Thanksgiving Dinner Prix Fixe ($90) which is one of the more attractively priced options in the city. Not sure if the normal menu was available - didn't see it.- Duck Foie Gras Terrine (Spices, Cranberry Chutney): Nice way of folding in Thanksgiving flavors, a good start.- Turkey Consomme & Black Truffle Ravioli: Tasty, but unremarkable - ravioli was nicely done.- Stuffed Heritage Turkey (Stuffing, Red Cabbage and Chestnut Fricassée, Celeriac Confit, Butternut & Citrus Purée): Loved it all except the celeriac. Excellent flavors and unique/updated take on the classics. This was all reheated for service, and got cold quickly.- Westermann's Gingerbread & Caramelized Apple Tart (Orange Sauce, Cottage Cheese Ice Cream): Tasty but again, nothing special.Though all of the flavors were nice, I honestly would have preferred they just offer the regular dinner menu (we have enjoyed it twice before) and a more normalized experience. Two of the four dishes were more or less very basic and uninventive, while the main course was reheated and got cold. Basically, everything fully prepared in advance, including the turkey.BeverageBegan with the Harry Rico (Passion Fruit, Thyme, Sparkling Wine - $14) and Exotic Boulvard (St Germain, Lychee, Sparkling Wine) which were both tasty and refreshing. Really like the Coq'tail list here! We enjoyed the 2015 Jean Paul Brun L'Ancien Beaujolais ($52) with our Thanksgiving dinner and find the wine list has many interesting, reasonably priced options. Service- On Thanksgiving, staff were doing the best they could to keep up with the volume, but were rather stretched and managing reservations was a bit chaotic.-  Our waiter was very pleasant and I'm sure excellent on normal nights.",0,0,1,D.

For appetizers we had a foie gras terrine en croute (baked into bread so yummy) and the meurette, poached egg in wine sauce. Apps were both very nice as was the bread. Sopping up the stock that formed the base of the meurette with the bread was a highlight. Overall a very nice French restaurant with a solid wine list, specializing in fowl.

4.0,11/21/2017,"No, it's not a restaurant with a theme around racketeering and RICO statutes: it's French! I welcome it, given the increasingly middling and unpredictable quality of long-time neighborhood staple L'Express. Le Coq Rico (LCR)'s premise is a bold one: take the most uninspiring of the major meats (chicken) and center the entire menu around it. I was skeptical, but I have to say, the stuff was amazing, even though they ran out of the original chicken I wanted to order. We split the duck egg and the Hampshire. I'm normally a glutton and eat and order too much, but this stuff was way too filling, and I woke up the next day feeling really stuffed. There is something they do to all the food here that gives it a ""comfort food"" feel. Dessert was profiterole chocolate.

5.0,11/19/2017,"At the onset of this establishment in 2016 I was fortunate to visit 3 separate occasions : first, their family and friends evening that showcased their menu and staff as somewhat of a practice/pre-opening dining experience. Second, same, but for Brunch, and third a farewell dinner with a friend that  assisted the business from France. I'm fairly certain I / we had the opportunity to sample the majority of the menu and I was nothing short of blown away by every offering. Let's see how well my memory serves, and keep in mind the menu may have changed. Someone had ordered the giblets and I was politely declining but they insisted and in no way was I expecting to find this plate delicious but please do yourself a favor and order this. There's a section on the menu for Eggs and you must have the one with the red wine , no matter it sounds strange to you, order it. There's this whole chicken in a pot, sooooooo homey and delicious perfect for the rainy night we dined. I was introduced to a candy along with my drink At the bar and not only did I find a new favorite sweet, but a delightful cocktail as well! For dessert, the big marshmallow puffball - very delicate but more filling than I realized. Share with someone.

1.0,11/12/2017,"One of the most disappointing dinners I've ever had!  I was looking forward to trying this place out, as an chef friend of mine had recommended the resto for their amazing chicken.  My experience was supremely different from service to food and I would encourage anyone who wants quality checking to head elsewhere.  Here's the many ways they failed at retaining me as a customer:- Messy Host Service:  booked an immediate reservation for dinner, seeing that they had open for reservations every 15 min around the time period around the time I booked, I did not anticipate a wait.  Not only was there over the 15 min wait after our reservation time (which is fine enough in itself), we were rudely dismissed by the female hostess while the male host was scurrying to sort tables out.  They clearly were not communicating as the guy asked if the girl gave us an update, meanwhile the girl never so much as stopped to check on despite making eye contact several times for her attn.  when the table was finally available, the guy gave us a choice between standard table or ""special chefs kitchen table"".  We opted for the chefs table and while waiting and to be sat, the female hostess came by to ask us the same exact question.  It was a mess from the very start and a sign of things too come.  I really wish we would have just left and went elsewhere from there.  As a side note, what they consider a ""chefs table is actually just sitting at a bar in front of the cooks rather than a proper chefs table in a kitchen.  We were underwhelmed to say the least.- Bad Wine Service: when asking the waiter if they had carafes for their wine listed by glass (as there is a price per glass and a more expensive price) he said yes they do.  I proceeded to order a carafe of the red wine and was surprised to be served only a glass.  When I asked what happened to the carafe he looked at me confused and addressed me as though I made the mistake and didn't know what I was asking for.  Adding to this, while I did have the opportunity to taste the first glass to ensure it tasted fine, when I changed to another wine, he did not offer that mandatory first Taste for anyone who knows anything about wine.  - DRY Chicken:  I'm seriously wondering if my chef friend got a different chicken on the menu, as our SEVENTY-TWO dollar Delaware chicken for two was  BONE DRY and TOUGH/undercooked looking in some areas.  It was downright unappetizing for 25 dollars let alone charging 70+!!  My dining mate and I were downright annoyed at what a waste the meal was.- Inattentive Wait Staff:  after getting through most of our dry chicken meal, it became a test to see if the wait staff or kitchen would be bringing us our order of fries to at least have something enjoyable with our main.  We made it through our whole meal without the fries.  Had to flag down the waiter to get our check after quite some wait to be checked in on, and were even charged for the fries that we never received!Unbelievable!  I dine out most nights out of the week and have to say this is without question one of the worst dining experiences I've had.Save yourself and go elsewhere!",2,0,0,Amy T.,"Seattle, WA",82,24,1

Despite having made a reservation several weeks in advance, we were seated in what can only be described as a hallway. Three tables placed along the wall in the long space between the rest of the tables and the bar/entrance. It makes one feel like an afterthought. After that, it took our server over 10 minutes to come by the table after we were seated. We wanted a drink! From there, they completely forgot to bring one of our dishes, failed to check on our meal in time to catch that they hadn't brought one of our dishes, and the men's bathroom had been used as a puke bucket for someone (not the fault of the restaurant, I know). The food was spectacular, but the service was lackluster and utterly disappointing.

The wines by the glass were horrid (we tried 4), and only once did the server give a taste before dumping the little carafes into our glasses.

The potatoes were also flavorless. The service was off as well--not organized whatsoever and the wrong dishes were given to us twice.

Chicken is rarely ever my preferred meat of choice, but Le Coq Rico has so swiftly and effortlessly convinced me to change my thoughts with one single meal. This restaurant focuses on whole-animal poultry preparation and their expertise truly shined throughout the meal. I can never look at chicken the same way again!My boyfriend and I came for the NYC Restaurant Week pre-fixe and we ordered:-Deviled eggs - two tangy deviled eggs served over a light, vinegary cabbage salad and topped with fresh radish sprouts. I was in love with this starter!-Chicken terrine - a lovely meat and pate dish that didn't have an overly strong flavor. The description and name of this dish doesn't mention anything about liver (which was a little confusing), but luckily I love liver.-Quarter chicken Brune Landaise - succulent roasted chicken aged 120 days served with a side of seasonal salad. I'll admit that I was anticipating a little more of a kick in my first bite, but as I continued to eat the dish, I could really tell that this quality meat was delicately prepared, seasoned, and roasted. Each bite was juicer than the last!-Ice cream (berries sorbet, mint, madagascar vanilla) - such a refreshing dessert. The stand-out flavor for me was mint, which tasted of fresh mint leaves but my boyfriend preferred the rich aromatic flavor of the vanilla bean.-I'ile flottante (meringue in creme anglaise) - what an end to a meal! This soft dome-shaped meringue was floating in a smooth and creamy red praline & creme anglaise. Definitely a star dessert that would have me coming back for more.From the gorgeous bird-themed decor  to the attentive waitstaff to the exquisite attention to detail of the dishes, this charming restaurant is easily one of my top memorable dining experiences in NYC.",2,1,1,Selena Y.,"Jersey City, NJ",116,452,1509
5.0,8/21/2017,"I went here for dinner solo the other night after waiting for an appropriate date night to go with my wife. She never got the idea of a high end chicken restaurant no matter my plea of culinary diversity. I sat at the chefs bar which overlooks the cooking and prep area. After ordering a nice white wine, I asked Claire for recommendations and she pointed a few items out. While her French accent was beautiful in theory I didn't understand much of what she had said. Not to be detoured I asked for a minute and quickly asked the chefs what I should have as a first timer. Curiously I didn't see a lot of communication between them and the patrons. I know they have to focus at the job at hand but to the point where I thought someone must have said something to them about talking because none of them talked to patrons. There should be some balance since it is a chefs bar, right?Anyway, I asked one of the chefs and he surprised me by saying all of them are really good but I should try the duck egg appetizer and chicken special for 1. Well I tried both and the appetizer is one of those dishes that make you want to come back again and again. The mushroom and foam make the plate taste like a dessert. When you break the duck yoke it actually tasted a bit sweet when paired with the mushrooms.Chicken dishes universally have gotten a bad rap in that when we ny'ers dine out it's the last think we typically order unless your dieting or hate everything else on the menu. Point is, chicken is usually never the main thing. Le Coq Rico makes chicken not only the main thing but they prepare it as if it's the only thing we should eat. Most of the menu is centered around birds that have brined or aged for 90 or more days. This is the Peter Lugers of Chicken!The main dish was expertly prepared. The display of the plate looked simple enough, but you get the feeling that this bird isn't the normal Perdue chicken you get at the grocery. The meat itself tasted as if it went through a delicate process, this isn't your grandmothers baked chicken. No this something that takes time to perfect where the seasoning, quality of bird and presentation make a unique display of culinary art which we should all try at least once. I had the brioche dessert. And for a French restaurant they did a solid job. You expect them to nail desserts but the choices weren't as many as I would have thought. But I didn't come for the desserts, I came for the french version of heaven in the form of a bird. For that they killed it and then some.Cheers!",2,0,1,Maurisse J.,"New York, NY",86,12,1

2.0,7/30/2017,"I'm a bit surprised by the positive reviews of Le Coq Rico although I should preface this review by saying I went in for a Restaurant Week lunch and I feel like the menu they offer for restaurant week is perhaps doing them a real disservice. My one line review would be that this is a VERY expensive fancy Boston Market, and not much better. For the details read on:Food: Pea & Mint: soup was ok, nice flavor but no real depth and so heavily pea flavored that nothing else came through. Chicken Terrine: I'm not a huge fan of terrines to begin with, but this was perhaps the worst I've tried. Too firm to eat, with little flavor and no real melding between the layers. I think you could buy something better out of a supermarket case.Mains.Plate du jour, which was a vegetable stew of sorts: This was bland and somewhat mushy one note dish. It was what the French I think would call at Provencal vegetable stew, or working man's stew. Its success was in its mediocrity. 1/4 Chicken: The chicken was nice, juicy and pleasant. But not a ton of flavor. As I said above, side by side I'm not sure I could distinguish it from a 1/4 chicken from Boston Market. Based on this dish I do feel like poultry is where the menu excels, but then your Restaurant Week menu should really emphasize this. The dish is small and extremely expensive for what turns out to be well prepared but very basic chicken. Dessert.3 Sorbet: Berry Sorbet was unpleasant, Lemon was too tart to eat and didn't have that clean fresh quality I look for in citrus sorbets. The Mint was actually nice. And the portion size was huge, so that was a nice surprise.Meringue/Cream dessert: Very tasty! And also large. This is essentially a vanilla custard with a ball of meringue that is more like marshmallow. But its pretty and tastes good and is well sized. If only some of the food matched in those characteristics. The wine we had with lunch was wonderful and at $8 extremely well priced so thats a plus.The service was very friendly, but disappeared once our meal started. For example, we didn't see a servers once during our meal to ask for second glass of wine, which we would have liked.The room and the entire place is in fact straight out of Paris which is nice. Is a very cosmopolitan feeling restaurant, but I'm not sure I'd call it comfortable.",0,0,0,Luke L.,"Brooklyn, NY",4,55,0

They are truly about customer service, not trying to have us just spend a ton on the bill. The appetizers are flavorful and the perfect portion size.

5.0,7/3/2017,"Wow. So I have to admit, I went to Le Coq Rico not really expecting much but I have to say dinner blew all of my expectations (or lack there of) out of the water. The food was solid. The most memorable dishes were the whole duck and the leeks. I think I will go back for the foies and the terrines! In general, I would have been very happy with the meal, but it would not have inspired me to write a review. DESSERT! DESSERT was unbelievable! For dessert lovers out there, you have to come here at least for the dessert. First: the I'ile Flottante - floating island. I've had floating islands before in France and had actually labeled them as one of the most revolting desserts I have ever had in my life. But the I'ile Flottante at Le Coq Rico was heavenly. The meringue was light and held its own distinct texture even when paired with the thick and fragrant custard.  I've been thinking about it for days now! Second, the vanilla mille-feuille was out of this world. Layers of perfectly crispy puff pastry separated by a smooth creme with the perfect amount of sweetness. I don't think I've ever had a mille-feuille as good as that one in the United States, and honestly, most of the bakeries in Paris will not even be able to compare to the quality of pastry and the level of execution that the mille-feuille at Le Coq Rico required. Service was also phenomenal. My mother ordered a total of 3 leeks at different points during our dinner and our captain (Max) was completely un-phased and made sure we received the leeks each time. Would recommend this place to anyone in a heart beat!",1,0,0,Michelle M.,"Manhattan, NY",0,1,0

Every single thing was better than we had hoped for, and while it isn't an inexpensive place to dine (our guinea fowl alone was $100), with a group of 6, it didn't seem overly expensive when all was said and done, and from the list above, we didn't hold back with our ordering! I definitely felt like the meal was memorable enough to justify the price. The service was also really friendly, and they went so far out of their way to make sure our experience was a good one.

5.0,7/1/2017,"I was more than a little surprised that I liked this place as much as I did.  The reviews sounded like I shouldn't expect much, and I'm not a big fan of French food. BUT... I'm a fan of good food, good servce, and good wine.  They're all there.  There were four of us. We started with the innards plate (WAY better than it sounds), the leeks vinaigrette, artichokes bargioule, and chicken terrine.  The innards are the way to go if you're feeling adventurous, and you won't be disapointed, the terrine if you're nervous.  I loved everything but the leeks, which Iiked:  to me , leeks vinaigrette should pucker.  Hollandaise sauce makes them a rich, substantial dish rather than the ""relish"" I prefer. But valid, and a beautiful presentation.We then had the house special, the ""Baeckoeffe,"" which is textbook Alsatian. You wait for it, but it's worth it.  They present it, take it away, cut it into serving pieces , and you then eat the best braised chicken you've had.  EVER.  Desserts:  we skipped the two foot napoleon (It IS two feet long), and had chocolate profiteroles, the berry parfait, and ille flotante.  Now,  NO ONE makes ille flotante anymore.  NO ONE.  It's considered a dessert for children:  be a child.  For a while.  Drink riesling:  ask Max.  He won't steer you wrong.  No one will. they are really, REALLY invested in making sure you have a good time and enjoy everything.  I think any criticism comes from folks who think ""oh, it's a chicken place, it'll be cheap.""  Well, good chicken is NOT cheap, and it does NOT taste like breast meat from Olive Garden.  So, DO bring a wallet (it is expensive), but then just sit back.  You'll have a great meal",0,0,0,Norman H.,"New York, NY",101,75,0

5.0,6/25/2017,"One of my favorite meals in the NYC. Server Shane provided top notch service through the meal. I'd return again in a heart beat. The chicken tastes unlike others I've ever had. Their chicken is special, as their birds age much longer the conventional US method of production. The meal throughout moved smoothly. 1) The Foie Gras Terrine , I usually order seated foie if it's on the menu but I've read theirs is renowned. So I did, and for the foie lovers, it is pure to the core. Delicious but also heavy, as foie is almost all fat = pure indulgence. 2) The Landaise chicken, which is their signature dish was delicious, moist, tender, crisp on the skin, and tasty as in the aging process of allowing the bird to develop. The restaurant claims their chickens age to around 4 years. For two hungry people, the half chicken may not be enough. I could have eaten the whole half by myself. 3) The sides, the salad was delicious also. For the vegetarians I'd say this is great! The French fries were crispy, and tastes great with the chicken. Not the best fries I've ever had. If I had one wish for the meal it'd be to improve the fries. 4) The trio of ice cream. Absolutely worth it and delicious ! The vanilla and chocolate were awesome !5) The wine list, vast and deep. Any wine-o would find their preferred region and bottle of choice. The 5 premier Bordeaux houses and also the DRC in their cellar as well. All in all a great meal. They're on my list for restaurants to return to in the city.

My wife's family go to Alsace every year and had long been fans of Le Buerehiesel as well as meeting the Westermann family, so we were really excited when the chef opened a NYC outpost of his famous French shrine to all things poultry. The egg appetizers are quite nice as are the fries and the puréed celeriac, but the real showstoppers are the baeckeoffe, an Alsatian whole chicken stew reduced to a golden goodness of chicken, artichokes, carrots, potatoes and Riesling, and the adventurous desserts. The baeckeoffe, made from the aged Brune Landaise chicken, is presented to the table in its splendid glory in Alsatian clay ware and then whisked away to be plated. Even though it's expensive for basically a stewed roast chicken, it's magical and so utterly unctuous that it will make you reconsider the possibilities of a 'great chicken dish'.

One might have expected that the delicious millefuille (big enough for 6) or one of the bottles of wine might be comped, or that we wouldn't be rushed out so politely and discretely, but alas, the restaurant was severely lacking in the level of hospitality one would expect for a $600 meal in a highly touted restaurant.

5.0,5/3/2017,"My wife has been wanting to check this spot out for a while, given her affinity for eating birds of any size - so when there were reservations handy on Sunday evening, we took the plunge and made our way over for dinner. It has what feels like a narrow entry, with a bar out front, but there is a small dining room in the back, followed by a lengthy bar seating in front of the kitchen. We got placed right in front of the large oven full of chickens roasting near the open flame - a very aromatic spot to be seated. The service was quite attentive, with our drink orders being taken relatively quickly, as well as having our main course served at a perfect interval. The cocktail list here is quite good; I had a couple of them, both of which were expertly made and showcased the fine craft of cocktail-making aside from the quality of the liquor. I especially enjoyed the mezcal-infused cocktail, which worked very well combined with grape juice in creating a smoky yet fruity drink.Food-wise - it is a French restaurant, so it wasn't surprising to be served (very) dense bread with creamy butter as a starter while we awaited the rest of our food. We decided to share the award-winning foie terrine to start, and it was fantastic. It's not uniformly creamy as other terrines, and it's shaped like a slice of brioche bread - with a brioche crust ringing the outer edge. Aside from being well-presented, it is also served with a jelly that actually tasted more like gelatinized broth (perhaps from the duck) that was slightly sweetened...if anything, it served to both accentuate the flavor of the foie, as well as add a hint of sweetness. For our main, we decided to go big and do a whole bird. We went with the guinea fowl, based on the description from our waiter, along with a side of the potato puree. I loved the potatoes - I'm a sucker for mashed potatoes generally, but these were so creamy and buttery (probably to an unhealthy level) but still on the lighter side. Pouring some of the chicken au jus over it was really nice as well, as the jus was on the lighter side and didn't make the potatoes any heavier. The chicken was served pre-cut and was quite delicious. The guinea fowl has dark meat, some meatier bites (the wings are quite muscular), along with the succulent breast meat cuts that you would expect. The crispy skin is delicious, and it's hard to say that you don't get your money's worth...it's definitely a step up from your average rotisserie chicken you can buy in the grocery store. Perhaps the highlight of dinner, though, was dessert. The black truffle ice cream is astounding...I have had white truffles before in desserts (and ice cream), and they are not as earthy as black truffles are. Here, in an ice cream that combined crumbled Oreo and truffle, and was entirely encased by freshly-shaven truffle, you have something that is absolutely delicious on all levels. The ice cream isn't overly sweet, but the Oreo helps to cut through what would otherwise be a dominating truffle presence and balances it out. One of the best desserts I have had recently, and a very unique one to boot.The decor here is simple and modern, and the menu doesn't try to complicate things much either - just a honed-in focus on providing chickens and French food that will please anyone. With fabulous drinks and desserts, you will enjoy the food here in all aspects. A worthy neighbor to Gramercy Tavern!",3,2,4,Asuka N.,"New York, NY",371,1653,169

4.0,4/10/2017,"Was never a huge fan of ordering chicken from nice restaurants until the last few years but with places like NoMad and Le Turtle, I ended up getting into the whole craze. While it was a good chicken, I felt it was overhyped, but the sides and overall experience still made it enjoyable. What we got:- Leeks Vinaigrette - sounds weird but was by far the best dish. Really unique and great way to start the meal. - Mac and Cheese - I'm not even a fan of it usually but this was great. Love the rigatoni and while creamy it wasn't overly heavy- New Hampshire - was drawn to this bc of the mix of white and dark meat. Have to say that without the jus, it would have been pretty ordinary and very dry. Not at all on the level of the higher end chicken dishes that have been flooding the scene lately. So overall, was good but nothing great. Would recommend Le Turtle over this.",0,0,0,Pearce D.,"Hoboken, NJ",185,182,555
3.0,4/6/2017,"Ok so the chicken is good. However, I don't know if it justifies the steep price tag for ""chicken"". I've literally had caviar and prime cut steaks for less. I am an avid foodie with no expense spared, if it's worth it. I felt that the chicken was fine, but not for 1/4 of a moderate size cluck for a quarter of $100 bucks. WTF. I did preview the menu beforehand, so i was aware or the pricey nature. I jumped into this adventure expecting to be blown away. It was decided if the chicken was beyond superb, then the $60 price tag for 1/4 bird, with greens, mushrooms and a small side of mac would be justified and worked into my palate as a new addiction. I honestly believe there are other chicken places with ""Provence like"" concepts that are more flavorful and reasonable prices.

4.0,3/19/2017,"While dining at this remarkably tantalizing spot that specializes in poultry, the people at the neighboring table thought they were at Popeye's. For their order of two quarter roasted chicken, they were served a half-chicken. The server and the manager tried to explain that a chicken has only two breasts and two hindquarters. She reminded them that well breed and carefully raised birds were used. It made no difference. They were intent on having a miserable evening because of their comfortability with Boston Market food. This place was miles away from fast foods. To start the Terrine En Crote of Duck Foie Gras was brilliant. If you like a terrine this is on to try, rich, dense and so flavorful. The pastry wrap was such a nice match. The combination remains on my mind still. For an entrée I had the Chicken Pot, a wonderful broth of rich chicken and vegetables that was roasted in the liquid. The meat was full of savory taste. My dining companion fully enjoyed the Roasted Squab, also packed with a beautiful pastry wrapping. Dessert was as flawless as the fowl. The L'ile Flottante was a sculpted tennis ball of meringue surrounded by Red Praline and sitting in a bath of Creme Anglaise. It was delicious beyond expectations.Go to Le Coq Rico.

4.0,3/18/2017,"We came here on a Saturday night and had a really wonderful date night. When our waiter asked us if this is was our first visit, and we said yes, he offered the following explanation: were like a steak house, but for chicken! This turned out to be quite true as almost every course on the menu has poultry in some form or other (eggs, duck, pigeon, etc.). Here's what we had:- I had the French Bellini cocktail, which was pretty and pretty great! My fave!- First up was the SEARED DUCK FOIE (Honey Crisp apple, cherry vinegar reduction & almonds) app. I think this was the real winner for me. Everything worked great together and every ingredient packed a good punch and served its purpose....the apple added crunch and sweetness, the almonds (although very few) added that nuttiness and added crunch to the softness of the folie.....My only complaint would be more color/searing on the foie would've been nice.- For the main course we each had the quarter chicken, which comes w/ a seasonal salad. - The chicken was lean, flavorful and very good. It was a lot and we took half home. I used it for Sunday dinner and it cooked up beautifully. I LOVED the dressing on the salad (very simple, lots of flavor). - Sides - we shared the thick cut fries. Pretty good, but we got quite a bit more of the over fried bits/pieces than ideal.- Dessert - we shared the grapefruit soufflé. It's a beautiful dessert and it was just as delicious. My only complaint would be that it was paired with a lemon sorbet that was super tart, inedible in my opinion, along w/ a grapefruit granita (also very tart)....If perhaps they would have paired w/ a vanilla gelato, this would have been a true winner in my book.

First bite, and you notice a depth unlike regular chicken (~40 days). This, had a deeper flavor, more mature, and definitely some healthy fat to go along with it (peep last pic to see unique color of fat. contains higher amounts of Omega 3's! so it's healthy too??!). The aged quality is very noticeable; finally chicken gets on steak's level. Not as bold and fatty, but still with its own aged 'character.'

4.0,3/14/2017,"Le Coq Rico is a great upscale restaurant in the flatiron/gramercy neighborhood that provides chic and modern environment and high quality food at excellent value. We have been to the restaurant twice, once for brunch and the other time for dinner.  Both meals were with another couple-friend and we shared the whole bird (for 4 with salad). Us and our guests enjoyed the experience very much. Food - the slowed cooked eggs for starters were excellent; the roasted plymouth barred rock chicken was tender, juicy, and flavorful paired with champagne vinaigrette simple and tasty salad with roasted whole garlic made a very satisfying and perfectly portioned meal to share. Atmosphere - brunch time was quiet, it could have been due to we came during July 4th weekend; dinner time was busy, great neighborhood feel, great bar (very bustling with nice selection at different price point). environment is elegant but casual at the same time; brightly lit, half open kitchen concept makes the atmosphere very warm and welcoming; mixed with cool/young and older couples. Service - staffs were welcoming, efficent, and responsive, but they were not over the top ""out to please you"" type, which fits well with the frenchy, hip and elegant factor of the restaurant. We are a fan, and look forward to go back, but will probably wait for another dinner outing with friends, as one whole bird is a little too much food for two.",0,0,0,J Z.,"Manhattan, NY",44,42,3
5.0,3/7/2017,"This restaurant was strongly reminiscent of that chicken skit from Season 1 of Portlandia. I think all of the chickens (or the eponymous ""beautiful birds"") had a great life and many friends before coming here to be eaten by me. You could tell how meticulously sourced everything here was (they have all the farms presented on the front of the menu).I'd been looking forward to coming here for awhile, and finally made the trip after scoring a weeknight reservation on OpenTable. It seems that although there isn't that much availability far out, people will cancel as the date gets closer and tables open up significantly.A few of us arrived earlier than others, so we ordered drinks at the bar while waiting. I got some vodka-scotch-cherry concoction, which was delicious (no maraschinos here).My table of 4 split everything:- En Meurette - oh my gosh, that sauce. We were fighting over the bread to soak up every last drop. The egg was perfectly cooked with an extra runny yolk, and bacons and mushrooms added to the richness of the dish.- Terrine en Croute of Duck Foie Gras - so very rich (are you noticing a theme here?), this was almost like a block of butter. Delicious, livery butter wrapped in some kind of pastry with a slice of gelatin on top. Way more appetizing than I'm making it sound.- Brune Landaise - we went with the rotisserie style chicken over the baked stew. After presenting the bird to us, they took it back to be sliced. This was, hands down, the best chicken I've had in recent memory, and I had the Nomad chicken less than two months ago. Exceptionally crispy skin yielded to perfectly cooked meat. Even the white meat was tender! This also came with a side salad, in case you wanted to feel healthy for whatever reason at a French restaurant.- Mushrooms: meh. Good mushrooms, but definitely overpriced for the portion size.- Fries: these are fries. They are hard to mess up, and they were fine.- I'Ile Flottante: signature dessert. I made my friends get this despite their protests because I just had to try it (thanks guys!). Luckily this is a pretty light dish - a perfect sphere of meringue floating in some sort of super liquid creme anglaise.

5.0,2/17/2017,"Incroyable! Super! Delicieux!French bistro that zeroes in on poultry related dishes and perfectly combines the richness of traditional French cuisine and elegant soul of French culture. Highly highly recommend it!I came here for Valentine's dinner booked from Opentable - it is usually popular and we only got 9:45PM spot but turned out to be enough time before it closes and not too crowded/noisy vibe. Though the entrance was very narrow, the space inside was very big and was structured into several narrow long corridors so you get a lot of privacy and don't really feel that you are sharing the space with a lot of people. I was lucky to be seated right next to the kitchen where they roast all the chicken and we could feel the heat, haha. The waiters were all very nice and seem to be all French (as they were talking in French to each other).Now let's talk about food.It isn't like the traditional french restaurant that you have to do 3 courses or prix fixe. There isn't a clear distinction between appetizer or main dish either. The only distinction is the dishes with chicken derivatives and the dishes that are with real big chunks of chicken. For the real chicken dish, since a lot of them come in a whole chicken, I'd say better come with multiple people so you can share a chicken - otherwise for 1~2 people, a ~$80 chicken would be too much.[Chicken derivative dishes]Offal platter - basically a platter of 4 kinds of small bites that come from all parts of chicken. Most directly, chicken croquette made of chicken. Standard. Chicken wing grilled with honey and ginger - delicious and has an Asian teriyaki spin. Chicken liver tapas - very rich taste. But the best is... chicken heart skewer - chicken heart is very chewy and it seems also to come with a little bit duck foie gras which significantly raised the taste. Really really lasting rich taste. Yummy!En meurette - OH MY GOD. The best dish of the night. It is basically a poached egg slow cooked in red wine sauce with mushroom and bacon. The egg turns slightly purple. The sauce is so so so so rich. It is so simple and common yet so so good. With the help of baguette, I made sure I finished every single drip of the sauce.Sunchoke salad with chicken gizzard - really refreshing and special. Two highlights: first, sunchoke. It tastes like artichoke but is more soothing and smooth (like potato) - different from artichoke, it is a root plant and has very subtle lasting fragrance; second, grilled chicken gizzard - very chewy and flavorful! Everything comes along really well together. [Chicken dishes]Quarter chicken with slow cooked sauce - simply rotisserie chicken but so so so good!! The meat was so tender and so flavorful with all kinds of spices. The ""gravy"" sauce was so rich and hot (temperature wise) that you feel like chicken is melting in your mouth. I also added some truffle, which made the entire thing heavenly. Truffle's smell dominated everything and always comes first before everything, which separates all layers of tastes - first truffle, then sauce and last roasted chicken. Such a culinary experience![Dessert]l'ile flottante (floating island) - the signature dessert here - basically a big ball of meringue (sweet egg white) coated with caramel sugar, floating in sweet creamy sauce. Meringue is almost tasteless so the sweet creamy sauce complements with it really well.In general, I had great dining experience here - high quality food with nice surprises, great service and nice decor.

Le Coq Rico is actually a great choice for this because it had many items on the menu that it normally served for lunch and dinner. Many restaurants will create dishes specifically for restaurant week, so you won't actually get an authentic taste of the restaurant, but at Le Coq Rico, one doesn't have to worry about this.The appetizer I got was the Deviled Eggz. They were actually very good. Quite creamy as well. These will disappear quickly.My main was the Quarter chicken (which has the 110-day old chicken). It comes with a somewhat uninspiring side salad, but the chicken itself is delicious. It was arguably the most tender chicken I have ever had, and it came with a wonderful sauce complimenting it. My dessert was the L'ile Flottante, which roughly translates to floating island in English? It was gorgeous. I honestly describe it as if one was eating a cloud. Fluffy and light, it was a great way to finish lunch. Service was attentive and helpful, decor was hip and modern, and I also got to sit on their kitchen counter.

We thought the variety of birds was the point. (We learned by eavesdropping on the table next to us what distinguishes each bird--and, oh, a special of the night.) Apparently our waiter was in too big a rush to get us out. Perhaps that explains why our appetizer needed to be whisked off the table to make room for the main course in our speed-eating frenzy.

And ""Plate de Jour"" though it was explained by our server it did not offer white or dark meat, my had plateful of chicken cooked with lots of neck tiny bones.I used to be a caterer knowing that majority eating culture here is not so crazy about chicken innards and bones, just like we usually won't look twice the markets $2 box chicken gizzards instead we select Chicken breasts as white meat.Personally I have no problem eating chicken innards and have bones in dark-meat chcken, it just Americans tend to spoil whatever comes from France.It was an okay chicken place, nothing to write home about it.Finally our complementary to the dessert!

3.0,1/23/2017,"Restaurant Week Winter 2017I have been wanting to check out this new French place in Flatiron and it was a bit of a let down.PROS:- Service was A+. The waiter and the manager kept walking around the restaurant asking if everything was alright and how were the dishes, and refilling our drinks as needed.- Decor was very modern. I thought the blue and white Fitch painting in the restaurant looked pretty cool and representative of their restaurant.THE OKAY:- Deviled ""Eggz"" (tuna Ventrèche & cabbage salad with cumin). Presentation of the dish was very beautiful but in terms of flavor there was nothing special about it. Tasted like a regular boiled egg to me and flecks of tuna and a bit of cabbage salad. 3.5 STARS- Butternut squash Soup (orange and ginger)  - Presentation was A+ as usual. Soup was good but nothing out of the ordinary. 3 STARS- Plat du Jour Quarter Chicken with a small seasonal green side salad - I have heard amazing things about this chicken from all the press and media but it fell short of my expectations. The chicken was aged 110 days (Brune Landaise) but I didn't really taste anything special or out of the ordinary from the chicken. They have a jus (sauce) that comes with the chicken and you definitely needed the jus for the white meat since the white meat was a little on the dry side. There was only one drumstick so that was the only piece of dark meat (best cut in my opinion) that wasn't dry. The salad was good because you definitely needed some veggies besides just eating meat. 3 STARS- L'lle Flottante (soft meringue & creme anglais) - this was the better dessert out of the two. It looks amazing as well. There was a sugar crust (similar to a creme brulee) on the top layer of this dessert and it was delish. Love the crunch and there was additional crunch from the thinly sliced pink almonds. There's also this big ball of fluff floating in the middle of the creme brulee. It was like eating marshmallows. 4 STARSCONS:- Baba au Rhum, chantilly cream - This was basically rum cake and cream. I didn't like the rum cake. The rum was too strong for me especially the part where the cake soaked up all the rum. 1 STAROverall: I wouldn't come back here.

3.0,12/19/2016,"3.5 stars overall. Service - 4 (overall very pleasant and attentive, but didn't refill water consistently which is a pet peeve of mine). Food - 3/3.5.I came here with 4 of my girl friends and though we had a very nice time because we were together, I have to say I was overall disappointed with the food. We ordered a bottle of wine, 2 appetizers, 2 mains, one side and a dessert (with after dinner drinks) to share:Slow cooked egg. This was very fluffy and quite tasty, though difficult to share because it's just one egg and once you split it open it's obviously messy.  Came with chanterelles, fava beans & peas fricassée with sherry vinegar chicken jus.Risotto with Truffle. This was a special and it was very cheesy and cooked to a nice al dente. It came with a decent amount of black truffle.New Hampshire chicken. I just don't get the hype. It's chicken, yes it's moist but it's probably the most boring thing I would ever order and at least at other restaurants they'll give you some foie gras to go with it.  Maybe if there were other dipping sauces to change it up, it would be more interesting. The salad that comes with the birds is very tasty.Rohan Farm Duck. Was well cooked, though since it's the whole duck, it was inconsistent. The skin was rendered very well though. Not the best duck I've had, but better than the chicken here.Fries. Very well seasoned, may have been my favorite thing we ordered, which shouldn't be the case.Dessert- Ile Flottante. Soft meringue, red praline & creme anglaise. It's very rich and flavored like creme brûlée. Was pretty impressive.It ended up being $100 each (5 people total), which is pretty pricey considering the substance of what we actually ordered (the wine was pretty cheap, so food seems overpriced).  Likely won't be coming back.",3,0,0,Elyka A.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",198,204,634

Was so disappointed with the service I only tipped 10%, which was vey generous considering.  The waiter then came and got our signed checks before we even left the table, looked at our tip amounts and then asked me what was wrong!

The service was of course, high quality. The food was adequately French and rich. The selection was limited--hey, I get it: do something well, and you don't need some dictionary full of menu items. It was mostly hens and other fowl on offer. As with much French food, I left feeling weighted down by the meal, however. This would be the kind of place I'd want to go for Thanksgiving if I didn't want to cook. The salads were nice, but the one I ordered mentioned gizzards last, and yet, it seemed to be the main feature of the salad, which was a turn-off. Can't we all agree that the most dominant ingredients should be listed in order? My husband's salad was a lovely little assemblage of lettuces in a glistening pool of dressing reminiscent of hollandaise.  The baked Alaska was petite, and we were grateful for that.

5.0,11/19/2016,"Probably Le Coq was one of those few places, that dessert could simply make up my whole meal - impeccable!

The chocolate sauce, on the other hand, played a very successful supporting role, and just at the perfect level of sweetness. This dessert deserves a million star, stand alone.Main courses certainly did not let us down. That En Meurette (egg slow cooked in the red wine sauce) was quite special and to me, a unique way to thoroughly combine egg with red wine. I also enjoyed my sausage. In fact, they have minced their mushroom so well, that I could only sense the flavor without catching even a single bite of it. I left Le Coq with nothing but a complete complacency.

2.0,11/8/2016,"Not my favorite dining experience. This place seemed like a really great establishment and is on all these food blogs and dining lists, but I do not know why? I came here for brunch on a Sunday and at first really loved the atmosphere, that is until I realized the service was not up to par. There were only larger parties so my table for 3 seemed like it would be easy to handle.. I was wrong. Asking for a cappuccino that never came (3 times) until finally a busboy put the order in. I can let that one slide, but when I open my napkin with silverware they gave me two knives instead of one knife and fork and took forever to bring me a fork. Moving onto the food, I ordered the mushroom chicken sausage and it was just okay (should've ordered the chicken) it was super bland and honestly wasn't that good. My friend got the poultry burger which they said was great! And my sister got the chocolate waffles which we both thought were nothing special at all.. not even the chocolate was sweet. Bummer.

First time I came for dinner and I was pretty amazed by the quality of food and service and was looking forward to try their brunch. Today I have to say that i left this place pretty disappointed. I arrived with my friend at 3pm and as soon as we got in they informed us that the brunch had just finished (on yelp it says that brunch is until 4pm), but they would ask the chef if they would be able to accommodate us. The hostess comes back and says that they would be able to offer us only the rotisserie chicken. As soon as we sat, the waiter came and my friend ordered an americano, right after the waiter brought the americano, he came back with the rotisserie chicken for two - not only they assumed that both of us were having the chicken, when I said that I only I was eating the chicken the waiter told me that he already prepared it for two and that was it, so he goes ahead and serves the chicken to me and comes back to bring only one salad, although he brought and charged the chicken for two. Having been there before Im pretty sure that each person gets his own salad, but today apparently they decided that one salad was enough. To make matters worse the chicken was not even warm and tasted just OK, nothing compared to what I have had when I came for dinner. The reason Im giving this place two stars, is because i felt that the service was very inconsiderate, not asking us if we were both eating or if we needed anything else, its actually the first time I visited a restaurant were apparently they assume their guests order. In the end I ordered a double espresso and was never even asked if I wanted desert or anything else. Of course they charged what they assumed, rotisserie chicken for two.

1.0,10/30/2016,"Meh. After reading Pete Wells review and another article in GQ we finally went for brunch on a Sunday. Restaurant was empty at 11:45AM and we were given the crappiest table in the whole restaurant right next to a major pillar. The tables are so close together that you have to pull out the whole chair and move the entire table if the person on the bench wants to get out. Maybe consider putting one table less into your dining room so it's not cramped like a chicken cage. Service was very mediocre. Ordered a coffee with soy milk. Waitress responds ""We only have regular milk."" Uhm... it's NYC.. Every other person doesn't drink dairy or is lactose intolerant. And you don't have soy (or any other milk). Fine. So no coffee for brunch. Waitress left.It took nearly 15 mins for her to come back with a harsh ""Do you want to order?"". Sure.. so we went ahead and ordered the deviled eggs, the brioche toast with cream, 1/4 chicken, Omelette with Cow cheese, fries and the pork platter. Don't judge me. It's Sunday and we were starving. Overall, food was very bland and overly greasy:- Deviled Eggs: Actually pretty good. The side of tuna was a bit odd but overall good.- Brioche Toast: Very tasty.- Omelette with Cow Cheese: VERY bland. My partner had two bites and stopped eating because it was so boring and bland.- 1/4 Chicken: This one had me really thinking. This is a chicken restaurant. Heck apparently they have THE BEST chicken in the world. Imported from France. Well... My chicken was greasy and dry. If you are charging $25 for half a chicken breast and a drumstick it better be amazing. It should blow my mind. But hey, it didn't. I was actually really disappointed. - Fries: Nothing spectacular. It's fries. Had to ask for ketchup and got the equivalent of one tiny Heinz ketchup package on a small plate. Ketchup must be rare these days.- Pork Platter: Pretty tasty. I actually said to my partner that it's funny that the pork dish is better than the chicken dish .. at the chicken restaurant. By the time we were done we didn't even finish half of our food. Service took the plates without even asking if anything was wrong. The are thousands of amazing brunch places in NYC. Le Coq Rico is definitely not one of them.

2.0,10/24/2016,"If pomposity is your persona and you are a fan of the children's fable ""The Emperor's New Clothes"", This is your kind of establishment.The appetizers are certainly creative. We had an assortment. All were over salted.The Mac and Cheese was creamy and over salted. The salad was all too simple and the dressing tasteless.And here's the fairy tale debunked...The chicken...what a joke. It was presented with all the pomp and ceremony the wait staff could muster. The truth is roasting a lovely organic chicken is as simple as going to a local farmers market or a good local market and buying a farm raised organic, free range chicken. Preheat the oven to a higher temperature and roast for 15 minutes. Reduce the temperature and roast until an instant read thermometer indicates the chicken has reached just under the completed temperature. Let the bird rest for ten minutes to preserve the internal juices for a moist and tender bird. You can get extra fancy and sous vide, but that's another cookbook.So what makes me such an expert? I am from Vermont. We buy local and have excellent poultry every week. We can buy an organic free range chicken for no more than $2-3 a pound. Our free range eggs are the ones with orange-yellow yokes and go for $3-4 a dozen. The rich color comes from the corn feed, just so you know. Just as an additional point of information, egg shell color means nothing to the taste of the egg. Both a farm raised chicken and eggs are worth the additional cost.The deserts were very good, but not extraordinary. The sorbet was OK, but not presented with any fruit.Moral of the story, go to a farmers market, roast a farm fresh chicken and save yourself hundreds of dollars.

Those dum dums who say here that they had better chicken at their local supermarket? They're NUTS.The chicken is locally sourced, and listening to our server describe the differences between the chickens that they offer does sound a bit pretentious...but when you taste the chicken, you'll forget all that. It's the best I've had (and I am including Barbuto.) And although the menu says that a whole chicken is enough for ""up to three"" it's really enough for four or five. We ordered four appetizers...three of their egg dishes (my favorite was the crispy egg, which came with arugula, asparagus, finely diced tomato, toasted hazelnuts and a delicious orange dressing.) The slow-cooked egg was almost like a soup, with al dente peas, fava beans, chanterelles and bacon...wow.  The deviled eggs were my least favorite but still some of the best deviled eggs I've had. Duck foie and offal platter were enjoyable, but neither compared to the egg dishes. Oh, and the bread (made in house) is the best restaurant bread EVER.All those appetizers are great but the terrine en croute is a MUST. Award winning and rightly so. The chicken was SO GOOD, seriously, I don't know how I will eat chicken anywhere else. It came with a simple green salad that was exactly what a simple green salad should be...fresh and dressed perfectly. Mashed potatoes were spectacular, fries were yummy.ORDER THE MOREL SAUCE.

COQ RICO...THE BEST IDEA...EVER!!!  I contacted my friend Julien who works there. We walked in and we were greeted by the  manager Sarah who remembered me and every detail of our prior visit approximately six weeks ago. She knew where we sat, what my son looked like and who his girlfriend was...truly impressive for someone in the hospitality business in such a hustle bustle industry. Minutes later the General Manager, Anthony, seated us and made sure we had extra side dishes...a portion of potato mousseline and some sauteed mushrooms made their way to our table... A very generous unnecessary gesture by Monsieur Anthony  but much appreciated!! The perfectly dressed mixed greens salad in itself would have been the perfect accompaniment to an oversized crispy and moist chicken. Our server Elena was sweet, fresh, personable and fun. She made it a point to make sure that we were treated more than well. We eagerly watched the chicken ""brown"" at the rotisserie bar and we admired the chefs and sous chefs work their magic. Lastly my husband decided that a dessert was a MUST as he remembered the incredible vanilla mille feuilles...The pistachio strawberry was on the menu so that is what we had. I personally would have opted for the profiteroles au chocolat which always make my mouth water...but that's just me...

The Deviled eggs are so appetizing. Although the mushroom fricassee is a bit salty. The I'ILE FLOTTANTE dessert is so delectable. But I give 5 star to the staff. They are very attentive and helpful. They did not charge us for the mushroom fricassee when we mentioned that it was salty. That's very nice of them. We sat by the kitchen bar and I like it. I can watch them prepare the food.

2.0,8/22/2016,"I waited a day so I could calm down before I wrote this. The boyfriend and I went here for Sunday brunch. Now I get that this place is known for its chicken, but neither of us wanted to get chicken, so we ordered the bread basket, the waffles and the crisp and crusty egg. The bread felt stale, the waffles were chewy and not crisp, but what takes the cake is the service. The crisp and crusty egg is a fried, poached egg on top of a bed of seasonal greens and asparagus. Dish looked awesome, tasted good, until... I found a long strand of brown hair - nobody likes eating food with a hair in it, so I call my waitress and point out the problem. She takes the plate away from me, not uttering a single word. Okay. Maybe she took it to her manager. Then her manager comes to our table, the plate in hand and asks me, literally, 'she gave this to me - what do you want me to do with it?'.  Ummm, you're in the restaurant business, you tell me. But I remain calm 'there's a hair in my dish - I don't want to eat it'. She tells me their kitchen policy is to not let their staff have long hair, then looks at my hair pointedly. I tell her 'it can't be mine, my hair is jet black, this one is brown, and it is coming out from under the bed of greens'. Still no apology. 'What do you want me to do?'  I said I didn't want anything in return. I can pay the $10 the dish costs, there's no reason to plan an elaborate scheme to get out of paying for a stupid egg and some arugula. I work in the healthcare service business and even I know the customer is right, especially in situations as ridiculous as these. Only coming back when I look rich enough for this snooty, pretentious place.

A friend chef insisted we try and I checked it out online, was impressed that the NY Times gave it two stars right out of the gate. I can go into excellent cocktails, very nice appetizers, a fabulous dessert for two that served four, but it's about the poultry. Worth researching, it's an experience previously reserved for those most fortunate to travel rural France and luck into such dedication and knowledge, as well as a highly skilled and notable chef. We four shared the Plymouth Rock chicken and a couple of sides. The mushrooms were special. More than enough food for our party, and a recommended Trimbach Alsace Pinot Reserve that I will be drinking again soon. Service was special and unique, with the gentleman who helped orchestrate our dinner passionately and extensively explaining the restaurant's mission. We four look forward to working through the varied breeds of chicken as well as having a go at the duck. Clearly, the only way such poultry can be accessed is by having private farms raise according to old world standards.

3.0,7/20/2016,"Sometimes a restaurant does nearly everything right, and you still don't like it and don't go back. This is not that kind of place.At Le Coq Rico, they did a lot wrong, yet I still like the place and will probably return. Why? Because the food was very good indeed. From the duck rillettes to the whole Plymouth chicken to the duck breast, and even the perfectly dressed, acidic seasonal salad - these were flavors you don't taste everyday. The kitchen can cook and the product is excellent.Unfortunately, the standard of service felt very ""Cipriani"" like. Rough, clumsy and not on par with what feels like should be a modern, high-end bistro. I'll detail the rough spots below in the context of constructive criticism:We walk in and the maitre d' was pushy and rude. We sit and the terrible acoustics make the room deafening. We order and they forget a soup spoon as the soup sits in front of us for what feels like an age.After dinner, we order an amaro which arrives shaken, chilled and watery. We order coffee, it never arrives. We want the check, and the server disappears and we sit for at least 10 minutes trying to wave someone down.So, as you can tell, it wasn't a top dining experience. But...again, the food was great, and if you want to understand what people mean when they talk about how ""chicken doesn't taste like anything these days"", you should go. For me, the birds they're serving are worth the price, much like an aged porterhouse would be at a steakhouse.

3.0,7/9/2016,"My boyfriend has been wanting to try this game focused restaurant since it opened up in our neighborhood. We finally made a reservation at the kitchen bar (which I called to confirm was fully backed seats while watching the chefs cook) to get the full experience. Upon arrival we were led to the ""kitchen bar"" which was packed with people watching the chefs cooking although we were led past it to 2 seats facing 20th street. Ordinarily  I am a big fan of people watching but I was told we would be watching chefs. When I politely asked why we weren't at the ""kitchen bar where we could see the chefs"" I was told, ""you are"" by the hostess. My new York sass then kicked in and I also politely and now sarcastically asked (while pointing to the street the seats were facing, ""so your telling me that is a kitchen"". She then understood that we wanted to actually sit at the kitchen bar so we decided to wait at the bar bar with a cocktail for the experience we were promised. I ordered my usual dirty martini and was a little worried when I did not see the bartender put olive juice in the mixer. When I asked (to make sure I wouldn't have to send the drink back) he said ""we don't put olive juice in the mixer because It makes the next drink we make taste like olives"" He basically just told me that he doesn't wash the mixer between drinks, which is a bit off-putting considering I just shelled out $20 for an ""ok"" martini. My boyfriend loved his egg white whiskey drink which I decided I too would drink for the remainder of the meal. After about 20 minutes the hostess came over to say the seats would be ready soon, but then her boss clearly messed up by stating to us he is so sorry for her error in seating another couple that just walked in in front of us which she did not say. Annoyance building.... When we were finally seated we handed glasses of white wine (which neither of us drink) as an apology. In my opinion a better apology would be to find out what we were drinking and then bring over a round on them...but that's just me. The food itself was solid. We both had the develed eggs which were delicious, my boyfriend had the duck while I had the Roasted Brune Landaise Chicken. Both dishes were very good.

It was a refreshing palette cleanser. To top it off Chef Westermann was in the restaurant greeting people. It felt similar to French celebrity chefs that used to come greet patrons at their tables but in a casualrelaxed way. For those that claimed $98 was expensive for chicken, the whole bird easily feeds 4 people.

Service is rather slow, especially for a Tuesday night, and we have wait a long while to get our food. On top of that, there is a missed order and a completely wrong dish. Normally, I would have kicked a fuss but the consommé is a saving grace. I also like that the execution is on point and much attention is paid into the details, such as the micro-sized cubes of the vegetable burnoise. This is worth a try, especially for poultry lovers.

4.0,6/22/2016,"KenScale: 8.5/10At the moment, New York is having a bonanza with large format chicken dishes. How good can a chicken be? I still consider the NoMad as a standard bearer of awesome chicken, and many other restaurants that have tried to replicate this formula have had success with varying degrees. Enter Antoine Westermann, a French chef who has a three Michelin star restaurant in Strasbourg famous for having awesome poultry selections. The moment I walked into Le Coq Rico, the first venture from chef Westermann, I could tell that the restaurant was displaying a ton of confidence in the authenticity of French poultry cuisine, with a French maître d greeting my dining group and most if not all of the staffs seemingly all French. The restaurant bills itself as the bistro of beautiful birds, and if you see the menu, each large format poultry dish shows the number of days the bird has been raised before it is brought to the dining table. In some ways, such bravado can be seen as arrogance, but in this case I have to give credit to Le Coq Rico because I've had one of the best chicken dishes in recent years.Before you dig into one of the large format poultry dishes, make sure you get a couple of appetizers because I had a lot to like about the ones that I tried. Among the egg selections, the one ""en meurette"" (with bacon and mushroom in red wine reduction) had very elegant flavor without being overly heavy. It was quite a nice start to the meal. My dining companion, who is not in general a fan of foie gras, didn't like the terrine en croute (i.e. in pastry crust) of duck foie gras, but I thought it was one of the better foie gras dishes in the city, with nice balance of flavor and texture. Now on the to main part. There are a number of options on the menu, but the fact that the restaurant left a separate section for ""Westermann's Baeckeoffe"" (I didn't know previously, but baeckeoffe is a classic chicken dish from Alsace region) apart from other dishes tempted me greatly to try this dish despite the hefty price tag (at $120). Let me say this was an absolute show stopper. First you see a bird inside a giant pot with smoke coming out of it (it was a shame I couldn't get a good photo of this decadent scene due to the smoke). Next comes the bird in a plate accompanied by artichokes, potatoes, tomatoes and Riesling jus. Not only was the bird perfectly cooked with juicy, tender meat, but I was just swooning over with the rich flavor of all the combined ingredients that worked so beautifully like a well-orchestrated symphony in my mouth. If you ever think a chicken dish is boring, think again. Even if the baeckeoffe didn't have anything fancy like truffle or foie gras, the elegance of this dish behind deceptive simplicity was a revelation. Add macaroni au gratin on the side, and I was one very happy (albeit extremely full) man. While the dish was suggested for up to four people, my dining companion and I, both already starving after intensive gym workouts, almost finished that entire thing! For dessert, l'lle flottante (the ""floating island"") of soft meringue, red praline and crème anglaise is the way to go, with the silky smooth sensation of the dish that was delightful (after all the chewing of the chicken, I needed something on the softer side).Getting a reservation at Le Coq Rico seems on the harder side, so I suggest booking in advance if possible. The dining space has a modern bistro feel to it, a trendy yet warm vibe without much pretentiousness. There is a full bar at the restaurant with French-centric wine selections. Get a bottle to wash down all the glorious poultry dishes you sample here. I wasn't sure whether I would like Le Coq Rico given their focus (how good can you be just with chickens?); at the end of the day, I'm so glad chef Westermann decided to cross the Atlantic and open this winner in Flatiron.",1,0,0,Ken S.,"Manhattan, NY",512,612,4738

We knew it would be too much food but we took the remaining chicken home to finish the next day (it was nearly as good leftover). While it was very good, tender and flavorful, we couldn't say it was the best chicken we'd ever eaten. The potatoes were perfect. I had a glass of a very good Oregon Pinot Noir. The Ile Flottante (meringue in a pool of creme anglaise) was superb, it melted in our mouth, though the serving was so generous that we had to leave half. It's a good dessert to share with a group.

Here in NY, they also sourced from farmers in the region. I think we had the Brune Landaise chicken aged 110 days, the skin was a bit yellow with the most amazing flavor and the meat was so tender. The jus was also really good, as my hubby said it's real jus not some kind of gravy. The jus was full of umami flavor! The salad dressing was balanced and so were the other dishes.

I had a small meal --- the artichoke salad was subtle and delicate and enriched with crispy bits of chicken giblets, fresh herbs and thinly sliced yellow beets.

3.0,5/24/2016,"0 stars for service, designed and executed poorly from start to finish:Dropped by for a Tuesday solo lunch at the kitchen, which is at the doors you'd think the entrance is at, but it isn't, and it's separated from the real one by unrelated doors. The kitchen stools are at an awkward distance from the counter, and the footrests are also awkwardly placed, making 2 separate parties after me depart due to both that and the inconsistent heat emanating from the burners.    Busboys were great, but the hostess was not particularly welcoming, and my server was extremely inconsistent and rushed (despite help and a pretty empty restaurant), asking how things were when I was clearly chewing, at one point proclaiming ""you're picking out every last morsel in there"", disappearing for long stretches, and more. Granted, he should not have been necessary because the experience would have been vastly improved in multiple ways had the cooks (one of which was blowing his nose loudly near the pass) just served my dishes from a few inches away. Instead, I spent unnecessary minutes watching my food sit on the pass (and then waiting both for the check and for it to get picked up, even though I had my card out when presented the bill). They also make their own jobs harder with structurally un-sound paper menus and bill holders, which the staff was visibly frustrated by, and I concerned would cause them to drop my card.3 stars for food:Glad I had a BlackBoardEats code making the weekday prix fixe lunch $27 with a free beverage (normally-$38 + cost of drink). Great bread with butter to start, and a second helping (that unfortunately came with no butter replenishment)***Sautéed chicken livers with hummus and mâche***Chicken quarter (better-than-most, with a great but very hot sauce so either dip or wait/watch your hands) with salad (which was standard in flavor, and comes with massive greens & a spoon)--110-day brown Landaise***L'île Flottante--soft meringue and crème anglaise - my favorite part of the meal, and it lingering almost overpowered the bad taste that the massive wait to pay and leave left***One glass of wine per person (ginger ale instead)PS on their OpenTable reservation, they don't ask for a card for certain-sized parties, yet state 'A $50 per person cancellation fee will be imposed for no shows or less than 48 hours prior notice.'",5,1,0,George C.,"New York, NY",0,7747,14304

We shared the Plymouth chicken, fries, and the Macaroni Au Gratin with a bottle of white wine.  Everything was divine.  The sauce. OMFG.

4.0,5/21/2016,"Gotta love those impromptu late Sunday dinners. Came here straight from LaGuardia after a weekend of being out-of-town. Seeing that there were reservations available, we snagged one immediately, on the cab ride back to Manhattan.Had heard a lot of great things about Le Coq Rico, and was intrigued by their poultry-centric menu. Not quite at all familiar with Chef Westermann's restaurants, but was eager to try. The vibe and decor of the space definitely screams fine dining, but it didn't feel stuffy, which I really liked. There seemed to be a lot of low-key, casual dinners going on in the dining room, and it was just a comfortable scene.What we got:- Phantom of the Sazerac (for 2): Maple smoked in a clamp-lid bottle, the cocktail was very strong and smokey, and we really liked the star anise flavor as well.- Offal platter: Livers, wings, other non-traditional parts. Delicious and well-seasoned, although not the most pleasant-sounding.- Crispy & Crunchy egg: Came with blanched cold asparagus which actually paired reasonably well with the runny, fried, crunchy, crusted egg.- Seared foie gras: Crusted in poppyseeds, the flavor and texture was perfect, and had that richness you get from foie gras.- Roasted squab: Wrapped in braised cabbage, the meat was very tender, although I didn't quite get any squab flavor.-Île flottante (Floating Island): Legitimately amazing. The perfect sphere of meringue was light and airy, and the pool of creme anglaise was velvety and not too sweet. Have yet to see any dessert quite like it.I was actually pretty impressed with the price points, considering most appetizers were less than $20, entrees were about $25-27, and the portions were quite sizable. Quite a good value all around, and we were stuffed afterwards, despite only ordering one entree. Our server was very personable and attentive, and gave us some really good recommendations, including that dessert.Will be back for that the ile flottante, and likely to try their other aged poultry.",53,32,46,Eric J.,"New York, NY",490,923,1792

2.0,5/16/2016,"Here's the deal. I've been to michelin-rated restaurants, top-of-the-top tasting menus, eaten abroad and at ""holes in the wall"" all over. I have a culinary background and have studied abroad in France and Spain. I have (I'd say) a well-rounded perspective of what is good, what is worth it and what characteristics determine a logical, fair judgement of a restaurant and it's food. I had high expectations, having read about Le Coq Rico opening in New York a few months ago, i've had it on my list for a while now. I was expecting, quality, well-developed flavors with an almost nostalgic depth of flavor --the best kind of simplicity. No fuss, just well cooked, good quality food without the frills. We went on a Sunday night, the host was nice enough, though he let us know that the table he could seat us at would be have to be given in 1.5 hours. We were okay with that. The waitress was okay, though she wasn't very attentive and a little on the pushy side. We started with the duck rillete. It was flavorful, well seasoned (one of the few things that didn't need salt). The pickles it came with tasted like supermarket cornichones and the like. meh. For the main meal we ordered a whole chicken to share, a side of ""thick-cut"" french fries and the rice. First the chicken. Sure, it was well cooked, it was decent, but for $100 I wanted a mind-blowing roasted chicken with rich flavor and crispy skin. Nothing with foam or fancy terminology, just something better than what I can get everywhere else. I don't mind paying, when it's worth it. To me, a decent chicken with nothing special, no crispy skin (we had specially ordered the chicken that our waitress said would have crispier skin) and lacking salt--not worth it. I didn't taste herbs, butter or even the very same chickens' flavorings at all. Probably partly for lack of a good finishing salt, but still. Meh does not equal $100. I could go to a peruvian rotisserie chicken joint in harlem and get something better. The fries too needed salt, were very bland and on par with just about every french fry at any establishment in the city. The name would suggest something rustic and homey. But ""basic"" sums it up. We were not fans of the rice, that resembled more of a soupy risotto. It's flavor was good, one of the only things that didn't need salt, and I could see why people would enjoy it. Not my taste,wasn't really into the creaminess. Like other's have mentioned, the dessert was where it's at. We ordered the L'lle Flottante ( a nostalgic dessert for my family) which was delicious and unexpected. The soft, airy meringue is lightly crusted with raw crunchy sugar that gives it a perfect touch of texture. It floats on a pool of creme anglaise with visible bits of vanilla bean. A spoonful gives you a momentary airy meringue that dissolves almost instantly in your mouth, a bit of crunch from the sugar and nutty roasted almonds every once in a while, and finally a creamy, smooth finish from the sauce. Very good, and if I come back, would be the reason why. I really, truly wanted to like this place. I had been telling my sister (who is a chef) that I would take her as soon as she visited, now I am not so sure. Maybe it is too new to judge so quickly. But I expected more overall. I also didn't appreciate that our dessert was swept out from under us 5 minutes before we were supposed to ""give up the table"", a kind reminder would have been more tasteful.",7,0,0,Michelle B.,"New York, NY",6,31,3

The first stop on the Billy Salts Saturday fun day is drinks and brunch at Le Coq Rico.My dad back in the day owned a supermarket in The Hamptons. He had a chicken rotisserie where locals can purchase freshly cooked chicken before heading out to the beach. Well, cooked chickens in a rotisserie make an incredible amount of grease. The deep tray needed to be emptied daily, it was the consistency of cooking oil. Guess who emptied the drawer? Yours truly so when i see a chicken rotisserie, I can appreciate whats involved. What had me intrigued about Le Coq Rico was their French method to chicken. What Le Coq Rico does is use free range birds and let them age longer than a typical chicken. The end result is a chicken with flesh that has more depth than what you'd get at Boston Market.My wife and I are seated in a elegant dining room.

2.0,5/12/2016,"I really wanted to like this place. It would have been an aces stop for food-anxious and picky relatives and friends.I took my mother here for Mother's day. My mother is usually pretty game for the more outre type places I've taken her before, as long as they have a safe choice, usually chicken or salmon. She marvels to this day about the time I got her to eat a piece of octopus at Il Buco. So, when it's time to take her out for Mother's day, I figured, chicken restaurant, right? Fancy chicken! All chicken! Can't go wrong! Right?Wrong.Reservation was for the most primest of times, 8 PM. Essentially when you'd expect the kitchen to be running at optimum. Well, upon arrival, we were informed by the maitre d that they were OUT OF CHICKEN. NO whole chicken, no quarter chicken. They had a few game birds (why is the Cornish hen the same cost as a chicken, by the way?), and they had the large format $150 stew. The combined dishes were still available. But no whole chicken, LITERALLY the restaurant's raison d'etre. At prime time. On a holiday. How a restaurant running for a few months with a seasoned management team could possibly not think that a holiday famous for dinner out might require extra birds is beyond me. And it was 8 pm, on Mother's Day. We weren't going to be able to walk down the block and get a table immediately at Gramercy Tavern, y'know? We were stuck.The service was affable, but a bit rushed...the place was not running at capacity (perhaps everyone eats early on Mother's day? Or perhaps there were a number of tables that just said NO when told that the famous chicken restaurant has no chicken), and we were seated at a lovely corner table, but then wait staff essentially hovered over us to grab any plate that was finished, the second it was finished.How was the food we actually got? Serviceable. Which for the cost and the pageantry, left me rather cold. I really wish I could give it a dispassionate review, but I was so peeved about the lack of chicken at a chicken restaurant that everything seemed to be seasoned with a patina of disappointment. But here's the rundown:Soft-boiled egg - it's a soft boiled egg. A single one. With salmon eggs and toast soldiers. For $14.Terrine en croute - It's a terrine. Very large amount of foie. Tasty.Lobster and Chicken - the sauce was actually quite delicious. It is a smallish serving, and there is very little lobster. It's $34. There should be a lobster tail in here. A whole one. There is not.Poule au pot - The half breast and full thigh in this was delicious. It only made me madder that this was not the chicken as advertised. Routine potato, carrot. There is a meatball of chicken and liver stuffed in a cabbage, and it was the only delightful surprise of the meal. Soup was VERY well seasoned. Get this when they are chicken-less.Pommes Puree - Excellent mashed potatoes. They were available. Perhaps they should refocus the restaurant on their potatoes.Vanilla Strawberry Vacherin - Good. All of the above, plus two cocktails, 1 bottle of (very modestly priced) wine, and two dessert wines came to $280 plus tip. I wish I could come back and try their chicken to see if it justifies the price tag. I will not come back and gamble another $300.",5,1,2,Brady B.,"Flushing, Queens, NY",18,62,48
5.0,5/10/2016,"And so we found ourselves at this white-hot new Flatiron brasserie that is a kind of love letter to chicken. Chicken in all its forms: stewed, roasted, placed in terrines, livers, etc. all prepared with a uniquely deft touch.The waiters here are super French and super over the top (et voila), like creepy dudes your friends introduce you to who are so good looking or have such cool accents that it doesn't really matter. The food walks a similar line, bouncing between crazy buttery/chicken-fatty richness and light, almost provencal touches.It all reminds me that the shape of love is one of negative space: it is that which surrounds the thing that is loved. The thoughts and feelings we get when we see someone, the ambiance of a place, the memories that surround a location: these are what love is--not something that exists within the thing itself.This restaurant is like that. It is a way of talking about chicken, about food, about togetherness that makes it great. The Fried and Crusty egg is wild--spilling yolk onto bright vegetables perfectly dressed with a combination of chicken fat and herbs. The consomme is one of the best soup dishes in all of NYC, the roasted chicken is godlike (sorry Rotisserrie Georgette), and the lobster and chicken fricasee is super rich, aromatic, and satisfying. I also want to shout out to the great dessert menu here.So, I recall this place and tears almost come to my eyes.

We also got 3 bottles of wine for a party of 4. We shared the profiteroles, which were delicious. Waiter had helpful recommendations. Now to the service issues. Firstly, one of our party had a cracked glass and they did not come back with a new glass for most of the meal. The most irritating part was they kept trying to clear our chicken/duck before we were done. Wtf? In the end, the waiter just quickly took the chicken without asking (and before we could respond) after he tried to clear it the first three times and we specifically said that we were still eating. Yea we took our sweet time by eating for 2.5 hours but we weren't deadbeat customers either. We bought the wines we got upsold on. The wines were good so the waiter did know something. But for over $100 per bottle, it better be good. So let us frigging eat at our pace and enjoy our wine and food. We paid for it and the prices are high here. It is too bad because I really wanted to like this place. I will say the host was extremely kind and tried to accomodate us to a non-high-top table (we didn't know we would be seated at a high-top) but they did not have the right table available. I will say I loved the food here. High quality cuisine. But at these prices, you need to have very good service and this experience was far from it.

5.0,4/9/2016,"Overwhelmed with the wonderful food and amazing hospitality. We arrived shortly after the restaurants opening on a Friday evening. We were offered seats at the bar while they finalized setting up our table. They had us seated right in front of their French-imported rotisserie, where we had the chance to watch the sous chef prepare the poultry. He had a great personality but unfortunately there was a language barrier. He tried his best to answer all our questions about the birds. Our server did a tremendous job explaining what made this particular particular restaurant so unique. The restaurants chef, himself, goes to local poultry farms, where he selects chickens that are resided under the most humane conditions. But what makes these birds so special is that they are allowed to mature much longer than your typical bird. On average, the birds served at this restaurant are raised to at least 90 days. (Fun fact: according to our server the birds found at your local groceries are typically allowed to mature for only 45 days). That extra time, makes the birds much more tender and flavorful. While the prices are somewhat expensive, you have to overlook that for the quality of the meal you are about to have. Unfortunately, most of their more exotic birds come in larger portions and our server recommended that we opt for the individual portions. We both went with the quarter chicken served with garden salad. The bird was truly flavorful. Sadly, it disappeared way too fast. Didn't realize how quick I engulfed them after smothering it with their chicken stock gravy. We ordered a side of fries, but the fries didn't particularly stand out. However, dipping them in the gravy did add some extra sass to it. We wrapped up our meal with a shared portion of vanilla strawberry vacherin: baked meringue, chantilly, ice cream and sorbet.

5.0,4/8/2016,"Absolutely divine, I can see why they must certainly do well in France. They take poultry to another level - from the sauces to the appetizers to the whole roasted birds! I think there were 4 or 5 different heritage breeds on the menu. We had a whole bird and the skin was crispy and delicious! Chef came out momentarily to greet a few folks and was nice. Will definitely be back.",0,0,0,T G.,"Venice, CA",3,71,53
4.0,4/7/2016,"I lived in the neighborhood and have witnessed this restaurant emerged from scratch. Walking by so many times I have noticed that they have a cooking counter like the sushi restaurants. Later after reading my friends Facebook I realized how famous it is in Paris. So we finally went to have a try.The ambiance was awesome. The food was delicious, though not that cheap it is at the acceptable level for a restaurant around flatiron and Gramercy. I have to say they have a very affordable wine list and we in the end had a $26 bottle of white wine and it was awesome. Don't forget to try the gigantic chocolate millefeuille!We even saw the chef!",1,0,0,Kiki Z.,"New York, NY",0,36,73
2.0,4/6/2016,"Been three times now and Le Coq has struck out each occasion. A couple of doors away The Gramercy Tavern sells better roast chicken in a less jangly room. One or two hits among the otherwise mediocre and overpriced chicken menu-- the seared foie gras and the offal appetizer (maybe they should come up with a better name?) are delicious and show what the chef can do. We're not big eaters and the whole chicken is skimpy for four, despite what they say.(BTW that seasonal salad is tiny and not worthy of a place with their pretensions). Deviled eggs half a step up from a church social, octopus tasteless. Poule au pot was as anemic tasting as it looked. Gravy is delicious.The over aggressive upsell of the wine (and dessert) at every opportunity is the other reason this place gets 2 stars. The charming sommelier tops up after every sip and is quick to empty the bottle and  suggest something more expensive. The bar area and main room gets very noisy even with the crowd of gray hairs that frequent the place.",1,0,0,john s.,"New York, NY",0,41,15
4.0,4/3/2016,"Charming. The brunch menu may seem generic with your typical sweet (french toast) and savory (eggs done every way imaginable) options, but each dish is created in a way that tastes nothing like I've had. I love how everything is so fresh here, starting from the bread that's sliced right before it arrives at your table.I was convinced to order the En Meurette and the Jerusalem Artichokes by my waiter (who speaks fluent French and is so thoughtful in giving recommendations). The En Meurette was small, but rich with flavors. Even though it looks soupy - one poached egg with some mushrooms, bacon, and two mini heart shaped (squeal) toasts, it tastes exquisite. Dip bread into the red wine reduction to soak up all the goodness.The Jerusalem Artichokes salad was also unexpectedly delicious with artichokes, super fresh greens, and sauteed chicken strips. The refreshing greens was an excellent companion to the heavier En Meurette.",1,1,1,Amy Z.,"Manhattan, NY",149,149,2
2.0,4/2/2016,"Took ma Boo out for Bday dinner.  Unfortunately, it was not a perfect evening and nobody wanna point out bad shieet then cuz you just wanna enjoy yourselves.We arrived on time and got greeted and seated immediately.  At one of the small tables in the hallway leading to the main dining room.  No.  If I gonna be dropping major coin I'm not gonna be having a Bday dinner at a bar cocktail snack table.  I ask for another table and the nice waiter accommodated the request after 20 mins. cuz the place be packed. And crazy noisy. But nobody ask if we want cocktails, just what kind of water while we waiting.  We get new table, new waiter.  He ask if we ready to order.  We like can we see your cocktail list.  It take a while to get our drinks but they be great.  We order eggz en meurette, eggz  mollet, seared foie gras, veloute of chicken, roasted cod w/ smoked duck breast, quarter chicken with salad, fries, macaroni au gratin, rhubarb souffle, dessert wine, and coffee.  Waiter takes our order without writing anything down.  They bring 2 eggz meurette.  I gotta send one back and wait for ma eggz mollet 15 mins later and by that time ma boo already finish eating their app.  The veloute of chicken was a gigantic salt bomb.  I guess they thought it be Aprils Fool day by dumping a cup of salt in the soup or croutons.  It was a shame cuz the soup started off ok and got saltier and saltier towards the bottom the more I stirred it.  I forced myself to finish it and my stomach regretted it the next day.  They never brought the seared foie gras and it was not on the check at the end so the waiter forgot.  WTH.  Lost revenue for you son.  The main entrees was good but the souffle was too egg whitey.  Cheaters souffle.Waitstaff friendly and nice.  I really wanted to like this place but maybe I try again in a few months.  Maybe I try Rotisserie Georgette next.",1,3,0,sleezy j.,"New York, NY",1,39,0
3.0,4/2/2016,"I came to this restaurant with very high expectations after having an amazing dinner at their original location in Paris. So I was kind of setting myself up for failure from the start. The service needs a lot of work. We waited for 30 minutes after our reservation to be seated and then waited an additional 10 minutes at the table just to get water. The waiters were running around, clearly overwhelmed, which led to poor service at every table. And to top it off, the food was good, not great. I recommend starting with the seared foie gras app as it was heavenly. The foie gras was buttery and delicious and the portion size was pretty big compared to what I have gotten at other restaurants. I had the quarter chicken for my entree, which was good, but not nearly as good as the chicken in their other location. The skin wasn't crispy (disappointing) and the chicken did not have a ton of flavor. The vegetable fricasee was boring. However, the potato puree was perfect- buttery, smooth, and paired really well with the chicken. I don't usually order dessert but the rhubarb souffle was incredible. Fluffy, light, and paired with a flavorful vanilla icecream. I highly recommend it. Overall, I would suggest waiting until this restaurant has figured out how to provide better service. It will make your experience a whole lot better.",0,0,0,Nina C.,"Westfield, NJ",2,47,0

The food was delicious (though it was outshone by the vegetables I recently tried to marry at Vic's). You must decide that you like the chicken and poultry menu.

1.0,4/2/2016,"Made an 8:30 reservation last night. Arrived on time and was asked to wait at the bar approximately 20 feet from the hostess desk. We waited there until 9:20 and returned back to the hostess desk where the young lady welcomed us to Le Coq Rico for the second time and told us that they were working on our table. As I was readying to leave they all of a sudden had a table!!! It was this tiny thing with two stools in a hallway by the bar. I thanked them and left.

3.0,4/1/2016,"Having had an amazing experience at chef Antoinne Westermann's restaurant of the same name in Paris' 16th, we had high expectations for his recently opened NYC outpost. Bottom line --- it needs work.Hostess was a space cadet, struggled to find our reservation, was rude when we rejected a table in the hallway between the bar and the main dining room. Not exactly the warm, friendly inviting welcome a new restaurant ought to project.The chickens are raised specially and delicately raised in Pennsylvania Dutch country and in the New Hampshire. Last night only two of the four varieties were available. The staff barely understands the menu and didn't or couldn't clearly explain what was in the artichoke salad.Service is good but not exactly attentive. Captan's were request visitors to the table inquiring about our satisfaction. Our quarter chicken entrees ($24) weren't as crispy as we expected but the kitchen took it back and made it right. Large cut fries were delicious and the dressing on the side salad was a great balance of sweet and tart. Dessert cheese plate and sorbets/ice creams were first class.An okay beginning. Hopefully they'll get this act on a par with Paris.",1,1,0,Fern F.,"Manhattan, NY",161,21,0

5.0,3/21/2016,"From start to finish we had a fabulous meal and service on Saturday evening.  I had the soft boiled eggs with salmon roe and the Maine lobster and chicken fricassee. Both were extraordinary and transported me back to France in a way no other NYC restaurant has been able to do in many years.  My companion had the seared duck fois gras and quarter chicken.  The fois gras simply melted in the mouth and the chicken - I, of course, had to try both, has a depth of flavor and tenderness that I've never experienced with chicken.  I had no idea!  Perfection.  For dessert, we tried the Ile Flottante - the most decadent one I've ever had, and two ice creams: cinnamon and Westerman spice blend, the former more subtle but my companion was nonetheless very happy. And feel free to load up on the bread because it's sensational and worth the extra calories!  The fabulous Chef Westermann was circulating between front of the house and the kitchen the entire evening, and very graciously greeting his diners and being helpful when needed.  I am torn between writing a great review and not telling anybody about Le Coq Rico lest I lose out on future reservations.  But it really is that good.  Eat here now.",2,0,0,Margot O.,"New York, NY",27,11,1

Space is charming, more modern and fancy than what you could expect, the kitchen bar with its open view to the kitchen is definitely where you want to share a bird with your pal while the chef himself will make sure that your dish doesn't get cold.The soft boiled egg with its butter soldiers brought me back to my childhood, the guinea fowl served in its cast iron cocotte was cooked to perfection, the chocolate millefeuille with its crispy and buttery dough had a taste of heaven which reminded me Paris.. But make sure to not miss the Baeckeoffe, a whole bird marinated and baked in Riesling wine from Alsace, signature dish from Chef Westermann and you will understand why.Wine list is precise, budget friendly and various and it features some very allocated wines.Thank you for this moment Chef Westermann and Welcome in the city!",2,1,1,Yona F.,"New York, NY",0,1,0
