5.0,3/14/2019,"As long time (3 generation) fans of Le Colonial, we decided to throw my mother's birthday party in one of the private spaces upstairs. It was the first time we had rented a space to bring such a large party together, and it could not have been more seamless from start to finish. The evening was so wonderful for us and our guests who still recall fond memories from that night. The service was superb- everyone was well taken care of and each need was anticipated, not to mention the room had been arranged beautifully and as we requested. We would highly recommend Le Colonial to our friends for their next event venue.",0,0,0,Eileen L.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",191,1,0
2.0,3/13/2019,"My thought is ""don't bother"". Seafood doesn't taste like they are fresh. Pan seared cod is kinda bland flavor. It has some kind of curry sauce at the bottom of the dish. I wouldn't not recommend the dish because the cod, bok choy, mushroom, and curry sauce do not go well together. Who even comes up with this dish? Feel like they just pick random Southeast Asia ingredients, put them together, and call it southeast asian dish. I generally like lotus root salad but the one I had here has a bitter taste. Not sure where the bitter taste comes from since lotus root is not supposed to be bitter. Pho is worse than the one made in a cheap Chinese restaurant. The Pho broth is such an insult, not even close to Pho. Im not looking for authentic taste or anything here, but Pho here tastes so lazy and seem like no effort was put in. Dessert is unimpressive. You can go to any bakery on the street and find better coconut pudding. Overall, Food is not tasty and totally a waste of money. I gave 2 stars for the decorations, music, and overall look of the restaurant.",0,0,0,Yelp User O.,"Somerville, MA",0,6,7

5.0,9/17/2018,"Le Colonial NY's atmosphere is refined and elegant!   I can't speak for all Vietnamese but our family has no stigma against dining at this restaurant or feel any shame toward its name. The 100-year French colonial period is a part of Vietnam's history as its legacy has complemented our fusion cuisine, written language, aesthetic value, and deepen our appreciation for perseverance in the face of adversity!  What truly shameful is to think Vietnamese food can only be great in cheap, rundown hole-in-walls in some sketchy, immigrant quarters.

5.0,6/13/2018,"We just had our first dining experience at Le Colonial this evening, and it was delightful, indeed. Our party of 5 appreciated the ambience and lovely, texture-rich decor, and we were welcomed by greeters and an unforgettable server for the evening: Joe. With a melodic and charismatic British accent, Joe was as engaging as he was informative and good-natured. Delicious cocktails were followed by fresh and delectable spring rolls to begin the meal. Next, we shared one of the most delicious and beautiful salads we'd ever seen: their lotus root & tofu salad in a lime-soy dressing (with the prettiest, pinkest radish slices, razor thin and beautifully positioned). We also shared orders of the 'Classic Pho', an oxtail broth that was savory and satisfying. We all ordered seafood dishes, and it was great fun to try each other's.  Chilean Seabass in a banana leaf with glass noodles, Alaska King Salmon in a red curry coconut sauce, Pan-seared cod with lemongrass crust, shitake mushrooms and bok choy, and 2 orders of the Seafood Stir Fry, abundant with shrimp, scallops and calamari. Each of us was so happy, not only with our own main entree, but with each other's too! Prices are a bit elevated, but that is to be expected when the food is fantastic and fresh, the service is exceptional and the ambience is truly wonderful.

Noodles were bit dry and clumpy.  - Profiteroles: A tiny dessert.Food: Good (3 of 5).Service: Very Good (4 of 5). The staff checked on us constantly to ensure that we were happy.

1.0,3/31/2018,"Big disappointment! We found this restaurant on Yelp, saw all of the great reviews and the overall rating and got very excited. The ambiance was very pleasant, the staff was pleasant and attentive. Our issue was with the food: practically every dish on the menu had added sugar. A chef who adds sugar to almost every dish lacks imagination, talent, and creativity. We tried 8 appetizers (an appetizer sampler plus a few extras) and a main entree called Bo Sate. The main entree included ""spicy emulsion"" sauce yet that so-called emulsion was sweet as if bottle of spices was mixed up with sugar.

Thank you Le Colonial for being one of the few restaurant week participants to have vegan options.Cocktails were delish and $8 til 8pm. Especially loved the lychee martini -- super smooth, strangely creamy, and sweetOf the food, the lotus root salad was the star. It was huge for a first course, so fresh and tangy, and filled with all sorts of good stuff: frissee lettuce, marinated tofu, thin-shaved raw lotus root on the bottom and crunchy fried lotus root on top. The fried lotus roots were like the most delicious chips you've ever had sitting on top of a bed of greens. Would return for this masterpiece of a salad alone!Friend enjoyed the eggroll appetizer, which was also huge for course 1 of 3 for restaurant week: 4 thick eggrolls with a mountain of lettuce and pickled turnips on the side for wraps. We both liked our mains as well: vegetable rice noodle stir fry, and the salmon. And dessert did not disappoint either! Loved the kick of heat from the mango coconut tapioca, and friend's exact words in regards to the chocolate lava cake: ""oh my god.""Service is excellent and the vibe is classy and upscale.

The chocolate cake was really good, not to rich or sweet. We were forward about the spaces of the paper that came on top of the cake, and my dates confirmed that yes, it was indeed very very hot!I would Definitely come back, not least for the chili-infused vodka, which my date said ranked up there with the best cocktails he's ever had.

We each had an app, an entree and we split a bottle of wine and dessert. I was pleasantly full but by no means stuffed. Most of their entrees are protein and veggies and not too high in carbs (that's how I justified the wine and dessert lol). Our server Joe was fabulous. I wish he could've pulled up a chair and dined with us.I think the best part was that they did not judge our casual attire and were not pretentious. Although we did eat very early before it got busy.

It arrived and was the size of an iPhone 4 in a banana leaf over a small spoonful of noodles. Now this portion size would be perfect if I was rationing food or expected an appetizer, but this was an entree. It was bland, so I added chili paste to give it flavor. The service was nice and attentive, but it can't redeem a $36 entree that was consumed in 4 bites with underwhelming flavor.

After half an hour, we were seated next to the entrance and hallway so while dining, I just felt uncomfortable people walking back and forth past our table. I dont know but for me, It kinda ruins the atmosphere. It is a fancy restaurant and has a very nice ambience and decor.  Maybe they should not just put a table in that corner.

Frankly, their regular menu is overpriced. The restaurant itself is very cute and fits the name. It has a touch of old school charm and the decor and shutters made me feel I was on a French colonial plantation. The food is good and very flavorful. We enjoyed the chicken sandwich and beef salad entrees, but the chocolate cake was the star. Service was lacking though.

2.0,1/30/2017,"Tried the pre-fixe during restaurant week - unbelievably bad value. $42 got me an uninspired lotus and tofu salad, in which half the lotus was raw and there was an incredible abundance of raw onions. The caramelized chicken with lemongrass, which were just cut-up pieces of chicken fillet, came with no vegetables or rice (just sauteed onions in the sauce) and tasted about the same as a hole in the wall takeout place. Saving grace was the coconut tapioca pudding, I suppose. But by far the most unpleasant part of the experience was the hostess, who was ""service-oriented"" in a strangely aggressive way that made us uncomfortable. Every time we said thank you (as in, thanks for taking our coats, thanks for showing us to our table, thanks for handing us the menu) she replied with a monotone-bordering-on-hostile ""No, thank you for joining us tonight. Thank you for coming to dine with us. Thank YOU. Thank YOU."" Every time. Twice, when we said sorry, (as in, sorry I've got this heavy backpack, can you check it with the coat, and sorry, I think I'm in your way) she responded with ""Do not apologize to me,"" and not in a friendly way, but in a ""I am here to serve you and someone told me to speak this way.""

3.0,12/24/2016,"**This review is about the take-out experience**I've never visited Le Colonial, but I just had it for dinner when I went to my mom's colleague's place tonight and we ordered take out. For the 5 of us, it took a bit of time to prepare all the food we ordered (it felt around 30-40 minutes) but it was fine as we were sitting down and chatting in a warm apartment. I had the Chao Gio (shrimp & pork spring rolls), the Bun Ho'i with chicken (steamed buns), Bo Luc Lac (filet mignon), the vegetable fried jasmine rice and the coconut tapicoa pudding. The Chao Gio comes with 4 in the order and the Bun Ho'i has two in the order. I hate two buns, all 4 spring rolls, my entree, a bit of rice (I shared it with 2 other people), and a little bit of the pudding (I shared it with 2 other people as well) and I was very full afterwards (although I do have a bottomless stomach so for the average appetite, that would probably be a lot of food).Even though it was take out, the food was still fresh and delicious (we picked it up right when they were done cooking it) and I really enjoyed the meal!I'm not well verse in French-Vietnamese cuisine and I've also had Vietnamese food a handful amount of times, so I can't exactly attest to how authentic it is. The flavors were all very light and familiar tasting, so I'm not sure if it's Americanized or that's the French aspect of the dishes. I didn't pay for the meal (thank goodness because I was looking at the prices and lawd jesus), but I would probably only dine here again if my mom was footing the bill (haha) because it's extremely pricey. I would have given 4 stars but dropped it down to 3 because of the price.

4.0,8/26/2016,"I'm surprised by the negative reviews. This time I'm actually glad that I ate here before reading here. I went to this restaurant for the first time last week for restaurant week. Having never been there before and not knowing was to expect, I was pleasantly surprised. First the décor and ambiance: this restaurant is beautiful. I loved its vibe. I felt like I was transported - to where I don't know - but I liked it :) It kind of had an old school chic charm, if that makes any sense. I thought the staff was very nice. The hostess sat us right away even though we were super early for our reservation. The waiters were also very attentive. The food: I was really happy with the portions since I usually feel like most restaurants are kind of stingy when it comes to restaurant week. (I even took home leftovers from my entrée). The food was delicious. I had the goi ngo sen (lotus root & tofu salad) to start, rau mi xao don (stir fry mixed veggie with rice noodles ) for my entrée and bittersweet chocolate cake for dessert. I do agree with the others in that I got more of an Asian taste with the food so I'm not sure how the French works in. I did get all vegetarian dishes and those tend to be more Asian flavours than French so maybe that is why...? The service: like I said, I thought the service was exceptional. Everyone was professional, friendly and attentive. The only small negative thing (and my only reason for not giving it 5 stars) was that the bathroom was upstairs (up a long flight of stairs), which doesn't seem very handicap friendly to me.

The service was extremely attentive and kind. I had the Saigon gin cocktail, which was absolutely refreshing and delicious. They serve shrimp chips and hoisin as their starter, which is a cute touch. We had the summer rolls and sugarcane shrimp for starters. Both were okay, I preferred the summer rolls as the sugarcane shrimp was quite flavorless. For our mains, we had the bo luc lac and the 5-spice duck. The Bo luc lac was very delicious and tender with flavors that transported me back home, but certainly did not come with as much meat as you would expect for a +$30 entree and they were overly generous with the watercress. The duck was over cooked and dry. I love the idea of fine dining Vietnamese food. I'm very proud of my culture and its food. However, the way to go about this is not to just jack prices up.

The Chilean sea bass came wrapped in a leaf and the sweet flavors were so light that it really let the fish shine. It was perfectly cooked as well. I'd highly recommend it!

1.0,3/14/2016,"I want to start off my saying that the service in this restaurant is ABYSMAL. I have never met a worse manager, nay, human being, than the man that is the current manager. He is rude, uneducated, and completely lacking in any social skills. Make sure to ask zero questions, unless you're cool with being treated like some sort of food terrorist. I was with a friend who was gluten free, and he made sure to let him know how unwelcome he was. My friend ended up with some lame excuse for a salad because the waiters know nothing about the menu and the manager could not care less about the people eating in this establishment. Here's a tip- there's something called customer service, courtesy, and general human decency. Learn anything and everything you can about this subject. Maybe it'll teach you how to speak to your customers, maybe it'll show you how to treat the unsuspected just looking for some dinner, and maybe, just maybe it'll help you keep your job, because in a place like NYC, there are millions of servers and restaurants, and no restaurants reputation deserves to be destroyed by arrogant and lazy employees. Aside from that, the food is absolutely mediocre, bland, with no substance or creativity. I can get the same food at a local Vietnamese restaurant for an eight of the price. My Stir fry was dry and the seafood overlooked, everything tasted of salt, and the coconut pudding has the weirdest texture, I do not recommend either.

1.0,1/31/2016,"I'm so disappointed in this restaurant. My expectations were so high going in. You see, last winter, I was in Chicago for a conference and a friend who lives in the Windy City recommended Le Colonial's Chicago restaurant. He said that it was great. He was right! I kept on going back. Couldn't stop!  It was one of the best eating experiences ever! Even the pre-fixed menus were out-of-this-world. I can't tell you exactly what I had, but one menu that stands out in my mind included an appetizer that consisted of delicately fried shrimp rolls, crispy on the outside, tender on the inside and bursting with flavor, even the beautiful garnishes that surrounded the rolls were delicious, followed by a  dish of scallops on a bed of salad, perfectly seasoned, tender, juicy, and the presentation--a delight. Everything was in a charming wooden dish in the shape of a box. My dessert consisted of a two-flavored pudding that was perfection. Every night, I would leave the restaurant with a smile on my face and satisfied stomach.Fast forward to the NY restaurant. What a monumental disappointment!  I ordered a pre-fixed menu that consisted of boiled shrimp rolls, cod fish and tapioca pudding. The spring rolls came and they were  worst than fast food restaurant rolls as they were tasteless and cold. Evidently, they kept them in a refrigirator before serving them. They were in a regular dish, no garnish, no presentation. Bland as can be, when I looked inside, it was basically white rice and a tiny sliver of shrimp that was totally undetectable. The codfish wasn't bad, but no presentation and the portion was so small, you could eat it in a few bites. The worst was left for the last.  I've had better tapioca pudding out of a can. I left disappointed, unsatisfied and worst of all hungry. I had to get a bite somewhere else in order to feel satiated and mine you, I'm thin and certainly no glutton, but the portions were tiny.

3.0,10/24/2015,"Having been to Le Colonial twice now, I'm pretty confident in giving it a fair rating.The restaurant certainly has its merits. It's a unique find in the area of Midtown East, an above-casual venue that offers its take on French-Vietnamese. The interior is two-storied, and tables are elegantly set and spaced while the use of multiple bamboo plants and mirrors gives off an air of elegance.My first visit was for a dinner with friends a while back. I recall getting their Classic Pho as an appetizer; it's elegantly presented in a small soup bowl, with the necessary wedge of lime and a side of sriracha. The broth is very fragrant and light, with the necessary oxtail broth base filled out with rice noodles, sliced beef tenderloin, and bean sprouts. Simple and tasty, yes, but I couldn't quite justify the $10 price tag given the plethora of better pho options just a subway ride away. I also tried a basic Com Chien, or fried rice, with vegetables, eggs, and Chinese sausage - nothing particularly noteworthy nor memorable either.The same theme was present during my second visit, where I opted to visit for the two-course prix-fixe lunch. The Cha Gio, or Spring Rolls, were served three to an order, with a filling of ground pork and shrimp (which was very sparse) and a side of lettuce and Nuoc Cham sauce. They were well-seasoned and crisply fried, but the skin was too thin and almost broke apart first bite. The Rau Mi Xao Dun, a dish with a base of crispy egg noodles topped with Stir Fried Vegetables, was even more forgettable. The vegetables were under-seasoned and lacked any true flavor, which actually made the egg noodles the better part of the dish for me; some parts of the noodles which were under the vegetables had softened, which gave it some variety in texture and crunch.My final takeaways from Le Colonial encompass the fact that the venue and ambiance are wonderful, ideal for a business lunch or dinner or a nicer date option but the food isn't particularly noteworthy, nor does it live up to the claim of being ""French-Vietnamese"". For those in the area or with a business expense account to utilize, it'll certainly fit the bill... but there are better options to be found just a walk away.",15,6,8,Lori L.,"New York, NY",2244,608,6827

She listened to absolutely everything we were saying to each other and even interjected a couple of times in the middle of what I consider a private conversation. Highly unprofessional, I was literally baffled. My date also shared the same feeling after we left. I called the manager the following day to report my unpleasant experience as I do love this place.

4.0,12/3/2014,"Asian restaurant done classy, with prices to match.I popped in here for lunch. I've been once before for drinks upstairs, but never eaten in the main dining room. At first glance, it looks slightly intimidating, with the white tablecloths and corporate clientele that is probably 15+ years older than me. But I ignored the stares and settled into my table.I ordered the Le Colonial Pho and a salad which I forgot the name of and now seems to be disappeared off their website menu. The pho is an appetizer here, so you need to cross off any expectations of those big bowls from pho noodle joints. The presentation was spot on. They bring it out beautifully plated and pour the broth separately from an individual pot. The foie gras sits atop the ball of noodles over a layer of perfect beef. Sauces on the side. The flavors were delicious, and I couldn't get enough of the melty foie gras and rich broth. Portion was tiny, but I expected that. My salad was a plate of marinated beef cubes on a bed of greens, dressed with yellow tomatoes, onions, fried lotus slices, and pepper dressing. The portion also looked small, but it was filling! The beef was cooked medium rare to medium and complemented the delicious dressing. Overall though, it's too expensive for the amount of food you get, but it certainly is quality food.

2.0,11/11/2014,"As a regular to the Le Colonial in Chicago for years, I felt the need to finally check the one in Manhattan out to see not only how good it is but how it compares.The interior and decor is exactly what I expected. It's a nice, intimate space that is great for a date or a night with some close friends. As I got to the bar, I noticed nobody was there which is completely fine. As I sat at the bar, nobody said anything to me for 5 minutes even though it was not busy and the bartender was not making any drinks. I was not even given or offered water.  The bartender did not really say much at all to me in fact and kind of just stared at me upon the first interaction. I don't think he is pretentious, but probably just very inexperienced. By being a regular at the one in Chicago and having friends who work there, I know what goes on and not a lot was going on at the bar. Even the other stuff around the bar who saw me staring at them did not do anything. The service I received was completely and utterly unacceptable.Anyway, onto the food.* Classic Pho - I was excited to try this because the one in Chicago is far and away the best bowl of pho I've had in the world. I have it in good knowledge that it's also a very famous/well accomplished chef's favorite bowl of pho in the entire world (including places in Vietnam) as well. HOWEVER, the one in NYC's Le Colonial is far inferior to the Chicago one. Not only was it too salty, but it was very one dimensional. The soup was bland and while it wasn't bad, it wasn't that great. On its own, not even comparing it to others, it is average and not as comforting as pho should be.* Lobster Galanga - I was expecting more. The foam and side vegetables/fruit were slightly above average but nothing to write home about. I'll most likely forget I ever had this dish within the next few days. The lobster was nicely cooked but very bland with almost zero flavor. For the price, I was expecting something more really (even more lobster - I've had lobster rolls with 2X more lobster than this dish for half the price).I know I didn't have a lot, but based on my experience, I probably won't be back which pains me since the one in Chicago is one of my favorite restaurants in the world.

While the plating is beautiful and the ambiance is nice, the taste of the food is not special and I can't imagine going to Le Colonial unless I am entertaining guests. I was disappointed with the basic pho dish, as it is a very small portion that tastes no different than pho anywhere else. The service was relatively slow even when the restaurant was at only 20% capacity during a busy lunch hour.

2.0,8/5/2014,"The decor matches a place that I visited in Saigon which is now a historical site, so I think the feel is accurate. However, the dishes were an atrocity. I have experienced my fair share of upscale Vietnamese restaurants - more pricey, but a twist on the food. However, I felt that what we ate was more like the same dishes with several ingredients, steps, and cooking techniques removed. Bo Luc Lac - ok. As expected, the unique smokey flavor of the original dish is lost, but the beef itself was amazing and tender. I commend the butcher. Pho - ok. The broth should be clear and rich, but it was hazy and one dimensional. I sensed either a bouillon cube was used or a very disorganized collection of seasonings. The beef should be thinly sliced and partly raw when served. I expected that we would not get the many cuts of meat, herbs, etc, that come traditionally; instead we would have a simple take on pho, but something worthy like a consommé broth. Ca Kho To - the worst. I was appalled. This is one of the most basic dishes in Vietnamese cuisine. When you visit a Vietnamese restaurant, order this along with Canh Chua (a tamarind base soup with fish) as a baseline by which to judge the restaurant's quality of cooking. Firstly, the title of the dish implies that it is caramelized in this pot. The dish that we got had a great two slices of fish, but the dish was all wrong. It was just sloshing around in watery fluid. The delicious slice of fish had to be rescued from the sad, dismal pot. Note that I did not come to Le Colonial expecting traditional Vietnamese dishes for the usual price. I simply expected a unique interpretation or some kind of improvement on these dishes. Unfortunately, authentic or not, the dishes did not even taste better than what I could have picked up in Chinatown.",0,1,0,G P.,"Portland, OR",2,7,13

I really enjoyed the prawn with the coconut sauce. The dessert was disappointing. The tapioca with banana with just not quite what I was expecting. There were slices of banana in it and some were not even separated. The wait staff seems to refill my glass every time I sip, but doesn't intrude. This is good since the water glass is small.

Because we were seated at a small rectangular two-person table, it was impossible to fit all our dishes in the middle, and so I asked our waiter whether we could use the empty two-person table next to us to create more space for our dishes, particularly since the rest of the restaurant was empty, with the exception of a group of approximately eight, and three tables of two. He looked apprehensive, and said that he needed to ask the manager.We then asked for some rice, but the waiter almost started arguing with us saying that we didn't need rice since there were noodles in our dish. We mentioned that we wanted some to go along with the beef, but he almost refused to some extent. We gave up, and proceeded to nibble on our dishes while hoping that we could create some extra space for our dishes.10 minutes later, still nothing. 20 minutes later, I waved him over since he just seemed to be walking around at that point, and he said that the manager was still deciding. I told him that we were practically done with our dinner, and that it was a decision that should not take that long to make.The manager eventually came over towards the end of our meal, and asked us what we needed. By that time, we were just frustrated, and tired of having to repeat ourselves over and over again. But we clarified the situation with him, and he finally agreed to extend our table.  That debacle completely spoiled any appreciation we had for our dishes.Le Colonial seems like a classy, high caliber restaurant -- at least that's what the prices certainly told us. However, the service we received did not match such expectations, which is unfortunate given its potential.",2,0,1,Anie C.,"New York, NY",139,61,11

But every time I've dined here, the food is mediocre. On the last visit the food was pretty blah. We ordered: Cha Gio Vit, Banh Cuon, Aubergines, Bo Luc Lac.Cha Gio Vit were crispy on the outside and not too oily, but the filling was room temperature. Not warm at all!Banh Cuon had a very odd texture. It was slippery.... and there was too much sauce. Again, room temperatureAubergines were tasty. Sweet aubergines and spicy shrimp stuffing were a nice combination. Then again I love aubergines....Bo Luc Lac... Chewy. COLD.Service isnt great. Sometimes bartenders are quick, sometimes really flirtatious, sometimes they'll ignore you for a bit.

1.0,2/10/2013,"The only explanation for why the service in this restaurant could be so offensively bad is that it is some sort of avant-garde art installation masquerading as a restaurant so as to challenge and criticize western colonialism and service norms.  So if that is the case, art genius, I apologize. Five stars for execution.  Here are a few of the things that went wrong. A completely incomprehensible coat-check system, with one girl who would appear, disappear, and take one coat at a time (from a party of eight) every 15 minutes or so.  A non-existent host/hostess that, after finally appearing after 45 minutes,  got mad at us for taking up space in the lobby and not just sitting down to a table we should have known existed. A bartender that acted confused and border-line insulted by the concept of starting a tab for drinks before the rest of our party arrived. A bartender that could not make any sort of cocktail other than a gin and tonic. A wait-staff that could not write down drink orders properly, serve water, take appetizer orders correctly, or answer basic questions like does the shrimp fried rice have pork. (after telling us no, of course it had giant chunks of pork). A waiter who blamed the other waiter for failing to tell us that 5-8 dishes on the menu can't actually be ordered because they are out of the ingredients--in other words, an anti-special! And, my personal favorite part: the decorative photographs of Vietnamese people looking incredibly sad!So, given this service, the food was kind of beside the point, but it was fine. Nothing amazing, over-priced, and not always what we ordered, but nonetheless fine. While I can honestly say that almost every restaurant usually has something to recommend it to someone, this is not that restaurant.

It has a nice décor, white table cloths, and a somewhat formal atmosphere. The concept is French Vietnamese fusion, although I'm not sure I saw the French influence as much as I expected. I will say, though, that I heard many French speakers at the restaurant. The food is really good and portions are ample enough to sustain you. Unfortunately, customizing is really not much of an option and they are not very willing to accommodate many preferences, i.e., ""no mushrooms, light sauce."" Nonetheless, the food we got was great and I would go back. The service on the other hand was pretty terrible. The waiter was rude, short tempered, and very impatient with the questions we had. He did not even once come back to check on us after our food came out. Literally, not once. He did not come back to ask if we wanted dessert or coffee. He did not even give us the bill. He pretty much just ignored us after taking our order, I suppose thinking we were too much trouble to deal with because of our questions.

The Banh Cuon which is steamed ravioli with chicken was pretty good and maybe the best part of my dinner. The Ca Chien Gung, which was ginger roasted salmon had way too much pepper and a bit too much basil sauce. It actually made the dish a bit spicy for me. The Bun So Diep seemed pretty big, but it was mostly full of vegetable and don't forget about the peppers!! My friend said the dish was actually spicy too but she didn't know where it came from. The scallops weren't bad though. As for the Bo Sate, which is sauteed filet mignon- they diced it up and made it seem like it is regular pan fried beef that you can get at any Chinese restaurant. As for the dessert, I actually got my hopes up- but I got so disappointed. The waiter recommended this dessert which includes lychee and he made it sound really good. So I got that and it was basically two sticks with 3 lychee on each stick (the lychee was definitely from the can) and it came with a glass of red wine. I can totally make this at home. The green tea crepe tasted like any other crepe cake. As for the other dessert which included pear in it- my friend said it tasted like apple pie instead.

3.0,1/22/2012,"I love the atmosphere of this place, feels like you're back in Colonial times, hence the name, der!Being asian and growing up eating good quality vietnamese food in Sydney, Australia I expected this place to be bad. 1. because it was in Midtown East so it's catered to non-asians, and 2. because I know I can get cheaper in Chinatown or Queens, even though I've yet to find really good, blow my mind, knock out of the park vietnamese food in New York. What did we order you ask?Appetizers1. Aubergines - Asian eggplant with sauteed crab and shrimp served with chili garlic sauce. This was my favorite dish. The soft eggplant and the shredded seafood went really well together. I didn't get enough kick from the chili garlic sauce but it was a great dish.2. Chao Tom - Grilled shrimp mousse on sugar cane with lettuce, fresh herbs & spicy hoisin peanut sauce. This was my least favorite dish. This is a very common vietnamese dish. The presentation was great, they serve it bite size using the sugar cane as a skewer which is easier to eat as you normally get it triple the size so you have to rip out enough for each serving with your hand. The strange thing was that it came out green not orange and I think it's because they added chives so it didn't taste quite right, well to what we're used to. When I saw the sauce I knew it would taste different because it was a peach color and not dark brown which you get from the hoisin sauce. The prawn tasted 'chivey' and the sauce was too sour. It should be sweet. Entrees1. Vit Quay - Lacquered roast duck with tamarind ginger sauce. The duck was very meaty and lean but bland. It needed more spice but I guess the tamarind ginger sauce that came on the side made up for the lack of flavor. 2.Bo Luc Lac - Wok seared beef tenderloin with watercress, tomatoes, red onions & black pepper vinaigrette. I grew up eating this with my family back in Sydney at our favorite local vietnamese restaurant so I know what it should taste like. You could actually get this for a quarter of the price and it's probably the same price in Chinatown & Queens, yes yes, you pay for the overall experience and not just the food right? Anyway I was about to say that it was really good. The beef was tender and the black pepper lemon vinaigrette gave it some punch. Normally they serve it on the side so you can decide how much spicy and sour you want but drizzling it on top is a better idea as the acid from the lemon cuts through the meat and makes it more tender.DessertPyramid Chocolate Mousse - This obviously is not a vietnamese dessert. It's nothing to write home about, it's just a mousse but it was good, rich, creamy and chocolaty, exactly how a chocolate mousse should be :)CoffeeVietnamese coffee with condensed milk (cafe da) - You'll never go back to Starbucks drip coffee again! Actually I didn't order it my friend did but you should try it regardless if your a caffeine addict. The coffee if done right should be rich, sweet and fragrant. It's a great way to end a meal.Overall I give this place a 3.5 star, 3 star for food & 4 star for ambiance but I'm going to round it down. It's casual, romantic and as I said before Colonial but it's a great place for a first date, not that I know how a first date would feel as I'm married and haven't dated for over 10 years but you know what I mean. :)",1,0,1,Sylvia C.,"Manhattan, NY",47,29,2

Methinks not"" for 1 star seems way more appropriate than ""Meh.  I've experienced better"" for 2 stars, especially for the price.  If it was a $10 noodle place it would be ~3 stars",1,0,0,Peter S.,"New York, NY",0,2,0

3.0,1/4/2012,"Not a bad choice consider the location and its one of the very few places you can get vietnamese food with good service in a decent setting. The restaurant interior is a little run down, the floor felt dirty even though it probably wasn't. However the lighting was just bright enough for a nice cosy dinner, but not intrusively bright. The food was just OK. We ordered a variety of dishes, and non of them really stood out as uniquely vietnamese french, or just good vietnamese food for that matter. It's a more toned down version of vietnamese food that won't leave you with food comas or hit you with sweat inducing spice. I would consider their food was relatively light and refreshing, although not necessarily great, non were bad either.My boss took me here so I can't complain about the price.

Their special vietnamese coffee--really sweet---also transports one back in time.  To me this is a place where one enjoys a break from the modern hustle-bustle and the omnipresent sirens that abound on 57th street.

I was definitely underdressed (I was in jeans and a sweater, most people were in dresses and nice pants), but didn't feel too uncomfortable/out of place, probably because the restaurant was dimly lit.My friend and I both got the pho, and shared a plate of crispy rolls. Our waiter was nice, but it was easy to see that he was disappointed that we didn't order more food.The pho was good. It was on the skimpy side -- there weren't a lot of noodles in the bowl, the portion was small, and it didn't come with bean sprouts, basil, or any sauces that I usually get when I order pho at other restaurants. Compared to the pho I've had at other restaurants, the pho at Le Colonial is a tad tastier, but not by much.The crispy rolls were good as well. Though they were $11 for 4 small rolls, which I think is kind of pricey. I've had crispy rolls that were cheaper, and just as tasty(!), at other restaurants.For dessert, my friend and I ordered the pear and apple tartin w/ vanilla ice cream, and some cream puffs w/ chocolate sauce and vanilla ice cream. The pear and apple tartin was delicious! It was my favorite dish of the evening. I probably could've tucked away four slices of that tartin. It was sooo good! The cream puffs were okay, not as sweet as I would've liked. The vanilla ice cream that came with both desserts was probably the best vanilla ice cream I've had in a while.The service here was good and quick (that sounds dirty). We were seated immediately, even though we (read: I) were about 10 minutes late for our reservation. We had about three different servers, one took our order, one brought us our food, and one kept our glasses filled. The bathroom here is nice and clean.Would I eat here again? Probably not.

The latter wasn't that fantastic.. For my entree, I had the pho and side of vegetables that I cobbled together swapping in bok choy for another vegetable to be stir fried in garlic soy sauce. The beef in the pho made it worth $10 as we all know the meat in some of the noodle soups / noodle stir fries are always questionable... The vegetable on the other hand pissed me off. This is a Vietnamese restaurant with I hope some knowledge of staple asian vegetables. I'm Chinese and have been eating asian vegetables for oh... 26 years.  Do not try to pass of BOK CHOY for Napa Cabbage. Completely different in color and texture. One is translucent white with dark green leaves, the other yellow-green and LOOKS LIKE A CABBAGE.

The short rib special was literally all bone with half-centimeter portions of fat attached to the bone. Really??? The vegetables did not seem fresh, as if they came from a can. The portions were very small and we ate something else after we came home from this restaurant.

It's like spring rolls you get anywhere. Tthe Chao Tom (shrimp on sugarcane) redeemed the roll. My sauteed butterfly shrimp had a lot of unncessary fried angel hair noodles on the plate that did nothing for the palate. A salad might have been better and healthier.

The yams and beans were more than good, but not incredible. The sauce was very mild which I think took away from the dish, but my Dad said over time the heat built up.

The hostess was a beautiful young woman dressed in a Saigon long dress. The waitstaff was very very attentive and friendly. I felt the food was very good, but I've had similar food elsewhere for a 100xs priced less right here in NYC!!! I'm really paying for the locale and the decor and attentive waitstaff. It still deserves four stars for all the to do with the decor and waitstaff.

3.0,8/2/2009,"My dad and I went here for lunch on his birthday about a week ago. He'd been to dinner at Le Colonial before and loved it, so I was expecting somewhat more than I got. The ambiance is really lovely and actually reminds me of what Cuba must have been like (you know, before Communism). It has that Havana feel to it in my opinion, even though it's a French-Vietnamese restaurant. The service was fairly good, and our waiter was attentive. I wish I'd known then what I know now, that all those diet coke refills from his attention were NOT free. I live in Florida, and it had been a couple years since my last trip to New York. I'd forgotten that diet coke costs 3.50 for a very VERY small glass. But I digress. We shared the spring roll appetizer, which is fabulous. Then I had a chicken dish and my father had the scallops. While he received plenty of large, sumptuous scallops with his entree, I barely received any chicken at all. Actually, I received tofu first, which is not at all what I asked for. When I sent it back, they just took off the tofu (neglecting a piece) and threw some chicken on top. Barely any for the price one pays to eat at Le Colonial. The dish was mostly bok choy, actually. Finally, we had dessert. Unfortunately, the chocolate pyramid I heard so much about from my dad was unavailable. I had the apple tart with ice cream and he had the pear and apple tart with ice cream and caramel sauce. We were pleased with both. Honestly, for a lunch that cost over $100 with tip, I wasn't too impressed. I know it's New York, but I've been to about a thousand fabulous places in that city for the same money that blew the doors off of Le Colonial. Just sayin'.",0,0,0,Ashley H.,"Orlando, FL",244,386,23
1.0,7/28/2009,"I had booked a reservation at this restaurant for a party of four on Opentable.com two weeks in advance. While the reservation was for 7:30pm, my group arrived at 7pm and were told that our table would be ready as scheduled so we went upstairs and had a cocktail while we waited.  At 7:30pm I went downstairs to see if everything was ready and they informed me that it would just be two minutes, but I noticed a look of distress in the maitre d's eyes when she looked at the manager because they could see that I noticed that a group of about six people, who had just come in off of the street with no reservation, were being seated immediately. I called my party to come downstairs and then the manager came by and we got another, ""just two minutes."" After 30+ minutes of waiting and being told ""just two minutes"" one of our party members went in back to check and saw that all of the tables were packed; they had given our table to the other party without a reservation.After that we began to complain to the maitre d' and the manager who claimed that they were holding the ""best seats in the house"" for us and meanwhile we saw him calling his staff to break apart a table meant for eight at the very front (and worst part) of the restaurant. We told them that we wanted the table that was originally reserved for us and not some makeshift, second-rate alternative. Then he tells us that that was not possible.So after all of the craziness we decided to leave and search for another restaurant in the neighborhood, after spending our time and a lot of money on their $13 drinks. The next morning when I checked my email I saw that it's showing a canceled reservation on Opentable.com, which is not true. After hearing good things about the food, we had our hearts set on Le Colonial and spent over an hour there being treated horribly. I want it to be noted that it was because of the unprofessional behavior of Le Colonial staff that we decided to take our business elsewhere.

The upstairs bar is pretty nice with plenty of tables and intimate seating. The plush stools in front of the bar are really low and not really friendly to sitting down. Looks posh but is really a hazard. I near slid right off of one. Thus, I opted to stand. My group just hung out by the bartender instead of sitting around a table.The bar is pretty standard and fully stocked. I heard that the bartender makes excellent mojitos. My group settled for beers.

From a helpful coat check, to attentive wait staff, to gorgeous decor, to delicious food to prices that didn't want to make you choke.  It wasn't the most extravagant or exquisite meal I've had but every aspect of it was above average which made for such an enjoyable meal.  Plus, this was first time I had eaten French/Vietnamese. Some of the purists on here say it's not authentic. Maybe not, but I'm not one to judge being a mostly Irish girl myself. All I know is, I loved it!i will say I enjoyed the appetizer we shared (a crepe with shrimp and crabmeat with so many delicate flavors) and the desserts more than my entree.

I split 4 appetizers (chicken ravioli, eggplant, chicken and cabbage salad, and veggie rolls) and the roast duck. Most dishes were bland: the eggplant was tasteless, the chicken and cabbage dull and cold. The veggie rolls were decent (but not as good as Doyers).  The only dish I'd order again was the duck, it was succulent and tasty.I'd avoid this place unless your party really favors ambiance and service over food taste.

Its just really cozy but spacious. Really welcoming. The food is excellent. Cant go into details as I'm not familiar enough with Vietnamese food. I have to say that their spring rolls are scrumptious. Beef with lemon grass is just refreshing. There are so many good things in this menu!  For main courses the Steamed sea bass is a favorite. Besides that the Clay pot chicken is just delicious. Grilled lemon grass chicken yum.. i don't know what to recommend! Well yeah.. the sea bass is a solid choice all around. But the skewered beef is very good too. Here you just have to go with what you like.  Their closers... desserts are beautiful to look at and tasty. You might really not want to eat them as they look like cute figurines. I haven't had many of them though. The banana beignet is really nice, very sweet. Chocolate pyramid is mouth watering and great for a chocolate lover.  And the smooth coconut rice pudding cant be left out. As for a must have, id say... Vietnamese coffee. This one on its own could be a dessert. Its served to you with the coffee brewed right on top of the cup. Hot water is dripped slowly on to delicious condensed milk or sweetened cream.
