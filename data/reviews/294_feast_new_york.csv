4.0,4/13/2019,"Three of us had a lovely dinner here earlier in the week. Two of us shared the multi-course tasting menu.  We were able to substitute out the brussel sprouts (HATE those!!) for a cheese plate.  The cheese plate was great, the arancini were delicious, the bass with lentils was wonderful, the steak was good, the butternut squash gnocchi were ok, and the apple cranberry crumble was good.  An thinking that I might have left out one other appetizer item, but I'm blanking.  Our other friend had a burger and seemed very very happy with it.  I wasn't a fan of the cider I ordered -- turns out it was a sour cider variety -- but I can't hold that against the restaurant.Wheelchair accessibility notes:  One decent-sized step up to enter.  I noticed that there was a a blue wheelchair sign lying on the hostess station as if it was going to be mounted in the window or perhaps had been mounted in the window and came down.  From the outside, I didn't see anything offering assistance to wheelchair patrons.  There's plenty of room to accommodate a wheelchair patron at the tables.  The bathroom is large enough for a wheelchair and has a horizontal metal pipe installed to one side of the toilet that could work as a grab bar.  The sink is mounted on top of a sewing machine stand.  I think the water would be reachable, but it would depend on the physical condition and flexibility of the patron.",0,0,0,Meg S.,"Manhattan, NY",3,137,0

5.0,4/5/2019,"Looking for a decent brunch place in NYC is actually kind of difficult for someone as indecisive as me because there are just soooo many brunch options out there, with that said - I am so glad that I found Feast! First of all, the brunch prix fixe was only $29, that is unbeatable in NYC! It comes with a pastry basket, which I absolutely loved and you can tell all the breads were freshly baked, a juice shot, and yogurt with blueberries and granolas (how cute is that). For the entrees, we picked the salmon avocado tostada - smoked salmon, with smashed avocado on a crispy tostada, topped with a poached egg and arugula salad; simple, classic, you just can't go wrong with that. What I thought was the highlight of the whole meal was the Beijing Egg Benedict - pulled duck on top of scallion pancakes with poached eggs. Such a genius idea that puts a modern twist on the brunch classic! The scallion pancakes were savory and flakey, the duck was tender and juicy; absolutely loved this asian fusion! The only complain I have is that I wish the portions were bigger!Oh yea, did I mention the prix fixe also include drinks too? Enough said. Overall, great atmosphere, super cozy and bright, friendly staff, and just a very pleasant experience. Will definitely return!",0,0,0,Mary G.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",125,8,29
3.0,3/31/2019,"Good but not very memorable. Our party of 3 was ushered to their basement dining, which was rustic and not a bad room but lacked the vibrancy of their main level dining.

5.0,3/30/2019,"Brunch brunch brunch, yes. Feast is an excellent brunch option -- pleasant interior, good prices, and great food. The prix fixe brunch menu ($29 as of 3/30/2019) comes with a juice shot (beet and pomegranate, in our case), a small basket of delicious flaky pastries, and a yogurt parfait with fresh fruit and granola mixed in. And all that is just to start!The brunch also comes with an entree, so we decided to get one sweet (lemon souffle pancake) and one savory (merguez stew). Each was fantastic in its own way. The pancake was crazy good, with lots of flavor and a really creamy texture, especially in the center. It melted in my mouth because of how soft the souffle center was.The stew was also great. Meat was cooked to perfection, and the polenta was the perfect texture to complement the stew and egg.The brunch price also inclued one free drink, alcoholic or otherwise. Lots of options for coffee, juice, or various cocktails.All in all definitely worth the price, what a gem!",0,0,1,Cyrus A.,"Manhattan, NY",154,138,167
5.0,3/28/2019,What a Feast! I went with a bunch of friends and boy was I glad. The lentil soup was quite delicious and somewhat original in that they kept the lentils in their original state - not mashed like most. It also had kale which the soup actually made tasty! For dinner I had the portobello naan-wich. I ordered it with the fried egg I saw on the menu and it added great texture to the wich. It came with chickpea fries as well which was perfect for dipping in the herb aioli. All in all worth a visit from my perspective.,0,0,0,Michael T.,"New York, NY",16,282,534

5.0,3/14/2019,"My friends and I love to go out for large-format dinners, so when I came across Feast's reasonable prix fixes, I knew that they would like my idea to make that our next stop.  The restaurant offered a Whole Hog experience that would need to be booked in advance, as well as general and vegetarian options that could be ordered ad hoc instead of going off the a la carte menu.  The 6 of us sat at a rectangular table and decided to partake in the traditional feast, which was served in multiple family-style courses.  As our mouths watered waiting for our first dish, we each ordered a cocktail from their unusual beverage list.  The Ministry of Love was a sweet, smoky, and herbaceous blend of mezcal, aquavit, manzanilla sherry, saffron, pineapple cordial, and lime.  Also before our multi-course experience began, we separately indulged in crusty slices of bread and a side order of Tacos.  Rather than using a tortilla, the ingredients were wrapped in a thick scallion pancake, adding an interesting Asian flair.  The inside was filled with black beans, trumpet royale mushrooms, and pickled cabbage.  They were delicious, but contained mainly cabbage.The first plate to arrive was the ""Fried Rice"" Balls, which were more Italian-influenced than Chinese.  These decadent bites were essentially fried mounds of creamy, Parmesan cheese and shiitake risotto.  The mushroom flavor really popped thanks to the infusion of truffle zest.  They were served with a tangy onion remoulade dipping sauce.  Aromatic fried Brussel Sprouts were tossed with lap chang sausage and dried cranberry, and then coated with crème fraiche and grain mustard.  The ingredients were a very intriguing combination that went shockingly well together, bringing spice and sweetness.  The main courses came next, centered around the NY Strip Steak, which continued that tangy and syrupy vibe with its bacon onion jam marinade.  The meat was tender and perfectly cooked to our requested medium rare.  The large, sliced steak was served over cooked peas and carrots.  The massive slab of beef was balanced out by plates offering seafood and vegetarian options.   The Bass was silky and its miso glaze encased it in flavor.  It was served over a bed of beluga lentils and seasoned with preserved lemon and a rich beurre blanc sauce.  The creaminess progressed with plates of Sweet Potato Gnocchi in a sage and hazelnut brown butter sauce.  The tender pillows of dough were tossed with Chinese bacon for a salty kick.  The main dishes were accompanied by crisp Taro Fries with a miso aioli.  For dessert, the chef surprised us with Baked Apples and Blueberries with a Crumb Topping.  It was a soul-warming dessert, perfect for the crisp winter evening and fitting for the restaurant's rustic farmhouse vibe.At $62 per person, the hearty and delicious menu was an incredible deal I would recommend to anyone.",5,0,6,Alison C.,"Hoboken, NJ",1125,1410,640

I ordered the Beijing Benedict which I really enjoyed as it was a unique take on the traditional eggs Benedict dish-  combining duck and scallion pancake instead. I also had a taste of the Lemon Soufflé pancakes. The pancakes had great texture but could use a little adjustment on the flavor as the tartness was overwhelming.Atmosphere was very charming and rustic with very good service. We made a reservation ahead of time and was the only table there at 11 am on a Saturday. The crowds started to fill the restaurant after 12.Feast is a great place to catch up with friends and would even make a nice casual date spot.

5.0,2/7/2019,"Had a delicious dinner at this restaurant for NYC Winter Restaurant Week! We chose this restaurant because it was one of few that could accommodate a large party (we ended up being eight people). The restaurant itself isn't that large, but we had a table right in front of the window and therefore a lovely view of the rest of the restaurant. The restaurant has a very cozy ambience with warm lighting and wood finishes. Unfortunately my friend got a chair with a faulty back, but otherwise I was a big fan of the decor. To start, I ordered the chowder. I'm a big fan of dishes that have ""pour overs"" so it was really neat to have the server pour soup over the rest of the ingredients. This soup was delicious--I could have kept on eating it for sure. As my main course, I picked the miso cod. I wasn't expecting this, because I had no idea what consommé meant, but the server actually poured broth over the fish (again, big sucker for pour overs). The broth was a bit salty, but otherwise the cod was delicious/flaky and worked well with the kale and mushroom. Lastly, I ordered the banana fosters flan for dessert. The flan was phenomenal and melted in my mouth. All the presentations for the dishes were great, and the dessert was no exception. Our meal took about two hours total, but the service was great and so was the food (loved the Asian influence). I would definitely return.",0,0,1,Tiffany L.,"New York, NY",351,140,223
5.0,2/6/2019,"Came here for restaurant week since it's one of the few restaurants in the city that has space for a 9 person reservation. Our table was definitely the largest in the restaurant and we got seated right by the giant window at the front. Didn't feel too crowded and the table had plenty of space. Started off with warm bread followed by the meal:""Chowder"": The fried dough/youtiao (they call it a cruller) was too fried and hard. The soup they poured over it was delicious; not too salty and had a good consistency. The uni and mussels were fresh and tasty. If the fried dough was cut into smaller pieces and softened, this dish would've been a perfect app.Duck Confit: Holy cow the crispy poached egg was amazing. I've never had one before so I didn't know what to expect but it might be my new favorite way to eat an egg. Very creative. The duck fat rice tasted just like fancy duck fried rice and wasn't too oily. The Chinese sausage added extra flavor. The dish was pretty substantial and very filling. The only issues I had with it were the super salty/saucy veggies.Banana Fosters Flan: I'm not typically a fan of banana-flavored desserts but this one was good. In fact, you could easily avoid the banana altogether because the flan and the banana were separate. The flan had a great consistency and wasn't too sweet. The banana came with butterscotch and rum syrup, which made it sickly sweet. Eaten together, it was a pretty good dessert!Very impressed by Feast's restaurant week menu. Definitely worth the price and the service was great. Loved the fun Asian-inspired twists to classic dishes and would come back for a regular dinner anytime.",0,0,0,Elizabeth L.,"New York, NY",19,99,237
4.0,1/23/2019,"I came with my family (3 people total) on a Thursday night. First impression, it's better lit in here than I thought! XDThere were only a few parties when we arrived but the place filled up quickly. Though it filled up, the noise level was really good and there was a very rustic and homey feel to everything. We ordered:AranciniBrussels SproutLobsterCodBerkshire Pork ChopIt was my first time having arancini and these were AMAZING. Fried, but not too oily and heavy, nicely rich on the inside with a crispy exterior on top of a bomb onion roumalde. perfect. Brussels Sprout were just alright in my opinion.I ordered the cod and everything about it, was amazing. All the different components separately were great but when you put them all together, absolutely excellent. Same with pork chop when I tried a bit. The only issue we had was the lobster pasta; nothing special and pasta was too soft so it became one large clump of noodles which became difficult to eat.They definitely live up to their concept of being a modern take on the traditional dinner party!

5.0,1/1/2019,"I had such an enjoyable brunch here with a girl friend right before Christmas.

They offer 2 tops and communal seating too. For the food we opted in for the all-inclusive brunch.Pre Fixe meal comes with a drink, assortment of pastries ie: scones, a shot of juice (green) and a yogurt parfait.  I selected the Beijing Benedict with hoison hollandaise, duck confit and scallion pancake.

When we came in, I really wanted a hot beverage (we'd been outside at the Union Square Christmas Market), but didn't really want a hot toddy, so the bartender whipped up a new beverage she'd just innovated for me... and sent us home with the recipe!We had: -Chicken skin crisps: we agreed these were slightly under seasoned, and I personally thought they were a little soggy. This was probably the one item we ordered that I wouldn't order again-Scallops: these were fantastic, and I loved the beluga lentils with them-Pekin duck: delicious and cooked to the perfect temperature, which is always a challenge with duck-Berkshire pork chop: to me, this was the standout dish of the night, with a perfectly tender texture and amazing mix of puree and greens-Taro fries: boyfriend loved these, but I thought they were a bit too dense-Cobbler: delicious, with a flaky puff pasty-Bananas foster flan: this was a complimentary dessert for the birthday boy, and while we wouldn't have ordered it for ourselves, we still enjoyed it. I'm generally not a huge fan of banana in desserts, but found this pretty goodTo drink, we had:-Graft Farm Flor Cider (him): a very sour, dry cider, which he enjoyed tremendously-Moon Gate cocktail (him): this was very alcohol-forward, and he found it delicious-A hot custom beverage (me): loved it!-Pineapple saffron soda (me): this was quickly and unusual, and while I didn't love the taste at first, it grew on me as I drank it.

Upon googling we discovered this seemingly cute symbol  is actually the symbol of an anti gay church-  the Hillsong church. (This was confirmed with the waiter.)

5.0,6/29/2018,"Brunch spot! Great food, friendly service, rustic atmosphere. A little loud but not too loud. They seemed pretty busy, but the service was on top of it, which is a lot to say. Brunch includes some appetizers - fruit shot, yogurt parfait, and a little pastry basket. All small, but big in taste. I love it. A lot of the times when I get brunch somewhere, I have to order these items separately (like the pastry basket), and it's too large and pricey (basically another meal instead of a starter), so I just never end up getting it, unless I'm in a group. Decent coffee even though it was burned twice... not sure how coffee gets burned for a second time... I got the Beijing benedict. Basically, eggs benedict with scallion pancake, shredded duck, and a hoisin spin on the hollandaise sauce. I wasn't sure what to expect, but it turned out pretty good. The key is to eat everything together, and it's very delicious. But, the dish is a little messy on your plate, and sometimes you end up eating things separately. And separately, the duck is slightly bland, the scallion pancake is much too salty and tough (was even hard to cut with knife). I enjoyed the hoisin hollandaise sauce though, but it could've been more hoisin-y to add flavor to the duck and cut the salt of the scallion pancake. Side of candied bacon. Wish the bacon was more candied though and a little less chewy. But it's good, and I'd still get it again. Service was great, nice and attentive.  And I loved that I could get a side of sauce/syrup (ketchup, maple syrup etc.) free of charge. This is important and definitely made my brunch experience all the better.

4.0,5/30/2018,"We are here recently for dinner for my sister's birthday on the weekend. They were nice enough to accommodate for our large group downstairs. For starters we ordered a few appetizers to share with the group while we waited for our entrees. I had tried the chicken skin crisps, tarp fries and Mac n cheese that we ordered a a side portion. The macaroni and cheese was combined with squash that effected the texture of the final product. I think if it was a little smoother it would have been perfect. The chicken skin crisps were nice and crunchy, like a chip. The taro fries were served with a creamy garlic aioli which was tangy and went well with the crisp fry.For the entrees they were nice enough to swap out the taro fries for home fries for my husband because he isn't too fond of taro fries, but he's just a bit picky. I got the mussels that came in a savory green broth of tomatillos, jalapeño and cilantro. It was also served with thin slices of toasted bread to use to dip into the broth. The mussels were evenly coated with the flavorful broth. There was plenty of mussels in the pot to eat and I did not come across a bad one in the batch.Service was really good.

We had the pre-fixe brunch which includes mini pastries, mini parfaits, and a juice shot before your entrée and one breakfast cocktail or unlimited coffee. A decent deal for sure. Food is well presented and satisfying. It's smaller portioned so this isn't a hangover or brunch with the boys spot but great for a girl brekky get together. We had the egg, pork belly, and polenta bowl and the avocado egg tostada. The avocado tostado was a nice change from the typical avocado toast and the polenta was almost like cheese grits. I recommend rezzy's because they asked if we had them upon entering and squeezed ourselves in at the bar.",3,2,2,Miriam M.,"San Diego, CA",330,302,620
5.0,3/19/2018,"Came here on Saint Patty's Day. We had reservations.The inside is rustic, woodsy.There's a faux, or real, stuffed animal in the back, on the wall. Really woodsy vibe.We got the pre fixe menu for $29, but you could also get a la carte.For the prefixe menue you get some drinks of choice, I got the bottomless cup of joe.It comes with a shot of healthy juice, you know the kind with wheatgrass and all that healthy stuff, bottoms up! a shot of parfait with oats, and a basket of baked goods, there were about 3 different styles.I got the steak and eggs, which was about $4 extra.  It was good. I asked for medium or medium well, but there was almost no pink, it was done, not well done, but done. Not sure if that's a level. I digress.They had the egg deep fried? But the center was still yolk-y.  It was new, and visually really cool. It came with potatoes and an arugula salad. The arugula salad was a bit to citrus infused for my taste, but the lady liked it.My lady got the salmon, it came with 3 pita bagel chips, we asked for more and they didn't charge. The eggs were good and the cream cheese for the salmon was good.Overall, the interior is really rustic, I like it.  The food was good, above average.  I'd be back if in the area.",0,0,1,Peter J.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",34,243,119
4.0,2/25/2018,"I've been to Feast a few times for brunch and the food is delicious. The menu allows you to have multiple courses so I've never actually been able to finish my entree. I've had the lemon soufflé pancake and the crab tostada and both were delicious, fresh, and filling. The decor and ambiance are very very cute so you definitely get the whole farm-brunch experience. The service is also very very friendly and attentive which is a huge plus. My one pet peeve is that it is a little bit expensive ($40+) which when compared to the quality of the food I think is a bit excessive. Be sure to make a reservation ahead of time during the weekends because they might not have tables available. However even when it's full, the noise level is very reasonable.

3.0,2/20/2018,I have dined in Feast for a company Christmas dinner party. They set us up downstairs at a long family style table. We were served many many small appetizer/tapas family style food dish after dish. Everything was very good but nothing to make me come back for. To get downstairs to the basement where we were setup you have to walk down small dark steep stars. The ceiling is very low and it's tiny in general down there so it's a bit claustrophobic. They also set up other parties down there which made it more crowded and impossible to have a conversation. There's only a bathroom downstairs so everyone dining upstairs comes down and waits right next to your table where your eating. The food is good the chefs really care about their food but the setup I just can't get behind.,5,0,3,Kirsten S.,"Staten Island, NY",522,493,3228
5.0,2/19/2018,"Came here for brunch on my birthday with my husband and some friends - what a great place!Decor/ambiance was lovely.All the food was excellent. The mini starters at the beginning made it such a treat - having a little bite of a variety of pastries, the yogurt and juice was so lovely - the mini scones were exceptional. Most of us ordered the tostada - the eggs were cooked perfectly, the dressing on the frisée was tangy and fresh. The combo of flavors and textures was really nice. My brother had the grilled cheese and tomato soup which he enjoyed. Everyone shared a side of bacon - the slices were super thick, lots of flavor. Service was A+ thanks to Brian, who took amazing care of our table. He took my coat immediately when I arrived, accommodated an extra last-minute addition to our party, made sure I had a drink while waiting for everyone to arrive (the 4/5 was down and everyone was coming from Fidi - so I was there for about 25 minutes waiting) and brought out a lovely shareable chocolate mousse dessert with a candle in it!We'll be back!

5.0,2/7/2018,Came here for winter restaurant week 2018. Overall everything we ate was delicious! Here's the breakdown:CocktailsModern Times 5/5 - I think they describe it well: a more drinkable negroni. Great for those tired of too sweet drinks but also don't want a bitter/alcohol heavy drink. Would definitely order this again but not a drink you would downFoodScallop Crudo 5/5: OMG this was amazing!!! Think raw sliced scallops in a creamy (but not heavy) and spicy sauce. Such a great start and the scallops were so fresh. Like a seafood butterPork chops 3.5/5: not sure why there's a +$5 supplement on this as it wasn't amazing but pretty darn good. Solid dish but nothing majorly wowingOxtail 4/5: this makes me think of chicken and waffles except oxtail and waffles. I was worried the meat would be super salty like I've had in the past but this was well seasoned!! I liked that it wasn't too heavy and there were some greens present (wilted spinach)Bread pudding 4/5: was tasty and simple. Nothing heavyApple crisp 3/5: I feel like I made something like this at home so not a show stopper. Exactly how you think it would tasteService 4.5/5: All the staff were attentive without being too pushy. I will say it was a bit annoying to get the bread at the exact same time as the scallop since we were both starving. The bread came or warm too so we felt obligated to eat this before our scallops (which were warming!). But I mean... 1st world problems. Overall: I really liked the atmosphere here. It's a bit loud and I did miss parts of my conversation due to noise but the decor and size of the place is cozy without feeling packed. Id love to come back and try the regular menu.

It came with a small shot of orange beet juice, tiny muffins, yogurt, bellinis and the main brunch course. A friend had an omelette. She said it was good. I had the lemon ricotta pancake. Unfortunately, the pancake was disappointing. It was too fluffy, too lemony, and very dry. There was not any syrup. My friend also ordered the pancake and found it to be bland.  (Although it looked pretty.) The restaurant is rustic and beautiful with touches of fresh flowers. The service was also very attentive. While it sounds like a lot of food for the price, I didn't leave feeling satiated. I would love to give it another try.

5.0,1/30/2018,"I have to start by saying how taken I was by the decor.  In the bathroom there was a wash basin  which was converted from an old Singer sewing machine.  The cast iron base and marble slab top provide a beauty that will out live us all.  In the dining area there were hay bale lifters converted into light fixtures. One table top was taken from a bowling lane.  Another table was a glass covered porcelain sink.  The retro industrial feel embraces you and takes you to a time when things were built to last.My wife had the scallop crudo, discs of scallop in a sauce developed from hazelnut, basil, pear, green curry, and coconut milk. She loved them.  I had a  salad with chrysanthemum leaves, kale, cranberry, parmesan  wafers in a nice dressing.  I have had chrysanthemum flowers in the past. They provide nice color, but little flavor. I thought the leaves contributed a nice mineral taste that enhanced the overall combination.We shared the bass and pappardelle entrees. Both were wonderful.  The bass was seared and came over a rice cake that had a crunch reminiscent of that nice crunch the Iranians get from scraping rice off  the bottom of there rice pots, though this was obtained through a baking technique.  The dish had kale chips that had also been baked.  And lastly, a kombu consommé was poured into a bowl transforming the other ingredients into an island.  The consommé had been developed with mushrooms and rice wine vinegar to enhance rather than compete with the delicate fish. Masterful.  The pappardelle was created by the kitchen, cooked perfectly, then combined with a smoked forest mushroom ragout.  It was then topped with a creamy scoop of ricotta. Out of this world.We finished with two deserts. The first was bread pudding with raisins, orange essence, and crime anglaise.  The other one was the Apple crumble with pistachios, pecans, blueberries, and vanilla ice cream.Service was attentive, and relaxed at the same time.I don't give out five stars often, but any less would be unjust.",1,0,0,Stuart M.,"Chevy Chase, MD",68,476,1652

The food was pretty good, especially the avocado tostada, but the beijing benedict was only okay. Unfortunately, portions are quite small and overpriced for what we were having. The main issue was that there is only one prix fixe brunch option ($29 or more for certain dishes) so we couldn't go there casually if we wanted.

I arrived about 15 mom before my friend but they sat me at our table and didn't rush me to order. Actually, they never rushed us at all throughout dinner. It was so refreshing. I had a glass of red wine but my friend order this delicious cocktail made with rum and sesame seeds! We were both very satisfied with the drinks. For dinner we ordered a bunch of items to share- fried chicken skins, shisito peppers, taro fries, mussels and Brussels sprouts. For me, the standouts were the Brussels sprouts for the delicious apple cider vinaigrette they were covered in. Also, the shisito peppers had huge flakes of salt sprinkled about which added to the tasty flavor. The mussels were some of the best I have ever had. They were covered in a coconut milk, spicy red sauce. They had pieces of Chinese sausage sprinkled throughout. The taro fries were also really delicious. They came with an aoli that for me was much to creamy. It had a very heavy mayo flavor. I would have loved something a little lighter with the nice taro flavor.

How great you ask; I would come back again just for the service alone. The place in general has a nice relax environment, great for a date or dinner with friends. Being that it's restautant week, it would have been wise to go with the prix-fix menu for $42. Not bad at all, but instead I opt to go with the regular menu. Menu itself has the right amount of items, not too small nor too large. Just perfect. Not so sure about the drink menu, since I didn't feel like drinking alcohol there was no point at looking at the drink menu. But next time, I'll definitely check it out.Anyway, on with  the food. For starter, I order the crispy chicken skin and for my entrée; the mac n cheese and burger. Yes!! All for me. What can I say.... I have a large appetite.The crispy chiken skin is a MUST!!!! I could just snack and snack on it. Crispy bite, perfect amount of seasoning. So good. The mac n cheese was delightful. The flavor of the cheese mix with either a pumpkin or some sort of squash was delicious.Lastly; the burger. Delicious.  I'm not a fan of Martin's potato bun because they don't hold well and after tonight, I'm still not a fan. But burger overall wax just delicious. Remoulade, the perfect seasoning on the burger. Everything was right on point. Like the crispy chicken skin, the taro fries that came along with the burger is another MUST! Something different from your ordinary potato fries. All in all, I recommend giving Feast a try.Don't just believe what you're reading, go experience it yourself is my say.

1.0,7/15/2017,"Really bad service. I would have walked out just from observing the server attitudes walking in. A friend chose to stay and we regretted it. The food was terrible but what left the lasting impression was two rude servers. The female server checked in first. When asked, we told her we were not enjoying the appetizer. She immediately removed the dish with great disdain. The male server came behind her and cleared our silverware as though we were no longer invited to eat. They were bothered when we asked for more drinks, charged us in full for the food they decided we did not deserve to eat, and never offered a replacement.",0,0,0,Michelle L.,"Manhattan, NY",0,7,2
4.0,7/13/2017,"For the most part I truly love this place. The small cozy atmosphere, the mood lighting, the friendly servers and the most exquisite tasty fusions of flavor that burst off every plate. I do love the complex flavors that read a tad pretentious on the menu but actually work really well. It's truly worth getting the Pre fix and trying all the great small plates that you share with a friend (only served for 2 people plus). What irks me about the place is that it does try way too much to be 'artisanal' (cringe just typing that word). A bit too irksome trendy especially the cocktails (all three of us ordered one each to try and each one was worse than the other) - sometimes odd random ingredients don't mix! Also, the acoustics of the place make for tough listening if there's a loud party in that room much nicer if you dine early when you can hear your party at the table. And on the irksome list, the matre d' found it really difficult to smile even when we were all trying to be friendly with him (other staff were great). I tad pretentious hipster business going on but the core menu and the food itself are worth a visit. Smile kids and serve some 'proper' drinks without eye of newt or whatever that was!",0,0,0,JN B.,"New York, NY",9,61,1
4.0,7/13/2017,I like this spot.  Small and unassuming and a million times better than some of the crazy-packed places in the area (and on the block for that matter). Pretty cool little bar set-up with a number of tables around.  The drinks are fantastic and they have some non-traditional local beers (south hampton and montauk IPA) when I was there.  Good spot for a date or chill dinner.,1,1,1,Josh M.,"Brooklyn, NY",379,459,52

3.0,6/28/2017,"Came here for a close friends birthday dinner and I have to say I was a bit puzzled as to why. Our group was fairly large (12?) and yet it was very hard for us to have a very inclusive dinner as the only seating they had to accommodate us was a very loooong table. A friend who had been there many times ordered for us, getting the kale salad and orders of the brussels sprouts for the table. The kale salad is fine and the brussels sprouts were very tasty, if a bit salty. As the one familiar with the menu suggested, we all either got the lobster, the burger, or the scallops. I, forever the seafood fan, opted for the scallops. I will say they were very good, however when I tried a bite of the lobster, I was unimpressed. It was pretty bland and for $28 I expect more and potentially a bit more creative than pasta in a creamy red sauce. The burger seemed pretty standard and their drinks were nothing to write home about. I think I would have enjoyed this place much more if it were a smaller group, as the service was also very slow for us (~160 minutes from sit down to check), and the atmosphere seems more suited to small intimate groups instead of large tables of celebratory post-grads.",0,2,1,Quinn Li O.,"San Francisco, CA",520,233,953

They have really original drinks- well balanced, delicious, and complex flavors no matter your liquor of choice. They're also really beautiful. My favorite is the Peace and Amity. The Modern Times is also amazing. Food: I did the a la carte menu with my friend which might not have been as great as the pre-set. My duck was a bit over cooked in my opinion but I loved their truffle fries! Vibe: trendy and hipster, with cute rustic touches. just sitting down made me automatically feel cooler.

The menu is simple but the chef make sure everything is cooked to perfection. My bae had the spaghetti with lobster. He loved the pasta is indeed handmade. The cocktails are good. I love how on the cocktail menu they put what type of glass a specific drink will be in (highball or collins). Also under each drink it will also have if the drink is bitter with floral undertones. That was a nice touch. The dessert we order was the lavender panna cotta. I just wanted more it wasn't enough.

Along with shared sides of the home fries and smoked bacon, it was more than enough- and worth the extra $2.While the menu is $29, many of the entrees entail extra charges, as of course do the sides, so the tab can add up quickly.

5.0,10/27/2016,"Might just be one of my favorite brunch places in NY. Here are the reasons why:1. Called day of and they had same day reservations 2. Prie fixe meal is a STEAL. Like seriously it's a steal bec it comes with a cocktail (mimosa, bellini, beery mary) + bread/baked goods + yogurt and granola + fruit shot + entree. HOLY SMOKES was it a great value, but not just that, the food was really really good. I especially liked my fruit shot, it was a mix of apple, celery, ginger, kale and tasted so good. I also liked that there were a variety in the baked goods - ex scones, madellines, bread.3. Staff was really nice. Their credit card machine was down for the day and they offered to give 10% if we paid with cash. That's super nice and definitely not necessary. 4. Decor - you get to sit at communal tables and everything is very rustic. I especially liked the empty frames with twigs and flowers in itAs for the food, we ordered the avocado tostada with crab and frisee salad and the steak frites with potatoes in a chimichurri sauce. I have to admit, I didn't read the tostada part and was kinda bummed that it was on a cracker rather than bread (can you tell I love carbs??), but was PLEASANTLY surprised. Scratch that, I was amazed at how good the combo was. The cracker didn't get as soggy as I thought it would and provided a very light crunch. All in all, that was my favorite dish of the day. The steak was just ok - it wasn't finger licking good like the crab toast, but the steak was cooked well. I wasn't a huge fan of the potatoes, they really lacked any flavor and wasn't very crisp. The side salad was a bit overdressed as well, but I did enjoy the fried poached egg. HOW DID THEY DO THAT? The yolk was perfect and the outside was nicely breaded.

In the restaurant, they have a bunch of tables plus a communal table with tall stools. They have a $29 prefixe menu that includes a drink, shares for the table, and also an entree. Lots of extra additions you can add if you want to shell out a few more bucks.For the drink, you can pick between a mimosa, bellini, a ""beery mary"", aperol spritz, fresh OJ, or bottomless coffee. I got the fresh OJ and man, was it refreshing after a night out drinking :)The shares aren't actually ""shares"" since there's enough of each item for everyone to get their own, but they are all shared at the same time. They are like mini bites of everything brunch you can think of, which is great because you get to taste more items. They had the bakery basket (came with 3 different types of pastries),  yogurt parfait, juice shot (i think ours was mango and papaya).

Their appetizers were of small portion, so recommend to get more orders. The assorted toast plate was by far my favorite, with crab salad and smoked salmon being my personal favorites. By the time we got to our entrees, only one order of the branzino fish was left and guess what, I was that lucky head to nail down that last piece! Seriously, it was that good - the fish skin was so crispy that it went directly popped up in my mouth!

3.0,5/9/2016,"Came here for brunch with a friend after hearing some coworkers talking about how great it was. I was pretty disappointed. We waited by the entrance for almost 5 minutes and no one came to seat us so we went up and asked the bartender/barista how to get a table. Finally they got the host who (despite walking past 4 empty tables on his way over) asked if we had made a reservation. Once we were seated we waited another 5 or so minutes for the waitress. She finally took our orders but she rarely came by to check on us for the next two hours. The menu itself was pretty underwhelming. I wasn't really excited about anything on there - it felt like it was all stuff I make for myself at home. Omelette, avocado toast, pancakes, etc. I ended up going with an omelette. Before my omelette came out they brought out little pastries (this was my favorite part of brunch), a mini parfait, and a tiny shot of green juice that I wasn't a huge fan of (although it could have been a nice twist to serve that in my mimosa instead of the oj). The omelette was pretty bland but at least it came with a salad so I wasn't starving. Overall, the food wasn't memorable and the staff avoided speaking to us so I don't think I'll be coming back. Definitely not worth spending $30 per person.",2,0,0,Rebecca V.,"White Plains, NY",2,37,6

4.0,4/8/2016,"Have been bookmarking this place to check it out and on a last second restaurant decision, decided to finally check it out. With no reservations, called them and was told that they had available tables - Thursday night around 7pm. We got there and was accommodated immediately to a table of our choice by the friendly and good looking host. The menu is simply and not overwhelming to look at and we were asked by both our server and the host if we had any questions which was very nice of them. We had decided on the market salad, side of chickpea frites, chicken (my friend's order) and the branzino. We were first served the bread with butter on the side and it was one of the better breads that I have had, not hard or dry but warm and has a slight chewy texture. The market salad was refreshing and was a good amount to share and the chickpea frites were healthy and not greasy as they were more baked than fried which was good along with the dipping sauce. My friend's entree which was the chicken - I felt was a bit on the dry side if not eaten with the sauce it came in, the chicken was well seasoned and a good filling portion, however the meat being not as tender was a slight minus. My entree of the branzino was pan fried to a nice crisp on the skin side and on the fillet side was cooked just right, topped on lentils (usually not my favorite), but in this case was very flavorful that i actually ate it. Overall the meal was very surprising, the flavors are all there, no over seasoning, hospitality of the personnel was great and not overbearing like other places, so you would not feel rushed with your meal and instead enjoy and savor every flavor of each dish. The experience is commendable and I have to say keep up the good work in terms of hospitality(customer service) and the food that is being served.",0,0,0,Esther L.,"Elmhurst, NY",2,2,4

3.0,3/12/2016,"5 stars for the decor, 3.5 for the food. Honestly though, for price alone this place loses stars. We came for brunch and were quickly seated (as mentioned in other reviews, reserving on open table was a total breeze here.) The staff was nice enough. We received the communal appetizers which were cute but TINY- 4 tiny cookies, 4 tiny yogurt parfaits, 4 mini scones, and 4 juice shots (beet and carrot I believe. A bit of an odd touch) for our party of 4. We waited a fairly long time for our meals, despite people around us who had come after us being served first. It was a little awkward because the waitress kept anxiously looking over at us without saying anything about the wait, but she was otherwise very sweet so we didn't mind too much. The meals themselves were okay to pretty good--the soufflé pancake stands out as fluffy and delicious.The price though. Holy cow. For $29 you get the itty bitty appetizers, the meal (also a rather small serving size,) and one drink...for two of us, that one drink was plain OJ in a 6oz juice glass, with refills that were $4 per glass. It seemed like a weird way to jack up a bill, but ours came to $44 a person after tax, tip, and rather expensive plain OJ refills.  Not terrible, just not worth that strangely high price tag.",0,0,0,Megan M.,"Union Square, Manhattan, NY",0,13,0

The prices were also a a bit too high for the quality of the food- good, but not mind blowing. - The gnudi, branzino, rib eye, and brussel sprouts were solid. The browned butter sage sauce was fantastic. The branzino perfectly cooked. The marrow was a nice surprise with the rib eye.- The salad, leek soup and mushroom tempura were rather meh. The tempura was more batter than mushroom. - The chocolate fondue was gross, the ladyfinger cake was like chewing on rubber, the home made marshmallows were sitting right in the fruit so they were soggy, and the fruit selection was off- overripe pears and sour granny smith apples didn't go well with the dark chocolate.

2.0,3/3/2016,Came here for brunch with a friend last weekend because the restaurant takes reservations which allows you to avoid waiting an hour on a Sunday for brunch. Was very optimistic about this place given the positive reviews but couldn't have had a worse experience. They cram all the tables into a really small narrow space which wouldn't have been so bad if a waiter didn't drop a heavy glass of water right next to my friend which shattered into tiny pieces splattering her everywhere with water. She was wearing flats and there were a lot of tiny pieces of glass on the floor even after they had mopped it so we moved to the counter. The bartender gave us both free mimosas so we felt a bit better...until it literally took an hour for our food to come. I ordered the steak and eggs which was pretty mediocre.

The juice shots were fun and helped me feel instantly better, and the little yogurt parfaits were adorable! And delicious. I got the baked eggs dish with some kind of meat, and I was a little disappointed. I make this kind of dish at home all the time, and it tasted like my amateur rendition.The coffee was very strong but not dark. I like a brunch place that can do a dark roast.

3.0,2/3/2016,"Came for Sunday brunch. Rustic, cozy interior. The brunch is prix fixe and a bit steep for what you come away with -- it's fair to say the portions here are not for you if you're looking for an actual ""feast."" The apps consist of single portions of a mini muffin, scone, couple tablespoons of yogurt, and a shot of juice. They're good but nothing hard-hitting or particularly memorable in two bites. Still, it's always nice to nibble on a few apps to mix it up on the palette! I will say the omlette with housemade ricotta was creamy and delicious without being overly rich. Several of the other entrees add a few more dollars ontop of thr prix fixe. I would be more likely to come back if I could just grab the omlette, without the somewhat gimmicky frills of the mini muffins and juice shot. No, not everything in this city has to be a deal, (let's be real, most things aren't), but I just don't think the prix fixe fillers were really worth what you pay for them, and actually detracted a bit from my review of the quality of the food overall.

They also didn't rush you to finish your meal or leave the restaurant. The juice shooter was my favorite. It was light and refreshing and seemed to be a mix of apple and other fruits. I loved the little scones/muffins/cookies as a start to your brunch meal. Cons-- The lox was slathered in pepper which overwhelmed the dish. The entree was listed to have a red flannel hash, but all it was underneath were slices of potato and beet. I tried my friend's potatoes (who ordered a different dish) and it also left a peppery aftertaste. For dessert, the whoopie pie's cake was too dry.",2,0,0,Kerry G.,"Brooklyn, NY",41,226,222

With the exception of that table, the other smaller tables were sort of set in dingy lighting. I felt like we were often ignored by our waiters because we were seated in such an isolated table, away from the brunching crowd upstairs.Additionally, the food, although beautifully presented, was way too salty. I had to constantly chug water and as I've mentioned, it didn't leave a great impression when mixed with the lack of service.

We also enjoyed the tzatziki dip, which was very fresh.  For dinner, the three of us ordered three different meals to share--the chicken and waffles, glazed rib and steak frites. All were terrific--the three of us felt all three were equally great. The hanger steak had an excellent preparation and was very flavorful, and the fries, excuse me, frites, were unique--soft on the inside, crispy on the outside, like friend mashed potatoes. The ribs had a delicious glaze with the right amount of sweetness. And the buttermilk coating on the fried chicken was light, flaky and delicious.  We would definitely return for another meal.

4.0,10/11/2015,"Brunch review only.  We chose Feast after searching Yelp to meet friends in this area.  While not a review of Yelp, I have to say that our expectations were properly set and met.FOOD is farm-to-table genre with classic recipes modified for the modern palate.  The menu structure is really nice.  They provide a small fresh juice, yogurt with fruit and granola, and a sample of breads along with a drink choice.  Drink choices are standard NY brunch fodder with a twist on the Bloody Mary theme.  We then choose an entree.  Our table went with omelets, salmon and Merquez stew.  Everything is prepared with care and served hot.The BAR is nice and features a nice trio of draughts.  My current good-health discipline meant that I resisted indulgence here.  I wasn't really paying attention so, not sure if cocktails are served here...DECOR is rustic country with lots of brick, unfinished wood beams, dried vegetation (what do you call those twig and thistle arrangements?).  Casually arranged wooden picture frames adorn the walls.  There are standard tables and community tables.SERVICE is extremely good.  I was greeted by the bartendress / hostess immediately and taken to the tables where the ladies awaited my arrival :)  Our waitress was charming and funny.If I lived in the area I would probably frequent Feast although we are only an occasional brunchers.",3,1,2,Phil G.,"Dana Point, CA",92,609,389

4.0,9/11/2015,"I came here yesterday with some friends. It's a really cute, small and cozy place. It's got a rustic look to it. We had reservations and were seated right away. Our waitress was really great. I forgot her name but she gave us great service and always had a smile on her face. So for apps, we ordered the smoked corn chowder, artichoke pizza and the gnudi. The chowder wasn't bad - it had a hint of sweetness and they put a few pieces of popcorn on top! The artichoke pizza was good but really small and we were all not too big of a fan of the gnudi. It didn't have much texture - just a bunch of mushiness. As for entrees, I got the pork 2 ways but they didn't have the spare ribs available, so it was really just done one way. It was a bit on the dry side. My friend ordered the cioppino which is like a bouillabaisse but she didn't like it too much because the broth had a very fishy taste to it. Another one of us ordered the fish and it was decent. Everything was on the good side but I wouldn't say it was amazing in any way.

2.0,8/2/2015,"My best friend and I went today for brunch. We got there around 1:00pm it was packed but we were able to get a table, the hostess said it would be best to make reservations  next time since the place gets packed quick. We got seated towards the back and given the menu and then automatically a waiter came around and gave us two mason jars with water, the water was warm almost tasted like tap water. Our waiter was a girl (I don't remember her name) the best waiter in the world she was so helpful and answered all our questions really positive.  My friend and I had never been there before and we had a lot of questions about the food even though we took our time before we came to the restaurant to look at the food and Google each food item. Our starters were okay. We got the granola parfait with peaches, watermelon and ginger shots, carrot cake, coconut cookies, and bread with caviar on it as our pastry basket. I couldn't finish my parfait due to the yogurt tasting like cream cheese and whip cream as well so I couldn't even get to the peaches, so that was not my favorite, my friend finished hers she loved it. Next was the juice shot I loved it she didn't, she didn't eat the the coconut cookies I eat both very sweet almost tasted like oatmeal not at all like coconut,I don't like carrot cake so she eat both of those and then me and her both tried the toast with caviar and agreed we didn't like that it had a weird burning tangling taste to it very gross. Then came to ordering the food I got the blackberry waffle and a side of bacon costed $8 extra and my friend got the wild mushroom pastry with scrambled eggs on the top and mushrooms on the side.   My food wasn't the best huge waffle but it was a bit burnt or a little over toasted and I was expecting that sugar to be sweet but it was very dull, the blackberry waffle came with black berry sauce and just made my already bland wheat Waffle taste worse. If that didn't help the whip cream was a weird light taste of whip cream and cream cheese talk about gross, the only thing that saved my meal was my side order of bacon (THANK THE LORD FOR BACON) it was peppered down a lot but it tasted really good shockingly it was a bit spicy but good, my friend said her food was really good she liked the eggs and the pastry was good but very thin and she wasn't going to eat the mushrooms or the spinach under her pastry. Our bill came up to $70.86. $58.00 for the starter including the food and then $8.00 for my side of bacon making it $66.00 and the $5.86 tax so that was a shocker and then for reference our waiter said that when dining at most Resturant you are suppose to give 15% tip because most of there money come from tips which I didn't know I just knew you were always suppose to tip when leaving a Resturant if you have the money. Overall wasn't the best food experience kind of a let down since I was super excited for this place, but me and my friend now know probably to not come here for brunch every again. She said it wasn't worth the price for food we could make at home but it's always good to try something new once, this was a nice experience we might try this place again for dinner but never brunch. Definitely pricey and maybe for people with  more acquired, exotic or universal taste buds.",0,0,0,Toniya D.,"Bronx, NY",8,12,42

5.0,7/27/2015,"Just celebrated my birthday with a feast at Feast and couldn't be happier! Everything from the food to the people to the ambience were absolutely perfect. When we first arrived, they were also getting ready for a larger party and initially sat us at a table that had stools rather than regular chairs -- it was actually a pretty cool set up, but since I had a couple older people with me (family) we asked to change and they immediately figured out how to accommodate us in a way that we were most comfortable. From there, the service continued to be impeccable. Our server was Margaret, and in addition to being great at her job, she was also very funny and personable (turns out she has a knack at stand up comedy and improv!) ...then there was the food. Oh. My. God. It's the kind of food that makes you want to talk about the food. And eat waaaaaaay more than can probably fit into your stomach, haha. It was all seasoned really well and an excellent variety fit for the summer season. There's no way you'd ever feel like you didn't get enough food if you order the feast (what they're especially known for) and Margaret was kind enough to box some of the extra up for us (which I just ate the next day and it was still fantastic). I can't recommend this place highly enough if you want a unique, cozy, classy, yummy experience.

4.0,7/24/2015,"I had a great time here after work on a Thursday. I was wandering around the area and did a quick search to see what was around. I saw all these Cajun/Southern call outs on their menu (gumbo, head on shrimp, chicken and waffles, grits) and decided I had to give them a shot.Brian, the awesome Queens native bartender, kept me company during my meal and chatted with me about the menu. Apparently the chef spent some time in New Orleans, and he even gave me some recommendations of places to visit and places to avoid when I visit. Thanks guys :) By the way, the menu on Yelp is completely out of date, ignore it and go straight to their website. I had a refreshing tequila cocktail to start that I can't remember the name of. I also tried their Bloody Mary mix which is out of this world, the BEST I've ever had. They put GARLIC in there, OK guys? Just go and drink it, it's magical and perfect and even a little spicy. I tried ratatouille for the first time and loved it. Lots of big garlic cloves with squash and tomatoes, just everything falling all over each other and delicious. I also had the Cioppino: head on shrimp, mussels, crab, and black bass in a mild tomato and garlic broth. Spot on. They also do brunch and their brunch menu looks awesome.

I love how the place is like a little sanctuary, rustic and garden-like; from the waiting area, to the bar, and the dining table, even the mason jar used as glasses, flowers and tiny plants on top of tables keep up with the theme of the place. The food is awesome too! Just like what the other people mentioned, the brunch prefix menu allows you to sample several dishes in an affordable price. I love the yoghurt parfait, and the mango whiskey shot. I'm not too fond of the canapés, but the oatmeal cookies and carrot bread are tasty. The star of our brunch is the shrimp & grits! At first, I was a little turned-off when I saw that the shrimps' head was still intact. I thought that it's going to make my meal difficult to eat, but I realized that the shrimps' body shell are already peeled off, so it's easy to dig in. The sauce is also delicious and the combination of grits and green veggies drizzled with vinaigrette is perfect. Our waiter is nice and attentive as well.

4.0,7/10/2015,"I had Feast book marked for quite a long time before making it over there. I heard a lot of good things about their brunch but I came here for dinner after calling five different restaurants for a last minute reservation for 4. I'm glad we ended up here because the food was really great. There are two main menus here. One is their seasonal feast which costs $68 per person and you get all the dishes listed under the menu and they are split among the table. Though it sounded good we stuck with the regular menu.To start I got the watermelon carpaccio ($16). It had about 8 pieces of thinly sliced watermelon with feta cheese on top. It was delicious but over priced. For my main course I got the cioppino ($36) which had mussels, clams, sea bass, and shrimp in a tomato broth with a piece of bread. It was super tasty and a pretty good portion. The other dishes that were ordered were the chicken and waffles which I think was $29 and extra $12 for the foie gras. It was the largest dish that was ordered which had about 4 or 5 pieces of fried chicken, a salad, two jams, and half s biscuit with foie gras. Another dish was the wagyu burger ($19) which my dad said it was the best burger he ever had. The last two dishes were the corn chowder ($11) and the side of ratatouille($10). I tried both and the chowder was ok but the ratatouille came with a delicious pesto sauce.They also serve complimentary bread that comes warm with butter and is SOOO good but extremely dangerous because I could eat it nonstop.  Overall I would highly recommend Feast.

5.0,6/28/2015,"Entering into Feast, you get a feeling of stepping back into a cozy cabin...with delicious contemporary American food that is. The brunch menu is a very simple $29 pre-fixe. You start of with juice shots, parfait, and a plate of baked bites. This was great to munch on while we got our food. Then there are a list of plates to choose from. I got the mushroom tart filled with scrambled eggs and mushrooms on top and hubby got the Croque Madame. You can also pick an alcoholic or non-alcoholic drink to come with your entree (bellini, mimosa, beery mary, orange juice, or coffee.) We got the mimosa and bellini and were pretty satisfied. There are also some upgrades including carafes of the alcoholic beverages listed for $20.Every piece of the meal was absolutely delicious and done to perfection.

It's different... good.Entrees come with starters- that's definitely a thumbs up.We started with moist spiced carrot cake and not too sweet coconut oatmeal cookies. Chased it with a watermelon grapefruit juice-- very fresh. Apple pomegranate yogurt parfait was very good and light. Lastly, had the honey goat cheese crostini.

3.0,6/17/2015,"Came here for brunch on a Sunday in a group of 5.  We made a reservation at around 11ish for a table at 1:30pm.  The restaurant has a Pinterest ""rustic chic"" feel.  Brunch prix fixe is $29pp for a drink (which I'll elaborate on), shared bites, and a main dish.Overall, it was an above average meal though I would argue that it's not the best brunch deal (especially in NYC, where there are endless options for brunch, and the service could really be improved.The drinks offered include a mimosa, a bellini, a ""beery mary"", oj, or bottomless drip coffee.  The orange juice is served in a teeny tiny glass, less than 8oz, and you don't get refills.  Seems kind of like a rip off.  Since it was hot out, we asked for iced coffee, which the waitress said could be served instead of the bottomless drip coffee (which is hot).  It was served in a mason jar and was about 60% ice.  In the middle of our meal, when my friend and I asked for refills we were told that since the coffee is cold brew, refills are $5.  WTF?  Thank you for failing to mention that before.  Also, if the coffee is cold brew, why are you serving it with so much ice?The shared bites are listed as a ""bakery basket"", yogurt parfait, juice shot, and canape.  The bakery basket is literal two tiny slices of a baked good (changes daily).  We got a sliver of a cinnamon bun and a sliver of carrot cake? carrot bread?  The yogurt parfait was a shot glass of plain yogurt with granola and some diced pears.  The juice shot was cantaloupe.  The canape was bread with ricotta and truffle honey.  They were all fairly average, except for the cinnamon bun and canape.  They were also all TINY.For the main course, I tried the smoked salmon with red flannel hash and quail eggs.  This was good.  The salmon was fresh, well seasoned, and went well with the hash.  I also really like the quail eggs.  The runny yolks were sweeter than regular egg yolks, and the combination of flavors was good.  It was a lot to eat though, and I wasn't able to finish my dish.Friend #1 tried the banana foster french toast.  The french toast was light and eggy, and the bananas and chocolate are a classic combination that works well.  She enjoyed this, although after eating about half of it, the overwhelming sweetness of the dish was too much for her, and she could eat no more.  We all tried it and agreed that while the flavors were good, the plate would have benefited from a salty or savory touch.Everyone else in the group (3 people) ate the fennel sausage eggs benedict.  The sausage in this dish was *incredible*.  We were all in love with it.  I don't know what combination of spices were use, but we all called it ""pho sausage"" because it reminded us of the flavors of the Vietnamese beef soup (and two of us in the group are actually Vietnamese).  The poached eggs were perfectly cooked with runny yolks and set whites.  This was everyone's favorite dish, although we all agreed that after a while, the dish felt very fatty and heavy. As for the service, our waitress really enjoyed taking away plates. sometimes before we were done with them.  I felt like I had to constantly keep my guard up when she was passing by, because if it looked like I wasn't actively eating, she might snatch my plate, even if there was food still on it.  At one point, she came to take away my ""shared bites"" plate and I had to tell her ""Wait!"" grab my cinnamon bun off the plate before she whisked it away.  What's the rush, lady??  It's 2pm. There is no line.  This also meant that as members of our group finished eating she would come and take away plates, even if other people were still eating.  It was very intrusive.  It also meant that for a group that was sharing food (we're close friends, all willing to let others try our dishes), we were eating over napkins and sharing utensils, since things were constantly being taken away from us.  What's worse, is after we were DONE eating and all the plates had been cleared, our waitress completely disappeared and we could not find her for water refills or to get the check.  We ended up sitting at the table for about 30 minutes before we were able to pay the bill and leave.  It was ridiculous, and kind of marred our brunch experience.",4,1,0,Ann D.,"Renton, WA",147,321,247
5.0,6/15/2015,"One of the best, if not best brunch I've had. Admittedly, I'm not a brunch diehard as I go once a month but Feast exceeded my expectations.Feast's brunch is a pre-fixe menu and the way it works is each person pays $29 for a brunch cocktail, assortment of cute pastries, juice shot, and a mini parfait, as well as your choice of a main dish. I especially loved this because I got to try a large variety of dishes and pastries in one sitting without feeling super stuffed. Everything we ordered was delicious so I'm pretty convinced that you can't go wrong with whatever main dish you decide on getting. On our table, we had the omelette, wild mushroom puff pastry, and eggs benedict - all of which were highly recommended by our charming waiter (and me having sampled all of them)! Even though the pre fixe is quite pricey for brunch, I completely felt like it was worth it. To add on top of the amazing food, Feast has the cutest decor and atmosphere.

The ambience is modern, fresh, cosy, bright.Service is nice.Tables large and comfortable enough.Brunch menu is small and with almost a sides to pay extra... Pastry plate really small. Orange juice glass is small too.My croque madame was more than delicious and big enough to fill my tummy  and make mi mind happy. Salad was nice and well dressed too.For some reason we were offered the oyster plate free, it was really kind of them. Maybe because we went at 11am and could not order an alcoholic drink per city law? Or because first time clients? Or because of us being very smiling, nice, sunny ladies? Wh knows. In any case, it was a $10 dish kindly offered, and I love oysters.That is why 4 stars arr totally deserved.With some efforts they would easily earn my 5th star!",0,0,0,Gessica D.,"Brooklyn, NY",62,228,1686

4.0,4/7/2015,"Brunch is my absolute favorite meal of all; I don't get around to it often because of infamous NYC wait times.  There are way too many restaurants in our city to be waiting 2 hours for food.  Thankfully, Feast takes reservations via OpenTable.Their country rustic vibe is an interior style that I love.  I imagine that this is how my own dining room would look.  The tables are communal; you'll find yourself comfortably sharing with other 'Feasters' unless you've got a large enough group.For $29, you'll receive:- A beverage of your choice: either one glass of mimosa, bellini, ""beery mary,"" orange juice, OR bottomless drip coffee.  - 'Basket' of pastries: rectangular plate of mini pastries to share.The sticky bun, loaf, and scone were all perfection.  On all fronts: the right amount of sweet.  I wished the portion sizes had been doubled.  - Yogurt parfait, juice shot, & canapéA nice lead-up into the main course.  The apple yogurt and beet juice were especially pleasing. - Main plate of foodI inquired about the pork belly benedict that many have referenced in their reviews.  The menu changed by the time I went- the waiter had never even heard of it.  Slightly disappointed, but I decided on the smoked salmon[red flannel hash, quail eggs].The smoked salmon was divine, and the cubed beet and potato hash paired nicely with it.  In case you were wondering, I got about 6 quail eggs on my dish.   The quail desperately needed seasoning.  I'm not sure if the blandness was intentional as to offset the saltiness from the salmon, but it definitely could have used salt.  My verdict:Portion-wise, it was just right.  Take into consideration that I had a bowl of cereal before I left my house.  Overall, the value of the meal was decent enough- not because the portions were large, but because I got to sample delicious bites ranging from sweet to savory.",0,0,0,Jenn F.,"Brooklyn, NY",767,372,2548

5.0,3/30/2015,"My fiance and I have been to feast a few times and it has never ceased to amaze us. When we brought a few out-of-town visitors here once, they gushed that it was the best meal they had ever had. We love the laid-back ambiance; the friendly, attentive service; the creative decor; and of course, the incredible food. Their menus rotate with the seasons, keeping each experience fresh and exciting. Most recently, when we visited on March 27th, we had the incredible 'Spanish Feast' with paired well with the albarino from Rias Baixas. How to pick a favorite? I loved the creativity of the 'eggs 3 ways',  and the 'crispy white anchovy salad' served on a leaf of endive was a beautifully balanced bite--anchovy can get intense but this time it was perfectly offset with the acid from the orange dressing. The sherry in the chicken consomme was a stroke of genius--tasted like Sunday mornings to me (long story). The chorizo broth that came with the clams was richly flavored and delicious, and we loved the pescado addition (possibly the most surprising and delightful part of the meal for me was the sardine escabeche). This all sounds like a ton of food but the portion control was spot-on; each dish was generous but the complete volume of food was not overwhelming--this is a tough balance to strike on a tasting menu! (So often either the portions offered are miniscule, or you end up overstuffed at the end.) All in all, the entire meal was creatively and thoughtfully prepared; we relished our entire dining experience at Feast and will be back again soon!",1,0,1,Jess K.,"New York, NY",2,21,5

Squid ink risotto, clams and chorizo, rack of lamb, plate of mixed pescado, sweetbreads to name a few. The menu is seasonal though with changing themes. Their spanish tapas theme for the moment is nice bc I love spanish tapas and pinxtos but the lack in flavor left our entire group miserably disappointed. There wasn't a single item we ordered that was particularly good. It wasn't horrible, it just wasn't any good. And for $68/pp ... I would consider it a major fail. Some of our plates came to us cold or lukewarm - dishes that had fried foods, like eggs and fried mussels.

Very unique concept as along with your entre, they offer a spread of small bites (likely lending to the name Feast) and they were very modern, fresh and original! Brunch itself is $29 to include a dish of your choice, the aforementioned spread, and a mimosa/unlimited coffee/juice as you like. Plus, they have fresh squeezed orange juice which I always appreciate! My friend ordered the eggs benedict and I had the french toast - both were fantastic. And the service was exceptional! So for me, Feast is a go-to for a lovely brunch in the city. I find it to be a fresh and inviting approach to a modern dining experience!

4.0,3/20/2015,"Brunch is one of my favorite meals during the weekend and one of the things that NEEDS to go with brunch is OYSTERS (yeah I'm kinda an oyster nut). I was searching for the perfect place that had a delicious brunch as well as my necessary oysters and came upon FEAST. Feast is a relatively small establishment with minimal tables/space, but we were able to squeeze in at the bar and it was perfect. 2 mimosas please!Now one of the coolest things about this brunch was that it came with small appetizer plates that included some croissants, yogurt parfait and other small deliciousness. The oysters (of course) came with this gelatin on top of it that my pal and I kinda childishly poked at. I asked the bartender what it was - apparently it's some fancy champagne topping that gives the oyster flavor a lil zest... uh OKAY! We slurped those babies down fast! and lemme tell you it was delish : ] Finally the entree.... imagine some delicious red, tender, meat. Meat that's so melt in your mouth delicious that you could probably eat it almost every day. Now imagine adding a benedict to that and BOOM that's what I had. Oh yes it's as good as it sounds if not better. Seriously this place did not disappoint when it came to brunch. They fulfilled my brunch desires and then some.

4.0,3/14/2015,"I went to Feast with my roommate for brunch on a Saturday morning - it was pretty rainy outside and we wanted something super homey with great food, and we got just that. The interior is small and rustic with a bar seating area and only a few full tables that can fit only six people. There's only one bathroom way in the back, so it can sometimes take a while to wait there. There's only one much larger table in the back for a larger party, but I would suggest going with 6 people or less so you can sit in the middle comfortably. The menu at first is kind of confusing - basically for the prix fixe you get one drink order, whether it is a mimosa, beery Mary, a bellini, or bottomless coffee. We actually got both the mimosa and the coffee, and everything tasted amazing - the tap water was served in mason jars, and everything was brought out in a timely manner. It took them a little while to bring out the appetizers, but it was well worth the wait - you get a small sip of kale/apple juice, yogurt parfaits, and a selection of tiny biscuits, muffins, and pastries. It was a great start to the rest of the meal. For the main course I got the Benedict with pork, which was delicious. It's really rich, but the biscuits are very moist, and the bites with spinach were extremely tasty. My roommate got the merguec stew, which she liked a lot. It was a thick tomato broth with sausages and 2 fried eggs on top. It was really good for dipping the bread that they give you on the side, and it was very flavorful.

I was a fan of the small bites but less so the entrees. I tried the pork belly Benedict which was very rich and thick due to the grits and the super buttery biscuit soaked with sauce. The pork belly was unfortunately very dry. It came with a soft boiled egg that is breaded and deep fried. Interesting concept but didn't really add to the dish which was just too heavy and salty overall. Also tried the croque madam, which turned out to be more of a grilled panini with prosciutto and egg. The egg inside was cooked all the way. Overall too salty again and nothing special. I also got ""bottomless coffee"" that they never bothered to come and refill. For $29 price tag I expected more.

5.0,3/6/2015,"So this is one of the best brunches I've ever had. And I've had many brunches, because let's face it, brunch is amazing.On a recent visit to New York, my friends and I decided we were going to go here for a Saturday brunch. We made reservations from Toronto. The day of, we were running a little late and called to let them know we would be 10 mins late. They seemed okay with this. 10 minutes after our reservation time, we arrive, and are told by the hostess to wait by customers seated and eating at the bar. 10 minutes of awkwardly standing around people who were eating, we asked the hostess for clarification as to where she had directed us to go. It was clear that there was about 20 empty seats, yet she kept us standing for an additional 10 minutes while ""they got a table ready for us."" We did not see any tables being made ready, and after 20 minutes of waiting, we were finally being led to the very back of the restaurant, where there was a long and very empty table (that had been empty for the entire duration of our wait). So we were pretty annoyed with the hostess, and we had actually been looking up alternative places to eat at while being made to wait.I'm so glad we didn't leave like we were thinking of doing. The food is absolutely amazing. It was so good that I'm giving this place 5 stars, despite intensely disliking the hostess's attitude towards us. We did the prix fixe brunch menu. We had a share plate of baked goods, yogurt parfait, (beet) juice and canapes. My friends and I all ordered the mimosas, and we also all ordered the short rib benedict (which was an additional $4 to the already $26 prix fixe). I cannot even explain how amazing the entree was. The poached eggs were crispy; fried panko crusted poached eggs... what?! Amazeballs. It was all on English muffin, with grits and this tender short rib. And of course anything with hollandaise sauce is just divine!Plus the whole decor of the place was so cute. Definitely a busy place, but so worth it. Despite the poor interaction with the hostess.

4.0,2/24/2015,"I'd caught notice of Feast prior to its fiasco with the Google Glass users [1], but despite several close attempts at making it there for dinner, I wasn't able to make a visit until much later in the year. Thankfully, the restaurant had rolled out a full brunch menu by that time, so a painless reservation on OpenTable was all it took before I met up with a friend of mine for a weekend meal. The restaurant is conveniently situated in Union Square, and at 12:30PM, was still filling up with guests. There's a fair number of two-tops as well as a larger communal table, which is ideal for larger groups or families, and the exposed brick walls coupled with the greens and flowers placed on each table gives the sense of being inside a farmhouse.For brunch, Feast offers only one set menu: a $26 prix fixe which lets guests choose a starting beverage and entree, and provides a variety of amuses and breads for the table as well. I opted for the bottomless coffee while my friend went for the mimosa, and after wavering a little on the decision of the main course, eventually went with what had initially caught my eye. Our drinks were quickly brought over, and I'll have to thank our server for filling it several times throughout the meal; I'll never turn down a little more caffeine at the start of a day.The amuses and breads were brought out shortly after. The latter were served in miniature sizes, and we got to nibble at a moist carrot muffin, a lightly sweetened white chocolate scone, and a rather messy sticky bun, all of which were tasty and tasted freshly baked. The former was served canapé style, and consisted of a refreshing cucumber consommé, a small cup of yogurt topped with granola and pineapple pieces, and a crostini topped with a sweet-savory dollop of truffled ricotta. All of these starting bites did the job of whetting our appetites, but we were certainly looking forward to the following course.Let's talk about this Pork Belly Benedict, though. Any lover of Southern cuisine should immediately gravitate towards it - after all, does it get any better than poached eggs atop a slice of crispy pork belly, grits, and biscuits? There's a handful of spinach thrown in (for color and variety, I assume), as well as a unique BBQ hollandaise that gives the benedict a smokey-sweet flavor. Each element was done to a tee, however, and I was surprised that the biscuit halves were able to retain most of their texture despite the number of ingredients that had been layered on top.I have to say that Feast does brunch very well, especially as they've reduced much of the uncertainty for their diners in offering a set menu. The quality in each dish was evident, and everything from the decor to the service only helped to ensure a good meal. I hope to return for dinner, which has even more options for both pairs and large groups... including a whole hog dinner(!).--[1] ny.eater.com/2014/5/23/6…",12,7,9,Lori L.,"New York, NY",2244,608,6827

My sleepy eyes definitely popped a bit after seeing that. We decided to do a la carte instead. More variety esp. since we were dining family style.Amongst the 5 of us, we pretty much covered the whole a la carte menu including a couple of the appetizers -- bbq shrimp pie, rice and bean croquettes, oyster po boy, duck gumbo, blackened swordfish, steak n egg, Scottish salmon, and the chestnut agnolotti. Oh yes, also a side of blue cheese steak fries. Everything was brought out at a good pace and the service was consistently great.Appetizer portions were extremely small but entrees were of standard size. Everything was at least OK but nothing I tried was outstanding. My favorites though, were the oyster po boy(crisp, toasty bread with a generous amount of oyster), duck gumbo(great flavor and duck was cooked well but not enough wild rice!) and lastly, the blackened swordfish -- my fave of the bunch. It was cooked perfectly and seasoned well, accompanied by delicious grits and greens. This is one dish I would order again. However, I doubt I'll be back. Great service, decent food but price points are way outrageous for what it is. This is a one visit spot.",9,1,2,Joanna N.,"New York, NY",848,415,2023
3.0,1/16/2015,"Feast has a pretty neat idea going for it: you can order appetizers and entrees a la carte, or to share as a pair, or much larger dishes that are designed for 3 people or more. I came here with 4 other yelpers, and as we scanned the menu, the thing that stood out (to me, at least) was the cost. Maybe I'm inexperienced with pricing, but $108 for black bass, even when stuffed with crab, seems steep. The salmon also seemed a bit much at $30 for an a la carte portion. Not one to judge a place by its dollar sign rating, I sucked it up and we went in to see what the place was all about.Feast has a modern rustic style that you've likely seen before: dark wood, uncoated metal, wire glass windows, edison bulbs, mason jars. You've seen it before, but they do it well. There were some candlestick telephones with the receiver replaced by a bulb socket, which I thought was pretty slick. Staff was friendly and eager to help. In fact, I'd say they were almost a bit too eager, at times. We had to mention that we were still working on food pretty often throughout the meal, but in all honesty, I'd choose too much attentiveness over not enough any day of the week.Between the 5 of us, we had: an oyster po'boy, bbq shrimp pie, and rice & bean croquette to start; then the duck gumbo, blackened swordfish, steak 'n' egg, scottish salmon, and the chestnut agnolotti, as well as a side of blue cheese steak fries.I enjoyed the po'boy, as well as the rice & bean croquette. Decently sized portions for appetizers, with flavors that aren't so strong that they'd ruin your palate for dinner.  The steak fries came out with the appetizers, and well, that's definitely a strong flavor. I love blue cheese so I didn't mind the steak fries, but I don't think it was the most popular thing at the table. At $7, the serving could have been larger, however.Later, the main courses arrived, all well-plated and presented. I was particularly fond of the swordfish, as well as the duck gumbo. Both were flavorful, with the fish having a really nice texture, and the gumbo being just thick enough. The steak 'n' egg had a decent texture for braised short rib, but the flavor seemed a bit flat. The egg was tasty. The salmon was moist and flavorful, and I was particularly fond of the skin, but it isn't something I can justify paying $30 for. I didn't find the chestnut agnolotti to be memorable. I can't really give an accruate measurement of the portions, because we did split 5 a la carte items as opposed to 5 items that were intentionally portioned for a table of 5. It didn't really seem like they were sufficient portions for one person. I was full of mostly water by the end of dinner (which the super attentive staff kept filled to the brim).I'm not opposed to spending a little extra on a drink, or a meal, but if I do so, I'd like to feel satisfied with what I eat, and justified about the cost. I really didn't feel either here, despite the friendly staff and atmosphere. So, one star per dollar sign.",5,1,2,DeShaun C.,"Brooklyn, NY",370,245,30
5.0,1/13/2015,"I have a rule against going to the same restaurant in NYC more than once, since there are so many to try. I've been here for brunch three times and once for dinner. Rules are meant to be broken, right?This review is just for brunch - the $26 prix fixe brunch is a winner. Definitely make a reservation, it's a small-ish restaurant that can accommodate either pairs or groups but whenever I've been there it's been full. Go with someone who likes to eat. To start, each time they've had different little starters and the pastry basket is drool-worthy (and if you're with a bunch of girls who love them carbs, they've been known to take pity and give you a few extra). It also comes with a cocktail; I'd skip the beery mary. Every entree has been delicious, whether sweet or savory you can't go wrong. I have to admit, the pancake is by far the prettiest item on the menu. You will leave very full, and very, very happy. The decor is adorable, with just the right amount of hipster thrown in (i.e. mason jar water glasses and bud vases). Definitely check out how cute the bathroom is. The service is impeccable and the waitstaff every time have actually seemed happy to be there and have worked to make sure the entire experience is pleasurable.

4.0,1/13/2015,"Went for the $26 price fixe brunch. It's a bit pricy if you just opt for the bottomless coffee, and a better deal if you opt for the cocktail (I watched a beery mary being made, and it had two shots in it! If only I hadn't showed up to drunk already hungover!). Still, the food was delicious. Usually when you're thrown a lot of food, as you are here (you get a set of starters for the table before your chosen entree), you can expect that they've maybe been sitting in the kitchen for a while and might be stale or iffy. Not here. Everything was fresh and delicious.The only reason I opted for 4 instead of 5 stars is because the service left something to be desired. We received our set of starters after our entrees actually came out, and nobody seemed to care.

1.0,1/11/2015,"Bad, overpriced food that took forever to get to our table, and really poor service. I wouldn't recommend it to my worst enemy. THE TAKEAWAY - $70 for cheap wine and a slider with a 90 min wait to get our entrees? Great deal (if you like burning money in your free time). Otherwise avoid it and hope for something better to open in its place once this dump closes (soon).THE REVIEW (read only if you like horror stories)Last Saturday we decided to throw a good friend a farewell dinner and after doing some research we decided on Feast. I wish we had chosen one of the other options...After arriving, our party of 13 was informed about the two menu options: the ""feast"" or ordering a la carte. The $68 pp ""feast"" is a family style dinner where different dishes are brought out for the whole table to share, and after checking the menu, which was composed of scrambled eggs wih duck, chicken soup,duck breast... Nothing too exciting (unless you like paying $68 for chicken soup and scrambled eggs), so we decided to order a la carte. HORRIBLE SERVICE - After a few more failed attempts from the waiter to push for the feast option, she threw a fit and said that it is expected for parties this size to always order the ""feast"", and that she would have to talk to the manager. I want to clarify that at no point did anybody communicate to us that we would have to get the ""feast"" when we made the reservation - it doesn't say it in their web site, it doesn't say it in their menu. Then along came the manager to inform us that if we decided to go with a la carte, it would be nearly impossible for the kitchen to coordinate 13 dishes (????). Ahm, what? We informed the manager that we wanted to do that anyway, and placed our orderHORRIBLE WAIT - an hour after placing our order, we were informed that the food was ""on it's way"". 30 minutes later our entrees arrived. It must be a record for the longest NYC wait for food ever, particularly considering what the food wasHORRIBLE FOOD - I went with the $18 ""lamburguer"", which should be renamed to ""lambslider"". It was literally one very small slider with what must be the cheapest buns on sale at Keyfood or Jack's 99. The FIVE fries that came with it were even worse - just disgusting. I tried a few other dishes from people around me and everything was terrible: $36 beef slices that came out cold, soggy pasta covered in foam (not tasty, more soapy)... What a disasterHORRIBLE VALUE -including cheap wine (not as in ""inexpensive"", it was $44 a bottle, but as in ""this must have cost you $1 at the liquor store""), and the food, the bill ended up being $70 pp. Ahm, not great.",2,2,0,Jose L.,"Murray Hill, Manhattan, NY",10,21,0

Meat was pretty decent. I liked that the meat wasn't tough or chewy.OKAY:- Lime Basil Soda - it was okay. I had better. CONS:- EXPENSIVE- Merguez Mussels - the mussels itself was good but I did not like that nasty chunk of meat that was mixed in with the mussels. I just looked up what Merguez was and apparently it was spicy mutton (lamb meat). If I had known it was lamb meat I wouldn't have ordered it. I don't like Lamb meat and Merguez enhanced that lamb taste which I hate. SO IF YOU DON'T LIKE LAMB DON'T ORDER THIS!- THERE WAS SOIL in their VEGGIES/MUSHROOMS in their CHICKEN & DUMPLINGS DISH. The chicken & dumplings itself taste okay but the veggies in the dish were not. I took a big mouthful of this only to TASTE SOIL & a NASTY CRUNCH in my teeth. Left a nasty residue.

The way things should work here is that you get your drinks, ""shares"" which are usually granola, pastries, juice, then ur main. This is how my meal went:I made a 1230 Saturday brunch res on opentable but got delayed and was able to make it 1 pm when I called which was much appreciated. We were seated immediately but the waitress came after awhile and apologized. We ordered coffee but it never came until the 3rd time that I asked for it from a 3rd person. The weird part is that all other tables seated before and after us got their drinks and shares before us. We got an ala carte item first then our mains and we had to mention our shares. Besides the service which I assume to be bc they were short staffed, the food is delicious!  Mushroom and scrambled egg puff pastry was well seasoned and fluffy pastry.

5.0,10/15/2014,"$26 Prefixe brunch. Do it. It was hands down one of the best brunches I've experienced in NYC. (And it takes reservations!)This place knows how to please people. The food was delicious and came out in courses. All plated up pretty and consistently yummy. Start off with mini baked goods and pastries. So adorable and just the right size so you don't get filled up on bread. My favorite was the sticky bun. Then they bring out a dainty set of appetizers. We got a shot of green juice (refreshing and I felt sort of detoxed), a crostata topped with tapenade, and yogurt topped with granola that was again- just the right portion. Although I could eat a whole bowl of the stuff, that granola was good. Then my soufflé pancake made an entrance. This pancake was beyond my expectations- so big and fluffy (I suppose hence the soufflé part), lemony and refreshing, and topped with macerated berries that were tart enough to cut through the richness. Plus the essential dollop of not-too-sweet cream. Wowza. These are not the Sunday morning pancakes I whip up at home. As it happens whenever I order a sweet dish for brunch, I get overwhelmed halfway through. That signals that it's time to trade plates. My S.O. ordered the baby back Benedict. Also amazing, not quite a huge portion but I think it would leave most feeling comfortably full. Benedict has been done by pretty much every restaurant, I'm a little tired of it. But this version with a bbq spin and cornmeal cake was pretty damn good. Super savory and unctuous but also a hint of sweet for balance. I highly appreciate that you don't have to order a cocktail with the prefixe - they have coffee for ppl in need of caffeine and also fresh squeezed OJ. Our server was so lovely and sweet, consistently came to check in and always smiling. The interior was casual cool and comfortable. All the other diners seemed just as pleased as we were.

5.0,10/7/2014,"Oh myyyyy, the pork feast menu!! l I have been to this restaurant three times, all for big family/friend meals. The food is pretty much overall delicious, the drinks are solid, and the service is great. The owner/manager will handle your call personally, and deal with you as you hyperventilate over the amount of family members you need to entertain - he'll also mix you a really nice cocktail; the wait staff is extremely friendly, and will put up with you changing your order, interrupting order-taking, etc. Yes, sometimes a drink comes out late or someone doesn't get a fork - whatever; the service is so friendly it doesn't matter. The first time I went, 8 of us went and split the ""whole hog"" meal - delicious, plenty of food, and a really fun thing to do; it was definitely an event.

Also delicious, plenty of food, good time, great for a group on a really rainy day; I don't know how the waitstaff was so patient with us.But I have to tell you about the pork feast option. I went last night for a birthday, there were 14 of us, and it. was. awesome. It was supposed to be the whole pig again, but the supplier messed up and the owner arranged for us to have the pork feast instead. HAPPY ACCIDENT.

The kale ceasar salad with pancetta was plentiful - I had three servings (what, it's a superfood) and there was still enough left over. The squash blossoms were delicious. We had pork rind tacos! For the mains, the differently prepared bites of pig were so good - the porcetta had everyone floored. Also, I don't even like broccoli rabe, but this broccoli rabe was delicious - not bitter (thanks, pig fat) and garnished with whole roasted garlic cloves.

First came the guacamole and salsa with three different types of chips. One of these was fried pig skin. I wish I hadn't known this as I would have felt less guilty eating all of it. The chilled corn soup didn't do it for me, but the mini tamales and stuffed peppers were tasty. There were a few other courses besides these that I can't quite remember. Each was a nice re-imagining of a classic Mexican dish. I had the unfortunate displeasure of going with two people who were light eaters and had decided to have a late lunch for some reason. This left me to do most of the heavy eating. By the time we got to the lamb, I was done. The lamb itself had nice flavor, but was a bit overcooked. For dessert we were given a very nice shot of tequila icee. During the course of this meal we also tried several of their cocktails, all of which were rather good.

My only suggestion is NOT to add the anchovies to the kale and bacon salad. Otherwise, all plates were delicious and plentiful. I must also mention the pork belly and gnocchi plates. Thumbs up on those 2 plates. Now for the not favorable part. If this is a tasting menu for a party of 5, why are you bringing all the plates out at once?! As good as the meal was, I felt rushed. I would have much preferred each plate to be brought out. When I'm eating such a meal, I love to savor and enjoy; really take my time. Unfortunately, this dining experience felt like all the food was being forced down my throat. Too fast. Too fast. Slow down! And then onto the service. Sorry guys but the service was unacceptable.

And THAT, I am into! That wasn't my drink though. I ordered the bottomless coffee because it's...bottomless. Sharing plates included zucchini bread, parfait, this watermelon emulsion, crab meat and scones. For the entree, I ordered the smoked salmon and boyfriend ordered the wild mushroom puff pastry and a side of bacon. I never thought I would say this, but they give A LOT of smoked salmon. The bread was nice and crispy and the salmon contrasted well with the beets and added to the absence of the salt on the potatoes. This might have been better as a sharing plate. I tried his mushroom puff pastry and really liked it a lot. Also, the side of bacon came with over 6 pieces of bacon! Not a complaint. However, bacon was more chewy than crispy. Unfortunately, I'm a crispy bacon type of person. In terms of price, quantity, quality and environment, I really do like this place a lot. It's definitely balanced in that aspect and yes, of course they have the Edison light bulbs, mason jars, wood and metal combo going on. Auto win! If I could, I would give it 4.5 stars.

Seated right away with no reservation. They checked on you often and would never be quenching your thirst with water. They came around often refilling your cup even if it was only half empty. They offered recommendations when asked and explained how the menu worked, since it was our first time. Food: drinks to chose from that are included with your meal are a mimosa, Bellini, beery Mary, oj, or bottomless cups of joe. We chose the beery Mary, which is their twist on the Bloody Mary with beer instead. Pretty tasty with a little kick. There was a set starter plate that included 3 different types of pastries, yogurt parfait, a healthy non-alcoholic green shot drink, and a cheese ravioli. Bite sizes, but good. For our entrees, we had the shrimp and grits and baby back Benedict. Both tasted delicious. The shrimp were huge - prawn shrimp with a tasty sauce.

We are vegetarians and appreciate having inventive, delicious and varied food options when dining out! Some of the dishes were more flavorful than others, but overall it was a great meal out.

5.0,5/27/2014,"I visited Feast as part of a brunch bridal shower for a friend. Feast has a beautiful rustic decor with aged wooden tables (or at least the large one in the back was). The bridal shower was switched to this restaurant after another restaurant we reserved a table with gave us a hard time about having a ""party"" without renting out the space. Feast didn't mind at all that we were throwing a small party and even offered to help us with the decorations we brought in, as well as move their table decorations to make it perfect. Additionally they took video and photos for us several times throughout the festivities. They helped us connect to the wifi so we could Skype in people who couldn't make the party. They were very accommodating in terms of the time they gave us, allowing us to linger around the table before sitting to eat and long after we paid the bill. I found the food to be really wonderful. The brunch comes with one beverage, shared appetizers (you get all of them, so no need to pick) and then one main dish per person. My bellini was standard, no complaints there. The appetizers included mini yogurt parfaits with fresh made granola, a shot of carrot ginger juice of some sort, and assorted sweet rolls and breads as well a deviled egg half. It was all delicious and just enough to hold you over as you chat with friends and wait for your main meal. I got the croque-madame, which was a spin on/fancy ham and cheese. It was on pressed/toasted egg-dipped bread, and included a side arugula salad. The only complaint I would have here is that the salad was a bit overdressed but really, the food was delicious and the portions were reasonable. Another girl at the party got the eggs Benedict with the short ribs. I didn't taste the eggs but it looked so good and the short rib was really tender and tasty. I was truly impressed with Feast all around, but especially their customer service. They were so accommodating, our waitress was very down to earth, friendly, fun, made us very comfortable. I would really like to go back for dinner.As an aside, I heard all about this Google glasses thing though I haven't read any articles. My review has nothing to do with that issue, however I'm very glad that the service and food here was so great, and allows me to contribute a great review to their Yelp page to counter act some idiots who don't know how to act in a restaurant.

5.0,4/25/2014,"This restaurant and the staff are fantastic. It's a perfect mix of great food in a classy but casual, uncovered wooden tables, farm-to-table vibe. They hit all the right notes if you're looking for an experience that's upmarket with a lot of attention to detail and going to impress someone who's a foodie, but want a casual urban-rustic feel rather than white table clothes.I took a group of 12 people there for dinner on Wednesday and had an excellent experience. Pretty much every interaction was impressive and left me feeling good. I don't normally write Yelp reviews but it was exceptional enough that I figured I should make the effort to share the experience. Details:FOOD: They have 2 prix fixe menu options (or you can choose from an à la carte menu). One is vegetarian-only and cheaper, and the other is French-inspired and includes meat dishes. We went with the meat option. Every dish was delicious. the chicken was wonderful, there were some succulent fish plates, and vegetable dishes, and the dessert selection at the end was excellent. Portions were generous.DRINKS: They had some great cocktails and selected some kind of New Zealand white wine for us that people were still talking about how great it was later.SERVICE: We milled around for a while as people arrived and they were happy to get drinks started and never tried to rush us. After we arrived and had been enjoying drinks for a while and talking, I realized we should put our orders in. With no advance notice, they were able to start bringing the food out in literally 10-15 minutes. I couldn't believe how quickly they brought it out, for so many people. They must anticipate a certain number of orders of the prix fixe options in the kitchen and begin prep once the restaurant fills up.STAFF: The staff were super friendly in an unobtrusive and accommodating way - they just made the good experience happen without getting in the way or interrupting unnecessarily. And it doesn't hurt that they're quite cute too.BOOKING: I was able to book for a large party just 2 days in advance. They called to confirm and let me change the numbers without any fuss.I'd previously only dropped in here once or twice for a drink, but having had the full dinner experience, I'm definitely going to go more often.",7,0,1,James S.,"Manhattan, NY",114,5,0

5.0,3/22/2014,"Review for Cajun Feast (8-top)We decided to throw my mother-in-law's 70th birthday party here, because of the communal element and because we all love Cajun food. I find it kind of amazing that New York, which has 'everything', barely has any Cajun offerings. We were a group of 8, and they let us order 2 feasts (farmer's market and Cajun), though I realize they usually recommend the same feast for the whole table. We very much appreciated being accommodated in this regard. Seriously, not since I was in New Orleans eating the real deal have I had Cajun food this authentic. Apparently the chef worked there for several years, which explains a lot. I feel like we ate so many different things I'm going to miss one for sure but I'll try to summarize:BBQ shrimp pie - perfectly cooked shrimp and that sort of thinner, ultra-flavorful bbq sauce that I had in NO, above delicious sweet potato puree. The rosemary breathed through the dish, bringing it all together.The spinach salad had this spice in the dressing that I was sure was white pepper, but the waitress let me know it was actually the horseradish/garlic. It had these duck cracklings atop which I ate almost all of despite the intent to share it among four others. The beets here were awesome (not usually a fan), but they were marinated and cubed and had a totally unique flavor. Oyster gratin was off the hook (I ate two of these). Pancetta & artichoke crust was brilliant. If you don't understand the love affair between pork and oysters this is a great way to learn. The pork belly/crawfish po'boy (on a house brioche) was a miniature marvel. I haven't had real crawfish in an incredibly long time, I only wish there was more.The duck gumbo was [expletive] amazing! Never had dirty rice with liver before, but it almost seems like the 'proper' way to do it now. Duck was cooked perfectly, served atop house-made andouille and this arousing roux. I can't say enough good things about this one.Grits and greens were classic, and the blackened swordfish was cooked perfectly. You could really taste the shrimp essence in the butter, which I thought was cool. I barely had room at this point.I didn't eat too much off the farmers market feast, as I was trying to give the vegetarians at our table a fighting chance, but I can tell you the brown-butter gnudi (basically like a ricotta gnocchi) was so good I tried to hide it behind my water glass.All of this was finished off with a King Cake with a plastic baby inside (with a birthday candle for mom). I really felt like I was in New Orleans by the time this one came around.The most important thing - my mother-in-law had a terrific time! I wish I could write a more balanced review but there was not a thing I disliked here. The only downside is I think they've moved on to a St. Paddy's day feast in place of the Cajun (I guess they switch them up fairly frequently), but you know where to find me next year around Mardi Gras.",1,0,0,Jesse P.,"Hastings-on-Hudson, NY",20,35,1

My girl friend thought it was cute when our waiter tried to hit on us-- thanks for the flattery, but we are way too old for you!Brunch is $26 and comes with:-a drink: mimosa, bellini, beery mary, fresh oj, or coffee-a bread basket: chocolate croissant, regular croissant, and corn muffin-tiny bite of an amuse: we had deviled eggs on a small square of toast point-shot of juice: ours was carrot mango-shot of yogurt parfait: for us it was apple, plain yogurt, housemade granola-entree: we ordered the smoked salmon and eggs benedictThe dishes were beautifully plated, but the actual quality of the food was unmemorable. While everything I ate was pretty good, nothing really stood out. We also ordered a side of bacon ($7) which was house smoked and crunchy, but not mind blowing. Brunch may sound like a lot of food, but in actuality, I felt that it was a bit expensive for $26. My girl friend ordered an extra cup of coffee on top and it was $4!**TIP: They will discount your bill by 5% if you pay with cash!",3,0,0,Cissy Z.,"Manhattan, NY",188,81,116

1.0,2/14/2014,"A few weeks ago, I began the once annual quest to plan a nice valentines day evening. I saw the great reviews for Feast, and made a reservation for tonight.I looked at the menu today, and found out that there will be a valentines day prix fixe menu tonight. Not only was this not posted before, but the price is 25% higher than their highest priced prix fixe menu on the normal menu, and the options are completely different from what they would normally serve. It is by no means a normal menu, and you and your significant other share the entree. This isn't what I ordered...I called them to check that this was the case and confirm, and in fact they only posted the valentines day prix fixe this week! (Keep in mind, all reservation were made weeks ago.) Valentines day in NYC requires planning. Restaurants are booked far in advance, and I find it outrageous that Feast has suddenly decided to charge exorbitantly more than they usually would, for a more limited menu, and without any warning to all the poor guys like me who actually took the effort to plan valentines day far in advance. Needless to say, I have cancelled my reservation here.",6,6,2,Matt G.,"Hoboken, NJ",238,166,10
4.0,2/3/2014,"Small, cozy, dim-lit place. Food and service is wonderful. Seated at the bar the bartender/waiter was very nice as I asked for a lemon on the side and straw for my water. We did the Farmers Market with wine pairing which was delicious and exquisite in that it offered different kinds of tastes -savory, sweet, etc. It felt like a vegetarian cleanse but was still delicious. They call it a feast because it feels like one and there are many plates. The bartender/waiter was very attentive and poured water and gave me more lemons (huge plus) because other places I have been to make you wait a while for water when you should get it almost immediately upon seating and others do not bother to refill your glass unless you go out of your way to ask. I would definitely recommend this place. I had a great time here :)",0,0,0,Julie P.,"Farmingdale, NY",7,24,1
4.0,1/25/2014,"Came here for an anniversary dinner with the boyfriend ans was very pleased with almost the entire experience.  I'm a huge fan of tasting menus and being able to try a lot of different dishes and the concept of themed feast was really intriguing so I was excited to come here.  The interior is also very cute and has that rustic feeling.   So the boyfriend and I got the surf and turf feast which totaled about 9 different dishes.. (4 apps, 4 mains and 1 dessert).  I personally enjoyed the apps best especially the fried oyster salad, bisque, and striped bass.  The mains that I loved was the squid ink pasta, scallop and foi gras, the pig ear taco.  Overall all the dishes were delicious.  Though they portion the dishes to two people, it felt like our dinner could have 3-4 so we were so full by our 2nd main but knew we had to power through 2 more and a dessert.I would also  like to call out that their service was amazing that night as well.  There was something hectic going on in the kitchen so it took an abnormal like 30-40 mins between our apps and main dishes.  However the waitress kept updating us on the status and to make up for the long wait all our drinks were removed from the tab.  Definitely appreciated that.I also heard great things about their brunch so would def go back to check that out too.",0,0,0,Eileen J.,"New York, NY",40,185,0
4.0,1/21/2014,"We had such a good brunch here! Only open for a year, the room has a bright, fresh look that still feels cozy hip. We sat at the bar--thank goodness there were a couple open stools because the tables filled up within in minutes of our arriving. If you want to be sure to eat here on Sunday brunch, make a reservation! I like the long community tables and the rustic but still polished decor. The food was very good. The $24 prix fixe comes with a tasty set of starters (you don't even have to order them, they just arrive!). Ours included a plate of 2-bite pastries that were very good, raspberry shooters--delicious--a mini feta and spinach quiche, and a yogurt parfait with granola and pomegranates. Delish. There is one of each for everyone, so you can have these tasty small bites all to yourself. The main courses were the Feast version of croque monsieur, which has a quail egg bird in the hole. The sandwich was a little oily, but hearty and comfortably tasty. Also had a ricotta and spinach omelet, which was the perfect size (I really dislike omelets that are too big and heavy); was light and filled with spinach--I might have liked a more even balance between the ricotta and spinach--but it was good. Nice salad on the side. Cocktails--while they wait for their liquor license--are creative takes on the classics. A beery bloody Mary was bright refreshing. This is a very nice place to land for an enjoyable brunch.

Instead of the egg that typically goes on top of a traditional croque Madame were tiny quail eggs nestled in the bread. Cute but not the same comforting effect as a large oozy egg. Unfortunately the prosciutto was WAY too salty!! I really wanted to like it but couldn't really finish it. Lemon soufflé pancake was good but quite sweet and a bit one dimensional. The wild mushroom omelet was delicious. The smoked salmon dish with beets and quail eggs looked elegant and was quite delicious.

4.0,1/14/2014,"I love the ambiance of this place and the food was good but their name is sort of deceiving! It was hardly a feast! The bakery basket felt like something I could just get from Costco. I did like the pressed juice and they only gave you a shot of it! The yogurt was generic but the salmon tarts, though tiny, were pretty tasty. On the other hand, I did enjoy my main dish a lot! I got the smoked salmon with red flannel hash and quail eggs and it was just a more refreshing way to eat smoked salmon during brunch than your average egg bennies. Although I like the concept of this place and it seems like they put a lot of thought into it, I did not care much for the for share dishes. I would rather pay less for just the main dish. Or rather than trying to stuff us with the bakery basket and yogurt, give us one or two solid/unique for share dishes.",0,0,0,Wendy C.,"Manhattan, NY",195,32,20
2.0,1/9/2014,"I've been meaning to try this place out for a while now, having walked by several times before. Walking in, I was impressed by the decor - very rustic and homey feeling. The place was warm and comfortable, and the waiter was attentive when I walked in. Unfortunately, the experience went downhill after I ordered. I got the sea bass that ended up presenting little value for the price ($32). I found the single piece of ravioli at the bottom of the sea bass to taste doughy, and the garlic sauce that lent taste to the bass and kale a little runny for my taste. I finished the meal in a matter of minutes, so small were the portions. My friend that I came with felt the same way; while the food was decent, the portions were too small and the price was too high. At the end of the day, it could just be my culinary preferences - I tend to be value-conscious and have little patience for the trendy NYC restaurants that feel they can charge a ton because they have a nice ambience and pay sky-high real estate prices. That said, there are better restaurants in the area that have a similar rustic, new American feel. For example, Picnic nearby on 2nd Ave and 6th St. has better portion sizes at better prices.The decor and service were solid, and the atmosphere was inviting and warm. Yet the food left me wanting and disappointed at the lack of value for the price.

5.0,1/4/2014,"Working right across the street from these guys, I have always been tempted to dine in and tonight I finally did. Let me start out by saying that if I were to ever own and decorate my own restaurant, it would look like Feast. This place epitomizes rustic charm and has more character than it knows what to do with. Compliments to the brilliant mind(s) behind the design. Note: not enough space to really accommodate large parties, but respectable choice for a date or to wine and dine with a few friends.The food is just as outstanding. Ordered a la carte with my guest and ended with dessert. The mushroom agnolotti was savory, the acidic tart was balanced out by the almost creamy parmesan emulsion. For dessert we ordered the apple crumble and the crème brûlée. The former was good (apples a little undercooked for my taste), but the latter was brilliant. It comes served in three varieties - jasmine, mint chocolate, and vanilla (my favorite) - and each is rich and sweet without being overbearing.Above all, I give it five stars for the service. Working in the restaurant industry, I know how difficult it can be to deliver consistent, quality service. But these guys, servers and bussers alike, know what they're doing.

4.0,12/30/2013,"With my aunt visiting from out of town, I was on the prowl for a solid brunch spot around Union Square. Many Yelp reviews later, I stumbled upon Feast.Feast is a bright, open air spot with communal seating. The themes here are clearly simplicity, wood and nature, with single light bulbs dangling from a wooden plank ceiling and simple wildflowers adorning the center of each table. Very clean and sharp looking design.Brunch is a set price at $24 a pop, which includes a drink, a trio of shareable appetizers, and entree.My advice, go crazy with the Beery Mary - a Bloody Mary with beer instead of vodka.Croissants, chocolate croissants, muffins, fresh squeezed juice, and a yogurt parfait with fresh fruit and granola kicked off our meal. Everything was delicious, especially the parfait, but the croissants were my favorite here. Their buttery, flaky crust had a perfect crunch to them.The Lemon Soufflé Pancake caught my eye on the menu. It requires a 20-25 minute wait, but it's well worth it. I'd never seen anything like it. Out came an enormous pancake that had risen into a fluffy, sweet brunch treat. It tasted just like a pancake but was extremely light and airy. The mixed berry sauce and powdered sugar it was doused in certainly helped its cause.Scrambled eggs in a pastry shell with mushrooms delivered the savory part of the meal. Served on a crispy bed of spinach, the pastry dough flaked away with each movement of the fork to reveal a scrambled egg-filled interior. Great presentation.The VerdictWhat a meal! I thought the $24/person price tag was a little steep for brunch, but Feast delivered. Every part of the meal was outstanding - from the ambiance to the service to the food. Your $24 includes a lot of food and by the end we were ready to roll out of there.

I wish I had asked for a copy of the wine list -- there are quite a few excellent choices offered by the glass.

Nice.Only suggestion/complaint, and it's minor, and it's really more of an epidemic in the food biz, is the use of sugar and browning (Glycation).  I think browning is an easy-way-out for creating tasty dishes, and what sucks is it's so bad for people, especially anyone sensitive.  The food tasted so amazing that it just didn't need the extra sugar kick it had in some dishes like the Venison.  The acorn squash also was browned and the skin was actually black.  Google it.I get it- we're out, we're festive, chefs want to give us a mini-celebration every time we eat, AND this place isn't sold as a health food joint.  Check.  At the same time, the flavors were rich enough and I don't think they needed the heavy-handedness of the extra browning.  Restraint is a fine line of course and taste couldn't be more subjective.  I just wish people knew the science behind browning foods and ease off of it a hair.On the venison, be specific how you order it- mine had to be tweaked (and done so incredibly courteously).All the salads are amazing by the way.

The pancakes were as described. Light fluffy soufflé with a hint of lemon. It is has a hint of the bitter lemon rind after taste for me though.

Each Feast changes, appropriately, from season to season. There is a Vegetarian friendly Farmer's Market Feast, a seafood centered feast, and a meat spectacular.  Most recently, we enjoyed the Pork Feast.  It is no secret to those who know me that I have a deep love for bacon and pretty much all things pork, but the flavor combinations were among the most amazing porcine tastes I have found.  Highlights include bacon & egg [pork belly, grits, quail egg], pig's ear taco, Berkshire pork Milanese, and chocolate profiterole [w/ bacon brittle sprinkles].Feast has quickly become my favorite spot for special occasions and visitors.

4.0,8/28/2013,"Due to some dietary restrictions, my friends and I decided to get the Farmer's Market tasting. While the entire meal was vegetarian, the food was very satisfying and we didn't miss the meat at all. There are several items in the first and second courses, served family style, giving some excitement over the variety of things we got to try. My favorite of the first course items was the fried zucchini flower stuffed with ricotta and zucchini pesto, served on a thick slice of grilled zucchini and refreshingly light zucchini carpaccio. Amazing crunchy and creamy textures and a great juxtaposition of fresh, smoky and tangy flavors. Other first course items included a chilled grape and almond soup and tomato tarte tatin.The mushroom pasta, stuffed artichokes, and succotash in the second course were equally interesting, combining good textures and flavors.Overall a very good experience.  Can't wait to try the seafood or pork feasts!",3,0,2,Velina L.,"New York, NY",283,558,9
4.0,8/27/2013,"Feast has a pretty solid brunch option: $24 prix-fixe gets you some beverage (coffee or alcoholic), some shared appetizers for the table, and your choice of entree.Feast's dinner format is a multi-course, group dining experience. I've heard that their portions are small (which makes sense since you're getting several courses). ANYWAYS in my mind their kitchen is overflowing with tiny baking sheets and miniature tart pans because the appetizers they brought us were so cute and doll-sized: baby quiches, yogurt parfaits in shot glasses, tiny pain du chocolat. I felt like I was at a children's tea party. For my main I chose the mushroom / scrambled eggs / puff pastry, and he got the lemon ricotta pancakes. My entree was tasty - I had some nice, meaty mushrooms but the puff pastry was a bit overwhelming in how flaky it was, hard to cut through. His ricotta pancakes were great! It was a huge Dutch-style pancake, airy and cake-like, and smothered in a super sweet jam sauce.Service was friendly and brunch at Sunday noon was not the least bit crowded; I think this place is still getting off the ground. Not a bad choice in the Union Square area, and I'd consider visiting this place for dinner as well.",4,1,1,Alice L.,"Manhattan, NY",89,173,0

3.0,8/19/2013,"Now this is a place I'd been dying to try! So when my friend was looking for something fun for her birthday dinner I immediately pounced.  The whole concept is that they have three ""feasts"" to choose from - veggie, meat and seafood.  You HAVE to get at least two of each feast as a group.  So we ordered three veggie and three meat.  The second part of the gimmick is ALL your food comes out at once with each plate holding one bite for each person.  So for example, a steak dish (from the meat feast menu) would have three bite size pieces because three of us did the meat feast. The food was good but nothing was memorable.  I don't know if that's because it just wasn't unique or because everything came out at once so it was hard to keep track of what I liked/disliked.  Overall it was a fun experience but at the end of the day insert ""tasting menu"" for ""feast"" and it's the exact same thing.  The restaurant itself is gorgeous though.  Whoever designed it did a beautiful job.",0,0,1,Laura H.,"Sydney, Australia",412,394,3

Our table got the shellfeast and the food was deeeeliiiicious, varied, and well-portioned for 4 people. My favorites were the razor clam pizza and the mussels with toasted hominy, ohmygoodness! It's a perfect place to go with a group. (My *only* criticism -- they could take their time bringing out certain dishes. They brought out several warm dishes at the same time (scallop, linguini, mussels), so you didn't get to take your time on any one dish because you're worried the other dishes will get cold. But this place is super duper -- I will be back!)",0,0,0,amie b.,"Manhattan, NY",2,84,2
5.0,8/10/2013,"LOVE LOVE LOVE Feast!!! As much as I want to keep this place a hidden gem, I want the restaurant to stay around! I contacted feast about 1.5 months before to reserve a space for a party. They easily accommodated our party of 20 at 8:30 for a Friday night - even after the times and number of people kept changing. The hostesses, management, and chefs were wonderful. They emailed me a proposed Chef's menu to suit some pickier and allergic attendees. They were very receptive to my changes and questions (yes, they even offered to have 20 different bills if it would be easiest to pay at the end). And the menu was unbelievable. The ambiance was great when we walked in. The room was crowded but not too loud. Our group was escorted downstairs where we had our own space (and restroom). Always a plus!With a group of people, there are bound to be dishes some may not like as much as others. At feast, the tastings are served family style (in waves) which is perfect for sharing and eating what you want without feeling like you missed a course or are overpaying for a meal you can't eat completely. Service night-of the party was unsurprisingly perfect. Each dish was described, multiple wine glasses provided, and no crumb was left behind! As for the dishes itself, here is the rundown:Beets with burrata: awesome! Love the endive boats. Oyster escabeche: gorgeous presentation, perfect amount of acid - making for a great bite. Charcuterie: nothing was left! The meats, pâté, hogs head cheese, pickles! Even the mustard was divine. Bacon and egg: awesome. The pork belly and quail egg were perfectly cooked. And the grits were delish!Pork Milanese: perfectly cooked and the blackberry sauce was perfectly tart without being overbearing. Scallop with citrus: the presentation was beautiful! And each one was cooked to perfection. Mushroom agnolotti: love the truffle foam and mushroom taste! As a mushroom lover, this was possibly my favorite (although I can't really decide). But the mushroom flavor is definitely strong.Summer succotash with grit cakes: when this came out, the entire table thought it was the scallops. The grit cakes had that gorgeous sear and tasted even better than it looked. The corn and poblanos was also amazing!! Mascarpone ice cream sundaes with homemade toffee: great presentation and loved being able to personalize the toppings. The caramel sauce was a hit! It was a perfect amount of food for the perfect price. As for the booze, despite no liquor license, the wines were the way to go. Very affordable and a good variety The duck pond pinot Gris and the Malbec were great. Great beer list too! And the cucumber lemonade was so refreshing! For the amount of food, wine, espresso, and private space, we each paid $112 a person after a 20% tip. More than reasonable! I would have paid 2-3x that given my experience!Will definitely be back seasonally to see the varying menus!

She said it reminded her of the places she would go when she lived in Australia.Anyways, we were handed a menu, but it turned out there was a flat fee for a brunch meal. I wasn't that hungry so my friend and I split the meal in two. Kara, who waited on us, was super charming and very patient with us. She and the manager were very accommodating with our requests. All in all we were blown away by the service. And the food was rad. We tried such interesting flavors. The squash blossoms were amazing.

The scallop and the salad with crispy toast were very good. We were served with a prefix menu. They didn't even tell us there is a la cart menu. We would have preferred make our own choices.

4.0,7/29/2013,"If you want a foodie experience, you must definitely come to Feast.I came here for a birthday after a good friend recommended it. It was a bit pricey, but definitely worth every penny. The style of eating here is very unique and different than any other restaurant that I have ever been to - family style but with individual portions. Basically you have 4 different set menus to choose from (all of which include 3 course meals). The difference between these different menus are the prices as well as what kinds of food they feature. Everyone at your table must decide together on which menu you want, and everyone gets the same food. It's very interesting because you have to collaborate and keep an open mind while choosing your dish, especially for those with a very opinionated mind about their food.We all got the Pork Roast feast in which all the dishes featured some kind of pork in the dish. It was absolutely amazing. I never knew pork could be so versatile in creating different flavors and palettes! We also ordered a bottle of wine, which paired perfectly with our meal as well. All of the tables here are long, communal tables and so it was a very comforting experience, almost as if I was reuniting with long lost family members over some delicious food.The only reason I give it a 4 stars is because it is slightly overpriced, but if you're prepared to spend money on some good food, I highly recommend that you go.

The presentation was equally flawless, in fact there was a food photographer working for Feast for a portion of our dinner, and all of the dishes brought for the photos looked the exact same as what we received. So rest assured that whatever you see featured on their website or managers photos on Yelp is what you will be eating! The space itself has clearly been created with a huge amount of love and use unique industrial antiques such as industrial pulleys and lighting fixtures. Of note there is a small al' carte menu- but the bulk of the food is off tasting menus. Don't let that scare you away- these are not frou frou multi hundred dollar tasting menus, but will run you in the 50s-60s per person before wine pairings. It was surprisingly quiet for a Saturday night- like all amazing finds I am torn between wanting it to stay this way so I have an exceptional go to for a New York dinner meant to impress, and wanting to ensure it doesn't stay so quiet that it shuts down.

The food here isn't ""family style"" -- each of the courses come out in portions composed for each of the people at your table. This, of course, didn't prevent me from trying to get some extra of my favorite courses from my boyfriend.Some tips:- There is a gorgeous communal table at the back of the restaurant. This is a great place for groups of 8+ with a direct view of the kitchen.- If you don't have a reservation, there is a bar with about 10 seats. With bar seats that have backs, this is definitely an ok place to sit for a full 'feast.'- The restaurant offers an a la carte menu, but I am confused as to why you would come to a place known for their 'feasts' if you just wanted to pick and choose?- Best plates: filet mignon w/ gnocchi, mushrooms & a fried egg; 'bacon & egg' which is pork belly, grits & a quail egg",4,0,0,Grace L.,"New York, NY",14,69,7
5.0,7/11/2013,"Monday, I had my third visit since Feast's opening in March , and I have been wowed every time. The food is always amazing! The service is friendly, attentive and unpretentious. The decor has a playful sense of humor, comfort and elegance. The low lighting  helps to create a sense of intimacy, while the seating and open kitchen develops a sense of a magical shared experience. It's fun to catch a glimpse of the chef in action and then to see that action transformed into delicious plate after plate presented before you.I also love the fact that once your table makes the decision of which feast to enjoy, you have nothing else to worry about other than the conversation of your table and what very reasonable and refreshing beverage will accompany your courses to come.  Another great thing about Feast is that the menu changes frequently, so there is always something new to try.  What the chef puts on the menu is beautiful, creative and delicious. Every time I've dined here I leave feeling like I just had the best meal of my life.What my table had  that you should have too:Shellfish Feast, and because we are glorious gluttons... several a la carte items.We had beautifully dressed Oysters Escabeche;Crispy , light and adorable Oyster Po Boy Sliders;Creamy and petite Razor Clam Pizza;Seared Scallop with shaved fennel and citrus, perfectly cooked and  humongous btw.Baby Clams with house made linguini,Mussels with fried hominy in white wine with crusty farmers bread, so great ! - mussels were beautiful, bountiful and excellently seasoned.Not to mention the house made bread  with super crisp crust, perfect for sopping up the broth, and also...The Pig's Ear Taco was fascinating, fun, fried,a fantastic new experience for me !Beet and Burrata  with watercress - Loved !BBQ pulled pork on fried green tomato  with a green peppercorn sauce on plate, tasted like a sunny southern summer afternoon, Market  Salad was  zesty and refreshing! We also enjoyed the sweet Tomato Tartar Tartlet and Tempura Asparagus Fronds with an addictive dipping sauce.If that wasn't enough ... to set us over the blissful edge,  we had two desserts the Ice cream filled cream puff drizzled in dark chocolate and topped with crispy bits of bacon which was a decadent and well balanced dessert, I can't stop thinking about it !And the equally amazing  shortbread cookie and mixed seasonal berry compote!",1,0,0,Sarah S.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,28,1

4.0,7/6/2013,"When I first walked in, I was a little grumpy.  I was waiting by the hostess area and it was so dimly lit, I couldn't read my kindle and then a giant multi-legged bug fell from the ceiling/flew and landed on my arm and it was gross.  Then an employee walked by and stepped on my flip flopped foot.  So I was already feeling like this food better be good. However, once we sat down, my somewhat sour mood dissipated.  Feast has a really interesting concept of thematic ""feasts"".  Everyone at the table must order the same feast and it's brought out semi-family style but in smaller, more elegant composed plates (versus the huge platter family style that one typically thinks of).  It's a cute idea and a cute restaurant.  The place resembles a farmhouse kitchen with bric a bric like non functional mirrors, picture frames with nothing in them, exposed brick walls, an old fridge, big wooden tables with stools, etc.  Basically how I might decorate my country's house's kitchen if I ever make enough money to have a country home.  Although now my country house kitchen sounds really creepy. But the overall affect is cute I swear.Now onto the feast itself.  We ordered the shellfeast which utilized a variety of shellfish because we liked that it was more variety than say the pig one which used different parts of the pig but still used the same basic animal.  The shellfish feast had oyster and mussels and clams so it was far more diverse.  Overall, I can pick apart things I would improve about several dishes but some of them I found very enjoyable and generally speaking I thought the idea of the restaurant was very fresh and fun and the portions were fair so that's why I'm going with 4 stars vs 3.  The overall experienced added up to 4 (rounded up from a 3.5) even if many of the dishes themselves were a 3.For a course by course breakdown:Oyster Po'Boy: This was a good oyster po'boy, however, the ratio of bun to oyster overpowered the components of this sandwich.Razor Clam Pizza: Flavors were decent but the pizza dough would have been better if it was crisper/thinner.Oyster Escabeche:Very tasy and fresh and clean, one of my favorites of the night.Charred Romaine: I love the idea of a grilled salad and this was pretty good but some parts of the romaine were charred more to the burned side vs delight char flavor.Mussels with asparagus fries: Loved loved loved the asparagus fries.  I wish fast food restaurant would replace potatoes with baby asparagus fries. I could not get enough of these fries.  The mussels were disappointing though to one of my dining companions.  She thought they were too small and too many didn't open.  That bothered me less than the fact that the flavor was not very interesting.  It had some heat from the chiles but frankly just a classic white wine, garlic, parsley would have been tastier.Seared sea scallop: Massive scallop in the shell.  Beautiful presentation.  Scallop was perfectly cooked although it needed seasoning/salt.  The fennel and citrus did a disservice to the perfectly cooked oyster.Linguini with clams: Homemade pasta was wonderful with the clams.Sautéed spinach with garlic: Very garlicy and tasty.Pound cake with citrus sabayon: Pound cake slice should be thicker and frankly the candied lime zest reminded me of fruitcake in not a good way.  I would recommend more pound cake with just the sabayon going forward.",1,0,0,Lisa W.,"Hoboken, NJ",141,211,0

They offer four tasting menus: vegetarian (yay), shell, pork, and recently added the chef's tasting which is a few items from each.They rely on candles for lighting, since it was impossible for pictures. Wood notes all around, kitschy décor. Tables are long communal dining hall tables, ensuring you will be mingling and passing plates up and down. Service was attentive and never missed an empty water or wine glass. The basement, where we got seated is roomy and cool (a luxury in NYC). We got the meat feast, for the 9 of us. Very rarely, when there are a few good dishes, is there enough to go around. This isn't the case at Feast. Although all the dishes were delicious, there were plentiful portions to go around. They didn't hold back on the pate which I loved. Some notable dishes: stuffed squash blossomBlossom stuffed with pulled pork, battered, fried. pig ear saladsome fruit, some arugula, and a crispy pig ear.potato gnocchiwhat's so special about gnocci? well, they will be the softest moistest gnocchi you've ever tasted.chocolate profiteroletopped with bacon bits! Meat to finish, of course.We didn't enjoy the root beer pork so much, as none of us were root beer fans. NYC has a 90% failure rate for new restaurants. Feast has got my bet to be in the 10%.

So the setting of the restaurant features long tables/joint tables. You may even rub elbows with people you don't know.Anyway, came here with a party of 6. We were there really early on a Friday, 6pm so it wasn't packed at all. It does get very crowded by around 8pm that they had to start turning away people.So on to the food. We were able to sample everything. The menu changes based on what's in season. But this is great because you're always guaranteed to try something new and fresh.  The menu is also broken up into tastings - so if you're a seafood lover, a lot of dishes will feature in-season fish, shellfish, etc.Here is what we were able to sample (we got extras on top of the prix fixe):Beet ravioli - goat cheese, olive crumble, orange -- Not a fan of beets but I love this combo. It's so delicate. Slices of beet envelope the olive crumble and goat cheese. LOVE this.Leek Tart - smoked shitake, frisee -- So comforting. It's salty and ""meaty"" from the mushroom and then the pastry is so light and buttery. My favorite item on the menu.Carrot Risotto - asparagus, crispy poached egg -- Perfectly poached egg but didn't like this dish only because I'm a carrot hater.Stuffed Artichoke - tabouleh salad -- Nothing too specialScallop sliders - celery relish, pickled mustard sea -- I didn't eat thisStuffed squash blossom - bbq pulled pork -- Ok this is SO interesting. It's a squash blossom (looks like a flower) and the inside is stuffed with BBQ pork. They fry the flower (blossom) portion. SO good!Crispy pig ears - arugula, blackberry -- Yum, who would've thought this combo would be tasty. The salty pig ears, bitter/peppery arugula and sweet blackberry just played together very well.Bacon and egg - pork belly, grits, quail egg -- I really loved the quail egg and the pork belly, but I felt like it needed a little more oopmh. Also this sits on top of a pastry tart.House charcuterie, pickles, cognac mustard -- Pickled charcuterie board of carrots, radish, beets, onionsBerkshire pork tenderloin - root beer glazed apples -- Tender and very unique taste because of the root beer. I wouldn't say I liked it but it was interesting to taste. Not usually a fan of sweet and savory flavors.Potato gnocchi - mangalitsa ham, broccoli rabe -- Really enjoyed the gnocchi. So fresh and light.Stuffed cabbage - trotter fried rice -- Nothing special, least favoriteMushroom and green beans -- Very fresh green beans and the mushroom.. not sure what kind it is but so deliciousDESSERTS (disclosure: not a desserts/sweets person AT ALL)chocolate profiterole - bacon brittle -- VERY interesting. I actually liked this. I'm not chef so I'll break this down in layman terms. Chocolate brownie/cake type thing, vanilla ice cream, chocolate fudge and sprinkles of fried (?) bacon. So tasty. I was shocked at the dance it did in my mouth.Beignets - truffle, caramel, jam sauces on the side -- Ate the beignets by itself, again, do not like sweets and it's very light, and crispy.Buttermilk panna cotta - summer berries chambord -- Too sweet for me. It was because of the berry mixture. Kind of like jam with berries on top of custard.",1,0,0,Sophia S.,"Brooklyn, NY",23,142,22
4.0,6/19/2013,"This restaurant is legit! They offer three tasting/feast menus: vegetarian, seafood, and pork, in addition to ""a la carte"" options. Everyone in your party must order the same feast. I really like this concept as it simplifies the ordering process. Plus everyone gets a good portion of each dish. My wife and I selected the pork feast, which was out of control amazing. Every single thing we ate was delicious. In particular, I enjoyed the stuffed squash blossom filled with BBQ pulled pork, the crispy pig's ear salad, and the bacon & egg (pork belly, grits, and quail egg). Damn good! The berkshire pork tenderloin must have been sprinkled with crack. We also ordered oysters as an appetizer, which were perfect. We went here on a rainy Tuesday night and every seat was taken. I really don't want to see how packed this place gets on the weekend. Regardless...two thumbs up to Feast. Keep it up!",0,0,1,Mark L.,"Manhattan, NY",24,13,33
5.0,6/14/2013,AMAZING EVERY TIME!A wonderful concept. My favorite restaurant in NYC when dining with friends. I highly recommend the Chefs Feast.

4.0,6/13/2013,"The fun, adventurous aspect of communal eating is captured perfectly at Feast, a restaurant in the East Village that opened earlier this year. Except this is a potluck thrown by some of your most stylish and interesting friends who all happen to be amazing cooks. Feast has carefully curated three different tasting options (vegetarian, scallops or pork) so that you can have a dinner party that fits the mood you're in. The one thing to note is that everyone must participate in the same feast, no mixing and matching allowed. So choose your dinner companions wisely (meat lover + vegetarian = disaster), or learn to be a good friend and compromise! Luckily my friend Cat was up for anything and has a great palate, so we were both on the same page and opted for the vegetarian farmer's market feast. I chose this option because I think a successful vegetable dish is a true test of a restaurant's skill. Feast was able to pull off this amazing feat of preparing vegetables in unexpected ways many times over. I was most impressed by those dishes that drew out flavors not typically associated with vegetables, like the leek tart, the pea falafel in the trio of pea tastes, and the stuffed artichoke.. Eating the leek tart was truly a mind-trip. It looked and tasted like a bacon-flavored quiche, but there was absolutely no meat in it. The fava bean agnolotti, while not the most innovative dish technique-wise, was my personal favorite. The pea soup was also more traditional, but I was struck by how much of the pea's natural sweetness really came through in the broth. The fried vegetables were a hit-or-miss, depending on how crisp or soggy they were. Not every innovative pairing of vegetables was entirely successful. The burrata and beet felt a little incomplete, as did the carrot risotto, although the crispy poached egg on its own was pretty impressive. And I would have preferred if the kale salad had retained its crispy texture--steaming the leaves made it seem too much like Popeye's spinach.Our veggie feast ended on a high note with the strawberry rhubarb shortcake. Sometimes shortbread can be really dense like a biscuit, but the shortbread in this dish was light and airy. The strawberry and rhubarb glaze was excellent, and the vanilla whipped cream held everything together very nicely.What made this dinner at Feast stand out was my recollection of how excited I was during the whole meal. Everything about that dinner was such a sensory pleasure, both visually with all the beautiful interior rustic fixtures and mason jar table settings and gustatorily with the inventive and memorable dishes. I truly enjoyed being a guest at this East village dinner party, here's to hoping that I get invited back for a second and third round!",1,0,0,Sherry J.,"Manhattan, NY",82,35,23

4.0,6/5/2013,"So I left a bit perplexed about their whole tasting menu concept and if they could tweak it a little I would love this place. They offer 3 different 'feasts' a vegetarian, a seafood and a meat. They all sounded scrumptious but they're very restricting on how you can experience them. Everyone in the party has to have the same menu and you can't  share 1 tasting amongst 2 people? Well when I go to a restaurant I like to try a bunch of different things so I always make sure that I don't order the same thing that everyone else at the table gets. You better go to this place with people that all have the same taste as you or you're shit out of luck. If you don't want one of the tastings the a la carte menu is very limited and none of what's on the tastings can be ordered a la carte, quite a conundrum. My friend wanted the scallop tasting , I love seafood but scallops are my least favorite. I wanted the vegetarian, she said no...see where I'm going with this? The very sweet bartender explained that this was the way it was because the kitchen has limited space. The restaurant is small and cute and I get that but then don't offer the tastings. We sat at the bar and ordered a bottle of the Malbec which was more than decent for the price. We were forced to then only order off the very limited a la carte menu. We started with the spring pea salad and it was delish! Spring peas, sliced radishes, pea tendrils and  some falafel dressed in a creamy but light dressing. The portion size was large and perfect to share. For entrees we went with the sliced pork loin with mango salsa and the scallops. The pork was perfectly pink on the inside and crispy on the out. All of the plates are beautifully presented. The scallops were served on a bed of polenta with some sauteed kale and I loved them even though I'm not a huge fan of scallops. The food is really good at this spot I just wish they were a bit more flexible with their menu.",2,0,0,Leslie S.,"Los Angeles, CA",82,444,2

We had the 'Farmer's Market Feast' that came with a strawberry rhubarb shortcake, which was fantastic. (I would come back just to eat the desserts here!).It is a little bit difficult to dine here if the members at the table want to eat different things (e.g. someone likes lamb & someone is vegetarian) because the whole table is served the same tasting menu. But, you can also order additional dishes on the side to accommodate people's food preferences. Overall, I had a great time, and I would definitely go back!",1,1,0,Michelle C.,"Irvine, CA",240,14,0
5.0,6/3/2013,"I rarely ever write reviews but I think Feast deserves one. I went in the second weekend they were open for Brunch. I ordered the merguez stew, my friend ordered the croque-madame. The menu is simple, but I like that. Many other restaurants have an overly complicated, pretentious menu without execution. Others have menus that are overly bland with the same generic menu (eggs benedict, omelettes with nova, eggs florentine, etc) and are good but not great.Feast deserves 5 stars from me simply because the food was delicious, it was simple but not boring, and you could see the attention to detail in the execution of each and every item ordered from the small split pea shooter to the main dish.",0,0,0,Joji S.,"Manhattan, NY",47,8,4
5.0,6/2/2013,"Outstanding in every way! Our brunch experience at Feast was worth the trip. First of all, the decor and atmosphere is great. Every detail and design is very well thought out. The service is close to perfect and attentive. We had the Steak n Egg and Crab & Artichoke Benedict. Both dishes were interesting and prepared well. The croissants, muffin, pea and tomato soup, and quiche are all great warm ups for the main course. They know how to make a cup of coffee here! It was 11am on Sunday, so I did not have a beer. I mention this because they have a nice beer list with Founders All Day IPA, Keegan's Mothers Milk Stout, and a great Belgian beer that caught my eye. From the lighting to the business cards to the soap in the bathroom, Feast is great in every way. We will be back  soon to enjoy dinner and beers.",0,0,0,Mike M.,"Manhattan, NY",9,45,9
5.0,5/20/2013,"Dear Feast: You are really freaking fantastic and I'm glad I got to come.  The menu is seasonal, and you can order a la carte but part of the experience is getting the set meal for everyone to share.  The party I came with got the nose-to-tail lamb menu.  Dishes came in three courses, with two of the courses being 4 dishes, and the last course, dessert (Pear Galette with a most delightful bourbon cream).  My favrorites would have to be:- their take on a sheperd's pie.  It's a tart filled with sweet potato puree topped with a generous chunk of mouthwatering lamb belly and mint pesto-rack of lamb.  The meat seriously just fell off the bone, and was cooked perfectly. -carpaccio.  slivers of apple wrapped in lamb with cognac mustard and almonds.  Simple, but the flavors went together great.What I didn't love was the ""Lambsagna"".  Presentation was great- it's lamb shank wrapped with a slab of pasta, with goat cheese, broccoli rabe, and preserved lemon.  It was still good, don't get me wrong, but I felt like the lamb shank could've had more flavor.  I don't usually drink soda, but felt compelled to try the orange fennel flavor. Fennel is subtle, more like an aftertaste; pretty good. They also have a good list of beer and wine.  We were so full when we finished...my god.  It's pricey, but definitely worth the experience and it's a lot of fun just to eat family style and chat for a good three hours.  Service is very friendly, they introduce all the dishes when they bring them to the table, and you don't feel rushed at all.",3,1,2,Yifen J.,"Kyoto, Japan",320,363,167
5.0,5/16/2013,"Conceptually, Feast is about the meal and not hodge podge ordering (even though you can order a la carte).  I loved the choice between the 3 prix fixe meals (which they call appropriately ""feasts"") and everything was delicious (we ordered the scallop dinner ). DISCLAIMER: Note that Feast serves their menu based on the season.  By the time this review is read, they may have changed menus. Some notes on the things i ate:- Definitely get the BEET RAVIOLI. Great re-interpretation of the Beet and Goat cheese salad.- In their scallop dinner tasting menu, there was a Pork belly and Scallop dish.  While i admit the pairing was a little weird (and actually i probably wouldnt pair the two in a dish) the quality of the pork belly was amazing as was the scallop.  It was a reflection of the quality of cooking in their kitchen.General  notes:-The caliber of the presentation was fantastic.The taste of the food was top notch.The ambience was fantastic.The service was wonderful.Definitely make reservations beforehand.And if you're not looking to break the bank for an awesome prix fixe, Feast is the place to go to.",2,1,1,Jon H.,"New York, NY",75,45,6
4.0,5/7/2013,"Very confused by the other reviewers who said they left hungry. I left pleasantly content, not overly full. In terms of other restaurants that offer a tasting menu, Feast is actually quite reasonable. I was under the impression before I went that the entire party did NOT need to choose the same ""feast,"" but everyone does need to select the same type. I don't eat meat, but my boyfriend does. I do eat seafood, so luckily they began serving the scallop feast. Otherwise he would have had to accommodate me with the vegetarian version, and I don't know if that's any carnivores idea of a way to spend $50 on dinner. The scallop feast was delicious! I hate celery, so I was a bit worried about the fact that it was in the feast twice. I could not taste it one bit the scallop slider--seriously, why has no one thought of a scallop slider before? And the celery root three ways was actually delicious! I had the celery root pot pie before at Fat Radish and I thought the taste of celery was overwhelming. This dish at Feast gave me a new perspective on the root. I thought each dish that came out was great. Nothing completely blew me away, but it was all consistent, delicious, and timely. They bring food out in two acts, which means four dishes at a time. This can be a bit overwhelming, but since each dish is only a few bites, it keeps things moving.For almost $50/pp, I though the scallop feast was actually a good deal. I had quite a few whole scallops in my dishes, as well as mixed in with other things. For the money, since the vegetarian feast is only a few less, if you do eat fish I would probably go for the scallop feast.Agree with others who said the wine menu was limited. It's also pricey for those who are just ordering by the glass. Two glasses of cab ran me $30. I would recommend getting a bottle of wine if you plan on having more than two glass (though this should be a general rule of thumb when eating out). Draft beers were reasonable and they had an interesting selection.Does feel a bit out of place in the neighborhood because of the Freeman's feel inside, but I think that's just the trend these new age restaurants are adapting.

4.0,4/26/2013,"Solid new restaurant in an area that's pretty lacking in great restaurants. I really like the concept of Feast - family style dining that's customized to the size of your party. It's pretty ingenious really, a tasting menu of sorts, only much more approachable and communal. They currently offer 3 different feast menus: a vegetarian farmer's market feast, scallop feast, and nose to tail lamb feast. All of the three prix fixe menus are fairly priced, ranging from exactly $38-50 per person. The bf and I ordered their scallop feast, portioned for two, and basically let the kitchen work their magic. To start, the housemade crusty bread was surprisingly very good and still warm when it arrived at our table. I liked the hint of sourdough starter and whole wheat flour in the bread. **SCALLOP FEAST**First courses: - Scallop slider: first time I've ever had a scallop slider, though I'm not sure why more chefs do not do it. The nicely seared scallop was well-seasoned with a nice celery relish that added just enough crunch and brightness.- Ceviche: fresh and pretty fruity with zesty citrus flavor. The presentation was also nice as the ceviche was served in beautiful half shells.- Fried bay scallop: tender and nicely fried with a light breading, although the saffron mayo wasn't very prominent.- Beet ravioli: the ""ravioli skin"" was basically thinly sliced beets, mellowed out with goat cheese and some olive oil and citrus - an interesting take on a beet salad.Main courses:- Seared sea scallop: the addition of braised pork belly and rhubarb was definitely innovative and worked surprisingly well. I'd take this over your typical surf & turf any day.- Pot pie: Probably one of the most impressive plates of the night, in my opinion, and I'm not even a big fan of pot pie. The smoked scallop and razor clam chowder encased in light puff pastry was downright ethereal and comforting. It's also great that they leave the scallops in large chunks.- Charred asparagus: the red wine vinaigrette was not extraordinary but I can never say no to fresh asparagus.- Celery root 3 ways: another simple yet one of the more impressive bites we had - loved the puree and roasted parsnips atop a big and crispy parsnip chip. It was a perfect balance of sweet, savory, nutty, and creamy.Dessert: Vanilla yoghurt panna cotta with mango and little ginger shortbread cookies. The panna cotta was a nice texture and pretty light, though certainly not the best panna cotta I've had.My only gripe would be that their wine list is pretty limited and not the most well-curated. The only Sauvignon Blanc on their menu I had was mediocre and quite bland. The metal stools around the larger communal tables in the back are also a little uncomfortable to sit in, unfortunately.I think Feast is a fun place, possibly with a large party as the whole experience of ordering one of their prix fixe ""feasts"" allows for easy sharing and interactivity. Of course they also have an a la carte menu which you can order off of. But why do that when you can have 6-7 dishes for a real feast?",3,1,1,Cecilia Z.,"Los Angeles, CA",762,644,43
2.0,4/24/2013,"Its been a while since I had dinner and then needed a second dinner a short time later.  Not really what I was expecting from a place called Feast.  Anyway, this is the deal -- they have set tasting menus which they strongly strongly encourage (and an uninspired a la carte menu).  Everyone in your party has to order the same tasting menu (we tried asking).  The ""Feast"" aspect is that they bring out 3-4 dishes out at the same time so it seems like a ""feast"".  But each plate has roughly one ""item"" on it per person.  For 2 people with a glass of wine each, came out to about $150 total.  A bit out of place for the hood if you ask me.The food is tasty and indicative of some careful thought (the beet-goat cheese dumpling was particularly attractive), yet otherwise lacking in real depth.  The restaurant inside is nice, but generally felt a bit wanting.  Oh, and when you make a reservation make sure you specify you want a stand-alone table, otherwise they'll seat you at a communal table in the front or back which really kills the mood.  Sorry but I dont enjoy brushing elbows and rolling the dice on the communal table neighbor lottery for the price this place demands.  Hard not to be a judgmental judy in such proximity.  I would also suggest earlier dinner times as I can imagine the street becomes a bit of a zoo once the sun goes down and the weather gets nice given the bars in the immediate vicinity.  Unless you like to end the night with a jagerbomb.  Next.",3,0,0,Hhhoya W.,"New York, NY",9,94,0

It wasn't until we sat down and were given menus that we realized the shtick of this place: multi-course tasting menus are mandatory, except for a severely limited a la carte menu. When we asked the waiter if we could please just order a few dishes, he told us with a decidedly haughty sniff, ""I'm sorry but that's not our concept.""

4.0,4/1/2013,"I walked by Feast on the way to another restaurant one day, and was immediately drawn to their signage, because it reminded me of the type of restaurant I would see back home in San Francisco. By the end of the night, my assumptions were confirmed.It was a Saturday evening, so I booked a reservation online for 30n mins later at 7:30n just in case. Upon arrival, we were immediately seated. However, less than five minutes later a very apologetic hostess asked us to move to a different table because she sat us at the wrong one initially. As long as I'm not giving up a table with a view I could care less, so I obliged, but my friend  I came with was a little less forgiving. We were moved to a community table instead, and offered two glasses of complimentary champagne for the trouble. It wasn't that serious of an issue for me to begin with, so cheers b*tches!The concept behind Feast, like many ""hipster-ish"" places back home, is shared meals. That weekend, they had a special ""Feaster"" menu, but we still opted to order a'la carte. Because ... well, we're fat-asses and don't want to share. The homie ordered the ""steak and eggs,"" while I  opted for the ""lamb shank lasagna"" per the waitresses suggestion, and started off with raw oysters.HOLY SH*T.The oysters were delicious enough to eat without hot sauce. His ox tail was so tender it melted in my mouth, and the crispy shell that surrounded the hard-boiled eggs killed me softly. I could've eaten 5 more of those and called it a night. My lasagna was just as good, which says a lot because I can only eat so much lamb before I start to hear crying sheep in the back of my head, but I finished it with a look of defeat on my face. The portions look small, but are satisfying. Since the meal was going so well, we decided to get dessert after seeing the people next to us order bread pudding. The bread pudding comes with a little flask of milk you can pour over (so unnecessary, but definitely one of the reasons we ordered it lol), and because the waiters seemed to think they gave us horrible service, we got complimentary beignets with the best dipping sauces I've had in a while. Chocolate, raspberry, and my personal favorite - the coffee caramel. My friend thanked me for being patient, and nice enough to move. Just goes to show you what a little understanding and patience can get you. I will definitely be coming back to get my Feast on.

5.0,3/25/2013,"My second time dining here within two weeks! It is by far my new favorite restaurant. So unexpected, but so incredibly delicious! Words can not explain how tasty everything is!Both times my dining friends have loved this place. I took two separate groups here and we all had the vegetarian feast. I can't have the meat feast because I am allergic to lamb, but thats perfectly fine with me because I'm pretty much 90 percent vegetarian now. The vegetarian feast is so perfectly executed. You really don't realize how much you are getting, but a feast WILL FILL YOU UP! First courses: a baby vegetable garden of root vegetables in a shot glass. You pick it up with your fingers and eat the whole thing. It was so fresh I felt like I was picking it from the garden in my backyard. Then there was the beet frites - a little sweet with a tangy orange cream dipping sauce. Smoked goat cheese tarts - this one was one of my favorites. Fresh pastry shell baked fresh filled with deliciousness! Second courses: Crescent molded shaped spagetti squash with a tomato mushroom tartare or (bolognese) Stuffed fried eggplant with risotto and broccoli rabe, kabocha squash slices with brown butter and ginger snap crumbles, roasted cauliflower with puree.Dessert: THE BEST APPLE CRUMBLE IN NYC! Baked with loads of flavor, reminded me of the Entenmann's bakery crumble, but WAY healthier and HOMEMADE with a lime creme fraiche. OMG... I could get so fat eating this everyday.Some off the feast things we had was the halibut with eggplant, which was delicious. The BBQ shrimp and grits tart - Probably my least favorite, but it was a pretty presentation and very different. Homemade sodas - ROOT BEER is a MUST. The strawberry thyme soda was good too, and not sugary like most homemade sodas.SERVICE is amazing. The owners are actually WORKING... they do everything! It was nice to see a change and not owners just telling their staff what to do. I hope to come back soon and bring my boyfriend to try this place. They also plan on expanding very soon, they will have a lower level dining area!!!Beer and wine only. Thats all they need, and they are already super busy.

4.0,3/25/2013,"Tried out this place on Saturday night. We ordered two small plates (beet ravioli and market salad), then I had the chicken 'n dumplings and he had the halibut. The small plates were tasty and looked gorgeous, as was the chicken entree. Even though the portions didn't look big, I was happily full by the end. The service was prompt (but not rushed) and friendly; our waitress helped us order the right amount of food. I'd like to go back and try a feast, though the ladies next to us had mixed reviews of the lamb feast.",1,1,0,Rachel C.,"Los Angeles, CA",25,203,2
5.0,3/24/2013,"We loved Feast so much the first time around we had to come back for the Nose to Tail menu, which features lamb. This second visit did not disappoint! The chef showcases the versatility of lamb so well in his different preparations, so if you're afraid of lamb (the gamey, overcooked type from your Grandma's Easter dinner), fear not! We're so excited Feast is in the neighborhood and cannot wait to see how the menu evolves in the summer and fall. Run down of the night... We spent some time waiting at the bar since members our party was running a bit late, and chatted with the bartender & the owner (both awesome!). We really enjoyed the IPA on tap, very well balanced, and the stout (Mother's Milk) was very creamy. On the first part of the menu, we really loved the...Merguez Stew: the spice and the creaminess of the quail eggs blended together so well! Shepherd's Pie: the pie crust was awesome, and the sweet potato puree was delicious. And you cannot go wrong with pork belly! Of the second part, we loved...EVERYTHING! We really liked how the lamb chops were seasoned by an herb crust with a kick (wasabi?) and it was complemented by the amazing vegetables and the potato gratin. I was sad I had to share this second part with my friends, it was that good. Dessert was awesome, and our favorite part was the 'drunken' bourbon whipped cream!

2.0,3/24/2013,"What is with all the hype?! Based on reviews I read here, I expected delicious food to blow my socks off. (Maybe that's what happened to the rude diner who hogged our reserved table for 30 full minutes after paying the check, with his giant sockless foot protruding about 4 feet into the main walkway. This is the crowd you can expect.) My girlfriend and I waited for over a half hour at the bar, ordering 4 drinks (necessary) while we waited for the sockless wonder to leave. At one point the hostess came over and apologized, and told us that our table had long finished eating and had paid the check, but they didn't want to make anyone feel rushed. Okay, fine, but at the very least comp us a drink or something. Instead, at the very end of the meal our server apologized again for the wait and brought us a cupcake, on top of the giant apple crisp dessert that came with our meal. It was nice enough, but just... weird. Our wait rage had long since simmered, our moods were already soured throughout the meal, and by the time the complimentary cupcake arrived, the Make Us Happy So We Don't Write a Crappy Yelp Review ship had sailed.Even had the overall experience not been dampened by the above annoying situation, the dinner still wasn't that great. We ordered the Farmer's Market feast, and nothing was really baaaad, it just wasn't that good either. Actually, the risotto stuffed eggplant was bad, with the fried eggplant being inedibly disgusting. The baby vegetable garden was weird, too. It arrived in a long skinny glass tube that made us both wonder how the hell we were supposed to eat it. STOP TRYING TO IMPRESS WITH YOUR FANCY FOOD VESSELS. JUST GIVE US TASTY FOOD. Then the coffee that I ordered with dinner came out several minutes after the dessert was finished and the plates taken away with some lame excuse about the French press requiring time, or something. Ugh. FIGURE IT OUT. MAKE IT WORK. The rest of the food was good, but nothing worth mentioning. It was fine, but way below what we were expecting, which probably made it seem crappier. The food wasn't expensive, which I guess is the best thing you can say about it, but considering what it tasted like and the irritating experience you have to go through to eat it, it shouldn't be.",1,3,1,Sebastian l.,"Manhattan, NY",3,31,0
4.0,3/23/2013,"You come here for a feast, and a feast is what we had- 9 courses for $38 (all vegetarian) - there is a lamb option for $48, don't cry!I attended Feast this week with a really close friend of mine and had a good meal.  Some really tasty options include: beet frittes, goat cheese and mushroom tart, squash ravioli in a butter cream sauce (to die for), apple crumb with lemon cream on the side, and more options. I'd love to go again.  Our choice of a white pinot grigio wine was also great.  The service here was nice and prompt, I do wish a little more of a personal touch could come with the place.  I liked the bartender's attitude - I walked in telling my friend about some career thoughts and he was encouraging a celebration - very friendly there!  Overall, a nice place for a date or with your friends.  Big communal table in the back.  I liked their bathroom too - odd, I know, but it made me feel really spa like for some reason.There is no door it seems to the kitchen so you can sneak a peak in there too!",1,0,0,Namrata A.,"New York, NY",289,711,24
5.0,3/22/2013,"Had a positively lovely time here!Food was delicious (we did the lamb feast for our table), drinks were tasty (I tried the orange fennel soda--refreshing, good for the stomach, and not overly sweet!), and the service was great (I love, love, love that we were not rushed through and we had a nice pause before the mains were brought out).It also helps that the ambiance is so cozy and pretty and warm and inviting. Loved the candles, the small vases on each table, the wooden details throughout and the ridiculously gorgeous light fixtures. We really had a great experience and will definitely be back to try the seasonal meat menus (and the vegetarian one as well!).(Ooo: the one suggestion I have is that the restaurant accomodate gluten-free palates, especially since the feasts only come with one dessert option, which is usually where gluten hangs out. I didn't ask for an option that I could eat--which I certainly should have--but would be great if there was a notation on the menu about this to make it less awkward for those of us who don't want to be ""that "" person in a group ;) ).",3,0,0,Vespa R.,"Stockholm, Sweden",12,113,12
5.0,3/21/2013,"Came here with a couple of other ladies for a much needed night out.To start, I had the homemade root beer on tap, which was delicious! Was there actually root beer? It's unclear! It was listed under the beers on tap section, but there was no taste of beer, which, as someone that was famished and ready for a feast, I appreciated ;)We ordered the nose to tail feast (and tried to get the goat cheese tarte a la carte, to no avail, womp), which was incredible! All of the appetizers were cooked to perfection. There was a perfect balance of flavors that just exploded in your mouth. I particularly enjoyed the ""shepherd's pie,"" which I recommend just eating in one bite to get the full picture of how delicious it is. The entrees were also quite delicious, though by that point, I was pretty much full (which was an awesome feeling...how often do you get to eat top quality food and be full?). The lasagna had an interesting but delicious texture, though it was slightly on the lukewarm side for my liking, but it was still top notch. The dessert basically stole the show, and therefore deserves its own paragraph. Pear galette, maple walnuts and bourbon cream. So freakin' awesome. It's not a surprise, considering one of the owners comes from a family that has its own bakery. We concluded that pear is underrated and pairs so perfectly with the bourbon cream, which in isolation, is a bit strong. P.S. the decor is amazing and the soap in the bathroom is minty and fragrant (the scent of the soap could be a deal breaker, and therefore is worth mentioning). also the service was great and the waiter definitely was a champ and was totally cool, though he walked in at most inopportune moments and had to deal with our ridiculousness.",2,0,0,Angela S.,"Manhattan, NY",14,34,0
5.0,3/21/2013,"This is my new favorite restaurant in New York.We walked in and were greeted by the most cheerful and friendly host, which is a rarity at new good restaurants. Then we were offered free baked goods from their breakfast business while we waited for our table. The whole restaurant is breathtakingly beautiful and rustic, with farm tables and dimmed lighting and great vintage decor throughout. We had read about the two feast options so were dead set on that, although the a la carte menu looked delicious as well. We tried the Nose to Tail lamb feast and were blown away by each of the 9 exquisite plates brought out, including the scrumptious dessert with homemade whipped cream. This couldn't have been a more wonderful experience. I love this restaurant!",4,0,1,Elena F.,"San Francisco, CA",3,35,2
5.0,3/20/2013,"Good lord this place was good. You have 3 options:1. Order individual plates- BORING2. Famers market prefix(vegetarian)- COOL! $38/person3. Nose to tail(meat)- (haven't tried it bc gf is vegetarian, but I assume just as COOL!) $48/personI'm sure the individual plates are great, but cmon look at the name of this restaurant. if you come here, come to eat! All members of the party is required to have the prefix menu, but usually the whole table has to decide a single prefix  for the whole table. We came hungry and left FULL!the menu changes every month, so thats cool. So, we had the farmers market prefix(which was vegetarian), and as a meat eater, it was just so fantastic.   -presentation: amazing, the food was just so beautiful..reminded me of EMP in some ways.   -taste- every dish had a lot of flavor  -decor-I just remember wood and light bulbs, but the atmosphere was really laid back, which allowed us to enjoy the food more.  -service- really good service. staff was super attentive. I think this restaurant will be around for a long time. Everyone is just so nice and its just so affordable for the quality of food they are putting out. would I go back? duh",1,0,1,Anthony V.,"Manhattan, NY",192,145,161
5.0,3/19/2013,"Great little spot in the East Village. I went with 4 friends of mine last night.  After looking at the menu I was a-little skeptical; however the place was busy on a Snowy Monday night so we decided to give it a shot. We all ordered the Lamb Feast. It consisted of various appetizers and entrees that all went together with the Lamb. I was honestly blown away. The food was really fresh, and the service was excellent. I wouldn't be surprised if the NY Times finds out about this hidden gem and gives it a positive review. I have eaten in a-lot of places in the east village and this is my new favorite. I would highly recommend Feast and would encourage you to probably make a reservation since it got that much business on a Monday night.",4,1,1,Gino C.,"New York, NY",358,4,2

5.0,3/13/2013,"came here for a feast and was not disappointed!  first came the drinks, theyve got a great selection of beers and an awesome root beer on tap that was off the chain.  next came a couple of apps we ordered.  oysters are a must to whet your appetite.  the chicken liver on a waffle from the 'toast' app was transcendental.  super velvety and seasoned perfectly.after the apps came the bevy of plates in the market feast we ordered.  all the dishes were great, i esp liked the stuffed eggplant and spaghetti squash.  we also ordered the STEAK AND EGGS entree as a complement to our market feast which was awesome.  this is the must order if u go.  the oxtail was uber tender and the eggs gave the dish a balanced richness.what put this place at 5 stars for me is the service and ambiance.  i can best describe it as a chill dinner at your friends house where his/her mom is a top chef and (s)he continually tries to stuff you with delicious food until you feel like you're going to burst but you cant stop.  my best advice is to come to this place hungry and often.  ill be back to try the other tasting options soon.  see u there.",3,1,0,Lawrence C.,"Queens, NY",0,72,0
5.0,3/13/2013,"Booked right away when I saw the artice on Gothamist that it was opening. Really cool ambiance with great old fashioned/low lighting, rustic tables/bar area, and a huge communal table in the back.They have two pre-fixe menus, one vegetarian, one meat (nose to tail), both seasonal.  eatfeastnyc.com/menu/fea…Honestly, we had a hard time deciding between the two despite that none of us were vegetarians. We went with the nose-to-tail lamb pre-fixe and couldn't have been happier. Each course was so so good and very creative. The lamb shank, goat cheese & preserved lemon 'lasagna' was our favorite, with the lemon giving it an unexpected touch that made me save it for last. The bartender was super friendly, offering me a taste of the wine before I ordered, and the waitress was very nice - the perfect amount of attentiveness, letting us linger after we finished, not pushing us out the door. I'll definitely be back, not only to try the vegetarian menu, but to try the next seasonal offerings.",3,1,1,Kat F.,"Reston, VA",7,6,1
4.0,3/11/2013,"I'm def coming back! Mi hermana took me here for a belated birthday dinner on Monday (we had a reservation for 7pm). Great atmosphere with the cozy decor, pretty lights, and chill background music. Feast seems like a perfect low-key dinner place for both groups and pairs. Plus, the owner Brian is really cool and he also owns Savoy Bakery! Hope that encourages ppl to come by Feast for their fresh pastries from 8AM-4PM. The ""feast"" idea, which the servers explain as they hand out menus, sounds awesome since my friends and I looove to share our food, but since it was just the two of us we decided to order separate entrees:- Oxtail steak and egg: rich, silky, flavorful (the egg on the side looks like a baked potato but it's super yummy)- Smoked salmon with apple fennel slaw: a lil bland, tender (the bed of wild risotto underneath gave a nice pop of flavor) The portions were pretty small (to the point where we still felt hungry after uh-oh) so we wanted something extra to tide us over. My sister knows the owner, so he said he'd take care of our dessert as he smoothly took our menus away. He brought us the rum bread pudding and beignets, which were both FANTASTIC: - Rum bread pudding: comes sprinkled with walnut silvers and a side glass of cream you can pour over the top- Beignets: six pillowy mini-donuts draped in powdered sugar with three different sauces on the side (chocolate, raspberry, caramel); after we gobbled up three airy beignets each, we scraped out the remainder of the sauces with our spoons; I swear they should package and sell that raspberry jam Our servers were super friendly and sweet, not at all pushy or obtrusive. But there was a restless busboy who kept wandering up and down the only narrow aisle that leads to the back. Most of his uncomfortable attentiveness seemed unnecessary since he was just openly staring until we finished our plates so he could clear them away. Since the premise of Feast caters more towards group meals, I'll have to try this place a second time (like I need an excuse) and bring a bunch of friends to get the full dining experience.",6,3,3,Mee J.,"New York, NY",276,73,9

5.0,3/7/2013,"Super cute, cozy and inviting place that just opened this week, which I've been eyeing and been wanting to try out.  Really nice rustic/warm ambiance, looks like they put a lot of care into the design and decor of the restaurant.Had dinner here with my bf and friend the other night, and the three of us shared the vegetarian Farmer's Market Feast. The portions didn't look large, but plate after plate kept arriving to our table and it was all delicious and deceptively filling. Seriously, food was really good, and you can definitely taste it in the quality and fresh ingredients. It really was like a chef's tasting menu, and I didn't expect food executed at this level in this off-the-beaten path area.Everything was great but some memorable plates were the beet frites, smoked goat cheese tart, spaghetti squash bolognese (despite the name, we verified that this dish is actually vegetarian, along with the rest of the Farmer's Market Feast). Friend also had the steak & eggs off their ala carte menu and he really enjoyed the steak.They also have root beer on tap, and I felt like a kid having a big mug of it with my fancy meal, but it was really refreshing. Meal was finished off with an apple crumble that came with a little pot of creme fraiche.The servers were really attentive, and they also mentioned that they will be offering breakfast and dinner service for now, with lunch service to come soon. Baking is apparently done on premises. I work nearby and definitely plan to revisit for some coffee and baked treats in the morning!",11,2,3,Anna C.,"New York, NY",103,194,18
