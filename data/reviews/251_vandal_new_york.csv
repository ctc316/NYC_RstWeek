5.0,4/27/2019,"We felt lucky to arrive on a Friday night at 9pm and get seated immediately. This place is beautifully decorated. The food was amazing. We had the Mediterranean salad, fish tacos, Kobe beef sliders and shared the aged steak. Each dish stood on its own, was lovely to look at and was perfectly cooked. The waiter was attentive, curious and super funny. After dinner we hung out at the lounge downstairs. The lounge vibe was more of a party. It was filled with all different types of folks who just wanted to have a good time. I cannot wait to get back here.  I'll describe my experience as simply delicious !!",0,0,0,Shacy B.,"Brooklyn, NY",1,11,9
5.0,4/20/2019,"Loved everything about this place. The ambiance, the music, the decor, and of course the food. I asked the waiter for recommendations, he suggest some brisket bon sliders and cauliflower tacos for appetizers and both were yummy. I had the skirt steak as an entree and it was cooked perfectly, it has a sweet tasty flavor which was delicious. The art work is amazing!!! From the very moment you open the doors, there's art everywhere. Truly was in awe of it all, it was tight up my alley. There was even a violin player playing along to hip hop and pop music which was fun.All in all great experience and plan to go back.",0,0,0,Anais C.,"New York, NY",0,9,15
5.0,4/20/2019,"I figured this place was just a trendy cool spot for drinks. Then my friends and I had dinner and were blown away. The food is out of this world! Every dish creative and the flavors on point. Not to mention the vibe is sexy and fun. I would share photos but we attacked the food too fast to get a good shot. The crispy eggplant was a crowd favorite- I don't even like eggplant and I was begging for a second order. The fish tacos were also delicious. Everything is smaller portions and more sharing style tapas, which is fun cuz you can try so many things. And the prices reasonable. There wasn't one dish we didn't like. The wasabi pea crusted salmon with soba noodles and beets was outstanding. The chicken taquitos so flavorful. Now I'm thinking I want to come back but only for a cheat meal cuz everything is pretty rich. The only complaint is we never got the salmon starter we asked for, but we were distracted by many other dishes.... and hey guess there's next time.",1,0,1,Rachael B.,"West Hollywood, CA",52,322,476
5.0,4/16/2019,"Vandal (the restaurant, never been to the lounge) is now at the top of my list every time people visit! I've been three times and every time has been even better than the last!!The service is always great. With a reservation, you're seated right away and never crammed into a corner haha. The servers are very knowledgable about the menu, all of the specials/dietary options, and cocktails. There are separate gluten-free and vegan menus and the waiters will point out the crossovers between the two if needed.Out of the drinks I've had, the Rio de Frosé is a huge favorite and we always have to order it. The Taxi Line and the Off the Wall were great but not favorites. This month they have a special cocktail benefiting autism awareness (10% of profits are donated) which was the best, even better than the frosé!Running down the list of all of the food I've ordered...Eggplant Meatballs - BRING THESE BACK !! Sorry for the caps but we ordered these the first time we came and they were the absolute best and we still talk about them. All of the flavors were perfect.Roasted Squash Tostadas - Honestly, these are probably the least favorite of ours. The mini tostada shells were good but overall the squash and (definitely) the kale needed more flavor/seasoning.Charred Mushroom Sopes - These were so yummy and definitely a favorite! There were tons of toppings and lots of good things going on in one bite.Crispy Cauliflower Tacos - Another for sure favorite! We've ordered these all three times. The ""taco shell"" is made out of fried wontons which are super good in contrast with the softer, spicier filling. Charred Brussel Sprouts - We were disappointed to hear this last time that despite still being on the menu, they're no longer serving them (I think it's seasonal?). If they are on the menu when you go though, definitely order them!!Miso Glazed Crispy Eggplant - ""Crispy"" is an understatement! It seemed like there was more fried shell than eggplant. They were one of those items that were incredible the first few bites but soon started to taste kind of greasy.Grilled Market Vegetable Enchiladas - Our newest favorite!! Between the fresh vegetables and salsas, they were perfect and we ate them right up! This is definitely the go-to vegetarian entree!",2,2,2,Sydney A.,"New York, NY",23,34,73
1.0,4/16/2019,"When i went to spritz myself with one of the perfumes in the bathroom, a bathroom attendee scowled me to tip before I used anything. She gave me a rude stare and bad tone. So much for great service. As for the food, the mediterranean salad was incredibly overrated, would NOT buy again. My homemade 5 min salads are wayyyy better and that's sad. Also my dessert tasted like chocolate styrofoam. My friend ordered dessert, she never received it. Also if you're splitting bills with your friends, make sure to say beforehand or else you're going to have to add each thing you individually ordered and write it along with your card info.",0,0,0,Jdkdxn B.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,14,0

The highlight was def scallops and risotto and the squid ink lobster pasta YUM !!  We also tried the lamb meatball appetizer but for some reason there came out after the entrees which they were very kind to take off the bill for us ... After dinner we went downstairs to the club and it was packed !!! The DJ was awesome though and the entertainment was def on high , with drinks flowing (dusse on the rocks) it turned out to be a great date night thanks Vandal , oh !

3.0,4/7/2019,"My fiancé and I took my brother here for his 21st birthday last night. Thought it would be a great place to celebrate. The atmosphere is great - very fun and sexy with beautiful decor and lighting. The cocktail menu was great and the drinks were delicious. But then we got the food. The small plates were decent, but the entrees were not good. Nothing was served hot. Literally every dish was served to us lukewarm. I wish I sent a few things back, but I didn't and paid $350 for a very mediocre meal with very slow service. We would have drank more if it didn't take half an hour to get a drink. I would come back for drinks or to go to the lounge downstairs, but I would definitely not come back for food.",0,0,0,Alyssa F.,"Montville, NJ",12,101,16
4.0,4/6/2019,Came here for my friends birthday we had bottle service. It was great but they put us in a table in the back corner. For a large group it was okay but maybe could have been planned better. The service was actually amazing they came over to our table every 5-10 minutes and refilled anything we needed. Definitely Better than some of the other large names we've been to in the past. Luckily the reservation that booked next to us didn't show up so we had some extra room as well. Good music and fun atmosphere. Definitely a good time!,1,0,2,Tom J.,"Manhattan, NY",291,67,31

I don't mind paying for pricey meals but this was expensive Chef Boyardee. I don't know why 0 stars isn't an option but I would consider giving it an irrational number.

4.0,3/28/2019,"Nice venue! Want to come back on a tues, fri or sat for the club part. Food....okay. Server was great and knowledgeable. When asked about the brisket buns, I had to tell him neither of us liked...he took it off the bill.  maybe bc he recommended ‍ kale salad had good flavor, but the kale seemed ""adult"" vs baby kale so more coarse than what I'm used to. He also recommended the cauliflower tacos and they were great! Light, crispy, and flavorful. Drink too pricey for my blood at $17. I'm just not a fancy drink type person. Hostess beautiful and welcoming. Bar area looked cool. Music was poppin at 9 pm. If I came back, I'd go straight to the bar area! Entrance is super cool. Another visitor had to find the door.

5.0,3/26/2019,"We've been to Vandal twice now, and the latest visit last night has solidified it as one of my favorite restaurants in New York. It's a shared plate concept, much like one of the group's other restaurants, Stanton Social (RIP). This is always nice because it allows you to try lots of different dishes and form a true picture of the quality of their stuff. Vandal's true picture is fantastic flavor and great food all around.I think at this point I've tried most things on the menu. Some highlights for me include both the Tortilla Soup Dumplings and the French Onion Soup Dumplings (a dish carried over from the now closed Stanton Social). Take a bite, and it's just a burst of flavor in your mouth. I also really enjoy the Crispy Bao Buns. They pack in flavor with an Asian slaw and perfectly done brisket. Really, I think anything you go with here is going to be good, even the non-remarkable, ordinary dishes such as sweet potato fries and broccoli mac and cheese. They'll blow your taste buds away with whatever you get on your plate. Another good thing is that they can scale orders based on how many people you have at your table, so everyone gets a taste of the goodness.The atmosphere here can't fully be described in words. I could start by saying it's beautiful, artistic, extremely well put together... but really, just look at the pictures. Or, even better, just go see for yourself!",4,2,4,Craig C.,"Jersey City, NJ",145,413,142

5.0,3/20/2019,"For some reason, I always had a negative imagine of Vandal pre-disposed for some reason in my mind, for really zero reason I realized. But I came here last night and that totally changed.Vandal is part of the Tao group and is a very bougie restaurant that also has a club attached! The restaurant is huge, there are multiple dining rooms here, with a ton of huge tables, smaller ones as well. The vibe of the restaurant is clubby and very trendy. There is a lot of cool art installations and decorations throughout. Everywhere you walk, you discover something else so different and so cool. The entrance when I was there last night was a black and white checker theme, and I think this changes frequently. It was very cool and ""instagram-able"". They have a giant purple bunny by the hostess that they are famous for that a lot of people take pictures with as well. And throughout the whole place you can find a lot of cool photo-op spots!I came here with a couple of friends last night and we dined through a promoter one of my friends knew, so we didn't have to pay for anything which was amazing. We sat in the back room, and met them at 9:30 and sat down around 9:45. When we sat, all the other tables were empty, but they all filled up pretty quickly. I was surprised how packed its was for a Tuesday, so late. We had champagne and red and white wine which was good and the servers kept refilling for us. To eat, we had the tortilla soup dumplings which were really great along with the kale Cesar salad. I normally don't like kale but this was really good, and there were Parmesan chips in it which I loved. Then for entrees we had the Branzino which I was so excited about and a margarita pizza to share. Pizza was tasty, nothing out of the ordinary, pretty thin crust. But the Branzino, OMG soooo good. It was served w the head half on which is a little scary to me, but they took the bones out so it was really easy to eat and really flaky. It was charred which made it so delicious. For dessert they served us some kinda like sugary donuts with chocolate/caramel/raspberry sauce which were good. Everything we had as great and I'd love to try even more!After that we went downstairs to the club. I think if you are dining, you can automatically go downstairs. Not the biggest club, but bigger than places like Lavo. Since we were with our promoter, we had a table and bottle service which was great. Unfortunately since it was a Tuesday and I had work the next day, I wasn't looking to drink or party a ton so I didn't really take advantage of this, but definitely would have liked to on a weekend. Definitely a cool place with cool vibes and a place I'd come back to. I'd recommend this place for any kind of celebration, a birthday, anything you want a special, over the top kinda place for!",0,0,0,Kristen W.,"New York, NY",287,130,151
3.0,3/14/2019,"Welllllp....Stanton Social this is not. We had high hopes that since the theme sorta carried over, so would the food and service. Not so, sadly. If I was less of a foodie and more of a trend setter I would probably give this place four stars based on the ambiance. As others have said, this place is downright sexy! Everything is lovely to look at, the lighting is exactly right, the soundtrack is funky and just loud enough, the cocktails are divine. But, alas, the food fell short. We ordered a variety of things, some were decent, others were only ok.  Of course we were comparing all we tried to the quality we had experienced at Stanton Social, and none of it measured up. Even the French onion soup dumplings weren't as good, and it was the exact same recipe!Our server was friendly and attentive initially but the busier the restaurant got, we were forgotten and left waiting with empty plates for much longer than we should have been. It was increasingly difficult to get her attention and we waited so long for dessert and then our check that by the end we were all staring at our phones. With the stiff competition in this city, Vandal really needs to step up its game or it won't last very long. All the gorgeous design and pricey artwork will have been for naught.",0,0,1,Tarra J.,"Sugar Land, TX",40,24,0
2.0,3/14/2019,"Our manager takes us to monthly dinners and someone decided this place was the choice of the month. We had reservations for 8pm and were seated at 9:30pm in the meantime we all were stuck in the bar area and I mean stuck because it was shoulder to shoulder. When we finally sat down to eat the food was subpar. It is a very cool idea to have street food have a home on an actual menu but maybe another place can pick that up since Vandal has clearly failed. I get the hype of the place because it's where young kids who want to blow their money go and good for them. Food wise it was a failure. The ambiance was nice though as everyone looked their best. I would say it had a real Los Angeles feel to it, if you are into that. Luckily I got to try it on someone else's dime.",0,0,0,Wade K.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,6,1
5.0,3/12/2019,"5 Stars 5 Stars!!From the ambience,to the service, to the music,to the food.Vandal has a dark intimate vibe to it but at the same time provides a fun & exciting experience. The restaurant lights are low but the social atmosphere is great and the energy is off the walls. They also play good tunes in the background while you eat.The food and service both were amazing as well.Our waiter was on point:attentive,polite,and helped us pick the best possibly meal for each of us.I got the chicken parm and WHOA what a meal what a meal.  It was a huge portion size,very saucy,and very cheesy. It gets no better than that.The food and drinks aren't too expensive but you will pay a good price for them.

5.0,3/11/2019,"My obsession with Vandal has continued. I came here for my birthday dinner on Friday, and everyone that worked here was super friendly. Unlike my recent experiences at other Tao venues. I love the concept of shareable dishes. Between three girls we ordered the steak, the kale Caesar (which is one of the best I've ever had), the cauliflower tacos, the sweet potato fries, and a couple of drinks. Everything was amazing. My favorite thing about this place is that every time you're here you notice something different about the décor. I love how many different art installments there are. In the few years I have been going here the front hallway entrance is always changing. They have a fantastic happy hour too, that's totally worth going to, even if you aren't drinking and just want their snacks. This place doesn't get enough credit for how good food is either. The lounge below is lots of fun too, I've gone with a promoter, but you can also access it if you eat dinner from the restaurant. On a super busy night if you're a mixed group of girls and boys, they just make you open a super reasonable tab ($75) that gets you a certain number of drinks. Overall, extremely reasonable and whimsical place. I always take people from out of town here.",2,0,2,Marie S.,"New York, NY",297,143,289
3.0,3/10/2019,"Vandal, Vandal, Vandal! Oh, how much I wanted to enjoy you. Lemme put it on the table - the music saved the night. A jam session (old school and new hip-hop) capped off an evening that consisted of slight disorganization and mediocre food. I came here on Saturday (March 2) for a friend's birthday dinner. We were told we'd have to wait until the entire party arrives before we could sit. Cool, no issues. Here is where I was confused - we went up to the hostess and informed her that everyone is here, then she proceeded to give us a beeper that will buzz once a table is ready. More waiting. I think it would be more time efficient to give us the beeper while we wait for the rest of the party to arrive. Nonetheless, we waited for 40 mins before we were seated. We sit and order our meals. I ordered the chicken taquitos for an app and it had a strong curry taste. Different but good. Alot of us ordered the marinated chicken and potato puree with mushroom glaze for an entree. The glaze tasted burnt. The chicken was undercooked and the manager was kind enough to offer something else off the menu. It was after midnight and the restaurant was set to close at 1 am. We declined his offer and he countered with cocktails. A few people did accept that. The macaroni and cheese was good, especially the day after. Like Yelper Johanna said, Vandal's decor is sultry and sexy. As Yelper Petrina said decor, decor and that is the selling point. People clearly come for the photos and to post on social media. TBH it's quite annoying that you gotta constantly maneuver around people taking photos in a place that is already packed! But I get it, considering the times we are in. I do want to return for brunch during the warmer months. Dinner? Most likely not.",1,0,0,Chika D.,"Brooklyn, NY",88,62,140

But my fav was the eggplant balls. The drinks come strong. Vibe was solid as per the usual. Trendy etc etc. I must say. I miss Stanton social and the vibe there. But after 15 years.

2.0,2/23/2019,"Came to Vandal with a group of 6 around 830/45pm on a Friday evening. We were going to get a drink before a dinner nearby that our group was on the wait list for. When we realized we had two more hours to go on the waitlist at uncle boons around 9pm we decided to see if there was an opening here for food. Although the restaurant was absolutely packed (and it's huge!!!!), they were able to seat the 6 of us immediately. The vibes were a bit confusing. You walk in through this checkered art exhibit and then the actual restaurant has more of a street vibe.  There's a video/photo touchscreen area to take pics with your group. There's an espresso/coffee cart. There's a lounge downstairs. There's a huge bar area. Multiple rooms of tables to eat. There's a lot going on to say the least. Going into dinner I could tell that it was the type of place you go to be seen or maybe eat there before you go to the lounge downstairs for a table. I'll preface that this crowd is definitely not my scene. Girls were taking seductive pics on the bathroom line and on the stairs inside the restaurant. If you are into this type of spot then definitely try it out, but I'm not one to go to a restaurant just to post my face on insta or try to be in ""the scene."" I rather just go to a normal spot for some quality food and a solid drink.With that said....we ordered a bunch of apps for the table to start. Cauliflower tacos, squash tostadas, 3 types of sliders, and hamachi crudo. The hamachi was really tasty and we enjoyed all of the sliders (beef, tuna, brisket). No one really liked the squash tostadas or cauliflower tacos. The squash was super crunchy and undercooked and the tostada was soggy. The cauliflower taco was greasy and over seasoned. I was expecting roasted or grilled cauliflower inside the taco but it was minced to imitate a ground meat. We then ordered the strip steak, fried rice, rigatoni, eggplant, brussels, scallops and fries. The waitress should have told us this was way too much food. The fried rice was very soft and greasy. I didn't try the eggplant or Brussels or scallops. Sweet potato fries were pretty good but had a TON of parsley on them. Steak was cooked medium rare as we ordered but not a quality cut - pretty dry and not flavorful. The rigatoni had no business being on the menu and tasted like jarred sauce with a glob of ricotta melted in. I'm not sure anyone comes here for the food. It's super overpriced for mediocre eats. Would not come back for the food or drinks. I'll repeat this wasn't my vibe, but a lot of others would probably enjoy the drinks/lounge atmosphere!",3,3,0,Alexandra T.,"Jersey City, NJ",353,407,326

1.0,2/17/2019,"5 stars for the food and there service at the restaurant. Minus 5 stars for our waiter and the bouncer at the night club downstairs.It was my friend's 30th birthday last night and we decided to celebrate it at the Vandal's restaurant and later their night club downstairs. Everything went great in the restaurant: the food ad wine were delicious and the service was superb. After spending close to $1K there for our group, we went downstairs to their nightclub. The night started great with us ordering 4 bottles of alcohol spending close to $2K in few hours. However, as soon as we took it easy on the alcohol and start ordering less, the waiter (hispanic looking) came with one of the bouncers and told us that we need to leave. We could not believe it! After spending close to $3K here, they rudely tried to kick us out of our bottle service booth! I tried talking to the waiter and friendly told him that what they are doing is not fair, but he started offending me and literally telling me that he ""doesn't give a fuck"" about what I think.  Incredibly unprofessional! I have never been to a place before that I have felt humiliated like this and where I felt that the waiters and bouncers saw me and my group as purely profit! The manager talked to us, apologized, and tried to save the night by buying us drinks, but it was already too late. We left their nightclub with $3K spent there and a destroyed birthday party. Their restaurant is running smoothly and I'll recommend to everyone to go and give it a chance! Their nightclub, however, it's equipped with undertrained staff who only cares about your money and doesn't know a bit of good customer service!

2.0,2/16/2019,"Restaurant was lovely. Food was delicious, especially the apps (try the French Onion Soup Dumplings, and the cauliflower tacos) The club downstairs was a completely different story, staff were incredibly rude and unaccommodating, moving us to a different table and then even trying to kick us out of the club after we stopped buying more booze. Especially unprofessional considering that we paid for bottle service including 3 bottles of grey goose at around $600 each. Manager tried to make it right by apologizing and buying us a round of drinks. That's why 2 stars instead of 1. Staff needs to be trained to be polite and not nearly as aggressive when dealing with ""problems"". We were not causing trouble or bothering the other patrons, but we're nonetheless harassed by the bouncer and one of the waiters and treated like belligerent drunks.  Had they even tried to hear our side of the story (table next to us was being rude and actually throwing trash at us, seemingly without reason) I'm sure there wouldn't have been any problem. My advice to management would be to train the club staff better to be respectful, friendly, and helpful in dealing with customers, instead of defaulting to rudeness and escalating non-issues. That, or separate the club from the restaurant so the bad reviews on the club don't bring down an otherwise great restaurant.",2,0,0,Lucas C.,"UC Campus Area, Berkeley, CA",5,2,0

4.0,2/16/2019,"Vandal is one of my favorite spots in the city. I have been here for eating AND I have been here for partying. Both are pretty legit. Restaurant wise: I had an awesome server. He was very assertive and attentive. I wish I remembered his name because this guy did no wrong. Gave us recommendations and was fast with everything. I recommend the pork bao buns, they were my favorite. I also had their tacos- not a huge fan cause they were small and not the best to share. I like that they have music in the background. The ambiance of this place is very shall I say sexy? Nice music with the perfect volume and dark lighting. The interior design is also awesome and very modern. Make sure to take a picture with the pink giant at the entrance. Great for a photoshoot. Club wise: there are multiple table options or you can just be on the floor. There isn't really a dance floor since it is more of a longer. DJ was spinning hot fire all night. I am very picky with music so if I like it I know he's good. Top 40s, 90s throwbacks and very light remixed house. I'll come back for sure. I celebrated my birthday here last year and had a BLAST!",0,0,0,Ashley A.,"Huntington Station, NY",326,27,96

The drinks were great, flavorful and so different!! This server was so helpful and knowledgeable about the menu she suggested I ordered the roasted chicken and It was honestly a great suggestion. I'm unfortunately my initial order came out wrong but when speaking to the manager who was very helpful and always on the floor he happily got me my order and actually give it to me on the house which was so nice of him! Because it was my birthday they actually offered me a free cupcake that came with the candle on it it was so cute and the cupcake was like really really good. And because the manager felt so bad that because it is my birthday and they got my order wrong they actually gave me two extra desserts so they give me the donuts with came with three different sauces there was a chocolate sauce and caramel sauce and I believe strawberry sauce.

4.0,2/14/2019,"3.5 stars. I came here to celebrate my birthday last month with my friends. The first room before entering the hostess area was interesting; it was an optical illusion room. Staring at the walls for too long will make you a tad dizzy. We had a reservation for a party of 10 and we were seated right away. This was my first time here and from the outside of the restaurant, I did not know it was so big. The decor and ambience was amazing and instagram-worthy!The drinks here are all amazing, but if you have a high tolerance, give the Frose a try! The beef tartare was good but they did change how this item is served from what my friends said. It use to be served on a big NY pretzel. The soup dumplings were okay, a bit salty and there was no soup. The branzino was great, cooked to perfection and served with a side of enoki mushrooms. We ordered the 35-day dry aged NY strip, medium-rare and it was dry, it didn't have natural juices bleeding out of it. The prime skirt steak had the right amount of char and the Thai fried rice that came with it was excellent. The scallops were my favorite but they could of use a bit less salt because they are naturally salty anyways from the seawater. For dessert, we got the sampler. Prepare to take your phones out to take photos because it is definitely picture-worthy. The best dessert was the vanilla and fudge ice cream rolled in POP ROCKS! Yesss, you heard right!Overall, I enjoyed my experience here but the food is a bit salty for my taste. Our waitress was amazing and always kept the drinks coming.

4.0,2/7/2019,"Can a restaurant be described as sexy? Even sultry? If you're Vandal, absolutely.I'm not sure if I'm writing about a restaurant or an experience. Vandal--you have pulled out all the stops to certainly impress me.I dined here last night--but I did not select Vandal because frankly, I was unaware of its presence, but my oh my, I am returning. I visited with someone who knows all the trendy NYC spots including Vandal.Upon entrance, i was immediately intrigued. The space was black and white (and Instagrammable)--i couldn't find the door. It resembled an art gallery exhibit. We had 8:45 reservations in one of 3 gorgeous  dining rooms. I was told there is music on the weekends on the lower level. I wasn't surprised to learn this because Vandal is out to impress. After all, it belongs to the Tao Group family.While we waited for our table, we took a seat at the bar where happy hour was on tap all night through Thursday. This included food and drinks. We both ordered a smooth Pinot Noir.When it appeared that our table wouldn't be ready any time soon (it was 8:55 at this point), we settled comfortably at the bar where the full menu was also honored in addition to the happy hour menu.Here's where Vandal lacked. The food.We ordered:*fish tacos--avoid. 4 mini tacos in a serving and tasted extremely fishy.*chicken taquitos--these were good. Cut into maki-like pieces, they were satisfying*wild mushroom pizza--my favorite and cooked perfectly with thin crust and lots of mushrooms*bao bun--just one and I didn't taste it since it included beef brisket We also ordered an eggplant small plate but it never made it to us.Overall, the food was mediocre. I definitely was not wowed. The happy hour prices for food and wine was very reasonable--a good consolation for the average food.I cannot write about other items on the menu and/or the quality of food.To break it down, the food merits 2-3 stars but the vibe and atmosphere  of Vandal merits 4-5 stars. It's an experience!You might even feel like someone important.Overall opinion: wow.Do check it out.",30,18,29,Johanna B.,"Brooklyn, NY",468,560,1574

3.0,2/3/2019,"Description of the restaurant says globally inspired.. after tasting their food on a sat night in Feb, I would say it's Pan Asian. The art in here is cool but super trippy. Felt like Willy wonka's house. Everything on the food menu has a mild spicy ting to it. From Thai rice, to Brussels sprouts, to rigatoni. One of my guests is on keto and they don't have any keto foods at Vandal besides the brussel sprouts FYI. Portions were perfect. Not too much and not too little and left you full. Drink menu on the food menu wasn't really appealing. Stoli is too cheap of a liquor for mixed drinks on a menu.. atmosphere is chill. Music is loud. It's the same music from the dj playing downstairs in the lounge. To go to the lounge you need to exit the place but stay in the warm lobby and make a right into the entrance of the club. You show your id get a fake stamp on your wrist (unless it's a black light stamp, can't tell). Next there is a desk with 2 people on the left, but their useless. You go down a flight of stairs. If you go straight you run into a hidden door with no markings or people saying that's the entrance to the club.. club is full of teeny boppers and music was rap and changed every 2 mins. Drinks were made by a female bartender and  strong. Coat check room is also a hidden door with no markings but people standing outside a closed door. Very weird. We were waiting for 2 more people, a guy and girl. Bouncer said it's free for the girl and $100 for the guy which is ridiculous cause all 4 of us girls got in for free.

I would wear a dress, a cute romper, a nice button down and dress pants for men, or a nice top & skirt for ladies. The staff was nice and attentive. However, I didn't like that the waitress wouldn't let me do a separate check. The food was pretty good but pretty small portions for the price you pay. They don't have coronas which is my go to beer, but they had cusqueña which i love also. So, I was happy with that. I love Latin American beers. The music was absolutely amazing. They mixed it up with all types of music which made me dance all night at the table. The bathrooms were clean and they had a bathroom attendant which comes in handy. However, remember to bring a dollar or two to tip the bathroom attendant. The prices are kind of high, but you pay for the experience. We then went downstairs to the club section.

They have this checker print room that looks amazing to me but it can be dizzy for others. You enter through the door and the people in the front would be happy to check you in. As usual, the purple bunny figure is at the left side. So, I'm a little disappointed in the foods. The first time I came here, the foods tasted a lot better. This time, it was so off. If I have to pick a favorite dish, it would be the branzino. It was flaky. We had the french onion soup dumplings, it wasn't even juicy. All the soup fell to the bottom of the plate it came in before we even took it out. The wild mushroom pizza was good. The mushroom was juicy and the pizza was thin and crispy. The New York hot pretzel steak tartare also looked different. It didn't come on top of the pretzel. I don't know how it came still be consider as a pretzel steak tartare. The pan seared scallop was too salty. Everything was just salty. The prime skirt steak was decent. The steak didn't have a lot of flavors but the rice made up for it. As for the 35 days aged steak, it was on the dry side for rare. You see slight pinkness inside. The fried eggplant was good. As for the sample dessert plate, it's instagram worthy but nothing that's mind blowing. Apparently, they have a club here. The waitresses said she could take us down to have a look.

The risotto that came with the scallops are to die for. The Brussel sprouts were the best I have ever had wow. Their dessert was fantastic as well and it had pop rocks in it which was such an interesting twist! Gram cracker and pop rock crust covered ice cream cake amazing.

By 10:00, standing outside for an hour and a half we were shocked that NOBODY from the general admission line had been let in yet and hundreds of people were waiting in the rain soaking wet. Despite the horrible weather, there was absolutely ZERO coordination or structure by the establishment. People were pushing, cutting and shoving into each other. The bouncers were clueless and gave no information. My friend, who had bought a fast pass ticket and let in at 10:00 (half an hour after open bar had started) asked the bartender why nobody was being let in and they claimed that they did not want to 'bombard' the staff. Are you kidding me? Hundreds of people who paid for a specific promise were forced to wait outside in the rain because the venue was too cheap to hire some extra staff?After waiting two hours in line and not at all moving we decided to leave.

1.0,1/1/2019,"One of the most ridiculous and unprofessional experiences of my life was NYE last night. Not only did people pay over 100 dollars for this event, but the tickets said the doors open at 9. My group arrived at 8:45 in order to get in early and instead had to wait in the line until 10:15 in the POURING rain. The only way we actually got in by 10:15 is paying ANOTHER 40 dollars each to cut the line and purchase a ""fast pass."" When we got in, the room was completely empty and probably had around 50 people in there tops, while hundreds of people waited online freezing and getting rained on.  Then my group was not allowed downstairs and the man standing there was no help at ALL then finally after 2 hour excursion we could drink our ""open bar"" that was supposed to be from 9-1.

1.0,1/1/2019,"One star is too many. What a disastrous experience last night for New Year's eve. We bought tickets for the event that was being hosted ahead of time. We soon found out that the venue was over booked (even though the location Twitter was still promoting the event) and they forced some people to refund their tickets. We were able to keep our tickets (unfortunately). Long story short, got to the venue at 9pm. (Open bar starts at 9:30). Stood outside in the rain until 10:30pm with no movement. In addition, there was no policing of the line outside. We got cut twice, I personally got threatened by a drunk on the line and the establishment had absolutely no law and order. They also didn't come out to explain what was going on or what the holdup was. I don't do these things often, but honestly what a poorly run establishment and event. If you can't deliver on what you're promoting, step back and stick to being a restaurant. Not only is it annoying, it's dangerous to run it poorly.

We waited in line for three hours and the line hardly moved. The venue was overbooked and could not accommodate the crowd when people purchased tickets well in advance. This is a horrible experience partying in the city for New Year's Eve when people plan so far in advance for the night to go as smooth as possible. The venue clearly messed up and did not prep for the event. There's too many good places in NY so places need to step up their game especially when people are over paying for tickets.

Lack of line queue and safety Mgmt- we were cut in line, threatened and no staff was managing the line outside or ensuring safety,  it was a scary situation and caused us to leave due to harassment and lack of management by the venue.4. Recieved an email via eventbrite for refund and then in the replies they refuse to issue a refund. Are you guys idiots?5. Lack of communication - we are steps away from the front since 8:30pm and not once did staff come outside to check on the customers in line or help explain what was going on, why people couldn't get in. The oversold tickets, including for fast track, made this a horrible scene plus idiots that are running this place lack customer experience knowledge. Please go out of business and let someone else open up a business that actually serves NYC properly, you idiots. You give the TAO group a bad name.Horrible experience.

3.0,12/28/2018,"For anyone reading this, keep in mind this is my personal experience and based on my perspective. I'm giving this place 3 stars because the ambiance is nice, it's a big place with the main floor being the restaurant side and the basement being the club section. I feel the main ""attraction"" is the large pink bunny doing the one handed hand stand by the entrance which a majority of people who live in or visit NYC takes pictures with. There's also a table in front of the bunny statue that has a bowl full of free boxes of matches that said Vandal on them which I liked because I love playing with fire. The food is savory and good but it's way too over priced for the portion size of the dishes. I will say that the main thing about Vandal's food is that you're meant to get several dishes to split among the people in your party. People don't generally order one dish per person but rather several dishes that everyone eats from. It's a nice concept especially for the price because then everyone can split the bill evenly and that can dramatically lower the cost of the bill the more people are involved. However, if you choose to share don't go if you haven't eaten anything all day because the portions are already small and to have to split it makes your share much less. The main thing that bothered me about the particular night I went was the waitress we got. She seemed nice but I was receiving a vibe from her like she was annoyed at us because we asked if another friend who was near could join our table, we didn't want to just tell him it's okay to come if he wasn't part of the initial reservation so we asked our waitress for permission. She said it was fine but kept asking how far away he was and how long he would take to get there. Understandably, it was a Friday night and she's probably taking into account the other tables in her sections and other possible reservations which she did kind of imply just by saying that it was a Friday night and it's usually one of the busiest days but from my perspective, there were several empty tables in our area and it didn't seem all that crowded. Keep in mind the restaurant is quite large, it's kind of like a maze considering the walk to the bathroom meant we had to go through several other rooms with lots of tables and many people but I'm referring to the specific area we were in which wasn't as crowded as the rest of the restaurant and I know waiters/waitresses cover a specific section. This was getting me annoyed because in order for our friend to be able to join us and so we don't lose the table we had to keep ordering until our friend arrived because she kept saying it was so busy but her section wasn't compared to the rest. We ordered two more things to buy us time but since the portions are so small it finished quick and we didn't want to keep racking up the bill so we decided to just leave because we felt constant pressure from her since she kept circling our table.",0,0,0,Grace L.,"Jamaica, NY",1,10,7
4.0,12/24/2018,"Obviously (as indicated by the ridiculously high prices) Vandal has very good food. Will I ever taste anything better than the crepe cake? Maybe, I'm not sure, but it was very good. I went here for my friends birthday and our server made sure to really go above and beyond. I feel like he risked a lot for us to have a good time (he didn't check our IDs). The whole theme of the place is street food from around the world and a heavy emphasis on sharing. There are a fair amount of options in general but less for vegetarians. I think the biggest take away I had from dining at Vandal is that poverty is glamorized in theory  (the whole restaurant is themed around very cheap food) but when confronted with poverty in everyday life, people ignore it and admonish it (located right next to the Bowery Mission - talk about a show of gentrification!)

4.0,12/22/2018,"Seems like a great place for dinner and then bar. Great service, got there around 1130pm on a Friday and the food came out pretty quickly.FOOD: We got the Brussel sprouts (saucy, smokey and a little tart), not the best I've ever had but good. If you prefer crisper sprouts you may not like these. Also got the sweet potato fries, simple but so delicious with a hint of salt and I could Not stop eating them. Fries come with a side of mustard and ketchup. The lobster pasta was good,the corn added a nice sweetness and balance to the subtle creamy flavor of the dish. There could have been more lobster in it for the price but the dish in general was a sizeable portion. The braised chicken tacos were probably my favorite..the smokiness and flavor in that chicken was to die for! There was also a slight kick with the green Chile cream that came on the side, which I loved. Corn tortillas aren't my favorite but made the dish more authentic,still delicious. And lastly we got the Margherita pizza, cheesy and tasty with a perfectly crisp crust soft on the inside.....overall I will be back for the tacos.DESSERT: Had the chocolate bourbon milkshake shot, you can Definitely taste the bourbon. The shot is rich and very thick, just thick enough to barely make it through the straw..I'd compare it to a Wendy's frosty, except smoother and prettier, not bad at all. ATMOSPHERE: You walk right in through this black and white checkered room if you're just going for dinner, if you're going for the bar you have to stand in line. We switched seats to a romantic corner booth that gave us a great view of the restaurant. Love the wall art including the huge engraved murals. Different areas have interesting backdrops great for picturesDim mood lighting, if you're trying to have good convo maybe go to another restaurant because you have to talk pretty loud over the music..good throwback music being played though!Will be back next time I'm in NY(for the tacos)might check out the bar next time!",0,0,0,Michelle E.,"Dallas, TX",221,42,38

2.0,12/9/2018,"Have been here a couple times but service and food quality are not as good as they used to be. Only reason I gave 2 stars was because the new dessert - what looked to be a ""cloud burger"" - chocolate pudding pavlova was super delicious. Otherwise it was a bad experience for us - we lost our appetites mid way and ended up going somewhere else for food and drinks. The drinks were poor, the Red bell pepper one was the better one of all but we had to substitute the alcohol and add spice to it which made it better - that was our recommendation, bar tender didn't offer us that change. The entree - what was a medium rare good looking steak - came out before 2 of our appetizers. We asked to get our last 2 appetizers as an entree for me while my fiancé ordered a steak which were due to come out the same time. Then they ended up having us wait 25 minutes for the appetizers and said don't worry we'll make you a new steak. We asked where the steak was when the 2 apps came out and they said they're making a fresh one so it would take 20 minutes. We ordered another round of drinks while my apps got cold, waiting for the steak. I ended up trying one of the appetizers we ordered which was lobster sopes, there was no lobster at all - we asked the waiter if there was any lobster in the lobster sopes and he said no it's all mushrooms, we had to sub it out because there was dairy and you had an allergy. Um - why not tell me that it would be substituted and ask if I wanted something else - lobster and mushroom - 2 completely different foods, did not want mushrooms on top of corn sopes, I wanted to have seafood while my fiancé had steak... The steak finally came out after another 25 minutes - it was the same exact steak - now cooked medium well. My fiancé never has steak sauce with steak - he says it takes away from the flavor of the meat, meanwhile he had to drown the chewy steak in sauce just to tolerate getting through barely half of it, and we were hungry by then having to wait so long for our food to come. We only wish the main manager came up to ask us about the food after all this and not before we got our food when things were still fine. They ended up comping the sopes because we didn't eat it... that's standard practice when you mess up, nothing special but we expected to have the last round of drinks comp'd at least for having to wait so long for our food. No such luck!Not sure I'd come back here again unless it was just for dessert or for some wine in the beautiful scenery.

Here are some of the highlights:- Service is impeccable. Staff is friendly and attentive, and don't get annoyed if you want to order food in rounds. They took the menus and brought them back when we were ready to order more, which I thought was a nice touch.- The vibe is cool. The restaurant is pretty big, but it gets packed with people of all ages. It's the kind of place that makes you feel like you're in the know for being there.- The food - the most important part! I am now vegan, and they had a pretty extensive vegan menu. The mushroom sopes were the best thing I had. I am already planning my next trip back to get them again. The eggplant meatballs were tasty, too, and I also really enjoyed the veggie enchiladas. - The drinks - also amazing! Their cocktail menu includes creative options.

It was unnecessary especially because we all ordered an ample amount. Lastly for my friends birthday he said he would put a candle on the s'mores dessert which he did not. They brought out the two desserts we ordered without any candle. Than I commented where is the candle and 5 minutes later they brought out a chocolate cupcake with a candle. The bill came out and of course they charged us for both desserts and comped the cupcake that we didn't want. It's silly especially because the waiter said whatever we choose will be the birthday dessert. Bad move on the waiters part because his tip would have exceeded 20 % and it was a hefty bill.

1.0,10/30/2018,"I don't know if I went on a bad day or this is how things are normally run here, but I can't ignore how bad the food and the service there was. I ordered the chicken tacos which were super tiny and ridiculously mediocre in taste(and not to mention slightly cold). One taco = one bite. Being that there were 3 tacos, after the first bite/taco I went up to the waitress and expressed that I was not happy with my meal. She asked if there was anything else I wanted from the menu, which I genuinely did not given that 2 out of the 3 friends I was with told me their meals weren't that great either, so I declined hoping that she would possibly consider removing it from the bill so that the only bad taste I would be left with from this restaurant was the food. This was not the case. She barley even expressed interest toward the matter. And gave me a crude ""give me a second""  In the meantime I stepped away to go to the bathroom and once I got back to my table, the meal was still there in the same spot which was a surprise to me since the restaurant was more than halfway empty and nowhere near busy at the time. 15 minutes later I flagged down another wait to tell him about the food l, to which he replied ""I'll go tell the waitress"". Five minutes later the waitress comes back out and gives me a ""complementary"" dessert, which I later found out was the same price as what I ordered, so it was more like a trade off. I don't know if giving me something I didn't particularity want or ask for was a way for them to erase the fact that the food was bad, but she left the tacos on the bill anyway. The final straw I had with this restaurant was when I asked for the ""complementary"" dessert to be boxed up to take with me in the interest of not wasting anymore food. I didn't want the dessert to go to waste like the tacos did so I asked one of the male waiters in our area to take it to go. He came back with the dessert boxed up in a bag, but what I didn't realize until the car ride home when looked in the bag was that the dessert was completely upside down! Carelessly just thrown in the container. Here is the picture of it. All in all I will not be visiting Vandal ever again.",5,0,0,Ja'Nice G.,"Brooklyn, NY",359,7,5

4.0,10/24/2018,"Tao group at its finest. You walk in and you immediately know who owns the place. Basement level is a night club, ground level is a restaurant. You probably know it from the instagrams of its big purple bunny turned upside down. This is a fantastic place to bring tourists who want to feel that chic New York City vibe. Something glamorous and street at the same time. You'll want to get dressed trendier on the night you visit vandal. My suggestion is to go upstairs for dinner with a group and order a bunch -- nice thing is, they'll give you your dishes with enough for everyone to try. So if there are 12 people, they'll hook you up with 12 tacos. Just be prepared, as most clubs in NYC do, the menu is pricey. Once you're done with the dinner, head downstairs to dance all night. So much fun! Again, drinks are pricey and bottles are crazier. Bottle service is about $650 per bottle.

We had a reservation for 3 at 6:30pm on a Friday night and were seated immediately. The restaurant was practically empty when we walked in. However, by the end of our dining experience (around 8:00ish), the restaurant did fill up rather quickly. The ambiance was my favorite out of all of the restaurants my NY-native friend too me to all weekend. Art fills the walls, the lighting is appropriately low, the service is quick and friendly. The food, however, is why I am giving Vandal 5 stars. Between the three of us, we ordered about 5 different items to share among the table. Each were satisfying in size for small plates and phenomenal in flavor. We ordered the tortilla soup dumplings, crispy cauliflower tacos, braised chicken tacos, old school chicken parm, and the eggplant meatballs. The tortilla soup dumplings were not only aesthetically pleasing, but literally melted in your mouth the moment you ate them.

5.0,10/11/2018,"I have not done a review in 2 years but I was so impressed by the food here that I had to do a review. This was probably one of the best meals I have ever had and I am an insanely picky person! We came here on a rainy Thursday night at 5:00PM, and there were only a couple of tables that were filled. First of all when I first looked at the menu, the names and descriptions of the dishes are very vague and it definitely do not do the food justice. That is when Jorge came in. He gave us recommendations with detailed descriptions of the dishes and he was so right on point! Cocktails ($17)- Definitely on the pricey end. They were nice and strong but unremarkable.  Tortilla soup dumplings (~$14)- Being around the Chinatown area, I was thinking this was a Joe's Shaghai knockoff and extremely skeptical. But Jorge insisted on getting it and he even offered to send it back to the kitchen if we didn't like it (how's that for confident)!This was the most unique yet delicious dish I have ever had. There were 6 individual spoons. Each spoob had a luke warm tomato soup/base with these shumai like puff/dumplings that were crisp on the outside but when you bite in there's this gooey light cheese inside. So hard to explain but a must!!Pan seared scallops with creamy orzo ($34)- 3 gigantic diver scallops that were cooked to perfection! It came with a cheezy orzo side with chunks of thick bacon. My boyfriend said the orzo did get a bit salty towards the last couple of bites, perhaps it needed a tomato base or some acid to off set the creaminess. Main lobster pasta ($34) - PERFECTION! Tons of lobster bits with squid ink tagliatelle pasta. It cane with a creamy, tomato sauce with corn. Such a strange combination but good to the last drop. I wish the portion was bigger!Vandal smores ($14)- Once again, this dessert had a lackluster description but Jorge convinced us! I usually don't like smores because it is too sweet but this just had the perfect sweetness (perfect for sharing). It resembled more of a pie. The top was sort of a marshmallow meringue but it was more creamy than sweet. The middle was similar to chocolate fudge with a buttery graham cracker crust. It came with graham cracker ice cream (also insanely good, closest to a caramel vanilla).  The only critique that I would have is that maybe tablecloths would have made it classier? I mean, they had a bathroom attendant, so why not tablecloths? In addition, the prices were on the high end, so it's definitely a special occasion splurge!",1,0,2,Khin Z.,"Woodside, NY",15,206,11

After that she did not check to see if we were satisfied with our entrees or if we needed additional drinks which we did. Upon the completion of our meal we were not even asked if we wanted desert, we were simply brought the check and told they would waive the cover charge if we wanted to go down to the lounge since we had eaten there.

Thankfully, the venue is really large (it's actually hidden behind a small art gallery like a speakeasy!) so there was plenty of seating.I ordered the Yellowtail Crudo as my appetizer (pretty good slices of yellowtail sashimi but nothing special) and the Prime Skirt Steak as my entrée. The steak was very tender and came paired with such fragrant Thai fried rice cooked with coconut milk. My only complaint is that it was a little too undercooked -- I ordered medium and some of the slices were still super red in the middle. It's also way overpriced (at $46!) if you don't come here for Restaurant Week.For dessert, I got the churros with spicy chocolate. These were probably the best churros I've ever had in NYC! They're fried to the point that they practically melt in your mouth like cotton candy. The spicy chocolate was also a lot spicier than I thought. They weren't make-your-eyes-water spicy but definitely had a kick to it.Overall it was a good Restaurant Week experience but I don't think I'd come back for its regular menu.

4.0,8/16/2018,"Another Chris Santos joint steals my heart. I came here on a Saturday night to celebrate my birthday. I had a 630 reservation but arrived closer to 7pm, I did call to let the hostess know that my group was running late (thanks rain and NYC traffic) but when we arrived we were greeted with a ""You're late, what happened?"" which was super awkward and unnecessary since we were about 20-25 minutes late not like 2 hours late and had already given notice but I digress because the food and our server more than made up for our not so pleasant hostess experience.  We knew based on other reviews that we had to try the bao buns so we did and they were soooo good. OMG, I woke up thinking of those bao buns the next day. We also ordered the steak tartare which is served on a pretzel with a mustard sauce and cut into bite size pieces which makes it very easy to share. The last two apps we ordered were the braised chicken tacos and the skewers which were also good but not as memorable as the tartare and bao buns. For entrees we ordered the scallops, chicken parm, tomahawk steak and a kobe beef burger they had as a special that evening. The meal was so memorable that I cannot wait to go back.",0,0,0,Stephanie L.,"Brooklyn, NY",143,68,101

The pizza was juicy and flavorful, and the crust was just thin enough to provide a base to support the taste of the pizza itself.

Not for me though, but I was there :)Our party arrived, as most due in small pockets. So finally we were seated and the waiter made himself familiar with the table. He ran off the specials, the drink options, his personal recommendations, and patiently waited for us all to get ready. We order our 1st round of drinks and began to peruse the menu, by the 3rd sip I was ready. There were too many people at the table but we all managed to get our orders in and due to an unexpected wait, we received complimentary shots and crispy Bao Buns... like the name suggests there is some oil involved in this dish. The buns themselves tasted as though they'd been fried... no Bueno. That was my only hang-up with this place.I ordered the Bao Buns (before realizing the buns were fried), sweet potatoes fries, and a Heineken. The fries were the highlight of my meal to be honest. Others at the table order the pizza, sea bask tacos, and the crispy cauliflower taco.... All delicious options.

Once I walked in, the place reaked of dirtiness and garbage - the staff was helpless to their environment. The promoters that were running the door the night of my attendance were acting as if they were better than me and I was already inside the venue (usually they act this way after you can't get in but who can judge them) - gotta love a career that consists of judging people based on their appearance. Would never bring a client here for a drink, dinner, anything. Lost out on a serious potential lead that could've brought you serious business and a ton of traffic. Expect a terrible social media review as well. You guys fucking suck.

I'm not sure what kind of dressing was on there, it was good but I don't think I'd order again. Chicken parm and the salmon were by far my favorite. Chicken was SOOOO delicious and it was a decent piece of chicken too!!! Salmon was delicious as well. For desert we had this strawberry custard and a mini espresso milkshake.

Everything on the menu is separate so be prepared to come out of your pockets unless you're not that hungry lol... The crispy tao buns and cauliflower tacos were amazingggg! I also ordered the salmon which was good but very basic in flavor by itself. However, it does come over this artichoke salad that brings the flavor out if eaten together. I wasn't a fan of the eggplant but it had a peanut base to it that was very strong for me. If you like the taste of peanuts in your food you might love it!

Frose (or is it Froze?)...such a delicious, addictive cocktail! Food favorites were the mushroom pizza, tortilla soup dumplings, and lobster sopes. But the real star was the dessert.

My friend and I came on a Thursday night and ordered the sticky rice dumplings ($14), the crispy bao buns ($16), Prime skirt steak ($46), and the churros! The interior is pretty cute with all of the art murals on the walls, it's loungey and hip. It's definitely a weekend type of dinner. The music is loud and the crowd looks great. Definitely a place where you can dress like you're going out. Our favorite appetizer was probably the crispy bao buns. They were so unique and delicious! The steak I thought was cooked really well, but the entire dish just kind of came out lukewarm. The rice wasn't piping hot and neither was the steak. I think that kind of ruined the meal a little bit for me. The flavors of the food were also not authentic at all. I know Vandal is supposed to be a fusion type restaurant, but it was highly americanized and just pretty flat in flavor. Overall, I don't think that I would return.

I had reservations for 8:30 for 3 of my gfs and I. The hostesses where very sweet and got us seated quickly. The atmosphere was very nyc ish which I enjoy. I was surprised at how casual one could come to dinner but it was nice to see the restaurant wasn't stuck up! Our waiter came around 7 mins after being seated. He explained the menu to us then took our drink orders. We then after about another 7 mins order apps. We ordered the sea bad tacos yum, kale Caesar salad yum, and the eggplant meatballs! All were very good and shareable. He added an extra taco for $8.00 dollars which I guess is okay in price. After finishing our apps we couldn't get our waiter back to our table for about 20 mins. We had to ask another waiter to go find him. He returned and we ordered our meals: margarita pizza-yum, scallops-yum, rosé ravioli- not the best and the linguini- no Our waiter never came to ask how the meal was if we needed anything etc. instead he was flirting with the table next to us the whole time. I get it you see pretty girls you want to chat them up, but still do your job. He finally came back to take our plates away and we expressed that my gf didn't like her linguine so he said no problem he would take it off. We didn't order dessert. Paid and left. Overall it was underwhelming. The apps are good but dinner not so much. I would possible try it again.

They are fried and dressed just right. crispy yet soft on the inside. easy to share.- crispy bao tacos with beef: set of 3. the bread is fried so it's not soft anymore. it was fine. Worth ordering I suppose.- fish tacos: it was fine I think. Honestly can't remember it too well but it wasn't bad. - the scallops: 3 wonderfully seared scallops. The orzo pasta was in a creamy sauce. It was meh- reminded me of pasta salad but it was actually okay. A different base or execution would be nicer- my friend had a froze which was strong enough and fruity enough for her liking.

I had a 10pm reservation on a Friday, which is prime time! They were playing Kings of Leon and Taylor Swift! Snore. I almost fell asleep, then at 11:30, just as we were gunna leave, the music got fun. Not that I was expecting a Beauty and Essex hype club vibe at dinner but the space is so trendy I expected upbeat at all dinner hours on a weekend. Also the food is suuuuuuper mediocre. Got tortilla soup dumplings and scallops. Soup dumplings weren't really soupy and there were 6 tiiiiiiiny dumplings for $16. Scallops ($32) were a bit slimy/rubbery and in a creamy orzo that was really heavy. The heavy fishy creaminess made me a little queasy. Not refined or fresh flavors at all.

5.0,6/11/2018,"They had me at their ""street art meets street food"" concept, but the amazing food and drinks is what keeps me wanting to go back again and again. This is probably my favorite restaurant in New York City. The decor and aesthetic are cool, and the food is delicious. The creative flavor profiles at Vandal never cease to amaze me. While the avocado toast was perfectly toasted and seasoned, the cauliflower tacos and the roasted squash tostadas were the real show stoppers of my most recent visit. The cauliflower tacos are crunchy and loaded with delicious flavors, while the jicama base to the squash tostadas make them one of the  lightest and most delicious treats I have ever eaten. Also ordered by the table was a margarita pizza (tasty but basic), the salmon, a side of haricot verts (a more flavorful take on a basic side), and sweet potato fries (very well seasoned). For desert I ordered the chocolate pudding macaroon while the s'mores pie was also enjoyed by our table. Finally, Sergeant Bell Pepper was my spicy yet delightful drink of the night. While I also tasted the Rio de Frose and Icy Grape, SBP was my favorite cocktail in New York.

Seems like a good vibe until we dealt with Bartender. In the second station.  She gave us first round. No problem.   This is where it gets crazy.  We're standing there and she has her back to us chatting with someone.  We wait more.  And wait.   And wait.   Finally my friend leans over and taps her excuse me we'd like to order.    She turns around and flips out. Screaming. Don't you ever ever ever ever grab me.   Now EVERYONE at the bar looks at each other confused. It wasn't just us waiting it was like 10-15 on that side. She then screams you fucking wait until I turn around.    Wait what?!!! Now if she was offended by the tap which it was. All she had to say is please don't tap me. Ok no problem We spent $1000 to walk in plus the girls we were with bought drinks.  We couldn't get the money back so we moved to the girl in the first station which was super nice.    Way over priced and mind blowing rude.,1,0,0,Omar M.,"Bronx, Bronx, NY",0,2,0

First off, the place is huge and very tastefully decorated. Upstairs has that swanky prohibition 1920s flapper girl sexiness. The event I went to was in the basement, which is downstairs, past a creepy hallway and through unmarked doors. Very cool.The security guy opened the doors and bang, a beautiful long, curvey bar, adorable lounge seating, and a huge downstairs space! The drinks I had were all really good and the little food I ate was tasty (I had some tuna tartare, mini alcoholic milkshakes and onion ring looking churro-like sugary fried dough rings).

I made a reservation and still waited to be sat, after getting seated I was not greeted by our server or even gotten a glass of water for 23 minutes. When she did come to her section she took the complete order from a table that was seated after me. After finally getting her to come over, we weren't given any recommendations or specials. We ordered two drinks and appetizers. Took another 14 minutes to get our oysters, at this point still don't have water, drinks or side plates for our first appetizer. After speaking with the manager, Andre, he said he would be taking care of our first drinks and first appetizer. After checking in, the manager left and the terrible server returned, our next app the soup dumplings sat under the heat lamp too long and came out soggy and gross. The entrees were tasty, I had the aged steak and my girlfriend got the scallops. The service ruined an otherwise pleasurable dinner.

Cause her sandals don't have heels ? Iam sorry but if Iam drinking and dancing I prefer to be in flat shoes so I don't trip or hurt myself it was a FOUL excuse and I think he just didn't want to let us in. It was unprofessional and like I said two ladies before my wife entered with sandals. I don't know if it was a homosexual thing or whatever it was but I just spent on maybe about $350 on a bill next door to you guys and tipped our waiter tremendously if it was about money I would of spent it. As a business owner myself I don't pick and choose who I accommodate I make sure all my customers black, white, short or small or gay and or transexual whatever it is I stick by my rules and procedures at my facility in Jersey and I make sure I have my customers leave with POSITIVE things to talk about and IF I have to bend the rules a bit no problem with maybe talking it out or something but no I felt a bit pushed off right away too quickly that I don't even want to even bother going back and forth with the dude but he completely ruined my wife's birthday just completely cut us off I didn't even bother to really let this guy have it with my response BUT I hope the other two ladies before us had a great time with their sandals and didn't have too much to drink since it was a safety issue lol nice one!",0,0,0,Shantae M.,"Hackensack, NJ",0,9,7

Its your stereotypical trendy New York restaurant/lounge type hybrid. Its got a ton of space, like absurd amount. Its also cool because while you are waiting to be seated there is a ton of open seating in bar area. The drinks were very meh. We got a few different ones. The jalapeno tequila one was good but the tea based one was terrible as was another we tried.Once we were seated service was great. But the food was pretty lackluster. It was a bunch of small dishes, which I get, its nice to try many things. But, it was overpriced and very small. We got like 12-14 for 5 and it really wasnt enough. Would have been one thing if the dishes were $8-14 but they were more like $16-24. Just not economical for the quality. I will say it was nice that they were willing to change the quantity of number of pieces in each dish based on our party. Which is unusual. Good dishes - the rice balls with meat, the tortilla soup dumps (very small tho), the cauliflower tacos were the bombMeh dishes - pizza, lamb meatballs, tartare pretzelsOverall this was probably a one stop shop for me.

The table is sitting empty and they wanted us to wait IN THE STREET. Can you believe this???after an argument we finally got seated ALL WITH ATTITUDE!! We ordered appetizers. The appetizers were interesting but so expensive. Then we ordered 11 main courses. That was where the horror story is. Never order their salmon. Pure garbage. We sent it back. The fish smelled. Then someone ordered the $45 steak. That was so sad to see. A tiny price of dried out meat on a huge bed of risotto. Dried out and of such poor quality. The chicken parmigiana was a small piece of chicken drowned in sauce and cheese. The bone marrow was hysterical.  Absolutely nothing to eat. Well I paid the bill and then went out to eat.

4.0,5/21/2018,Randomly came here at 2am on a Saturday and was pleasantly surprised by this place. So many clubs and bars in New York are tiny and while Vandal is in a basement it's very spacious. It's also a great semi upscale club without the snobby attitude you might get from the crowd at a similar club in Chelsea. The music was GOOD (all hip hop) and my friends and I had a great time dancing. I definitely want to head back here soon as it's so hard to find a nice club that plays hip hop that doesn't make you feel like you have to act or dress a certain way to get in.

You're back up to 5 stars We came here for Sunday Brunch because all the spot we wanted to go for Cinco De Mayo had no available reservations Not that I mind because I've always liked Vandal.Ironically I happened to have the same server. Luckily it wasn't busy during Sunday brunch and he was much more attentive than before. Not that I think he remembered me or anything. LolAnyway Vandal overall is a good experience... from the decor to the drinks to the food. All was aligned in the stars today!!!I started at the bar because my friends were tardy as usual lol .  The girl bartender was friendly and let me try the frozen Rio de Frosé which is like a frozen Rosé cocktail. Now I am not a big rosé girl at all and in the past my cocktails at Vandal have been ok.  But for some reason - this cocktail made my day!!! This cocktail was pretty and was delicious... so good we had 3 or 4 each  by the end of the meal!!!  My favorite cocktail  at Vandal. As for food - this place is a sharing place (which I love)  cuz I like to try several things to enjoy with others!! We had the crispy cauliflower tacos!!! BANGIN!!! So good!  We also had the braised chicken tacos  which I did not enjoy. We had the prime skirt stalest fried rice which was also very good!!!!  BUT our favorite was the wild mushroom pizza - SOOO yummy we ordered TWO!! I've had this before so I already knew... but damnit it's so darn good. There is Parmesan and cracked red pepper on the side that you could sprinkle.

1.0,5/5/2018,I went to Vandal lounge last night. The bouncer requested that in order to get in there was a minimum of 75$ tab. I'm almost sure that this tab wasn't required for everybody. So in order to get in I had to give my credit card and drivers license to the promoter. (There were to men at the door a promoter guy and a bouncer) This guy walks me down to the bar and hands my card and id to the bartender which charged my card 75 plus 18% gratuity.Trust me the money wasn't the issue. The thirst of the venue is the problem for me. The thirst to get people to buy 3 to 4 drinks which equals about 75$ is the issue. Very tacky the whole situation. To be escorted to the bar with this man holding me id and credit card to make sure that I'm charge me a upfront fee. I'm truly disgusted.I already had 2 drinks upstairs at the vandal restaurant so why would I need so much drinks down stairs at the lounge.Is the place not making sales. The lounge honestly was not even that crowded. Honestly the place was ok. I just would never go back because of the forced 75$ minimum nonsense. If it wasn't for that I could have spent more.

3.0,5/1/2018,"I came here the past weekend after dinner with friends for my bachelorette weekend since the initial Vegas plans were foiled in March due to the crazy snow storms. We wanted to go to check out the club area that was separate entrance from the restaurant/ bar, but it was too rainy for us to wait outside on line and get soaked in rainwater. Instead we decided to check out the bar to just grab drinks. Vandal has a real artsy look to the decor of the place with lots of interesting paintings, a giant bunny statue and a very industrial feel on this side of the venue. The bar was packed around 12am, but eventually we were able to hang by the bar to grab some drinks. The drinks were not the best I've had in the city, but for $17 cocktails I'd expect much better. My friend and I felt that a couple of the cocktails we ordered didn't have enough of one element or another to make the drink perfect. The staff was nice enough to fix it though if we didn't like how it was prepared. There are couches opposite of the bar available to sit, however they require you to open a tab to sit there. Eventually we moved there for more room. Our waitress for the table service was very nice and made sure we liked our mixed drinks and had enough water in our glasses. When we ordered shots, she had them brought on a cute pink stand which was impressive.Lots of people used this boomerang photo booth they had in an area between the bar and the other side of the restaurant. It's a cute idea, except the placement of the booth can cause some traffic jam when the bar is busier and a bigger group is using it. Overall it was and okay experience here.

The drink options at the bar just wasn't the best as well so we ended up taking a lot of shots to make up for it. The music, the crowd, everything just wasn't for us although we tried to make a good time. Everything else about the venue was gorgeous.

Everyone wants to take pictures with the purple breakdancing bunny statue which is located right at the entrance/exit so getting a picture on a busy night is a difficult thing to do. The cheesy parmesan chicken was delicious!!!! The music is the best part of this experience. R&B and hip hop and it's loud. The drinks are pretty pricey at $17+ per drink and not very large either. I would recommend going for drinks elsewhere. I did enjoy my experience I just wish I had gotten a picture with the bunny and that my feet hadn't died.

We ordered four small dishes between the two of us: sea bass tacos, mushroom pizza, miso eggplant, and the tortilla soup dumplings. The pizza and the dumplings were amazing, the tacos were standard and the miso eggplant sort of didn't fit. We finished with reese's pieces pops and churros.

1.0,4/20/2018,"First off, I live in Manhattan and love Beauty & Essex, so I'm not some tourist who is shocked by New York prices or something. My friend made a reservation for his birthday for 8pm on a Friday for eight people. Of those eight, six were bankers, one was a hedge fund guy, and one (myself) was a lawyer. Needless to say, we all have very busy and unpredictable schedules. I was the first to arrive at 7:57. I walked up, gave the name of my party, and was told that since I was the first to arrive I should wait and let them know when everyone else got there. I was not directed to a coat check, nor was I directed to the bar. Around 8:05, my friend texted me saying that he was stuck in traffic with one friend, two people were stuck on calls with clients and couldn't make it, and the rest were stuck at the office but were leaving soon. He said he had just called the restaurant, had explained the situation, and had been told that they would essentially push his reservation back to 8:30, when everyone thought they would be there. By 8:35, five of us were there; the sixth was on his way after escaping the office. My friend told the hostess, who said it wasn't a problem. Less than five minutes later, my friend went up and informed them that everyone was here, but one was stuck outside on a call. The hostess then informed him that the table was gone because it had only been held until 8:15, but that we could be seated downstairs. She said downstairs was exactly the same except that there were couches instead of chairs. Turns out that was a lie, you can't order food there. We went back upstairs and were told that we could wait for them to work us in. We said fine, and went to the bar to wait. Fast forward. My friend asked if we would be seated within the hour. The hostess then said she had no idea and could not guarantee that we would be seated before midnight since all the tables were taken by reservations. A few unpleasant rounds of discussion ensued. Pretty soon, my friend is speaking to the manager. We were then seated within 10 minutes. After waiting about 15 more, our waitress walked up.We ordered drinks, and I ordered their sweet potato fries so we'd have something to snack on while we perused the menu. As we were all pretty hungry, the plan was to get two different appetizers, knowing we'd need to get two orders of each to have enough for everyone, and then have everyone order their own entree. The waitress informed us that instead we should order 4-5 orders of appetizers and two entrees since the entrees are family style. It seemed odd advice, but I foolishly said nothing. We ordered two orders of tacos, two orders of the buns, and one order of the pizza special to start. We then ordered the tortellini and chicken parm. We were told that would be enough for the table. The tacos and buns were great. The pizza was mediocre at best. Then the entrees came out and I almost laughed. The chicken parm dish was about half the size of the chicken parm at Parm that is meant for one person, and the tortellini dish had a whole six regular sized tortellini on it. This was certainly not enough food for five men and one woman (myself). Our waitress checked in right as the food arrived, but assuming she would check in again so we could order more, I didn't suggest placing another order. The tortellini was fine, not exceptional, and I didn't even try the chicken because there was so little left after two of the guys had served themselves about as much as a Hollywood starlet on a diet would eat. Before the last of the chicken parm was finished, our plates and utensils were cleared. About five minutes later, our waitress asked if we wanted to order more food. Everyone was still hungry, so we took the menu back to look. We decided to order another chicken parm and pizza, but by the time the waitress came back it had taken so long that we just decided to scratch that idea. Ten minutes later, a birthday cupcake was brought out to my friend. It literally looked like they had bought it from the local Gristedes. Not exactly a stellar ending. As we walked out, I could see two large empty tables, one of which had been empty for almost our entire meal, and one smaller empty table just in the very front of our section of the restaurant. The food bill (after taking out drinks) was about $50 a person including tax and standard tip. Had we ordered as we had planned rather than how we were told to, the bill would actually have been larger. We didn't spend nearly as much as we planned, mostly because we just wanted it all to be over. Had the few bites of food I got been really good, I would have been satisfied, but they weren't at all. Add that to the mediocre service and rude hostess, and you have a pretty disappointing night.

4.0,4/17/2018,"Note: this review is more for the nightclub/evening scene rather than the food/upstairs restaurant, although I have had the opportunity to try a number of dishes here as well. I usually come to Vandal on Fridays around 10:30-11:00 or so and it always gets decently busy without having the ultra-packed, obnoxious vibe of what I would consider to be the true nightclubs in the city (Marquee, Up & Down, Tao, 1 Oak, etc). Vandal has more of a loungey feel earlier in the night, with a really solid DJ that always plays a fun mix of Top 40s hip-hop and older classics that everyone knows. The demographics are a little more varied/multifarious than the aforementioned nightclubs as well - a good number of yuppies in their mid 20s, lots of European tourists, and a solid representation from the 30s-age professional crowd too. The food is, well, still ""club"" food, but again - a much higher caliber than that of its comrades. Those brisket tacos or whatever they call them are to die for, the pizza is solid, and the bao buns are yummy as well. That being said, I don't think I would go for the food completely disparate from the downstairs atmosphere.The whole theme of Vandal is street food/street art, which means that like Tao (which I recently found out is a relative), a number of NYC-based street artists have work up. Think Shepard Fairey, Hush, Tristan Eaton, etc. I can guarantee not everyone appreciates it, but as a patron it's really cool to see. All in all, the food is fine, but I really come to Vandal for the great music, great crowd, and slightly classier/tamer atmosphere than some of the bigger, more aggressive clubs in the city. It's hard to strike a nice balance and Vandal somehow manages. Also note: the cocktails are surprisingly good/inventive for a place that probably makes most of its money selling vodka sodas.",3,0,2,Hannah M.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",1025,331,1186

To plate a 6 inch cake and son happy birthday. That's 3 times more expensive than the actual cake was worth lol Food took really long to come, they serve it ""family style"" with the whole table which means you all have to share the food with eachother but it was never enough. We had to complain twice. Seemed like they were trying hard to avoid bringing food. So example they brought us 4 mini pizzas to share between 20 adults... really?

We have a reservation for 10:00pm on a Friday and were not seated until 10:30. What's the point of a reservation if I have to wait 30 minutes to sit?

1.0,4/8/2018,"We decided to celebrate our friends' birthdays at Vandal last night. Drinks were good, food was okay - nothing to wax poetic about. Our waitress was competent.After dinner, around 12:30 am,  we decided to make our way to the lounge. We were told that we had to go outside and join the queue.There were less than ten people in line when we reached the door. They were all white. All members of our merry party were black. All the people in front of us were let in after the bouncer requested their Ids. No mention of a compulsory bar tab or table buy. Our turn- the bouncer asked how large our party was. There were 7 of us. 3 girls and 3 guys. Note that the group before us had a similar composition. The promoter/ person in charge of tables ( whatever your call these club going rainmakers) requested that our party either purchase a table with a $600 minimum or spends at least $50/person. We declined both offers. No other party before, and we will later witness later, were requested to make spend a minimum amount.We were shocked and annoyed as we had just spent $700+ at dinner, at that same establishment.We decide to wait on the side to see if our suspicions would be confirmed. After 15 very uncomfortable minutes waiting next to the bouncer, he finally broke. He let in a group of white people with only one request ""Ids please"". No minimum spend request.  When questioned on his decision, the bouncer explained that ""entrance his granted at the bouncer's discretion"". Ha!The kicker after about 10 people were let in with no minimum spend request- Rainmaker guy (obvi white) asked if we wanted to buy a table or proceed with a minimum bar tab. This was an example of overt racism and discriminatory door policies. We were treated as second zone party goers/ citizens and were expected to be let in at a higher premium than fellow white patrons. The sad part- a black man with the help of his white boss enforced it.

3.0,4/8/2018,"To start this is 3.5 star review, a 3 is a bit harsh but I really don't think it deserved a 4. Scott Conant's (judge from Chopped) Vandal is a shining example of restaurant aesthetic. The whole space(and it's a large space) is expertly designed with art on every wall. The food is an innovative melting pot with a strong emphasis on tapas style sharing. The menu blends Asian, Mexican, American cuisine in a fun way. But what they excel at in terms of creativity, they lack a bit in execution.  I'll start with the positives. If you take one thing from this review, let it be this: DO NOT, I repeat, DO NOT SLEEP ON THE EGGPLANT. This side dish of deep fried cubes of eggplant, crackly crisp on the outside and creamy on the inside, swimming in a flavorful miso saucy glaze was one of the best things I've put in my mouth in years. My second favorite item was the sticky rice dumplings stuffed with char sui pork- this was delicious. This was like the Asian answer to arancini. Crispy on the outside, soft, sticky and porky on the inside with sweet soy and chill oil for dipping.Beyond these two exceptional plates, I found many of the other dishes great in concept but not delivering in terms of flavor. There was a noticeable theme of under-seasoning and heavy bites screaming for a strong hit of acid. This left me wanting more as the flavors were a bit muted. Dishes falling under this included: -Broccoli and cheese soup dumplings- good but the flavors were muted-Crispy bao buns- like an Asian taco filled with brisket and a crunchy Asian slaw- the bao buns hold the oil flavor a bit too strongly and the slaw really needed more acid to cut through that-Short rib tacos- tender short rib, but again cherry tomato salsa really needed more acidity or maybe some spice to wake it up-Caesar salad- just sort of fine, pretty basic Caesar. Needed more seasoning, but the Parmesan crunchies were good-NY Pretzel steak tartar- interesting concept, tartar with some crunchy pretzels mixed in, sitting atop a soft pretzel. It had some pickled mustard seeds but this again needed better seasoning and more pickled mustard seedsOverall, this place has a lot of potential. With some tweaks in execution this could be phenomenal food. As is there is some definite room for improvement. Despite some lackluster dishes, I'd go again for the eggplant alone.",4,1,0,Taylor P.,"Mays Landing, NJ",183,101,226

If you know NY, trains are either delayed or in the weekends they have weird lines not running etc. And if you're driving in there is always traffic or no parking. Anyway, drinks were extremely expensive, they were average. I ordered the cauliflower tacos, which were delicious, but you're basically paying $14 to fill up not even 1/3 of your belly. My cousin ordered he $55 dollar steak, which she said was just OK. Another girl ordered the chicken parm, which is just a piece of chicken with no sides.

5.0,3/11/2018,"Came here w a group of 20 on a Saturday night to celebrate a friend's birthday. Entire place was packed, mostly with other  groups, and loud but could hear the person next to me. Restaurant is beautifully and stylishly decorated. Friends had developed with the restaurant a custom prix fixe menu in advance for our group, and our waitress kindly asked each of us about allergies before the meal began. We ate many courses, and every single dish I tried was delicious. I especially appreciated being treated like a queen by being accommodated for the three types of food I don't eat. Each time something on the prix fixe menu had one of those ingredients, the waitress let me know AND brought an alternative dish, which was always outstanding. I've never had my food issues been so accommodated, and it wasn't even my birthday. And they were doing this -- managing various allergies -- for multiple people in our party. Really amazing service, plus delicious food in a gorgeous and fun setting.",1,0,0,Ellen W.,"New York, NY",84,57,14

The appetizers were amazing. The sticky rice dumplings were the best, followed by the margarita pizza, the tacos, the broccoli cheddar dumplings, and lastly the bao buns. The entrees were equally good. From best to worst, the steak, the scallops (cooked very well) , the chicken parm, the  ravioli and lastly the tortellini.

The place is beautiful and I went with a party of 5. The problem was I found that they double charged my credit card. I called Vandal and they can't help you over the phone. They said I have to email them. I thought that was a bit strange but emailed them twice and this was going on 2 weeks now and never heard back. I had to contact my credit card company and file a dispute. This really did ruin am otherwise nice experience. Not sure if we will return now.,0,0,0,Nick M.,"Stony Brook, NY",1,8,10

This time, however, the place was dead (Winter Storm Quinn likely to blame) and the food was...okay. But most upsetting was our waiter, who approached us all cheery for the first course and 2nd round of drinks, but stood around angrily and literally stormed away from our table when we didn't order more than that. Let me reiterate - the place was DEAD - he wasn't busy w/other tables nor did he need us to hurry up so other diners could sit down.

I do have to admit it was beautiful and like everyone said.. trendy. The place was dark and the music was loud. There was cool wall art and the service was top notch. We ordered to share:- Sea bass tacos: The fish itself was good but it was heavily covered in coleslaw which was not needed. It had a little spicy kick. - Wild mushroom pizza: Thin, not dry, nice ingredients but it was bland. The cheese was salty without any other flavor. I got bored after one slice. - Skirt steak with thai fried rice: The steak came medium rare. It was extremely juicy and moist as if they soaked it in butter. The fried rice was greasy and salty. It left us so thirsty. In my opinion the food was overpriced and mediocre. Dining here is more of a experience. I definitely had fun. I highly recommend checking out the lounge downstairs. It seems closed off but it is open to anyone over 21. After the stairs, you go through a quiet hallway and into a mysterious door that took me a while to find. From there you enter into another world. The bar was gorgeous, spacious, clean and high end. Around 9pm it was empty and a lot quieter than the dining area.

We did come here Friday 5 to 6 p.m. we were seated where it was super quiet and no music it was so awkward and then we walk over to take pictures and their booth we saw that there were more people with music in the area we were just jealous we didn't get the same experience so maybe I'll give Vandal another shot another time.,0,0,0,Emily V.,"WOODHAVEN, NY",77,10,9

We were really pleased by everything from the very welcoming hostess, breath taking décor, as well as wonderful food we left the restaurant that night with the biggest smiles on our face. For appetizers we shared the short-ribbed tacos and the crispy bao buns both appetizers were great. For our main course we shared the 50-day aged 36 oz Tomahawk ribeye which cooked perfectly.

But it was fine because we indulged in $17 drinks to keep us preoccupied. We were finally seated in a very large booth room enough for 6 of us. We were immediately greeted by our waitress even though they were slim she was very friendly and knowledgeable of the menu. Tbh I was shocked at the amount of stuff on the menu considering previous pictures and reviews only showed the same 4-5 items. Plus I figured people only came to vandal to drink and nosh.Anyway I ended up ordering the scallops after I saw the size of them. The woman behind me had them and they were huge! They come with a creamy orzo and corn mixture the dish was absolutely delicious.My best friend ordered the salmon with pearl couscous it was delicious as well. The only complaint for my table was that they couldn't split our meals and at the end of our dinner everyone was trying to pay with a card and they only except up to 3 cards, which makes sense as to not over complicate things.

We didn't get a drink other than champagne bottle so I can't attest to the drink reviews. It was the perfect volume level. We had no problem hearing one another, which was awesome for a place you thought you would. I have three issues with the place;-I wish the appetizers were 4 a plate not 3 a plate. It's hard to share HALF a small taco. -The other issue was the chicken parm did not come with any spaghetti, which would have been awesome to have together--but I guess it worked out because then I was able to finish the MASSIVE portion it was.-The ravioli portion size was 6 raviolis. NOTHING in comparison to the chicken parmesan size. I don't like places that cannot keep consistency between entree portions.

After midnight the lower level lounge gets packed, and rightly so...the music is very dance-worthy :)The menu is a crowd pleaser, with dishes across cuisines - sashimi, dumplings, tacos, pasta, pizza, etc., etc. Everything we ordered was fine, but nothing registered as either amazing or below par - so no dishes to call out here.All in all, don't expect culinary greatness....and Vandal can be a super fun night!",0,0,0,Sargam M.,"Manhattan, NY",81,163,0

The walls have massive paintings that are just amazing art pieces. One crazy thing that bothered me was that the restrooms have attendants who are basically there to be tipped. I am okay if that was just for the lounge because it's something typical at other places, but I feel it's not necessary for the restaurant area, especially if there are families taking their kids there.

Imaginative shawarma salad and poke bowl I would eat every day if possible. Food presentation was nicely done although askew or tilted by table service. Big complaint, it's very loud. And the play list is odd for a place that looks so current. It's like Pandora 1980's channel. So, points off for asthmatic. Finally, desert and second round of drinks came only moments before the the check was placed on the table. Sorry guys, it takes us a few minutes to drink the second glass of wine. I guess I could say don't order a second round on a busy night. But the food and the artwork is decent so give it a try.",0,0,0,Andrea M.,"Huntington, NY",2,26,22

4.0,2/7/2018,"My 4 friends and I came here for restaurant week. We were super pumped about it; we're all total foodies and the restaurant week menu looked amazing! We made a reservation for 5 at 7:30. We weren't seated until 7:50, which was very disappointing considering we made a reservation. Four of us ordered an alcoholic beverage, and was delivered quickly. Then we placed our meal orders. Appetizers didn't come out for quite some time. We got the crispy bao buns, sticky rice dumplings, and the poke bowl. Each of us loved our chosen appetizers. Other than one of us who felt the salmon wasn't cooked to her satisfaction, dinner was overall pretty good. Four of us got the pan roasted salmon and one got the prime skirt steak. While the meals were delicious, we weren't done with dinner until about 9:45pm, and we still needed to get dessert. Needless to say, the service was exceptionally slow.My friend had grabbed the managers' attention to let him know our disappointment of not being seated until 20-25 minutes after our reservation time and the crazy long periods of time between receiving meals. He was extremely apologetic, and immediately offered us a free bottle of champagne and private table in their club downstairs. We were pleasantly surprised by his attentiveness, so we gladly agreed.We then received the bill, and it was incorrect--listing 5 drinks instead of 4 (a big deal in NYC when the drinks are $17+). Sent the check back. After a bit, the waiter returned with another check--and again it was wrong, listing the skirt steak as the regular entrée price of $45 (which, btw, most definitely is NOT worth spending $45 on a regular day. It was good but not THAT good) instead of the $42 restaurant menu price. Send the check back again, now for the second time. The manager saw that we were a little frustrated at this point so he came over again. I asked how much the bottle of champagne was, he said $65--then I asked if he could just take that $$ off of the bill instead of providing us with the bottle of champagne, because we were now so frustrated by the disorganization that we really just wanted to leave. He totally understood, apologized profusely and took the check back to personally take care of the situation.The manager returned to our table and gave me the check. He took more money off of our bill than the bottle of champagne was even worth, which was a VERY nice surprise. Then, to top it off, he gave us an entire platter of desserts (instead of just the one dessert the restaurant week menu came with), and he said that he felt so bad about the impression the restaurant made that he wanted to make it up to us, and still offered the champagne and private table. There are a lot of ways this night could have gone, and the manager really turned the night around and gave us an excellent experience. Though our dining experience was not the best, the customer service was EXCEPTIONAL and most definitely made up for it. I am happy to write them a positive review and will still recommend this restaurant to friends and family.On top of it all- the décor of the place is incredible :).

4.0,2/6/2018,"Food - 3.5Had the bone marrow, it was decent , not much on a Flavor. My personal opinion - missing salt at least . Bao bunny was good- good flavor, nice and juicy. Tortilla dumpling soup was much enjoyable and great combination of pozzole broth and poblano cheese. Shrimp tempura roll - nothing special at all. Steak tartare pretzel my less favorite - creative idea but no flavor at all. New York strip - steak not well seasoned ( if its a good  quality steak , you don't need much seasoning ) quality of this steak was just average. Seared scallops, was actually seared to perfection. Service-5  I believe our server name was Christian. Service was attentive, perfectly explained the dishes and give us some recommendations. Not pushy at all ( like at some fine dining restaurants) , not rushing us out . Made a good surprise on my friends BDAY. Amazing friendly hostesses . Upon your arrival they great you with a smile .

However they added on 7% admin fee and 18% gratuity to the bill which is why this place is such a rip off and steals from people. Tips for a mixed drink that takes literally 15 seconds to make should be a dollar or two. 7% admin fee? Admin for what? Dont get ripped off here.

4.0,2/6/2018,"I came to Vandal during restaurant week, and definitely had a good experience.I had heard this place is a nightlife location and gets packed on the weekends, so i was interested to see how their dinner service would be on a week night.It is an extremely large location, plenty of room for sitting at a table for some privacy, or standing in the bar area with others. I came with four people and we were seated right away.The restaurant week menu was great. They had a lot of options, which for restaurant week i was expecting the menu to be a little bit more on the limited side. I had the Bao Buns, Skirt steak, and the Churros.The Bao Buns were the best thing out of the three by far. Crispy but soft buns with a lot of different flavors and textures. Truly a great dish, and from what the server said, one of the best things they have. The skirt steak was served over Thai fried rice and also had a fried egg on top. The steak was cooked perfectly, as it is easy to over cook a skirt steak. There were a lot of asian inspired flavors to the dish, i would defiantly recommend it if you are in the mood to try something a little different. The Churros was the dish the surprised me the most. They were served with a very spicy chocolate sauce. I had no idea it was spicy so when i tried it i was expecting simply a chocolate sauce. Be aware!The drinks here are expensive, as is the dinner menu, so if you are coming here expect to spend $15-20 per cocktail. My old fashioned cost $20.",2,1,1,Ross H.,"New York, NY",362,105,436

The food was excellent and we did not find ourselves rushed. It's very loud so if you are going there on a date to have a romantic conversation or just catch up with friends, that probably not going to happen.The place draws a lot of people and the crowd is very young for the most part. We had a table of 8 teenagers next to us. I don't know if I would go back as I can get food that is just as good or better in so many places. We had a bottle of wine and sampled a few appetizers.  We had the snapper tostada's, chilean sea bass tacos, short rib tacos, lobster sopes, dumplings and the shrimp tempura. We shared the main courses which was the halibut, salmon, and skirt steak. For sides we had the polenta and eggplant. There was no disappointment with food or service although the beginning and end of the night can be a little hectic.

2.0,2/4/2018,"I had such high expectations for this place.. I've seen pictures online and heard about the wonderful ambiance/art decor. So it only seemed fitting that my boyfriend and I came to try it for the beloved restaurant week. I had the sticky rice balls (appetizer), the old school chicken Parmesan (main) and churros (dessert); my boyfriend had the salmon/poke bowl (appetizer), grilled steak (main) and the Jameson milkshake shot (dessert). The food was a little below average and overall seemed to need more seasoning. The cocktails are in the 17$ range and are served in pretty small glasses. The best thing I ate here were the churros which were pretty good. In a nutshell, the portion are small, overpriced, and leave you desiring something more.. despite the talked about art decor/ambiance, it's not somewhere I would be visiting again Ps.

4.0,1/30/2018,"Came for the restaurant week menu a few days ago and it was pretty good! Atmosphere is definitely super trendy, I'm glad I wore my going out clothes because everybody was dressed to head out after it seemed. It was crazy crowded and we weren't seated until about 40 mins after our reservation time. Not the biggest deal but it seems a bit rude that we weren't offered a drink because of the wait (cocktails are around $18 so it wasn't like we were chilling in the bar before our table was ready), instead we just stood around in the lobby, which was packed. Service was okay, if a bit inconsistent. Our waiter came over right away to explain things, but he seemed to be pushing the cocktails a bit too much. We ordered and it took forever for the apps to come. And then again for the mains. It just seemed odd, you'd think they'd be making the restaurant week options constantly because that's what most people are there for, so there shouldn't be a long wait for them. Multiple times we were given plates for the apps only to have them taken away before they ever came, and when we pointed out we'd need them it took forever to get them back. The food was really good though. We shared the bao and sticky rice dumplings, both excellent. My main of flank steak over fried rice was delicious, cooked to perfection. For dessert we had the churros, which were good but the chocolate sauce they came with had a weird spice to it and it left me wishing I had normal chocolate to dip in.

I had the skirt steak with egg and chinese sausage fried rice. I liked the skirt steak, it was seasoned just right.  I was a little on the fence about the rice though as i was expecting it to have pieces of sausage (it did not), and It was sweet in flavor, didn't taste like fried rice. It was ok though. Finally, for desert  had vanilla panna cota and someone else in my table jad the churros. Both were good, some people didn't like the chili in the chocolate sauce accompanying the churros, but i loved it.

2.0,1/12/2018,"Went here for my 21st Birthday on a Sunday evening. The atmosphere was very cool; I loved seeing all the artwork around and the setup of the restaurants (there are many different rooms/sections) was very unique. I was very disappointed by the music however, which was a majority of outdated music. I expected to hear club music (deep house/tech house) like at their affiliate TAO Uptown or at least current music. The majority of the food we tried was delicious, however small portions (which was expected) and an extremely limited menu (not expected). One thing I enjoyed about their food menu is how diverse it was; you had things from pizza to steak tartare to dumplings to Greek salad. While it was nice to get a flare of many different regions, you were extremely limited to the # of options there were for food. I would like to see Vandal expand the number of food options on their menu while maintaining the diversity in it. Two members of our party tried the coffee (one decaf, one regular) and said it was the absolute worst coffee they have ever tasted. Their (alcoholic) drink menu was very limited as well, at least in the restaurant part (I am not sure if the bar drink menu differs). We brought a cake in and were charged $5 per person for it to be cut. As a group of 4 people, this was manageable, however if it was any more than that it would have been much too expensive. They checked the cake upon bringing it in to make sure it was not damaged (so they would not be held liable, which I understand) yet when the Cake was brought out, the writing on the Cake board that said ""Happy Birthday"" was smudged by the ""d"" in ""Birthday"". I have not had the chance to call about this due to working all week but I am very upset about this for I payed hundreds of dollars only to be charged 20 and have smeared writing in all of my pictures. I have picture proof of this too. All in all, I most likely would not come back here. I would maybe come for drinks and a light meal if invited by a friend, but I would not initiate a dinner here and certainly not come for a birthday to get my cake damaged. If I did return, I would like to see it on a Friday or Saturday night as opposed to a Sunday evening, solely to see if the music was different.",0,0,0,Alexis M.,"Westwood, NJ",479,9,0
1.0,1/7/2018,"I've been meaning to leave a review about my experience at Vandal. Let's start with the good: music is great. the vibe is chill. However, now with the bad....the very bad: i went with a group of about 12 women for a bachelorette. The cocktail servers and their help have a scam going on. I'm not sure if it's fueled by management or if they are doing this on their own. the woman and I decided to get a table and two bottles for the evening so that we could have a place to sit and be more comfortable. Two bottles lasted us like an hour and a half and we don't drink that fast. First off, they are very eager to serve you and ANYONE around you drinks from your bottle. Second, if you put your drink down on the table for any reason, the servers' helpers or bus boys were coming around and swiping any and all drinks (whether completely filled to the rim or completely empty --- but mostly they were ALL filled to the rim) from the table and forcing you to pour another drink. Needless to say they were pushing u off the tables so that they can seat another group and make more money. Also, the place gets ridiculously crowded and it turns into an oven in there. I was very disappointed and upset with the whole experience and I'm not easily disappointed. If you decide to go to the lounge, don't buy bottles. You're better off spending your money with drinks at the bar. I'll never go back. Thanks for nothing.",1,0,0,Debbie V.,"Miami, FL",41,50,77

Picky eaters and foodies alike will be satisfied with the menu. My Autumn Sakura cocktail was beautifully simple and yummy. Service was wonderful; we noticed that our water glasses were never empty, and the staff is happy to give recommendations.The lounge has a heated indoor waiting area which is a huge perk in this bitter NY winter! The bouncers were courteous and coat check was complimentary. VIP service in the lounge was comfortable and not cramped. There were always fresh glasses for us.

We had to wait on one more guest to arrive so we decided to sit in the room near the entrance. While waiting, I asked the doorman, nicely, what time did they close, he responded in an extremely angry tone.

3.0,12/17/2017,"Vandal... Where do I even begin?Oh, I know... my boyfriend made a reservation for dinner for the two of us to celebrate my birthday. We had other people coming later in the night, so we only reserved for the two of us. We were running a bit late because of the traffic and my boyfriend called them, and they gave us an additional 30 minutes to arrive. They stated that if we did not arrive within 30 minutes of our reservations, it would be cancelled. When we arrived, we made it about 32 minutes late. We went up to the hostess, and she gave us a buzzer. Our reservation was not cancelled; awesome! The buzzer rang within like the first ten minutes! While waiting, I wanted to get a picture with the famous bunny, but there were people blocking it as they also waited for their reservations.Okay, so once the buzzer started blinking red, we went to the hostess and were seated. We ordered our food and I was not flattered. We had Crispy Bao Buns, which were good. We also had a Margherita Pizza; this pizza was fresh... but it was flat and nothing special. My boyfriend had the Old School Chicken Parm, which was the best plate of the night; my only problem with this dish is that it did not come with any pasta or garlic bread... The size of this plate was nice! I had the Big Sexy Burger, and no, I am not saying that it is big and sexy; that is actually the name. I do not know why they named the plate that, if there is nothing big or sexy about the burger. It was actually very small, but it did have two patties. This burger brought fries... sweat potato fries. When I requested for it to be changed, I was told that sweet potato fries is all they carry... and then on top of that, the fries were soggy and not crispy; YUCK! My boyfriend had the Icy Grapes, and as he got more, they got stronger.  Okay, so I forgot to mention earlier that my boyfriend had told them at the beginning that it was my birthday and he wanted them to bring out a cake... so once we were finished, the waitress asks if we want dessert, and he said that he wanted the cake he had requested at first; this girl caught an attitude for like no reason. Her entire demeanor changed.Okay, so once we were done with everything, we left... we are not the type of  people who stay sitting for hours after they finish eating, taking up space. Once we were outside, we received the call, that the other people were arriving. So once they came, they stated that they wanted to eat too, hahaha! So back inside we go. My boyfriend goes to the original hostess we saw, and asks if we can get a table. He was told that we could get a table downstairs, in the lounge if we put down a specific amount and get a bottle... this did not include what my boyfriend and I had already spent on dinner. If you read through the reviews, you can see how difficult it is to get to the lounge, so we did it.When we got to the lounge, there was a bunch of people sitting down, with nothing on their tables. We were about to get seated in like a small two person sofa, and I looked at my boyfriend confused... how were we going to all fit? So of course, my boyfriend said something and they offered us a nice booth, where there were three girls, doing absolutely nothing, with no bottle or food on the table. They really bumped them to give us that booth... and it was worth it. The food in the lounge was even worse... the pizza downstairs was not fresh.. it was cold. The shrimp mofongos were tiny... I wish I had taken a picture! I am not exaggerating when I say that they were the size of like a half dollar coin! the Moet was the best thing of the night, hahaha. You know they cannot mess that up!The food was mediocre, but it was so much fun... gratuity was included on the receipt, so that waiter had a very nice tip! Oh, we also requested that they put a bachata, and they did not. At first the music was whack.. then, they switched it up a bit and put reggae and all that!** From reading other reviews, I noticed that a lot of people were complaining about the customer service... that was not my case!

3.0,12/15/2017,"Well I said I'd never go back to another place owned by the Tao group after one of their locations treated me and my company really, really badly. But that same company chose this venue for our annual Christmas party so...who am I to turn down a good time?To their credit, our servers went above and beyond to make sure we always had drinks and anything else we needed. Servers were encouraging us to dance, taking our phones for photos, really doing a great job of us making feel welcomed. The hospitality was on point, so good on them.The environment is just not for me. They did play a good amount of 90's dance-able throwback music, so if you want to dance during dinner, this is the place. People get up from their seats to dance in the general vicinity of their tables. There were many 23 year old's from different states who gush about how incredible and amazzzzzing New York is. The place is decorated to look good in your selfie, so go ahead and take shameless advantage. The signature cocktails were downright undrinkable at points, I tried four different mixed drinks before switching to beer. The vegetarian stuff particularly rubbed me the wrong way, but even the tacos and the lobster mac n cheese all felt like poor attempts at what an outer-borough Irish pub might serve if they were trying to cash in on high end gimmicky food trends, but without the greasy spoon charm. Harsh? Maybe, but you're not here for the food. If you do want something solid, invest in the seafood tower. Raw oysters, shrimp, and lobster were delicious.It's an overpriced playpen for people who aren't from here, and it's highly successful at being what it is.

We then requested a new waiter. She was just as bad. Extremely rude - she clearly didn't like her job and we could tell she did not want to wait our table. it took a talk with the manager and 3 waiters to get it together.

4.0,12/11/2017,"I've been to Vandal a couple times, and despite the vibes you might get when you first step in - you'll probably either love the place or think it is way too hipster / trendy for your tastes - I would keep an open mind. The bar upstairs is a bit on the crowded side, but there is a surprising amount of seating in the upstairs restaurant area - the front has a decent amount of space (as well as higher ceilings - helps to mitigate the noise), as well as a dining area in the back that is closer quarters and can be pretty loud. With lots of artwork adorning the walls, it's easy to simply get lost admiring (or trying to understand) the decorative sensibilities, but it has always been an interesting spot to sit down for a meal. Service on balance tends to be quite good (they will come around for drinks frequently, although when they tried to jam a large party I was a part of at a small round table - and deconstructing our original table in the process - that was one of the more puzzling misreads of a situation I have seen anywhere.The food is probably best described as more adventurous contemporary American, but it is very good in its own right, with the entrees being more of the standout. The squash tostadas were a seasonally-oriented vegetarian take on a Mexican dish, with the crunchy jicama shell providing more of a spring-like freshness to the bite. I would say I enjoyed the steak tartare served on a pretzel more; given that the beef was more muted in flavor, it melded in with the pretzel quite well, with the latter providing a dash of saltiness. I will say that I really enjoyed the crispy bao bunds a lot more, though, with it being one of my favorite bites of the evening. With juicy slabs of brisket crisped on the outside, combined with the slightly crunchy bao bun itself (it's not the typically soft bun), it's a delicious, slightly crackling take on an Asian favorite. Next up was a margherita pizza, which was probably the most banal bite of the meal - I could find more interesting pizzas virtually anywhere else...not much to say about that one. The entrees, though, were fantastic. The lobster mac and cheese was definitely on the thicker / heartier side of the spectrum, but there were generous lumps of lobster meat in each bite, and the heavier version of this - meant to imitate lobster bisque drenched over macaroni pasta - was excellent. The pan-roasted salmon was even better, though, with a citrus glaze giving it a bit of sweetness, while it was also topped off with some spices as well. It was cooked a bit more than I generally prefer, but the flavor profile was excellent. Nothing can touch how good the steak is, though. Served atop a fried egg on a bunch of fried rice, the cut of steak is juicy and succulent and worthy really of being on its own (the fried rice was unremarkable filler, IMO). We finished off with some creative desserts. I liked the pretzel-shaped churros better given how generously they were sprinkled with cinnamon and brown sugar, but the Reese's Pieces pops were spot-on impressions of the popular candy (albeit too peanut buttery for usual consumption).As for the drinks side - the cocktails here are delicious, although I did have one Taxi Line that was a bit too bitter. The Icy Grape is dangerously good, given how much it tastes like you are barely boozy grape juice. And the drinking areas? The lounge downstairs is really nice and cozy, although they should really close the upstairs door to prevent cold air from seeping into the lounge at the far end. The dance floor can end up being a lot of fun, and every time I have been there, the DJs are always spinning some solid beats. That said, when it fills up, the service behind the bar can lag a little given that they inexplicably only have 1 or 2 folks working it even though it can get pretty packed.In all - love the vibe and the ambiance, even though I am not the artsy / hipster type, and the food and drinks are quite good, even if the food sometimes errs on the too experimental side.

The place is gigantic and well decorated with unique art and well thought out.   I would expect this from the owners as they own several high end restaurants and clubs around the city.     We had the pleasure of a corner table in the back and had a great view of the whole dining area.    Btw men's bathrooms are to the left and the women's to the right (very clean and well laid out A++).     The menu can be tapas style or solo ordering.    Suggestions the cauliflower tacos get 4 instead of 3 you will want more.  Shishito peppers a must!  Sticky  Pork Rice balls and for the veggi lovers the squash tostadas.  Dinner I recommend the skirt steak you over fried rice you will not stop at 10 bites and the salmon...... please make sure Brussel sprouts and freedom fries for sides.     Dessert the $7 milk shot off the charts and the Greek donuts.Now of course we had one hiccup.... my manhattan had beautiful red lipstick plastered on the edge of the glass.... please note I don't wear lipstick and had to request a new clean lipstick free Manhattan.   Bartenders DYJ and check the glasses.... waitress should ding you on your tip sharing for our table!   Table of 4 4 app 4 entrees 4 desserts and drinks under $100 Pp was well worth the trip!Food: 9.

5.0,11/29/2017,"Talk about a showstopping personally unexpected visit to Vandal on Bowery in lower east side last night. A chic graffiti art style exterior explodes into an amazing breakdancing grape colored glass like bunny entrance. It reminded me of being at a casino in AC, adorned with the most beautiful blown glass art fixtures.Went in towards the bar area for an after work event cocktail and appetizer before returning home. Was acknowledged  pretty quickly by friendly bartenders, which is always great. Note i was there in 8p hour, so I'm sure that helped being after prime time for a weeknight (Monday).Selected to try their 'Spicy Korean Rice Cakes' for it sounded like it would pair well with my drink selection 'The Ritter Spicy Margarita'. It's  made with Casamigos Blanco Tequila (1st time try, as I personally love Don Julio silver.), Cointreau and Jalapeño. The Korean Rice Cakes came out ironcally looking like little bite size Italian gnocchi. They had a slight crispy exterior that lead into a soft/tender center. The sauce wasn't too spicy at all, so don't worry (non-spice lovers)! Personally expected a touch more on heat, but I suppose it was just enough as it indeed paired well with my Jalapeño magarita.Enjoyed experience very much. Would definitely go back to try out more of what appeared to be a diverse menu. Would say definitely a little something for everyone.",0,0,0,Teresa L.,"East Rockaway, NY",55,150,1365

The menu offers various options for picky eaters but also has some interesting pairings. Both times I went, we all ordered different things and just passed them around tapas-style for everyone to try. I don't think anyone had any major problems with their order and the staff was really helpful but everyone really liked the bao buns. Be prepared to spend a decent amount on food and drinks and take a look at the menu before you go. Service can either be a bit slow or a bit pushy/fast as they try to keep each table within their reservations since they allow back-to-back reservations with a short turn-over window. Please make reservations, bc unless it's an early weekday or close to closing hour, walk-in seating would be tough here.

4.0,11/21/2017,"I don't know how I feel about this place. I came here to celebrate a friend's birthday with a group of 8 and although most of the party arrived almost an hour over reservation time (5:30 p.m), we were still very well taken care of and seated without a problem. The staff was very pleasant and attentive. Our waiter was great and made sure that every single thing we needed was taken care of. The thing I liked most about him was his ability to engage in conversation with the whole table, offer us the best desserts, drinks and what his favorite menu item was (for us first timers). I would say for the service alone, Vandal deserves a 4.5/5. The main let down for me was the amount of food for what you pay. I ordered the burger and it just wasn't fulfilling and the salt and vinegar fries were a miss! My suggestion to Vandal would be indicate that the fries are salt and vinegar because had I known that, they def wouldn't have been ordered. The frose (drink) was AMAZING! And I would def recommend it for anyone looking for a good drink on the menu. I didn't hear too many complaints around the table other than the one stated above. "" The portion sizes compared to prices just don't match"". A few items that were ordered consisted of pizza,big sexy burgers, paella, old school chicken parm, tacos, etc... The Vandal video booth is a great addition and def something to visit while here, BUT don't have the video booth right outside the bar and in the way of traffic. While workers are trying to get food to tables, they shouldn't have to constantly be bombarded by individuals taking pictures and videos. I really did like Vandal enough to come back. This just isn't some place I would visit if I were super hungry but rather for a small bite, a drink and some fun. Don't forget to head down to the lounge after your meal for music, drinks and dancing!

My party went outside and they told my husband that it would be 100$ per male but go towards the tab. I thought that was pretty fair. I have seen some comments on here about the minimum being due to race or something Discriminatory.

I'm unbiased and the food was great as well as ambiance, but I feel that unwarrants us being taken advantage of by this bloke due to his racial profiling. No one else had a minimum and the only reason I agreed to it was because of my brother's birthday.

3.0,11/7/2017,"Decided to celebrate my 25th birthday here. Reservation was modified several times by person and time with no issues. Accommodated a party of 6 after we were 15 minutes late, in the meantime waited at the bar purchasing a few drinks. Tabs must be closed before being seated at a table. The bar was extremely uncomfortable and felt very crammed together. Once seated we realized the music level from the bar area did not lower and we found ourselves screaming the entire night. Literally, woke up the next morning without a voice. I just didn't understand why the music was so loud if they do have a lounge next door. The food was AMAZING. Our bill totaled to $458 to be exact and we felt every penny was justified. Two people out of the group are vegans so they stuck to small plates and sides. This didn't amuse the waitress and kind of seemed like they were being punished for their choice. They were told one of their dishes were a side and they had to wait until dinner was served. WHAT? Our waitress had a disgusting attitude. P.s no one asked you to be a waitress, this was your decision. Also, as my friend was taking her 1st bite into her last cauliflower taco another lady with black hair who wasn't our sever and we didn't see the entire night stopped by the table and grabbed her plate form under her while she was eating. She didn't give her a warning or ask her if she was finished. When I spoke up saying ""What the ..."" the lady gave me a devious smile sorta like ""Yeah, and what"" was written across her face. The left my friend eating the rest of her taco in her hand. Poor service! We didn't let these people and their terrible attitudes ruin our night. Also, it may have been super busy but the entire night they were sending out 3 plates at the same time. So when those 3 appetizers were finished they swapped out for another 3 plates etc.. Im not sure if this is the norm here but it left 3 of us staring at the other 3 plates impatiently waiting for ours. NOW. For the good stuff.. The lounge!! Ive read that the lounge picks and chooses who they allow to enter and who has to pay a cover charge and who doesn't. (Literally stand outside for 10 minutes and just watch..)I reached out several days before and received two different responses and I quote ""For a group of 12 people I have two options: A table on the main floor we would require a $3,200 minimum spend, not including taxes or gratuity OR we can do a table by the bar for $2,000 minimum pre tax and gratuity."" From Mr. Art Haliti and again, I quote ""The tables by the bar area are my personal favorite as you co mingle with the action from the bar. For those tables we require a $1.2k minimum spend. The tables on the main floor are considered more premium as they are right on the dance floor in the heart of the party. For those tables we require a $1.8k minimum spend"" From Mr. Bobby Perrson. Once I called out that there was a different price quoted I stopped receiving a response. We met Bobby at the lounge door after watching him let in a group of 4 women without asking about bottle services. I introduced myself and asked about entering the lounge, very rude guy. His entire demeanor read snotty. Either way my guest received champagne bottles and vodka bottles in their favors so we didn't care that much to go to the lounge. For an aspiring restaurant owner and chef. I came here for Chris Santos watching him on food network (Which I watch way too much) I couldn't wait to eat here. The décor is amazing, music is great.

We went on a Wednesday night and it was quite packed. The ambiance is very cool NYC, the rooms are huge and I saw that there were many seating areas, especially for large groups.  We ordered lobster Mac and cheese, the cripsy bao buns, and the pan roasted salmon. First, we assumed because the salmon was a large platter it could be shared for two parties and it was not, I was very disappointed. It too long for them to make it so preferring another platter was not the best decision. It was delicious though. The bao buns is a must order, that as well blew us away. And finally, the Mac and cheese was served on a hot plate which kept the cheese bubbling throughout the meal. Not much lobster for the price $19 but it was good.My ABSOLUTE favorite thing was the dessert.

I was a little hesitent after reading some of the reviews on yelp which said the food was subpar but I really wanted to try this plae and I was glad we did.The restaurant has a really cool vibe. I loved the paintings on the wall in the room we were sitting it. We sat in the front room of the restaurant which had exposed brick and cobblestone floors so I was a little annoyed because the heels of my Louboutins kept getting stuck which kind of ruined my shoes. I would have rather sat in the actually restaurant where it didn't feel like you were sitting in an outside patio but you win some you lose some. I drank the Taxi Line ($17) and it was very good. It tasted like a cucumber margarita. All the cocktail were around the same price but it is expected because this place is owned by the Tao Group so I was prepared to spend a pretty penny. For dinner, we decided to order a bunch of the small items, sides, and 2 entrees to share. It worked out very well. For the small items, we ordered grilled seabass tacos ( I didn't have one but I heard they were good), the shrimp mofongo (they were okay, the shrimp was good but the plantin tasted more like a cake), the chicken tortilla soup dumplings (definitely interesting but not my favorite), and the sticky rice dumplings (which I don't remember what they tasted like aka not memorable). For our large plates we ordered the skirt steak with was delicious and the friend rice is came with was really good! This was probably my favorite thing out of everything!! We also ordered the seared tuna which I did not try but my friends said it was good. For the sides, we ordered the miso soy glazed eggplant which I really enjoyed! I would get again with the skirt steak if I went back. We also ordered the lobster mac & cheese which was so good as well. It was very creamy and the pasta was different shape which I liked. Since it was my birthday they brought me over a chocolate cupcake with purple icing and it was amazing. My friends and I shared it but it was seriously one of the best cupcakes I have had!!Overall, for 6 people who each had a cocktail or 2 the bill came out to around $80 per person.

Walking into this place can be a little overwhelming as there are SO many people in the lobby/bar/waiting area; however once we were escorted to our table things calmed down a bit. The service honestly wasn't too bad considering how busy the place was, as well as the fact that we were a party of about 15 celebrating a birthday - it seemed like everyone in the vicinity was celebrating a birthday that night. Drinks (cocktails were around $17) came out after a little wait but they were strong and tasty, and the waiter was great about taking the food orders. Since we were such a large party I didn't have the chance to taste everyone's food but I can say that the Mac & Cheese was to die for. The food overall was better than I had expected but for such high prices the portions left me wanting more. I don't think I'd return just because Vandal isn't really my cup of tea, but for those looking for an up-beat night on the town, this restaurant would probably meet your needs. It's beautiful, food is good, and music is constant.",0,0,0,Renee S.,"Miami, FL",397,98,203
5.0,10/12/2017,"I really like this place a lot. I would say that this is a go-to Nyc club for birthdays or celebrations of that nature. It just has that vibe. It's definitely not super trendy, but I think it's because it's a newer venue in and is still building character. Are usually see a bunch of people that are visiting New York from out of the country here so that's cool .But I think if this club can last in NYC it will be the official go-to for celebrations, it's a great venue, is pretty spacious, good music and great places to take pictures. Highly recommend for birthdays, especially if you're visiting from out of state. Other clubs can seem overwhelming and intimidating to new people so if you don't want to deal with that, go here !",0,0,0,Janine K.,"New York, NY",1,16,0

3.0,10/7/2017,"My review is pretty much written on a clean slate, as I've never been to Chris Santos' other trendy hotspots, Beauty & Essex and The Stanton Social, so I can't make any comparison.I first came here for my farewell surprise dinner from a coworker. Not going to lie--my eyes widened when I saw the prices for some (ahem, MOST) of the menu items. Expect paying an upwards of $20+ for small-portioned food. They don't have any Happy Hour specials, either. My friend also had a 10-person birthday dinner; she originally reserved a table for 8, tentatively, but the staff insisted that we wait for the rest of the party to arrive--while 7 of us were already seated and had ordered our food. We were finally seated at a larger table when our entire party came. Service is overall good here and the staff is seemingly knowledgeable about their menu items.Some highlights:Roasted Zucchini ($12): A refreshing medley of zucchini, tomatoes, toasted almonds, mint and ricotta cheese, this is a great shareable side dish to go with your entrees (since they don't all come with sides).Chicken + Waffle Mac and Cheese ($17): There aren't really waffles, but rather crunchy cheddar crumbs with bits of chicken. The Tabasco adds a spicy touch that doesn't go too well with very creamy texture, IMO.Chilean Sea Bass ($38): One of the better dishes but Chilean Sea Bass, as we know it, is generally expensive. Beautifully pan seared and perfectly tender and buttery, but serving it with bak choy and peas for the high price tag--really?! Chipotle Shrimp Arepas ($21): So, you are basically $7 for an arepa, which is hardly one at all. It is hors d'oeuvre-sized that is smaller than your palms.Bone-in Filet ($58): Probably my favorite dish of all the ones I've tried, but very pricey. Not the best steak I've ever had, but the foie butter and garlic confit was a fancy touch that made it so tender.Las Palmitas ($17): A cool, refreshing citrusy cocktail infused with Ilegal Mezcal that's perfect for the summer. Spicy notes with Thai basil leaves for some zing and aroma.Will probably not be a choice of mine to come here other than for the drinks, although I can see why people like this place. The service can be great and the interiors are very detailed and decked out--blends in with the whole Lower East Side vibe.",3,1,1,Sharon T.,"Queens, NY",856,1061,1832
2.0,10/7/2017,"Very expansive average food. Yes, I know that you are not exactly paying for the food when you come to a place like such, but more for the experience, the problem is that the experience was not good either.It started with a reservation for a Saturday night (10:30 pm) for a group of 8 people- most of them were visitors and that was their last night in the city so we wanted to end their trip with a ka-boom. We were waiting outside for more than an hour, while the hostess kept telling us the other party is still sitting there and there is nothing they can do about it. This is an hip-cool-sent-of-god-whatever restaurant, yet IT IS NOT REASONABLE TO WAIT FOR A TABLE YOU HAVE RESERVED FOR  MORE THAN AN HOUR, so I could only understand that 3 people from my party wanted to leave. I told so to the hostess and she said that now as a group of 5 people we have to go to the bottom of the list and wait for a new table, so we just waived. The hostess was nice to be honest, very apologetic about the issue and gave me her Vandal email address, assured me that if I ever make reservations again I should email her and she will take personal care of us. Nice of her, but at almost 12am we were starving, all the restaurants were closed and up high on our heels we turned over to McDonald's for a salvation. Forward 2 weeks later, my boyfriend's birthday, last Thursday night. I made a reservation just for the two of us and emailed the hostess (which her name I won't disclose here). She hasn't replying up until last night, saying she was out of the county. Very disappointing, very bad service when it comes to breaking a promise in such an (allegedly) high-end restuclub. Like, lets say she was really out of the county, there is no one from Vandal checking her emails the whole time??? Unprofessional at all. Anyway, our date night there was fun only because I had him next to me. All the other espects were just meh- the $17 cocktails which tasted like something I can mix at home, $24 for 3 generic fish tacos (they weren't bad, they were just nothing special) and some $13 basic Sundae (ok price for that). The waitress was ok, the vibe was meh. The crowd the same crowd you'd expect to see in all Vandal's group other restaurants and clubs (Tao, Stanton Social and Lavo are some). I am always up for giving a business a second change, but not a third one. Next time I would put my money where I feel I am being valued as a costumer. It's funny and sad at the same time that because of the bed experience I forgot to enjoy the space and the art in there.",0,0,0,Amit M.,"New York, NY",16,25,14

They tell you to go wait by the bar but you have about 3 feet of room and it gets so overcrowded and you're right on top of people sitting down at their tables. The food was overall pretty horrible. The only thing that was decent was the chicken parm. We had a few appetizers, roasted squash tostadas which were under cooked and some were hot some were cold so I was confused as to which it was supposed to be. The New York hot pretzel steak tartare was okay but the pretzel was completely stale. The shrimp arepas were flavored horrible and the shrimps tasted like they were frozen. Everything came out cold and their pizza tasted like Ellios frozen pizza. The lounge is overpriced and boring but they usually play decent music. I think people mostly just come here for the name.

4.0,10/1/2017,I have been invited a bunch of times to group dinners here but did not actually make it here until recently for NYC restaurant week. It was Babes' pick which I ended up enjoying without him. I made reservations on OpenTable about a week in advance and there was no wait time upon arrival for my party of 2.Our server was attentive and made some good recommendations but I arrived already knowing what I was going to get. Even better was that the guy next to us had ordered all the same items and was raving about each one. Fish tacos were yummy; I love sea bass. The steak fried rice combo was delicious without being greasy; the steak was cooked perfectly to medium as I requested. Oh and the dessert hit the spot; ice cream macaroon sandwich was sweet but tart and filling. The frozen yogurt was better than expected. The vibe here was turned up even at 7 PM on a Friday. The decor was vibrant. The bathroom were clean. Overall great dining experience. Regular prices might be too steep for a cheap self!,8,4,8,Cassie C.,"Brooklyn, NY",340,184,553

We ordered the brisket bao buns that didn't have much flavor and were ok the dry side (needed some sauce, the shrimp arepas (shrimp had a burnt taste), and the Chilean sea bass taco which were the best thing we ordered- still not as good as the ones at Beauty and Essex.For just those 3 small plate the bill was $68!

4.0,9/23/2017,"I'd like to start by saying I heard mixed reviews about Vandal but more good than bad. So I decided to go there for my birthday. My reservation was for 9 but because I had 2 members of my party of 8 who were late, they gave away our table and we had to wait an hour and a half for another table. Now I get it, some people were late but an hour and a half wait for another table is just unreasonable. I will say though once we got seated, our waiter was amazing. His service was really good and remedied the night. They even comped my table their beef brisket baous since we had to wait, which was much appreciated. Those were really good. Now onto the food. I ordered the lamb sirloin and the fish tacos. I didn't think I'd like the tacos all that much but I was open to trying them. LET ME TELL YALL! GET THOSE FISH TACOS!!! There amazing. Super delicious. The lamb sirloin was also cooked perfectly. The portion was slightly small but it came with 3 small rotis and a cucumber tomato salad of a sort which was enjoyable as well. My friend did get the mac and cheese which she wasn't a fan of. The burger is also a bit small as well. Just something to note. It was also my birthday and the waiter surprised me with a chocolate cupcake. The gesture was appreciated. The overall experience was great besides waiting for the table. The ambience was very nice.

Not only was there no place for my party and I to sit down, we were rudely forced to leave the restaurant area where we had sat with our drinks - despite my having asked for the dessert menu and clearly signaling my intention to order. The bartender had no class and was simply a rude individual, whose gruff and unsociable tone created a hostile setting out of what would have otherwise been a pleasant bar. The club bouncers deliberately didn't tell anyone in the enormous line that nobody would be getting in without buying a $500 table or spending at least $100 per person on drinks.

And even avenue, marquee in NYC & also the beauty & Essex only a few minutes away from this location. I always had a positive experience however my time at Vandal was so unacceptable as patron of your hospitality group. Came here with an RSVP @ 9:30pm on Saturday 9/9/2017 with a group of 8 for dinner . We were not seated until 9:50/10pm-ish. 30 mins after rsvp time to seat a group is just unacceptable & YES my entire party was there ON TIME even prior to RSVP time! The hostesses were snobby from the beginning & even when I asked them if the beeper worked in the outside smoking area she rudely yelled ""yes"" at me! While waiting for our dinner table we spent a little over $100 on drinks at the bar.  We were finally seated, ordered food & drinks. Nice waitress. Okay food for the price. Fast food service & spent over $400 for dinner . Long story short - Our plan was to head downstairs to check out the lounge. however our plan was stopped by a bouncer who specifically told me that for a group of 8 (4 couples) to enter we had to spend a minimum of $1500 on bottle service or else entrance is not allowed. We did not plan on heavily drinking as we have already been drinking throughout the night during wait time. So only 4 of us stayed & attempted to go enter but even for 4 ppl the bouncer says we are required to spend $300 downstairs . The inconsistent prices for the # of people just keeps changing! How freakin ridiculous! Is there no standard set price for anyone or is the price at the bouncer's discretion or judgement of how much money he can make off the patrons? So insane!! We had just spend a good amount of money having dinner upstairs & u still ""REQUIRE"" us to spend more just to go downstairs to hear music?? There were many other people in front of us in different #'s of groups who got in without any conversation of a table minimum! I'm not sure what the deal is!?! I hate to pull the race card Bc we are people of color. However it was very obvious that groups larger then us who were Caucasian were being let in w/out any mention of bottle service requirements. Sounds pretty sketchy to me! Hate to say but what a let down to happen in a city that prides itself on diversity & individualism. I never had this happen to me before anywhere w/ Tao group or even The entire city. I expect a lot better standards and respect from a company that has such a big reputation on overall guest experience. Such a disappointment & total BUZZ kill! Safe to say we left after the debacle.  To add insult to injury we encountered a group of 5 ppl outside who were also subjected to this terrible treatment.

I had the fish tacos, which were really good but since it's tapas style, you aren't really satisfied. You're honestly paying for the scenery and that's all.

3.0,8/30/2017,"Good service, good ambiance but food was just OK. We came to celebrate our birthdays on a weekday. This place was almost empty at first but filled up very quickly as the night went on. Nice bar area with lots of seats. Cocktail prices are steep at $17 dollars each but at the bar it's $9 dollars on select cocktails during weekdays. We ordered the crispy bao buns for appetizer and that was delicious at a steep price of $17 dollars for two (and they were small). Nice marinated brisket  that were flavorful. For dinner I had the salmon with quinoa. That was just very average. I had a bite of my friend's seabass and tuna and both were also just very average. The waitress knew we were celebrating our birthdays and came out with 2 chocolate muffins with candles at the end. That was nice but the muffin was a dry. Overall, definitely pricy and the ambiance and service was great. Food needs to improve for how expensive it is",1,1,2,Lily T.,"New York, NY",723,982,813

From the moment you walk in you are greeted with a graffiti wall and walk through to the hostess stand that is placed in front of an Alice in Wonderland inspired sculpture. This place is an Instagram obsessed girl's dream - the photo ops are endless. The food and drinks are exceptional as well. My party opted for a flatbread pizza, sticky buns, a cute little shrimp pico de gallo treat along with many other options. The waiter was even kind enough to special order each tapa so that there was enough to feed my party of five. The only tapa that we weren't a fan of was the Chicken and Waffle Mac & Cheese...there wasn't any hint of maple or chicken, so I have no idea why they even named the dish in that way. The frose was a sweet treat to have with dinner as well. Although this spot was a cool stop to start off a bachelorette party, I'm not sure I would be back. A $400 meal that consisted of simple tapas seems unreasonable to me. We left still hungry and ready to drink more.",0,0,0,Alyssa K.,"Mullica Hill, NJ",179,336,63
3.0,8/28/2017,"Brunch Review: I came here on a Saturday for a brunch date with my cousins, we had 1:30 reservations which probably weren't needed as the place was fairly empty.. I was actually a little shocked, I mean the place was nice, décor and ambiance are amazing. One thing I want to address because it's something I came on here looking for prior to my visit is parking.  There is street parking not too difficult to find within a 3 block radius, however... it is one hour parking and the machines don't necessarily work.. Despite my running out a few times, I ended up with a ticket.  Anyway on to the brunch.. so my vegetarian near vegan cousin did the honors in picking Vandal, as I stated before definitely a visually appealing place, our waitress was the sweetest too, she was very helpful with menu selections etc. We got a few things based on her recommendation including the Wild mushroom pizza which was amazing! And my Rio de Frose, omg that drink is both visually appealing and delicious.. My cousin got a manly Off the Wall which was delicious as well.  My actual brunch Entrée was forgettable, it was the egg white Florentine omelette, I can't lie I did have plate envy of my sister's lobster and asparagus omelette and my cousins steak stir fry (a little salty)... we order like 3 orders of their salt and vinegar fries because they were so good and also we were still hungry... Ok so here is the thing, when I think of brunch, you are combining breakfast and lunch, I think of being satisfied.. despite ordering the pizza for the table our individual entrees and fries.. all of us were still hungry! My one cousin actually order three entrees, two of them being the different pancakes and an omelette and he was still hungry as well.. they only give two fairly small pancakes with both their canoli (not great) and coffee (better) pancakes.  That was pretty disappointing that we all experienced the same hunger when we done, especially because we spent about $100 each.  We actually tried to order dessert but was told we would have to wait for the dinner dining to start :(  Or waitress did open the graffiti staircase for us and we got some dope family pics so that was awesome.  Would I come back, yes... for drinks and a lite bite, but definitely not for brunch.",4,1,1,Jess J.,"Cherry Hill, NJ",156,226,545

After 35 mins we sat down and were immediately served delicious complimentary appetizers from the chef great because of the long wait. The drinks were good, our amazing waitress recommended me a drink which was spicy and delicious. Everrrrrrything here has a kick of spice. It was like an explosion in my mouth. Lol. I highly recommend the Bao Buns, fish tacos and the miso glazed eggplant, omg delicious. We had skirts steak over rice with a fry egg on top, the steak was cooked to perfection but the rice was on the oily side for my taste. The music was great old school and new school hip hop.

Slowly he takes the drinks orders and a few apps. He comes to me eventually and we discuss a drink with lime ginger jalapeños mint etc... and he scribbled something down they looks like elvish. Fast forward 10 mins and he's still there!!! My friends said he was on something - and I then realized he was. Another 5 mins pass and he's still hanging around trying to get the order. My wife wanted vodka on the rocks and he kept insisting it was neat. 10 mins later after eventually asking the manager to change our server, whom he claimed was the best, whatever, our drinks arrive.So here is a run down of the order:2 lagavulin (our server had never heard of it)1 grey goose on the rocks1 virgin margarita1 special organic fresh drink for meThis is what came:1 Macallan 251 grey goose neat 1 grey goose on the rocks1 virgin margarita ""Where's my drink?"" So I asked our second server that I asked for a bunch of things and she said the bar has NO jalapeño, ginger, anything spicy etc. shocking!The food order was pretty much all the veg stuff on the menu and the bao buns for me because I eat farm animals and sometimes game. Gator once. Oh and kangaroo once too. Never tried frogs.We got an extra pizza which was not ordered. Generally the food was ok, but pricey for veg though. The buns I got were good but only 2 for $15. You're better off going to a taco truck but you won't see the pretentious crowd there. Seems like all the women went to a hair dresser for a red carpet event before coming. The dessert was pretty good but then again how can you mess up fried and sugar right?Ok now for our last order of two lemon drop shots from our original guy... when he brought it out he gave it to the wrong table!!! WHAT??? It's the table you just got the order from a minute ago buddy!! Unbelievable...So high point was some good food, the extra candles I asked for (gracias amigos), and some convo about some server in an altered state - effects of the solar eclipse - which it totally cool but take the week off man.I would go back for drinks and just hang.

I came here on a Saturday evening-- it started off a little rocky because despite having a reservation, I was given a beeper and told when it rang my table was ready. Unfortunately, after about 30 minutes of no activity, the misses because flustered, and wanted to leave. I made my way back to the hostesses (they had three, which is helpful) I was told the table just opened up.We made our way through the crowd, were seated toward the back. Music was bumping, people looked excited-- it just seemed like everyone was having a great time. We ordered drinks and food at the same time since we only had about an hour before we had to leave. We had the Roasted Tostadas (too spicy for me), Margarita Pizza (tasted great) and Pan Roasted Salmon with Quinoa (Salmon was ok; I thought the Quinoa was great). I thoroughly enjoyed this place--everything was almost perfect except the wait time in the beginning and the large crowds of people you have to side step. Also, the food takes quite awhile to come out, so you may want to eat a little something prior to arrival. The Sangria was probably the strongest I've ever had in my life. Both the hostess and server made a point to say Happy Birthday, which shows they actually read the Open Table message, and prices were fair.All and all, it's a place to definitely visit at least once in life. I would use the phrases hip or trendy when describing Vandal-- but without the pretentious vibe.

No. They said we can enter if we get bottle service. Again, no. Their attitude towards was incredibly obnoxious and condescending. As another bouncer was trying to clear the area by the lounge, he kept pushing us ladies into the bar area. We had to move in a line and slowly as the bar was packed.

At no point did they mention a charge to get in (which wouldn't have been a problem) or it being ""guest list only"" so of course we invited all of our friends to celebrate a birthday with us. I monitored the order of service and the number of people coming and going so using ""capacity"" as an excuse was just lazy. The lounge was no where near full so to turn away money is just stupid and bad business. I tried to reason with them in a respectful and professional manner but I was given short respeonses (if any at all) and a little attitude. I don't want to say it was a racial thing but a group of people, not Black or African American, were let in problem-free. And they did not have a VIP section either, in fact the sections were 75% empty!Despite that, we did enjoy the party but it sucks that 5 of our friends who were visiting couldn't make it inside.

When the guy in our group then decided to leave so that we could go in, the bouncer than said there was no room and he couldn't let us on. Okay, chew on that. He himself was wearing ripped jeans that were in shreds and a graphic tshirt. I am not sure who he was trying to bully or if he didn't realize that the neighboring area is filled with orher clubs and bars and that there was 0 line for this place. I am sure this is not the only place in NY that does this, but it will absolutely be the last time I ever come to Vandal and I suggest you never come here either.",8,2,0,Julianne Z.,"Minneapolis, MN",287,302,401
3.0,8/5/2017,Checked it out with a few friends during restaurant week. The ambience is absolutely beautiful. Easily has the best decor in all of NYC. The music was good too although it was pretty loud. The food was okay. Not what I expected from this restaurant and for the amount of time we waited to get the food. No one came to our table and gave us an approximation of how long the food would take which I thought would have been courteous. It took about 40 minutes to get our appetizers and another 40 minutes to get our entrees. I ordered the chicken parm which was good. I just wish it came with pasta. A bit pricey too.,0,0,0,Kelsey C.,"Jamaica, NY",0,5,2

Cocktails were awesome (frosè all day), and the whole place is covered in Shepard Fairey art. The food, however, was okay. $18 Caesar salads were a bit ridiculous.  The promising chicken & waffle mac and cheese ended up being as promising as my first marriage (I've never been married but that was funny).

5.0,8/3/2017,"Ever in the mood for a great, relaxing meal, but still want to get dressed up and feel like you're out for a night on the town? Vandal is one of those trendy spots where the menu (and crowd) is fresh, sexy and hip - some favorites include the raw bar's fresh shucked oysters, poke bowl and staple NYC hot pretzel steak tartare. Whether you're craving the tomahawk ribeye, ""big sexy burger"" or something lighter like the flash seared tuna, Vandal certainly has something for anyone's palette. If you still have room for dessert the s'mores is absolutely unforgettable. Management was fabulous and checking on our party throughout the meal, as busy as operations can be were extremely attentive with great hospitality. Vandal is not only good for dinner but they host happy hour and different events throughout the week! One of TAO Group's newer concepts, Vandal's decor is very unique, with art sculptures, paintings and graffiti throughout the bar area, multiple dining rooms and evening lounge. What I love is that every room has a completely different vibe, so you can go to this venue over and over and feel like you are in a completely new and exciting environment each time. Overall excellent and cannot wait to go back.

Upon arrival I can hear the music before entering. We walked through a beautiful flower shop to the host and the decor was amazing! We arrived about 20/25mins before our reservations so we got our buzzer and headed to the bar until we were called to our table. The music was really loud and it kind of felt like we were in a club note to others this is not a place to set up a business dinner. All in all we loved it! The food was delicious and the dessert was amazing!

3.0,7/30/2017,"Vandal is one of those places where you pass by and think ""How come I never come here?"" It is definitely a scene for those who do not mind spending $20 on a cocktail. The interior is exquisitely decorated with graffiti, plants and fairy lights. You immediately feel like you walked into an expensive lounge. In addition to their many indoor dining areas, Vandal also has outdoor seating and a lounge downstairs (you need to pay to get in). I would not recommend sitting outside because the neighborhood isn't exactly cute. We made reservations here on a Friday and the place was really busy. We ordered off the restaurant week menu and the food was pretty good. For starters we ordered the tacos and poke. As an entree we got the salon & quinoa and the flank steak. For dessert we got the churros and macaron ice cream sandwich. The starters were pretty decent. However I wish the poke bowl came with chips or crisps. I felt like the dish was missing something when I ate just the raw fish. The entree felt similar to the starter. Good, but missing something. My salmon and quinoa could have used some more greens. The dessert however was on point. The churros came with a spiced chocolate dip that was amazing. The churros were so soft and they are served warmed. The macaron ice cream sandwich was also delightful. They make it with frozen yogurt instead of ice cream. It was so good! Definitely try these two desserts for restaurant week!

1.0,7/29/2017,"I really tried to be the optimist about this place out of all my friends who were ready to walk out mid-meal....but dang, it was hard. Basically, if you're fine with freezing your bum off while music blasts so loud you can't hear the people next to you, all so you can be seen eating (honestly) overpriced mediocre food at a trendy place, this place is your jam. Otherwise stay clear.To start, our reservation was at 1045pm. We weren't sat until almost midnight. The staff never apologized and their only solution was to tell us to go buy a drink at the bar. While that wasn't the waitresses fault, my friend did inform her when we sat down that we were starving because we had been waiting so long to be sat with a reservation. It took her 20 minutes to come back to take our food order. I will be fair and give her credit and say that I have a lot of food allergies and she was very knowledgeable, kind and accommodating with that.We asked multiple times of theAC or music could be turned down, since we were all shivering (in July), but were given an excuse about the actual being down stairs. We weren't sure what that meant, but there was a visible thermostat in our room. To combat the chill, I ordered a hot chocolate from the coffee bar, which was earnestly the worst I'd ever drank in my entire life. It wasn't until I was halfway through my hot chocolate that I was (unprompted) brought sugar, indicating there was none in the drink to start with and that should have come out with the drink.At around 1230, 1 HR and 45 minutes after our scheduled reservation time, my friend finally lost it and went to go complain since we still hadn't received our appetizers. Magically they and the manager suddenly appeared. After that we had to wait ANOTHER 30 minutes to see our entrees. Do not ever get anything with French fries in this establishment. It was a mountain of salt, and no one at my table could eat more than 2. My lips and gum puckered from the salt content as if I'd been drinking salt water.We had to wait another 30 minutes for our desserts. Because I had so many allergies, she said she would check what I could have, which I appreciated, but at no point was I told what I could have, so when it finally did come out, it was a complete mystery/surprise to me. It was some kind of berry sorbet and blue macaroon, which, while the macaroon was good, I can only describe the sorbet as the ice cream equivilant of the Starbucks unicorn frappe so it was more or less inedible. They did attempt to smooth things over by offering to buy us a round of shots in between dinner and dessert , but we were so far done down the rabbit hole of being freezing, hungry, etc. That we declined because we just wanted out of there. We came in at 1040 for a 1045 reservation, and ultimately left at almost 2am, with a. 20% discount for our troubles.while I appreciate the gesture, there will never be a return visit in the future and honestly , it's not that I'm mad at our particular waitress or employee. Since every possible aspect of the evening was an abject failure, the only conclusion I can draw is a failure in management.

4.0,7/29/2017,Vandal was pretty cool on a Friday night. Upstairs is the restaurant (they do have a bar) and downstairs is the club part. (Guys wear pants) if u wanna get in the club part.  Cocktails where $17 dollars but worth it try (off the wall) isuoer good. Crowd as mixed dj was good. But if your looking dance then the downstairs part is good for you.  Cool decor to take lots of pics with friends. There wasn't a line on a Friday but lots of people just standing outside we walked right in. DO NOT DRIVE.  Parking is not good at all and the traffic is crazy.

1.0,7/26/2017,"Horrible restaurant week experience because of the service. I'll only give you a star because of the food. I had the sea bass tacos, skirt steak, and churros - everything was great. Let me tell you about the service you get tho - My boyfriend and I ordered the same entree (skirt steak), and mine came in a considerably larger portion in a better presentation. We talked to our waiter, and asked him about the difference. He said that he noticed it, and he'll bring back the plate to the kitchen. I don't know what happened, but apparently, he could not solve this on his own, so he sent the manager over. The following conversation ensued. Guys, I'm not lying, I was really polite in asking him, but he had the most entitled personality ever. He was saying it with so much attitude...Me: Why does his (my boyfriend) plate contain little pieces of steak compared to mine? Manager: Oh because yours is actually a regular portion.Me: Okay...Manager: They made a mistake in the kitchen. You got lucky! Do you want me to bring back your plate and get you the restaurant week portion? Like seriously? Even our waiter was surprised. His plate looked like all the small edges of other skirt steaks were given to him. We were understanding customers who were not even complaining about the lack of service with our waiter. He even came up to us, and said ""It's been an hour since I last checked, and you guys are still okay? Perfect!"" We had to wait an hour to get seated (with reservations), and we still were just excited to eat. So you, whoever you are, you deserve this one freaking star.

2.0,7/24/2017,"I came here two nights ago on a Saturday for the lounge to celebrate my birthday. The minute I stepped through the door, it was gorgeous but as I walked in the hostess was rude telling me I can't stand blocking the door when clearly there was no where else to stand. Then I asked her how do I get to the lounge. With unclear questions I just followed the path until I saw ""ropes"" like she said I would. We  reached the ropes and and two suited men stood there, we asked how to get to the lounge and they stared at us with blank faces. So I asked again, is this where the lounge is, and the bouncers response was ID. Okay so I showed him ID AND no directions of where it is, walked past the secret door. Finally found the door and the vibe was cool. Drinks were on the more expensive side, but tasty. I had gotten there slightly before 10, but a bunch of my friends arrived a little after 10 and the bouncers wouldn't let them down to the lounge if they didn't have table reservation or didn't have dinner here. I'm sitting at the lounge which was more on the empty side. Terrible customer service. I understand if it was completely packed and they have to honor those who paid for their time there but it's completely unprofessional to deny entrance when it was empty.

1.0,7/24/2017,"Terrible experience here due to false advertising on prices. Restaurant charges a different price than what is shown on their menu and refuses to honor it until we spoke with manager.I came here for their happy hour, which was $7 for frosés and other cocktail drinks as advertised on their website AND on the menu they gave us at the bar. I ordered two drinks and when they gave me the bill, they had charged me $9 per drink. I spoke with the bartender who simply said ""sorry, we have to charge at $9 a drink"" and gave no reason as to why the menu I ordered off of listed them for $7.The manager came over to speak with us and told us that their menu's were wrong. Um, if they are wrong, why are you letting everyone order off of it? He explained that per NYC law, happy hour prices cannot be less than half of the regular price so they must charge $9. He admitted that it was their mistake and gave me a new happy hour menu that showed the $9 prices. He nicely comped our drinks due to this price error. I checked back on their website a few days later and they are still advertising $7 cocktail drinks and unfortunately have not updated it. I give this place one-star due to their blatant disregard for their deceitful prices and clearly no urgency in taking care of the problem.As a side note, their frosés are pretty good and come with a pretty flower on top.

1.0,7/23/2017,"Overpriced and overly pretentious.   We came for a birthday party dinner and was forced to order from their family style portioned prefix menu.  I'm not against family style, but when it's easier for the restaurant to plate and serve, it better be a reasonable portion size for everyone.  The restaurant seems to skimp on food even for an $85 pp + tax + tip + service fee requirement.  I was born and raised here in NYC and it's these types of establishments that give NYC a bad reputation for being overpriced.  As for the lounge downstairs.  The bouncers are certified pricks and the male host (you know who you are) claims the place is going to be packed later and wouldn't let our group in after spending $2k on dinner.  It was only 10pm and half of us weren't heavy drinkers or staying all night.  I know the club game, and I've seen some establishments handle it well and others like this one do it poorly.  People wait on line to go in and most likely buy drinks.  If you think bottle service requirements is going to make more money, then that's short-sighted.  Forcing a bottle does not make customers want to come back.  If this place wants to be a one hit wonder, it's well on its way.  I'll be happy to see it go down in the dumps in a few years when word spreads.  Message to management: Next time, check the weather to see if it's going to be pouring rain later. It's unlikely the lounge is going to be crowded.  Your job is to service your customers, and when you treat them like sh*t you deserve the same treatment as well.  I only wish someone else treats you as poorly in life as you have treated us.  You definitely have it coming.  If this review deters even one potential customer, that would be enough for me.  Thanks for reading!",2,0,0,J D.,"New York, NY",1,39,11

1.0,7/5/2017,"Supposedly a celebration of global street food and street art, this place takes alternative, accessible art and food and commodifies it, packaging it at a ridiculously high price for those who want to be trendy. The good: I can say that the server was attentive and helpful and I appreciate that they refilled my water glass soon after it was low. I also like that they have some vegetarian options on the menu. The bad: The decor is supposed to evoke street art, but is inherently inauthentic and overdone. The white ""graffiti"" on the black wall saying ""Men"" to designate the men's bathroom is just one example of trying a little too hard. The food, while not bad, was not exceptional. And my 3 mini cauliflower tacos (about 2-3 bites each) came to a whopping $16! (And that's before you factor in tax and tip.) The cocktails, even if they are good, are not worth $17 each. This is the kind of place Long Islanders come to with their Murray Hill bro pals to be trendy-cool and then go to wait in line for an hour to get into the new ""hottest"" club nearby in the LES.

The staff is so pleasant and polite. Since we arrived a bit before our reservations we sat at the bar waiting for our table to be ready. The drinks are a bit pricey and so is the food but it's worth the money. The cauliflower and sea bass tacos are to die for. The seared tuna with squash purée and buck choy was delicious. My husband had steak and the salt fries and he devoured the plate. We had s'mores for dessert, and it's the best dessert I've ever had in my life it was that good.

The walls are filled with cool designs and there're complimentary matches at the door for you to take on your way out. Almost every corner of the restaurant allows for instagram worthy pictures for sure. Definitely choose to sit inside as opposed to the outdoor seating! The cocktails were good but a bit pricey in my opinion ($17), although that's expected for a place like this. The menu is mostly fusion food. We ordered the margherita pizza, crispy bao buns, the salmon, and the chicken parm - all to share. The crispy bao buns were SOO GOOOOD. Fried to perfection and a creative twist to the traditional baos. It was kind of disappointing that they didn't offer anything for birthdays, since it was two of my friends' birthdays. The waiter said we can buy a dessert and they'll give us a candle -_____-The bathrooms are super nice and clean and there's even someone handing you paper towels inside. Would I come back?

I understand that there was a lot of people and they are trying to be faster, but they definitely should at least try to ask people to move aside more politely first.

2.0,6/29/2017,"Honestly, I feel like this place is overrated. The food was terrible. We had the margherita pizza, crispy bao buns, Mac and cheese, burger & fries and some drinks. The margherita pizza wasn't tasty at all. Extremely thin and the dough tasted like it was taken out before being throughly cooked. Crispy bao buns were TINY. I'm talking $16 for two tiny little buns with ONE slice of beef brisket inside lol they weren't bad... but extremely small. Mac and cheese - I couldn't eat at all. It tasted more like pasta with a sauce than Mac and cheese. The burger & fries were ok... nothing special The drinks are over priced for sure. Small drinks at $16 a pop. None of which tasted good either. The two stars is for the decor, super cute. Definitely a good place to take pictures for the gram ;) also the DJ was playing good music and we also liked the fact that they brought the birthday girl a cupcake with a candle.

4.0,6/26/2017,"I loved my dining experience here and would come back in a heart beat. Must-order recommendations:1. Eggplant apetizer. Cut into cubes, lightly crispy on all sides. It's unique and tasty, and I will forever be dreaming about it.2. The 14-oz bone-in filet with fois gras was also super tasty. The fois gras was light like a melting ice cube but added a nice, subtle flavor to the steak.I also ordered the crispy pork baos, wild mushroom pizza, and salt and vinegar fries, which was plenty of food for three people. The pizza and the fries were great. I didn't prefer the pork buns as they are quite a departure from traditional cha siu baos. The meat was packed with a strong flavor, and so the crispy bun didn't balance it out as a steamed rice flour bun would.As for cocktails, I had the sakura park and trigger finger.

No longer is this place the ""new"" hot spot still it is very popular a little too much if u ask me simply because it makes for very long wait times even with a reservation. Recently stopped by we had a RSVP for 945 due to crazy traffic we were 20 minutes late I did call to inform them which didn't make jack of a difference since once we arrived by the time we sat down it was an hour later ughhh so not cool. Drinks at the bar while we waited tried the Up all night very good this is stoli with Red Bull orange some raspberry with lemon tasty drink also had the Double Dutch great drink could be a little less sweet add some of that Red Bull & it's even better. Bar area is very crowded not comfortable to have everyone on top of each other people have no concept of the word ""sorry"" or even a simple ""excuse me"" so annoying. They sat us in the front area which wouldn't have been so bad expect it was too hot took them some time to crank up the AC.Food we tried the Crispy Bao buns great tasting brisket is very good. The Crab Cake corn dogs yumm this was delicious good sauce. Next the Chicken & waffle Mac & cheese very good Mac it had a bit of spicy to it. & finally the Chipotle shrimp arepas great tasting grilled shrimp taste good tomatillo & roasted corn combo w the arepa. This is one of those places that u come more for the ambiance than the food & drinks since it is & can get pretty pricey.I do like the place don't like the long wait times now & quick service to drop all the food on you even though we asked that they didn't do that not a fan of the food being rushed out & then super slow at collecting the check.Fun vibe, cool art & very good music playing so far I haven't had anything I didn't like so I will continue to visit from time to time.",7,5,7,Ginette P.,"New York, NY",546,1069,6718
1.0,6/25/2017,"Arrived to my dismay to see my friends waiting at the bar for their table.  (Three of the four had arrived; I was unavoidably late due to parade traffic.). That they had not been seated was totally unacceptable given that the restaurant was not full (on OpenTable, reservations were available for 4 every 15 minutes, all night), but this crew was easy going and did not complain. When I arrived my friends closed out their bar tab and went back to the host stand to get their table.  They were given a vibrating beeper (the kind you might get at a suburban mall restaurant) and told the table was not ready.  I rolled my eyes, which, together with my friend's inquiry (along the lines of ""the table isn't ready?"") prompted the response from the (awful) hostess: ""the reservation was for 8pm and its 8:30 so we moved on,"" (a verbatim quote) even though the restaurant of course knew they were in the bar (where I was told they were when I arrived).  I put up with the wait for 7 minutes more before hopping on OpenTable, booking immediately at Gato a couple of blocks away, and dropping the beeper on the counter as we exited. The restaurant still looks fine, but as someone who was there once before (and thought it was good, not great) and as a native New Yorker who has lived the Manhattan restaurant scene his entire life, it is obvious to me that ""hot"" restaurants with attitude and little else to back it up end up as flashes in the pan because they do not engender brand or client loyalty.  Too many options in NYC to put up with nonsense, so we took our $500 elsewhere.

1.0,6/5/2017,"I was in town from Toronto, ON for a good friend's bachelorette weekend and we picked Vandal for our Saturday night out. I have always had a wonderful time at many NYC hot spots both on my own and with native New Yorkers. As an individual in the finance industry, I often take clients out in NYC and other large cosmopolitan cities - this is not my first rodeo. This review is mostly directed at the lounge and not the restaurant.The dinner portion of our evening was good; the food was palatable but not exceptional by any means. The drinks were interesting but perhaps a little over-priced for what they were. Our waiter was very patient and happy to accommodate when some of the food was not to our liking - he was probably the bright spot of an otherwise average dinner. The truly appalling part happened after dinner. As we were settling up our dinner cheque, the wait staff kindly offered to see how long the line up was to head down to the lounge. We were prepared to stay there for the night and drop some significant $ to make sure our friend had a fun bachelorette night. He indicated that there was no line and he just saw a few people stroll in with no problem. When we approached the men at the door, first of all there was barely any acknowledgement that we were trying to speak with them. They gave my friend, the bride-to-be, a lame excuse that it was mandatory that you have bottle service in order to be let in. When we called to make our reservation we specifically asked that question as well as to our waiter when we finished dinner. There was no mention of mandatory bottle service. Fine - I will give you the benefit of the doubt that maybe it was a busy night and the requirements had changed in the last 10 minutes since we checked. Since we were considering bottle service anyways, we asked ""Joe"" at the door what the cost would be. He responded in a highly condescending manner and implied we couldn't afford the $1500 cost. I assure you, we were a highly educated group of professional women that were more than capable of shelling it out if we wanted to. The attitude of the bouncers left a terrible impression on our whole group. Just as we were deciding on secondary plans, we watched a group of girls walk in without table service (we asked them) and the bouncer gave them no problems. The only difference I could see between their group and ours is that we were a more racially diverse group i.e. not all Caucasian. We were dressed for a nice night out and very respectful in our conversation with the bouncers. That respect was clearly not reciprocated. While I don't think our experience at Vandal is a reflection of NYC as a whole, it is a reminder that racism is still alive and well at some establishments. This kind of behaviour should never be tolerated. I would never recommend anyone go to Vandal for this reason. There are too many other amazing hot spots in NYC for Vandal to matter.

It had this energy that stuff was going on and you wanted to be part of it - even if that meant just being just as loud as everyone around you.We ordered a ton of dishes and overall - not bad food wise. The atmosphere makes me think the food was better than it was but really it was better than what I had anticipated for a 'buzz' restaurant. We tried the nori rolls, fluke ceviche, sticky rice, the korean cakes (my fave), the bao buns, fish tacos, cauliflower katsu and brussel sprouts. For all the food we ordered it was reasonably priced and tasted surprisingly good.One of my motivations for going was the amazing art work thats housed in this space.

4.0,5/6/2017,"I'd give it 5 stars if the portions were slightly larger... not that I'm looking for mountains of food... but five silver dollar pancakes is more of breakfast tapas than a full breakfast. But the food was tasty and the atmosphere wonderfully artsy and lively once brunch gets going after the noon hour. The front room is airy and green giving you an outdoor feel. Totally worth going back. The hostess is typical NYC 20 something obnoxious with her goth eye liner and matching attitude making faces to the person she's speaking with on the phone while at the same time accusingly asking if we had a reservation for their literally EMPTY albeit one table in the entire room at the time restaurant - LOL; why yes, we do indeed have a reservation; good thing - since you look so booked, not... but everyone else was lovely.

4.0,5/5/2017,"Since I like my cocktails to taste good, I was a little anxious about the drink menu at first glance since there wasn't anything sweet there.  I ordered the Las Palmitas figuring anything that has grapefruit bitters and beer in it has to be good-- and that was how I found my favorite cocktail in the city to date.

Part of the famous Chef Chris santos chain of restaurants, this place is unique and different. We were seated on the patio area where the large hedges block the outside where you still feel like you are indoors without the fuss of the outside. The menu screams a street food fare style food and mostly Asian street fare with a tinge of Mexican. We ordered a plethora of items. The table favorite was the crunchy French toast which is battered and deep fried with a red bean filling. The other favorite was the white pizza. Stay away from the Benedict which was just not good. The hummus and eggs were unique and different and paired well together.

The food is good and drinks here are great, but then the real reason you'd come here is the excellent vibe and the ambiance of the place.The space is extremely social-media friendly, right from the giant acrobatic bunny statue at the entrance to the trendy bar, from the vintage car near the nightclub entrance to the graffiti covered walls of the inner dining rooms. The crowd here is dressed to the nines and the entire setup gives a vibe of the kind of place that people go to see and be seen. The drinks we got were well made and strong, no complaints there whatsoever. As for the food, the concept is great (street-style food from around the world? Sign me up!) but the execution falls short. We got the heaven spot mini burger, the crispy bao buns, the street kebabs and the nori spiced tuna rolls. Everything was decent but we felt that the dishes were lacking the sort of punch that the restaurant delivers in every other aspect.Great restaurant overall, and it would be an easy choice for an awesome night out on the town.

Even though we were running a little bit late, they were very accommodating and just had us wait in the bar area for the last few members of our party. When everyone arrived, we were seated in the covered outdoor garden area, which had a cool vine-y feel, cute bright lights on wires on the ceiling, and awesome graffiti art!Vandal is a place for sharing tapas / street food, which 6 of us partook in. Most of the dishes came as three, so we had multiple orders of some dishes. We had the potato gnocchi, sticky rice dumplings (2), blackened shrimp arepas (2), crispy bao buns (2), Chilean sea bass tacos (2), and wild mushroom pizza. Everything was very delicious, which we were impressed with! The wild mushroom pizza, crispy bao buns, and sea bass tacos were the highlights.

3.0,4/23/2017,"Really only only deserves 2 1/2 stars but I couldn't give just two. They bill themselves as a clubstaurant and didn't really deliver. Have heard a lot of hype about Vandel the last few months. Stopped in around 10pm on Thursday to get a few drinks and maybe a few apps if we could get a table with friends. We were very disappointed that it wasn't busy, we were looking for a lively crowd that was the reason for coming here. It was actually empty which was even more surprising. The music selection was good but the DJ wasn't. Bad mixes. They would have been better off just putting on XM or Pandora. The saving grace was the food and decor. Had eaten much earlier just wanted to pick on something while we drank. The arancini were very good as were the dumplings.i would order them again if I decide to come back. Pretzel steak tartare was good but would try something different next time. We split a couple of skirt steak dinners and a couple of mini burgers. Skirt steak over fried rice was really tasty and spicy. Definitely recommend. Burgers were good as well. The place was really cool looks like it should be busy.

2.0,4/11/2017,"Highly upset with this place! I'm a huge foodie and when I knew I was going to NY this was a must on my list, I had read great reviews and the pictures of this place looked awesome. When I first got there they made me wait for a table after I had made reservations. I was there with 8 ppl as a reunion because I was visiting from Miami. We spent at least $50 each at the bar while waiting for our table. When we were finally seated we spent another $1000 on food/drinks between the 8'of us which we didn't mind at all because we really had a nice dining experience. We loved the art on the walls, the music playing and our server was very attentive. Our experience turned sour very quickly when a friend suggested that we could downstairs to a bar they had. The girl at the front asked if our name was on the list and we told her no, that we already had a table that our friend was sitting at. She then said that it was at full capacity downstairs and we couldn't go down. I would've been ok with that if that were true but my friend who was down there told me it was not full that it was actually pretty empty. The girl proceeded to let like 10 people in while we stood there. I then asked again if they had reached capacity how was she able to let 10 ppl in, and she stated that if we bought bottles for a table she would let us in as well. So she lied to us, it wasn't that it was at capacity it was that they wanted to sell more bottles. Obviously money wasn't an issue for us because we had just dropped over a $1000 on dinner so the fact that she did not want to let us in until we bought bottles was ridiculous to me. I have never been treated like that in my life and will not be returning to this place. I asked a guy to bring me the manager he guy disappeared and the manager never came. I cannot believe that such a nice place conducts business like this. It's a shame because the vibe and the food was really good. I don't recommend you spend your money here.

Finally, today  is the ""exact "" month to make reservations only to be put on hold for 20 minutes !!!!

4.0,3/26/2017,"Super trendy and hip restaurant. Went for dinner with some friends to sample their RW menu and brunch with their Gilt city menu. When you arrive there's a flower shop first - as you must go through that before reaching the hostess. There's a huge bunny figure in the front and if you wanna take a photo with the backdrop then you gotta ask the security guard to go behind the gates for a quick pic. There's a video app in the other corner too if you wanna do some boomerang type thing ( wasn't there during brunch). We were seated in the bright room with the greenery as background for brunch and deep inside for dinner. The gilt brunch menu included allowed us to pick one from each of the four categories. Since I had two vouchers we picked a total of 2 from each and had two bottles of prosecco. We opted for the cranberry ginger croissants and coffee pancakes for the starters. The coffee pancakes weren't overbearing with coffee flavor and were adorned with strawberries and chocolates. When the mushroom pizza was laid on our table the smell of truffles was so good. The pizza was thin and crispy just the way I like it. The tuna tataki came with about five slices of tuna and thinly roasted beets, carrots and yellow peppers. The veggies were nice but the tuna was ok. The chilaquiles, gravlax, double smoked bacon and grilled Brussels sprouts came out next. We may have left the chilaquiles out for a bit as the nacho chips became a bit soggy. I enjoyed the gravlax which had a crispy potato latkes under a bed of cream cheese and salmon. The double bacon was super crispy and weren't so fatty but the Brussels sprouts were overly burnt. For dessert we ordered churros and Irish coffee milkshake shots. The churros were so good even though the chocolate dip was a little on the spicy side. The Irish coffee milkshakes were delicious and a great way to end the meal. Our server for brunch was really great and kept coming over to top off our waters or bubbly. She would also check up on us and to see how everything was.

The atmosphere is really cool, the whole street art vibe is awesome, in combination with street food from all over the world... COOL concept! That said, I don't think they translated the idea very well.  Making "" street food"" fancy and expensive tiny bites .. kind of depletes the whole idea of ""street food"" to begin with. Makes the whole experience a lot less cool, and more ""wannabe"" cool. The crowd was so "" try-hard"" it wasn't a cool crowd, it was a too trendy crowd. Trendy is the last stage before tacky. The whole restaurant was just trying so hard to be cool, that it was doing the exact opposite. Also it was freezing everywhere inside.. and our waitress was moody and irritated. (Not cute) Honestly the plating and food taste reminded me of the suburban chain restaurant PF Changs. Only PF Changs has better food. For 20 dollars an appetizer, I want the food to be on point, it was okay. Nothing special.. at all. Our empty plates were not cleaned up properly, and the whole experience was very amateur feeling.

But instead she first said we could not sit there because we had already ordered at the bar dismissing us abruptly. VERY RUDE.

It fits in the trendy category and the ""must be seen"" in type of establishment. Don't get me wrong, it was a great place for a bunch of guys looking to catch up and catch a couple drinks with a couple of small bites. We got stuck with an early reservation, last minute but albeit they were able to accommodate. Once you enter you see the famous upside down bunny and the hostess happily greeting everyone. It was pretty barren when we entered but by the time we left, it was filled to the brim. We basically ordered one of everything and in some cases, two. We had two vegetarians in the party littered amongst carnivores and vandal had enough to satisfy both. The veggies enjoyed the za'atar bread and especially the crispy eggplant. We also ordered 2 of the margherita and wild mushroom pizzas. I was certainly a fan of the wild mushroom. It didn't have that over bearing mushroom flavor, it was just perfect. I would recommend passing over the tomahawk ribeye. A nice way of putting it is that it was quite lackluster. The two pound lobster scampi was basically two pounds of rice sprinkled with some lobster pieces. Other than that, nothing here really stood out.

3.0,3/9/2017,"Fantastic scene and very cool vibe! They've taken a page from a book of another similarly trendy LES spot, Beauty & Essex, in that they have the decor and atmosphere to attract the who's who clientele and then proceed to make it extremely hard to capture a reservation. Despite securing a reservation more than 3 weeks in advance and arriving precisely on time we were still directed to get drinks at the bar and ended up waiting another 45 minutes before getting seated. The set-up of the restaurant is fairly sprawling with multiple rooms and interesting artwork/graffiti displayed throughout. So Vandal would warrant top marks from an atmosphere perspective but the food is a different story...We all ordered cocktails at the bar - fairly delicious. My sergeant bell pepper was spicy but still excellent; whereas the ladies' cocktails seemed to taste slightly too sweet and didn't pack a punch the way others would be. Following the painfully long wait to get seated, we then had to wait longer than would traditionally be expected to (i) place a food order and (ii) actually get any food. Unlike it's neighborhood brethren, B&E, the food at Vandal was very underwhelming. Every dish we ordered sounded extremely delicious but then as they arrived they all seemed to be quite mediocre. Pork belly buns - mehhOctopus - no flavorbrussel sprouts - very averagesticky rice dumplings - not greatthe only redeeming order was the skirt steak over fried rice - that one was actually very delicious with the egg and veggies.

But once inside, it felt like we stepped into Alice's Wonderland with the upside down rabbit and loud black and white decor. To the left was the bar and booth seating. We followed the hostess through the bar and through another themed room. I was taken by surprise at how large and spacious the restaurant was. The decor is pretty sweet! There's even a downstairs area but it was closed off at the time we went. I was so happy we got a huge booth corner table for my group of 3! We settled in and ordered from the the Restaurant Week Menu, which had a good global mix of the items they served.  Out of everything we ordered, I recommend the Spicy Korean Rice Cake, Nori Spiced Tuna Roll, Fried Rice and Churros. I wasn't a big fan of the Crunchy Jicama Shell Tostadas or the Branzino but the food was overall good. For drinks I enjoyed the Las Palmitas, which is a spicy drink mixed with grapefruit beer & bitters.  The service is pretty quick.

We signed up for the Gilt deal (4-course brunch and a bottle of prosecco) and it was so much food! We literally left in a food coma  For our first course we had the blueberry lime muffins - so moist and tasty I wanted some to take home! Second course was a mini burger, also very tasty. The chilaquiles are the best thing on the menu! It's tortilla chips with cheese (think nachos) and steak with this delicious sauce and an egg over everything - just excellent. Our side was the brussels with bacon - also to die for and a must order. Lastly, we had the churros with a spicy chocolate sauce, which I also highly recommend. Also, we made our own mimosas by adding fresh squeezed orange juice to our prosecco...so this is an option as well.The service was good, with some minor miscommunications. I would anticipate spending at least 2 hours here as they allow you a good deal of time for each course. The only downside was that the table next to us was snapchatting an Facetiming loudly throughout our meal.

2.0,3/5/2017,"I had seen Vandal all over Instagram as the place to be and after checking out their website and their prices I decided to make a reservation for my birthday for brunch for a party of nine.Visually, the place did not disappoint! The walls are covered in street art and every angle is a new snapshot for social media. The staff was also pretty good; friendly and helpful when needed. As for the food...we started off with two orders of fries and double smoked bacon. The bacon was amazing (and I am not a bacon fan) while the french fries were really salty. Five of us ordered the skirt steak fried rice and we were extremely disappointed. Taste wise, the steak was delicious but the rice was so oily! We ended up leaving most of the steak on the plate. It was very disappointing for a $24 meal. Another one of us ordered the Hong Kong waffles. The best thing about that plate was the chicken on top. Our grand total was $210...we rather spend $45 in a diner which is what we had to do afterwards since we couldn't even enjoy our meals. Not sure what their prices are for drinks but Vandal seems like a place better suited to go to at night with your friends (their lounge is downstairs) I wanted to experience something different but it wasn't worth it.

2.0,3/5/2017,"Let me start by stating I have dined at Vandal many times since their opening, and the food is excellent. This review is for the lounge ONLY. My party and I decided to buy bottles at Vandal, as it was a friend's birthday. I consider myself an avid club/lounge goer, so I pretty much know everything when it comes to clubs and nightlife. When I looked at the Bottle Menu, I immediately noticed that for a lounge, bottle prices were more expensive. Note that they only carry premium liquors. I understand it's Vandal, but they are also NOT 1OAK or TAO, nor do they provide the service of either. After selecting 2 bottles of Belvedere, my party and I (4 girls) wanted friends to join us. At this point it was 2am, so we walked upstairs and my friend (whose birthday it was) explained that she wanted two other friends to join our table. This would have placed the total number of guests to 6, which FOR TWO BOTTLES priced at 450 each, is more than acceptable. Obviously Vandal does not have a grasp on table minimum to guest ratio. When my friend went to speak to the bouncer, he was extremely rude telling her ""they were closed"" and ""too bad"". Mind you Vandal has a closing time of 4am (why we chose it in the first place) and the lounge was DEFINITELY not to capacity. My friend NICELY explained that it was her birthday, and these guests had driven in from Long Island to attend. The bouncer proceeded to call her obnoxious and uneducated, to which I immediately stepped in and demanded to speak with the host who had sold us the table to begin with. He ended up letting our friends in however one hour later (at 3am) they turned the lights on and threw everyone out. We had barely gotten through the second bottle. I won't spend money here again be it at the lounge or for dinner - until they realize they are not Beauty and Essex or TAO.",3,2,0,Colleen N.,"New York, NY",2,129,39

The drinks are on the pricier side, even for NY, but are strong and tasty. It was pretty crowded since it was Friday night but the bartenders were still friendly and very efficient. I loved making short videos in their photo booth and seeing all the different kinds of street art that adorned the walls. Very chic!On to brunch-I came here last Saturday with a Gilt deal for a 4-course brunch and a bottle of prossecco. The staff is great-I was running late for my reservation but that didn't seem to be an issue at all. On to the food-my boyfriend and I shared the coffee pancakes, which were fluffy and drizzled with an espresso caramel sauce and topped with pieces of dark chocolate and strawberries. Next, we had the mini burger, which was cooked perfectly and very appetizing. Then, we had the chilaquiles, which was my favorite course.

4.0,2/20/2017,"Came here for a birthday. Waited around 10 mins for our table to be ready. Easy to wait as we grabbed drinks at the bar. Waiter was extremely attentive and informative with the menu. Gave us his favorites and answered all our questions. Even noticed I had toilet paper on the back of my shoes & grabbed it quickly. Group of four girls and we had 8 plates all together. Very very full by the end of the meal! Tacos & Bao Buns was my favorite! The pretzel was a big hit as well as the octopus. I would have enjoyed the dumplings if I wasn't so full. Could barely finish the last tapa. Not a bad tasting tapa on the table. Food came out nice and steady - didn't wait long. The Double Dutch was nice and not overly sweet of a cocktail. Later, the waiter escorted us down to the lounge downstairs. Very large and open but filled up quickly around the hour of 1030-11. The bartenders were attentive. Sadly all the couches were reserved so we had to stand most of the night. The DJ was ok and got better as the night wore on. Crowd was mostly young women dressed to the nines and older European men.

2.0,2/19/2017,"The food was great but the service was horrible. There were plenty open tables when I arrived but the hostess decided to make us wait for 20 minutes before we were seated. I made a 3:30 reservation for bunch and was seated at 3:47: The server tells me that brunch is ending at 5 and the kitchen closes at 4 so I need to order because I have to leave at 5pm. I was extremely disappointed at the way the waiter handled the situation. I asked her why was I allowed to make a reservation if I would have to leave in a hour. She told me rules are rules sorry. I thought the situation could of been handled better. I ended up making a dinner reservation just so I could keep my table to eat. The service tonight was horrible. During dinner we had a different server and she came over to take our food before we were finished, brought us our check without us asking. It was clear she wanted us to leave.

The walls are covered in ""vandalism"" --beautiful images spray painted on and several walls that look like the brick has been chipped away in form of a human face. We went crazy and ordered practically one of everything-- Crispy Bao Buns, nori spiced tuna rolls (sounds like sushi but it's not), spicy Korean rice cakes (very flavorful), octopus huarache, jerk chicken tostones, flash seared tuna (perfectly seared, rare in the middle), grilled Brussels sprouts and crispy eggplant (delicious and not greasy--highly recommend as a side dish), baby beers--had potential but I felt they were undercooked and a little crunchy, and margarita pizza. There may be a few that I've forgotten. The food and the presentation were all very good. The waitstaff was also very attentive and polite.

1.0,2/13/2017,"I came here on a Saturday night around 12:30 AM with one friend for apps and drinks. The women in front is extremely rude. We are seated and 4 different waiters are servicing us. Each coming and asking the same questions (clearly not communicating with one another). A woman comes in to sit at the table next to us and knocks over a glass of water with her purse, it spills all over me, the hostess happened to be standing there so I kindly said ""can I please get assistance to clean this up and napkins to clean myself off - she VERY rudely says ""I'll tell a server"". She clearly didn't tell anyone because it was about 5 minutes until a server passed and I asked for assistance. We ordered a pizza and jerk chicken tostones. The pizza was ok (that would be pretty hard to mess up), the jerk chicken tostones were freezing cold and had no taste. Back to the drink spill - the woman who spilled the drink was apologetic and told the waiter she would pay for my drink to add it to her bill. Our bill comes - we ordered pizza, tostones, and had one drink each. There was a $58 drink charge. This clearly wasn't right wether the woman was paying for the drink or not. The drinks were $12 each. I let the server know (who is also VERY RUDE) - she insists its correct, so I had to explain in detail to her how it was not.She said she would get the waiter who told us he would remove the drink, he comes and also is insisting it was removed. After going back and forth for 5 minutes they both leave with the bill. They both come back with the CORRECT bill.... so now we have it corrected 2 times. Unreal and very unorganized!Conclusion - the ambiance, vibe and music are all good. Service and food are HORRIBLE! I wouldn't recommend anyone waste their time here.

3.0,2/12/2017,"Stopped by for Restaurant Week but opted to be a rebel and not try the pre fix menu. Despite having a reservation, my friend and I still had to wait about a half hour. Not bad considering some people have had to wait hours. If you will be in NYC for a while and can get another reservation, I would not wait more than an hour. That's just me.Service was surprisingly great. The waitress was persistent, which only annoyed me slightly since we had to wait despite having a reservation and I think 5 minutes to see the menu is not too much to ask. She did however pop up just when I needed water or to ask a question and I appreciated that. I sat in the back facing the wall while my friend got to sit in the booth along the wall. FYI, you don't want to sit where I did. I missed out on the excitement and ambiance since my view consistent of a concrete wall. OystersI loved the condiments that came with this. The oysters were a little on the small side but tasted great.Sticky Rice DumplingsGreat portion for two people. Nice subtle spicy flavor. I really enjoyed these.Shawarma SaladInteresting. Just tasted like romain with a lot of sauces. I almost forgot chicken was part of the dish since it was put in so sparingly.Blackened Shrimp ArepasThe Shrimp had a nice flavor and the cream was nicely spicy. The ""Arepas"" however tasted like little potato puffs. Not bad but not what I was expecting. Solid dish for two portion wise.Jerk SalmonThe salmon was great and the quinoa which is not my fav was also pretty tasty. Solid large plate. The Lounge:After dropping some serious $$$ I figured stopping by the lounge to see some art would be the obvious next step. Clearly Vandal and I are not on the same page. It was about 11:30pm on a Friday night and I was told that I could NOT go to a club that was in the same building as the establishment in which I just had dinner because I was not on a list.I am NOT the type of New Yorker to wait on lines or go to places with lists (that I am not automatically on). We are on the Bowery for crying out loud this is not Meatpacking. Did I mention the amount of $$$ i spent? I was told they do the whole list thing sometimes and I should come early. I don't understand how those party goers who choose to eat at the establishment first can be denied from entering another level. This section is me bitching NOT about not being considered as part of the ""cool kids"" but the fact I spent 4 hours at this place and didn't get any instagram worthy shots. Would I come back? Eh prob not on my own dime.The food was interesting and an experience but this is a place to go to say you did. Oh and they may want to make sure the mouse traps with fresh cheese cannot be seen, especially for what they are charging.

The Korean spicy rice cake was definitely a different (good different) twist to what I was used to as street food in Korean street foodThen the fish - main dish that our lovely waitress recommended was so good it was a grilled fish on a bamboo stick with a soy glaze and you were to eat it with this sweet & sour sauce which was like a party in my mouth. The skirt steak on top of the fried rice was good too and tasted kind of like the steak was glazed with gochujjang which is a spicy and slightly sweet Korean paste - it wasn't too spicy for those who are worried and really good tooFor dessert we had the churro which came with a melted chocolate dipping sauce - can someone please say a sweet treat in my mouth????Hats off to the chef ;),4,0,0,Jeong S.,"Queens, New York, NY",6,36,62

We had a 10:45 reservation, but decided to get there early to have some drinks, parking wasn't as hard as we originally anticipated. You first walk into a ""flower shop"" then through a door to the reservation area, we were given a beeper, and headed to the bar. There is a cool bunny sculpture in the main area, the place gets a 10+++++ was atmosphere! Beautiful unique art work on every wall. We were also lucky enough to find a seat at the bar! Talk about perfect timing, we ordered the only drink that has Hennessy, which is called (off the wall) it was very good, and damn was it strong! Our bartender was so personable! And kinda looked like Tom Cruise, we stood at the bar for a while getting drunk, talking to ""Tom"" who was also nice enough to do a ""buy back"" I haven't had a bar do that in forever!!! Right on time our table was ready, and the beeper went off (basically flashing lights) by this time the bar was PACKED! I guess I didn't notice because we were sitting down the whole time. We were seating in the front room, kinda makes you feel like you're outside, the waitress was amazing! And explained all the food we were interested in. Also making her own suggestions, which luckily we listened, because we enjoyed everything! We were going to have an entree, but because of all the alcohol in our system, by then...we decided to order a bunch of appetizers. Crispy Bao Buns- MY FAV!!!! must order! I wish I would have had my own order. Grilled Chilean sea bass tacos- another fav! Very very good!!! Red snapper tostadas- good, but small, would order again. Sticky rice dumplings- spicy!!!! The favors was unbelievable, but I have a very sensitive pallet, my husband sure didn't mind, and ate them all up. After eating all that, and also have more ""off the wall"" drinks, we decided that were having so much fun, that we will celebrate my birthday, which is still weeks away, because just in case we don't have this much fun, we can always say the first time was better! Lol So we ordered dessert, the vandel s'mores, which was out of this world! You would think by this point I had no more room to eat, but I couldn't resist, they also brought out a complementary cupcake with a candle, which was all chocolate, very rich in taste! Okay now on to the other things....music! Which was great! I wanted to get up out of my seat plenty of times to dance, which some people did. Yes the music is loud, so this isn't a place for a quiet romantic dinner. But yes you're able to have a conversation. They have a lounge downstairs, there is a line, also bottle service, the music was great down there also, I believe they were playing the same as upstairs. There's plenty of seating if you get there early, but by 2am the place is packed! But great vibes! I would highly recommend this place to anyone who needs a good night out!

4.0,2/5/2017,"Finally tried Vandal last Sunday night with a friend for NYC Restaurant Week. I've been wanting to try it out since it opened about a year ago. Passed the restaurant a bunch of times and of course it has a cool/trendy vibe like its sister restaurants. When you first walk in it's a flower shop (pretty cool stuff, but pricey! wonder if anyone ever buys anything there?) and then the main entrance to the restaurant is through the shop. The decor is beautiful & each room is quite different. My friend and I were seated in the front room, which kind of has an outdoorsy/garage type vibe. I believe when it's warm out the doors/windows open up, which would be really nice! We took a walk around the restaurant after our meal and the back rooms seemed to have a more lively vibe (a little loud), but that's ok we enjoyed sitting in the front as it wasn't loud and we could actually have a conversation. Unfortunately the downstairs lounge was closed, but would love to check it out on a weekend night for drinks. The food & drinks were great! We ordered the Double Dutch & Las Palmitas cocktails and both enjoyed them! The restaurant week menu seemed to have g options. We also ordered a few things off of the regular menu to supplement (which wasn't really necessary, but of course we ordered anyway). Would definitely recommend trying out Vandal! Appetizers: -Nori Spiced Tuna Roll: I honestly didn't love this at all and it wasn't what I was expecting. I was expecting a sushi type roll, but it had a crispy fried outside with raw tuna inside. I told them to hold the wasabi crema. Overall it was OK, but not what I was expecting or what I wanted.-Crunchy Jicama Shell Tostadas: My friend had these and seemed to really enjoy! I didn't try it, but it seemed that the shells were a bit too thin to hold the ingredients in the tostada -Heaven Spot Mini Burger: (Not on Restaurant Week Menu) We ordered 1 burger to share and it was just OK. I expected a lot better from all of the reviews on yelp & photos of the burger. We could've done without it.Main Dish: -Prime Skirt Steak: My friend & I both had this as our main and it was excellent! The steak was cooked perfectly medium rare. The fried sausage rice was awesome and a lot more filling than I expected. The egg on top was perfectly and tied the whole dish together. Really enjoyed it! Sides: -Crispy Eggplant: (Not on Restaurant Week Menu) AMAZING! Absolutely loved this and so glad we ordered. It was crispy small pieces of eggplant and soft inside. So delicious. Dessert: -Almond Joy Pops: I had these are they were really good! They fell apart quickly after just taking one bite, but they were very delicious! -Churros w/ Spicy Chocolate: My friend had these as her dessert & really liked them! I'm really not a churro person, but I did try and they were delicious. Not as doughy as other churros I've tried, which I actually prefer it to be crispy.",1,0,0,Alexa S.,"New York, NY",770,194,206

When you first step in, you step into a flower shop, and it's a little confusing, because it's a real flower shop! We walked all the way in and noticed the restaurant in the back. There, there is this super interesting and slightly trippy upside-down bunny that is the perfect photo op. We luckily had a reservation, so we were seated immediately. The entire place inside is a warehouse that used to be an old club and it's super cool and very underground NYC inside. My favorite part is actually the coffee cart that's randomly in one of the rooms, as it just adds to the intrigue of this place.My friend and I shared the Blackened Shrimp Arenas, Grilled Chilean Sea Bass Tacos and Churros.

If you're the type of person likes to SEE and BE SEEN and be surrounded by trendy downtowners and baby executives while waiting at the tiny bar for an ever-sought-after table in the dining room this place is the right spot for you. I made a reservation here for 4 people at 7:45. Once we all arrived at 7:45, we notified the hostess who then gave us a buzzer and assured us that ""people are finishing up and it shouldn't be too long"". Context clues told us that ""too long"" would actually be more like 20 minutes so we went to the bar to have a pre-dinner cocktail. The drinks were VERY good and the bartenders were very very nice. Steep prices ($17 a piece), but I recommend the Castor Troy (VODKA, SPICY) or the Las Palmitas (TEQUILA, ALSO SPICY). Once 50 minutes past, we went back to check and the hostess was EXTREMELY RUDE. Management interjected and offered to buy our table a glass of champagne each - which was so greatly appreciated. NOW ON TO THE FOOD - we had the restaurant week menu and one item from the regular menu. The standouts were: Steak tartar pretzel (MUST GET THIS SERIOUSLY SO GOOD), Skirt steak (also an amazing choice), Mushroom salad (tastes like truffle so #duh), espresso + Jameson shot (dessert - so good). Why 3 stars? The service was pretty terrible and the food was good, but not great for the prices and what you get.

If a restaurant is going to participate in restaurant week they should provide the same type of service that they would on any regular night. The food was one star out of five. We both got our main dish, the skirt steak and it was cold. Since both dishes were  cold we didn't think to ask the waiter until we were done and as the busboy came around to pick up our half eaten plates, we asked if it was normal for the food to be cold. He laughed and said definitely not. The rice was hard, and everything from the pork sausage to our medium skirt steak looked like beef carpaccio. So disappointed. But the desert was 5 out of 5. Come here for drinks and desert. The food is a major disappointment.",0,1,0,Samantha C.,"Jersey City, NJ",109,125,74

4.0,1/28/2017,"I had such a good time at Vandal! My friend and I went on  a Friday night with dinner reservations at 845pm. We arrived about 10 minutes early and the hostess gave us a pager and told us to wait around the bar area until our table was ready. The bar was packed, but the service was quick, and we were able to grab two seats. The bartender was very efficient and friendly. Our table was ready around 915, and we were taken to another area of the restaurant to be seated for dinner. The decor and vibe is really fun, our table had couch seating on one side and a chair on the other. Our server came over right away gave us menus and took our drink orders. As an appetizer we went with the cacio e pepe arancini which were outrageous, probably one of the best rice balls I've ever had. As an entree I went with the pork carnitas and my friend had the jerk spiced salmon, and we split a side of fries. The pork was delicious and so tender, it literally fell apart while trying to get a forkful. The pork comes with small plain tacos on the side so you can make little tacos if you want, and it also comes with three different sauces on the side, none of which I really cared for. The one complaint I do have about the pork is that it was a bit on the salty side. My friend really enjoyed the salmon. Oh and the fries were fried perfectly, they were so crunchy and delicious. Overall I had a great experience here and will definitely be back. The service was great and all of the staff was really nice and friendly.",4,0,3,Jessica R.,"Brooklyn, NY",169,216,594

3.0,1/25/2017,"I had planned an evening at Vandal for my birthday on Thursday 1/19 with some close friends of mine. I actually called twice prior to my arrival and spoke with 2 different representatives and was assured both times that the lounge would be available and that no reservation was needed since I planned to arrive at 7pm, prior to peak time. When I arrived that evening, I was told there was a private event happening until 830pm. I mentioned to the doorman and also to the hostess inside that at no time when I had called prior was I informed about a private party. I was extremely upset upon arrival to hear this news and had to scramble to inform my guests who were also arriving to meet me at another location inside Vandal. Fortunately one of the hostesses ushered me into a lounge area facing Bowery where I could at least meet my guests until the private party was over. I was then told the lounge would not be open at 830 as originally informed when i arrived, but now it would be at 9:30p. I will say the one bright spot was our server upstairs in the lounge facing Bowery (can't recall his name but he had dark hair, beard and glasses). He was extremely accommodating to myself and my guests and was very pleasant and helpful to us. We finally got downstairs just after 930, only to find that all tables were already reserved at the time. Not the way I had hoped to kick off my birthday celebration. A few of my friends and I stayed for a few minutes downstairs, but ended up leaving shortly thereafter. I did enjoy the food and the service upstairs, but again very dismayed that my birthday celebration had to be cut short due to poor communication about the availability of the downstairs lounge.

1.0,1/23/2017,"I just really did not like this restaurant. I did not like the food at all. I asked for Medium cooked skirt steak and it was basically raw. The rice that came with it was pretty spicy as well. And the random egg on top was not necessary. The appetizers were OK. We tried the mushroom appetizer and the zucchini appetizer. Nothing to rave about.The dessert was actually really good however. We tried the black and white cake($15), the Jameson shots($8), and they also brought out a FREE cupcake because we were celebrating a birthday. All in all though, the drinks are overpriced. The entire place is overpriced. We went downstairs to their downstairs lounge. It's very crowded and gets pretty hot down there. The ceilings are really low. I'm pretty sure it's the basement and they turned it into a fancy bar area with bottle service tables as well. Getting a drink at the bar is an almost impossible task. We ordered a drink and with only 2 bartenders, it took about 15 minutes to get it. We didn't stay long.A cocktail/glass of wine, whether upstairs or downstairs, starts at $16+tax.Only good thing about this place is the ambience and the hostesses/waitress/bartenders. They were all really sweet.I will definitely not be back nor would I recommend this place to anyone.

Upon entrance you'll have two options: left to the breakdancing purple bunny (take a picture like everyone else) and bar area with ""tapas"" or right to the more formal table for dinner service. I recommend either, but I'll especially talk about the left side and nightlife that hides below Vandal's venue. Considering the drinks are fancier and a bit more expensive, definitely come here for an occasion and it will be a blast. Grab some drinks, grab some plates of food, and then once you've become sufficiently inebriated head downstairs to the ""lounge / club"" where you'll have awesome spinning beats and more bars and drinks to keep your night going.

In the middle of the meal after we finished our appetizers and we wanted to order more we could not because the Waiter took our menu. Me and my friend were starring at each other for 15 minutes until I got up and went to the front desk and complained about the poor service. The women at the front said she would take care of it. When our waiter came back to give us the menus after I had complain, his attitude was 10x worse then before. As for the food, it was alright. Tuna nori roll was not that fresh and the mushroom salad was nothing special.

I had the jerk chicken tostones - if you are even remotely familiar with authentic jerk chicken or tostones, do not order this, you will be sorely disappointed. My large dish was the crispy chicken and hong kong egg waffles with braised collard greens. The collard greens were delicious, the rest of the dish was disappointing partially because i was expecting more traditional chicken and waffles with a sweet syrup and this dish comes with two savory sauces drizzled all over it, neither sauce was explained or mentioned on the menu. Both dishes were lukewarm at best and just weren't tasty. On the upside one person in our group ordered the mushroom pizza and that was a hit, as well as the fries.Pros: Decor         Atmosphere - vibe/music         Optional Coat Check         Friendly ManagerCons: Way overpriced for quality and portion size of the dishes.            Menu descriptions too vague considering food interpretations are not traditional. Hard                  to know what you'd really be getting.           Service was mediocre, I'll give our waiter the benefit of the doubt and say it was because he had several tables at once, but you don't expect slow service on a Monday night.Overall, it was an experience but very unlikely that I'll return.",0,0,0,Elizabeth P.,"Bronx, NY",0,5,0

We were first seated in the large room in the front (the one you can look into from the street), which was not nearly as poppin as the other rooms. We noticed the difference in vibe and asked if we could be reseated at the bar, since we weren't eating anyway. The waitress was great in saying yes of course, they'll clear some space at the bar, but probably forgot to actually do it. We ended up milling around the bar, looking for space, then ending up back in that room and chilling on the sofas. It definitely felt like we were forgotten once they had moved us.The drinks themselves: I ordered something off the spicy section. It had a kick to it, which was unfortunately almost entirely masked by the sweetness. Prices were typical to NYC. The place itself looked great and had great ambience.",1,1,1,Stella A.,"San Francisco, CA",547,118,58

1.0,12/17/2016,"I would give them 0 stars if I could, the woman managing the door at the lounge was DISCRIMINATORY at entrance to the lounge- allowing all our party of 7 in but the 2 DOCTORS OF COLOR, this is the new TRUMP NATION. THIS IS NOT A ISOLATED INSODENT, READ REVIEWS POSTED BY OTHERS. We had dinner and ate our hearts out with no discretion on cost. I believe we had almost everything on the menu and a couple bottles of champagne for a party of 7- not even exaggerating, we like to try everything and it was a night of celebration. Went to enjoy the downstairs lounge and they let my entire table in but the 2 DOCTORS that were part of our party. How disappointing for 5 of us out of the 7 to be enjoying the lounge and realize 2 people are missing. I even talked to the manger of the restaurant and he said he would let us in after confirming our party dined with a reservation, but the TRUMP girl working the line was pushing bottle service so he was at her mercy for their poor service in the lounge- as she was forcing them to purchase bottle service ""due to the size of the party."" WHY? To prove people of color can afford your establishment? But it seems the requirements to accommodate the entrance of our entire party  by the restaurant manager were adequate but the ill TRUMP girl at the door kept changing the requirements as we met each standard she wanted us to MEET. IT SEEMS WE MET THE MENTAL TRUMP WALL. The sad part is that we are aware that a place like this thrives on sales and came out with no budget and willing to spend whatever to ensure a good time- why do I need to prove it with bottle service? Seriously, take a look at what we spent on dinner- do you think we care? POOR, POOR BEHAVIOR AND JUDGMENT on the woman that was managing the door. She had no skills in customer service and was dressed like a child with no effort on her personal appearance, I can't believe they allowed her to work. DISGUSTING TO NOT ALLOW MY BROTHER WITH A CRAZY WORK SCHEDULE TO ENJOY A RARE NIGHT TOGETHER BECAUSE YOU WANT A BOTTLE SALE TO SHOW  TO THE OWNER.

My recommendations: bao buns, mini burgers, cacio e Pepe arancini, the krispy eggplant. Skip the jerk chicken tostones. They aren't tostones they are pretty much small plantain chip with meat on them...not worth it. Wish we tried something else. The dessert, the bread pudding was delish, I'd skip the smores. The ice cream that came with smores pie was delish. The lounge was fun, the music was really good. There are bouncers. We went to dinner about 6 and went down to the lounge about 8.

The fairy lights and dim lighting created a cozy and romantic feeling, and the seats were comfortable and spacious. We ordered a couple small dishes, including the red snapper tostada, the crab tostada, the mango mojito ceviche, and the fried chicken and egg waffle. On average, the food was okay. I was greatly disappointed by the chicken and waffle. I've had egg waffles since I was 3 because it's a HK snack. I was very excited to see that they had this asian fusion dish on the menu, but the egg waffle was poorly made. The dough was green but tasteless. It was flat and lacked a fluffy yet crispy texture. Also, the chicken was super dried. But I did enjoy the tostadas. They were fun, bite-sized cuties with a variety of textures. After dinner, we moved inside by the bar, and it felt like a totally different place. Great music, delicious drinks, and good energy.

I read a few of the reviews before attending the dinner, but still decided to support my friend for her birthday. We had 11:30 reservations, FYI reservations means nothing to them, upon arrival we were given a pager and were told it was a wait. Birthday girl asked how long was the wait, Hostess didn't respond. When the question was repeated she was rude and standoff-ish, to only be told we'd have to wait 30mins which really was an hour wait.No where to stand, a female security guard suggested we head down to the lounge during the wait. We stood online, watch them let in several people in. No one else on line, we were ignored for about 5 mins. Finally the door girl looked at us ""are you on the guest list? We have a guest list in order to get in."" She never had a list, and didn't ask anyone before us about a list. I felt we were discriminated from entering. I watched them for 30 mins let people in, and turn people away. The staff is not friendly, the food isn't worth the hassle you are put through.

1.0,12/11/2016,"My review is mostly based on the customer service aspect of their business. Other than that I'd give them a 2.5. I went here two nights ago to celebrate a friends birthday, she picked this place because of the vibe, trendy ambiance, club feel even though it's a restaurant. The drinks were good and the meal we ate (red snapper) was okay. The waiter we had was very standoffish seemed like she rather not be serving our table, to the point I had to look for someone else to help me highlight the fact it was my friends birthday and we wanted to do a little something at the table for her.As we were exiting my friend realized her purse was missing. We immediately went back to the table where she left it and of course it was gone. Now she starts to panic because her money, card and most importantly house keys were in there. She brought it to the attention of the staff and no one seemed to want to go out their way to help her figure out who/when someone grabbed it. At this point she starts freaking out getting emotional because she feels as though no one in this establishment cared enough to try to help figure out what was going on. Security (a Hispanic manly woman) decides to place hands on me the bystander to my friend and push me outside and then returns to do the same to my friend. This is when HELL breaks loose. Security at this point is more worried about her being emotional about someone stealing her purse rather than helping her figure out what happened. Promises from guards to check that cameras were made to pacify her with us standing outside in the cold for over an hour waiting to hear back. No one followed up about her purse they just kicked us out and left us there. Cops were called and head of security (white guy with a beard) came outside pretending to help but never returned. OVERALL: Would I return there? No, the level of service was not worth a returning trip. The way they treat ""brown"" people was very degrading. At their sister business another one of my friends had an issue with waiters being rude and not wanting to serve them. I gave Vandal the benefit of the doubt and decided to try them out and I left with a completely sour taste in my mouth. Security didn't have to be such assholes, and could've handled it very differently. Although my friend got emotional and loud it was justified. Her energy was fueled by their lack of empathy and the way they were speaking to her in a demeaning disrespectful unhelpful tone. For anyone interested, it's two days later, security or staff has yet to get back to us about her purse. She had to cancel her card, had to take an L for 300$ that was in said stolen purse and we had to break into my friends apartment just so she could sleep in her own bed on her ruined birthday.

Food was decentWaitstaff is nothing to comment on as they were basically taking the order with little communication.Now the absolute disgusting and blatant disrespect and bottoming racism was experienced at the entrance to their lower level bar area. I was with very close friends of mine. 8 white friends and 1 other black male friend. Our white female friends talked with the door girl to allow us access to meet the rest of our group. The door girl looked at me and my other black male friend and she quickly without a thought said NOOOO!! My white female friends then proceeded to ask well can you get my other 3 friends in ( 2 white females and 1 white male) the door girl quickly without a thought said YESSS..WITHIN the same 3 seconds we were denied entrance purely on the color of our skin and separated from our group. Luckily our group noticed the disgusting action and quickly went downstairs to gather the rest of the group and leave the entire venue all together.

I made a reservation online for 2 when I arrived none cared to even ask me how they could help us. And when we tried to go to the club downstairs, we were told we had to be on the guestlist, and I showed my email confirmation I got from opentable.com only to be told the reservation I had made was only for the restaurant, not the club.  So I asked how to get on the guestlist, instead of telling us how, this stupid girl simply told me there was no more room downstairs, but a second later I saw new customers getting admitted to the same basement we had just got denied access to.  I don't know if I should call this discrimination or whatever, but really this place should be closed down. Security guards and bouncers, please tell us the reason for selective admission. It always annoys me when these bouncers act stupid on customers especially when I remember they are doing it for a salary that's below the minimum wage.

Mind you, I'm several drinks in and trying to calculate a 20% tip because our waitress was amazing. I finish signing and he snatches the bill out of my hand with an attitude...RUDE! I couldn't believe the disrespect. And after I got up, no one sat in the booth I was in. No one. So what was so urgent Humberto? Please tell me. He should lose his job because he's not good at it.

So we're at the bar and I feel something wet on my feet. I look over and there's a guy at the bar taking a piss. Even after getting caught he continued and lied about it after the fact. So we told security who acted like they didn't believe us and finally after about 10-15 minutes or so they kicked the guy out. That was 10 minutes too long for me.

She called for the server to possibly change it and ask for something else. The server said ""sorry kitchen is closed"" and walked away...Terrible customer service. What made this experience even worst was we had to wait an hour and some change before we received our food. Unfortunately after waiting so long that member of our party ended up not eating because the server claimed the kitchen was closed. :( We were really looking forward to having a wonderful experience here, it's so sad how disappointed we were when we left.

And on an added note, I got a ton of really neat snap chats in and a good insta so that's a major win. The concept of the restaurant is that it is based on the best street food from around the world. The restaurant itself is huge, and has a lot of rooms that each have different vibes based on the type of art work in the room. We were with a large party of 10, and actually asked to switch rooms (betchy) so that we could be in a more fun atmosphere, and they were very accommodating.Starting off with the drinks, I stuck to cocktails for the night. I had the pushcart wars (a spicy tequila drink so you know that is just speaking to my heart) as well as the off the wall. Both of them were great, and they had a ton of others that sounded fantastic.Since we were at a large group work dinner we had the privilege of ordering a ton of stuff to share which was the following.

Don't ask me how I heard about it, or why, since I really don't like the menu, but it seemed like lots of celebs had been going there, and that it was just trendy. I was incredibly shocked, but also amazed, and SO happy when patch surprised us with a reservation here! So trendy. You have to get reservations months in advance!We got there for our reservation (10:30), and they still made you wait. This was Portnoy's complaint too, so Patch was not too happy. We went into the crowded bar area, and ordered $16 cocktails. My drink was amazing, but almost too good, as I don't remember much else of the evening... whoops. We finally were seated, and were a little flustered when ordering. Everything I wanted, I was allergic to. I gave her 4 options, and only was able to have one of them, which was a salad. Granted, I don't even like salads.. but we were at a trendy place! Overall, none of us were too impressed with our food. I would recommend coming here for cocktails, but it isn't worth the hassle for eating.What really sets vandal apart, and what is worth the pricetag of the drink, is the vibe, atmosphere, decoration.

Just saying...Service- I don't know why, but I found everyone who worked there nice contrary to all the negative reviews. My waitress was a 20 something in the last room against the back wall with the mural before the ramp for the bathrooms. She was so sweet! Maybe because I'm a lifelong NY'er, I didn't think anyone was disrespectful or pretentious at all.It's NY, you aren't in Daniel, deal with it that this is NY. If you are a transplant and don't like to spend money, this isn't the place for you.Scene- holy amazing. It's the place to see and be seen. If you're a 1980's kid and grew up listening to biggie and wu; this is the spot for you. Hip hop with dinner. Sold. Graffiti and street art. Loved. I'm a Brooklyn born Italian girl- it was just a perfect marriage of street and art.Food- the place was packed. Me and my girl had an 11:15 reservation and that is when I would go every single time. We sat right down, in a spacious table, secluded in the back of the restaurant below the ramp before the bathroom. Perfect spot to people watch and to see the runners bringing my next course! We had the pretzel steak tartar. Not bad, but I'm not a raw steak person. The burgers, I didn't love. But that was just me. My friend loved hers. I should have ordered it burnt because I hate meat medium rare. The BLT pizza- YES! Sundried tomatoes and pancetta. Sold! Very very good. Bao buns! Holy the best thing I ever ate. Dessert- smore yes!

To go to a restaurant owned by a celebrity chef and pay those prices and not get anything that was even above average was a disappointment.  I've had far better meals for much less in NYC.

Enter this trendy restaurant through a dimly lit flower shop on Bowery and emerge into a foyer with blaring new school and old school tunes that play in each of the unique dining rooms. The hostess won't seat you without your entire party but be sure to check in and enjoy any one of many signature cocktails at the bar. By request, I was seated in the front garden themed room, but I recommend the back area. It has a more sophisticated vibe, but the food options are the same in all areas of the restaurant.Make sure you're hungry and ready to enjoy Vandal's twist on street food. I recommend the blackened shrimp arepas, grilled Chilean sea bass tacos, lobster and chicken paella, and tuna crudo. All of these were bursting with flavor and were the first to go at my table. Steer clear of the charred broccoli rabe and the New York steak tartare. The broccoli rabe was too charred and the tartare was not great. Remember everything is meant to be shared. Order 4-6 plates per every three people and you should be satisfied. With cocktails and food, my group paid about $80 per person plus tip.

If I can give 10 stars for ambiance and decor I definitely would. This place is the perfect place for taking Instagram photos and posting snap chat stories. The food is horrible! Even though a friend told me prior that I should go somewhere else I still choose to keep my reservation and little to my surprise she was right. I ordered the salmon and the quinoa. The quinoa was either over or under cooked. It was so crunchy it had the same texture of granola. The drinks were mediocre and very pricey. The music was also very bland, I'm not sure what the dj was thinking but the music choice was poor. I'm glad this was my pre birthday dinner and not my actual birthday dinner.

There was an unfortunate incident which occasionally occurs in any restaurant. We immediately brought it to the attention of our server who had the manager at our table in less than 5 minutes. They apologized profusely and before we knew it, we had a free round of drinks and a huge selection of desserts spread out before us at the end of our already filling meal.  The worst part of this experience is unfortunately very common in NYC, the ambient noise level.

And just a taste of these dishes was so not enough, but after 3 amazing speciality cocktails, 10 tapas plates, and some of the most sensual deserts to have ever passed my palate I was ready for a nap, and then, a night on the town.. When you're in NYC you better live!!! On your way out but certainly while you're enjoying your meal take some time to take in all of the original local artwork that is on every wall of this great joint.

After 1,5 hrs, we canceled some of the orders as we still didn't get them.

4.0,9/30/2016,"I came here with a group of 10 people for a work outing last night. As the meal was comped we went all out and ordered a good portion of their menu so I had the chance to taste much more than I would have normally got to try. I guess getting reservations here is tough but I didn't have to deal with that either. I can certainly see how that would be the case, the space is beautiful, the service was friendly, and the food and drinks were masterfully curated and prepared. As the name suggests the restaurant has a theme where you're constantly surrounded by types of street art and the menu is their upscale take on traditional street food.It was a turn off that there's a bouncer by the front door checking people's bags and I'm sure their lounge/bar area has bit of a clubby douchey vibe to it so that's worth noting. It's also worth noting that Vandal is one of Chris Santos's places (who is also the guy behind The Stanton Social and Beauty & Essex). It should be pointed out that some of the prices here are out of hand, luckily I didn't have to pay so I didn't let that weigh too heavily on my review though it probably should have. Of the 7 savory dishes and 4 desserts I tried the best two things I ate here that I've never had something nearly as good before was their crispy bao buns ($19 for an order of 3) and the prime skirt steak ($38 for a large meal sized portion). The bao buns were these super buttery melt in your mouth grilled rolls filled with the most tender and flavorful brisket I have ever had, topped with an asian slaw. For the skirt steak, I normally hate skirt steak because I don't like the texture of it and it's normally fairly rubbery even when cooked correctly. Well Vandal worked some sort of magic on this cut of meat because it was so incredibly tender and perfectly prepared that it mind as well been filet mignon. It came pre sliced on a heaping mound of chinese sausage fried rice with a sunny side up egg. Some other stand outs for me was the blue corn al pastor quesadillas ($17) which were basically crispy tortilla sandwiches filled with roasted pork and topped with pineapple salsa and avocado. The flavors just blended so well together with the sweet and savory and the crispy and tender. Their mini burgers were also absolutely amazing but at $9 each I'd save that money and go with something a little more creative like the dishes I already mentioned. All the desserts were wonderful but I particularly loved the greek donuts with honey ice cream ($15). If you're on a tight budget Vandal probably isn't for you but if you're not and want a beautiful and delicious dining experience Vandal is definitely one to consider.",2,1,2,Matt E.,"Brooklyn, NY",785,2205,1856

Staff first told us we couldn't hang out at the bar because we didn't order. And then as I dropped my bag to put on a jacket, a tall huge man kept asking me in a threatening way that bags are not allowed. Anyone in my shoes would feel mortified with someone almost trying to take you out of the club.I complained to staff, who then accommodated us better and gave us champagne. Little did I know this was a temporary fix.After I had paid my dinner bill, staff went after me and not my other friends. They were repeatedly telling me of not signing my check. It went on for minutes until my other friend realized it was him. So why accuse me? Because I had the bravado to complain? I left feeling disgusted. Tasteless food, like the vapid venue itself, reinforced my feeling.I wish I could give an extra star for the champagne.

1.0,9/21/2016,"If zero stars was an option, Vandal would get it. When I first heard that we were coming here, I was excited. I've heard good things about this spot and that the hype was real. Thing is - it is absolutely not. I would pick every other restaurant in Manhattan over Vandal. I don't think I've ever been treated with so much disrespect.We were a party of six with a reservation made in weeks in advance. They were still preparing our table and we were early so we started at the bar with cocktails while we waited for our table. The cocktails were nothing special and not worth the high price tag. I expected better from the same group that came up with the Notorious F.I.G. We waited a while and brushed off any rude/short answers to them being busy.An hour and a half later of trying to get a waitresses' or bartender's attention to get drinks (we only got three/four the first round between all of us because it was so hard to flag down someone or have them remember us), we finally got a table. When we would inquire about our table, we were asked to wait. 1.5 hours after the time of reservation and making a reservation and showing up early? I think not. We began inquiring after waiting for 45 minutes, just requesting an estimate. Shutting someone down when they're asking you a simple question, not pushing anyone out of the way or cutting you off to do so, is not the way to go. Finally, we got yet another eye roll and our table.We sat down and order a fair amount of items on the menu. The food was not memorable. Memorable in the sense that I felt that I needed to go to the gym afterward because it was so heavy. The service was again terrible. We had to track down any staff. Orders were taken with attitude. Eye rolls. Short answers. Cue ""FINE. I'll get that for you"" in a sarcastic tone. You come to Vandal if you want to be treated terribly and want to overpay for food that's not memorable. But a medium-sized party that obviously is there to spend money should not be treated so disrespectfully.Bottom line: the absolutely terrible service can't make up for the vibes and food. You're better off going anywhere else - including random halal carts on random streets.",14,5,1,Kathryn T.,"New York, NY",352,427,2878

While the menu is interesting there isn't anything too unique here, so it winds up feeling a bit overpriced. However, you do pay for the fun atmosphere.

Our waitress was very knowledgeable about the menu, she knew it by heart, so we chose all the most popular items.

I went for brunch on a Sunday at 1pm and the place was fairly empty which was great we got to pick the best seat in the house. The brunch menu was definitely unique on their part. I ordered the coffee pancakes and they were so good, the bloody mary drink and the coffee all was great. Reason I m giving it four stars is our waitress towards the end of our stay was just straight out rude! I was shocked by her attitude that I wanted to punch her in her face and I certainly did not hold back giving her an attitude right back, foolish on her part since she got nasty right before paying the bill and tipping her. Anyhow aside from that me and my friends loved the place. The flower shop is gorgeous with the most beautiful display of flowers.

1.0,9/17/2016,"RacistsI came in to the club with around 10 friends. The hostess refused to let me enter by making up many excuses such as that I was not on the guest lists. The first time I tried to enter the club when my friends were already inside the club (none of them were on the guest list) they turned me down because apparently I was not on the guest list. The first excuse slowly turned out to be false because my white friends were allowed entry who came after me even though they were not on the guest list. When I went in again to ask them why I was inquired I was informed it was because of ratio reasons. The second time I asked my group to come out, there were more girls than guys in the group and then the hostess informs me that I am not on the guest list and that I can't enter because guests from inside can't bring in guests from outside. Which didn't make sense - obviously my friends will come to the door to bring me in! When I informed the hostess that she contradicted herself twice by giving false reasons she refused to entertain me and asked the bouncers to remove me from the line.  Doesn't take a genius to see what's happening. I don't like pulling the race card, but racism has never happened to me before. I guess it hurts right in the middle when something you think you are free from in New York City happens to you!

I'm sorry don't take a customer service job if you DON'T know how to take an order. Admittedly, we were late for our rezi so we headed straight to the bar for some drinks until we could find an alternate table. There were more and more people piling in as the night went on. It became quite clear that this was the place to be ""seen"" I asked the Maitre'D if we could get seated elsewhere and she obliged.Well or at least I thought so...We were barraged by another hostess asking us how we got our table? Wow, the seating wasn't French Laundry esque my dear. She continually repeated the same question like a Sea Lion at Sea World. Finally, after arguing back and fourth for a while she agreed to take accountability on Vandal's behalf. To calm our tensions, she offered a round of free drinks. It was the least Vandal could do after multiple experiences with untrained staff. Furthermore, we were forced to share a small table that could barely fit our waters and appetizers until it became clear that the dishes would fall to the ground if they failed to realize the circumference of the table.I had fun with my friends here regardless but I wouldn't come back strictly based on service.

For dessert we had the churros which were amazing and the espresso shots. The drinks were really strong which I liked considering the prices of them. For thee people I believe the bill was 215. It was a little steep considering the little amount of food you get but I think it was worth it. Only con I felt was our waiter was a little dry , they asked us like three times back to back if they can clear the table meanwhile we were still working on our food, and one of the Waitresses going to two different tables to sing happy birthday with a cupcake until she found the right one which was ours.

First of all of if you can honestly put pickled soy sauce flavored cabbage in jerk chicken empanadas well then you haven't realized Asian fusion went out of fashion in 2005. Every dish I tried pretty much tasted and smelled like a homeless mans sweaty ass crack. Your sliders were good but if you were going for Burger King. Your price doesn't match.  You advertise yourself as street food but I think anything coming out of a halal truck is far superior to whatever Chinese ass sweat you serve.  I thought Tao was bad but you just managed to make a shitty franchise even worse.  Nice decor though.,1,0,0,Peter F.,"Manhattan, NY",39,83,4

1.0,9/1/2016,"If you wanted a more pretentious gobbledygook masquerading as an upscale restaurant/club, look no further than Vandal. The latest regurgitation from the Tao Group, Vandal nails on all points at making the restaurant feel like it's more than it actually is. If you are going to Vandal for the food, you are doing it wrong. Honestly, just read Ryan Sutter's Eater article on Vandal which encapsulates the dining experience. Out of the 10 dishes we ordered, the only decent dish was their mushroom pizza (then again how can you mess up pizza?).The only redeeming feature of Vandal is the downstairs club/lounge that provides an escape from the whole boondoggle of a restaurant upstairs. However, even this comes with the nasty caveat of having to impress the bouncers in front of the scantily clad velvet rope entrance and even scantier clad hostess. The air of faux exclusivity was the final straw that broke any hope of redemption to this ""clubstaurant."" After having spent a table's worth on food, our group of 3 women and 3 men was told that the downstairs was packed and that we would not be getting in (mind you it was 10 PM). We finally got down there after splitting up the group and the place had about 20 people. Listen, if you want to pay a lot of money to get treated like garbage more power to you. There are so many better restaurants and clubs in New York that would gladly take your money and at least give you good food and/or treat you with respect.",4,2,0,Paul C.,"New York, NY",484,13,8

5.0,8/25/2016,"I had been waiting for months to finally get to visit Vandal and I was not disappointed.I made a reservation for 6 people and, unfortunately, half the party was late, but luckily, they did not give up our table and we were able to wait at the bar until everyone arrived. My girlfriends and I had a couple drinks that varied in alcoholic strength, but overall, good drinks.Once our entire party was there, we were sat down and greeted by our server. He was super friendly and was a huge help in deciding what we were going to order. We had already picked out about 3 medium dishes, 2 large dishes and 2 sides to share, but it's always nice to have that confirmation that we ordered enough food at a tapas-style restaurant.Almost everything we ordered was GREAT. Out of all the dishes we ordered, I definitely enjoyed the sticky rice dumplings and lobster & chicken paella the most (did not eat that rabbit sausage though...). The one thing you should not get is the broccoli rabe side. The taste is literally like eating smoke because the flavor from charring it is just that strong.The best part of the meal (and something I didn't mention in the beginning) was that we were given a free dessert to share and a special large cupcake for me because we were celebrating my engagement! That was a really amazing and sweet surprise and I was very grateful for the amazing service.After our meal, we were invited to check out the lounge downstairs. Nice look, good space, but we weren't sure about the vibe. Was it for sitting? dancing? just lounging? Either way, we stayed for a few drinks (our female bartender was GORGEOUS by the way) and then headed out still so full from all the food and drink we just consumed.An A+ evening and I cannot wait to go back!",4,1,2,Jennifer C.,"Great Neck, NY",170,188,276

2.0,8/24/2016,"So, I will start off with how amazing the service staff is and how incredible the decor is.. For all the hype behind this place, sadly my BF and I were not impressed. To be clear the small and medium dishes are tapas , portions are decent but it's slim pickings when it comes to taste. We had the shrimp arepas, which were very good definitely get this dish. Also the scallop ceviche was ehhh but not too bad, very small.Next we had the pretzel kobe beef Tatare, stay away from this dish, it's crap! This grade of beef was done wrong, bland, Luke warm and just a huge miss. Moving on we decided on the sea bass tacos which were,  OK, nothing crazy and not worth the money. The corn tortillas were Soggy and were barely holding up to the sub par filling.The crispy boa buns on the other hand were down right delicious!  Best part of the meal! We even ordered  an extra bun ! This dish gets one star all on its own. The second star would be for the service and atmosphere which again was very pleasant.The larger dishes were a range of Asian fusion to America. Nothing really stood out so we decided to pass, although the pork chop did sound interesting at 24oz occopanied by a bacon aioli so maybe try that.In short, order the crispy boa buns, while you wait for your food take a few pics of the artwork and then leave. We won't be back. Sorry vandal, you tried.",2,1,0,Stephanie A.,"Keasbey, NJ",0,2,0

2.0,8/22/2016,"There is clearly a disparity when the strongest item on the menu at Chef Chris Santos' Vandal is a mini cheeseburger.Vandal is the most recent venture from the Tao Group. Patrons enter this lounge and restaurant hybrid through an innovative botanical shop with an inky black setting, Ovando. The surface area sets a striking contrast against the bouquets of blooming floras and lush green succulents encased in glass terrariums. Behind the door, erected in a warehouse spanning over 22,000 square feet, lies Vandal. This massive space is embellished with over seven elaborate graffiti murals and an Instagram-trending purple lacquer bunny. To compliment the setting, Vandal's fare is comprised of street food but far from street prices. Small and medium plates are tapas sized, shareable between two, and average $20 each. Although the plates achieve an aesthetic appeal, its contents completely miss the mark on taste. Their signature is the New York Hot Pretzel Steak Tartare ($17), the lovechild of a Parisian bistro and NYC street cart. Mashed Kobe beef is folded with egg yolk, capers, aioli, and spread over a hollow baked pretzel. Crushed pretzel pieces, parsley, and mustard seeds are sprinkled on top. The raw mush arrived to the table at a tepid temperature which was unusual and frankly, unappetizing. The Sticky Rice Dumplings ($17) are savory pastries made of glutinous rice flour and starch. The dough was stuffed with diced Chinese-barbeque pork, rolled into perfect spheres, deep fried, and stacked over a glossy pool of soy glaze. The filling was over-cooked and bland. The theme of disappointment continued with heartburn inducing Crispy Bao Buns ($19) and peaked with the Banh Mi'eatball Slider ($9) which was counterfeit, failing to resemble anything close to its original form. All flavors were dominated by the presence of excessively sour pickles. ""Mi'eat-diocre"" was more suitable. Vandal's kitchen makes a respectful attempt at reconstructing simple recipes but stumbles.Some Pro Tips: Mellow tunes, like Don't You Evah by Spoon, are replaced by heavy hitter hip hop jams during peak hours.",6,3,2,Kelly P.,"Manhattan, NY",374,130,473

3.0,8/20/2016,"Pretty underwhelmed with Vandal, but I can't wait try try Chris Santos' other restaurants. Came here for a birthday dinner. Keep in mind that there are people everywhere ready for photo ops. Literally there are people standing around even in the dining rooms taking pictures of the art and whatnot. Didn't try the drinks here but orders a few things. The best item was the blue quesadilla. Items that were ok were the steak tartare on the pretzel and the Greek donuts. The pretty bad items were the bao buns, the black and white crepe cake and the arepas.I can speak for the bao since I'm the one that had that but it truly had a really gross smell to it and the brisket was heavy with soy sauce and really looked like dog food! The whole time there were servers who didn't know who's dish was who's, some people said they never got a dish they ordered, some people got two or three of the same dishes they ordered. It was just a mess but the staff was pretty nice about it. The staff is quick to clean up though. They want to take the food right from under your nose. Also we we just finished paying and they are already cleaning the table as we were getting up. The busboy is in my way as I'm trying to leave, juggling all these glasses of water near me. Otherwise, it's good for photo ops I guess. But you should really be going to a restaurant for food. And the ratio of good items to bad items doesn't balance out well.",3,2,1,Valerie F.,"Queens, NY",101,103,345
1.0,8/20/2016,"Vandal I really wanted to like you! I really did but you have no class! I came here for a birthday celebration. My best friend really wanted to come here. Like all Chris Santos restaurants expect the fausade up front. In this case the flower shop. Walk past it and you find yourself transformed into a loungy environment. Having tried both beauty and Essex and staton social I think this place is the less formal of the three. They don't enforce any kind of dress code. So you can walk in wearing trucker hats and dirty sweat pant sweaters. Which was what various men decided would be appropriate for dinner and lounge.Drinks: I tried the misdemeanor. Very strong and tasty upstairs. The bartender on the main floor was on point. This is a tapas style menu with plates ranging from small, medium and large. They had various sides as well. We had about 10 different plates between the group. Of the 10 or so plates, the only two that were memorable was the mushroom pizza and the scallop ceviche. Both were so tasty and full of flavors. I wished they had the ceviche as a large plate because I could just eat that all day and be in heaven. The rest of the dishes were not memorable, hence why I can't remember what I had. ;)Why the one star rating? So after dinner we decide to checkout the lounge. We received some complimentary drink tickets due to a mishap with the check. Thank you for that buttttt...Upon arrival to the lounge I presented my drink ticket. I asked for my usual poison- jack and coke. The bartender did a good pour of the jack. Kuddos for that. However when I tried the drink it tasted horrible. Why you ask... The coke was flat. It tasted like when u forget the bottles of soda open and are just dying for a soda and get the unpleasant surprise that it has gone flat. I told the bartender about it and her reply was that my drink had a healthy portion of jack that's why I couldn't taste the coke. Nice I didn't agree. I am professional jack and coke drinker.... That was not it. But ok I sipped it again just to try to lie to myself that what she said was true. After two more sips I couldn't do it.i called her over again to complain it was flat. Her reply this time  was its good thing my drink was free!!! Really?!? That's how you speak to customers? And she walks away.  I was in utter shock and my friends and I just looked at each other in disbelief. After a few minutes of trying to regain my composure I asked to speak to the manager. After 5 minutes he appears. I explained the situation to him. I relayed the rude behavior and how I was really trying to make them aware the soda was flat. I told him to try my drink so he can see. He said he's not allowed to drink anything but would take my word for it. He goes over to speak to the female bartender and returns to offer me any other drink. But this time he tells a male bartender to make it for me. I felt like maybe he thought I had it in for the female girl rather than trying to make him aware of the flat soda. So I asked the manager if they had the same cocktail list like upstairs. His reply is no but to pick whatever I wanted. So I call the male bartender that had now been assigned to me. I asked him the same question. Do you make the misdemeanor from upstairs? His reply was absolutely. So he went off to make me one. Guess the manager is clueless about what cocktails are being served at the lounge. Isn't that basic 101 of being a manager? Know your product? So now my misdemeanor is served. I take a sip and it was the biggest mess of lime juice u could ever taste. It tasted nothing like the misdemeanor they served me upstairs during dinner. It was just disgusting. I sent it back. The manager just looked on at me sending it back and didn't say anything... He just walked away and just didn't want to be bothered at ensuring customer was satisfied. On a plus side the music was great -- R&b and hip hop. but since there is NO discipline (dress code, sucky drinks, clueless managers) in this place it will soon become a ghetto lounge.Four lessons from this vandal: 1. Train your staff to not be rude to customers 2. Your bar staff in the lounge suck, send them to bartending school!! 3. Your coke is flat in the lounge. Fix it. 4. Manager should know what's served in lounge if he's in charge of it. He was clueless. Get some class and have some sort of dress code. People were dressed like they were going to the beach or like truckers and not in a trendy classy place. Trucker hats is not dinner/ NYC nightlife wear. This place doesn't hold water to classy establishments such as TAO. I will stick to going there and avoid wannabes such as this place.",10,7,3,Carolina B.,"Washington, DC",292,193,7785

2.0,8/19/2016,"Beauty and Essex is behind a faux pawn shop, Vandal is behind a commercialized and tacky floral shop that used to be an elegant name in the West Village, so far not much of a departure. Then the best part and reason behind 2 stars - the vibe and artwork are a great distraction from what's on your plate. It's NYC, if you want great street food go out and find it because it's not here. Here things really fell flat and the menu is as disjointed, random and as conceptually confused as the sister restaurant Beauty and Essex. Since when is Greek salad a ""street food""? And if we could consider tuna tartar as such this one tasted like fabuloso (seriously, if you order it think of the cleaning product when you take a bite). Grilled avocado sounded interesting but then appeared lost in a mountain of slaw. I'm giving it 2 stars for decor (it's very cool what they've done with the space). To top it off the server over charged us. When asking her about it she said ""Oh I'm sorry, did I? I did the math in my head oops!"" definitely not the explanation I was looking for...

Great that $1.20 went to them, but not sure why the water cost more than $1.20 to begin with. My real problem is the fact that the food itself was fucking boring. The knish's didn't taste like anything, the jerk chicken tostones was shop rite chicken salad on a ritz cracker, and the sticky rice dumplings were just pork in a bun with soy sauce. We left hungry and broke. The waiter totally realized we saw through this bullshit and finally stopped giving us his spiel about how wonderful this place is.

The music was way too loud that you cannot concentrate on chewing. Expect to wait at least half an hour past your reservation time. They have some interesting concepts for the menu items, but some of the concepts just didnt work well together. The food is also way too salty, prob because they try to blend too many flavors. Maybe that's how they get you to buy more drinks.",1,1,0,Kyna C.,"New York, NY",32,121,24

The food is very, very good but not quite excellent; I would definitely recommend the vegetarian pizza. What did blow my mind though were the drinks ; they have some truly innovative and refreshing mixes that are definitely worth a try! This place is quite large, with three different seating areas, and you'll find a not too overly chic, not hipsterish, pretty crowd from various age ranges. Lots of corporate people as well.

4.0,8/7/2016,"Finally got to Vandal NYC last night and it was great. Everything about it just makes for such a fun night. It's a huge, cool space with awesome decor. Front rooms seem to be a little less noisy than the backroom. The menu is typical Chris Santos..you want to try everything. Our favorite was probably the Knish Reuben, it was just luscious. The jerk chicken tostones and fish tacos were great. Loved the crispy bao buns. Skirt steak was a safe choice - but they cooked it perfectly. Only miss was the NY pretzel steak tartare. Couldn't really distinguish the taste of the tartare from the doughy, salty pretzel. But what we really appreciated was the service, from the bartender who served us drinks before we sat, to the bouncers at the front and entrance to the lounge (they have a downstairs lounge that's a very cool space to have drinks) and of course our waiter. All were friendly, professional, helpful. Sometimes at a trendy place like this you find the service stand offish or distant; there was none of that.

And yes, our whole party was present.Now that I've explained my 3-stars, I can move on to the positives! Great spot for a birthday dinner amongst friends because everyone can order something so opposite, that we all wanted to taste each others dishes. Love that.

It is super cool you have to go through the back door of a flower shop to get into the restaurant. For a restaurant that gives you an experience like Vandal does, I was surprised the food lived up to the atmosphere. The menu is all tapas varying in size. The focus is street food from around the world. Certain dishes are definitely better than others. The bao buns are a must try and the pork chop special was incredible, however the ceviche was just meh. Don't miss out on dessert. The macaron ice cream sandwich and smores were excellent. The drinks are also memorable and delicious, they also have a great selection of mocktails and tea if you don't fancy drinking.The price tag is steep, but you are paying for an experience.

4.0,8/3/2016,"One word: A M A Z I N G!I went last night, on a Tuesday, and it sure was packed! I had a reservation for 10:30, got there a little before. The hostess were extremely nice and apologetic about any time we were waiting. They gave us a buzzer to let us know when our table was ready. We waited by the bar and the art work oh man, it was just breathtaking. I took my girlfriend out and she was pretty impressed with the venue choice (Score!) We ordered a Pacifico beer and before you know our table was ready 10 mins later (right on time!) Walking to our table was like walking through an art gallery. We were seated and our waiter TYLER was awesome! He gave us a breakdown of what the place was about and also his faves in the restaurant. We went with the Chilean Sea Bass tacos which were amazing (wish I would of gotten 2 orders of that), the NY pretzel steak Tartare was not the best but it is also because I didn't know what tartare was! (Ha) We also got the Balinese Branzino which is a white filet of fish, presented beautifully and it was DELICIOUS! We got the Cripsy Bao Buns which was also another good choice! The portions came in 3 for the tacos and the buns, and the white fish had 2 pieces of filet, the pretzel seemed like a mini pretzel but with a good amount of the tartare. After desert we were stuffed.  Tyler was a great waiter and I recommend asking for him if you can. He was funny and constantly checked on us to make sure we were doing great. The best part was desert. I was disappointed when they didn't have the Nutella Cannoli so we go the smores paired with the Irish coffee Jameson desert drink. I literally had no words when Tyler asked me ""how is everything"" I couldn't even speak with a big chunk of it in my mouth. If I could lick the plate I would of! Savage is right! For drinks my girlfriend had the Miss Demeanor which if your a fan of the Dominican Rum Brugal omg it's like a vacation in your drink! I got Las Palmitas which is a mezcal based drink with mint and spicy ending which leaves your body feeling buzzed and your mind appreciating the art even more! I also had the pushcart drink which to me tasted like spicy olive juice, it was okay but I should of went with las Palmitas again. The only downside is that it is pricey. I spent over 200 dollars but I am telling you it was totally worth the experience. It is not something I would do all the time because then I would be homeless but it was a great date. The ambiance was so chill. There were a lot of groups celebrating parties so this is definitely a celebration spot! The music they played was really good a mix of house, electro, hip hop r&b. I would of loved to go downstairs because it's a lounge but it was time to head home for us.

I came for a work event so we we were seated in the back room with the cool bookshelf wall. Because this was a work event with 20 people, we had a pre-chosen tasting menu which consisted of- Thai Papaya Summer roll: pass! If you've ever had thai before in your life you will not enjoy this version this- Scallop Mango Mojito Ceviche: pass, the mojito favor overpowers the scallop- Knish Reuben: my colleagues loved this but I didn't think it was anything special- Fish Tacos: my absolute fav!! Everything about it was just perfect! - Wild Mushroom Street Pizza: my other fav! So good I even ate all the crust! - Chicken and Egg Waffles: fried chicken served over Hong Kong waffles. The concept sounds great but the execution was horrible. The Hong Kong waffles were too doughy and din't have any crisp to it. The $1 street carts make much better waffles- Prime Skirt steak with fried rice: This was good but very standard dish - Lobster and Chicken Paella: The texture of the paella tasted more like fried rice than paella. Everyone ate the lobster and left the rest. I wish I got to try the Hot Pretzel Steak Tartare, I walked by a table with it and it looked amazing!

I ordered a Las Palmitas, which was a spiced Mezcal mixed with a grapefruit beer. Normally I'm not a fan of anything spicy, but this drink had a kick to it, in a good way. We finally got seated and were given a small free appetizer, it kind of resembled fried mac and cheese balls. We ordered the Crispy Bao Buns, a Wild Mushroom Street Pizza, and the Knish Reuben. My favorite out of the three were the Crispy Bao Buns, definitely a must. The food didn't really blow me away, especially for the price and portion size.

1.0,7/30/2016,"Wow this was my favorite place and go to restaurant to take out my guests who come to visit . However, after this last experience  that's forever changed! It's incredible how one bad night can truly change your view on a place. Let's start with The hostess and how rude they all were! We arrived an hour early to check in for our reservation. We asked if anything opened up to let us know and we can wait at the bar. The hostess said "" I doubt it and wait or leave"".. Umm that's pretty unpleasant. After that comment we went to the bar and luckily found a little corner spot. The bar waitress wasn't any better. The minute we sat down we were being rushed. We took one drink out of our wine glasses and she came back three min to tell us "" do you want  a second round.. we weren't even 1/4 done with the first. She kept coming by asking if we were going to leave for the table and finally my fiancé had to tell her that look we are enjoying our drinks and appetizers before our table. The appetizers weren't any better. The moment we were half way done the busser came by to swoop out plates before we could finish. My mother literally had to grab her oyster from The plate because he took it while she was eating. Now an hour later our time came to get the table and the hostess said it wasn't ready.. This is already 10:30. So we wait a little longer and get seated outside! We told her no outside and she said "" oh well I can't make tables turn and ""it is what it is"" take it or leave it"". .. To our shock we said okay let's take it. To be followed by the rudest server ever!! The menu has recently changed and a lot of our go to options have added some ingredients we can't eat due to religious Observants. When we asked if we could remove the bacon from the Blt pizza or the cheese from the burger the server said "" look this isn't my restaurant and no motivations"".. When we asked if you could ask the kitchen he literally said "" no order as is or don't""I mean Rude rude rude all night from every service aspect. I used to love this place because of the ambiance, music, and menu. Now after this experience I don't think I'll be returning.

The rudest service I had In a long time from the hostesses, cocktail waitress and the waiter. All made the experience very unpleasant. We came in early with the hope to be seated before our reservation and were told the only place we can be seated at the time is outside. We decided to wait for our reservation and sat near the bar. We ordered couple of appetizers and drinks and before we could grab the last bite the server already grabbed the plates and asked if we wanted to order something else. I mean.... At least they could have let us enjoy the last couple of bites... When the time for our reservation was up (an hour later) our table wasn't ready and to our surprise guess where the hostess wanted to seat us? Outside! When I expressed my dissatisfaction I was answered with rude attitude and the notion that ""it is what it is"" if you want to wait longer you can.Then when we sat down OUTSIDE and asked to change couple of items to suite our allergies and religious observation such as taking out the pork from the pizza we were told and i quote ""this is not my restaurant I can't make any changes"" I asked if you could ask the kitchen and he refused to ask.Overall I wouldn't come back.

Perfection! GET THIS!Tuna Crudo -- Every tuna tartare lover's favorite. It was a tuna poke mixed with a delicious combination of flavors that just melts in your mouth. Loved it!Blackened Shrimp Arepas -- Not only did it have a good presentation but also the fish was cooked perfectly and the cream in the bottom blends in all the flavors so well. Recommend it!Grilled Avocado -- We didn't want a heavy carby medium dish so we went for this. It's a papaya salad meets avocado with a bunch of other flavors. Nothing too impressive but filled with lots of flavors! Drinks -- If you like Mezcal and want something strong..go for Las Palmitas!

Let's just say, the place was HOPPIN. Not my typical scene. Lots of girls in tight dresses and guys dressed to impress, but it sure looked like everyone was having a grand ole time. It was quite crowded, so you really had to squeeze your way through the crowds. I could definitely see coming back for a birthday party or celebration.

It wasn't dry and the collards were amazing, but it was just decent. I rather eat the collards than anything else.Steak Tartare - presentation is fun, but flavouring lacked, this was the blandest steak tartare I ever had.

5.0,7/17/2016,Really good music and vibes. I had the crispy Bao buns which were amazing the brisket was very tender. I also had the double Dutch and if you like sweet drinks I'd recommend trying it. I absolutely love this place!,1,1,1,Amber C.,"Manhattan, NY",33,74,12

3.0,7/14/2016,"From graffiti on the walls to ear drum bursting 90s rap music to the giant pink bunny frozen in a b-boy move, Vandal appropriates hip hop culture in the gaudiest ways possible.Foods:- side of grilled corn: similar to Mexican elote, just off the cob. Delicious! - shawarma salad: no twist on what you would expect from a Mediterranean joint, except for the $15 price.- crispy bao buns: tender brisket, crunchy slaw, lots of flavor. My favorite dish of the evening. - we were too full to take more than one bite of lobster & chicken paella, but that one bite said it all -- no thank you! Food undeniably takes a back seat to Vandal's fun, trendy atmosphere, but at least your social media feed will look incredible.",5,2,4,Fancypants X.,"San Francisco, CA",188,2067,3312
5.0,7/11/2016,"My sister lives in NYC and had been wanting to try Vandal since it opened. We had the perfect opportunity to try the restaurant when some of our cousins visited from India. I think that Vandal was one of the best restaurant experiences I have had in a long time. The decor and service was fantastic, and everything on the menu was unique and delicious. I love that we enetered the restaurant through the flower shop, and I loved walking around the different rooms of the restaurant. I would definitely recommend making a reservation, becaus the large restaurant is very busy. We started out our meal with cocktails and I ordered the Lost and Found, a gin based drink, which was perfectly balanced. I kept meaning to try something else, but liked this drink so much that I just drank the same cocktail all night. The menu is tapas style, which is great if you are with people you are comfortable with and have no dietary restrictions. We started out with the steak tartare pretzels and the crispy bao buns. I actually think these were my two favorite things I had that night. The banh mi sliders were also very flavorful, and I also enjoyed the salmon and the chicken katsu. We were stuffed after all our food, but still ordered the greek donuts for dessert. Overall, it was a perfect evening. I definitely recommend walking around the restaurant, since the design is beautiful. We were very lucky, because we were able to sit in the area that was semi outdoors, and they have plenty of large round tables, which were perfect for conversation.",3,0,0,Saacha M.,"Boston, MA",88,178,23
4.0,7/11/2016,"8.5/10 stars The decor at Vandal is indeed unique and I quite like all the artwork. My boyfriend and I sat in the outdoor area on a warm day but it was cool under the roof. I like the variety of the menu and given the tapas style, the ability to try many dishes. My boyfriend and I split the mini Reuben strudels, pastrami buns, rice cakes, octopus, and the lamb Kati rolls. I particularly enjoyed the lamb, which was very tender and came with several delicious sauces. The rest of the tapas were unique and tasty but I wouldn't call them outstanding. For dessert we had the spiked Thai iced tea and Nutella cannolis. The Thai iced tea was quite delicious and had perfect boba inside. The cannolis were excellent as well. The espresso was very good too.",0,0,0,Alice C.,"Brooklyn, NY",6,29,76
1.0,7/10/2016,"Had the most awful experience.  Came for a birthday dinner for my husband and waited close to an hour past our reservation time at 10:15!  Service was mediocre, drinks unmemorable and food was absolutely awful - everything was oversalted and the crowd of scantily dressed women did not make for an enjoyable dining experience.  At the end of the dinner, my bag was not hanging on my chair,  but it was thrown across the floor halfway across the table.  My credit card and cash were stolen from my bag.  This does not make for an upscale/trendy dining venue or a birthday celebration.  Have dined at TAO for years and never had such an experience.  Worst birthday celebration ever.  THERE ARE SO MANY DINING VENUES IN NEW YORK, SKIP THIS ONE.",1,0,0,Alla I.,"Brooklyn, NY",82,8,0
1.0,7/10/2016,"Went to this establishment last night for a friend's birthday. All was good until I got into the line for the lounge. I was promptly asked if there was a name on a list. I gave a name, and I was told that person doesn't exist. Ok fine. I reach out to the people that are in the party and they say that there is not a list, just an ID check. Ok. Cool. It's funny because the people in front of me did not need to provide a name nor did those behind me. I am now standing on the side of this line, seeing everyone else get in even some others that were apart of my friends party that I know did not buy a table or provided a name. Ahh ok, I see the issue, I wasn't allowed in simply because of my size. This took place for 20 minutes until I was ""allowed"" to go downstairs, like I was some saved special fat girl that was awarded a privilege.Upon entry, I was then told that because I didn't have a stamp that I would not be allowed re-entry should I leave. WOW now your doing me a favor. BLESS YOUR HEART! I then arrive to a mediocre basement party where the dj was subpar, people wearing flip flops and t-shirts and the not to mention that people were standing at the bar with their ""bottle service"", that was a first. Long story short, that is absolutely no way to treat a customer by embarrassing them in front of other  patrons to warrant exclusivity. I've been to plenty of higher end lounges and clubs with the same body and this has never happened to me. Shame on you Vandal, too bad I would have loved to enjoy myself and spend tons of money on drinks but now I have a putrid taste left behind in my mouth for you.",2,0,0,sarah y.,"NY, NY",2,9,0
4.0,7/9/2016,Heard a lot about vandal from the media and friends. Went for a couple of drinks with my wife. We had a good time. Except the fact that the bartender looked me up and down because I was wearing shorts when I walked in. I didn't appreciate that especially since it was 5 pm. I would have understood if it was at night for dinner. But anyways the drinks were decent and we got the bau and the shrimp arepas. Bau was really good. Shrimp was ok. I would come back again but only for an occasion as this place is pricey for no reason other it's the hit spot in town right now.,1,0,0,Hassan P.,"New York, NY",467,134,149
2.0,7/9/2016,"The ambience and music were fantastic. However, that is where the positive review ends. The customer service was horrendous! Our waitress forgot an appetizer order, and when asked if the order was placed responded with, ""I don't know"". At that point the entrees were being served and the appetizer order was canceled. Not once did our waitress ask how our meals were, and we had to chase her down for any new drink orders etc. At the end of our dinner, we waited at least 15-20 minutes for our waitress to walk by and bring our table the bill. If I didn't stand up from our table to track her down, who knows how much longer we would've been waiting. I will most likely never visit this establishment again, as the food was only mediocre for the price and service provided.",2,1,1,Michell S.,"Richmond, VA",4,8,2
4.0,7/9/2016,"BRUNCH REVIEW (AMBIANCE 5 // FOOD 3) : Vandal has been on my radar ever since I walked by and saw a huge mural of Fairey's work in the outdoor seating area. Good art and good food?? Could it possibly get any better?? And it did. They offered Brunch. So the ambiance of this place, even during a sparse brunch (patio was fullish, we were seated inside) , is very warm and cozy. Our waiter informed us that at night, the restaurant is truly ""popping"", complete with a dj and club feel. Brunch was definitely a lot more subdued! The space inside is huge and just covered with amazing street art. I was glad I stopped by during a less busy time so I could look at all the art in the space. Now food... me being a huge fan of the food network, was super excited to try Chris Santos' food. The portions are smaller than normal brunches (given the tapas style), and you are definitely paying a bit more for less. However, my friend and I split the coffee pancakes, red bean french toast and fries. I was a huge fan of the french toast (has red bean inside) but it definitely tasted more like a dessert than french toast. The coffee pancakes were very good as well but the only coffee flavor came from the beans that were crushed into the batter of the pancakes. It was a it odd as I first mistook the grounds as egg shells but was able to distinguish the difference due to the coffee flavor. The fries were good but simpler than I expected -- they just were powdered with a spice mix and the aioli/housemade ketchup were lacking in the spices and did not woo me in any way. Our service was great! My friend was 20 minutes late and the hostess still held the table for us . This may have been because brunch was not really that busy. Our waiter was a riot and extremely amiable -- he also made sure to stop by and check in on us in around 30 minute intervals. So in all, ambiance/decor is a 5 star but the brunch foods we ordered were a 3 star (4 star for french toast, 3.5 for the coffee pancakes, 2.5 for fries). I wish the plates were a bit larger and the flavors a bit bolder. I am enticed to come during dinner/late drink time and experience the lounge aspect of the restaurant.",1,0,0,Shivi S.,"Boston, MA",40,139,73

4.0,7/8/2016,"A complete scene and a half with surprisingly good food.Bar area is crazy crowded and it is a completely glamorous and trendy crowd. We managed to get drinks and waited with our Cheesecake Factory like buzzers for our table (even tho we had a reservation).  After 30 minutes or so, my hand vibrated and we were taken through a mammoth sized resto to our table. Very cool decor, music and yes the atmosphere, while loud and trendy and young, was really quite enjoyable.Service was lovely (but I should mention the hostess was not). Our waitress was super friendly and helpful.  While you can tell they wanted to turn the table over, she knew we were enjoying ourselves and didn't really rush us.Stand outs on the menu were brisket-like sliders, red snapper tostadas, crunchy eggplant. Blueberry macaron dessert was heavenly. Decent wine list, not the greatest, but you can certainly find something and at a price that won't bankrupt you.While a resto like this isn't typically my thing, I was pleasantly surprised at the food and how much I ended up enjoying it.  Fun night out!",1,0,1,Stacey F.,"Tampa, FL",13,129,5
4.0,7/8/2016,"Upon hearing so much about Vandal i decided to give it a shot.To start with the atmosphere is amazing!!I had reservations and got sat promptly with no wait time. The waitress was rude and unfortunately i did not get her name but i can easily say she had the biggest ""my life sucks"" attitude and was ruining my experience. Aside from that we decided to start ordering. We got the mini burgers which were AMAZING... oh my goodness.. It was a bit pricy for the size.. since it was $9 for what was basically a slider but it was definitely worth it. The margarita pizza was also amazing!!!! We got skirt steak as our meal and that was amazing as well!When it came time for dessert the waitress (with the terrible attitude) kept recommending the s'mores bar saying it was AMAZING... it was definitely NOT amazing and i definitely do NOT recommend it.

5.0,7/7/2016,"LES is one of those areas that you would be able to find not only decent restaurants, but also cool bars, and Vandal is definitely one of those combinations. My college friend was visiting from the west coast so I would have to make sure to come up with something smart.We went with recommendations and shared two signature small plates. As a fish lover, I enjoyed our tuna tartare a lot. But if you are a big meat lover, should absolutely go with the pretzel with steak tartare; as the pretzel was surprisingly chewy and tartare well-marinated. For the big plate, we opted for the steak rice with sausage - remember to ask your steak to be cooked medium rare and thank me later! Girls love dessert so we shared the matcha lemon semifreddo with blueberry on the side - perfect way to end our dinner!Hmm I might have made a mistake here as Vandal was actually quite noisy and we would have to shout to each other in order to make conversation. But my friend told me this was one of the best meals that she has enjoyed in NYC. Now I'm so proud of myself! Will be back for more tapas, and most importantly, the macaron sandwich!",17,10,14,Elaine H.,"San Francisco, CA",1221,1748,5633

We were a party of four and ordered the blackened shrimp arepas, spicy scallops, fish tacos and bao buns as appetizers. For entrees I got the skirt steak - BOMB!!! amazing. Could have easily been shared by two people, however I did eat it all and was so happy.

While the concept of ""street food"" to share worked well for both the group dinner and date I had at Vandal, the portions are very small and some items are not as well executed as others. Service: Waitress was great, but hostess was borderline rude as we tried to schedule a follow-up reservation.

4.0,7/6/2016,"I came here on a first date. I arrived around 8pm, my date hadn't arrived yet so I sat at the bar which has this cute little sitting area. You're in very close proximity to the table next to you, but I didn't mind it much. The place has amazing ambiance, a nice attractive young crowd and it was lit!While I waited I ordered a drink. It was a cocktail made with HENNESSY. My eyes lit up when I saw that. I've never seen a henny cocktail on a menu in my life. And it was delicious! When my date arrived, we had to wait 30 more minutes or so to be seated because apparently Vandal is a hot spot and he had no reservation.When we were seated, I ordered another one of those henny cocktails, fries, these Korean BBQ sliders and the grilled avocado. Now I'm a foodie and I can honestly say the food was alright. He ordered salmon and I tasted it, it tasted fishy (I've had salmon in Malibu that had no fishy seafood taste whatsoever and that set the bar for me). But that grilled avocado is TO DIE FOR. I love all avocado dishes but this one in particular was made with love. I'll be back, specifically for the henny cocktail and the grilled avocado. I heard the place turns in to a night club. I didn't stay for that but I'm sure it's lit too. Vandal is good in my book.",4,2,3,Janée J.,"Manhattan, NY",35,53,8

I also really liked the chicken katsu (very well seasoned and perfectly textured), fried eggplant and the brussel sprouts. However, the patatas bravas were a huge disappointment -- came in super big cubes drizzled with only a small amount of bland sauce, resulting in a double win for EXTREME blandness.

They brought us those two...plus an uber-rich dark chocolate cupcake with purple ganache frosting with a candle! So sweet of them to help us celebrate.

Left, you'll find yourself at the bar, right, you'll see the huge amazing dining area. As I said, this is a very hip establishment. You'll be surrounded by beautiful people, loud conversations, and good music. The art all around is truly incredible. You need to walk around to truly appreciate the work. Vandal is very spacious, from the front you would not expect it at all! But the layout is made in a way that at some point you would walk around to see the art. Example of this would be placing the bathrooms at the back so no matter where you're eating, you'll have to see the art on the way back.The cocktails are spot on strong, great choices leaning on the more expensive side, but not outrageous.

They're a mix of crunchy, sweet and savory. Pizzas. I've now had the pesto & mushroom. They're both great but the mushroom is hard to top. The NY pretzel beef tar tar. Seriously- wow. I've never eaten anything like this anywhere. Crispy eggplant. I literally don't know what magical soy sauce they sprinkle on the eggplant, but it's so good and almost tastes like a potato?

They even customize the menu so that everyone in your group can have a taste. Highly recommend this place if you have a chance. One issue I have is their service.

4.0,6/15/2016,"This is a cool joint. It does not look like much from the street, but it is large inside. There are several different seating areas inside. The decor is eclectic to say the least. There is also a lot of cool artwork through out.We came in for brunch. I started with the New York Hot Pretzel Steak Tartare. The pretzel comes topped with American Kobe beef tartare, smoked aioli and mustard. Few places offer tartare, so I am always excited when I get to enjoy it. Their unique spin on it made it even better. It was not the best tartare I have ever experienced, but I enjoyed it none the less.Next up was the  Footlong NYC Street Dog. It is a Meat Hook Butcher Shop dog topped with bacon jam and cheese sauce. What more could one ask for? This was very good. The flavors were on point. I enjoyed every bite.I did not order, but I was able to taste a few other items at the table. The Prime Skirt Steak Fried Rice was tasty. I would certainly order it for myself in the future. The Crispy Bao Buns were also pretty good.This is a cool place with interesting menus and decor.

3.0,6/15/2016,"Not sure where people ate previously to say that this over salted and sub par food is to die for. The place is simply hyped up, yes they have an amazing decor with beautiful art pieces and yes their drinks are superb. Aside from that every small/medium dish we tried was overpriced for the quality received. Trader Joes corn is hands down better then theirs. Brisket was way over-salted. For NY, the mushroom pizza was simply unacceptable, I am not comparing it to some of the most established pizza joints out there but their dry slice vs. dollar slices in the city on a late night drunk night cant compare. Suprisingly the oysters were great, never had guac served on the side and found that interesting. Service was good though both in bar and @ table side. So if you want to take cool pics of cool graffiti while sipping on some great drinks then sure otherwise skip the hype and go get food @ 100 other establishments that really make your taste buds scream.",0,0,0,Sam S.,"Brooklyn, NY",12,35,2
2.0,6/15/2016,"Eating At the Vandal was so loud, hip, and trendy that I wasn't sure if I was having dinner, or clubbing. I couldn't tell if I was supposed to sip my cocktail, or accidentally spill it on a stranger's dress. You're reminded of this repeatedly as you carry shouting conversations with your friends, are surrounded by people who are dressed much better than you, and again when you get your ridiculous bill. Vandal tries SO hard, right down the waiters' description of food. It was the first time I've ever heard a waiter's recommendation start with, ""This steak is the most popular steak on Instagram right now."" YEAH DUDE, BUT HOW DOES IT TASTE?!  Nothing bothers me as much as when people try to exploit Asian flavors and then charge an obscene price for a bite. The banh mi sliders, Hong Kong egg waffle, bao buns, and sticky rice dumplings were all extremely mediocre. The only highlights being the heaven burgers and the wild mushroom pizza. The rest? Dishes that are really trying to be something, but falling quite short. The cocktails are decent--if not incredibly strong.Unfortunately for me, Vandal was all talk, and not enough bite.",9,7,2,Josephine Z.,"Queens, NY",787,445,182

We had to wait about 45 minutes for a table despite having a reservation (a very late reservation at that). We stood in the lobby with about 100 of our closest, well dressed super hip friends ::eye roll:: While we were there, we spotted a roach crawling out of the bricks in the lobby, gross... but, this is NYC. We told the hostess about it, who told the manager (good looking, great beard) and we got a round of drinks and shots for free. Service was impeccable. Atmosphere: Super swank, lots of beautiful people, amazing artwork, good music selection. We were seated, tucked away in a little corner... it was awesome. Food/Drinks: Some hits and misses, but the hits were super hits. The wild mushroom pizza ::HOMER DROOL:: So good! Sea bass tacos were good as well as was the skirt steak.

Our waiter was excellent. He was well informed, happy to make recommendations, and followed up frequently to make sure everything was swell. Equally impressive was that dirty plates were always quickly removed, water was frequently replenished, and wine poured at a pace that didn't require an additional bottle unless you really wanted it. The ambiance at Vandal is so fun. The artwork, the entrance through the floral shop, the open air bar area, the music, the lighting... it really made for a fun atmosphere. As the evening progressed, it did get a bit noisy and more difficult to hear our table's conversations, but it wasn't deafening as some places can be.The small plates are creative and some are simply outstanding. I highly recommend the grilled avocado, the knish reuben, the octopus (OMG... so good), the crispy bao buns, and the salmon and branzino large plates.Get a reservation, bring your friends, drink the moderately priced mostly Spanish wine list, and enjoy a 3-hour dining experience!",1,0,0,Don S.,"New York, NY",56,43,0

Their walls are covered in art, both street and chic, they have random but beautiful paintings scattered around the restaurant and even have an expresso cart dead smack in the center of the restaurant. If you're looking to check out their downstairs lounge you will need to get passed two, huge bouncers and a posh looking hostess who will check you out from head to toe before granting you access. If you tell them you are there for a dinner reservation later in the night, they usually let you in. The lounge itself is actually worth the trouble, the dj set is pretty cool and the atmosphere is fun.

The only time they had left for dinner was 9:45pm which sounded late but turned out being okay. We showed up right on time and were told it would be about 15-20 minutes for our table so we headed over to the bar to buy a drink while we waited. The staff was all very friendly and a manager came over and offered to seat us in the basement for dinner so that we wouldn't have to wait and then we would be prime for when the party started. We had tacos and tostadas which were good but all very small - tini-tiny tostadas. When the club did start to fill up there were a number of bottle service spots and really no where for dancing. The bar area got a bit crowded but no where near packed. I was expecting something a bit more lively for a Thursday night. The drinks are expensive for a club like atmosphere. $15 for a simple vodka soda adds up quickly. We stayed until about 2am then headed over to bOb Bar to actually get our dance on.

Our server was a beautiful Eastern European woman that looked like she just stepped off the runway. To say we got treated bad would be an understatement. We were seated at counter and they asked ME to hold a credit card before our drinks...like we were going to run out. I asked the guys on my left and right if they were required to give card. They both said no. It was clear as day what it was. There was a passive aggressive back and forth between the waitress and I because I kept calling her on BS even though she smiled and was pleasant while she gave us bad service. Here was the dilemma. She treated us bad because she felt that WE don't tip. I was tempted not to give her a tip, but then I would be affirming her belief. If I did tip her, I'm a sucka for rewarding someone who clearly didn't want to serve ""my kind"". Of course you know Mel MADE me give her a tip. Oh yeah, our party tried to go into lounge area at 8pm and they required US to give a credit card and commit to $1500 bottle spend. As I attempted to negotiate entry for US, I watched the velvet ropes part about a dozen times letting different groups that didn't look like US in without credit cards. It was a dear friends birthday so I didn't walk out, make a scene or get upset. But I am aware and will never return.The decor is phenomenal and the food is tasty but very small portioned.

My favs were an eggplant dish and the cheeseburger sliders, that just hit it.The bar makes some very creative drinks and the physical space is beautiful. The staff is once again much like ""The Boss"" CCC. My only gripe with Vandal was it was loud.

We went early since it was somewhat of a last minute thing (and that's the only res we could get), so the place wasn't that crowded. However, during our meal the place filled up and became more lively. Everything was shared amongst the group. I recommend the Bao Buns and Chilean Sea Bass Tacos. The Steak Tartare Pretzel was also much better than expected. I'd skip the Heaven Spot Mini Burger and go with the Banh Mi'eatball Slider if deciding between the two. The burger was juicy, but the flavor was missing ""something"" and disappointed. Greek Donuts are a must for dessert....obviously. Host was nice and pleasant, and the waiter was as well.

Really disappointed with Vandal.  I had higher expectations but was really put down by the quality of the food.  Ambience and service was great but the food was a flop. Out of everything we ordered the only two things I liked that was passable was the steak tartare with pretzel and the pizza (but Two Brothers pizza would satisfy anyone's street food craving for $1).  It was a lot smaller than I expected but was favorite out of all the other dishes we had.  The skirt steak was too sweet (the rice was decent), shrimp was boring, buns were mediocre/forgettable,  grilled avocado with pickled vegs was nothing special (read hipster bull****).  We ordered other plates but they were so boring that I don't remember.  The spicy mezcal cocktail was the most flavorful thing I had. I also enjoyed looking at the beautiful flowers at the entrance. This is definitely a pass and don't listen to the hype.  If your a tourist and want street food, stick to all the awesome street food trucks NY has to offer.  For a party of 7 we spent $2000 between dinner and a few bottles in the bar downstairs.  I think everyone should at least go home with some artwork with the prices here.  Save your money and go elsewhere.",3,0,0,Farrah B.,"Queens, NY",615,31,8

Sometimes shared small plates can be tough with allergies, but they were communicative and attentive! Plus the waiter pointed out that the fries are fried in the same oil as gluteny fried foods so that's always a sign that they actually understand the allergy and take it seriously!We went a bit crazy with the ordering - eyes were bigger than our stomachs - some of the highlights though we're the grilled avocado salad, the grilled corn side dish, summer roll and jicama tostadas. Plus they brought out one slider without a bun and it was one of the best little burgers I've ever had!It was pretty quiet when we got there at 6:15 on a Thursday but the volume and crowd definitely picked up as the night went on. Seems like the type of trendy scene-y place that is as much about the clientele and atmosphere as it is about the food - luckily the food and drinks did stack up.

Gorgeous art everywhere, super high ceilings, great attention to detail. The vibe is a little dressy-slutty. Essentially people were dressed like it was a nightclub (which it kind of is). The first floor is the dining room/bar. I can't comment too much on the food because I only tried a couple types of pizza and the steak tartare. Everything I put in my mouth was excellent tho. Then as you go downstairs you can find the lounge which is a more clubby feel. I think this is a great place to go out with your friends for a special night or for a date. They have a cute lil video booth which was fun- everyone was taking turns making gifs on this thing and sending them via email. The drinks were well made too. Only complaint was our server was really dropping the ball.

3.0,5/28/2016,"Ok, so yes this is suppose to be the must go new hip place in NY. I decided to go with my significant other last night 5/27. Lets just say the drinks are extremely over priced. We are definitely paying for the money spent in decorating that place. 16$ for a stoli and cranberry . 15 for a jameson and gingerale! When did Jameson become cheaper than stoli. Anyhoo...we got there earlier than our reservation and was still seated early so i will give a star for that...we decided to just order small plates and medium plates since my bf and I were limited in choices due to the ingredients. The next 2 stars truly are given because of the red snapper tacos...when I say amazing AMAZING! The next star I give is because of those delicious mini burgers. The best mini burger I EVER HAD!

5.0,5/25/2016,"Oh. My. God. I love this place so much. We came here for my cousin's 21st birthday, and what an amazing evening it was. However, like all restaurants, there were both pros and cons.PROS: - The entrance to this place is a bit obscure but also very interesting - a giant pink breakdancing bunny awaits you in the main lobby, which was a big attraction for everyone waiting for a table. Past the bunny in a separate room is a bar serving the most delicious drinks. I had the Double Dutch and my sister had the Pushcart Wars, and we were both more than satisfied! The drinks were both pretty and refreshing.- Another attraction is right past the bar, but before the entrance to the club downstairs. A public photobooth had everyone excited to show off their evening at SoHo's newest hot spot. - Vandal has incredible artwork covering every inch of the venue. All of the decor is unique and beautiful. - After we were seated, we were served by the friendliest, most helpful waitor I've ever had. He was cracking jokes and making recommendations all at once without ever being overwhelming. The food he suggested was incredible. We got red snapper tostadas, chilean sea bass tacos, and wild mushroom pizza. All were amazing, and we couldn't get over how delicious everything was.CONS:- The wait time for our table. We had a reservation for weeks and we spent more time at the bar waiting than we did eating! The reservation was for 11:00 PM and I believe we got a table at 1:00 AM. A bit absurd, but there was a lot to keep us distracted and make us comfortable while we waited.- The downstairs club was quite small, but fun nonetheless. Most people went there after eating upstairs, as did we.- The wait time for our drinks was also pretty long. I don't blame the bartender, however - there were around fifty people crowding the bar at once, and only two bartenders working. My only suggestion would be hiring more people to work behind the bar. This wasn't a big deal, though, as we only went two weeks after opening night.Overall our experience was fun and unlike anything we'd done before.

3.0,5/23/2016,"Had a bday brunch on a Sunday for a good friend. Several pros & cons to mention.. Let's start with the cons - service was not good. The girl was nice but the restaurant was not even busy and things took waaaay too long. We ordered fries for the table and they were cold. They never came back, and if they were going to, we were almost done so so we just canceled them. I ordered pizza& asked for garlic on the side, by the time I called someone else over to inquire, I was practically done, so again, I said 'forget it'. The music was completely off vibe. For a trendy downtown brunch, they should be playing some lounge, house type music with a UK vibe, even Afro-house. They were playing Smokey Robinson & Michael Jackson, whom I love, but wrong crowd. That's cool for like uptown, older people? Older money- my friends even said 'the music sucks'. Ok, the pros. Venue is awesome, fairly easy street parking, amazing flower shop when you walk in, food was good, nice bathroom which is great for selfies btw, and a cool video both for creating some cute memories.

1.0,5/20/2016,"Disappointing Service.  Changed my credit card receipt!!! This place looks really great.  Everywhere you look there's an interesting feature (wall art, giant bunny, graffiti etc) I went for brunch and thought the food was OK.  Nothing spectacular but interesting menu.  We had an issue that ruined the experience: the waiter gave us the check for a different table.  He didn't tell us until after we had signed and put in a tip. He said no problem, he'd fix it.  We waited and he came back with new receipts for us to sign.  He said he had ""transfer our receipts to the new check.  We said no problem, but could we get the copy saying they voided the receipts we signed.  He went to get his manager.  The manager told us they don't void things but that we just need to sign the new receipts.  We said, OK, then how do we know we won't be charge twice.  Manager says ""trust me, we won't"" . We said, OK, can we get the receipts we signed.  Manager says ""sorry we through them on the garbage.  But don't worry, we won't charge you twice"" This went on for an eternity.  It ruined our brunch completely.  We finally gave up on getting any paper proof that we could use with our credit card company in the event both charges went through. So we signed.  We had barely finished signing when our original waiter came around and just about yanked the signed receipts.  We were shocked, considering: we never said we wouldn't pay, we didn't even ask for anything after THEY were the ones who made the mistake, and we wanted something reasonable that I could get even at a Bodega - avoided transaction receipt. It's sad because I had planned to return.UPDATE: Lowered to 1 Star.  My credit card company just flagged this transaction because they changed my receipt.  They took the first receipt I signed (that they said was thrown in the garbage) and added a huge tip to make up the difference.  Though I gave a smaller tip in the first receipt and no tip in the second.  WHAT KIND OF BUSINESS CHANGES THE SIGNED CREDIT CARD RECEIPTS?

1.0,5/19/2016,"Had a great time because we made it that way, but one star for the absolutely dismal, rude service from ONE hostess/bar waitress.  Not sure her name because she didn't introduce herself, but she wore all black button up corset type 90's outfit and had mid-long hair - working/commanding the area from 7 pm - 9 pm on Thurs, May 19.  From the second our large party moved to a bar table she was the rudest, most entitled and abrasive person I have ever encountered (and I work in PR and service, as does my entire group for clients beyond her sphere of intelligence - we aren't divas, we are realists and treat our clients with respect and am mind boggled at those who don't act the same).  She spoke with us in the most disrespectful manner simply because we were such a large group and migrated from the bar to an open table in the bar area. I'm sorry, but where do you suggest we stand?  Where do you suggest we put the tacos, flatbread, dips  we ordered that adds to your collective gratuity?  On our heads with a drink in each hand? Oh, but rules were RULES, according to you.  She second guessed us, spit her opinions like venom and generally made us beyond uncomfortable and unwelcome.  Physically bumped into us every time she walked by.  Insistent that we couldn't sit without ordering through her, and then backtracked that we ultimately had to order through the bar in the most condescending, childish manner I've ever seen. We spent hundreds, if not thousands, and the sense of entitlement and air about her was APPALLING.   Whether that was a bar purchase or table service, Chris Santos, TAO: do you really consider the difference? I was with the owner of a PR firm, head of PR for top brands, as well as high level executives in the industry that have incredible WOM influence.  Awful, rude, rude, rude.  Nix this place because of this ONE person alone, or generally if upper management condones the behavior.  Really nice bartenders were awesome and actually made fun of this crazy person with us.  Wish I could quote her name, but hopefully it's clear to management and staff to try to figure out.

1.0,5/14/2016,Today there was the Jagermeister Launches Haus 56 Event at Vandal from 4-7pm. At least 50 people on line at 4 pm. Everyone was waiting patiently on line for this event. PR for this event comes by the line and told everyone that 90% of the people on line would not be able to get in. That media is first to go in before everyone else on line. Nothing on the event page said that regular people who RSVP for this event would not be able to attend or media would be first to go in. What is the point of making a event when people who RSVP can't even go in. Waited 1 hour on line and still nobody was able to go in. I see at least 150 media people going in. The PR guy for this event said the room downstairs is very small and would not fit much people. So why is there still so much media people going in. I really want to check out Vandal and enjoy a nice drink and some food. I'm frustrated how the PR organized this event and made everyone wait so long on line and not able to go in. Time is money. This PR guy really ruined the imagine for Vandal. Didn't get his name but believe me people were all frustrated with him. He did a terrible job planning this event. At least put a asterisk saying media are first to attend then people who RSVP gets to go next. What a waste of 1 hour standing on line on a beautiful Saturday.

So my father, his girlfriend, and I went to Vandal for dinner one night while on vacation in NYC. First, my dad's girlfriend asked what some favorites are on the menu. The waiter replied something along the lines of, ""there is someone in the world that likes each thing on the menu."" It was rude, but she laughed and asked again. He began to list every SINGLE item on the menu sarcastically. My dad's gf rolled her eyes and put in an order.After eating, the check came. We left a slightly low tip because of the rude service. We can't remember exactly what happened next, but somehow, we didn't get the credit card back. We searched everywhere and the staff kept saying they don't have it, but we knew it was in the restaurant. The manager, Mike, said he would call us that night when they close and let us know, so we left.The next day, none of us had received a call from Mike. I called and left a voicemail, which he never responded to. A few days later I called again and the restaurant took down my info and said they would pass it along. Again, nothing. I called maybe 5 times over the past month. Never heard back. Finally I got through today, and they still didn't have the card. Even worse, Mike didn't even remember our conversation.

When the waitress finally came back around I told her that my dish never came out. She looks at me and says Oh this was yours too while pointing to my friends empty plate. What?! So she had plated my dish with my friends dish and failed to tell me that. So my friend ate them all thinking it was just hers. QUESTION: 1. Why would my dish be combined with someone else's and 2. if it was- fine BUT how about you tell us that?!

Too many options! Good- shrimp arepas, tuna crudo & the Greek donuts dessert; average- Paella and baos & bad- civeche.

1.0,5/8/2016,"This place is a mess. I went to the club downstairs a couple weeks ago on a Saturday around 12:30/1 AM, and it was essentially totally empty. There were 4 of us, and we just walked in off the sidewalk, no problem at all. The DJ was awesome, and the space is really cool, but again, it was empty. Not exactly the ""scene"" it wishes it was. Perfect for me and my girlfriends to dance, though, and that's all we wanted. So naturally, when we went back last night to go to the club, I expected more of the same -- lots of space, awesome DJ, etc. We went and tried to get in around 11:30 PM, and everything was totally different. First of all, you had to go through the restaurant to get to the ""club"" (if you can really call it that), which was really complicated and annoying. Then, when we got to the ""club"" entrance, there was some acid-faced wrinkleho who, quite frankly, I couldn't tell if she was a human or a burnt potato chip, she was so crispy tanned-looking. We were in a group, so we told her we would be happy to get a table, but she gave us an exorbitant minimum. She would not negotiate AT ALL. And she was super #rude about it, saying, ""We don't NEED to negotiate. This is VANDAL."" I get it Mrs. Potato Head, we're in NYC, you think you're fancyAF because you're the guard dog at this ""club,"" but seriously, saying stuff like that is really ridiculous. It would be much better for Vandal's brand if you were gracious about it, instead of a classless...well, I'll just leave it at that. It would also probably be better for Vandal's brand if they had someone less repulsive at the door, but that's a different issue, I suppose. Anyway, I will obviously probably go back here at some point (late night) for dancing, but I won't have any expectations since, as I said earlier, this place is a disaster.",0,1,0,Laura S.,"New York, NY",0,16,0

Proceed through the door and you are transported into a supercool world. The first thing you'll see is a giant pink bunny. The music's great, the place is huge with a few different unique rooms. We had an amazing waitress named Ashley who guided us through the menu and made great suggestions. Thanks to her we didn't over order and enjoyed every bite. We had the Bao Buns, the Chilean Sea Bass Tacos, the Sticky Rice Balls, the Salsa Verde Pizza the knishes and to finish off the smores pie.

Let's start by how beautiful this space is. From the fake florist entrance filled with the brightest flowers set to a black background, to the entire layout and design of the dining space.  A feast for the eyes. The cocktails were awesome! We almost went for a third round but then our good judgement turned up to the party. ""Trigger finger"" was an amazing take on an old fashioned and ""the intervention"" was the best fruity and light whiskey concoction I've had in some time. Our waiter was handsome, flirty, and funny all while being helpful and so attentive. As far as the food....the choices were endless with every kind of cuisine. But somehow most of the food didn't leave a lasting impression of being packed with an amazing array of flavors like its sister restaurant ""beauty and essix"". Overall definitely SKIP the spicy Korean rice cakes and the octopus. The rice cakes tasted like spiced marshmallows and the octopus was just tiny and felt like nothing. The rest was pretty ok, but again the food looked so fun, fancy, and delicious, but the flavors just didn't seem to come together. Overall....GO! And request to be seated in the first room, and then explore to the back as well. But don't expect too much from the food. Go just for the entertainment of a great evening set to glamorous street art .  And dress up... It's a sceney pricey spot... So many selfies and poses going around.

3.0,5/6/2016,"My visit to Vandal was a love hate relationship. I made reservations for 4 and didn't get seated till 45 min after my reservation time. I was pretty pissed about that. The food was pretty good. The red snapper tostadas blew my boyfriend away. He loved them. The portions are sooo small though, and expensive but i guess that's to expect at an NYC restaurant. I would order medium sized options next time. We had three different desserts, the donuts, smorz and churros. Smorz was the best, churros with spiced chocolate was pretty good and the donuts were ehh. One of the bus boys took away one of our plates before we were done eating it.. Had like half a rice ball left and being that they were expensive I was like wth! That's like 4 bucks right there lol kind of felt rushed, but they were cleaning up after us pretty efficiently so I guess it was a good service gesture. I just wish we didn't feel so rushed. This stuck up biotch next to us gave my sister a look after she got up to leave and her coat brushed against her arm... Some of the crowd looked like stuck up rich folk, wasn't feelin it. :/ but the flower shop entrance was cute and the decor and ambiance is what you really pay for at this place.

The staff was great but I found some of the food hit or miss.Pan con tomate - B - enjoyed this. Garlic bread with tomato and prosciuttoArancini - C - I love cacio e pepe but these arancini tasted more like lemon rice balls. I love the concept but would love to see this a bit more traditional.Bao - A - yum. The bun was buttery, the meat tasty, slaw was creamy. Really enjoyed this Pizza - B - we had the tomato pie and mushroom. Very good. Papaya salad - C - good but would have been better if they went totally traditional. I think it needed more flavorBranzino - C - decent but a bit overcooked. Creamy corn - A - Mexican street corn in a bowl. Delicious! Steak with egg - D - the steak was overcooked, underseasoned.

5.0,5/4/2016,"This week's fashionplate is a much overdue dinnertime visit to Bowery hotspot- Vandal.  I've been a bunch for drinks and the club but have been meaning to try the food.  I finally got the chance to get there for dinner and it definitely lived up to the hype.  I decided to rock our brand new F/W16 Ellie Henley bodysuit for the perfect dinner to drinks to dancing outfit.  My dining companion and me were seated pretty promptly in this huge restaurant and club that formerly housed The General and Finale.  I love the flowershop entrance and all the great street art.  I tried the Sergeant Bell Pepper cocktail which had a great hint of spice and I also had the Lost & Found.  We were starving and split a ton of things.  The knish reuben was amazing who doesn't like meat, cheese, potato and thousand island dressing in one neat little package? The hot pretzel tartare was surprisingly tasty and flavorful.  The red snapper tostadas rounded out our small plates with a slightly more health conscious app. People love the johnnycakes but we thought they were just ok, would probably not get them again, not as special as the remainder of the items we ordered.  The wild mushroom pizza was amazing, orgasm in my mouth, can eat this once a week good.  We went with one main, the branzino which was also delish.  We probably over ordered by one or two items but yolo.  We rounded out the meal with something sweet the smores which you can see got me all kinds of googly eyed.All in all a great meal, definitely an all night spot from drinks to dinner and then late night dancing.  The crowd was mostly young working professionals and downtown scensters with some tourists thrown in.  This is definitely a spot to take a fashion risk and try something new.",7,0,7,Sascha M.,"New York, NY",593,822,7

4.0,5/2/2016,"I made a reservation for Saturday night long in advance and was very excited to try this new spot in the Lower East Side. Chis Santos's other restaurant Beauty & Essex is a personal favorite so I had high hopes. Unfortunately, my coworker sent me a pretty scathing article about Vandal from Eater the day before the reservation and I got nervous it would be a huge disappointment.  Thankfully, I ended up really enjoying the meal. Between the 6 of us in the party we ordered 5 dishes which was the perfect amount of food. The sticky rice dumplings come in a delicious sweet chili sauce and the crispy bao buns where packed full of flavor. The grilled avocado salad was a nice light, refreshing course amidst the other heavier choices on the menu. We also had the mushroom pizza at the recommendation of our waitress and it was fantastic.Our final course was the chicken & chorizo paella which was kind of a let down. There really just wasn't much to it and it was the only thing I tried that I would not order again. The food wasn't too outrageously priced, but I do wish they noted the number or servings on the menu. For the most part everything in the small at and medium sections of the menu is served as an individual bite and the kitchen is happy to accommodate different group sizes by making the exact number you want. However, without the serving sizes noted on the menu the cost of what you're ordering is a bit of a mystery. And while the food is reasonably priced, the $16 cocktails and $9 beers can quickly run up the bill. If you do want a drink I would recommend the pushcart wars cocktail with spicy habanero tequila which was really delicious. The dining experience at Vandal is less about the food and more about the scene. The restaurant is designed beautifully and the place just has a cool, trendy vibe. This would be a great place for a special occasion with a big group.",0,0,0,Casey B.,"Manhattan, NY",41,25,11

I guess it's the perfect blend, but not everything can be danced to.Prince died this past week so there were a few of his songs sprinkled in there.We had table service, very attentive service all night.

The food is a hodge podge of options - we ordered jimacia tacos which had butternut squash (my favorite dish), bread and yogurt sauce and a charred tomato pizza with spinach pesto.  Everything was perfectly delicious! We ordered cocktails which were just as good.   Dessert was no exception - we ordered a ""smore's"" themed dessert which came with a pie looking thing and ice cream - It was SO good!

1.0,4/24/2016,"The most unpleasant staff I have ever encountered.  Starting with the hostess and ending with our waitress, everyone was cold.  It's a shame as I was genuinely excited about trying out this spot.  An example of the poor hospitality the staff displayed was only about 15 minutes into sitting down.  About a few minutes after we initially ordered I asked the waitress if we could also have this other dish.  In response, she looked at me like I had just killed her family and goes (with some serious attitude), ""sure.""   Sure?  What are you confused?  Thick in the head? It is a simple yes.  Additionally, the food itself is pretty awful.  No flavors really stood out.  The only dish that was not awful were the seabass tacos (and I'm not saying it was good).I've always been impressed with the TAO group/Chris Santos however they have really let me down with this venue.  Train your staff on the fundamentals of hospitality and stop relying solely on your reputation.  Maybe pick up copies for everyone of ""Setting the Table"" by Danny Meyers and make it mandatory reading?  I will not be coming back to your venue and have informed my friends to not waste their time or money.",2,0,0,Andrew F.,"New York, NY",3,200,0

Stop rushing me!  I can live with all of that, but what I can't deal with is that it is wildly expensive for absolutely no reason. I'm a New Yorker. I'm used to a pricey life.

4.0,4/20/2016,"First of all I know this is NYC's newest ""hot spot"" and I see the appeal however I have to say the hype over this place isn't what I thought it would be... Let me get the bad out of the way first... I'll start off by saying they got my reservations wrong. I wanted Friday at 11 and I got the email saying Thursday. Called back and they did correct it but only had 12am available. Also I'm not a huge fan of tapas however based off the menu I thought they had some interesting food concepts yet once we received our order it quickly proved why fancy and might I add pricey tapas lack substance and flavor. The ""Peruvian"" ceviche came in a shot glass sized portion  and while we knew it was a single serving that's just tiny. The fish was fresh but it came in a white sauce that had a weird aftertaste... They called it Leche De Tigre but... Btw I was with a Peruvian and she definitely did not approve. Moving on... The Crispy Bau Buns which come with brisket was ok, the brisket was too dry for my taste but the slaw was good. Lastly and the only thing I'd order again are the Banh Mi'eatball Sliders... Delicious and actually this is the second incarnation of them according to the manager but these I will admit were delicious. So here are the highlights... First of all my review and everyone I know who has been here all agree that this place is stylish and very beautiful in terms of atmosphere and decoration. We were seated in the room with all the OBEY artwork on the walls. So for this they get points because vibe plays a key role where you spend a couple hours and money... Secondly the service at least from what I experienced was spot on and our waiter was great... Very attentive and made some great drink selections. Speaking of drinks, if you're a guy who likes whiskey which is pretty much every guy on social media at this point you do have to try the ""Blowing Smoke"" which is aged in house and very smooth. For the ladies I must say ""Las Palmitas"" is sweet enough with just the right amount of kick. Now I did actually try a second drink solely based off the name which was the ""Castor Troy""... If you're a guy over the age of 30 you know this is Nick Cages character in Face Off and needless to say this was exactly like the movie... You think it's good at first then it just doesn't make any sense. The waiter loved how I described this so he brought over his manager Michael so I could ""complain"" and when I did we all had a great laugh then had a whole conversation about Nick Cages poor movie choices... This by far was the highlight of the night as Michael comped me this bad drink and gave me another Blowing Smoke. This place gets 4 stars off the strength of that. Oh and the night I went Katie Fucking Holmes shut the whole lounge downstairs down to celebrate with her parents after the TriBeCa film festival. All in all its a trendy experience and now I can say I've been there. I'd go back on a Saturday with friends to see Statik Selektah spin since that's the homies homie...

3.0,4/18/2016,"i love chris santos's restaurants. they always have great energy and such fun plays on food. thus i was very excited to try out vandal. we had made reso's way in advance and still had to do an early dinner (5:30pm). the space here is huge and is decorated with different street art (graffiti etc) as the menu here focuses on different cultures' ""street vendor"" style food. think like chicken & rice, tacos, pizza etc. we all started off with some very tasty cocktails and then decided to stick to small/medium plates vs. the larger ones to try more. the menu really is kind of all over the place, which made it fun to select items. favorites- ceviche, oysters (came with avacodo and a tasty mignonette), grilled corn, crispy eggplant, s'mores dessert (with amazing graham cracker ice cream), and the crispy bao buns. so so- steak tartare pretzel (needed salt or something), chicken tacquitos, greek doughnuts, and schwarma salad. service here was excellent, our server was very helpful and friendly. i feel like there are still some kinks that need to be worked out across the menu, especially when you are paying such a pretty penny. vandal is not quiet yet at the level of stanton social/ beauty and essex. unfortunately our dinner was done pretty early so we didn't stay around to check out the lounges/ clubs space, just was not that time yet.",2,2,1,Christina G.,"New York, NY",323,458,565

3.0,4/16/2016,Vandal restaurant was full of beautiful people with questionable manners and some ok food. This is the new hit spot in town. And it is. Hard to get a reservation. I was able to get a table for 3 at 11:15. Was sat at 11:45 which wasn't too bad honestly. The bartenders make great drinks. The crowd at the bar is fun to talk to and beautiful to look at. Lots of pretty people waking by and through you without saying excuse me or sorry can get annoying pretty fast. This was to a point where a whole conversation started about manners. It was that bad. But. As we know. Beautiful and entitled come sometimes(not always) with questionable manners. To the food. The Bao buns were great. The shrimp arepa was good The little burger was delicious and juicyThe steak was good. The rice it comes with was not. Drinks are strong and prices were fine in my opinion. The server was Piaget. Stunning and really knew her stuff. It would be 4 stars if we were sat on time and the crowd which is and is not the establishments fault would have been a tad more respectful of personal space.

5.0,4/16/2016,"If you've ever been to Chef Santos' other spots in the city, Stanton Social or Beauty and Essex, you'll be familiar with the set up. Plates meant for sharing. And much like the other two, you will be thrilled by this set up because it allows you to try a whole lot of food. The atmosphere of this new spot is exciting and inviting with amazing street art everywhere you look.  I wouldn't call it a FAMILY restaurant, but if you decide to bring your kids they will easily find plenty to enjoy from the menu. And lets face it...it's all about the food. Here we get upscale versions of street food from around the world. The waiters know the menu and are happy to share the history of the dishes and where they come from. Cocktails are fun and intriguing, and again the waiters seem to be very good at guiding you towards something you will really enjoy.  The best bite we had was the Banh Mi. A very unusual and delightful version of the Vietnamese sandwich staple. The bun itself is actual a coconut pudding prepared to emulate a bun...and it's texture and flavor combined with the pork belly and pickled vegetables is amazing. We were also captivated with the Chicken Katsu on Hong Kong Egg Waffles. Unlike another reviewer, we had no issue with the waffle, ours was delicious and the combination of the chicken, three sauces, waffle and collard greens was a perfect bite. We also enjoyed the Bacon and Miso Ramen, which was perfect at our table. We too enjoyed the delicious Cacio e pepe Arancini balls with the lemon zest and the parmesan espuma. We also tried the Brussles Sprouts elote, which reminded me of Mexican street corn.  Maybe a bit of heat would make this already delicious dish a touch better.  The menu is full of so many items I can't wait to come back and try.

4.0,4/13/2016,"I celebrated my Birthday here at Vandal just last night. My overall experience was a good one but it wasn't without a few disappointments. First of which myself & the 5 who came to celebrate with me were made to wait over an hour to be seated even though we had reservations (that were made a month in advance)! I hope that is not the standard wait time, which I don't believe it to be since we witnessed practically everyone that entered AFTER us get seated BEFORE we did. Our 9:45pm reservations didn't get us seated until 11pm-ish. I could understand if we were Walk-ins but to have a reservation, be asked repeatedly if we're all there & replying ""Yes"" to which we were still ignored for that long is not cool. The food got mixed reviews, the blacked shrimp, the spicy quinoa and the brisket in a bun were enjoyed by most but the Steak Tartare on a pretzel was not well received. Nor was the slider, or the salmon that topped the quinoa. The dessert was honestly the Best part. The Vandal Smores & the Black and White crepe cake were Fantastic! They were undoubtedly the highlights of the meal portion. I also very much liked the oysters (which is never had before but decided to try for the first time here at Vandal). The other disappointment was being told that the 3 orders we placed of the Chilean Sea Bass tacos could not be fulfilled as they had run out of sea bass! That was such a downer as I'd been looking forward to that the most, hence why we placed 3 orders of it. We were told by our fun, super friendly & professional waiter, Elliot, that we would have to order something else. Perhaps if we were not made to wait so long to be seated we might've gotten to taste and enjoy what I most liked forward to having, but who knows? Getting back to our waiter, Elliot. He was very helpful and knowledgeable with regards to the menu and helped each one in our party navigate the choices. He was timely, efficient and really nice. He even snapped a few pics for our table. My only hope where he's concerned was that he returned for his tip as I like to give or see them get their tips and like to emphatically thank them for their service when it is superb but I did not get the chance. Overall, we had fun and my birthday was enjoyed not only by me but by my guests as well. We all loved the decor, ambiance & the countless murals and various works of Art displayed throughout the truly beautiful space. We even met a nice gentleman named Mauricio who said he was involved with the building/making of the space who introduced us to one of the owners, we were told. We took many photos & also used the super fun video frame/booth. Were it not for the 2 hiccups (the Drastic wait time & the running out of the thing you want most) I would have given it 5 stars.",4,2,1,Marilynn D.,"Huntington, NY",59,7,42
4.0,4/12/2016,"Much like all its brother and sister restaurants, Vandal is impossibly cool in decor and vibe. Covered in graffiti, you'll enter through an unmarked door in back of a flower shop. I treated my niece to dinner on a night with a red carpet out front, showcasing a Sports Illustrated event (AKA you'll want to dress trendy, as it's a scene and you'll BE seen). We went nuts and shared 6 plates between the two of us, and it was SO MUCH food! Our choices were the Cacio e Pepe Arancini, New York Hot Pretzel Steak Tartare, Sticky Rice Dumplings, Blackened Shrimp Arepas, Crispy Bao Buns, and Chicken Katsu with Hong Kong Egg Waffles. The Arepas are a must order if you can handle a little Cajun heat. They are bursting with flavor and our favorite bite! The sticky rice dumplings were also the more delicious of the two ball-shaped dishes, with more flavor development and chili sauce as an added kick. The Bao Buns were good if you're into sweet, and I was a big fan of the steak tartare+pretzel combo. Just a tip, the waffle of the chicken and waffles has a heavy lime flavor that caught us off guard and we weren't fans. Our waiter was awesome though and took the dish right back! Everything else was great, including dessert. My drink, the Lost and Found, could have been better. But I'd love to return and try some others!

After about 10 minutes, she was seen ascending the steps. The swarm pressed in trying to get her attention. She let a couple of people in, but ignored the rest. Like she literally wouldn't give anyone eye contact so people couldn't even try to talk to her. One guy tried touching her elbow, but security batted it away. When she finally looked up, I asked her if we could go in and she said, ""sure."" As simple as that, The Pearly Gates opened up and we were in! The lounge itself wasn't that crowded, which, I guess, is thanks to St. Peter upstairs. The music was hip hop/r&b, which is exactly my jam.

They were pretty good but I could say that I've had better. But the vibe and the ambience really make the night special. We had dinner in one of the rooms on the top floor and then went to the lounge area downstairs and had cocktails. Dinner was mediocre, as vegetarians we didn't have a huge variety of options but we did enjoy the wild mushroom pizza. The salads were also surprisingly good, and I normally am not satisfied with eating salads.

3.0,4/4/2016,"I love Beauty & Essex.  I haven't been to Stanton Social in years, but enjoyed this place back in the day.  When I heard that a new restaurant was added to the group, I was very excited to see what this place would bring to the food/nightlife scene in the LES.  I'm constantly in search of places that provide both nightlife and quality food.  Food: We had the Tuna Crudo, Banh Mi'Eatball Sliders, Johnny Cakes, Crispy Bao Buns, and Brussel Sprouts.  The Johnny Cakes were the clear WINNER!  They were amazing!  I would go back just for this.  Everything else was ok.  The Crudo didn't appear to be really fresh.  The Crispy Bao Buns were dry and the Brussel Sprouts had an overly salt/vinegar after taste.Atmosphere: The décor was amazing.  I loved the music.  I was dancing in my seat most of the night.  It was packed on Thursday night around 10:30 pm, lively and great people watching as well. Service: The service was spotting at times, but not a distraction.  Overall, we had a great time.  The food is better at Beauty & Essex, but the drinks and atmosphere was what I've come to expect from this restaurant group.  I will probably go back for the Johnny Cakes, drinks, and music.  This is great place for big groups or girls night out.",2,0,0,Christina T.,"Chicago, IL",22,97,363
5.0,4/4/2016,"There's a lot of hype surrounding this new trendy hot spot on Bowery in Manhattan... Now I know why!You enter through a Flower shop (reminds me of Beauty and Essex where you enter through a Pawn Shop).The Drinks... I went for the (Spicy) Las Palmitas and PushCart Wars and my friend opted for the (Sweet) Double Dutch... Drinks are on the pricey side but they were nice and strong.The Food... It's Tapas Style and as per the waiters suggestion, we ordered 5 dishes to share (typical for a party of two). Our picks were the Blackened Shrimp Arepas (delicious!), Grilled Avocado (love love love avocado) tossed with salad and candied pecans, Ceviche (my first time trying),  Chicken and Chorizo Paella served in a skillet with roasted tomato sofrito (that was yummy), and at last, The Vandal S'mores  Desert (heaven in my mouth!). It's a warm S'mores pie with a scoop of graham cracker ice cream.The Decor... There's an icy, grape colored, break dancing bunny. Graffiti covers the walls throughout, and there's tons of artwork to take in... The ambiance is amazing and the space is stunning! I'm happy we went on a Sunday evening to explore the two level space. The restaurant consists of a bar/lounge, full dining room, garden dining area, private dining room, and cellar bar/lounge.AND...Before you leave, don't forget to take a video strutting your stuff on the ""Vandal Cam"" so you can send it to yourself via email; perfect for your social media accounts!Like my review?

Service: The wait staff is immense, many waiters, busboys, etc. I can't recall if we had one or two waiters. Drinks: Well done. Pushcart Wars, was very good, spicy! Food: Excellent. Oysters were fresh and the accompaniments were good. The Tomahawk was good, we requested medium rare, but the steak was a little more than that. Which is a big no-no for a steak that price. Conclusion: I expected more from a place this hyped and priced. Plenty of great places in NYC to eat. This place is best for drinks late at night. Second Visit?

We had a midnight reservation and it was the perfect time to go. The food also did not disappoint! There were three of us and we couldn't decide since all of the options were so unique-we ended up ordering like half the menu. Way too much food but you really do have to experience everything on this menu! We got the Cesar salad pizza, the mushroom pizza, the sticky rice dumplings, bao buns, bacon and miso ramen, mole chicken taquitos, the pretzel with steak tartar, and the ceviche. Like I said, a lot of food! But I would order every single thing again! My personal favorites were the taquitos, the steak tartar pretzel, the mushroom pizza and the ramen. We couldn't finish of course, but somehow found room for dessert! We ordered the s'mores cake. It was a wonderful finish to the night.

5.0,4/3/2016,"My husband and I were happy all around with our experience at Vandal.  I'm a big Chopped fan, and have been looking forward to trying one of Chris Santos restaurants.  Since my husband is not much of a foodie as I am, however his love for the recently ""whited out"" 5 points,  made me think he would enjoy Vandal. The ambiance itself is worth it.   Vandal has a speakeasy feel as you walk thru a flower shop to get in.  The walls are covered with murals either chipped in concrete or spray painted on the walls-the place is gorgeous.   Our table for a two was a little tight, considering this was a small plate menu. Our waitress was very knowledgeable about the menu and suggested not only how many items to order, but gave excellent recommendations.   I was happily surprised to see a special blue special menu supporting autism research, and ordered the blueberry rum drink which was slightly sweet, and fresh.  My husband thought the beer menu could be a little more diverse then it was, but settled on a speakeasy ale. We stared with the mushroom pizza and sea bass tacos,  both suggested by our waitress.  The pizza was a good size and light and crispy.  The tacos were delicious!  Fish was fresh, the tangy crispy slaw and spicy sauce were a perfect combination.  The NY pretzel was very different, and definitely something I would I recommend.  I was a little worried about the mustard seeds, again my husband is kinda picky about food, but they weren't over powering.  The pretzel was soft  and the kobe melted in my mouth.   We ended with the flank steak over the chorizo fries rice.  Wow, was this good!!!!!!!   The steak was cooked perfectly, there was no need to use the steak knife as you could use the side of the fork.  The rice was a nice complement with a occasional shot of heat from the thinly sliced peppers.   The poached egg,brought all the flavors together.   With just under $150 for our bill, no room for dessert, we were very happy with this dining experience.  Looking forward to trying beauty and Essex next.",1,0,1,Kristen P.,"Somerville, MA",24,47,26
3.0,4/2/2016,"I loved the food here. I got the Caesar pizza (AMAZING) But this place is so close to being overrated and it hasn't been open that long. It was sooooo jam packed to the point it became a one way traffic of people waiting to just pass by a table to get to the other side of the restaurant. I made a reservation 3 months ago for my birthday April 1st @ 10:00 and for 10 people. When we got there at 9:40 (making sure that we're extremely early because they warned me being late would result in us loosing our table) we never got seated until 11:00. Within that hour wait for our RESERVED table we were trying to figure out what was going on and the hostess kept blowing us off and sending us to the bar (which had over 30 people by it). Then the host sarcastically told me ""Well this is what happens when you're dealing with humans and you can't control how long they take to eat [smile]. Although this is true, she was being so sarcastic in the way she said it. But When we finally got seated the waitress was extremely nice to us and even took some things off the bill because of how long we had to wait.

1.0,3/31/2016,"Came here Tuesday night and On a scale of 1 to bottom of the bag McDonald's fries how salty was this food? Saltier than an ex who sees you doing much better without them. By the end of the meal my lips felt like I was sipping on ocean water all night. Chilean sea bass tacos good but salty af. Bao buns saltier af. I had the buns a few days ago on my first visit and they were pretty good. Chef must of took the night off, the cooks were probably salty and took it out on the food. Grilled pork steak salty! The mole taquitos were very good. The grilled avocado was ok. Too much dressing and only give you four slices of avocado for $14. And wtf are reservations for? Had a 945 and was seated close to and hour later. My complaints were met with a polite idgaf. The only bright spot of the night was Marina the bar tender who took care of me on both visits. A sweetheart who knows how to make a drink. She's the only reason I'd come back and hang out by the bar. Eff that overpriced high blood pressure food. It was actually pretty terrible so we drank more alcohol (straight up) and it made us feel better. The spot is cool the people look good but there's a strong aroma of douchiness, especially with the front of house staff. You can almost see the scent emanating from their pores. If I have a hot date or feel like picking one up I'll pass by and have some Don Julio on the rocks. If I get hungry I'm sure there's a McDonald's nearby and I'll grab some salty ass fries off the dollar menu rather than pay 15-20 for a small plate marinated in deep sea water",15,11,8,Peter R.,"Nashville, TN",377,161,198
4.0,3/30/2016,"You enter through the flower shop which would have been handy to know in advance as, given how brashly marked the restaurant is from the outside, not being able to find the door is just a bit annoying. The specially commissioned artworks, most notably the Vhils installations in the main dining room, are magnificent but the framed pieces of urban art in the bar and bar adjacent dining area - particularly a weak Invader print - let the decor down and look awkward and tbh a bit cheap (I'm from London which could make a difference to how I see these pieces but I doubt it). There are wonderfully grand pieces that make beautiful use of the space right opposite works that aren't that special and some even have the classic thick black framing - eeek - so for me the artwork theme was a bit off, very haphazardly curated and some poor choices but obviously it's art and everyone will have their own view on that. The bar service was good, the cocktails decent and the dining room waiter was excellent - full of helpful suggestions, recommendations and easily able to answer questions on vegetarian dishes. The front desk staff were very sweet but also came across as a bit clueless - we had an early reservation for a table for two at 5.15pm but weren't seated until at least 6pm and that was after going to ask what was happening. It wasn't busy at all so not sure what the hold up was - no explanation or apology was given.  The main dining room was buzzy, even at a very early sitting, and the food was divine. I cannot recommend this highly enough for vegetarians particularly the crispy aubergine side and the crispy rice cakes which are like gnocchi and so moreish. I'd imagine it's a great late night spot and am assuming the hosting issues are teething troubles given it's still quite new so should hopefully be ironed out. I'd definitely go back for the food and lovely dining room wait staff so heartily recommend but would just say don't be in a hurry and don't expect too much from the art side of things.",0,0,0,Sarah M.,"London, United Kingdom",1,22,99
4.0,3/29/2016,"* This Review is for the Bar and Drinks, not Food *As many of you already know, Vandal, opened to much acclaim as the owner is Tao Group, of the highly successful Tao chain of restaurants/clubs.They took over the old Finale Club location and have turned it into a beautiful space.  I personally think the Tao Downtown location is still their best and most beautiful spot, but that's just my opinion.We went mainly for drinks and were impressed with the ambiance and cocktail list.  We took a look at the menu and saw many of the dishes pass by us as we were by the bar/kitchen area, but to be honest, the food didn't look that impressive.  I can't say it's not, as we didn't have any, but visually didn't look great.The menu is comprised of 'street food' options from all over the world, so that sounds interesting, but not sure if I wanna have all the different types at once, lol.  Will have to come back to try it to give it a full review.But as far as just coming to the bar and having drinks, it's a beautiful bar, with a decent crowd, and decent drinks, albeit on the pricier side - $78 (including tip) for 4 drinks, so, almost $20/drink.  But you have to expect that in Downtown Manhattan and cause they're basically trying to be the high-end Tao-type place of the Lower East Side.Overall, we had a nice, albeit short time there, and will probably come back for food.  But even just for drinks, I recommend it...just know that there's a price for it!",13,5,11,Elton W.,"New York, NY",1010,377,1497

Did not expect so many families with little kids, but it wasn't a Saturday night. My favorite dish was the semolina charred tomato pizza (nicely charred and crispy). My least favorite was the overcooked flavorless red snapper tostado. Also good was the chicken shawarma salad. The mini burger reminded us of White Castle. Some would think that's a compliment, perhaps it was the velveeta like cheese. The ramen had almost no broth and the noodles seemed like cupanoodles. More broth might have improved the dish. maybe we shouldn't have had Mexican, Japanese, Middle Eastern, American and Italian all in one meal. Its just odd and doesn't work.

Entering through Ovando (one of my favorite flower + candle stores) was a nice little treat, and the nice, high-ceilinged entrance hall was a nice nod to Tao, but the inside, service, and food pale in comparison to both Tao uptown and downtown. The place is large, of course, with each section slightly differing from the next, but all dimly lit and incorporates both street art, and upscale American dining ambiance. In theory it would look good, but it simply didn't feel all that nice I know the concept is street food, but at those prices, I'd want to feel a bit more pampered. Bathroom was marked with simply white graffiti but can easily be confused for a broom closet. I tried the most recommended appetizers and entree and were disappointed by all of them. Red snapper toastada was probably my least hated of the batch, as the snapper was prepared well, but the chip was eh. Mini reuben sandwiches were a huge let down as I could barely taste the corned beef and the whole thing just meshed in my mouth... no texture. Katsu fried chicken on hong kong style waffle did not work at all. Vandal infused the waffle with thai basil and it tasted really awful. Plus I can make better fried chicken in my own home. For $28, this dish was a huge no-no. Busser also clanked all the silverware and dishes while he was cleaning.

Great setting, nice to bring out of towners or for a special night out. Our waitress was amazing, fun and gave us great recs..I went to dinner with another girlfriend, we tried the sweet potato empanadas, the tuna crudo, the cacio peppe dumplings and the mushroom pizza. All the food, esp the crudo and the empanadas were great. It's a great place to come w a group as most things were small bites and you'll get to try a bunch. The menu is quite overwhelming and could use some editing but I guess thEre was enough variety for anyone to find something!i had really yummy cocktails, especially the one with the bell pepper juice (first one on the spicy list) although it's not really spicy, just had a kick to it. Love the flower shop at the entrance!The only thing I didn't love is the host situation is aggressive. I get it, it sucks, it's busy, people are being pushy, it's NY. But I'm out to have a good time and I made a reservation so let's play nice!I didn't think it was affordable but it wasn't ridiculous either, we had those four plates (took 2 slices of pizza home), 2 cocktails, a glass of wine, dessert and a 2 coffees for about 165$ with tax/tip (20%) for both of us.",3,1,1,Peggy J.,"New York, NY",6,127,87

I loved the place so much, I just brought my father that was in town for dinner last night. We waited for our table in the downstairs lounge bar (which is GORGEOUS!). The tapas style street food is incredible. You can't really go wrong with what you order. I'm a vegetarian, and our waitress was incredible with suggestions for my meatless selections. I'd recommend the thai papaya salad, za'atar bread, broccoli johnnycakes, asparagus, and the greek donuts.

3.0,3/16/2016,"SummaryThis is a brand new spot that brings a taste of the meatpacking to the lower east.  Obviously, the new ""it"" spot for celebrities and celebrity-hangers-on.  Quite a bit on the douchey side, unfortunately.Atmosphere Pretty cool with the graffiti and decor.  Massive, massive space.  The dining floor is split into multiple rooms all with tables well spaced out.  The crowd is a wide range of celebrities, their entourages, and healthy serving douchey B&T.  The lounge area downstairs is kept sealed tight by a smoke show of a tall blonde who thinks is hotter than she really is and has no idea how to crowd control.  Of the several times I've visited this place it's been hit or miss with her letting our group in or not. Of the times she cited too many guys in our group (eventually letting us in), there was about 80% women downstairs.  I mean, seriously?  Keep it 50/50 and you'll have a much better crowd girl.  Get someone else to work the door that knows what he or she is doing.FoodPretty decent.  Not bad, not out of this world.  They better keep innovating if they want to stay in business because I'm sure the rent for this space is astronomical.DrinksAgain, decent.ServiceVery friendly and knowledgeable waitstaff.  However, as other reviewers have noted, the hosting is an absolute sh-tshow.  Came here with reservations and at no point were we ever seated anywhere near close to on time.  The tall ""bouncer"" chick holding the reigns at the door to the downstairs lounge has no idea how to crowd control.  I'm not complaining about there being 80% women in the lounge, by no means.  But you can't be denying entry to dudes saying too many dudes in a group if the crowd downstairs desperately needs balance.  Overall, it's the service that makes this place very douchey a la meatpacking.",1,2,0,Paul H.,"Manhattan, NY",193,347,178

[I was told by a friend the next day that once the cocktails are explained by the bartender that I will view them differently].The decor is amazing, and the crowd was even better. The venue is huge, which is perhaps why management felt the need to design a menu with such a wide reach.

The renovation was well done and everything looked high quality and stunning throughout, down to the hallways and bathrooms. The bar was packed, but set up in a nice way with small tables and banquet seating across from the bar. Surprisingly, it wasn't hard to get a table there while we waiting for our reservation. By the way, it seems almost impossible to get a reservation between 7-9pm most days but we snagged an 8:30 with a little strategic planning.While we ate their tapas style food, we noticed large groups of party people walking by, to go down to the lounge in the basement that had door girls and a rope. There was also a fresh coffee stand inside the restaurant staffed by two baristas.  The sad thing is that none of the food blew me away. We didn't finish even the tostadas which had 3 small pieces on the plate, shared by two. We didn't try any large plates so those might be better.After dinner, we went down to the lounge, no issue getting in, danced and had another drink. The layout wasn't too conducive to meeting new people and talking, but the music was great and it would be a good place for a group to get a table. It's a medium sized place with a small dance floor.Although the food wasn't stellar, it is certainly good enough and this is the current hot spot, so add this to your list.",4,3,4,Saba F.,"St. Louis, MO",210,159,368

My plate was cleared and gone before hers ever arrived. How were the brisket buns you ask? Aside from being way too salty ""They are good if I like pork"" says the waitress who obviously didn't know the difference between pork and beef when I asked what on the menu she would recommend.

Since it's new and hot, it's impossible to get a reservation at a normal time so I chose the not so popular 6:30pm time slot on a Saturday night. Due to unforeseen circumstances and NYC traffic, I was running late. I was literally in tears in the Uber car because I knew my reservation would be given away. I had my brother and his g/f already there but of course unless your entire party is there, you will not be seated. I ran into the flower shop which is the front for the restaurant and sure enough after arriving late, I was told my table was given away (gasp...nooooooo!). I was given a pager and told I could have drinks at the bar until a table became available (by someone else canceling or arriving late) or eat at the lounge downstairs with a limited menu. I knew I would never get a table waiting but I took my chances and went to the bar to mingle with all the beautiful and cool people there. I pretended to fit in. I looked around and the b/f could tell I was going to burst in tears if I didn't eat here so he marched over to the hostess and very politely explained that it was his first time hanging out with his girlfriend's brother and really needed to make a good impression or he would be going home alone (ok a little exaggerated but the first part was true). My honey had the magic touch! 10 minutes later, my pager went off! We had a table (thanks Katie)! and not in some random obscure corner. It was right in the middle of the main room! I could have kissed the hostess at that moment! Our waiter, Dante was the best! He helped recommend plate sizes and meals to compliment the few my brother already knew he had to have based on instagram photos. We ordered: -KNISH REUBEN corned beef / sauerkraut / swiss / thousand island-CRISPY BAO BUNS brisket / crunchy asian slaw / sesame -GRILLED CHILEAN SEA BASS TACOS avocado / chipotle slaw / salsa diablo -CHICKEN KATSU + HONG KONG EGG WAFFLES braised collard greens  (this was my least favorite)-JERK SPICED SALMON quinoa / wilted greens / scotch bonnet+blood orange gastrique -PRIME SKIRT STEAK chinese sausage fried rice / sunny side up egg / scallions / chile -JERK SPICED SALMON quinoa / wilted greens / scotch bonnet+blood orange gastrique -BRUSSELS ELOTE chipotle kewpie / queso fresco / cilantro / lime  Definitely WAY TOO MUCH food for four people. We shared everything so we could all get a taste. Our waiter was also nice enough to let us know which dishes only came with 3 servings and added an extra one so we were all able to try everything. The waffle was my least favorite. It tasted almost like it had some lavender or something. The table favorite were the Knish and the Steak. Everything had so much flavor! Again I don't think you can go wrong with anything here. Since we ordered so much food we had no room left for dessert.  I wish I could remember the name of the cocktail I ordered (im learning to start taking notes!). The ambiance was awesome. Each room had a different art on the walls. Even the bathrooms were gorgeous! Dark and sleek. Music was really good. There was a coffee cart towards the back. I didnt make it to the lounge downstairs and it was roped off by the time we were leaving so not sure if it was hard to get into or not. There is a photo op everywhere you walk in this place. I walked into another garden room and wanted to take a group pic. The staff here must be used to this because as soon as one of them saw me trying to figure out where to take the pic, he pointed to the back wall, took my phone and said over there, thats the best spot, and proceeded to take our pic (thanks Mike!). All the staff here was very pleasant with the exception of one of the hostesses in the front who never smiled but i'm sure her job must not be easy with everyone trying to get into this place.Definitely check this place out.

Def order them to start!Sticky rice dumplings- tasted great interesting texture due to sticky rice... It's REALLY stickyCrispy bao buns-soooooooooo good def get them they are the perfect brisket bao bun, love that it's not pork belly like most places.Chicken katsu + Hong Kong egg waffles- slightly over sauced with katsu sauce but the chicken cutlet was perfect (crispy outside and juicy chicken on the inside) I've never had Hong Kong egg waffles but it was SUPER dry... Maybe they should put the katsu sauce BETWEEN the chicken cutlet and the egg waffle instead of on top of the whole thing?Drinks- not diluted and tasted great. I forget the name but I had a spicy tequila cocktail.Ambience- SUPER scene, SUPER loud (felt bad for wait staff, how do they have a voice at the end of the night?) but most Tao group restaurants are like this. Music was awesome! A lot of 90's hip hop/rap (my jam). Great staff, great service, friendly but a little slow which is understandable considering how busy it was) Side note: yea there's a club downstairs (music was mostly top 40 rap), we were all chicks so no problem getting in, was a little mellow for a Friday night. Seemed like it was busy when we got down there around 130 but cleared out a ton by 230... Strange, maybe it's where ppl start the night then relocate? People were dressed pretty casual not like super clubby. Also a friend of mine went and ordered different things than I did (can't remember what it was) and said It wasn't great and super expensive so... Maybe ask your waiter what they suggests and just get a couple things to share. We ordered 4 things on the menu between 4 girls and 2 cocktails each and the bill was ABOUT $60 a person.All in all...

It's TRASH.3)Blackened Shrimp Arepas - I liked it, wife hated them.4) Wild Mushroom Pizza - very good.5)Red Snapper Tostatas - very good.We came very hungry, prepped to spend much more money but we filled up fast.  We didn't have any space for dessert - DOH! My best advice to you folks out there is to bring friends. This is a cool date spot, but after all the anticipation, I kind of wish I had the ability to try more of the items on the menu. Oh well, maybe next time?There is a lounge downstairs but you either need to have a reservation to get in or you got to show up early.",1,0,1,Biru S.,"Mamaroneck, NY",333,671,153
1.0,3/1/2016,"TERRIBLE customer service, especially at the door.  I went this past weekend with a group of friends and we were told we had to wait to get in because there were ""too many penises"". So we patiently waited off to the side and while waiting the girl at the door let more guys in. It just so happened that the guys in my group were Hispanic and we had to wait, but for some reason there was room for more white guys. How does that make sense??? After seeing that happen and complaining, the girl let us girls go downstairs but the guys still had to wait. We went downstairs to find it was almost all females and it wasn't even packed. Ridiculous. And they played crappy music. I'd give zero stars if I could. I will never go back.",0,2,0,Stephanie I.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",6,7,5

The bussers made sure any empty plates didn't stay on the table for any longer than 30 seconds, our server was professional, courteous, and knowledgeable with the ingredients on the menu. She accommodated to my vegan dietary preference and confirmed with the back of the house to assure no dairy or animal ingredients were in any of my selections.

It took about 15 minutes to get a menu from the bartender. He was nice and offered good service afterward, but if you're paying that much for quality then it should reflect in your service as well. That is the only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars. Other than that, their cocktails were well made and the plates I tried were also good. The restaurant quickly became busy. The bar was mostly full of people who seemed had just gotten out of work. Overall it's a good place with awesome street art.",0,0,0,Lilyanne G.,"South Gate, CA",6,37,14
4.0,2/28/2016,Upon arrival they have this really nice flower shop where you can buy stuff before you actually walk into the restaurant.The decor and painting in this place is just mind blowing. It's a very big place and they have a downstairs also. For drink I decided to go with the Castro Troy since it was under spicy cocktail and I like spicy. The New York hot pretzel steak tartare was okay the steak tartare seemed bland. The blackened shrimp arepas were great with tremendous taste.. The crispy bao buns were heavenly...by far the best thing we ordered. Now the last two things we got were the grilled Chilean sea bass tacos and heaven spot mini burger. The burger was cooked perfectly it had melted cheese inside the burger. The fish tacos were delicious with great flavor. The food in this place is very appealing. Great place to come with couples or friends it has a very cool vibe. Came to Vandal again on Saturday night.. Had reservations for 9:45 and did not get seated until about an hour later.. The place gets extremely busy on the weekends and the bar area where you can wait to be seated is overcrowded.. This time around we ordered the crispy bao buns because they are a must have item here.. The sticky rice dumplings which were phenomenal.. the sea bass tacos once again did not disappoint.. I saw so many people ordering the skirt steak entree the last time I came that I had to try it.. So glad I did! The taste of this dish is out of this world.. This time around everything we ordered was on point,10,6,8,Nick A.,"Astoria, Queens, NY",85,117,585
4.0,2/28/2016,"Like a child in a candy store I was mesmerized by the Ovando boutique at the entrance.. The flowers are so bright and enchanting that it's hard to keep your eyes off them as you walk through to get to the restaurant.. beyond the black door is another tease.. a reception area ahead.. with a coat check to the right of you and a gigantic pink bunny sculpture on your left.. still concealing what's to come.. once they were ready to take us to our table the real ""jaw-dropping"" began.. the space is tremendous.. which reminded me of it's affiliated Tao restaurants, specifically Tao Downtown... we walked past one dining area, then a space where a cart appeared carrying some old- school espresso machines and in that same area a line was forming to go downstairs.. Finally we got to our dining area which seemed to be as far as the restaurant goes.. the artwork in this place is impressive enough to keep me coming back.. People were either dressy or trendy.. The menu was a decent size and we ordered the following: The New York pretzel steak tartare.. which I thought could have had more taste.. I also thought that it tasted like raw meat.. and it is raw meat.. but I'm used to having steak tartare and not feeling like the cow is still alive.. then came the blackened shrimp arepas.. as soon as I bit down I immediately looked at my boyfriend's face and saw that he was actually enjoying his portion..so naturally I thought it must just be me.. But when we shared the third arepa he reacted accordingly and we both agreed that someone must have dropped the salt on two of our three arepas.. After that we got the Chilean sea bass tacos which were amazing and full of welcoming flavor.. My favorite dish of the night was the crispy bao buns which were perfect in every way.. I wish we had gotten two orders of those.. The mini burger came after and it was also good but hard to beat the bao buns at that point.. For dessert we had the vandal s'more.. The waitress had described it like a brownie with a graham crust topped with whipped cream and caramel and a scoop of ice cream on the side.. It was delicious but definitely not a brownie.. It was more like a pudding with graham cracker crust.. The service was excellent.. Will be back to try the rest of the menu even though it was disappointing that two of our dishes were dudsCame back to try some other things on their menu, skipped the dishes that were not the greatest the last time we came and hit the jackpot! The sticky rice dumplings were amazing.. So were the crispy bao buns which we obviously had to have again and the seabass tacos.. The skirt steak entree was soo good.. It was cooked to perfection and the taste was immense.. For dessert we got the greek donuts which I could have basically eaten all by myself.. Definitely a great establishment.. Just have to know what to order",3,2,2,Laura D.,"Astoria, Queens, NY",36,112,352

2.0,2/28/2016,"So my review is solely for the lounge area on its own since I didn't come here for dinner. I came to meet up with a two of my friends here to go to the lounge which is downstairs and have a good Saturday night. All simple? Not so much. I attempted to go downstairs and the person who was controlling the crowd to enter the lounge didn't let me in because ""everything was booked"" downstairs, or because ""I didn't have a reservation"", meanwhile people were just walking in and out with ease for whatever reason. Not to sound bitter, but I was practically ready to spend a nice amount of change to spend my night here with my friends but since the person at the stairs didn't think we could come in, they essentially denied myself and my friends entry to the lounge area. I understand the concept of ""crowd control"", but this place was just plain old rude with their management style. It basically killed the vibe of my Saturday night along with my buddies. I would love to give this place another shot (restaurant/lounge both) but it's not too hot right now consider how they wanted to treat their customers. Just another night in NYC nightlife I guess?  Whack. Only reason I'm giving two stars rather one...great music playing at all times.",2,1,0,Avi S.,"New York, NY",12,109,27

2.0,2/27/2016,"Loved the ambiance.But here's what went wrong:I held a reservation for 2 on the celebration of my birthday at 7pm. We arrived at 7:30 and couldnt get a table because 30 minutes was passed as ""too late""; unless we can return the table by 9p.m, which gives us an hour to eat? ....No, thank you. The alternative was to be seated in the first-come-first-serve section and we were promised that our time would not be rushed there.We ended up choosing the alternative. Even still, I felt we were rushed when our tables were cleaned immediately and the checkbook was handed over right then and there. That was really disappointing, #1#2, we ended up eating a full course meal on a coffee table!!! Sure, the couches were comfy, but who likes hunching over to eat? Hated that. we were left no other choice. Had I known this, I wouldve seeked another restaurant but every humble New Yorker knows for Friday night, it's unlikely to just walk-in any place without having made reservations!  I was pleasantly surprised at how big the ""2-pound"" lobster LOOKED when it arrived until I started digging in.Dont be fooled. They give you only 4 pieces of lobster and the bottom is just stuffed with rice; to give the illusion you're getting your money's worth. Everything about the lobster was mediocre. and for $70?..Who are you kidding! I wouldve moved onto desserts if I was seated at a better table. I didnt realize how bad it was until I took a walk through the other side, where the restroom is. Here's the overall pictureThe food was mediocre, service was mediocre.$200 for a hurried service/dinner that I didn't enjoy, or get to relax.Sorry, this place just didnt cut it for me.",1,0,1,K L.,"New York, NY",0,6,1
2.0,2/27/2016,"Waitstaff were friendly and attentive but the food was surprisingly poor. Was it bad? No. Bad is inedible. But this food was exceedingly mediocre. Many, MANY nearby restaurants beat the food quality here. In fact, the prior restaurant, The General, had better food! Every highlight on these Yelp reviews is a surprise because none of them were good: Bao Buns? Meh. Pizza? Meh. Dumplings? Meh. Tuna Tartare on a pretzel bun? Woof. Fish tacos? Meh. Without fail, every single dish we ordered was just average or below average fare. Surprisingly so, hence this review. For the money, you might as well head crosstown to RedFarm and get a knockout meal. Or for a combination of a scene and food, Catch. Frankly, Lavo would be better, or Tao! Or go to Buddakan for a sceney restaurant. ...That said, for a drink at the bar or in the lounge, it's worth it. Who can screw up a nice pour of whiskey? And the crowd is very good looking.

Attractive people. Ordered tons of stuff to share, standouts were the bao buns, the jerk salmon, and the pilaf stuffed lobster. Sea bass tacos , blackened shrimp arepa and chicken mole were fine. Wish we would have skipped the steak and rice dish and tried the branzino instead - was weak in flavor and a poor cut. Deserts: smores and donuts were great. Churros come with a spicy chocolate sauce, love the spice but wish it was caramel instead, the way we do it in Venezuela & Spain. Was impossible to get a reservation for Sat night, but was able to get one same day Sunday.

Third, the food wasn't quite what I was expecting. It was average... Nothing spectacular. The Cacio e Pepe Arancini are definetly NOT worth it. They had a strong lemon flavor instead of a cheesy flavor... The Sticky Rice Dumplings are good, nothing amazing. I think the best that we had were the Crispy Bao Buns.

The art alone is something to drool over. First of all... how GENIUS! The decor in this place was put together with some of the best street art, combined with the Beauty and Essex touch, a touch of the LES street vibe, and the upper echelon vibe of the ""scene""... I mean... WOW! Well done to say the least. The booths in the back are set up half-moon style so that you can literally just sit and look out into the crowd and take in the art, people, fashion and energy of this amazingly designed establishment. Looking around the room you will see dudes wearing chuck taylors and blazers, ladies wearing stilettos and joggers or tight dresses. Casual chic, dressy, ... All is fair and perfect in fashion here. Music is pretty amazing for a dinner spot. They were playing a mix of good hip hop, chill funk, indie alternative, and a few (disappointing) radio hits... but overall music was pretty good for a dinner spot.  Volume was loud enough to want to dance around in your seat but low enough to chat with your crew without shouting. About the service. I don't think I have had better (and cooler) service any where else. The waitstaff was on point, educated, chill, but right on top of any anticipated need. Impeccable service. The menu items were creative and well thought out however in my opinion, most were not executed all that well. I was somewhat disappointed with the dinner items. What we had: OCTOPUS (small plate) - Pretty delicious, my favorite dinner item.RED SNAPPER TOSTADAS - Decently executed. Not my favorite but my friend really enjoyed these. BLACKENED SHRIMP AREPAS - A whole lot of ""blackened""... A bit too much if you ask me.TWO POUND WHOLE LOBSTER SCAMPI -  De-shelled but served in shell. Tender but smothered in way too much sauce.CRISP + CREAMY POTATOES - Medium sized cubes and are cooked well, pretty simple - nothing fancy here -  but well cooked.BRUSSELS ELOTE - I was disappointed with these. The sauce they have on these was drowning the actual brussels sprout. The taste was something like a balsamic with a twist. :/VANDAL S'MORES - Amazing and I will definitely be back just for this!!

We tried 8 different dishes - here is the rundown on some: Knish - best thing we tried. Little bite size knish stuffed with beef. Chicken mole taquitos - second best thing we tried. Mole was yummy and chicken was tender. Blackened shrimp - disgustingly salty. The salty shrimp sits on top of a corn cake which was mushy. Should have sent it back. Cesar pizza - I like thin crust crispy pizza, but this tasted burnt. The fried chicken skins didn't taste like anything (how can you mess that up), lacked cheese and the green sauce they drizzle on top (which tasted like cilantro) overpowered everything. Chicken katsu with Hong Kong waffles - the entire dish tasted like cardboard; very dry. For $28 - I wanted taste. Vandal smores - soooo good. I wanted to order a second serving, but just wanted to leave. Lastly, cocktail menu was seriously boring and uninspired. Decor was sterile and contrived.

I prefer intimate to Vegas big... to me it (tao and the like) just do not feel like NYC so I was wary of Vandal.  I do have to say it has a different feeling... They layout makes each room feel grand but not enormous. You are not sucked up into  a vapid space so for me it works! The night did not start too great.  We had a 915 res and they did not seat us until 945... I thought that it would have been smart/nice/right of them to get us a round or at least dessert.  The excuse that we are busy annoyed me (in fairness to them, a lot does). Know how to work your reservations better, this is not your first foodeo!  Anyway... Once we were seated the service was excellent. Our waiter knew the menu back and forth and the wine list (which was pretty solid).  I have no clue how to categorize the menu... It's a bit of everything and taken from different cultures or literally the greatest hits of many trendy fooddie stuff going on now (ramen, tacos, buns, pizza)+. Usually I think that idea blows but the food is really good. Some hits to me were the bao buns (these are amazing and i could just eat those!), Thai Papaya salad (and i dont like papaya, but this was dope and refreshing), Steak tarare (spelling?) pretzel (very good not amazing), tacos al pastor, and the Skirt Steak was awesome.  We ordered a lot of food for three people and had a pizza also which someone had recommended to me and said ""It might be one of the best pizzas i have had in nyc""... It was fine, but if you say that again friend i will have you institutionalized.  A big miss to me was the CHICKEN KATSU + HONG KONG EGG WAFFLES.  Uninspired chicken breast fried over soggy waffles... woof. Overall the food is very good, nice vibe, a bit of midtown comes to downtown and interesting/fun decor but original artists.

The hostess was very pleasant and sat us immediately. We were taken through another door to the secret garden. Very nice dining room. The waiter was super nice and accomodating. He gave us the run down of the tapas style dining. I am familiar with the style since I have been to Chris Santos' other restaurants, Stanton Social and Beauty & Essex. I was so excited. I by passed the cocktail menu and just ordered a combo of cranberry and pineapple juice. Very refreshing. My friend ordered the same. The menu is vast. We decided to pick one from each menu, the small, medium and large. We ordered the knish reuben, the grilled chilean sea bass tacos, and the jerk spiced salmon with quinoa. The small and medium order comes with only 3 items, so the waiter offered the option of making it 4 items per order. We definitely went for that. Omg was the food so flavorful and delicious. I was blown away nodding in delight at every bite. My friend also concured and thought the food was delicious. The knish reuben with oh so yummy with the corned beef and flaky crust. The grilled chilean sea bass tacos were out of this world. Absolutely amazing. The sea bass was the perfect size for the taco and the slaw on top gave it a nice touch of spice and crunch. Hands down it was my favorite of the night. Outstanding taco. Hmmmm. The jerk spiced salmon with quinoa was delish. It was just the right amount of heat and the salmon was cooked to perfection. I love quinoa so it was definitely a plus. We were content but my friend didn't want to stop there. He decided to order one last thing: blackened shrimp arepas. The shrimp was cooked perfectly and the arepa was so crispy and seasoned well. It was very good and delish. After that last dish, we were full and just asked for the check. We didn't want to even check the dessert menu. The staff was super friendly, very attentive and prompt. The tapas and entree were delivered hot and quickly. Vandals was definitely my favorite restaurant among the 3. Chris Santos' serves amazing food in his restaurants and this is no exception. The experience was amazing and the background music added to the ambiance. The diversity in the types of dishes was awesome and allowed you to take a journey around the world without leaving your table. I am definitely coming back again and again. It was that great. Its been open less than a month and it is exceptional. Definitely check out Vandals. Just remember to make an rsvp weeks if possible a month in advance.",11,7,7,Amy C.,"Flushing, NY",135,308,2008
3.0,2/10/2016,"Vandal was a good, fun experience with tasty food. Our very attentive (albeit maybe even a bit annoying) was the very reason I've knocked down one star. I'll get to that later. Drinks:Their specialty cocktails were good, as was the wine list. However, I ordered a bourbon manhattan that was subpar to say the least. My guess is the bartenders are trained in making their specialty drinks only. I was not thrilled with my go-to concoction. Food:The food was very good, but at the end we all collectively agreed there was something left to be desired. 4 stars (out of 5) for food. Some highlights: Tartare on the pretzel, knish, tuna crudo, grilled avocado salad & octopus.  Service:This is where Vandal loses a star. Our waiter, in my opinion, tried a bit too hard. Which is fine. However it was such an act. He yelled at the bus boys in front of us, not once but twice. Their crime? Putting plates on our table when we were done eating! ""I TOLD YOU THEY WERE DONE AND TO MOVE THE PLATES"" I much rather have plates on the table than witness some shit head be rude to his bus boys for such a trivial manner. All of us agreed that we did not care for his mistreatment of the staff. Other than that, our experience was quite enjoyable. We enjoyed one more cocktail from the lounge downstairs before retiring to our ubers & bed.",2,0,0,Grace N.,"New York, NY",1,120,4
4.0,2/10/2016,"The ambiance of this place is unbeatable. Gorgeous set up with a super hot crowd - and I went on a Monday night. I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised at how sweet the hostesses were because you typically walk into a place like this (i.e. catch, Stanton social) and the women at the front are awful snobs. Not here! Genuine smiles and you actually feel welcomed. It immediately sets the mood for the night. The food was fabulous. We dropped $500 because we couldn't stop ordering. The fish tacos - amazing. The beets - incredible. The octopus tostadas - holy shit. The pizza - out of this world. I was expecting a complete tourist trap but I got the exact opposite out of Vandal. Yes, it's incredibly expensive but the level of service and ambiance easily justified the cost.",0,0,0,Daniela S.,"Bergen County, NJ",0,86,14

Not only were the cocktails delicious, but we ended up ordering food as well and that was even better. The decor to the entire place is beautiful, all rooms were iconic street art and urban.

1.0,2/8/2016,"I haven't Yelped in a bit because life is super busy with a demanding job and crazy toddler who sucks up my free time. But I dusted off my Yelp gloves for this one because I need to shake this annoyed feeling I've been having since Saturday night. I am a big fan of Chris Santos. Used to be a regular at Stanton Social and frequented Beauty & Essex for years before it got a little too B&T for my taste. Was excited to hear he was opening a new place and so, after waiting a couple of weeks for them to work out the inevitable grand-opening kinks, my friends and I made a reservation for this past Saturday night at 10:45. I lined up a babysitter, and we decided to meet there at 9:45, figuring we'd explore the restaurant and everyone could have a few drinks at the bar while we waited for our table (except me, as I'm currently pregnant). Anyway, we walk in, the hostess hands us a little buzzer for when the table is ready, and we somehow manage to get through the throngs of others waiting to make our way to the bar. It was packed, like shoulder-to-shoulder packed, which I guess shouldnt be a surprise for a restaurant with this much hype. It was literally impossible to get within a 10 foot radius of the bar to order a drink. People were shoving each other, and those who had managed to order their drinks were not moving because there was nowhere else to go. I must have changed locations like 8 times and every single time after 2 minutes an employee would come by to tell me ""you can't stand here"". Well, OK, but where CAN I stand because I'm pregnant and starving and cant even order a freaking glass of water because of how packed it is. This goes on for an hour, and the time of our reservation approaches. My husband went to ask the hostess if she thought we'd be seated soon, and she said ""we're doing our best, maybe 10 minutes"". Fine, totally understandable, figured we would be seated by 11pm. Some more moving around the restaurant being told I was standing in the wrong place. Took a few photos in the little GIF photobooth they had (which is a nice touch). 11:45pm rolls around. Everyone in our party is HANGRY. My legs are SO tired, I'm contemplating ordering a pizza via seamless to the entrance of the restaurant. We head back to ask the hostess how much longer it will be, reminding her that I'm pregnant and we've been standing around for TWO hours. She apologetically says they are just now seating their 10:15 reservations, so it will be at least another 30 minutes but probably more. At that point, we all just looked at each other and collectively said ""F*ck this"" and walked out, went to a restaurant a few blocks away and finally got to sit down and feed our poor souls. Just wanted to post a warning for those who read the other reviews here because none of them mention the wait and judging by the hundreds of people who were waiting for their tables, this can't be an isolated problem. Chris Santos, I love your food but please have Vandal's management get their shit together so I can actually try it!",11,4,3,Yasmin Z.,"New York, NY",103,36,2
5.0,2/8/2016,"PERFECTION! Incredibly 5++++ stars all around. I am extremely visual and this is probably thee most visually amazing place I've seen in the city or anywhere ever - with way over the top coolness... Street art inspired with gorgeously cool paintings, wall etchings, gorgeous artwork and creativity; such fantastic impressive talent behind the design of this new speakeasy/ restaurant/ bar.  And it is huge! In several rooms, down hallways, even the bathrooms were beautifully and impressively decorated with unique Eye candy perfection.. Around every corner there were impressive decorations, paintings and details.(Narrowing down to 15 ish pictures to post was a challenge.)Service. Incredible, friendly, attentive bartender service, and with excellent drink making skills; uniquely flavored drinks and the mixologist was able to develop a perfect creation when my friend asked for a modification of one of the drink specials based on her preferences.Drinks. Amazingly good, uniquely flavored.  I had a perfect Mezcel drink from their specialty drink menu, Las palmitos, and my friend had another beautifully presented drink, both fantastic. My friend ordered a sweeter variation on my Mezcel drink and it was perfectly made.Food.  The small dishes were wonderfully presented, food equally creative keeping with the street food inspired theme of the restaurant, but street food taken to a new higher/ upscale  level...and delicious ! What we had:- Grilled Chilean sea bass tacos... Fantastic. Cooked and flavored perfectly with corn, tomatoes and a flavorful sauce atop a light crispy ""taco type"" cracker - Blackened shrimp arepas- amazing. Chili spice flavor with beautiful purple slaw. More eye candy and fabulous.- Knish Reuben. Mmm. A different interesting take on Reuben in a puff pastry. A little more sauce would have been my preference but still great.Flower shop / speakeasy... The restaurant is behind the door in beautiful and elegant flower shop with amazing, stunning creative flower displays that are actually sold. Upon leaving I took a card and let them know my future boyfriend would be calling them ... Ha LOVED everything about Vandal and highly recommend for friends or a date. A must experience!

Must try beef tartar pretzel, ceviche, sea bass tacos and snapper tostadas and fried buns. Last course was skirt steak with fried rice. Steak was cooked to perfection and rice was amazing but wasn't loving the two together. Also had juicy Lucy which was amazing and Caesar pizza which was also fantastic! Rest of my group had chicken and waffles and they didn't love the soy waffles but said the chicken was great.Drinks: Amazing, $15-16 each but strong and tasty so totally worth it.Tried Pushcart, loved it!BONUS: Got to meet Chris Santos.

2.0,2/6/2016,"This place was formerly known as boulevard (Blvd) after which it was the General. It has been redone nicely, with a warm contemporary look, and some street art on the walls. It looks pretty fabulous.However, many of the establishments owned by the Tao group look fabulous. They tend to fall short on food however, and at Vandal the food really falls short. The sea bass tacos are flavorless. The jicama tacos were the only interesting appetizer we tried, they had a nice flavor and were one of the healthier items on the menu. The pretzel with steak tartare was more of a novelty than anything that could be considered good food. We had a mushroom pizza. This was, perhaps, the best items of the night. The pizza had a lot of flavor and the crust, made of semolina I think, held everything together well. But this is NY, and there are many places in the city that offer excellent pizza. The skirt steak was mediocre, and the fried rice that accompanied it lacked a kick. Same applies to the fried eggplant side (which could have used a dose Szechwan peppercorns). Perhaps food was intentionally meant to be kept as a novelty here, because for some reason the chef (Chris Santos) hold back from really letting the food shine. Vandal aims to bring a Tao like experience to a part of the city that, at least historically, was more gritty. Instead, as many of the photos you see probably indicate, it turns out to be the Cheesecake Factory of Manhattan.

4.0,2/6/2016,"Food: 3Ambiance: 5++Service: 5The owners of Beauty & Essex and Stanton Social (TAO Group) have created yet another trendy hot spot.  This speakeasy restaurant/bar/lounge is gorgeous like all their other ventures, but with a more contemporary street art spin.  The food is pretty lackluster, but I'm rating this place 4 stars overall because the decor, ambiance and service made up for it.The restaurant itself is a speakeasy, fronted by a beautiful flower shop, outfitted by the florist Ovando.  (The flowers are actually available for sale.)  There are several dining rooms, all adorned with beautiful art.  The smaller dining room is located near the front.  The larger dining rooms are in the back.  There are two sets of bathrooms.  One of them is located at the back, so you can view the other rooms on your way there.The food isn't that good.  I don't know where the other reviewers have been dining thus far to make them think it was outstanding.  Maybe they were so mesmerized by the place that their taste buds experienced amnesia.  I totally agree with Mike C.: The lengthy menu lacks focus and tasty dishes.  We ordered 3 Small dishes and 1 Medium dish:-Knish Reuben: Boring.  Nice texture, but very bland in flavor. 3 pieces.-Sticky Rice Dumplings: Ditto the above, even with the duck sauce. 5 pieces.-Bacon and Miso Ramen: Meh.  Pass.-""Bahn Mi"": These were delicious!!  Finally, a winner.  4 very tasty, cute little sliders.  Yum!So most of the food was boring, but the service was fantastic!  Our servers were very welcoming and happy to explain the menu.  Everything was plated and presented so beautifully.  Don't forget to head downstairs to check out the speakeasy lounge!!  It's equally luxe, spacious, pretty, and outfitted with lots of booths and tufted sofas.  Also pretty chill during the early evening.  It's located right next to the bathrooms.  The door blends into the wall, with only the metal handle as the giveaway.  We came early, so we were able to walk right in, but according to the hostess, it's generally entry by reservation only after 10 PM.  (I think the bar/lounge reservations may be separate from the restaurant reservations.)  Unlike Beauty & Essex, Vandal wasn't crowded, it's less clubby, and there was plenty of seating available.  But it could be because the night was still young, and this restaurant/lounge only opened a few weeks ago...Despite the so-so food, I'd still return because there's the speakeasy lounge downstairs, so you don't have to dine here...  And every other factor was great!!!  Plus, there are SO many other dishes (on their looooong, scattered menu) that just might be delicious.  There are also very few equally awesome spots in this area, so it's truly a neighborhood gem.  Totally worth checking out at least once.  Definitely a good place to take out-of-towners to if you aren't near bigger, fancier spots like Buddakan, Spice Market, Beauty & Essex, etc.",0,0,0,Cece Y.,"San Francisco, CA",2,731,873

But I was SO utterly mistaken. All of the food I had was out of the park. For 3 girls, we had the SALAD SHWARMA, the CHICKEN KATSU + HONG KONG EGG WAFFLES, and the STICKY RICE CAKES and I must say...everything was absolutey delicious. We thought we were ordering light on food and were hoping to order more, but we were all very full by the end of the meal (we had a drink each).The service was very attentive and they are very knowledgeable about the food. They just opened this past weekend so I know that the hype will build over the next couple of weeks. The owners are the same restauranteurs that do Tao and Beauty&Essex so I'm sure they will make this a new, trendy hot spot.I'm also a huge fan of street art and the interior is stunning. Pieces from street artists like Apex, Triston Eaton, JR, and Shepard Fairey are up and the servers were saying that they were painting the walls for a month prior to the opening of the restaurant. So in other words the restaurant is very ""photogenic"" and its a great spot to take your next Instagram photo. It will have all your friends fooled that you're hip & trendy :) But, they do take reservations so I recommend to call ahead as I can TOTALLY see this place living up to its hype and getting very busy, very soon.

3.0,1/16/2016,"If you can't decide if you're in the mood for Souvlaki or Pan Con Tomate or Tostadas or Korean Rice Cakes or Cacio e Pepe Arancini or Chicken Mole or Peruvian Ceviche or Miso Ramen or New York Style Pretzels or Red Snapper Tostadas or Tacos Al Pastor or Banh-Mi or Singapore Crab Claws or Za'atar Bread or Thai Papaya Salad or Knish Reuben or a Juicy Lucy or Shawarma Salad or Cauliflower Samosas or Argentinian Beef Empanadas or Sticky Rice Dumplings or Shrimp Arepas or Crispy Bao Buns or Pizza or Chicken Katsu and Hong Kong Egg Waffles or Skirt Steak or Kati Rolls or Paella or Lobster Fra Diavolo, then this is the place for you.Understandably, with a menu containing such an insanely wide array of different flavors and styles of food, most of the stuff is very hit or miss. Some is actually quite good though, which is what you would hope to expect from Chris Santos, one of the judges from Chopped and the owner of Beauty & Essex, which has a similar clubby vibe but pulls off the wacky dishes much better.When you enter, you walk into a fake Florist Shop, much like the fake Pawn Shop at the front of Beauty & Essex. Walk through a door in the back wall to enter the giant restaurant space, with several rooms split over two levels. At the early bird special hour when we arrived around 5:30, there were about twenty times as many employees on the floor as there were guests (even though they insisted on the phone that they were booked solid, none of the booths in the room we were in were occupied even by the time we left at around 8 PM).Service was very friendly, offering up some suggestions from the sprawling menu, which was helpful in a way since there was so much stuff to choose from. We tried to sample a bunch of different cuisines while trying not to spend enough to really really hate ourselves, but she said 6-8 dishes would be reasonable:- Cacio e Pepe Arancini ($15 for 6)These were very tasty. Not a terrible value considering you get 6 of the crispy rice balls.- Bacon and Miso Ramen ($9)This was one of the worst bites by far. The noodles were all balled up into a single salty clump that really made it seem like they microwaved a ""Cup Of Noodles"" and poured it into the little bowl and threw some pork on top of it. I should probably be ashamed for thinking of ordering ramen at a place like this, but just in case you get any ideas, definitely skip this one.- Knish Reuben ($13 for 3)And this was one of the best bites. These were mini knishes filled with corned beef, sauerkraut and swiss cheese, sitting on top of thousand island dressing. This is an example of a great hybrid food from the menu that actually worked really well.- Heaven Spot Burger ($13)Billed on the menu as a ""juicy lucy style"" burger, there was hardly any cheese contained in the very thin, almost raw patty. This was a major letdown too, as some of the photos I've seen of this one looked much better.- Crispy Bao Buns ($18 for 3)This was another excellent choice. Instead of the traditional fluffy white bao buns, these were (I guess) fried, resulting in a browned, crispier bun. The filling was excellent too, with a deliciously juicy brisket that was a nice change from the typical fatty pork belly.- Tomato San Marzano Pizza ($18)This was just ok. Obviously not a place for a really stellar pizza, but it wasn't bad either. Probably not worth $18 though.- Chicken Katsu & Hong Kong Egg Waffles ($32)Based on the experience of this entree, I would say skip the ""Large"" section and get two of the smaller items from the earlier sections. The chicken katsu in this dish was decent enough, but the egg waffles were hard, dry and flavorless. This one was an expensive bad decision.- Macaron Creamsicle Ice Cream Sandwich ($7)Similar to the regular menu, the dessert menu has tons of varying choices (8 different items to pick from). This one was an oversized macaron with some ice cream sandwiched in the middle, which was too soft and melty, resulting in a mess after the first bite.- Vandal S'mores ($13)One of the less exciting of the ubiquitous interpretations of s'mores around the city lately, this one was just ok, with a chocolate tart topped with marshmallow and a scoop of graham cracker ice cream. The ice cream was the best part.- Black + White Crepe Cake ($15)I was disappointed to see this was almost identical in presentation to the s'mores. Similarly, the ice cream with this one was also better than the main component, the crepe cake, which looked nicer than it tasted.If you go and order exactly the right stuff and don't make the same mistakes, and can either enjoy watching, or you yourself like to take selfies with your girlfriends throughout an entire meal, this is easily at least a 4 star spot. I feel like if they just trimmed some fat from the menu and got a little more focused on some of the better dishes, it would definitely be worth a visit.",58,22,19,Mike C.,"Forest Hills, NY",5000,1694,69834
5.0,1/16/2016,"Opening night review! Saturday, January 16th, was the first night the restaurant was open to the public. There were some opening night hiccups, as could be expected with the order system as well as the billing system. I'll give them a pass on these issues all things considered. If you've beer been to The General, which is the restaurant that formerly occupied this space, you will recognize essentially nothing from the old occupant aside from the windows out front. The place has a slightly better lit feel than Beauty and Essex and still maintains that sexy feel without the feel or a place that requires a velvet rope. So the real reason we are here: the food. The story is Chef Chris Santos travelled the world eating street food in search of inspiration. What I'll say is if you are a world traveller, some of these flavors will take you back. If you are not, and just someone who enjoys delicious food, you'll be ok too. Pressed New York Hot Pretzel - interesting way to start the meal. What you get here is a New York style pretzel that is pressed flat, topped with a beef tartar in a smoked aioli and mustard seeds, on top of a creamy mustard base.  When you eat this,everything about the flavors scream street cart pretzel. The beef tartar is an appropriate accompaniment, which is a strange statement, but it works. Cacio e Pepe Arancini - first bite, you will be met with an unexpected flavor: lemon. The crust is laced with lemon zest, with the acid cutting through the richness of the arancini. It's a tasty dish and the lemon zest is what makes it different from every other arancini you've had. Crispy Bao Buns - ever been to dim sum brunch in Hong Kong (or Chinatown)? This will remind you of everything you loved about it. The rice bun is gluttonous and crispy, filled with sweet, tender meat. Excellent.  Sea Bass Tacos - it's as good as you expect. Most sea bass, flavorful crema, and salsa in a corn tortilla. It hits the spot and is everything you want it to be. Red Snapper Tostada - don't let the size of this in pictures scare you. Each tiny tostada has easily 3-4 ounces of delicious red snapper on it, and it's excellent. Beef Empanadas -this is what I would call the only weak spot of the meal. The empanada dough and filling both stemmed a bit dry. The accompanying salsa and crema were both tasty, but this one needs some tweaking. Heaven Spot Burger - if a juicy Lucy and a Big Mac had a illegitimate love child, this is what you will get. The inside of the burger is filled with molten cheese, and the sauce is straight up special sauce you find in a Big Mac. If you secretly like Big Macs, you will love this. Knish Reuben - this one is harder to describe. Here's what I'll say. If you like knishes and you like reubens, you will love this. It's basically a mini knish filled with brisket and a homemade thousand island dressing. And no meal would be complete without a few beverages. So those...Trigger Finger - excellent drink. Extra points for being served in its own bottle, which you are encouraged to steal. Smoking Gun - this one is finished with a super peaty scotch, so if you like Lagavulin or other super peaty scotches, you will like this. To put it as simply as I can, you need to go here. Chef Santos really executed his vision perfectly here in recreating local classics. The food here is a step above both Stanton Social and Beauty and Essex. One of the best meals I've had here in a long time. Absolutely recommended.",10,1,8,Dave F.,"Hoboken, NJ",429,633,1392
4.0,1/15/2016,"Stopped in here last night for the opening of Chris Santos's (of Chopped and Beauty and Essex Fame) newest venture. The art, from street artists such as Shepard Fairey, was so new that you could still smell the spray paint upstairs. Luckily, the opening event was being held downstairs, in a fume-free environment. I didn't quite see the supposed street art/street food connection that the waiter was talking about, but there were definitely some tasty bites among the limited menu of shareable plates that was available. The white pizza was a bit salty from the nduja sausage, I think, but the crust was delightfully thin and crisp, and I liked the unique crunch of the hazelnuts, which was a fun topping. The juicy lucy ""heaven spot burger"" was kind of a strange item to share, but it was perfectly cooked, oozing with housemade American cheese, The nduja-stuffed fried olives were just okay, but the cacio e pepe arancini were great, and came with an amazingly creamy ""parmesan espuma"" dipping sauce that I definitely wanted more of. Drinks took forever, but the waitress was quite apologetic. I had the Lost and Found: gin, aperol, sage simple syrup, lemon, currant tea, and angostura bitters with a thyme garnish. It was dark in the restaurant and the type was really small, so I didn't realize it was a tea-based cocktail until after I ordered, which was probably why I didn't love it. The vibe was definitely reminiscent of Beauty & Essex. There were some ridiculous girls in the bathroom squealing about how they ""couldn't wait to party here."" Gag. I want to spend more time in the main space upstairs though. There are seven giant murals, and a really cool giant upside-down bunny sculpture.",31,15,26,Sarah C.,"New York, NY",152,352,60
