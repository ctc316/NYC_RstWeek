Sever service is very slow I asked for no ice water which I got , but when come to refil the water on our table he pour the ice water on my glass which I did not want . The food was average I didn't enjoy the lobster  Mac and cheese . But the lamb was good, the drinks was good.

4.0,4/28/2019,"Love this place! I always go to their Happy Hour!! 3:30-6:30pm during the week and on Sundays! Of you get there after 5:30pm late in the week, it can be pretty hard to find a seat/table in the lounge during Happy Hour. But I've only had to leave once because I couldn't get a table and I've been going at different times for about 5 years now. It's worth a go.  My favorite waitress is Tai (Sp?). She always takes care of me. When my mom died 2 years ago, I was so down and went there to get a drink and a little normalcy. Tai and the manager at the time, took care of my entire bill because I was kind of a regular. I go about 10 times a year... sometimes more or less. Their happy hour prices went up to about $9 but it's still totally worth it for cute hang with a friend.",0,0,0,Soara-Joye R.,"Bricktown, Detroit, MI",6,16,10

1.0,4/8/2019,"I was craving a good filet and Ruth's Chris was just a few blocks from my hotel (as were a lot of other steakhouses) so I went in for dinner. It was a slower Monday night and I sat at the bar. There was myself, one man by himself, a lady by herself, a couple who had closed out and were finishing their drinks to leave, a one other man by himself. When I first sat down the bartender asked what I would like to drink and I got ""a water for now and I'll have a cocktail in a minute"" while I decided what to get. He asked if I wanted a dinner menu which I of course said yes to and he handed it to me and gave me a water. A few minutes (2-3) go by while I look at the menu before I close it and sit back. A few more minutes go by and we make eye contact as I give him the ""I'm ready to order"" look. Nada. At this point I decide to just see how long it would take him to come over there and I started the stopwatch on my phone. Again, this was a very slow night and there were only a few other bar customers, not to mention a second bartender, but yet service seemed to be nonexistent. 5 1/2 minutes go by and he STILL did not come back. At this point I got irritated and hangry and decided that I wasn't just going to sit around and wait on the guy or have to convince him to provide a service, so I got up and left. Start to finish was around 11 minutes of me sitting there waiting to order on a very slow night. For all of the great steakhouses in the area, I would expect RC's service to be better than that.",0,0,0,John P.,"Katy, TX",0,6,3

2.0,4/1/2019,"Ruth's Chris has always been one of my favorites steakhouses but tonight I had such a bad experience that I had to write about it. We were a party of 8 working individuals on a Monday night so the place is not packed. One of the individuals from my party got tied up with at work and was running 20 min late. She texted me her order and asked us to order for her and she would join us as soon as she could. The rest of the party was there. Ruth's Chris refused to seat us until we were all there which is ridiculous!! In NYC where folks get tied up at work, how can you make everyone wait for one last person? My entire party was pissed waiting and of course, the late individual felt so bad, she tried to back out of the dinner so that everyone didn't have to wait for her. I know other restaurants have the policy of not seating until everyone in the party arrives which I can understand during peak times when there are no tables but not on a Monday night when there are empty tables and someone is just running late from work. I'm disappointed in Ruths Chris not being more flexible and considerate. I will not be counting Ruth's Chris as one of my favorite steakhouses anymore.

5.0,3/21/2019,"This place never disappoints.  My family and I have been to several of their locations, and the food is always top notch!Id really like to give this place 4 stars, but their food really makes up for the small problems that we had.We came here recently after a family event in the city.  We had a 530 reservation, but our prior event ended way earlier than expected so we tried to go at 430, and they said sure no problem!  We got there 420 and they had us wait on the side until 510...  When they sat us, 70% of the tables were empty.  I am not sure why it took so long to get us seated, but oh well!  We usually do not have this issue, so I chalk it up to bad luck.A few of us ordered drinks that were all delicious!  My brother ordered a Hendricks neat, but got a gin a tonic instead.  When he asked about it, our waiter said keep it and he will get him another.  The other never came...  My waiter also asked me twice about wanting a rare ribeye.  He first told me rare is cooked outside, reddish purple on the inside.  I said that I knew, then he proceeded to ask again if I was sure.  I felt like a contestant on millionaire!  HA!  The only other problem that we experienced might just have been inside my head!  When I went to the Westchester location about 8 years ago, they had the best Brussel sprouts that I ever had in my life!  This time, they were ok, nothing super special...On to the good stuff!Some of my family ordered from the prix fixe menu, some of us ordered from the regular menu.  I am not going to go through all the dishes that we ordered, but everything other than the sprouts were outstanding!   All our food was cooked perfectly to our liking.  I secretly slipped an extra spoonful or 3 of butter onto my plate as it came in and I was in heaven with my ribeye!  My only slight complaint would be the lobster bisque needed a little more lobster...I really wanted to get the tomahawk ribeye which is killer, but my family is a little judgy when it comes to really ordering expensive items lol!  I was happy with my regular ribeye.  When the wife and I go to Ruth's I can get my tomahawk lol!Most of my family had desserts included with their meals and they all enjoyed them.The décor is very dark.  It could really be 1 or 2 notches higher and people wont notice the difference.  I know they try to keep an old steakhouse vibe, but 1 or 2 notches...All in all, a consistently great place.  Same great service and food every time that we go.  My family and I have been to about 7 or 8 of their locations across the country.",0,0,0,James A.,"Montauk, NY",254,126,7

Knowing my wife would stick with standard filet and shrimp and shoestring fries, and that she would generously share with me,  I branched our and tried the blackened coconut snapper. It was amazing. I LOVE fish hot of the grill or oven, and this was served on the same hot plate, so it kept the temperature hot. AWESOME.

2.0,3/5/2019,"Extremely disappointed with the experience at this steakhouse. I've been to Ruth's Chris in other cities and have generally enjoyed the experience. This location, however, is basically an over-priced Chili's. First, they barely gave us any time to enjoy our cocktails and asked twice if we were ready to order while we still had the menus open. The appetizers came out with the sides so when our steaks arrived just a few minutes later there was no room on the table. Thankfully (?) they had put sauce on the wrong steak so the first attempt was sent back. I figured that would buy us another 10 minutes while they cooked two new steaks but nope. They immediately returned with the correct order, noting that they ""have lots of steaks coming out all the time."" Hmm...maybe so, but having a conveyor belt of beef is not exactly what you want in a ""high-end"" steakhouse. The medium-rare steak I ordered came off the assembly line fully medium, not pink or bloody in the middle at all. If I was paying Chili's prices, I would shrug it off, but at $45 a pop I say save your money and go to any of the dozen other, better options in the city. Add in the fact that people were standing/kneeling on the furniture (!) to hit them angles and it all adds up to a very déclassé one-star dining experience.

Steak was done well.That's the only good thing I can say about this place.The service was not good at all. I think we spent more time on waiting than more on eating.We waited 15 mins before the waiter came to take our order.Another 10-15 mins to ask for our drinks, and then fork and then a knife. Never bother to check if we had a knife when bringing over the steak.We had our dinner, and wanted to ask for our check.Well, he did bring the check over, but never came back after that. We had to ask busboy because no one else was available. We then waited over 20 mins to get the receipt to sign back. Yes, 20 mins. We chose this place to celebrate a birthday after reviewing great reviews. It turned out to be disappointing celebrating.Staff never even did anything for birthday friend after sprinkling confetti on table when seated. Probably will not recommend to friends.",1,0,0,Ayumi N.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",1,36,75
4.0,2/18/2019,Went here for a belated Valentine's day dinner after seeing King Kong on Broadway. The food and ambiance here is soooooo good!!!! My wife loved it and says it's her best steakhouse experience ever! Only Del Frisco's can compete in her eyes. As for the menu we had steak of course. I had the 11oz bone in filet (medium) and she had the 4oz filet (medium-well) with Shrimp. We shared the blue lump crab appetizer which was phenomenal and shared an order of Lobster Mac/Cheese with our steaks!!! When we were being seated a hostess named Dee Dee sat us at a table very well lighted and set for 4 people but it's was only two of us dining and we found that a little strange. We asked to be moved to a more dimly lit area and a table for 2. Dee Dee apologized and gave us a table that made our experience that much more rewarding. Thanks Dee Dee :) I had two glasses of Pinot Noir that seemed to be the perfect pairing with the meat. She went with a Riesling which she enjoyed as she feasted of some of the best beef she ever tasted.

The buss boy was very polite and I thought doing a great job but was spoken to in an open setting several times by one of the waiters.

5.0,1/1/2019,Hands down the best steak and shrimp I've had! I didn't even need to use thee steak sauce I requested and the shrimps are huge and sooooo tender. I ordered the two four oz steaks and shrimp. When I asked our waiter how many shrimp comes with the meal he said four and I was pleasantly surprised. Then when our plates came there 6 shrimps with my dish!!! The service was prompt and our waiter was so patient. The hostess was so kind. Me and my boyfriend were literally almost 4 hours late to our reservation and they still managed to accommodate us. We will definitely be going back soon. Well worth the money spent.

3.0,12/24/2018,"I heard much better things from this location than the one in Long Island and so I booked reservations for my Fiance & I to celebrate our Anniversary. Here's the experience:Drinks: 2 white Sangria's. They tasted like mimosas-not so good and my orange was still green. Also, my cup came with a side of someone's lips so I requested a new glass. Steaks: How does a steakhouse run out of steak? It was only 6PM! So since there was no more porterhouse, we had to settle for a NY Strip (bone-in) & the Cowboy Ribeye (bone-in) both medium. The NY Strip tasted like it was seasoned with salt & pepper, extra pepper. Not a fan. The Cowboy Ribeye was better. Very tender and cut easily. Both of them were more medium-rare, but that was ok as we were starving anyway.Lobster mac & cheese: Ehh...I've had much better. They're not cheap with the lobster, but the flacor wasn't all that.Creamed Spinach: Also just ok. I prefer other places.OVERALL:  Disappointing given the recommendations. At the end, our server gave us a complimentary little dessert (seems like a regular thing as the table next to us had the same presentation). I threw out my receipt but I wish I hadn't so I could remember his name. He was attentive & knowledgeable but the food was just average in my opinion. Honestly not sure if I'd travel to return here.

The food - 11 ounce fillets, mashed potatoes, root vegetables (very good), cheesecake and ice cream - was okay, but for $100 per person I would expect better.

We made sure to ask before we ordered to avoid making it confusing at the end. I understand it can be an inconvenience and maybe looked down upon. however,  we decided it would be easier just to get separate checks.

5.0,11/18/2018,Asked a couple of people what was a nice restaurant to take my significant other to to celebrate his birthday? Several people mentioned this place. So I made reservations and took my man for his birthday. When we walked in we were greeted by a really nice host and then asked for our names. The inside of the restaurant is beautiful and well kept. Soft music playing created a really romantic atmosphere. I ordered two petite steak with grilled shrimp on top and garlic mash potato. My Man had ordered one of the big steaks that's 24oz with au gratin..we had two cups of red wine can't remember the exact name it was a suggestion from our waiter And it was a good one! We had 3 cups each! I asked for my steak medium well but when I cut my steak a little blood spilled out which scared me because I normally get my steak cooked well done. I called the waiter over and expressed my feelings and he quickly took my steak and returned it back well done. Only thing that sucked is that I ate 4 out the 6 jumbo shrimp that came on top of my steak. But to my surprise there were 4 more fresh shrimp  on top of the steak which was compliments of the waiter because he didn't want my 1st experience to be bad. I thought that was extremely nice and very hospitable of him. My mash potatoes taste like they were made with milk instead of heavy cream. It was kind of loose if u know what I mean. However when I taste my significant others au gratin it was to die for! So cheesy hot and the potatoes cooked just right! I have a new favorite!

About the third time the party and I were ready to go to our Broadway show. They did not comp the steak and it took a manager almost 30 minutes just to come to the table.

I had to call and then I was greeted by someone who kept repeating that they are closed and I had to remind her that I had a reservation.

When my husband inquired why the door was locked and what were we supposed to do to get in had we not been able to call we were again told by the hostess that they were closed. Since the regular except 1030 reservations they obviously were closing early that evening which is not my problem if you take a reservation you should honor it accordingly without attitude and without reservation.

Very flavorful! BBQ Shrimp (6 pcs): a bit bland and kinda boring to me. But the Shrimp comes in a good size, not too small for happy hour appetizers. Filet Sliders (3 pcs): the meat was bland and chewy. Doesn't appeal as filet mignon at all. Not to my liking! Ahi Tuna: another favorite from happy hour menu. Lightly seasoned, but perfect. We also had a filet mignon order from the Restaurant Week menu to share ($42). The entree came with: House Salad: average 8 oz cut Filet Mignon (cooked medium): the filet was a bit tough to chew and didn't have enough flavor. I had a better steak at Wolfgang's Steakhouse.

My colleague was in a dress shirt and slacks...Seriously?  As I am disputing this with the attendant, I see somebody wearing green shorts walking in the bar as well as a slovenly looking man wearing dirty sneakers and a sloppy unzipped sweatshirt coming out.  I point this out to them, and still get a clueless manager of sorts pointing at a dinky sign.  I point out the slovenly man, and despite his dirty sneakers and zipped sweatshirt, the attendant points out that he was indeed wearing blue jeans.  The BLATANT hypocrisy and obvious subjectivity implementing the dress code at Ruth Chris is truly a new low for a steak house I once deemed pretty good.  The fact that I made my point insistently and emphatically and they still escorted me out as if I'm some delinquent is totally repulsive and demeaning.  I will NEVER recommend this sad excuse for a steakhouse again to any of my colleagues or friends.  Having gone to every steakhouse in NYC, the title of worst customer service goes to Ruth Chris.  Go to Keens or The Palm - they are a class act.",0,0,0,Sam N.,"New York, NY",0,3,0

I am a big fan of the sizzling steaks and the cheesecake. The creamed spinach is a must every time I go. If you are looking for a nice experience and looking to be a bit more budget conscious I suggest looking into the happy hour. They have food options and drink specials from 4-6pm.

Then came the 12 oz ribeye - mouthwatering good. The dessert was similarly delicious. The only reason I'm knocking off a star is because I was quite unimpressed with the sides of mashed potatoes and creamed spinach.

I have never in my life asked for a replacement entree or a refund for a bad or inconsistent meal....(I'm one of those who will just suck it up and never return to a place I don't find to my liking) BUT in light of my overall frustration at that point, I did inform him that although I was going  to eat my meal anyway, the steak I ordered was not so good and very different from what I've experienced in the past at Ruth's Chris.  He just looked at me strangely so I said ""you asked"" and he walked away never once asking if I would like to order something else, like a different type of steak.   They did end up sending over complimentary desserts but I would have gone to Dairy Queen if I wanted to stock up on sweets....all I wanted was a really good steak meal with my daughters and tonight, Ruth's Chris and Jonathan fell flat....next time, I will go elsewhere.",0,0,0,Rita E.,"Manhattan, NY",0,7,0

It was is very modern and chic; especially for a steakhouse that is something you don't always find. It love that you can tell every detail was well thought out, I feel like it gives the space character .Food: Now if you have read my other steakhouse reviews , you'd know I love when a steakhouse has an exclusive dish, side or sauce. This steakhouse had the appetizers that were amazing. My two favorites that exclusive to them which where the spicy shrimp and calamari but we also had the ahi tuna.For the main course, I loved that they gave us hot plates because the meat was ordered rare and I got to cook it more. I like it cooked medium otherwise I find it to be too chewy. The steak was also served in a sizzling steak pan ; it was so juicy and had good flavor . I prefer my steak  herb pan seared or to have a touch of salt but I'll have to try and another steak to see what options they have ; we had the rib-eye with a side of mash, cream of spinach and broccoli but I have to go back to try the lobster mash!Service : the service was good but if you are ordering wine, there is a long wait, almost an awkwardly long wait we order four bottles and sometimes made it up to 10 minutes just to receive the other one.

3.0,4/2/2018,"Have been going to Ruth Chris Manhattan location on 51st street for years.  Yesterday, went their with my BFF for Easter dinner.  We requested and got our favorite booth in the Grill Room, which is quiet and cozy.The good news is that the food is fabulous and never disappoints and the wait staff is excellent.  Really enjoyed the Raspberry Rosemary Cosmos, house salads, the lamb chops--cooked to perfection--the fingerling potatoes and asparagus with Hollandaise sauce. Cosmos were ice cold and beautifully presented, and the main meal was piping hot and well-paced.The downside to this Ruth Chris is the clientele, and I have noticed this on the last several visits.  There are tons of tourists who are are there in slovenly jeans and dirty sneakers, lugging black plastic bags filled with the counterfeit merchandise they just ""scored"" in Times Square.  There are also gangs of young people wearing baseball caps on backwards, sweatpants with the crotch hanging down to their knees and over-sized bomber jackets.  Not to be snobby, but most of them look like they couldn't afford to eat at McDonald's, let alone at Ruth Chris.  While the restaurant has a dress code stating that this type of apparel is not appropriate, it is not enforced.  C'mon...this is a very expensive, white tablecloth restaurant, and I think people should dress up a bit...and sit up straight at the table! (Instead of pushing their chair out three feet and laying back in the chair, legs spread and hands in pocket.  You KNOW that look...!) Finally, last night by 6 pm, I used the lady's room and the waste basket was overflowing with the paper hand towels.  I observed several of the ""ladies"" simply throw their hand towel on the floor under the sink.  Another one exited the stall without flushing and then threw her hand towel into the toilet and still didn't flush.  This kind of behavior shows absolutely no respect for other guests or for a fine restaurant with a tradition of excellence.  Despite the great food, I will think twice about returning.  Our bill for two people (including a $50 tip) was just under $275.  For that kind of money, I expect both the food and the atmosphere to be top-notch.",0,0,0,Cheryl B.,"Manhattan, NY",0,30,0

Ended the meal with a port and creme brûlée.All good and well... service was awkwardly lacking. Our server kept crossing his arm in front of my face to fill my water glass (we had a central table so he could simply walk on my other side); same with my cousin. More than once. Really annoying and rude to be interrupted by someone who is supposed to discretely make sure you are comfortable throughout your night, and it disrupts a smooth dining experience.

But the food was the worst I've had in NYC in fact in a long time. We have a Ruth Chris in San Antonio as well but I never had a bad dish there. First of all I got served prosecco in a burgundy/red wine glass.  The fried calamari was very greasy and chewy. The mushrooms stuffed e crab meat was really good. The. I had the osobucco ravioli as an entree which was a disappointment because I was not only undercooked But also not flavorful and the sauce was too salty(and I love salt). The petite filet was probably the only good dish. The side dishes included bad potato al gratin, overbooked bitter Brussels sprouts with rancid bitter taste (bad smelly old oil?). Crimini mushrooms were too greasy as well but well seasoned. The only descent side dish was the roasted corn. Dessert and coffee was the only redeeming end to an expensive but not so happy ending. Definitely try the chocolate lava cake if you HAVE to eat here. But go somewhere else if you can.

5.0,2/9/2018,"I heard great things about this steakhouse and I decided to check it out for winter NYC Restaurant Week and my fiancé's birthday. We were seated in the library room just to the right of the entrance and was given great service by the host and our waiter. It was really cute thy decorated the table with Happy Birthday confetti. Our waiter, Frank, made sure that we were properly attended to and explained the menu clearly for us. We started out with red sangria which was sweet and fruity. Checking out the regular menu, if you plan to order steak as it is a steakhouse, the restaurant week menu gives you your money's worth since it's $42 for three courses. The petite filet on the restaurant week menu easily is $51 on the regular menu. We opted for the restaurant week menu as it gave the best bang for our buck. I decided to get the lobster bisque, petite filet and it comes with a NYC cheesecake with chocolate almond bark. The lobster bisque was creamy, but a hair on the salty side for my liking. The waiter and servers warn you that the plates for the steak come out hot and not to touch it. Wow they were not kidding. You can still hear and see the steak sizzling on the plates. The filet was the perfect portion of 8oz. The steak was cooked to a perfect medium and well seasoned with salt, parsley and pepper. For sides we choose the creamed spinach and garlic mashed potatoes that both went well with the steak. The dessert was the perfect sweet note to the night. The cheesecake was light and creamy and was a great contrast to the dark chocolate almond bark. They were nice enough to write Happy Birthday on my fiancé's plate and also have him a small scoop of vanilla ice cream. The location is pretty close to the subway and a couple of blocks away from Times Square, so you can easily grab a pre-theatre meal before the show.

1.0,1/31/2018,"In my 3 years of living in Manhattan, Ruth's Chris has been my worst dining experience ever. I enjoy trying out new restaurants, from quick casual to Michelin stars, so I thought maybe (JUST MAYBE) I had become a bit snobby.  Thankfully, my boyfriend (who is the most basic of all basics) was equally, if not more, appalled.  We both agreed it was, from start to end, just plain bad.We started out with a brusque hostess who didn't make any eye contact. Fine. I don't care that much. I mean, a warm greeting would have been nice, but I was there for the food. We were seated - and just so you know, it wasn't that crowded - and immediately recommended by our waiter to hurry our order so we could beat the rush(?). So we ordered from the Prix Fixe menu: petite sirloin medium well & NY strip medium rare. And it basically went further downhill from there. I felt like I was at some cheap buffet chain. They put our plates down haphazardly (and weirdly) in the middle of our table each time they came out with a different course. Would it have been so difficult to place it in front of the customer who's waiting to eat? And why did you get our steak orders wrong?  Why was the steak itself so lackluster? How in the world do you get creamed spinach wrong?? Why don't you clean your restrooms? These are all questions I won't have answered because we're never going anywhere near this restaurant again. Never will I take my friends, family, my company, or even people I feel indifferent about to this ""upscale"" steakhouse.At the end of the night, my boyfriend and I laughed all the way back to our apartment, partially from disbelief, but mostly because we didn't know how else to really react.

3.0,1/30/2018,"Honestly thought this restaurant would be better. Id give it a 3.5. Reason being that my boyfriend and I came for restaurant week and the menu options were mostly additional charges in addition to the $42 for restaurant week. That's very upsetting. I ordered the calamari, the petit filet, and the mashed potatoes. My boyfriend ordered the seared ahi tuna, the chicken breast, and also the mashed potatoes. He ordered the lobster bisque too because he wanted to try that as well. The calamari had an interesting taste, it had the sweet chili sauce that I like on Thai food but on the calamari it was a bit weird. It was a big portion so I was surprised. The filet mignon was really good. It was the perfect size for me and the perfect amount of cooked meat. I like my steak medium well and somehow this is the only place that managed to have it still juicy even if it's medium well. The mashed potatoes were good but when it was cold, it hardened and wasn't really good at all after a few minutes. The seared tuna was good, my boyfriend enjoyed it. The chicken, omg the chicken, one of the best chicken we've had. It was super flavorful and the skin was super crunchy. Definitely would get this again. The lobster bisque was good, he also claimed it was the best he had. The blueberry mojito was good but my boyfriend wasn't happy that he couldn't drink it, it was soaked with too much ingredients, it was hard to sip. The cheesecake was not good at all. Sorry but why is there only one dessert option? And it was gross. It tasted like something out of a box from a supermarket. Definitely didn't enjoy it.

The menu looked great and I was super excited to finally try their steak. I got the lobster bisque as my starter which was extremely creamy but was pretty good. We were also served bread as a starter. Then ordered the 8 oz petite filet medium rare with garlic mashed potatoes. This is where things went wrong- the steak was cooked perfectly so I will give them that, but the steak was sitting in a huge pool of butter. Don't get me wrong- I love butter, but dear lord this was way too much that I couldn't even finish my steak. Same with the mashed potatoes- butter was pooling on the sides and top of it. There was so much butter i couldn't finish those either. Last but not least, the cheesecake with chocolate bark came out and that was delicious. Perfect size, amazing chocolate and not too sweet cheesecake with a creamy topping. Overall, the ambiance was good, service was okay, and food could have been much better.

Unfortunately, after last night's experience, I think my family and I need to find a new restaurant to celebrate the holiday with together.        Whether it was the disappointment we felt as we first bit into our non sizzling/overcooked steaks that did it, or the spoonfuls of luke warm creamed spinach and microwaved mashed potatoes that did the trick, I'm not sure. Maybe it was when we took a sip of our ice cold ""hot"" coffees that came out after dessert was served that really sealed the deal, who's to say. Regardless, we all agreed that if the service was half as good as what it used to be, we would've been able to overlook so much of the heartbreaking mistakes that occurred last night.         It was painfully obvious that our server did not want to be there. He didn't care about our dining experience whatsoever which is really such a shame because we entered the restaurant so excited and happy to be there.

Highly recommend reservations, they have a super easy online reservation system. We were seated promptly, we walked through the wine bottle wall hallway into an almost fine dining restaurant. They are definitely setting super high standards for every other steakhouse. I was expecting to see prices well above $100 per person but surprised that the entrees were very reasonably priced. Steaks $50-70, surf and turf starting at $60, they even offer a prefixed menu staring around $60. We got the porterhouse for two, which was delicious. It was a bit tougher than other porterhouse I have tried but I still enjoyed every bite. My friend had the prefix menu which came with an app, steak, side dish and dessert. These were full size app and side dish btw! Great deal! We shared the creme brûlée and cheesecake for dessert and both tasted delicious. Service was excellent, very attentive.

2.0,12/13/2017,"Of all the great steakhouses in NY, do not go to this mediocre chain... My boyfriend and I split the porterhouse, medium rare+, mashed potatoes and creamed spinach. The mashed potatoes were good but nothing special and I didn't love the cream spinach. It was basically just bland spinachy mush, but I'm not typically a fan of creamed spinach so maybe I'm not a great judge. My wine, an oakey Cabernet, was excellent though.Our steak was grossly undercooked. Plenty of it was completely rare (barely warm in the center!). Why have a medium rare plus option (offered by the server) if they can't even cook the steak into the right ball park? There were also a bunch of very chewy firm pieces in it. Finally, as many other reviews say, there is way too much butter on everything. It was very dissapointing overall, especially for $94. I've had better experiences buying $30 sirloins.On a positive note, the service was attentative and friendly, and I liked the ambiance, though my boyfriend found it somewhat sterile.",2,0,0,Theresa C.,"New York, NY",2,52,50

3.0,12/9/2017,"I dont know if I'm wrong or not but it feels like this restaurant is very touristy. And I dont necessarily mean that in a good way. Obviously there are other places serving good steak but being that this was the closest one to the show we were going to watch, we decided to just check the place out since the reviews werent bad anyway.We came in at 5pm, just an hour after they opened so there was no wait at all. It was dimly lit as most steakhouses are but at least i could still see my food somehow. I ordered the petite filet mignon and when it came, it looked like in such sorry state with not even a rosemary or what have you for decoration (see photo). Im not saying it should look fancy but I've been in other steakhouses that serve eye-pleasing meats even with less toppings. It wasnt such a big deal at first until I realized that the food just looked boring. In fairness, it didnt taste bad but you get my idea. I also got the shoe string fries and that looked pretty in a cone-shaped container lined with a black napkin. It looked elegant that way and the napkin helped soak the oil. The fries had a good crunch to it but sadly lacked flavor. Unless I was supposed to season with salt and pepper myself which I didnt do.(*sigh*) I always prefer to give out good reviews but unfortunately, i wasnt very pleased with this place.

4.0,11/28/2017,"3.5 stars rounded up to 4.I have mixed feelings about Ruth Chris. I have been to quite a few upscale steak houses and Ruth Chris seemed to have all the components to be up there with all of the great. As we entered, about 15 minutes early for our reservation - we were told to have a seat. No issue, we sat and waited...and waited...and waited until a passing manager said ""Are you being helped?"" I explained to him and he quickly went behind the hostess desk and was preparing the menus. The host yelled over ""Are you celebrating"" which I had indicated on our opentable reservation. I said Yes, and she said "" birthday ? anniversary ? "" from about 10 feet away where I had to yell back ""My husband got a promotion"" which was just a weird and awkward exchange to be having publicly. We were sat and they sprinkled balloon and party hat confetti on the table which was a super cute touch. Our waiter and bus staff were out of this world. Our glasses were never empty, our table was never cluttered. We definitely over ordered, but our waiter helped us save some money by pointing out the three course special and subbing the soup for the lobster bisque we were going to order regardless. Ordered:-Classic Cosmopolitan - DELICIOUS. Strong but enjoyable. -2x Lobster Bisque - which were tasty, but had an interesting tang to it. I cant put my finger on it, but as if one or two ingredients were standing out too much.-Cesar salad - basic, served its purpose.- 16 oz rib eye with a blue cheese crust which was more like  blue cheese clumps (not crispy at all, which really ruined it for my husband)-Filet Mignon & Lobster Tail Duo -  delicious! -Crab fried rice -  I am a crab fanatic, anything shellfish fanatic and this disappointed me. I just didn't enjoy it one bit. -Creamed spinach - delicious and surprisingly light, not too heavy. -Au Gratin Potatoes - good for one bite, but way too decadent. Overpowering cream. I couldn't even make out potatoes vs cream, just glops. -Ruth's trio dipping sauce - the truffle butter was nice, the shitake demi glace was my favorite and the soy honey glaze was like dipping steak into brine. I don't recall the dessert we had, but the waiter brought it out with Congratulations written in choclate and a candle, which was really nice. I hate spending $250+ for the two of us and not really enjoying all of our food but we really enjoyed our wait staff, they probably are the reason I am going to return to give the place another shot.",3,0,0,Jessica N.,"Long Island City, NY",222,410,343

The salmon was ok, not great, and the strip steak was just ok as well. I liked the garlic mashed potatoes but they add too much butter on top, it's not necessary. Also, I almost forgot the cheesecake, which was excellent. The ambiance of the restaurant seemed to be missing something. I can't quite put my finger on it-- I just feel like the prices don't match the decor or ambiance of the restaurant. The bathroom wasn't very clean and they had two broken urinals in the men's bathroom. Luckily for us, we had a patient, attentive, and mildly humorous waiter. He checked on the table and seemed very personable. Unlike the people in the front, who were too busy engaged in conversation to greet us or say anything as we departed.

I went to Morton's for restaurant week as well and ordered 6oz filet and theirs had more taste, more tenderness. That's why I am not convinced that this place and the quality of the steak was good.

Excellent cocktails. Nice dinner. Salad just okay. Crab rice was moist and good. Excellent french fries. I skipped the cream spinach we ordered. Carrot soup excellent and of course each steak was cooked as ordered. And the bread. How could I forget...loved it...just out the oven. Dessert was just okay...it was sort of an apple strudel with vanilla ice cream. I would opt for a different dessert next time but this came with the summer menu.

To help those of you with that question of ""what do I wear""...Ruth Chris has relaxed their dress code. I would imagine in part due to a location with a revolving door of tourists each day. You cannot wear sweats or workout wear yet you can wear short denim shorts (They too should be on the list) Many had on Bermuda shorts which are acceptable and of course you had locals decked out in their Sunday best to enjoy dinner.

I made a reservation for a birthday party for 10 ppl for 815 pm. We arrived and as soon we walked in the man in the front with glasses said he could not honor our reservation. I asked why and  he said  because one of the members of the group a 4'7 10 year old child had on grey sweats suit. All the other adullts where dressed fine but because of the child we could not be seated. The manager was called a woman who said that these are the policies and to check the website  before booking and that we could not be seated. I argued no where on the website or over the phone when the reservation was made  they said children are subjected to dress code. Also apon dicussing this many men  who were already inside and walking out past us had on  gym shorts on and as well training pants and sneakers. So obivously the child who wearing the sweats clearly wasnt the only one today who was  out of line. Ruth Chris management  said  it was out the norm for them to see such clothing on a child. Shame on the management and shame on Ruth Chris for allowing such behavior from their staff and management.

I had a medium rare petite filet, and the steak did NOT deliver. It was not juicy or tender, and average at best. It was something I could've easily cooked up at home and definitely not worth its price. After the steak, our server didn't come around for around another hour, which was ridiculous considering the price point of this place.

1.0,7/30/2017,"When I arrived for dinner at 6:30 PM on 7/28/17, the gentleman at the front desk said that he could not seat me due to my pants and Ruth's Chris recently enacted dress code of business casual. I was wearing plain, clean, black pants. I am an older Caucasian female. When I was working professionally as a computer programmer, I wore pants very similar to these to work in a professional, business casual, environment.  On 7/28/17 there were numerous African-American and Latino patrons who were seated without incident wearing jeans, ripped jeans, shorts, and sneakers. Clearly, such attire is NOT business casual. Why was I, an older, Caucasian female, singled out? I have a number of pictures of these patrons.   My having been singled out felt completely arbitrary and racist.  I feel that were I an African-American female or a Latina, nobody would dare have have said boo to me.  I was extremely humiliated and stressed out over the treatment that I received.",3,1,0,Judith V.,"Manhattan, NY",6,16,0

Might I add, we've never been asked for identification at any upscale restaurant before so we were already annoyed. Then to make it even worst it looked as if the portions got smaller while the price stayed the same. Out waiter JOHN was getting annoyed as well as if he had any reason to have any attitude.

We made a reservation online but about 45 mins before our reservation I called to ask them if they would change it to 15 mins later- we were stuck in traffic due to an accident. Well, the girl told us they didn't even have our reservation! She said this often happens with online reservations. Grr. But she happily made us a new reservation - they were not busy.The good- - my steak was AMAZING. I ordered the filet. It darn near MELTED in my mouth. It was ecstasy. - our server was top notch! She gave great menu advice and was on top of everything! She even brought me out a free sorbet while everyone else ate their desserts (darn allergies!).The bad-- toward the end of the evening when we were searching for the restroom, we noticed that although there was plenty of seating in the formal dining room, we had been shoved into a corner in the bar area. This boggles my mind as we were all dressed up, had reservations, and my two teenagers are extremely well-behaved. Plus this was a special event. We were insulted and felt cheated. - the sides were NOT worth the price! I ordered a baked potato and it was poorly topped and had almost no taste. They could have oiled and salted the skin- but it was dry and tasteless. $11.50 for that? Ugh! Two of the people in my party (one of whom is a mashed potato connoisseur) order the mashed potatoes and both said they were instant potatoes. What a disappointment.- the other steaks- the petite filet was lackluster and tasteless. Two of the three ribeyes were overly fatty (more than half the steak!) and just okay. Definitely not worth the price. - the salads at lower-end steakhouses are better topped. This experience was just okay and at their price point should be excellent. A $50 steak, regardless of where it appears on the menu should come with a salad. And an online reservation system that doesn't even make your reservation???

I wanted a fatty juicy cut of beef so i went for the ribeye and it didn't disappoint. Sides are standard steakhouse staples, mash potatoes, creamy spinach, and steak tartar. All very good. Red wine was decent. I give the 4 stars solely on the food which is indicative of the meal you'll have. It will be very good.

2.0,3/18/2017,"I have said this before on Yelp: I am a connoisseur of steakhouses.  I have been to Smith & Wollensky, Peter Luger, The Palm, Keens, Delmonico's, Ruth's Chris, The Capital Grille, Bobby Van's, Ben & Jack's, Uncle Jack's, Rothmann's, Gallaghers, the Bull & Bear (in the Waldorf), to BLT (in Washington, D.C.), to Shula's (in Indianapolis), and to Brumus in London (U.K.), (which is not a steakhouse, but the way they cook their cuts of meat--SO GOOD, they might as well be).  Mostly in New York, often in Long Island, often in D.C., and as far away as London (indeed, I have even been to the top steakhouses in Dhaka, Bangladesh!); I have been to these places to eat, and savor, steak.   Multiple, multiple times.  Yes, I have never been to a Morton's, or to Sparks in Manhattan (even though I worked at the United Nations for years).  But outside of that, I have more experience . . . than most.  Consistent with my past reviews, I think the only 5-star steakhouses are Smith & Wollensky and Peter Luger.  Next are all the 4-star (excellent, beyond delicious, on their own) steakhouses: Keens, Uncle Jack's, Delmonico's and Rothmann's.  Next come the 3-star steakhouses: Bobby Van's, Gallaghers, and The Capital Grille.  All of these are great restaurants, worth the extreme price you pay for the top-of-America steakhouse experience.Now, I am going to start writing about the 2-star steakhouses.  This is the type of place where you are not getting your money's worth, and maybe you should not go to this place again.  (I don't go to 2-star steakhouses again, but that is, in part, because they are always near a 3-star, 4-star, or 5-star steakhouse.  If I *could not* go to 3-star, 4-star, or 5-star steakhouses anymore (say, I lived far away from them), would I go to 2-star ones (say, there *was* a 2-star steakhouse nearby)?  Probably.  I love steak.  But, most people who read reviews like this one, who are *that interested* in deep commentary on steakhouses, live in areas with a lot of different restaurants.  So, you probably don't have to go to a 2-star steakhouse because there is no 3-star, 4-star, or 5-star steakhouse nearby.  If you don't *have* to go, don't go.And that is what Ruth's Chris Steak House is: A disappointment in New York, where, frankly, there are SO MUCH BETTER options just nearby.  Ruth's Chris charges prices above Smith & Wollensky, for small (relative to all other steakhouses) pieces of meat, not particularly well cut, that are served by competent staff (no one has ever been rude to me there, but they don't go above-and-beyond--as all steakhouses that charge these prices, and aspire to this level, should).  Creamed spinach there is O.K. (not the creamed spinach I hate at Uncle Jack's--where EVERYTHING ELSE is better, by the way), and sides in general are O.K.  But again, given what you are paying, and the league Ruth's Chris is claiming to be in by charging those prices . . . given all that, don't go.  This one is right near a Capital Grille (a much better steakhouse), the only Gallaghers (a much, much better steakhouse), and if you walk a little more east, to 3rd Avenue, you are at Smith & Wollensky, the best steakhouse in the world.  Oh, and an Uncle Jack's is near there too.Go to one of those places.  Don't go here.Again, if you *are already* at Ruth's Chris, you can still have a good meal (for much more $$$$ than you should have to pay for, given the lower quality), and they have pretty good deserts.  But that is all I can say for them.If still deciding, go somewhere else, given what amazing steakhouses there are in this part of Manhattan.",5,1,0,Bradford S.,"Chantilly, VA",38,119,750

4.0,1/5/2017,"My first introduction to Ruth Chris' Steak House was last year in San Francisco. I wasn't blown away so I wasn't really looking forward to eating here on Christmas Day. But wow. W-O-W.The service here is ON POINT. And it's not just *your* server who is friendly and accommodating, but the entire team of servers. I really hope they're getting the hourly rate they deserve because I was blown away by the service here.The atmosphere is also incredible. Dark and romantic with beautiful decor. Different from one room to the next. You're whisked away through hallways and down stairs -- we sat in a windowless room that was surprisingly relaxing and lush.The food. O.M.G. EVERYTHING here is done right. From the steaks to the salads to the lobster mac & cheese (YES!), everything here is cooked to perfection. We also had a few people with food allergies/requests and they were accommodated like it was no big deal.

1.0,1/5/2017,"My partner and I went to Ruth Chris to celebrate our engagement on 12/30/2016. We chose Ruth Chris because the Seattle location is where we had our 1 month ""Minor Anniversary"". We were looking forward to the great food, service and celebration we had experienced before. Unfortunately we had a terrible experience at the NY location and it was very disappointing! We were sat right before our reservation time, our drink orders were taken and we were brought both our drinks and bread at which point our food order was taken. Then we sat for 45minutes to an hour without anyone coming to check and see how we were doing.. when I finally waved down our waiter, he apologized and went to get our food. My steak was ordered medium well and came our rare. The plate was hot but the steak was luke warm! It was disgusting and at this point we had to hurry our meal and leave to get to our broadway show on time, so there was no sending it back. Our payment was taken and ran at the table, where the waiter stood awkwardly waiting for his tip, horrible! When the reservation was made it was noted that we were celebrating, however the classic confetti and acknowledgement of our celebration were nowhere to be found. We can understand that it was busy, but a restaurant of this caliber should be more than prepared. Ruth Chris Steakhouse in NYC took some of the magic out of our engagement night and it was very disheartening.. luckily Kinky Boots was amazing!",0,0,0,Bianca S.,"Seattle, WA",0,1,0

My favorite cocktail is the raspberry rosemary cosmo and love that it's shaken and poured tableside. I love the filet mignon and added the twin lobster tails that were the special and they were perfect, and the waiter unshelled them tableside for me as well.

I understand this since it was Christmas, so no big, we had a drink while we waited. The food was absolutely perfect, the presentation, the taste everything was on point. My only/biggest problem with our dining experience was our server. He was inattentive and very rude. On two occasions we actually had to order from two separate severs because our server was no where to be found. My brother in law had some questions about how some of the dishes were prepared and he responded in a very condescending manner. If this wasn't enough, when the bill came, our server hovered over us and went as far as to say,  ""I  just want to make sure the tip went through before you leave.""

Seasoned very well, nice and juicy but the outside of it was a little too salty for my liking. I ate it but had to keep drinking water. My bf felt the same way. Drinks were kinda watered down.

1.0,12/19/2016,My boy friend took me here on Saturday for my Birthday. The food was amazing and customer service was great until the waiter started clearing some of our plates away. He knocked over my full glass of red wine which fell onto my shirt and new pants. As you can imagine this is no way to celebrate a birthday dinner. The waiter was extremely apologetic and returned to the table with soda water to help remove some of the stain. Unfortunately the stain could not be removed. The manager was sent over to the table who apologized again on behalf of his staff. I was extremely disappointed to be told that the restaurant would only pay for my dry cleaning of the shirt as we just spent well over $200 on dinner. At the least I was hoping to have some of the bill comped along with the dry cleaning or replacement of the shirt and pants. I expressed the inconvenience of the incident as we were in town visiting for the weekend going to be meeting friends shortly after dinner. The manager then told me to please fax or email him the detailed receipt of the dry cleaning.  All in all for a prestigious steak house I was very disappointed in how their management dealt with this and will NOT be recommending this specific location to anyone.,0,0,0,Dylan M.,"Boston, MA",0,2,0
4.0,12/11/2016,"LOCATION: theater district, very close to Rockefeller center and radio city music hall.DECOR: dim lighting, upscale tables and chairs. Wine racks line most of the walls which was pretty impressive.FOOD: appetizers- we ordered the shrimp cocktail, stuffed mushrooms and lobster bisque. Shrimp cocktail was good, shrimp were huge and about 4 on each plate. Stuffed mushrooms were tiny and tasty, about 4 or 5 on the plate. Lobster bisque was in a large bowl, tasty but only 2 pieces of lobster. Dinner- ordered the Filet steak, medium well and mashed potatoes. The steak was fantastic. Very crispy and salty on outside, juicy on inside. Mashed potatoes had a hint of garlic, small portion size though for the price.Dessert- ordered chocolate duo, apple crumb tart and cheesecake. Chocolate duo was very rich and chocolatey, but tiny portion. Apple crumb tart was super good, portion enough for 2 and it was hot on inside, cold ice cream on top. Cheesecake i hated! It tasted more like just plain cream cheese than actual cheesecake. Blah!!SERVICE: average. Our waiter was friendly and efficient. Was a bit annoyed that even thought we made a reservation we still waited 30 min to be sat.I liked this place, it is definitely pricey so I'm not sure if I'd come here too often, but if I could I would.

The price fix lunch is usually a very affordable and delicious option and I've been back a few times because of the value. Today's lunch felt like they must keep two different kitchens. A regular one and one for the price fix menu. The rib eye was thin and served in a hot plate that had a layer of grease under it. I would guess that they cooked the steak in an oven in that plate. My fiancé got sick after lunch and threw up her lunch. We were ready to leave and didn't care about the dessert that's included but the waiter insisted that we can get it packaged to go so we waited a little bit and in hind sight I wish i took a picture of the 3 broken pieces of chocolate that would amount to about 1/3 of a Hershey bar or the oil soaked steak.

5.0,8/28/2016,"This is a review for the 5-course Grey Goose Vodka dinner on 8/18/2016. This was probably one of the amazing meals that I have had in a very long time. Each course was paired with a cocktail.1st course: Smoked duck breast salad paired with Le Grand Fizz. For the salad, it came with figs, apricots, and micro greens. It was a clean and simple starter dish for the upcoming courses. I like the Le Grand Fizz drink and it kinda reminds me of lemonade. This was probably my favorite drink for the night.2nd course: Dry chili rubbed salmon paired with Pear & Cardamom Collins. This course was probably my favorite. The salmon was cooked perfectly and it was moist. The salmon was served over baked fennel. The sauce was super amazing too. The drink was good and I only drank a little bit of it.3rd course: Stuff chicken breast paired with Le Melon Mile. The chicken was mouth watering delicious! I could tell that dish would be good since it smelled great and there were a lot great flavors in the dish. There were dried fruit, thyme, ginger, and potatoes. The drink was too strong for me and just had a sip.4th course: Filet mignon paired with Ruth's Dirty Goose Martini. We were also served some side dishes: Chèvre and bleu mac and cheese and fire roasted corn. I got the filet mignon well done and I thought that it was slightly salty. I also wished that there was some sauce to complement the meat. The mac and cheese was delicious and very filling. I also loved the corn side dish and the corn was so fresh! For the drink, I didn't enjoy it at all and it was super strong.Dessert: Mini chocolate almond cake paired with Francois coffee cocktail. The dessert was sweet and yummy. I only ate half of it since I was already full for the night. The drink was fine but I only took a sip since I didn't want to have difficulty sleeping at night and I had work the next day.Overall, great 5-course meal. The staff was so nice and professional.

3.0,8/21/2016,"Went here for restaurant week. Food was amazing, but the service was poor. Clearly our waiter either a.) did not want to be there, or b.) was frustrated with RW visitors. He literally threw the receipt at my friend at the end of our dining experience. He also had me ""walk her through on how to pay"", since I paid with my card first. (We split the bill). This was my first time there, and was quite appalled at the lack of professionalism. Based on the service alone, not sure if I'd return. Food:I had the filet as the main course. Asked for medium, but received medium well. Though a bit over cooked, the steak was very flavorful and tender.  The creamed spinach was also very enjoyable on the palate. I had the salad as a starter, which was okay but a bit bland. The dressing, I believe, was supposed to be of an olive oil blend-but unfortunately it lacked flavor. (I'm more of a robusto fan). Dessert was dark chocolate pieces and cheesecake. The cheesecake had a weird taste to it--possibly from the pairing of key lime spread that was paired with it. My friend liked it and ate my piece. The dark chocolate was very good, though I could've done without the raspberry sauce that it was paired with it.",2,0,1,Donielle M.,"Manhattan, NY",128,45,58

The Yelp Elite Ruth's Chris Grey Goose extravaganza this past Thursday, August 18th, 2016 made me do a lot more than howl. I think there was some singing, jumping and dancing mixed in there too.I was so fortunate to be invited to this absolutely amazing event. This was a marriage made in Culinary Heaven with a five course sit down dinner over three hours with the most delicious food served with excellence and class complemented with just magnificent libations. Our  amazing hostess and evening mc was the awesome Ana from Grey Goose. She joined our table #3 and the five of us had a blast.Ruth's Chris is elite and in a league by itself . How could you possibly achieve another level of greatness? Oh yeah, partner up with Grey Goose and love on 36 of us fortunate Yelp Elite and other guests.The tone was set when I arrived about a half hour early at 5:30 pm and was warmly greeted by two sweet, funny and happy hostesses named Laura and Vicky. The private event was on the second floor where six tables had been set for a sit down dinner for us lucky, lucky dammmmnnnn lucky folks!The first course was a Smoked Duck Breast Salad served with "" Le Grand Fizz"", a beautiful and tasty blend of Grey Goose Vodka and St-Germain Elderflower Liqueur w fresh lime juice finished with the fizz of chilled soda water. Simply put, Magnifique and my favorite of the five great and huge cocktails served.The second course was dry chili rubbed salmon with a Pear & Cardamom Collins.( please see the photo with the description). The third course was a stuffed chicken breast in the most incredible sauce paired with Le Lemon Mule.Course #4 -  lovely Filet Mignon accompanied by chèvre and blue Mac and cheese plus fire roasted corn. This went so incredibly well with Ruth's Dirty Goose and very potent martini containing the two gorgeous olives.Course Five was a Mini Chocolate Almond Cake and Dark Chocolate almond bark with Francois's Coffee Cocktail. The cake was rich and just one of the most sinfully delicious desserts I have had. I do believe that there was some moaning and howling in unison after my table mates first bites.The chocolate bark was fresh and melted in my mouth.The salmon and the chicken were exquisite and testament to Ruth's Chris being a lot more than just a primo steak house. Gotta have room for this quality of desserts! You really do.Our servers at table #3, Raino, James and Kay were the best of the best.Everyone seemed to be having a great time and there was a lot of good energy and laughter on the second floor. The lovely and unique five cocktails absolutely contributed to the merriment.This was a classy event with just perfection in everything.Finished around 9:15 pm last night. Got home at 10:00 after Course 6 which was that brisk 29 block walk south and east to Gramercy Park. Course 7: I was at LA Fitness in LI at 6:30 am Friday morning ready for some racquetball and some serious cardio but with that huge smile on my face. Thank you Yelp!

4.0,8/17/2016,"Had been craving Ruth's Chris for YEARS...having been seeing posts about this place on people's timeline and hearing references in some songs and finally gave in and tried Ruth's Chris on a random Monday for lunch after running some errands.Of course had steak...duh, along with the grilled shrimp and mashed potatoes. Salad and bread before the entree and also key lime pie for dessert. Everything was AMAZING. Had my steak medium well and very tender. Could of used some steak sauce but that was possibly my mistake for not asking. Shrimps were cooked and seasoned very well. Mashed potatoes very good. And me not being a pie eater to had eaten the slice of key lime pie, I was very impressed. Ate everything of everything with not a complaint about the food nor the service which was very good as well. No high drawbacks about Ruth Chris...except for maybe the fact that when you walk upon the restaurant it is located at the lower floor of a hotel and they have draped curtains over the windows which kind of gives off the impression that they could be closed when they are actually open. Other than that, no real gripes about this restaurant and a nice place to take a date or have a family dinner at. A little pricey but worth it.",0,0,0,Jay L.,"Harlem, Manhattan, NY",162,600,50

The wait staff really does their best to accommodate everyone. The atmosphere is great as well, its not too bright or dark and everything is spaced out.Now for the food. Both times I've eaten here I have ordered the filet mignon and have not been disappointed. It is so tender and flavorful.

5.0,8/7/2016,This was my second time going to Ruth Chris for there restaurant week event.  The timing was perfect since it fell around the same time as my wedding anniversary. Yay. For appetizers we had corn chowder soup (yummy) and salad. For the main course I had a tender 8oz petit filet (mouth watering) while my husband upgraded to the NY Strip and grilled shrimp. We had to share the sides it was so plentiful. The wait staff was professional and courteous so no complaints there. All in all it was great. Only downside was it had gotten a little noisy by the time our dessert arrived. This cause me to ask to take my dessert home. See you again next year.,0,0,0,Tracey S.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,39,6

5.0,8/3/2016,"I think this is the best deal you could probably get for restaurant week lunch. I came hungry and left extremely satisfied. The service, the food, the atmosphere was nothing short of excellent. As soon as we sat down they brought the water and warm baguette (with whipped butter of course). It was an amazing start to our experience. The pace of the service was perfect as they noticed when we were finished and checked in periodically. -Corn Chowder-delicious with the baguette. not as creamy or heavy as I expected, which I liked-Filet Petite(medium rare 6oz.) - AMAZING. I would suggest you order one level down as this was cooked medium instead of medium rare (if you want medium well then state medium). The plate was sizzling hot and kept warm well into the meal so you can take time to enjoy the steak itself. Every bite was delicious...if you put the sides on the plate..it will heat up your sides as well (we got the creamed spinach and mashed potatoes which were ok, but definitely the highlight was the meat itself). One of the best steaks I had as the meat was juicy/tender, the texture amazing and full of flavor every bite, not to mention perfect portioning for lunch. -Key lime cheesecake that came with the menu was great. I don't even like key lime flavors but I thought this was still very well executed. The pecan chocolate bark/raspberry sauce was a good contrast I am a fan especially because as a renowned steakhouse they have no need to participate in restaurant week, nor do they need to offer their best for the restaurant week menu but it seems like they put effort into every dish they serve...which is a reflection of an amazing restaurant. I was extremely impressed with my experience and would highly recommend this steakhouse for fancy occasions.",3,0,1,Shushu C.,"Los Angeles, CA",307,462,409

The Parc Room was the perfect size for our dinner party and the lighting was perfect as was the décor.  The dinner was just about 3 hours and the food came out timely. Everyone's lobster and steak was perfectly cooked and the crème brule and personal size cheese cake was absolutely delicious.  The only quirk I had was arranging the dinner with the different managers involved.  It was difficult getting any simple questions answered immediately since they prefer to email vs chatting by phone.  But moving on, Ruths Chris name speaks for itself - great steak and great service.",0,0,0,Stan S.,"New York, NY",0,32,0
5.0,8/1/2016,"Arriving at Ruth Chris' we were welcomed warmly and directed upstairs to the Yelp event. The main restaurant looked busy and the atmosphere was warm and the vibe good! People were clearly enjoying the ambience of the place and it certainly created a strong first impression. Throughout the evening, servers brought out platters of steak to enjoy with bread. There was also horseradish sauce which was a great compliment to the mouth watering steak we were treated to. It certainly whet my appetite to return to Ruth Chris' in the future. Cocktails were free flowing and we enjoyed the refreshing Raspberry Cooler whilst enjoying the fun atmosphere of the event. The service was excellent and the servers helped my friend and I get empanadas after we tried to get tuna ahi and failed due to the popularity and the speed at which these canapes were devoured!

(See my photo of the special menu. And photos of the delicious meal!! ).  So, that made my birthday even more fun for me. Hey, who doesn't love a fantastic bargain?!!  Altho, my dear friend who was treating me, said that since I've wanted to try Ruth's Chris Steakhouse for as long as I've said, she was treating, didn't matter about restaurant week. Very kind & generous. Thank you Lauren! Ok--we ordered from the 3-course, Restaurant Week Menu.  Dinner, $42.  This menu happened to have every item I had wanted to try!!!!EVERYTHING WAS DELICIOUS, WONDERFUL, FANTASTIC.  Honestly, if you plan to visit NYC, come here for a delicious dinner, in spacious surroundings.  Whether it's restaurant week or not, make a reservation!! We both started with the ""steakhouse salad""--the steakhouse salad was delicious & beautifully presented. A fine assortment of greens. I enjoyed a yummy Balsamic Vinaigrette dressing on the side.  Forgot to take a photo due to the birthday excitement of being in a lovely room at Ruth's Chris Steakhouse, and being very hungry. The restaurant is quite large, I will definitely be back!! Our servers were very nice and helpful--Andrew and I believe, Alfonso.  We had creamed spinach as a side, and garlic mashed potatoes as our other side. One side per order. We each really, really enjoyed the 8 oz. Petit Filet.  This was so wonderfully delicious!!! This steak was served on a 500 degree, SIZZLING HOT PLATE--DO NOT TOUCH THE PLATE!! The steak had that bit of crispiness on top, and unbelievable tenderness inside. My ""medium"" was perfection, with the perfect pink in center of each slice I cut.  I LOVED MY STEAK!!!! And so did my friend. I raved over and over about how delicious the steak was, with almost every bite...it was so soft & delicious. I'm definitely going back !!!And for dessert, we had the Key Lime Cheesecake--delicious!! AND, A BEAUTIFUL SPECIAL BIRTHDAY DESSERT---WONDERFUL!!! A  RICH CHOCOLATE--FLOURLESS ROUND, CREAMY RICH DESSERT, AND THE MOST WONDERFULLY , FRESH RASPBERRY SORBET. THE MOST WONDERFUL RASPBERRY SORBET I HAVE EVER HAD!!!!!!  And written on the special, square, white dessert plate was Happy Birthday, in Chocolate.

We were all present by 834pm but weren't seated until after 930pm and many excuses later. Our waiter was fairly attentive but since it was so late and since we had waited so long, I expected a little more attention and speedier service to compensate. Unfortunately there was no special consideration. Our entrées weren't served until 1030pm. At no point in time did a manager come check on us or acknowledge our wait time.

The waiter was so nice and attentive I could tip him again and I will cause I'm definitely going back.

And it didn't even have any sides wtf? Also all their steaks are cooked the same with salt, pepper and butter. Even if you got other meat dishes, you have to purchase the sides.It's put on a hot plate so it stays warm for your entire meal. I also had the sides of mashed potatoes and brussels sprouts. The mashed potatoes was tasty and the brussels sprouts were baked so they were crunchy and flavourful.The service was pretty good at this restaurant, but similar to the tier of service offered at other high tier steak houses. In the end, it was almost $300 for 4 people.I think it's only marginal than restaurants with $30 steaks and I don't think it's worth the incredibly expensive prices. Don't get me wrong, these steaks are pretty good! And they are flavoured differently from all the other steaks. Having the hot plate is pretty neat too.

5.0,3/19/2016,"This is review is pretty late, but better late than never! (Yes, I know, very cliche.) Visit: 09/02/2014After looking at an extensive amount of steakhouses for my boyfriend's birthday, I decided to go to Ruth's Chris because of all the good reviews. I was a little bit worried that it might not be worth it because of it being a chain restaurant, but that worry was obviously unfounded and unnecessary, which was was proven as soon as I walked into the establishment. The restaurant was dimly lit and arranged nicely. As noted in other reviews, the dress code isn't really enforced. When I was there, there was a couple that was dressed very casually, which kind of seemed out of place, but it didn't really bother me. I do have to note that the most amazing thing about our visit was our waiter. I kind of regret not getting his name! I swear he has to be a spy and works at this place as a cover up or something. The way he spoke was formal - but not stiff - and very fluid. It was just pleasant to the ears. The way he held himself was also pretty impressive. If it's your first time eating here, he'll give you an introduction to their restaurant and steaks. Anyway! The food. The food was amazing. I don't know if meat should be described this way but... I ordered a filet mignon (the smaller one since I get full quickly) and it was - dare I say it - creamy... and oh-so-good. It was a pleasant surprise. I got the order with a lobster tail, which was alright. As our waiter told a customer at another table, ""It is Ruth's Chris /Steak House...,"" which is why he was hyping up the steak but not really the seafood. So, you could probably do without the lobster tail. The waiter did conveniently cut out the tails for me. I passed on the wine pairing and got a blueberry cocktail instead, which probably wasn't the best idea. I'll make up for it next time!I think my boyfriend got a skirt steak. I don't really remember, but I think he liked my food better, although he still liked his own order.For dessert, we had the bread pudding. It was pretty good, but not exactly my favorite since I like really sweet and sugary things. If you're looking for something on the milder side after all that steak-y goodness, the bread pudding is probably a good choice then; I believe it might have been one of their seasonal desserts though.Skipping my review on the appetizers since I don't remember them very well.Side note: Women's bathroom is also dimly lit. Could use a little brightening up but not really a problem.TL;DR: It's great, eat here. Will come back!",3,1,2,Aimee L.,"Mastic Beach, NY",145,117,573
2.0,3/17/2016,"Went here with coworkers for dinner and the experience was lackluster. We ordered a bunch of sides - lobster mac and cheese, creamed spinach were the better of the bunch, but still I've had much better elsewhere. I ordered the petite fliet, medium rare (which came out medium, but not a huge deal), and that was quite disappointing. Texture was fine, nothing special, but flavor was bland. Finally dessert which we shared as a table - creme brulee, chocolate duo, and apple crumb tart - were average. Large portions, not terrible tasting but again, really nothing special.

3.0,3/16/2016,"The FoodMy latest visit was my 2nd one. The visits were exactly 1 year apart. I had the same meal both times.  I had the Prix Fixe Filet Mignon meal.  Last year the steak was melt in my mouth delicious, this time I was not satisfied.  I told the waiter that this Filet was not as good as it was in the past. I had to saw through the meat, and I ordered it Medium. He quickly removed it and brought me an entire new meal.  The second steak was much better, and the Manager brought it to me personally.  The waiter later said ""I had the chef prepare you a center cut.""  My question is why didn't I get that to start with.  Is it customary for the Prix Fixe to have a substandard cut? It wasn't the case last year.  My daughter had a NY Strip (not Prix Fixe).  Again, what a difference a year makes.  Last year she ate every bite, this year, there was so much fat on the steak, she was not satisfied. However, our waiter rectified that situation as well.The side dishes both times were excellent. Last time I had some cap mushrooms this time I had the potatoes.  No complaints on that front.  Desserts were delicious as well.Waiter ServiceBecause of the service of our waiter, I upped this review to three stars.  Otherwise it would have received 2 stars.  Our waiter, Steven, went above and beyond the call, was attentive, sweet, and polite. If Ruth's Chris' food was up to par, this restaurant would be out of this world. Because the atmosphere is great. They have three or four separate rooms with different ambiance.  A more sports oriented room, a romantic room, a more casual room.The taste of the food is a 5.  I am disappointed with the recent cuts of meat we were served.Ruth's Chris, please bring that up to standard.",1,0,0,Liz K.,"Bronx, NY",3,33,0
2.0,3/9/2016,"February Taste of Spain Wine Dinner:  I am a big fan of tasting menus.  At $95 I thought how bad could it be.....  Venue:  The tasting was in the private upstairs area of the restaurant.  They had round tables of 12, therefore, you had to sit with other people outside of your party.  The lights were turned all the way up, there was no music, everything was just off and it looked like the event was just tossed together.  Menu:  Five Courses.  All of the portions were fairly large compared to most tastings.  - Kumato Tomato and Herbed Goat Cheese Salad:  Hands down the best dish of the night.  The tomatoes were ripe, the cheese was fresh, everything was perfect about this dish.  -Lobster Paella:  The lobster was rubbery.  2 of my 3 mussels were not open (dead).  -Sherry BBQ Glazed Pork Tenderloin:  Aside from the salad, this was not bad.  Decent size portion of pork and the meat itself was very tender.  -Filet Mignon Topped with Piquillo Pepper Butter:  The meat was cooked medium rare as requested however the quality of the filet was just so so.  I found it to be very grainy.  In terms of the seasoning, it was way too peppery/buttery, almost overbearing.  -Tres Leches Cake:  Way too sweet.  I took one bite and that was enough.  Disappointing. Service:  The service was very disorganized.  Waiters seemed like they did not know where to go or what to do.  There was almost too many of them.  They were all very polite and friendly.   Wine/Pairing:  Each course was paired with a Torres wine.  I was very disappointed with the pours and the inconsistency from one glass to the next.  None of the pours were proper.  Looking at the glasses around the table, all of them were uneven.  It was kind of sad.Once each course was brought out, the wine distributors gave you a little background on the wine and region it was from.  It was informative however by the 3rd course it became annoying.  I could not believe that they did not give us the option to buy the wine which we sampled.  Also, unlike most tastings, they did not offer you any additional, one glass of unequal pour and that was it.  Torres Distributer:  During one of the wine briefings, the distributer asked a trivia question to the audience.  A person from my table answered correctly.  The distributor then said 'congratulations you get a free bottle'.  Throughout the dinner, he was expecting that bottle to share with the table.  As it turns out, the guy was 'joking'.  He said some nonsense about giving out alcohol as a gift is not allowed.  I'm not sure what made the person at my table more mad; the fact that the distributor 'joked' about his free bottle or that he sat there and watched as the distributor whipped out extra bottles from his suitcase and continually filled the glasses of those at his table not even offering him a 'I'm sorry here is a glass at least'.  By the time desert arrived, we took one bite and were out the door.  This is definitely not a tasting I would recommend.",4,2,1,Candace A.,"Manhattan, NY",192,184,655

3.0,3/1/2016,"My first time at Ruth Chris in NY I frequented their location in Rhode Island. Had a reservation, we arrived early and was seated right away. Our server was nice and efficient.  Took awhile for us to flag him down for the check though. The dining room was full. But they were definitely turning them tables. Ambience was great. Typical set up for establishment of this caliber. The noise level was very low. Seating was pretty close together as I could easily be involved in the party to my left and right conversation.  To those who've never been, RC niche is they serve their steaks on 500 degree plates. Bread and butter they gave was great. I know its essentially bread and butter. But some restaurants try to be too creative and end up falling flat. Well made baguette, crusty on the outside and soft on the inside. It was still warm though we ignored it for 10 mins. Butter was salted and whipped which made spreading a breeze. We tried not to eat all of it, but couldn't resist. We got a ton of things to share. The meal was very well paced out.Crab stack was great. Lump crab, with avocado, mango, cilantro and pickled cucumber, onions and red peppers. Well balanced, a great portion and refreshing. Like a salad without the lettuce. Really hit all flavor profiles. The blue crab cakes weren't as good as I remember. For the most part the flavor was there. However the texture was stringy and they were unevenly cooked. The spicy lobster was tasty. Fried pieces of lobster were still tender and crisp though tossed in a cream sauce. The natural sweetness from the lobster played off the spiciness in the sauce. They were served with pickled cucumbers, red onions & bell pepper. I need the recipe for their pickling liquid. Vegetables were so delicious. Their lobster bisque was the best I've had in a while. Perfect viscosity and mouthfeel. Great seafood flavor. Spicy undertone and a huge portion for the price. So satisfying. The veal osso buco ravioli was decent. Saffron really came through and the the ravioli were cooked perfectly. Sauce was light but had a nice acidity. The spinach was good though I really did not feel like it belonged. Almost like an afterthought added to the plate for color.   My real complaint would be the veal itself. It was kind of lost in the ravioli like I couldn't identify it. Maybe if it was a cut into little chunk inside the ravioli it would've been better. I would've like to bite into it. I think it was shredded or in minuscule pieces. I was extremely disappointed in the lamb. Flavor was great and it was very well seasoned. When I saw those huge chops coming towards me, my mouth watered instantaneously. However they were 90% fat. No exaggeration. The portions of meat I did get were great. It was cooked more rare then the medium rare I asked for. But I like both temperatures, so it was fine. They definitely need to trim more/better. I added a lobster tail which was very succulent, tender and delicious. The 16oz ribeye was delicious. Super tender and flavorful. All meat, little fat and no bone. Cooked perfect medium rare. I added a side of shrimp which were perfectly cooked, buttery goodness. Yum!Dessert was the worst part of the meal. I was craving chocolate mousse and was happy to see they had it on the menu. It was part of what they called ""chocolate duo"" it was supposed to be a espresso cup of mousse and a chocolate lava cake. I wasn't in the mood for lava cake so I asked for 2 cups of  mousse instead. First off it was too sweet. Secondly the quality of chocolate was poor. Tasted like nestle, Hershey or one of those cheap brands. I like my mousses made with couverture. It was light and airy  but left so much more to be desired in terms of flavor.  We had a nice bottle of burgundy. Two cocktails the Ruby Red Greyhound and the Gold Standard. The RRG was so refreshing and well balanced. If you bottle up a perfect summer day the RRG is what it would taste like. Nice size portion too. The GS was great as well. I asked for the cardamon syrup to be subbed with regular syrup and it worked. I dislike cardamon. Can't go wrong with a mix of champagne and woodford reserve. Two of my favorite libations. Overall it was decent dining experience. A few misses. I'd go back and just stick to what worked.",1,0,0,Akeema R.,"Manhattan, NY",62,38,118
4.0,2/26/2016,"This review is for the truly fantastic Taste of Spain Torres Wine dinner we had last night. We were seated in a private room upstairs in round tables sort of like a wedding. We had four courses along with a wine paring with each course along with a great mixed drink of Spanish Liquor with dessert. First we Kumato Tomato and herbed goat cheese salad pared with a nice fragrant white wine.Second course was Lobster Paella pared with with Celeste Tempranillo, medium body and not too overly heavy as to not over power the seafood.Third course was a wonderful glazed pork tenderloin with an unusual avocado salsa pared with the best wine of the night, Salmos red blend. Full bodied and fragrant. Everybody at our table loved it.Last was a great small Filet Mignon topped with pepper butter and prepared exactly as I requested, medium rare served with lyonnaise fingerling potatoes and green string beans with almonds. Accompanied by a Cabernet Sauvignon-  quite good and would have been much more appreciated had it not been for the memorable Salmos served in the previous course.Don't forget dessert - a Tres Leches Cake with orange whipped cream and along side a solid chocolate cookie with what looked to be pistachio nuts.Served with a brandy and orange liqueor cocktailThey gave a short explanation of each wine as they were served. The service was right on and each table was served in unison. All the food with the exception of the paella (rice over done) was really over the top.

5.0,2/23/2016,"We ate here for Valentine's Day with a standard dinner time reservation. First, let me say that I appreciated how they divided up the restaurant. By creating different sections, they were able to successfully seat a large number of patrons while still preserving the intimate feel of a small restaurant. Our servers were able to keep things formal while still managing to make us laugh throughout the night. While I thought the bread was a little harder than I would have liked, I enjoyed my caesar salad. The salad was so huge, I couldn't finish it and still leave space for the main course! (You could easily eat the salad alone for a light lunch.)There was a little bit of a mixup in getting us our lobster mac and cheese, but our waiter corrected the problem as soon as we brought it to his attention. I loved my filet and thought it was a typical portion size. It also came with shrimp, which I found to be a little unusual. My bf enjoyed his ribeye.

1.0,2/18/2016,"My friend and i spent almost $200 for the restaurant week dinner menu and had one bite each of the NY Strip and whatever the dessert was. The menu description used the word 'slightly firm/tough' which i found hard to believe. I was chewing it like gum, was unable to swallow, so i spitted it out on paper napkins. Our server was very professional with us and offered us to bring a new plate. Meanwhile a lady with im-so-pissed-and-ready-to-scream face walked over to our table, gave us this pissed look(almost seems like her face was saying to us, ""You better not complain!"") and asked if everything was okay.  We both were very offended by her expression and her tone. As we answered she was already turning away from us. When our server returned to us, we asked who that lady was and surprisingly, she turned out to be the manager. I tried the new steak that arrived and the funniest thing was that now it's not only too tough to eat, but it was also too salty to even taste. Thank god i have low blood pressure. I went back home and checked my blood pressure and hallelujah~ I'm normal!! So my friend and i ended up just chatting there over the rubbery substances that looked and smelled like steak for a little.Then the dessert surprised us once again. Unevenly cut, saggy, and unattractive at all. Seriously what happened to the whipped cream?  The flavor wasn't attractive either. It obviously was either super old or has been sitting outside for a long long long while.And another little thing was that a busser came to our table and scaped our table for the first time after we were finished with the entree. So we've been dining with bread crumbs and etc. So there it is.

We immediately asked to be moved which the host understood and took us back downstairs. We were then brought to a section with a waiter named Michael.

I got to sit among the regular patrons too and not in some RW scrub area which is always a plus.I started off with a nice fresh loaf of complimentary Italian bread and whipped butter (had to ask for the bread though).The RW menu was a bit limited, but ended up going with the soup for app, stuffed chicken, and dessert, and opted for the $18 2-wine glass pairing. They have all these extra add-ons like $3 FOR SAUCE, $5 for a bleu cheese crust on your steak, $15 for shrimp, but I recommend you just skip all that BS.White bean and Chorizo soup - not bad. Small cup portion like Morton's. Tasted similar to minestrone. Average.Stuffed chicken - massive. About 16 oz of pure chicken goodness. Great crispy crust, moist meat, and seasoned well. The garlic/herb cheese stuffing was also a great touch. I liked it a lot.Creamed Spinach - generous portion for a side dish. Went great with the chicken.Chocolate Mousse Cake with an Oreo Crust - surprisingly really good. Tasted very fresh.

We were joined at the bar by a friend who lives in NYC. The sazerac cocktail was good but tasted more like a Manhattan than anything else. The dinner started out well enough although they could improve the bread. Caesar salads - good, the lobster Mac and cheese and Brussels sprouts really good. The steak, however, is overrated especially for the price. My husband's t-bone was cooked perfectly. I ordered the petite rib-eye only to be served an overdone, beige pice of meat. No sear at all. I sent it back and requested the filet instead which was very good. However, they brought it out so quickly that the oil was still sputtering on the plate and splashed all over me soiling my sweater. They did, however, complete the meal with complimentary desserts for my husband's birthday. And the wait staff were very nice and attentive.All in all, it was an okay dining experience but not for that kind of money. We can cook a good steak at home.

Up until this past week we had nothing but good things to say. The service was not up to par from past visits. The staff seemed tired and not willing to help with our needs. We were seated upstairs and it  seemed strange that kitchen staff was bringing trays of prepared food, not orders past our table frequently going downstairs.  Our drink order, which I had to ask twice for was delayed. Our appetizers, lobster bisque soup, which had too strong of an alcohol odor & taste was lukewarm at best. Calamari was very tasty, but again was luke warm at best. Our meals which were filets & ribeyes were not to previous standards. The filets were cooked perfectly, but had no taste. The ribeyes were tasty, but over cooked. Lastly,both the restrooms were filthy and did not have the required supplies, especially the ladies room !!! I believe a good shake up of the staff and a renovation is in order.

EVERYTHING here is great... from the sizzling steaks, to the super tasty crab cakes, to the sinfully delicious desserts. LOVE LOVE LOVE. While I've had most of their steaks, the Filet Mignon is my favorite. Best cut, super tender and flavorful. However, if you have an appetite, the Porter House is no joke, especially the one for 2. The crab cake appetizers are a MUST.. or can be added to your steak. And you HAVE to get sides.. the creamed spinach, mushrooms, potatoes au gratin rank among my favorites. Add a Lobster tail too, you won't be disappointed. Always the highest quality of product and no matter which location you eat at, you can expect the same.

I am a fan of Ruth's when I'm abroad for a work function - especially in countries where steakhouses are few and inconsistent. Unfortunately, great in Asia does not equate great in America - especially not in NYC. Service was weird - the waitress was friendly but quite abrupt with me. I went with family and I was the youngest one there (I also look quite young for my age), but that doesn't excuse her from making any assumptions and treating me differently. I ordered wine for the table - but she decided to bring everyone a glass besides me (without asking or confirming!). I've never encountered this before at a restaurant - most places have the decency to at least confirm my age.As for food:- Caesar salad is solid and perfectly dressed- Creamed spinach tasted really funky - not in the good way- Ribeye - over seasoned and overcooked. The steak was simply too salty and I received a medium-well steak when I asked for medium-rare.All in all, you can definitely spend less in NYC for a better experience elsewhere.

We were seated on the second floor at what appeared to be a folding table with a table cloth. We overheard the waitress explaining the background/history of Ruth Chris to other tables, but walked up to us and simply asked, ""Do you know what you want?"" We watched as other servers went to multiple tables asking if they had ordered appetizers or salads, as if they had no idea where they were meant to be taking the food. Luckily, I waved down our appetizer before another server took it back into the kitchen! This was very hard for me to understand, as I heard some of them counting table numbers, and know from working in restaurants it's typically one of the first parts of your training experience. I was also taken aback when our server walked over to take our (payed) check off the table while we were wrapping up our drinks/conversation. She seemed to be in a bad mood and rush our entire meal.

My son doesn't eat meat so he ordered the stuffed chicken breasts, crispy skin, looking scrumptious, he never touched it.

5.0,6/22/2015,"I visited the NYC location on Father's Day June 21, 2015. I had a party of 9 and traffic was horrendous due to a street fair so we were 30 minutes late. The staff was understanding and extremely accommodating. My mother is bound to her wheelchair and requires a hoyer lift to be placed into and out of her chair. Although there were a total of 8 stairs upon entering the establishment, the wait staff was willing to help carry her down. The manager then offered another solution and allowed us to use their service elevator and dine in the private room located upstairs without any added charges. Our waiter Mike was patient, personable and very attentive. NOW ONTO THE FOOD! Unfortunately I didn't take any pictures because I was so excited to eat I had forgotten lol.              We started off with the spicy lobster bites, shrimp cocktail, and stuffed mushroom appetizers. Most appetizers, sides, and desserts are large enough to share with two people, so we ordered 5 appetizers for the table but it was so good they went fast. The lobster bites were lightly fired and spicy but not so much that it was overwhelming. The stuffed crabmeat mushrooms and cocktail sauce for the shrimp cocktail were amazing and offered a great blend of spices. Im not a big steak eater (I KNOW, I KNOW, why go to a steakhouse? It was fathers day, so I couldn't deny the special men in my life the chance to eat an awesome steak) so I ordered the stuffed chicken breast. It was succulent and the second I cut into it, I could see the herb cheese ooze out of it. My family ordered the lobster tail with petite steak and the kids ordered crab cakes and french fries. I heard no complaints from them, so I'm assuming their meal was delicious as mine was. For sides we ordered the scalloped potatoes, creamed spinach, sweet potato casserole, lobster macaroni and cheese, and broccoli. I believe the highlight of the sides was the sweet potato casserole and the lobster mac and cheese.                The lobster mac had generous amounts of lobster and was super cheesy. The sweet potato casserole was awesome. It had a pecan crust and wasn't too sweet, it was just right. For dessert we ordered bread pudding, warm apple tart a la mode, ice-cream, and cheesecake with fresh berries. Every bite was better than the last. We had three children ages 12, 12 and 6 and they had a great time and didn't complain once about the lack of chicken nuggets or burgers.

We ordered the mozzarella tomato appetizer, which was great, and then the porterhouse for two, which was surprisingly less expensive than that in Aruba. Honestly, that was the best steak I've ever had in my entire life. Better than Peter Luger's, better than any other steakhouse period. Not sure what they do to it, but it was amazing. We also had the asparagus side dish, and the sweet potato casserole (tastes like a dessert, it's so freakin' good!).

3.0,5/7/2015,"I am a fan of Ruth's Chris and have enjoyed some of the best steaks I've ever had at several locations across the country.  My recent visit to the midtown location--my first visit at this restaurant--was, to be honest, the most average Ruth's experience I've had, which is disappointing, since I'm a fan.  The decor of this Ruth's, like its other locations, is fine. They all tend to feel a little too ""corporate"" for me, but the midtown Ruth's has a nice, dark, upscale feel. Our server, when he was there, was spectacularly professional and helpful. Alas, he wasn't always there. We waited for a while for him to visit for second drinks and the check was so slow in arriving it might have caused a less ethical diner to attempt a dine and dash.  More concerning, however, was that we specifically told our server that we were not in a rush and were hoping to enjoy a leisurely dinner. (Seemed a good idea since many folks who dine here need to get to a nearby show for opening curtain.)  Despite the very specific request, our steaks arrived before we were done with our salads. As for the food, the steak preparation was very good (as always), but it was without any doubt the lowest quality cut I have ever had at a Ruth's (and I'd guess I've had several dozen meals at Ruth's over the years.)  My filet was fatty and parts were tough to eat.  My wife suggested it was because we ordered off the special ""Ruth's Classics"" menu (which included a side and dessert). I hope that isn't the case, because even the Classics menu wasn't cheap (although, by NYC standards, the cost was quite reasonable.)So, unlike times I've visited other Ruth's, this visit was disappointing for a couple of different reasons. To be clear, it was still a nice experience, but it was far from the standout experience I have come to expect from Ruth's.",4,1,0,Augie R.,"Chicago, IL",167,835,147

The tourists had started popping their heads back into the city, but the crowds overall weren't that bad.The service at this RCSH is okay.

Even so, it didn't seem too packed for a Friday night at 7. There were probably only a few parties waiting but the way I see it - if you can reserve (especially online), then why the hell not??If you don't know, the restaurant week menu is a set menu for $38, and you have a few options for each course (usually a starter, entree, and a dessert).To start, I went with the Louisiana gumbo. I wasn't really expecting much but I really liked it. In fact, I think I might have even liked it better than the gumbos I've had in New Orleans (which were way too salty but that's another story for a different day). It wasn't too heavy or too salty, but still had a great cajun-y flavor to it.For my main course, I opted for the filet mignon. I like my steak medium rare. But sometimes, steakhouses make medium rare too rare, and they'll make medium too well done. I decided to take a gamble and go with medium rare. It was perfect for me. On the other hand, my friend also ordered the same filet mignon medium rare and hers came out almost medium well. Either the waiter misheard her, or else ordering the steaks here are really just a shot in the dark.With this pre-set menu, you also get a choice of a side dish. I knew I went some greens to go with my steak so I went with the creamed spinach. I thought I liked it at first. Pretty standard creamed spinach. That is until my friend tried it and said it tasted like green tea - similar to the matcha they use in green tea frappucinos. And after that, I couldn't stop tasting the green tea in there!For dessert, I had the bread pudding. It had pecans, which I'm not a fan of - but I didn't mind it in there. I only wish I wasn't too full to finish all of it.I noticed they have happy hour. It's only at the bar but they have a bar area where there are a few high top tables you can sit at. It's from 4-6:30 - $5 select beers, $7 select wines and cocktails, and $8 select appetizers - so I'll definitely be back to try some of these!",3,0,0,Mel T.,"New York, NY",444,1319,3268

Then, after we paid, we needed change and had to wait another 20 minutes until our waiter came back around.The steak was good though. Oh god and the ahi tuna was amazing- they had some kind of wasabi sauce that just brought the entire dish together, along with sweet buttery tuna. Loved it. Better than joeys. Bread pudding and chocolate bark was a poor ending. If I came back, I'd skip desert- maybe just stop by a froyo place on my way home.",3,0,0,Christine K.,"Markham, Canada",6,14,9

I arrived  30 minutes before the Bday girl and had a seat at the bar. The bartender, Michael, was very helpful. He gave recommendations for our cocktails and even discussed a few whiskeys, my drink of choice. When the Bday girl arrived we were escorted to our table which was already set and waiting for us. Our server, Laz, was very attentive and friendly. He asked if it was our 1st time, I said yes. He explained that the plates come out hot and the steaks are in butter and salt/pepper. Since we had a child with us he made sure that her food was on a cold plate. Safety 1st. We ordered effortlessly and Laz got everything down perfectly. I ordered the 8oz Filet with Bleu cheese crust & 6 jumbo shrimp, a side of sweet potato Casserole and fried calamari in chili sauce. Some other orders placed were the stuffed chicken, ny strip, mac and cheese and mashed potatoes. The appetizers were brought out in under 10 minutes food within 20 min. Everything cooked to order. Filet was med well and strip med rare. THE SWEET POTATO CASSEROLE is a must have. It could've been a dessert. As a consumer, I believe you get what you pay for.

4.0,3/3/2015,"Came here for restaurant week with a group of 8. The appetizers were okay, although I would avoid the seafood gumbo which was a little too salty. There weren't any options for dessert which was a bread pudding that was pretty good but it kind of sucked having 8 people eat the same thing. The steak, which is obviously what any sane person cares about when going to a steakhouse, was off the hook. Despite getting the 16 oz. ribeye, I would definitely go with the filet which I tried a bit of. The steaks came out sizzling off the plate and were perfectly seasoned with an extensive wine list to complement.There was plenty of staff and our waiter was awesome and attentive.Only bad note was that I left a bag with some brand new running gear I just bought at Nike. I called the next day and they said they hadn't found anything while cleaning so I left my phone number. Unfortunately, we were the last ones to leave the restaurant that night so it had to have been picked up by the staff :/My phone number, name and shipping address were also all in that shopping bag so whoever took it definitely didn't bother to send it back despite having the information.I would definitely go back, but I wouldn't recommend shopping before drinking and getting stuffed to the point of forgetting anything.",0,0,0,Tom C.,"Manhattan, NY",51,25,12

My daughter ate most of the soup and she doesn't even like seafood. That's how good it was ! My mom didn't like any of the appetizers they had to offer so she opted for Fried Calamari for an extra $9.95 to the pre fixed price of $38. The Calamari got my mother's approval and she's a very hard critic-lol. For my Entrée I got the Stuffed Chicken Breast with a side of Creamed Spinach. It was delicious ! I love how the plates are hot and the food is sizzling by the time it comes to you. The chicken was moist and the creamed spinach was perfect. My mom ordered the Petite Fillet and of course added a Lobster Tail for an extra $15. Our waiter offered the Kids Menu for my daughter and a little steak fillet with mash and desert all comes out to $13.99 I thought that was good. My mom and I did the Wine pairing for an extra $16. My total bill was under $150 I thought that was pretty good. For dessert, I had the bread pudding which was delicious !

We ordered the burger sliders and beef tenderloin. Both items lacked flavor and, unfortunately, we were endlessly chewing on the bubble gum 'meat' until you gave up. I was very conscious of this but, yep, in the napkin it went. The only good appetizers we were pleased with were the BBQ buttered shrimp, Caesar salad and french fries.

Avoid the mint jelly though.  It reminded me of toothpaste.My date ordered the ribeye medium.  Med is a little too well done for me, but I still stole a piece from his plate.  Can't say it was absolutely outstanding nor was it horrible.  It was an average tasting piece of meat.We also ordered a side of mashed potatoes.  This was very tasty.  The date practically licked the serving bowl clean.All in all the dinner wasn't bad.  Compared to other steak houses, Ruth's Chris isn't that pricey, but I definitely feel like I can get much better steak elsewhere.",0,0,0,Jess C.,"Mount Vernon, NY",181,63,10

Swooped down on my cousin's cheesecake round. It was light, creamy and delicious. I was tempted to take one to go. My fried lobster salad was tasty but reminded me of something that I could probably get at the average Hibachi house as an appetizer. My aunt's lobster mac and cheese appetizer wasn't pretty. A mini-casserole dish of way too waxy and yellow pasta shells and barely there lobster. She barely took a bite before sending it back. Our waiter handled this very kindly and we weren't charged for it. Cool.

I'm not really a steak eater I'm more of a chicken ground turkey kind of person but I ordered that ribeye I must say that was the best most tender piece of meat I have eaten in years! Very flavorful, so flavorful  I ate the entire ribeye!!! Oh I almost forgot,  the sweet potato casserole was out of this world, amazingly, mouthwateringly DELICIOUS!!!!

4.0,10/31/2014,"I came to this restaurant on a friend's recommendation and was totally blown away by the food and the service. Being a restaurant, the setup wad good and the waiters were very friendly. I even had a short chat with one waiter over a common soccer team we supported.The place is very neat and clean. They changed table clothes each time a customer left the table. The menu is simple and self-explanatory. Wine collections were vast but unfortunately I did not tried any. Love the melted butter served along with the bread. Very soft and pleasant aroma to the taste.Food was served in an orderly manner. First the starter then followed by the main course followed by dessert. The corn chowder was fantastic. Creamy corn with crispy bacon strips and diced potatoes. The rib eye steak was fabulously cook and the portion is huge. 1 inch of 12lbs steak. I ordered medium rare steak and it was cook to almost perfection. The outside layer was crispy and the inside raw yet not too bloody. Not too sure what was used to cook it but the flavor was nicely blend. Best steak I have eaten by far.Now come the dessert. I cannot say much for the dessert as it was below par in my opinion for such equisite restaurant. The starter was good, main course was good but the dessert not that great. Not that it tasted bad but could have been better. Overall, it is a wonderful experience eating there.

2.0,10/30/2014,"Now 80% of this review is based on the service provided by the waiter. I will move on to the food afterwards. I am a person of color, and so was my female friend when we dined at this establishment. The waiter did not seem inviting at all and barely made eye contact with us when taking our order. He seemed disinterested in explaining the menu items to us and barely came to check on us. It was very very bad considering he price you are paying for the food, AND us noticing how he was responding to other patrons right next to us. He made our experience very uncomfortable, and so unenjoyable that I do not want to go back. I had the steak with two lobster tails, and she had the stuffed-roasted chicken. We shared the crab cakes and lobster mac and cheese. The steak was good, but I have had better at other steak houses. The lobster was very tender and succulent. Her chicken was juicy and flavorful, yet a tad too salty. The crabcakes were the best thing we ordered, but definitely skip the Mac and cheese -Waste of money. Again, maybe your experience may be better but I do not recommend this steak house, regardless of popularity and longevity in the city.

We ordered the Louisiana Seafood Gumbo. I thought it was pretty good with all that spice and definitely gives you a good taste of Southern-style! They're definitely not cheap with the shrimp, crab meat, and other seafoods in there! I got the Petite Filet 8 oz. as my entree in Medium-doneness. It was very flavorful and not once I needed to think about adding any seasonings or sauce at all! It was done the way I wanted! Any too bloody pieces, I just left it in the burning plate a little longer - very, very useful!Garlic Mashed Potatoes was an excellent choice! I love the garlic flavoring, it was not too overwhelming and just enough to give it a delicious taste to every bite!We ordered Creme Brulee that was not on the Restaurant Week menu. Again, this was an excellent choice! The dessert was amazing and it had that perfect layer of burnt sugar crust that I love breaking through with my spoon! Not to mention, it had a very pretty presentation!Service: Our service was a bit cold that evening otherwise they will be a perfect 5-Stars in my book. I see that they do complimentary birthday/anniversary dessert pretty often. It definitely makes it extra special for customers.

5.0,8/11/2014,"I am so happy i finally got to try this place without burning a hole in my wallet for amazing steak thanks to restaurant week nyc. The menu had great options, including salad for starters or gumbo or you can easily upgrade to fried calamari for an extra 6 bucks. Also we got to choose between a 6 oz filet or stuffed chicken with cheee or salmon or you can upgrade to a 16 ounce steak for an extra 15 bucks. I chose the 6 oz and calamari, oh my god the calamari was made with extremely good seasoning it was crispy to the point of perfection with freshly squeezed lemon and peppers were fried with the calamari giving it awesome flavor and the portion was generous. The cut of my steak was perfect seasoned with salt pepper and some oil too, it was juicy and thick and so soft the knife cuts so easily through it. My boyfriend got 16 ounces and he devoured his in a matter of minutes it was that good , his was also thick and juicy just how a steak should be. For drinks we got a blueberry mojito and a glass of pinot grigio ( they also had a deal of two wine glasses for 18 bucks) and the mojito was amazing not too strong and not too sweet. For our courses we got to choose sides including mashed potatoes with garlic or sweet potatoes baked in a casserole or mushrooms or creamed spinach or you can upgrade for extra to grilled shrimp or lobster tail. We ended up going with mashed potato and baked sweetpotato casserole, the casserole was a little too sweet for my taste since it had a hint or cinnamon but the texture was perfect. The mashed potatoes were creamy with a lot of flavor. For dessert it came with just one option of breadpudding with chocolate which  melted right in your mouth and it pairs great with the light pudding which had yummy raisins. Overall with drinks included the bill came out to 250 for 4 people which is reasonable for such a high quality restaurant. The waiters were super friendly and were able to seat us early and explained all items on the menu and even remember our names , I would definetly go back again for any occasion!",12,5,6,Michelle C.,"Brooklyn, NY",880,417,506
5.0,8/9/2014,"Had a friend trying Restaurant Week for the first time. Wanted it to be a good first one so chose Ruth's Chris over La Masseria (which is also around the Theater District location) solely based on their RW menu. Service was top, which was what I expected from a swanky steakhouse. Friend and I opted for the upgraded appetizers:  the fried calamari with sweet chili sauce & the seared ahi tuna. Worth the extra $$ in my opinion as the portions were big and the tuna was cooked perfectly. Tuna came in a light wasabi/soy glaze with a cucumber salad on the side. The pink pickled ""sushi"" ginger was also a nice touch. I got the petite filet and the creamed spinach, which I didn't regret, because by the end of my entree I was stuffed. Steak was cooked a perfect medium rare with delicious melted butter surrounding it. Friend got the salmon and loved it as well. Fish was seared on the outside but super tender and flaky on the inside. Wasn't dry at all. Dessert wasn't memorable but was tasty.

Came here with my boyfriend for lunch hour seeing as it was across the street from the firm, and it was a good choice. We were seated and served quickly, and the service was knowledgeable and kind (even if a tad bit pretentious). The bread and butter was really good. Bread was crusty on the outside and soft on the inside. The butter was wonderfully whipped. I got the prime French dip, which was really good. Meat was tender and juicy; bread was firm enough to hold the meat and the au jus but still soft enough to bite. The fries were also generously cut. He got the steak frites -- which came with a mountain of shoestring fries. The steak itself was swimming in delicious molten butter, and was cooked wonderfully rare and tender. The only suggestion would be for it to be a bit more charred on the outside (or maybe I just got spoiled by Peter Luger).

We made a reservation through my good old Yelp app and got to the restaurant exactly at the right time... We were greeted by a nice young man who said that out table is ready which was great. We were sat at a nice table and our waitress came to get our order. Considering that it was a restaurant week, i thought i should try their special. I ordered the filet with the house salad with sweet potato casserole.. My Fiance ordered the 16oz rib eye with the side of Their spinach and cheese side dish and a bottle of 2009 Pinot. First of all when the waitress came back with the bottle, my fiance noticed that it was not 2009, but it was a 2011. She mentioned that they were out of it or something... Just for the record, if you are out of a wine, you need to correct your menu. So that cost the restaurant one whole star, since they charge guests the price of a 2009 bottle but serve a 2011 bottle.Why did I deduct the second star? Since it was our anniversary night, I had mentioned it in my comments while making the reservation. So after dinner, the waitress was kind enough to bring us a cheesecake dessert along with some candles which was very nice. But remember that I had mentioned that I got the restaurant week special that included 3 courses! Umm, so what happend to my 3rd course??!!!! I didn't get served the bread pudding that I was promised and not to mention paid for.... These are the reasons I gave this place a 3 stars... Will I go back?

4.0,4/15/2014,"There is a reason Ruth Chris has built their brand to be a top notch steakhouse.  Yes, food and quality is easily the biggest part.  But they do many of the little things well... so in no particular order: menu explanation, wine knowledge, waiter recommendations and ease of service.  Ease of service is for me how you don't notice your table being clear or them cleaning the crumbs off.  It's done so well that you take it for granted.  Anyways, they are none for their steaks and of course they are incredible.  Their side dishes do not fall short either.  You expect to have excellent food at a pricey steakhouse, but a Ruth Chris you are confident that you will be satisfied.",1,0,0,Fabian C.,"Franklin Square, NY",227,287,147
5.0,4/12/2014,I don't know what to say!!! The best steak I have ever had!!!!! And that is saying a lot since my thing is steak and have had the best or so I thought. The filet was so moist and melted in my mouth. It was cooked medium well and seasoned perfectly. The side was mashed potatoes which were good. For desert there was a bread pudding which was average. The restaurant itself is very nice...it should be for the prices!!! I was surprised at how big it actually is. Not sure if there was a bar or not. Service was average. Nice diverse crowd which was cool for a Friday evening.  On to my next steak house!!! You absolutely have to make a reservation especially on a Friday evening.

I came here at happy hour time, but I really just came to get dinner with my mom because we had a gift card. Service was fantastic and the staff was super friendly. All and all... the food is good, but NOT WORTH THE PRICE AT ALL. The potato au gratin tasted and looked like it came from a TGI Fridays. Same thing with the creamed spinach. They just were not quality meals. The thing we liked the most was the spicy lobster in a little cream sauce. Very good. Very small portions, but then again it was lobster. This was the best dish we had, and it was on the happy hour menu for $7! We got sliders as well which were pretty good. I did enjoy the flavor of the meat, but they were nothing to ride home about. The asian flare calamari was good, but not great as well. Just tasted like it was missing something, and they were a bit too oily for my taste.

We started with the gumbo, which was pretty good and finished it pretty quickly. The 8oz. filet came, which I ordered with creamed spinach and both were excellent. The steak was a no frills type, just salt, pepper and butter and was nice and tender, ordered medium rare of course. The plate came sizzling hot and sometimes I would put the soft butter that was for the bread on each steak bite. Yom. I tried my friends mashed potatoes, which I felt was perfectly seasoned. Creamed spinach was good too, I never had bad creamed spinach honestly...Wouldn't want to experience that anyway!  The dessert I felt was lacking. I did prefer the chocolate cake over the bread pudding and my friend was nice enough to switch with me. I'm used to having a more fluffy and light, moist bread pudding. There's was very dense. I would recommend this place for something that you know will turn out fine, but not for something that you will go crazy over.

3.0,3/1/2014,"We came to try this steakhouse in the heart of Midtown in the spirit of Restaurant Week, and we were sadly let down. Nothing glaringly bad, but once again, nothing too spectacular either.Appetizer: I ordered the Seafood Gumbo soup, while my boyfriend ordered the Calamari ($5 extra charge). Both were delicious; the gumbo was hearty and light at the same time, while the calamari was perfectly crispy without being too battered. Its Asian chili sauce complemented the calamari wonderfully. The first course, sad to say, was probably the best course in our meal. Entree: I ordered the 8 oz filet while my boyfriend had the 16 oz NY ribeye steak, both cooked medium well. When the dishes came out, it was piping hot, complete with the sizzling juices on the plates. My filet was very enjoyable; each bite was so soft and juicy. However, my bf's steak came out slightly dry and he found it to be bland. I guess it depends on the size. Our sides were sauteed mushrooms (which is one of my favorite dishes to order at steakhouses) and garlic mashed potatoes. The mashed potatoes were creamy and delicious, but it's hard to mess up mashed potatoes. However, the mushrooms were very flavorless and not what I expected at all. Dessert: After 15 minutes of waiting, our waiter finally came over and simply said: ""I'm guessing you guys want one of each? One bread pudding and one chocolate cake?"" We weren't even offered the dessert menu or given any other options. Dessert came out shortly after, and sadly enough, my favorite part of both desserts was the berries and creme. My boyfriend hardly touched either. All in all, our experience here wasn't really worth the money spent. Our waiter, I believe his name is Laz, hardly seemed friendly and looked annoyed to be serving us. He was looking away while we were talking to him and didn't bother responding to what we had to say. Even the bussers and other waiters seemed to be more attentive than him.

2.0,2/24/2014,"This is a review for restaurant week. Truthfully, I was pretty disappointed. We weren't seated in the main dining area. Instead, we were brought to a corner where all the waiters were doing their work, so it wasn't an ideal spot, and I thought that corner was too dark. The filet mignon had a nice taste but was a bit burnt and I thought it was too tough for medium. The dessert was not that great either. I had the chocolate sin cake, but it tasted more like fudge rather than cake. Even the bread pudding was so-so. Now for the service. I thought our waiter was pretty snobby - most probably never going back again. I went to Capital Grille at the Chrysler Center during the summer and that was a wonderful experience, and they were much busier that day too than they were at Ruth's Chris the night I went, and the service was super. Our waiter was so attentive and nice there. Also, I don't know they just gave us one piece of bread when there are three of us. All the restaurants that I've been to for Restaurant Week gave everyone a piece of their own bread.

1.0,12/28/2013,"This is the worst most god awful restaurant I have ever eaten at in my life.  I am writing this review while still in the middle of battling the worst case of food poisoning I have ever had.  My wife and i ate there this past Thursday night and i should have left as soon as we sat down when the guy that served our water had the most off putting stench of body odor emanating from his pit stained armpits.  I then proceeded to take the waiters word for it and order the 54 dollar ""best steak in the world"" cowboy ribeye (btw this is expensive even by NYC standards).  The steak was comparable to a USDA choice ribeye that I could have cooked myself and they seemed to try to make up for the lack of quality and taste by drowning it in a disgusting amount of butter.  I ordered medium rare which is how I have ordered every steak in my life and upon my first cut into the steak it seemed close enough so didn't warrant any need to send it back.  However, as I got closer to the bone the meat became so rare that it took on a gelatinous purple color.  This is a sure sign the meat had been frozen and not fully defrosted before beginning to cook.  What kind of reputable steakhouse does that?...at that point I had eaten most of the steak so didn't want to attempt to send it back, we were late for a movie anyway.  I simply chose to stop eating.  I guess I might as well mention the sides, we had a watery creamed spinach and a lobster mac n cheese that had that fake cheesy taste like it came out of a box of Kraft.  The whole meal gave me the sense of a glorified TGI Friday""s, but that wouldn't be fair to TGI Friday's.  We left utterly disappointed with a 200 dollar meal and decided to forget about it and enjoy the movie.  By the end of the flick I had a slightly queasy feeling in my stomach but thought nothing of it and returned home to bed.  I was asleep for maybe 4 hours when I suddenly woke up in a cold sweat and horrendous stomach pains. Needless to say, I had to miss work and 36 hours later I am still dragging myself to the bathroom every 15 minutes.  I have eaten in some dodgy places before and paid the price for it but this is the single most horrible bout of food poisoning I have ever had.  It makes you wonder just how dirty it must be in the kitchen and how poor their quality control must be.  Please head my WARNING and do not eat at this disease infested chain restaurant, there are so many REAL steakhouses in New York that there is no point in downgrading yourself.  The only reason we went to this place is because we received a gift card from the holidays.  This place is a poor excuse for a steakhouse imitation and obviously does not care about the health and well being of its customers.  I feel like I have been attacked and paid 200 dollars only to become horribly sick.  I will need to go to the doctor if this continues much longer.  If I could bring them up on criminal charges I would.",0,1,0,Ryan M.,"Manhattan, NY",0,2,0

2.0,12/1/2013,"Let me start off by saying the staff at this location is terrific...  Everyone is friendly and the service is very attentive.  However, the problem with Ruth's Chris is that there's a lot of room for improvement.  For example, my steaks are either overcooked or undercooked, and I have yet to come across any steak that was ""melt in your mouth tender.""  There really is no ""wow"" factor to this place, with exception to the smell of burning butter that your clothes will absorb.  The only reason why I go to Ruth's Chris is due to the insistence of coworkers who come in from out of town.  I've also been to a few other locations outside of NYC, and it seems to be the same everywhere.  The only difference is that the NYC location is fairly busy while in other cities like Atlanta, Ft. Lauderdale, and Boca Raton, the locations there are fairly empty and easy to get into without a reservation and without a wait.",6,5,5,Jaszon S.,"Westchester County, NY",948,224,182

5.0,11/11/2013,"My first Ruth Chris experience was in Puerto Rico on vacation with my BFF. And I only happened to stumbled onto that one because I wanted to see what their lunch specials were and saw they had Happy Hour! I will say after that experience, I was hooked and now I'm on a hunt to try every Ruth Chris' Happy Hour.I love it when expensive restaurants think about the little people and provide us with the opportunity to dine at their establishment with more affordable bites and drinks! THANK YOU Ruth Chris for thinking about us! So I can only talk about my experience during Happy Hour in the bar area. Happy hour in Manhattan is only from 430-630pm, so hurry and rush out of work! Their bites are $8 not the usual advertised $7 Sizzle, Swizzle, Swirl Happy Hour, but eating and drinking in the city you become use to the factor that we are on our pay system, I mean we don't even have dollar menus in the city! And I digress... AtmosphereThe dark wood paneled walls made it look regal like back in the day when real men drank whiskey and scotch and when women actually acted like ladies. I loved that their bar area has multiple tables so I don't think it will be too hard to get a table and we came on a Thursday. ServiceThe waitress was very nice and accommodating, although I feel like she had the whole bar area and was a bit swamped. Either way she was able to get us our refills and all the dishes we wanted to try before the end of happy hour. The busser that was on the floor tried his best in trying to help her.What We AteSeared Ahi Tuna: My absolutely favorite dish of the Happy Hour Menu! Blacken Ahi tuna with a spicy mustard sauce; it was so fresh and tender. I loved it, we almost got to orders!Barbecued Shrimp: Large shrimp cooked in BBQ butter, they were very good, large in size and well-cooked not chewy at all.Tenderloin Skewers: My second favorite dish, the tenderloins were so tender, and the sesame soy sauce over the greens made it feel high end and fresh with the right amount of steak!Filet Sliders: The filets itself were very good, I can't wait to try their filet, but the rolls they used were for big for the meat. Spicy Lobster: It reminds me of General Tos Chicken the way it's lightly fried and tossed in a spicy cream sauce. I remember loving this in Puerto Rico but I wasn't too much of a fan in NYC. It's still very good, if you like lobster give it a try!Side of Fries: There side of fries are large, well worth $5, they are a little like Broadway fries but better because they are crispy and tossed with a little of garlic.What I DrankMoscow Mule: very light and refreshing, tastes like a cross between a margarita and ginger ale! Loved it, I think it's going to be my new favorite drink during my outings! If you're in the Times Square area and off of work early I would definitely suggest trying out their Happy Hour and if you ball like that have dinner afterwards! I can't wait until I get to actually go there for dinner; I know it will be so delicious!! Until next time Ruth Chris!",2,0,0,Allison S.,"West New York, NJ",150,271,884

4.0,9/29/2013,"In honor of my husband's birthday we had dinner at Ruth's Chris last night. Seeing as I don't eat meat I took one for the team. I suppose it was the least I could for his birthday.The Good:* My husband and daughter ate every bite of their steaks. I believe he had a Petite Filet and she the 6 oz. filet with shrimp. She's 8. She ate the entire thing. That says a whole lot.* I had the shrimp cocktail, which was delicious. Sounds simple but most restaurants do not execute this week. I wasn't thrilled with the presentation (why no cocktail glass?) but it was tasty.* We shared the steamed broccoli (my choice) and the mashed potatoes (their choice). The latter was way too buttery for me and needed salt. They seemed happy with it though.* My husband tore through the Chocolate Explosion like someone was going to pull it away from him at any second. It was a bit scary. But apparently it was THAT good.The Not-So-Good:* Service was spotty. Initially it was speedy and efficient but when it came time for dessert / the check, our server was nowhere to be found.* Complimentary birthday dessert (which we did not ask for but was kind of RC to provide) was not very good. An ice cream / cookie / cheesecake combination. So confusing. The cookie was dry and bland, the cheesecake a strange mix of creme brulee? Even my 8-year-old sugar addict stuck to the ice cream* The complimentary bread was a disappointment...a bit stale and too crumbly. RC should consider doing bread rolls instead. (Preferably sourdough!)The Bottom Line: For the prices this place charges I'd like to see something a bit closer to perfection. In any case, we'll be coming back here, mostly because my husband is all over it.

At ~$40 ($5 off if you use Foursquare check-in linked to your AmEx!), don't really think other cuisines are worth it since they're typically not serving you cream of the crop food.Ruth's Chris is phenomenal - BIG portions, LARGE calamari, GINORMOUS steak, HUGE creamed spinach side, PHAT dessert, GREAT value. (almost needed to grab a thesaurus toward the end...)Calamari appetizer ($5 extra I believe...) - Super generous portions, crispy and fresh. This could actually be a meal in itself. Glazed sweet chili flavoring was just right!Filet mignon main course - I'm not the hugest fan of filet mignon because I feel like it's too mushy and not meaty enough...I'd much prefer ribeyes, but the filet mignon here is fantastic and bursting with flavor!Creamed spinach side - Just right in terms of viscosity and cheesiness. Wasn't watered down, and you could taste the spinach without it being overbearingly dairy-filled!I forgot what the dessert was...but it was pretty phat. And I'm a huge dessert snob =)Love this place!

Symphony dessert means you get both, no choosing needed!)Meal breakdown:Appetizer- I got the arugula/goat cheese salad. Delicious, and the vinigrette was just right. I'm generally not a big fan of goat cheese, but this did not overpower the meal, had a smooth after-taste and just complemented the salad. BF enjoyed his gumbo, although I found it a bit too salty for my liking.Main entree-we both got Rib-eye, a rare 12oz for me whereas he paid the $4 extra for a full pound of rare meat. These delicious slabs of meat comes out on what's said to be 500-degree plates, and are only cooked with butter, pepper and salt. The entire night was a delicious sizzle although I would've liked my steak a bit more rare. BF's was cooked to perfection, whereas my sides/ends were closer to medium-rare vs that full rare. Sides- I opted for the mac & cheese (nice staple, had hints of jalapeno for a mild kick) and BF got the creamed spinach (creamy, delicious, albeit a bit thin in places. Much prefer the truffle spinach from Strip house, but this is a nice touch)Dessert- YES. Symphony dessert. While ordering, I was very pleased to hear prefix means you get both. So glad that I need to mention it again. This consisted of a small pudding-like cheesecake brulee and a small, warm chocolate walnut cookie. When paired together, I heard angels singing in the background.

In other words, tooooo much misses dash. it was eatable but i had to keep drinking water.-Shrimp- ExcellentThe deserts were great. It is virtually impossible to mess up desert.

I sound like I may have an unhealthy relationship with food, but really, I don't. Ruth's Chris is usually my place of choice for good steak. It's definitely on the pricey side but well worth it.  The place is huge. Very dark and somber. Definitely suitable for a romantic date or business dinner.The service is excellent. We had to bring our toddler at the last minute so were running late. The hostess was very understanding and was still able to seat us right away even though we were more than 15 minutes late. Our waiter was very nice. He also had a 15 month old so we traded a few stories. This definitely made us less uncomfortable at being the only couple with a child in tow. The food is great. I always get the petit filet, medium well, and my husband always gets the strip medium rare (shudders). Calamari is also a must every time we go. For sides we get the creamed spinach and mac and cheese. I was not a fan of the calamari this time around (wayyy to sweet). The steaks and the creamed spinach were just as delicious as I remembered from previous visits. It was my first time having the mac and cheese and it was pretty damn good. My toddler could not get enough of it. Although this place is not kid friendly, it's not the end of the world if you do bring your kid. They have high chairs, which is really the most important thing.

It's exactly what I had hoped for in terms of food, service and atmosphere and my parents both enjoyed their experience too.The restaurant is huge and wasn't too packed when we walked in, so I was slightly concerned. Maybe the trendier steakhouses that have popped up in the last several year are taking a bite into their business? Thankfully, the entire meal was great so I highly recommend this place if you're looking for delicious food in an old fashioned steakhouse.For mains, my parents went with the classics, ribeye and filet, and I decided to try the crab cakes (hope this doesn't take away from the credibility of my review ;). Both the ribeye and filet were really tender and cooked to our specs. I was also a big fan of the steamed broccoli and baby spinach sides. My crab cakes were delicious and super filling. We ended up just sharing our plates and all enjoyed the 3 dishes. We were attended on by two young servers, both of whom were extremely polite and kept wishing my dad happy father's day. In fact, they even gave him a father's day card and a gift certificate at the end of the meal.My one slight compliant that took away half a star from this review is the bread.

4.0,3/12/2013,"Definitely an upgrade to Outback and Longhorn type steak house.  You can tell the meat is not some glued together meat that some of the chain steakhouses are using.The only thing is the sides are so heavy on butter and salt.  Not a place to go if you're health conscious.The steaks are usually thick, they're known for juicy steaks and the season it with butter + salt/pepper.  As some other reviews have mentioned, most of the food is very oily and greasy but it's all good because you are at a steakhouse.Desserts are very good, not over the top variety but solid choices such as cheesecakes, ice cream, creme brulee was pretty good.Not a good place to take a date because the tables are usually so close, you hardly get any privacy.",0,0,0,Kevin H.,"Union, NJ",13,99,40

3.0,2/7/2013,"what I ate: Restaurant Week menu selection of salad, filet, mashed potatoes, chocolate cakeCame here for restaurant week to make sure i get my fill of delicious steak before RW ends on Friday. The food breakdown:salad- ehhh. really really basic. i only ordered because with all the butter i knew was coming i wanted to skip on the rich bisque option. wouldnt order off the regular menu. filet- i ordered mine medium rare +. it came out pretty rare. it was a really thick cut of steak so the exterior had a nice sear but the majority of the inside was rare (cold, dark red). i would have actually sent it back to have them to either redo or even butterfly and quickly sear but i couldnt get a hold of my server. so instead i did my own version using the hot plate they serve the meat on. it ended up still being really tasty and buttery but would have been better if cooked more to my liking. mashed potatoes were good and buttery. chocolate cake. good. very sweet. had more of a mass market chain look to it but still tasted good. service - super friendly but hard to get their attention at times. also long gap between my steak and my dessert so i asked for my check to come along with my cake so i could make my post lunch meeting on time. All in all I would recommend this place for RW, happy hour, or maybe a work lunch. but based on the location and minor issues with my food and service i wouldnt come back for dinner.",0,0,0,Christina H.,"Manhattan, NY",54,533,110
5.0,2/6/2013,Came here last night for dinner with a friend before seeing Cinderella on Broadway (I'm a girlie girl... don't judge me)... Ordered from the Restaurant Week menu as I'm one of the downtrodden who wouldn't be able to set foot inside otherwise.Ambience - Gorgeous. Looks like what a steak house should look and was everything I imagined it would beWaitress - Diane. She was awesome. Thought my friend was hilarious and was very attentive and able to explain everything and made great recommendations. Next time I come back I will have to request her section.Food: Really really good.... good enough I'd actually scrape and save for a month to come back here and eat at regular prices...My friend ordered the House Salad (he said it was OK and not amazing but that's how I feel about most salads personally)... Salmon (which was very very good. Cooked & seasoned perfectly)... Creamed Spinach (somebody said it tasted previously frozen in the reviews and I have to disagree. This was some of the best Creamed Spinach I've ever had and I'm a personal fan of the frozen Boston Market kind so maybe i'm prejudiced)... and Garlic Mashed Potatoes (again... really good. creamy. right amount of garlic flavor. Not super stiff but not runny either which I hate. I wanted mashed potatoes not potato soup)I had the Petit Filet cooked Medium... Absolutely amazing. Hands down best steak I've ever had. I also got the bleu cheese crust which I honestly could of done without because the flavor of the steak almost overpowered the bleu cheese. Plus the ton of butter that's on the plate and just yumm... I'm salivating thinking about it.I also got the Sweet Potato Casserole... it was really good but maybe a tiny bit too sweet as I almost didn't want dessert because I feel like my sweet quota was already used for the day.Chocolate Molten Cake was really decadent and rich and the ice cream was also creamy and rich. A nice finish to the meal.My friend also got some Grapefruit cocktail which he said was awesome.Total price came to about $110 + tip (the cocktail alone was $19 and our extra side dish was $9.50) so come in prepared to have a minor heart attack when you see the bill but that's to be expected if you know anything about this place.All in all like I said I can't wait to go again and only wish I had the means to make it to lunch service before Restaurant Week ends... maybe next year,3,0,1,Betty W.,"Newark, NJ",206,71,9

The Restaurant has the coziness and look of a 1890's mansion. Lobster Bisque:A light soup with lots of lobster flavor with a few pieces of lobster inside.Steak House Salad:A bitter salad with half cherry cut tomato strategically placed around on the edges of the dish.6 oz. Petite Filet (rare):The butter still sizzles when the plate reaches the table. The Filet was so tender and the outside was perfectly seasoned. I would cut my steak and sometimes press it against the butter and it would still sizzle. This is one of my favorite steaks I've ever had. Creamed Spinach:I wish there was more Spinach than cream but regardless very delicious. So creamy I feel like I need bread with this side dish.Sweet Potato Casserole:This dish is money. Perfectly baked crunchy pecans and breading on the outside protecting and insulating the sweet potato. Chocolate Molten Cake with Ice Cream:Cake consistently moist through the whole cake.Bread Pudding with Whiskey Sauce:Whiskey sauce is really strong and really good, the bread putting seemed dry and seemed like it was sitting out (was served room temperature).The service was very straightforward and the food came out very very fast. The table in front had a group and the server was checking for how much they tip right at the table left. I thought he could have waited until he was at the register.

This review is for both visits. Overall, the food was so good. I had the Lobster Bisque for lunch and the calamari for dinner. The calamari was crispy and good and the spicy Asian chili sauce was amazing (please note: it is not spicy at all - down 1/2 star). Both times I ordered the stuff chicken breast. It was so good. The garlic herb cheese was so good. I wonder how they put the cheese inside the chicken (says the non-cooker)? Dessert --- OOHHHH!! WOW! I had the Chocolate Molten Cake with Ice Cream. Owwwww.

Yes, I was a bit annoyed by that, but it was not a deal breaker.The service was impeccable, which is even nicer considering that we had the prix-fixe lunch menu. To start we had the salad choice and barbecue shrimp. We shared both and I preferred the salad. The shrimp was good, but the salad was better.We had spinach, mushrooms and mashed potatoes as our side choices. One of these was not on the prix-fixe menu but my mom wanted it, and since she was paying, she got want she wanted (at an additional charge of course). we both had the petit fliet steak on the 500 degree plate, cooked medium and had no complaints.The food was good - the complimentary bread was great, the price was right and we were very pleased with the service.

My 60 year old parents came 2 hours on the train to have dinner in the city. The service was so rushed that it was embarrassing. A three course meal was shoved down our throats in 60 minutes. Our appetizer was brought out less than 4 minutes after we ordered it, while we were still enjoying our pre-dinner cocktails. The wine was poured before we finished our drinks, and his birthday cake was brought out while we were still finishing dinner (the plates were being cleared as the birthday cake came out). We have eaten at quite possibly the finest restaurants in the city, but for whatever reason my father feels loyal to your establishment. I was saddened by the service. For a $300 meal, this is NOT the type of service that I would expect.

This wasnt bad but the lobby wasnt exactly that nice of a place to be waiting. Eventually we were allowed to go upstairs.The service throughout the seminar was very good with water always refilled on the tables, extra bread brought out when requested, and they even made me an iced coffee - yay! (Had to keep away somehow.)Now for a review of the meal:- Steak House Salad w/ Balsamic Vinaigrette: This was pretty good, even though I generally dont like the dressing premixed. The greens were a bit better quality than that given at most fancy steak houses and the croutons were crunchy and not stale.- 6-one Filet: A bit disappointed that this was served on a plate filled with butter/oil. Like steak doesnt have enough fat already! I removed my filet onto an extra plate and drained it a bit. It was well peppered and salted at least and made medium just as I had asked. This was served with mashed potatoes and creamed spinach. They brought 3 small servings out of each for the table. The mashed potatoes were a bit too creamy for my tastes and didnt include the skins. Thusly, a bit bland. The creamed spinach was more like a dip and chips would have been well suited! Honestly, way way too creamy. I suppose this part of the meal was just a big pile of fat, no wonder it tasted good.- Mini Cheesecake with Fresh Seasonal Berries with Sweet Cream: Took the cream off with a fork seeing how unhealthy the previous course had been and ate the 3 berries that were on the plate. The mini cheesecake I was not impressed with and looked/tasted like it had been purchased externally instead of house-made.

5.0,8/7/2012,"Of all the Ruth's Chris' locations I've been to, this one had the best food and the best service.  Lost a star, though I wish I could only deduct HALF a star, on ambience.  It was a bit hot inside and I was seated under a high hat.  I felt a bit like I had a spotlight on me.  I asked the waiter if the lights were on a dimmer because it wasn't helping how warm I was, he was happy to dim the lights for me, but I was still looking for it to be a bit dimmer for a special evening with my boyfriend.However, in the theatre district, I didn't see a lot of couples, more small groups and professionals, so maybe that kind of ambience is not aligned to their core clientele.  Which is fine.Everyone we came in contact with was cordial and clearly made us feel like valued clienteloe.  The service was excellent, prompt but not aggressive and paced exactly how I like.  I hate when courses arrive on top of each other and sometimes that is a challenge and food whinds up sitting in the window while a table finishes the prior course.  Then the food dies a bit, less juicy, overcooks, etc.  Not at allt he case here.  Our waiter read our pacing needs and hit it out of the park.Food was outstanding.  For starters we had crabcakes and crab stuffed mushrooms.  I'm  suck for stuffed mushrooms so, for me, they can never be bad.  The crabcakes was flaky, fresh crabmeat perfectly seasoned served without any sauce which was perfect - didn't detract from the pure taste.  For soup/salad course we had lobster bisque and wedge salad.  Again, I love a wedge salad, hard to not make me happy here.  But I really noticed how freshly cooked the bacon seemed.  There wasn't too much in quantity but the flavor was excellent and the blue cheese dressing outstanding.For dinner, a porterhouse for two.  Excellent.  Perfectly cooked and wonderfully seasoned.  Great presentation.  With the porterhouse they bring two side plate that are heated with extra juice and seasoning from the steak sizzing on the hot empty plate.  The food runner then serves one piece of filet and one piece of strip onto your plate and tosses it in the hot juice and seasoning.  You see it cook just a bit more right in front of your eyes, only on the outside, doesn't sacrifice the cook temperature at all.  I feel this approach really added to the overall experience, taste of the food and overall savory flavor of the meat.All in all an excellent night out.  Reservations were easily made on OpenTable.com.Ask for Alex.  He was great and well informed on wine.",0,0,1,Jennifer P.,"Highlands, NJ",286,29,13

Don't believe the hype.The decor was nice though I must say, it often is at steakhouses. They all have those olden day cigar-bar-lounge feels which I love but the food was far from spectacular here. This was another Restaurant Week try-out (the best time to sample all the steak restaurants as I am a very avid steak eater, I love love loveee my steak and potatoes!)... but not from here. Most certainly NOT from here. Upon realizing that we were merely there for RW, our waiter's entire friendly dismeanor changed; he seemed almost annoyed by our presence. The appetizer was mediocre. Bf's calamari was pretty good though i seriously question why they kind of asian-fusioned the calamari. Kind of bizarre for a steakhouse in my opinion. My lobster bisque was alright. No complaints.The entrees were where it just went down hill, like wayyyyyy down hill. We both ordered the filet mignon. Bf's had a lot of fatty pieces and mine was super chewy. They were cooked to perfection, yes but i think it more the quality of the meat over anything else. When the maitre d came by to check on us, we told him and although friendly, his response was ""it's suppose to be chewy,"" which I honestly find to be a load of bull manure. Clearly he doesn't know who he's talking to, I may look to be a small girl but i eat ALOT of steak, I've had practically every filet mignon in every restaurant in the city and to be quite honest, Outback dolls out better steak than this place. Now Outback may not cook to perfection all the time as they tend to overcook but even overcooked, it's not as chewy as this place. VERY disappointing.The entrees were accompanied by two sides. We got the mashed potatoes and the creamed spinach. Now here is the highlight of the evening... GREAT mashed potatoes! The creamed spinach was just alright. I guess i'm not much of a creamed spinach eater so that could just be preference but the potatoes really were amazing. Best part of the meal. We ended with coffee and desserts: the chocolate mousse cheesecake and the bread pudding. The chocolate mousse cheesecake was good, the bread pudding was just a bad choice on my part since i hate cinnamon (and i've never had bread pudding before and decided to order it just to see what it was). Having not known what i was ordering, i cannot really say anything positive or negative about the bread pudding. All in all, even with the restaurant week deal, i seriously felt like i got ripped off coming here. $35pp really was too much for sub-par food. i could've struck a better deal at my neighborhood Outback and with better quality.",1,0,0,helen c.,"Manhattan, NY",2,11,0
4.0,8/2/2012,"4.5 stars.. :) I actually almost gave 5 stars.. but my review are just purely based on Restaurant week menu..So start of.. I didn't see that there is an additional charge for calamari.. So only the lobster bisque is included in the appetizer without additional charge.. We both ordered the soup and the calamari.. OMG.. the portion is so huge.. especially the calamari.. To be honest.. I think we can even share it.. Calamari is really good.. dip fried with some sweet chili.. a little spicy and it's crunchy.. I dislike fried food but I actually love the calamari..Everyone is talking about the chicken and the fillet.. But I really don't see a point coming into a steakhouse and order a chicken.. so we both ordered steak.. I have it medium and my friend had it medium well.. I had it medium because I wanna enjoy it with my wine.. BEWARE of the plate.. it's 300 degrees.. lol.. It is really hot.. and I get to enjoy a really hot steak till the end.. The petite fillet was really good with no extra words.. I am not a ""steak"" person so I don't really know what ""good"" steak means.. just 8oz and I was bloated.. SIDES.. creamy spinach and sweet potato casserole.. OMG... You have to order the sweet potato casserole.. That's probably my favorite part of the meal.. lol.. I told myself not to eat so much but I end up finish almost everything.. but I did not because I wanna save room for desserts..Desserts were not that great.. the bread pudding with whiskey sauce was really soft as if as it soak in the condense milk for a really long time... the mousse cake was not my favorite either.. so I think dessert experience was pretty bad here.. Service was EXCELLENT.. I heard ppl were complaining actually.. but I have no problem with them.. the manager came and asked how's our meal and we told them that the entree came out way too fast and there was no time for us to digest our appetizer.. our entree came out before we finished our appetizer actually.. It kinda ""spoilt"" the mood to enjoy in a high end restaurant.. I ordered the wine pairing and there wasn't enough time for me to enjoy.. So the manager apologize to us and said that they actually had problem with the timing.. so he came and asked us how do we like the wine.. and SURPRISE!! He brought us 2 glasses of our favorite wine for FREE!! :D how nice!! He asked us to enjoy our glass of wine and only tell them when we are ready for desserts.. One complain.. I think they should modify the restaurant week menu.. it's not worth it if you add 5 dollars for the calamari/mushroom and 15 dollars for the dry aged steak.. it will end up the same price as the original menu.. I would say.. bad menu but great food.. :) I wish there is more steak option without additional charge..",1,1,1,Shing Yiing O.,"Manhattan, NY",384,624,603
4.0,7/30/2012,"i am a pescatarian (i.e. i eat fish, but not meat), so the thought of a nice steak house doesn't really get me too hot 'n bothered. but i was dragged here on Friday night, and was pleasantly surprised. it was restaurant week, so i went with the 3 course tasting menu--salad, salmon with a side of sauteed mushrooms, and bread pudding. all were delicious. i also had a glass of the Chablis, which paired well with my meal. my dining companion had some sort of steak that was NOT on the restaurant week menu (sorry, i'm not a steakologist--it just looked like a big slab of meat to me) which he said was one of the best, if not THE best steaks he has ever had. he even spent a good 3-5 minutes trying to convince me to try a piece (see pescatrian comment above), which i didn't, but i believed him.the actual space is dark and formal, and quite large (lots of different dining rooms)/easy to get lost in (or maybe i'm just a moron). the service was great/attentive. overall, we had a good experience here.",6,5,3,Melissa F.,"Upper East Side, Manhattan, NY",144,323,14

I ordered the ribeye steak - medium rare and they definitely know what medium rare is. I dislike a place where you ask for medium rare but makes it look like well done with a slight of pink in the middle. It just makes the meat a bit chewy and dry. We ordered two side dishes to share: mash potatoes and asparagus. I have no complaints on the side dishes. The only thing I would change about the meal is the meat...it was a bit salty. Less on the salt and it would of been perfect. After dinner, we went to the bar and had a shot of Hennessy VSOP. A bar with VSOP Hennessy is always a plus.

After a coworker suggested trying Ruth Chris for happy hour on a Tuesday evening FOR HIS BIRTHDAY, about 12 people walked over and sat at a table in the bar area for drinks and appetizers. The apps ordered were decent, the fried calamari was not nearly as good a Bobby Vans, and the red wine was borderline offensive. After our charming waiter MATT had asked us if anyone needed a drink (towards the end of happy hour) he demanded to see all glasses to make sure they were not full.

4.0,6/17/2012,"The steaks were good: tender, well seasoned, and a slight gamey flavor that was JUST the right amount - enough to remind you that you were eating a quality piece of meat, but not too much to the point where you feel like you are licking the peri-anal area of a barnyard animal. Downside? They overcooked both of our steaks; I ordered a 12oz strip, medium rare, which was surprisingly thick for a small portion. It was medium in parts, medium well in others, and medium rare in other parts. UNEVEN! Hey - what can you do - it was lunch in midtown. My buddy ordered the petite filet with shrimp, medium, and it was medium well to fully well. What a shame. The meat was good though, so I am only taking off three points. Butter. BUTTER is the secret here. Everything is soaked in it. ON MY SECOND TRIP HERE I ordered the ribeye and the fat cap on it was delicious. The cut was nice and gamey from the aging process, just like last time. There was a strip or two that I couldn't eat, but for the most part this was a great experience. My wife loved the flavor too.

5.0,1/28/2012,"The bf and I finished watching Chinglish around late the other night and were both starving. It was raining out and freezing. Ruth's Chris was nearby and a friend of mine had raved about her experience there the week before, so I wanted to give it a try. I was able to make instant reservations on OpenTable, and we walked over there. We were seated within a few mins, and since it was pretty late, it wasn't too crowded. The lighting was great -- very warm and slightly romantic, and we were seated far enough from other diners that we were comfortable, but not isolated. We were given a loaf of bread and the softest whipped butter. The butter was very good, but the bread was nothing out of the ordinary. Since I was hungry though, I stuffed myself with the bread.We ordered from the Restaurant Week menu, which was pretty easy since there weren't too many options to choose from (2 apps, 3 entrees, 2 sides, and 1 dessert). Since the bf was very hungry, he wanted to get an appetizer from the regular menu as well. This was tough, since everything sounded so good. We narrowed it down to the crabcakes or the bbq shrimp, and ended up choosing the shrimp.The shrimp.. AMAZING. I can safely say it's the BEST SHRIMP I'VE EVER HAD. It was so fresh, and cooked so perfectly, and just the perfect texture. I was very sad that there were only 5, but they were decent-sized. The sauce it sat in -- a buttery-garlic sauce -- amazing! I wish I had pasta to throw in there. After we finished the shrimp, we used our bread to soak up as much of the sauce as we could. Seriously, amazing sauce -- I would've licked the plate clean if there weren't people around! The appetizer also came with a piece of garlic bread, which was ok. Not as great of an idea to dip the garlic bread in the sauce as well, since it was salty together.For appetizers, we both got the soup since we were trying to defrost from the cold. The soup took a little longer to come out than we would've liked, especially since we were so hungry. It was a hearty-sized bowl of tomato soup with chunks of assorted vegetables. I'm more a fan of a cream-based soups, but the soup was very fresh and good. I started getting full, since from all the bread and the shrimp, so I only finished 1/2 my soup. I didn't want to get so full that I couldn't eat my entree. The bf thought the soup was very good as well.For entrees, I got the petit filet, medium well, and the bf got the stuffed double chicken breast. I was very amused by the 500-degree plates on which they were served -- the dishes literally came out sizzling!. My filet was cooked perfectly. I usually like my steak more well-done, so I was able to cut slices of the filet, lay them flat on the hot plate, and cook them to my desired doneness. (I got it done med-well so the bf could have some too.) The seasoning was good, and I was able to enjoy it without adding any additional sauce. The bf's chicken breast was amazing. It was a very nice portion, especially for a restaurant week dinner -- since it was a double breast. It did look very funny on the plate (heart-shaped with two drumsticks on either side). He LOVED it. While my bf will eat anything, he's usually not too easily impressed by food.. but he RAVED about the chicken. The cheese oozed out of the breast when you cut it, and tasted wonderfully. The chicken was cooked perfectly, so not too dry, which is a problem we usually have when we order chicken.We had a choice of sides, and we got the mashed potatoes and the spinach. Both were amazing as well. My bf liked the mash more, since he's not too big a fan of creamed spinach. I wish I hadn't been so full at this point since I would've definitely devoured them both.For dessert, the only option was the chocolate cheesecake. It was decent sized, like a small cheesecake cupcake. It had chocolate sauce drizzled on top, and was dusted with powdered sugar. I was stuffed by this point, so I just had a bite of my bf's piece, lusciously dark and rich. I took my piece to go. We noticed that another couple near us was able to wrap up various parts of their RW meal.) I thought it was very cool that Ruth's Chris lets you take it to go, since I'm sure many other restaurants would say no since it's RW.Overall, an amazing experience. Made the earlier craziness of the night much better (we had been late for Chinglish since we were crazy enough to drive to the Theater District and try to look for street parking). The food was amazing, the service was great, and we both had a wonderful time. It had a very friendly and welcoming ambiance. We both decided that we were going to come back mid-way through our meal (right after the shrimp to be precise) -- my bf said we were going back again next week, but I'm not sure if he was kidding.

5.0,12/8/2011,"OK, I've eaten at this restaurant twice before (at this location) and I got different things both times. The first time I had the cowboy steak. pretty damn good (and a lot of meat, doggy-bagged it). It was medium (cooked) and very juicy. They are kid friendly (we have a toddler) and I got broccoli and potato au-gratin for him. Being a friggin picky toddler, he disregarded the broccoli (which they just plainly steamed, which I happen to like anyway) but he liked the potatoes. I thought the potatoes were slightly watery but you could tell it was made from scratch. I got a $75 bottle of wine with the meal, drank a glass, and was halfway hammered by the time the food arrived, which made it taste even more delightful.The second time we went, we ditched the kid and went on an afternoon date after going to museum. Again, I ordered wine (a glass this time), and again halfway hammered, my lamb chops arrived. AWESOME. If I ever go back (which I'm sure I will) I will get lamb chops. they were meaty (of course not as much as a steak) but I was still full. Again, I ordered them cooked medium and it was just crazy good. We (as in my and my BF) shared a sweet-potato casserole, and let me tell you, they are better than YO MAMA's (and mine) sweet potatoes. IDK what the hell they put in it, but it was just perfect. I would even suggest ordering that for desert with ice cream... its a perfect match. In addition, both times we went the place wasn't super packed but I suggest making reservations just in case.",0,0,1,Amanda L.,"Brooklyn, NY",23,10,0

How exciting coming to the steak house I always wanted to come to and to spend a special occasion of my loved one.Got excited too soon.Ordering went fine and the night was as I expected. I went to the front desk after using the bathroom to make sure one last time there was a note on the reservation ""Wife's birthday"" and they acknowledged by saying ""Yes sir, we do have the note and the waiter has been notified."" Went back to my seat and asked for the dessert menu and ordered.Out came the dessert and no writing of happy birthday sign or singing. Thinking maybe they will serve something special after we have our regular dessert. After 10minutes nothing, so I ask for the check. Maybe they are gonna do something or bring some other dessert with the check to surprise her..........nope......nothing. Just the bill itself. I asked the waiter for a pen and wrote him a message.He came back rushing apologizing in front of my wife he forgot about the notes and the occasion. I was stunned. I thought in a place like this they would've apologized in a different style. And the lack of communication and focus just shocked me.

4.0,9/18/2011,"Long overdue, my friends and I visited the Ruth's Chris Steak House, which is right under my building, for the first time. Here' s a brief description:Unlike Wolfgang's, this place is unique, sincere and classy. The waiters (and waitress) are nice, responsive, smiling and, well, classy. The overall atmosphere is sincere, dimly lit and well thought of. The colors, the cushions on the backs of the lounge seats, the lounge area, all tasty (and a bit heavy but that's a part of the taste I believe). You don't feel like ""oh this place is a cheap knock-off"" at all.The food: I care only about dry aged prime steak and that's what I got. A nice ~12 ounce of sizzling T-bone. The meat: I want to say that without the butter on top and over salted crust the steak would have been quite stale and dry. Even at medium-rare state I could feel that it was dry at its core. That much butter and salt can turn cardboard into a tasty dish. But I want to be careful and not dish them out all together. It definitely was not to the level of sophistication as Peter Luger's but it was much better than Wolfgang's that's for sure. Presentation was much better than Wolfgang's as well.The drink: At ~$50 a bottle, we had two bottles of Chardonnay (can't remember which one, my friend picked it) and it was good enough. Not ""wow"" (even for that price) but definitely not bad at all - above the average at that lower range price level.The bill: Ended up paying $110 a person for a meal of 2 pre-fixes at $50 a piece (good deal, you get a soup/salad, entree, and a dessert for $50) + $100 for the wine + $50 for my meat + 10 for one extra side (mashed potato) + $16 for a martini + $6 for a glass of house merlot that I tried + tax + tip. I would not call this place ""cheap"" but at least they accept credit cards :))My current standingsI would definitely go to Ruth's Chris againI would not go back to Wolfgang if a good friend would not ask of me toI would never give up Peter Luger's",1,0,1,I.C.

(many of you would know what I mean)It did not take too long for us to realize how wrong we were.(Ambiance)Not crowded at all.  Not loud at all.  Very nice music selection (not to classy but not too casual).  Pleasant lighting.  Seating was comfortable.  Bathroom was well decorated.  Perfect temperature.(Service)Wait staffs were all very friendly and nice.  Good wine recommendation.  I am not good with faces that I never recognize my server.  However, they were very alert that they came to me the moment I turned my head around to look for them.

I am not a big fan of Gazpacho, but it was still pretty good. House salad was mediocre (but How much can they do with house salad?!?! you know?)Medium-rare 8oz filet was exceptional.  It was served on a very hot hot plate (apparently 500 decree Celsius), which kept the meat tender and warm until I finished .  Nicely seasoned, juice was kept inside didn't spill any (like many other medium-rare steaks), BEAUTIFULLY layered!!!  Lobster was very very good too.

Once everyone came out of the woodworked and decided to come, we had to call back twice to change it. The last time I called, which was 3 days before our arrival, the hostess told me that if our party grew over 18 people they would have to give us the private party room. We agreed, until she continued to inform us that you HAD to sign a contract stating that you WILL spend over $1500 at least. How could I promise such a thing? I know theres 18 people, but what if some do the special? What if some don't drink? What if some suddenly get sick and need to go home? I didn't want to sign my life into some sort of contract. What is this AT&T? We refused, and she reassured us that we will just have a large table in the main dining room.Upon arrival, they did in fact put us in the private room. We freaked out a bit, and told them we weren't signing a contract since we never agreed to it. Whatever, they were ok with it, and besides now we can be loud without oldies starring at us. What also disappointed us was that instead of 1 big table for our entire party to converse, they gave us 2 smaller tables split up by 9. Now - majority of our party is Italian, and we like to feast together as a group. Besides, the hostess had already promised 1 large table.We called over the manager and she was actually pretty rude about it. Even rolled her eyes when we asked to put the tables together. She also mentioned that if we would have been in the main dining room, we would have been seated at 5 or 6 little tables. What? Who do they have working the phones at this place? On top of it, they told us we had to leave for 15 minutes for them to put the tables together. 15 minutes? Really? We can all lift a corner and do this as a group people. Why should we now have to get up for another 15 minutes, drinks in hand, after already waiting to be seated just because you screwed up?Anywho - after we rearranged the place, we sat down for our meal. This was not the first time we've been to a Ruth Chris so it was easy deciding. The stuffed chicken dish is phenom. The mash potatoes are none like you have ever tried.

You're telling me.Enough about surf and turf. If you're going for the manliest offering, you should probably stick with caesar salad / ribeye. Medium rare, of course. The only way to enjoy a good steak.One last comment. They're not afraid of butter. Seriously though. If you don't like a LOT of butter, then tell them.",3,2,1,Alex S.,"Jersey City, NJ",173,393,48
4.0,5/17/2011,"A steakhouse with class that is not pretentious and rude?  I'm in. The service is suburb.  Everyone was friendly, attentive, polite and I was impressed.  I am a fan of the decor; the wood makes for a very warm atmosphere.  We came here on a Monday night after work at 6pm.  It was empty when we got there and a full house by the time we left.  The waiters and the menus disclose both of the following facts:-steaks are cooked with salt, pepper and butter - you can choose more, less, or none-what to expect when you specify how you want your steak cookedPretty fool proof if you ask me - my steak was perfectWe went through the menu several times until we both decided on what we wanted, and then as we go to place our order we land upon the Ruth's Classics prix fixe? whattttt? We both still got the choices we wanted (he a rib eye and me a petite filet with shrimp - I upgraded to half of a lobster ;) ) and we got soup/salad, side, and dessert.  This is a much better option if you want more variety and less of a side.  I was very much ok with spending less, getting less mashed potatoes and adding a delicious peanut butter panna cotta with cocoa peanut truffles that were mind blowing. My lobster was sooo garlicy and I loved it.  I didn't need to add lemon at all.  My petite filet was like butter - again it was perfect.  Granted - butter makes it unhealthy, but we do not cook our steaks with butter at home and if you don't eat steak every time you go out then you can enjoy a delicious buttery steak once in a blue moon.  And yes, I enjoyed it. The creamed spinach was good and the garlic mashed potatoes were average.  The watermelon and greens summer salad was refreshing, light, and flavorful.  I definitely recommend it!The dessert was so good, rich, and heavy that we both couldn't finish either of ours!  I made sure to finish my truffles though - of course :)They have a very extensive wine list.  My boyfriend chose an awesomely smooth Cabernet Sauvignon which we enjoyed very much.  PS - They aren't joking about the plates being hot - seriously do not touch them.",2,0,2,Marissa S.,"New York, NY",164,422,88

The food was good and they met all requests for putting a healthier spin on our selections. I know its a steakhouse, but that doesn't mean you can't cook with less oil, butter and put sauces to the side. (They would benefit from this actually considering all the calories are printed on the menu in NYC!)I would like to see them do some healthier fish and steak salads and dishes. The dining room was near empty and I think its because they are so ""corporate"".

4.0,4/20/2011,"I went here recently, and boy was it a surprise. Let me say that the decor is a little old school Italian mob like, but I absolutely loved it. I felt like I was in a scene from the Godfather, it was great. The atmosphere is very calm, people whisper and use their ""inside voices"" even when ordering. Now onto the food ! I ordered the Chicken which was filled with some type of cheese, my boyfriend got the Steak and Shrimp. (His Steak was medium.) Now let me tell you the reason why I LOVE this place. For all the non foodies in your life, this is the place to go ! For all those people who know NOTHING about steak this is the place to go. Everything is explained right from the start so there's no confusion and you meal comes out simply perfect. We began our meal with a salad, my Cesar salad was great, and my boyfriend's house salad was fresh. And might I add that it was the perfect portion. After this our waitress came by and she was very very nice, she quickly but meticulously gave us the run down on steaks: 1) All steaks at Ruth's Chris are seasoned with only salt, pepper, and a touch of butter 2) DO NOT touch your plate when it comes because it is VERY hot. 3) Enjoy. Now, this information being given to us I thought in the silence of my tummy, ""Now I'm excited."" We placed out orders and got Mashed potatoes, string beans, and creamed spinach as our sides. The entrees came out so piping hot. ONE WORD: PERFECTION. NEVER has a piece of meat melted on my tongue. NEVER has a piece of Chicken cut so tenderly a knife was of no use. (The Steak also came with a side of shrimp, which was okay.) The Bottom Line: Ruth's is great for dinner, but know that you need to make reservations before you go. I did not have to wait because I know a few people here and there, but just a heads up. Also it would be in your interest to skip the dessert, the cheesecake was okay. They have a apple type dessert that is really good though. Be advised that on some nights the crowd can be a little...rowdy. I usually go on a week day because that the best time to test a restaurant's food.

2.0,4/1/2011,"I've actually wanted to go to Ruth's Chris since I saw one of their ads depicting a massive beef filet the size of a small child. I know it's a chain and all, but I've had some great steaks at chains, including Del Frisco's and Capital Grille. Looking back though, I wish I would have used a bit more discretion to pick a place.I have to say, the first thing that I noticed about Ruth's Chris was how unsophisticated the service was. Our waiter was out of his element and a bit unpolished for this kind of place. It made the entire experience feel much more 'street' than we normally experience at a steakhouse.Anyway, we got to ordering, and I went with their classic deal which featured a salad, steak, side and dessert for $50. I opted for the steakhouse salad, the filet, the green beans with garlic, and the cherry cake with vanilla ice cream. My girl got the petit filet and the onion rings. We also got a few drinks while we waited for the food.My salad showed up pretty quickly, but it was a total throwaway; 3 cherry tomatoes, some greens, and a few croutons. Everything was limp and chilled to death. Not very interesting. Our steaks followed shortly thereafter. I love the gimmick that its cooked at 1800 degrees and then served on a 500 degree plate. But this process needs to be a bit better regulated as my medium rare steak was more like medium, maybe even a bit more. I should note, the quality of the meat was quite good. My girl liked her steak, and she rocked that entire order of onion rings, 850 cals and all, bless her soul. As for the dessert, it was total crap, dry angel food cake with generic icing and ice cream. My girl took a single unsatisfying bite and cast a gypsy spell on the baker.In the end, we dropped  $160 for 2 steaks, 2  sides, 3 drinks, 1 dessert, and tip. Quality was a mixed bag. Not worth the time, money and effort in my opinion. We would have been much better off at Wolfgang's or Keen's.",4,1,0,Jeff S.,"Bucks County, PA",592,1834,584

It came sizzling on a hot plate fresh out of the broiler. It was tender and juicy and perfectly cooked just as I ordered it. We shared the staple sides: mashed potatoes and creamed spinach. Both were delicious. The dessert was a simple cheesecake, which was accompanied by chocolate bark. The cheesecake was simple yet very creamy- the fork just slipped through the cake.

The decor was simple and elegant. Once you step into the restaurant, the buttery aroma fills the air. Our servers were really nice and friendly.Most of the people in my party ordered steak, since this place was a steakhouse. For the table we've ordered onion rings, shoe string fries, ravioli and calamari. The onion rings were huge, but yet they were sad. The batter on the onion rings were not that crispy and they were really oily. The calamari was okay. The ravioli and shoe string fries tasted pretty good.I ordered the filet steak topped with blue cheese. When my steak came along with everyone else's steak, the buttery aroma has gotten really strong. The steak was very tender and juicy, but the blue cheese overpowered the taste of the steak that I had to eat the steak without the blue cheese. For dessert I've ordered the creme brulee, which was delicious.

They could seat a crazy amount of people and that they did. I didn't really like how full it was, but what can I do. It was so busy that it definitely affected the service.They were prompt to give us ice water and bread.. but the bread was uncut which somewhat appalled me. Our waiter took a while to take our orders, but he was pleasant enough. The atmosphere is private, being that it's dimly lit inside. Our food took forever to come out though, to the point where we were both getting antsy.I got the Seafood Gumbo and Phil got the House Salad. The gumbo was okay, The salad was okay, the dressing was quite sour. Then the 12 oz NY Strip for Phil (medium rare) and the 8 oz petite filet for me (medium rare). Phils came out perfect but mine was overcooked. I was going to ask them to take it back but I figured it would take too long / I was only a restaurant week customer.

5.0,12/13/2010,"I went for lunch during Restaurant Week.Certain steakhouses weren't offering filets on the lunch menu, but luckily, Ruth's Chris was offering a petit filet on the lunch menu.  We headed over with a big group for a late lunch and since it was the middle of the day, started off with some diet cokes.  While we waited for our party to arrive, we snacked on some bread.  The first loaves of bread that we got were very warm, and were toasted nicely.  Unfortunately since it was almost the end of lunch service, the bread wasn't coming out as frequently as I would have liked (I love carbs), and when I requested another loaf with my soup, it was a little hard, since it must have been toasted earlier.  But honestly, the bread was my only complaint of the meal.For an appetizer, you could choose between a corn and crab meat chowder, or a house salad.  I went with the soup and thought it was delicious, with great chunks of crab meat.  I sampled the salad as well and thought the soup was the better of the two choices, but those eating salad at the table thought it was very good and mentioned they really enjoyed the dressing.What I loved about Ruth's Chris was unlike other steakhouse experiences, Ruth's Chris actually includes your choice of a side with your entree.  And these weren't small portions, but rather full size-side dishes, so if you were on a date, I'd recommend ordering one of each because there will be plenty to share. I ordered the creamed spinach and thought it was excellent.  Sometimes restaurants can make their creamed spinach a little cheesey, but this wasn't very heavy on the cheese (read: so I didn't enter into a food coma).  Also, the waiter was kind enough to bring out a side of steamed broccoli on the house.The filet at Ruth's Chris was 6 ounces, but between the appetizer and dessert, it was enough.  I ordered mine rare, and everyone was worried it'd be too red for my liking. The steak though is brought out to you on such a hot plate that the moment you cut into it and put the center of the meat on the plate, it continues cooking.  Ruth's Chris also cooks their steak in butter, so it tastes amazing.  Unfortunately, Ruth's Chris also is required to put the caloric intake of each item, so my advice is to not even open the regular menu, but rather stare directly at the Restaurant Week menu so you don't feel guilty.Dessert was ""Ruth's Chris Special Dessert.""  As someone who studies menus before going into a meal like someone studying for the Bar exam, I was a bit worried.  However, dessert was great.  On our plates we were given two items - one being berries in a sweet cream sauce, and the other was chocolate mousse in a chocolate shell.  The mousse was the perfect portion - not too much that it felt too heavy, and the blueberries and whipped cream were a wonderful compliment.  My personal favorite though was the berries in the sweet cream sauce.  The sweet cream sauce to me tasted exactly like a thinner version of cake batter.  The strawberries, the blueberries and the raspberries were to die for in this sauce.  I pretty much licked the plate clean.If you want to do Restaurant Week, make reservations at Ruth Chris.  You won't be disappointed.",0,1,0,Laura F.,"Cortlandt, NY",70,186,18

It was probably one of the best filets, I've ever had.  It was juicy, tender, and pretty much perfect.  The second time I went was a year later, and by this time I was starting to lean a little more towards vegetarianism, so opted for the stuffed chicken instead.  (I know, definitely still meat, but I wasn't yet ready to be one of those people that orders salad in a steak house.)  The chicken was stuffed with garlic herb cheese and served with butter. MY GOD!  This may have even been better than the steak, although I'm not sure if it's possible for chicken to be better than steak.This is not a place I would go to again just because of my change in eating habits, but that does not mean it's not still a great restaurant that meat eaters should definitely enjoy.",1,0,0,Alexandra T.,"Decatur, GA",50,118,0

But messing up pretty much every person's food, from appetizer to entree to sides to dessert? That's special, alright. Especially at $45 for an entree.Only my sister's steak wasn't overcooked, mainly because she loves very dry, tough, charcoal-like meat. Rib eyes? Overcooked, including my other sister's much anticipated ""rare"". Filets? Overcooked, not so tender. Shrimp? Rubbery. Sweet potato casserole? Sweeter than dessert should be. Chowder? Better add water to combat the salt. Even my Mom, who loves salt, said it was way too salty. At least they only charged my vegan dad $21 for his entree of just steamed vegetables.

There were a couple of groups also dining when we went, so I wish for our date it had been a little quieter.We skipped appetizers and just had entrees. He requested the lobster, I being more of a meat & potatoes kinda girl had the petite fillet and shrimp. I have a much milder pallet than most people and the shrimp had a bit of spice to them, nothing overwhelming though. The 2 small round steaks that are the petite fillet were juicy and well cooked. I always order well done, and thick pieces if steak always concern me, but they were cooked all the way through. I liked the nice sizzling butter thing they do on the plates.The lobster my bf ordered was really delish, tender, buttery, well seasoned.

4.0,2/24/2010,"3 for food4 for overall experienceI went there last night for my friend's birthday. It was good, and I enjoyed my food, but it wasn't anything to write home about. I think there may be a difference in the food when you get the ""meal deal"" thing (appetizer, entree, veggie, dessert combo deal). My friend's dad's fillet looked MUCH nicer than her combo fillet.  It is cheaper to do that than to get an entree on it's own. The portions are small, which is fine if you are getting heavy items like gumbo, steak, potatoes and chocolate cake, but if you are more of the house salad, light entree, green beans and berries kind of person then you aren't going to leave stuffed. So for me it was great because I got a moderately healthy meal and didn't leave with a tummy ache... for others that want to feel full... they probably wanted to hit the corner store after.It's the first time that I actually appreciated having the calorie count on the menu because it made me feel good! 160 calories for the salad, less than 500 for the entrees, 150 for my green beans (steamed), and the berries were just berries. Not bad!Our waiter (Jimmy) was fantastic and ever brought out dessert with a candle on it for my friend's birthday, even though it was just mentioned to him in passing. He was cheery and attentive, so I couldn't ask for more.If you are going to get the dinner combo then it's a pretty good deal. If you are going to get things separately then be prepared to pay a nice penny. Overall it was a good experience, but it's not my favorite steakhouse.",1,1,1,S H.,"New York, NY",12,299,1

2.0,2/10/2010,"I initially walked into Ruth's Chris feeling like a food curmudgeon but came away somewhat surprised by the end of the night. While it was no Peter Luger's, the whole experience was not a complete wash.I had a gift card to blow here and thought I'd put to good use by inviting a couple of friends along for the ride. We were all intrigued by the promise of sizzling butter and meat. The decor with the heavy wood paneling, dark green tones screams hotel restaurant and the flux of tourists and businessmen in the room confirmed that. Our server was an earnest, friendly fellow though we were left lingering for some time after his introduction. Still, our water and wine glasses were always topped up and we were regularly checked upon throughout the meal. And he didn't flinch a bit in our requests for extra sour cream and bread. Classy broads we are. We started off with the sliced tomato and blue cheese salad. Simple, light-exactly as it sounds. One of our crew ordered the prix fixe special and enjoyed the salmon as her main. It was moist and lightly seasoned to our surprise. My friend and I had the porterhouse to two which was presented with a dramatic flourish, sizzling butter plate and all. Our sides of steamed asparagus and baked potato were big enough to share and were fine, although the accompanying 'hollandaise' sauce seemed to be out of a tub rather than homemade. Oh well, it's a chain whatdya expect. The porterhouse was fine, cooked to order at a bright medium rare but it was small, almost half the size of my regular order at Peter Luger. And this is where I have to be a stickler because at $85 it was priced in the neighborhood of some of the finer steakhouses in town. Keen's, Old Homestead and of course Peter Luger's. As for the taste, it was tender and juicy and benefited from the lashings of melted butter. Howevah! It still tasted like wet muck compared to the dry aged beauties at Peter Luger. Missing was the rich mineral tang of aged cow, the buttery marbling of fat and the perfectly broiled crust on top. I salvaged my meat partially by heaping some A1 on top. So overall the quality of the steak here does not justify the high price point especially when this city is not lacking in great steakhouses. You know what this city needs? A Keg that's what. The Cdn chain cooks up nice steaks at a lower price point while keeping up with the classy surroundings and trends.This isn't a bad spot for dinner although I would suggest going with the specials to get the best bang for the buck. Otherwise you're better off going to Peter Luger's for porterhouse or some of the other knockoffs around town.",15,6,11,Deanna W.,"New York, NY",343,320,232

The staff understands that you don't have to spend your time or money with them. During restaurant week, you get the best bang for your buck! You will get a full meal, appetizer, side dish, salmon, steak or shrimp and a desert for around $35. But they do run specials other times as well. You just have to check out the site. (hint, hint) The other yelpers were correct about the ""Petit Filet"" but its well worth the price during the other times. The meat is always cooked to perfection, if it is just a little off you can send it back. the service makes the meal more enjoyable each and every time.

The filet was very good, cooked rare with a cool purple center...mmmmm red meat =), although not the best I've ever had. It was very tender but I was a little disappointed with the tiny threads of fat that ran through it's center. The cheesecake on the other hand was to die for. So rich and creamy with a delicious, crumbly crust and a layer of cream that layered the top. Unfortunately we were stuffed from dinner, so only got a few bites in.The service was excellent.

We waited 45 minutes past our reservation time (7:30pm) because they were ""backed up"". I had to ask the waiter for tap water three times. When asking for a recommendation of wine, our waiter rudely gave us one option ""Get the wine on the restaurant week list. It's cheaper"". Our salad was bland, limp, and as a ""steak salad"" they should note that there is NO steak on there. It's just greens, croutons, and italian dressing. We both ordered the ribeye. My dining partner cut out a small plates-worth of gooey fat (I've had ribeye before and it's not even close to this bad). The mashed potatoes were dry and looked as if they had been sitting out in their respective plates for a while. The dessert (chocolate mousse) reminded me of the cakes you find at Chinese buffets.I wish I bothered to look at the waiter's name, but I was too eager to get out of there. The waiter was pushy, rude, and even took the check before we left. I'm still trying to get over the shock that I had paid for that meal.I've been to hole-in-the-wall cafes that have both better service and steak/sides than this excuse for a steakhouse.

Yes, they do the steak is still sizzling thing when they bring it out... and the decor is pretty nice and new, which means that this place is a lot more date friendly than superior steakhouses like PL's.

Although, they use a little too much drawn butter. I don't prefer this. A good piece of meat only really needs salt and pepper. But you can ask for less, or no butter at all.

We had reservations for 4pm and got there early and were immediately seated, which was very nice. This was my second time eating here, but the first time we were seated upstairs and I didn't have the most memorable experience.Our waitress was very sweet, though not the brightest bulb on the Christmas tree, if you will (forgive me - I'm in the Christmas spirit). We were very clear with our ordering and weren't the typical loud obnoxious large group. In addition to our appetizers and entrees we ordered 2 sides of asparagus, 2 sides of mashed potatoes, and one side of mushrooms for the table. When it arrived, it was just 2 sides of mashed potatoes and 2 sides of broccoli. Then when we told the waitress of the mix-up, she blamed us! Well Mrs. Ruth's Waitress, we are a family of 11 who heard the order being placed, and we were RIGHT! So she came back with the correct order (except she also brought an additional mushroom side). We'll forgive her, because yeah, it must be hard to deal with large groups, but I must say that we were very clear with our ordering! This is an ""upscale"" place after all, so it's not like little cousin James was yelling across the table, flicking food at his sister, or rousing the table with a game of ""I Spy"" while people were trying to place their order!Anywhoo, onto the food. It was VERY good! As a vegetarian I was a little afraid about their veggie-friendly options, but I was pleasantly surprised to see portobello mushrooms on the menu, and they came with mashed potatoes, asparagus, broccoli, and tomatoes. It was very yummy and filling! All of my family ordered steaks and they said they were delicious. We also got the crab cakes and calamari for appetizers, and the calamari here is absolutely amazing! It has this tangy sauce on it with red pepper and it was the best calamari I've ever had.The restaurant itself is very nice inside, and it's the type of place where if you're not dressed up, you're going to feel a little silly.

4.0,9/9/2006,"Whether you're an Internet billionaire or merely a drug smuggler, anyone with six million dollars and an appetite for steak can have a great meal at Ruth's Chris.  Expect to put on between fifty and sixty pounds when eating their absolutely fantastic steaks, soaked in butter.  The atmosphere is weird for a manhattan joint, but it's a chain, so I suppose this is forgivable.  The waiters were inattentive during the meal, but the on-site EMS workers did manage to recussitate my date after her massive steak-induced coronary.",4,6,4,Brock T.,"New York, NY",20,20,0
3.0,5/27/2006,"I ordered the filet mignon and didn't think it was anything special.  I have eaten at the other 'fine' steakhouses and don't really think Ruths Chris is anything extraordinary.  Maybe I need different cut of meat.  Service was okay, appetizers were okay...  mediocre in my opinion",0,0,0,Eddie T.,"Wanaque, NJ",132,102,645
5.0,5/22/2006,"Steakhouses are the strip clubs of the restaurant world.  The second you walk in everyone is rubbing against you for tips.  Everything costs at least $20 and at first you think, should I really be doing this but then once you get what you came for you just want more.  My experience at Ruths Chris was phenomenal as I walked in the door with my friend 10 people jumped to attention to show us to our seat but all I could think about was steak.  I was surprised with the respect we were treated with as this was a really nice looking place and we were in T-shirt and jeans.  Our waitress was really cute and extremely attentive.  My t-bone was melt in your mouth delicious.  The blend of seasonings along with the buttery finish truly brought me to a meaty heaven.  I was trying to keep the expenses to a minimum but my friend and I needed a 2nd serving of mashed potatoes.  In the end, despite the cost we left the waitress a well deserved tip and I had the feeling that I'd be back for that delicious steak again.",1,3,1,Evan K.,"Los Angeles, CA",26,114,0
5.0,2/10/2006,"The creme de la creme of my dining experience.  For a truly fabulous meal and completely elegant decor, this is IT!  When I lucky, I'm being taken, but sometimes I treat.  The service is elegant (which to my mind means quick, friendly and not too talkative).  The food's a little pricy, but more than worth it.  My fave is the stuffed chicken breast, potatoes lyonnaise and corn pudding with the berries and cream dessert.  And did I mention that they refill diet cokes?  No whining, neither.",3,1,2,Richard G.,"New York, NY",11,7,0
5.0,1/30/2006,"Sure you have Peter Luger's but if you want something just as tasty without the old world vibe try Ruth's Chris. It is a great steakhouse where the meat comes to you on a sizzling plate, cooking in butter. The lobster steak combo is enough to put you into a serious food coma, if you're still awake at the end of the meal the fresh raspberry and creme desert is killer. It's a little pricey so bring the Amex and a smile.",0,0,0,nelson w.,"New York, NY",13,15,0
