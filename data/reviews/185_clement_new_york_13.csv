4.0,2/21/2019,"Can't decide if this place feelsLike old New York or just old. Went here for restaurant week and really enjoyed myself because they have a cool bar where I waited for my lunch date. Service was impeccable and actually felt friendly too! The whole place feels a little slower than the rest of the city and made for a very relaxed lunch. Or it could have just been the wine that made me unwind. Can't say the restaurant week menu was too exciting the usual Salmon, Chicken and Vegetarian dish options. They really could have been a bit more adventurous. I did really love my ceviche appetizer and the salmon was perfectly cooked and came with a a side of mushrooms instead of the usual starch so that was a nice change. Overall a very good experience and would definitely come back again for restaurant week.",2,0,2,Monica S.,"Brooklyn, NY",85,138,452
3.0,2/15/2019,"Valentines day 2019 - Everything about Clement was promising. The ambiance, the service, the staff, the environment, was wonderful. The prefix menu looked lovely. The courses finally arrived, and I felt like the kitchen staff was playing a joke on it's guests. Starting with a miniscule, salty little oyster covered in some offensive rose water concoction.The dissapointment continued with the second course, an utterly bland""tempura"" fritter. This was totally non-descript, for all I knew I could have been some kind of space ration. Suddenly, a ray of light appears in the form of this gorgeous Mediterranean Langoustine. The sommelier claimed that this crustacean was Spanish in origin. I took his word for it and very eagerly dug in. It was delicious, albeit a bit too salty, but delicious nonetheless.My interest had peaked, and I was very excited for the upcoming Wagyu coup de gras. All of my expectations came crashing down when I was served a beautiful piece of Wagyu, that was devoid of salt, and covered with some pomegranate reduction. The chef committed murder. He took a gorgeous ingredient, which is a star in its own right, and drowned it in sweet sauce. It was accompanied by same sad, dry roasted potatoes and beets. Next up was, 3, 三, tres, trois, , drei, THREE DESSERTS! I'll make this quick. The first one was good. A homemade blend of ice creams. Very delicious. The second was an absolutely mind blowing dessert that can't even be put in words. It was easily the best dish of the night, and possibly one of the most delicious pastries I've ever eaten.The last course was a totally unnecessary, small plate of mediocre pastries. I'm sure that the pastry chef put in lots of work into producing that last plate, but after being bombarded with sweets for the past 3 courses, I was done.Thanks for reading.",0,0,0,Nicholas T.,"Woodside, NY",0,4,0
5.0,2/2/2019,"If you haven't been to the Clement during Restaurant Week you're missing a great experience.  Friday night after work a friend & I went and it wasn't very crowded.  For appetizers she had the Hawaiian Yellowtail Ceviche and I had the Heirloom Squash Soup.  Both were great!  For our entrees we both had the Za'atar Roasted Rack of Lamb, which were so yummy and the portions were generous.  For dessert we tried both the Mont Blanc and the Ivory Chocolate Tart.   We had the vodka special and the featured wine.  I did have an American decaf coffee, which was $9, so you might want to skip coffee and stick with the drinks.  Service was exceptional so tip generously.",0,0,0,Mia S.,"Jersey City, NJ",66,11,0

We came for Winter Restaurant Week and let's be honest, most fancy restaurants don't give you their best service during RW but Clement did not disappoint. The servers were so attentive and knowledgeable especially Marco. He gave us great recommendations and went above and beyond with every course. The food was also very good. Every course was awesome! I had the squash soup with crab for appetizer, Cuttlefish ink pasta for my main entreé- so tasty!! And then the Mont Blanc for dessert which is a light, yummy chestnut dessert. For drinks, I ordered Take Me Anywhere, so tasty and pretty with the Jasmine flower. My flower didn't bloom in my drink so Marco took it back and gave me another one with the blooming Jasmine.

3.0,1/24/2019,"I ate here with a friend for Winter 2019 restaurant week and the food was so so so amazing (definitely exceeded expectations for restaurant week) but the service was terrible and that really ruined it for us.The restaurant was pretty empty on a Wednesday night, probably three or four other tables in our section. Waiters were super pretentious and pretty rude when they found out we were doing the restaurant week menu and not ordering additional drinks (we had just come from drinks). The waiters joked, laughed, and brought out plenty of free appetizers, drinks and desserts to the older ladies seated next to us but all but scoffed at me when I asked if I could choose my dessert after I finished my meal, and snapped when I told them I'd like to take my entree to go because I couldn't finish it. Can't help but wonder the problem was that me and my friend were both POCs and younger than the average diner there.They turned the lights on promptly 2 hours after we began our meal, the other two tables in our section were still finishing their food and drinks when they began rushing us out. One of the tables had sat down after us, so I guess they were only there about 1.5 hours? That's really not a long dinner so I don't understand how the waiters expected us to finish in that time.To be fair though, the portions were generous and the quality was still amazing, even though it was restaurant week. So props to the chefs, but a big thumbs down to the servers.",2,0,0,Johanna L.,"New York, NY",1,23,2

5.0,1/3/2019,"We had dinner here tonight with my nephews and what and awesome experience. Started with bringing a small table over for my girlfriends handbag so it doesn't sit on the floor. Marco was our waiter and wow was he the most customer centric person I've had in my 30 years of eating fine food all over the world. Ya I just said that. We ordered the caviar and he brought over a complimentary sparkling rose that paired perfectly. The appetizers were delightful with the lobster bisque, oysters and octopus which were all so good we will judge every dish after this against these as the the best in show. Again Marco brought me a complimentary Sancerre that was awesome with the oysters. Then Marco gave us a great cabernet recommendation thats really economical (which I would not expect here) and paired great. The entrees arrived  and we were further dazzled by the Dover Sole and cuddle fish dishes plus the dry aged steak which was a perfect medium rare and melted in your mouth. All in all a delightful experience and fantastic flavors with shining service.",0,0,0,Matt B.,"Danbury, CT",20,60,52

I also had requested that we get a table by the big window so we could have a nice view, also followed through! Our hostess was very kind and took our coats to coat check. Our server, Luis, was a dream. So nice and so thoughtful. Seriously, some of the best service I've had in NYC to date. The whole hotel staff (in and outside of Clement) were lovely!

4.0,10/14/2018,"We had a very good dinner here and were VERY well taken care of by the staff.I thought I read this restaurant has been at this location inside the Peninsula Hotel for 5 years +.  I suspect its location inside a hotel is an additional challenge versus all the stand-alone spots in midtown, my opinion only.    I searched some Yelp reviews in the neighborhood and nothing really motivated me enough to leave the Peninsula for dinner so we gave Clement a try.  One silly thing, I opened up my OpenTable app and figured I'd explore a reservation since it was a Friday night,  Voila ONE TABLE left at 9 pm.  I guess that meant only one table on OpenTable as there were a dozen tables at least available as we arrived .  I'll reserve my commentary about that marketing.  The food was excellent and the staff was even better than that.  We enjoyed some scallops and lamb chops, both were very tasty. And it was a healthy size rack of lamb too.   Alongside were some well prepared brussel sprouts garnished with  pomegranate seeds.  We ordered a split of Pride merlot, and it was so darn good requested a second.  This is where the staff delivered, as they didn't have the second split available immediately and offered a better choice at the same price.  They did so only because we were mid meal and didn't want us to be without wine while they tracked down a second bottle.  This was a staff that recognized how a dinner experience should progress.  So the staff gets a 5+ on this night from me.  Thank you Marco and Luis? Nice bar off the restaurant too.",0,0,1,Mark S.,"Saint Louis, MO",87,142,56
5.0,9/8/2018,"This was by far one of the best birthday dinners I have had in a while.  Located inside of the Peninsula Hotel this is a 5-star experience all the way around.The food. Absolutely everything was presented impeccably, nothing was out of place. All the food was perfectly seasoned, not overly salted but also not bland.My only 4-star experience was with the oysters. If you regularly read my rants... I mean reviews... you would know that I basically live for oysters and oyster happy hours. These oysters were super fresh and were a great size. My issue is that they put olive oil in them. That may be some sophisticated dressing I know nothing about but...NAH I'll pass. It was not my favorite taste at all.Service. 5-Star as well, with the prices on the menu I expected amazing service and we were not disappointed. My mom and the waiter made fast friends and he convinced her of several wines and I do thoroughly enjoy watching my mother get drunk hahaha!We were worried that we were going to be asked to leave at some point because we arrived an hour before it was scheduled to close. However, we spent a good 3 hours there and were never asked to leave or even rushed.Wonderful experience",2,3,2,Wanda W.,"Brooklyn, NY",313,284,834

5.0,7/27/2018,"Note: Restaurant Week Summer 2018 review.Wow. I don't quite recall how I initially came across Clement, but doing some typical (obsessive) Restaurant Week research, it looked like Clement had a very decent offering and is relatively close-by to where I work, so...why not have some fancy dinner - we all gotta eat, right?As other reviewers helpfully pointed at, the restaurant itself is located in the Peninsula Hotel and is just a quick flight upstairs as you enter.  I was happily greeted and promptly seated.  While the restaurant wasn't super busy at the time (8pm on Thursday), I must say the staff is impeccably attentive. I was quickly 'watered' and asked if I wanted a cocktail (opted for the 'seasonal' - Ultimate Vodka, St-Germain, Lemon - refreshing and delicious).  Shortly thereafter, with my drink came some hearty whole wheat bread (several more rolls than I could ever finish) and softened butter. And then the courses began.Complementary Starter: a lovely, velvety [sweet potato...maybe?] mousse-filled tart with chili flakes.Appetizer: Crispy Octopus with Basil-Pea Puree, Pickled Stone Fruit, Puffed Grain - it wasn't huge, but it was very tasty. Puffed grain added some nice crunch to go along with the stone fruit. Solid dish.Complementary Pasta: An amazing rigatoni dish with peas, green beans, watercress, and plenty of cheese garnishment. Absolutely delightful. Plate cleaned. Main Course: Za'atar Roasted Rack of Lamb with Japanese Eggplant, Juniper Yogurt - Wow. You had be at za'atar...and at lamb. Just a phenomenal dish. The lamb was cooked to a perfect medium rare and incredibly seasoned, and I could help but slather it in the delightful juniper yogurt. The eggplant was tender and scrumptious as well.Complementary White Wine: ...wow. why? but wow. thank you.Complementary Red Wine: ...god I love you guys.Dessert: Peach Melba with Chocolate Dirt, Olive Oil Sorbet, Almond Sour Cream. Light, fruity, delightful.Oh, and here's some birthday cake while we're at it. I can honestly say dinner at Clement was one of the best dining experiences I've had in a long, long time.

5.0,6/2/2018,Elegant restaurant located in the balcony level of the Peninsula Hotel.

The peanuts/cheese/olives they give you are great. However - the service was not great. They had us move because the table we were at was ""reserved for three people"" and shortly after only 2 people were sat at the table who had no reservation.

Our host and main server was a rude old guy who was not even trying to hide his mysoginy/agism or whatever that was. He mostly talked to my bf (who is 13 years older than me). When he brought a bottle of wine (it was a pre-selected wine from restaurant week menu, so it's not like my bf chose it) he let my bf taste it, showed the bottle only to him as if I didn't exist or my opinion didn't matter. In the end he brought the check and put it right in front of my bf!!! Although the table was big enough to put it in the middle and let us figure it out. It was very offensive. I can't believe it happened in New York in the 21st century. In fact my bf did pay for both of us this time because we were celebrating his new contract. But normally we split the amount.

There were over 40 different dishes, all of them very high in quality. There were caviar, pate, three types of smoked salmon, the most amazing butter, turkey, lamb tajine, and many many more.I had to give a 4 star as the cocktail menu has decreased drastically in size.

5.0,4/13/2017,"As Rachel S. said below, this was indeed a perfect experience!I visited Clement this February during Restaurant Week with three of my friends. The restaurant is located within a hotel, with a glamorous lobby and coat check, and we were led upstairs and seated by a window at a roomy table between two couples. The rest of the restaurant had a fair amount of patrons. The restaurant looked neat, modern, and classy.When we were approached with the menus, I must say I noted immediately that the waiter for the night was OUTSTANDING. Truly. He came over many times to make sure we were enjoying ourselves and asked about each meal. Don't get me wrong, though. He didn't do it an annoying way. All of our food was delicious and the bread they brought out was fresh from the back, not from a basket. However, I must say the highlight of the night was most definitely the dessert. We were brought out a small plate of chocolates to share, which were very good, and we each ordered our own desserts as per the RW menu. I ordered the hazelnut crunch bar and it...was... heavenly. THAT GOOD that I even asked the waiter if I could have one to go. I was completely willing to pay for it. However, he gave it to me on the house! I was surprised and so very delighted. It even came in a plastic container in a very nice Clement bag with fabric straps. Very classy! The experience overall was fantastic.

5.0,4/6/2017,"OOOooof.  OMG. What can I say?  It was a perfect dining experience.Our server was Marco and he was simply the best.  This was an experience where the service truly made the difference.  Don't get me wrong, the food was phenomenal.  We had a crudo dish that was out of this world.  But Marco?  He made the whole thing truly special.He asked if we'd like to order wine with our meal, and we said we did, but by the glass, and we weren't sure what to get, did he have suggestions?  And lo and behold, he simply says he'll handle it and disappeared.  Little did we know that this would mean we essentially had ad hoc wine pairings with our dinner.  He came back and poured us petite glasses of many unbelievable and (seemingly) rare wines that was such a fun and delectable experience.  I always have a hard time picking wines (indecisiveness is my jam) so this was perfect as it felt like a tiny surprise plus it removed the decision anxiety (mild thought it may be) that I might have suffered.  Huge plus.The dining room wasn't particularly full, but then again it was the Friday after Thanksgiving, so most folks were probably at home eating turkey and stuffing sammiches.  Their loss, our gain!  Marco really treated us with a warmth and kindness that is unparalleled.  If I lived in NYC I would make this my special occasion spot immediately.  Come eat at Clement, you can't go wrong!(As a side note, I will say that when the bartender came by to discuss cocktails with us, and I told him I like stiff bourbon or rye based cocktails, he had a tiny look of shock on his face that he recovered from, but it was clear that was the last thing he was expecting from me, a young white blonde woman.  To him I'll say only this: Dude.  It's 2017.  Women drink whiskey.

The oysters were all equally tasty. Salmon had a lovely crust and fleshy interior. My husband had the tuna as an appetizer and the seabass as an entree. With 2 glasses of wine (domestic Pinot Noir and French Sauvignon Blanc) and two desserts (baked apple and poached pear) our bill was $225.,0,0,0,Rosa C.,"Oceanside, NY",1,15,25
5.0,2/10/2017,"I had an amazing lunch here for Restaurant Week. I started with the Kale salad which was dressed to perfection, followed by the Zucca pasta for my main. The pasta was tasty and the serving was quite generous, I had a lot left to take home for a second meal. I ended with the Chocolate hazelnut crunch bar for dessert and it was absolutely delicious.Normally this is an expensive restaurant, so the prix fixe menu was quite a steal. The restaurant itself is stunning. Even though it's on the pricier side, I can see myself returning again purely based on the quality of the food and service.",3,0,2,Shalini S.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",116,17,25

I sat with a great bartender named chrisThe couple next to me was greatThey had 2 menus I was interested in the caviar selection but they were far too big for me. I opted for a shrimp flatbreadThat was huge. I only ate the shrimp off of it, had some chocolates and nuts... chris tried to talk me into the rooftop bar. Maybe next time. I got a tummy ache, and headed back to my car. Very friendly staff and decor, nice time.I love it when pretentious hotels have down to earth staff and surprise you!

5.0,1/31/2017,"Restaurant Week!! It's brilliant because it brings to light restaurants that you didn't know anything about. Would I have made it to Clement on my own? One will never know. But you know what? I am glad I made it. Every once in awhile I like taking care of numero uno! Moi! I decided today was the day to splurge and eat some perfectly prepared three courses!!! In the middle of a regular ol' Monday.I checked out the menu online and it was everything I wanted. I am pescatarian and with this menu I didn't have to alter anything which is ideal for both parties. And on this day they happen to change up the crudo to tuna. My oh my! I love tuna and it worked beautifully with the avocado and cucumber. It was a perfect balance of sweet, creamy and tangy! A perfect start to my meal.I was given two rolls and a perfect sphere of butter. I loved the grainy bread but I did get crumbs everywhere. The baby French baguette was perfect for snatching up the salmon caviar. The wait staff also used that special crumb catcher rod and made all those crumbs disappear.The main course was salmon on a bed of squash and seafood cream sauce. I was smitten with the hazelnut sprinkles. The fish was perfectly cooked! I could not have been happier with the dish. I might've needed one more roll for the sauce but I still managed getting most of it in my belly. The people next to me were uber proper and slowly bit each morsel. And the other table was working on the fish for over 40 minutes and barely made a dent. What can I say? I have an hour and I wasn't  wasting time or crumbs. The dessert was a decadent hazelnut chocolate crunch bar on a marmalade drizzle, a chocolate swirl, mandarins and a raspberry. Decadent. And I'm a huge fan or orange and chocolate.A perfect meal with great service! Thank you Clement! I will happily spread the word!",7,3,5,Carolina S.,"Brooklyn, NY",1761,623,8318
2.0,1/25/2017,"I was wearing a cap on a rainy day that we went to Clement for dinner. We were greeted by the hostess saying that ""This is a 5 star hotel/restaurant so no hats allowed."" I understand there is a ""smart casual"" dress code and everything, but I felt it was a bit rude and unwelcoming. Anyway I took off my cap and tried to enjoy my dinner with friends. Unfortunately the food was average at best. My main dish seared sea bass was a bit greasy and over-cooked, and the dessert apple cranberry tart was just alright. However it was a shock to me that we got served cold milk to go with our hot teas. Also we weren't particularly impressed with the wait staff. We were asked to pay the bill while we were still having tea, and the waiter who collected the signed bill picked it up and opened the bill presenter to see how much we tipped them right in front of us.

2.0,1/13/2017,"Whoa...4 starts as of the writing of this review?  Totally overrated.  The crowning virtue of the restaurant is its class and elegance.  The setting is very opulent and I felt like a 1%er lounging in Clement's opulent dining area as I waited for my guests to arrive.  If the food and service matched the decor this would be a 5 star review.  The food and service however was just average.  If I'm going to pay $30 for eggs Benedict, it should be at least above average which it wasn't.  The service was out of sync, the kind when they are hoovering asking how the food is when a minute hasn't even passed since they dropped it off, but they are no where to be found when the coffee needs to be refilled.  On top of that they committed what is probably my biggest service pet peeve in adding the gratuity automatically without mentioning it.  We were only a party of four so I didn't expect that of so I didn't notice until much later that I had double tipped, for mediocre service no less.",0,0,0,Sean M.,"Stamford, CT",77,62,4

I got the pumpkin ravioli, which was really tasty and well-made. Service is fantastic but is expected at a restaurant like this.

The different flowers they put on the tables are just beautiful.Their food is spot on, and has that refreshing taste in all their dishes which I love. Their presentation is always so delicate and beautiful, except for the beef bourguignon dish which was one of the daily specials. For that they give you three separate (mini)pots of beef, mashed potatoes and roasted vegetables, along with one big empty dish that they put in front of you, which was a bit weird and confusing to me.This will always be my go-to place to bring an out-of-town guest or to celebrate an occasion.",0,0,1,Jean K.,"Manhattan, NY",1,4,3

The tuna was fresh and delicious prepared in a citrus sauce. They also gave us a complimentary plate of beef tartar served in a waffle cup. I ordered lobster risotto for my entree and my friend had the salmon atop peas. Both tasted fabulous. I had a generous serving of perfectly cooked lobster and the risotto was seasoned to perfection. We ordered the basil ice cream and peach sorbet for dessert. They also presented me with a strawberry mousse cake for my birthday which was incredibly yummy.

The meal was amazing from beginning to the end (at least for me it was). What I enjoyed is that even though it was restaurant week, they didn't just make up some random dish and shove it down their customers' throats. They actually took dishes off of their regular menu so that we, as restaurant week goers, could experience the food the way they always serve it. Tuna crudo. Impeccably decorated on the place. Bright red and filled with freshness. My main.. Oh my main was the lamb shank. Mind you, I thought it was going to be a small little piece considering it's a nice restaurant and we're paying half the price. The lamb shank was super super delicious and filling on a bed of Israeli couscous. Also... Dessert was delicately presented. Satisfying yet wasn't too heavy. For me, the meal was amazing all the way through. Unfortunately, my cousin didn't think so. Although she liked her food, she thought that the halibut could have been a little more seasoned. True. I can second that. Also, one thing I have to say about the service is that I wish they didn't keep coming up to us every 5 minutes asking if we were done.

Wha?? Definitely won't visit again. 大地雷。Breakdowns: Went there for brunch. We ordered steak and eggs, burger, and softshell crab eggs Benedict entrees, and avocado toast and lobster tartine appetizers. The lobster was excellent, but the rest were mediocre. The ketchup and the tiny bottle of Tabasco were the highlight of my meal. Food wise, 3 outta 5 stars.We had a party of 4 adults + a kid. Some of us were late so the early arrivals sat and waited for the rest. The waiters came by every minute to ask us if we were ready to order. duh? The wait staff then started to ignore us after all arrived. It was so incredibly difficult to get their attention. Ordering, getting utensils, plates, napkins (that were suppose to there in the first place), dessert menu, and the check was like pulling teeth. And the wait staff act as if it were doing us a favor. I was fed up at the end and walked to the register to ask for the check, stood there while the check printed, and credit card swiped. Service wise, 1 outta 5 stars.

4.0,8/10/2015,"** Restaurant Week Summer 2015 Review ** I've been to Fives in the Peninsula Hotel before - it was actually my very first Restaurant Week meal back when I was still a teenager. When I heard a new restaurant, Clement, had replaced it, I was instantly interested. And better, it was on the Restaurant Week list! For my appetizer, I chose the Green Asparagus with crispy hen egg and lemon. The dish was very good - very light and refreshing for a hot summer day. Clement cooks their poached eggs sous vide style inside the shell before cracking it onto a spoon. This equals a smoother and silkier poached egg, which was effortless to pop. The Boyfriend chose the Fluke Crudo with white soy, grapefruit gel, and rice cracker. I had a bit of his fluke crudo and just like my appetizer, it was light and refreshing. The grapefruit really helps open up the appetite. For my entrée, I had the Fresh Tagliatelle with roasted mushrooms, parmesan, and sherry essence. The pasta itself wasn't the best that I've had - it didn't taste like it was made in-house. The mushroom and parmesan sauce, however, was very good. I liked that they used an assortment of mushrooms, since each tastes slightly different with a different mouth-feel. The Boyfriend had the Clement Burger with brioche bun, spicy mustard, and fries. The burger was pretty tasty - but not the best burger we've both had. It tastes very good with the spicy mustard so make sure you slather some on before taking a bite! The fries were thin and crispy and a very generous portion. The burger would probably be the biggest portion size on the RW menu if you're a big eater. For dessert, we both had the Peach Almond Tart with salted caramel and mascarpone ice cream. The tart shell was pretty hard (and slightly difficult to eat) but the filling was very good. It tasted even better with a scoop of ice cream, which wasn't too sweet and complimented the slightly tart flavor of the peaches. Service was very attentive. We had coffee at the end of our meal (2 cups actually!) and weren't rushed to leave even though we were the last ones left in the restaurant. The coffee is very good and you get unlimited refills - but just a heads up, it is $9 a cup. All in all, Clement is a very solid Restaurant Week lunch.",0,0,0,Michelle T.,"New York, NY",367,1165,1125
3.0,8/9/2015,"I hate to give unflattering reviews on places with such a welcoming presence and dedicated service, but unfortunately I have a few remarks about the food that led me to give a three star rating. Although the food was ok, that's really all I can say about it. I had the farmers omelette and found it to be dry and lacking much taste. Definitely needed some salt and ketchup.  SK had the pancakes which were pleasant, but it think it's pretty difficult to mess these up. I do have to compliment them on their avocado spread on artisan bread, that was delicious! It salvaged the meal for me. The desserts were also unmemorable. The creme brûlée had more of an airy feel to it like whipped egg whites, instead of a creamy dense custard I was hoping for. They did make up for it however with delectable hazelnut petit fours. I would give this place another chance, perhaps I was unlucky with my dish choices.

I wanted to try everything, so it was a good thing Phil doesn't mind sharing!  He started with hen egg  and I had the fluke crudo.  Both were exquisitely prepared and presented.  He then chose very well with a perfectly cooked, lightly breaded monkfish and I had freshly made tagliatelle (expertly al dente) in a mushroom sauce (not too heavy and to die for).  We ate every last bite and then some.  Peach tart to finish was deliciously fresh and proportioned well.  All dishes were the perfect size -enough to savor but leaving you wanting one more bite.  The decor is serene in a subtle palette with beautiful fresh flowers on every table.  Tables were well spaced and we were seated in a large corner banquette where conversation was private and we barely needed to speak above a whisper to have a conversation.The service was fantastic!  As we were trying to get a decent angle for a selfie the waitstaff came over and handily took two shots that turned out quite nicely.  They were attentive to our needs without hovering.  This gem is perfect in every way.I can't wait to go back!",0,0,0,Leisle L.,"Manhattan, NY",0,12,7

After all, this is a high class restaurant. We did the NYC Restaurant Week Prix Fixe Dinner Menu, and unlike most restaurants, we were not rushed at all. The server took his time explaining the dishes and he allowed us an adequate amount of time in between courses. He came by to check on us from time to time and I just loved the fact that our glasses were never empty. That tells a lot about the quality of service.Coincidentally, my girlfriends and I ordered different things from the menu so we got to try everything and, to my astonishment, everything was fantastic! The dessert sealed the deal. In all, great food and great service... Definitely coming back!",1,1,1,Amanda C.,"Brooklyn, NY",364,98,198
5.0,7/26/2015,"Perfect pick for NYC restaurant week. The restaurant is located in the landmark Peninsula Hotel. As soon as you walk in, you know this place is classy with a capital C - I was definitely way underdressed. Cool decor with mirrors, fresh flowers at the table, nice lighting. The first thing I noticed once I was seated is the amount of space around me. The tables are not close together....so it feels very roomy.I selected the asparagus with egg for my starter and the tagliatelle with mushrooms for the entree (from their restaurant week menu). Dessert was a peach tart with vanilla ice cream. See pictures below - food was as delicious as it looked. Everything tasted fresh. The pasta was perfectly cooked and I loved the white sauce. Finally, the staff is very friendly here.

The drink was very good, probably on par with Middle Branch and Donna (not as good as Happiest Hour and Randolph Brooklyn).

What surprised me more was the variety of food they were serving on their menu (burgers, fish, lobster rolls?!). It was SO SCRUMPTIOUS. Kudos to Chef Brandon Kida and his team.Dishes I recommend:-Avocado Toast - huge pieces of sourdough toast and lots and lots of avocado. Can feed 4 comfortably-Oysters (Long Island): I've had plenty of oysters but what made this one so amazing was the sauce they put on top. Highly recommended.-Clement Burger - huge huge huge-Lobster Roll - 1lb lobster served on a croissant with fries. I really enjoyed the ketchup they used for the fries. It was Sir Kensington's Ketchup. Best ketchup I've ever had. It's has a mix taste of that shrimp cocktail sauce + ketchup.Drinks: They have a section on the menu called Designated Drivers (for you non-alcoholics). I loved the drink Clement (guava, pom, lime, agave). It was fruity just the way I like it. I also got the try the other two, Lucille and Hiss & Weekes. They are all so good but I declare Clement the winner.Dessert: We got three desserts:-Pumpkin (gingersnap crust, dried fruits compote, pumpkin ice cream) = yay-Pear (brown butter cake, caramel chantilly, pistachio ice cream) = WINNER-Bowl of berries (wow they gave a HUGE helping of berries and whipped cream)Service: Great servers at Clement!

I personally loved the scallops with the grapefruit juice, but my girlfriend thought the scallops were overcooked and questioned the grapefruit combination. Then came our main courses, poached lobster on top of cheese grits and white asparagus, and salt-crusted wagyu steak, potatoes, mushrooms on top of the garlic salt was well seasoned, had flavor, but unfortunately, I had better steaks at other restaurants. I feel like it was one of those dishes that tried too much. amazing steak does not sauce! When you pay 60 bucks for 6 ounces of steak, the steak deserves to be compared to some of the best you ever had.

4.0,9/11/2014,"KenScale: 8.5/10Hotel restaurants are always a tricky proposition. There are some great hotel restaurants with acclaimed chefs, but at the end of the way hotels don't really need quality control to attract diners snice they already have guests who will show up no matter what. I've tried to stay away from hotel restaurants (with some notable exceptions like The NoMad or Locanda Verde). Recently, I found another restaurant that belongs to the rare list of great hotel restaurants in the city. Located on the second floor of the Peninsula Hotel, Clement has that refined elegance from chef Brandon Kida's kitchen, featuring New American cuisine with global influences, that made me wonder why this place hasn't caught much buzz since its opening. Is it the stigma of being a hotel restaurant or a rather pricey menu? I honestly don't know but there were a lot of dishes to like.I showed up with in a group of three and ordered three starters and three entrees. Oysters were really fresh and juicy, well balanced with mignonette and sea salt. I was also a huge fan of the texture of octopus that came with chickpeas. Mushroom came with rice, green strawberries and pine to create a delightful dish as well. Often, the texture of lobster can be tricky to balance, but the one at Clement was near perfection, especially when combined with grits and zucchini that came along with it. I wish the sea bass that came with duck broth and maitake mushroom used slightly less seasoning because otherwise the fish was perfectly cooked. The winner of the night was lamb that came with miso, eggplant and rhubarb. The meat was absolutely juicy and tender and the surrounding vegetables made for a wonderful dish with great balance in flavor. Desserts were also quite delightful. Chocolate s'mores with Graham cracker disc and light ganache was pure decadence, although I liked the light touch of eton mess semifreddo that came with half frozen strawberry slightly better.The restaurant was half empty on a weekday night, which surprised me given the high quality of food coming out of the kitchen. Getting a reservation shouldn't be an issue. The dining room has a bit stuffy atmosphere (not surprising for a hotel restaurant with white tablecloth) but the service was professional. The restaurant has a full bar with extensive wine menu. There is also a bar area next to the dining room with a lot of work people stopping by to unwind after a long day.

The entrees were also tops, especially the sea bass and one of the best short ribs I have had.  The short ribs were very tender with a delicious sauce.The desserts were on the small side.  The s'mores was good with lots of chocolate.  Their variation of strawberry shortcake came up short.  It was small, and very pedestrian.  Not sure if the bread and pastry come from the same area, but they need some work.The waitstaff was very accommodating and professional. Some were very friendly, and some were a bit more stand-offish.  Still, they paid attention to customer needs.  More than willing to adjust menus for dietary issues.  Also, when they saw I enjoyed my decaf coffee, they left the pot on the table, which was appreciated.The atmosphere is elegant.  Lovely room.  Nice view of Fifth Avenue.  Quiet.  Perfect for a special date or a business meal.I look forward to returning.",0,0,0,Randall S.,"Manhattan, NY",837,109,13

I was pleasantly surprised that it was Restaurant Week, although I would expect a few more people than were there. This is definitely a working lunch kind of establishment being in a hotel, establishing a demure atmosphere in the restaurant area, and having mirrors everywhere as decorations. I felt more than slightly uncomfortable dining by myself. Luckily the place filled more as lunchtime went on.The food was meh to me. All the flavors were good, but the dishes didn't quite work for one reason or another. The warm corn salad was well seasoned and almost melted in my mouth; but the accompanying warm blueberries added an acidity that didn't go with the rest of the dish. I found myself eating just the blueberries and then going back to enjoy the rest of the dish.My main was the Black Sea Bass. This is personal preference, but I had noticeable chunks of sea salt on the skin that overwhelmed the taste of the delicate fish. I noticed when I ate pieces of fish without skin, I was much better able to appreciate the subtlety of the peking duck broth that came with it.Dessert was a deconstructed s'more. Really, I'd call it chocolate 3 ways. The density of the ganache overwhelmed me with chocolate. I wish they had made the disc of ganache not as deep because the amount of vanilla ice cream was not enough to thin out the many layers of chocolate.I'd like to come back during dinner since the bar looked good. The wine list here wasn't extensive, but the mixed cocktail menu looked enticing. The food here was good but unremarkable, but I'd still consider coming back before an event in the theatre district.",2,0,2,Kimberly C.,"San Marino, CA",28,405,176
2.0,7/2/2014,"Food was well presented but not very good.  The flavors were poorly mixed, not complementing one another at all.  Ambience was poor, the noise from the bar was overwhelming, the manager loudly berated our server right beside our table for not getting a check quickly enough to another table. For the price, the experience was underwhelming.  The single positive in the meal were the desserts, all very tasty.",1,0,0,David M.,"Fort Collins, CO",0,5,0
5.0,5/6/2014,"This is a Five Star dinning experience, and is a must try for a Fifth Avenue, elegant dinner. The level of service is outstanding. The food by Chef Brandon Kida is outrageously delicious and artfully presented.  The restaurant is new, but will quickly become an iconic NYC attraction.",1,0,0,L Z.,"New York, NY",0,3,0

5.0,12/29/2013,"Haven't eaten here but visit this bar for cocktails often... Absolutely beautiful decor, dim lighting, very hip and romantic.  Classic and great service. Can be pricey but well worth it to hang here.  The cocktails are made well and the selection is wonderful.  Really enjoy sitting here and relaxing for a few evening cocktails.  The decor is elegant yet modern and the arches, marble, and soft lighting making for a wonderful feeling and place to relax.",0,0,0,Lyndsey C.,"Sterling, VA",238,986,215
3.0,12/29/2013,"This is the lounge/bar in the Peninsula (turn left when you walk in), and it was there when I needed it. Tried to find a spot at King Cole bar with no luck, so I walked to the Peninsula on a friend's suggestion to grab a drink and warm up. Snagged a little table and the friendly server provided me with some water and a menu. I ordered an old fashioned, which was pretty good, but not $22 good. Still, I enjoyed it, and I did get warm. Was probably only there for 20 minutes or so, but the clientele were quite posh. Probably wouldn't frequent this place dressed as casually (jeans, sweater, coat) in the future, but if I wanted a fancy night in this district then I might hit it up for fancy wine and dinner.",1,0,0,Scott G.,"Austin, TX",646,218,243
4.0,12/15/2013,"overall I thought the food was superb quality, perfectly cooked and interesting flavor combinations.  Top it all off with large portions for the price and you can see why I gave it four stars.  We had the 5 course tasting menu and every dish, but especially the three fishes courses, were amazing.  The only reason not to give it 5 stars is that service was exceedingly slow.  We were glad we didn't decide on the 8 course tasting menu or we might still be there.  In any event it took way too long between each course.  Nevertheless, I would defintiely go back because the food and overall value were excellent but we would only return when we had unlimited time to linger.",1,1,0,Larry S.,"Manhattan, NY",0,16,0
3.0,11/22/2013,"Brand new restaurant, brand new concept. I have had Chef Brandon's food in Asiate twice. Both times they were above average at best. When I heard news that the old Five's restaurant   is transforming itself to a more contemporary out take, I was excited. Different themes within the restaurant. How many places in NYC actually does this? The first ""room"" was like a library, second was full of mirrors and third seems to be the party room. Cool atmosphere.We started our meals with fuji water, then my friends ordered cocktails. It took over 20 minutes for the cocktails to arrive... the place did not look busy enough for this much delay... Our appetizers took a while as well. One memorable appetizer was the scallop degustation. It is scallops two ways: ceviche style with grapefruit and seared with lardon. I would eat the seared scallop first since it is heavier and finish with the scallop ceviche since the grapefruit refreshes your palates. As for entree, I had the black bass with peking duck broth... the flavors were good. Great dish. But what I don't understand is why was the peking duck broth used on a fish dish instead of using a fish fumet/bouillabaisse? It would have made a lot more sense... I feel like the ingredients are just plated together... without an actual connection to each other. The lobster with kobacha squash was awesome though. Loved it. The desserts were awesome. I loved the pastry chef's play on a ""deconstructed"" peanut butter and jelly. The caramel with thyme ice cream was awesome too! That thyme ice cream is really different, in a good way. The plating were exciting and shows finesse. Good food. But one downside is that the service was ridiculously slow. It took them one hours to refill our water glass again... and the third time we had to ask! It is either the servers/runners are not attentive enough or they are just that lazy. I think this place is aiming for 3 stars in NYT... even if the food is 3 star quality, the service will definitely drag it down. In no way is this service on par with Asiate.",2,0,1,Jason L.,"Brooklyn, NY",149,52,20
