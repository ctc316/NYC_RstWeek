I'm obviously wouldn't fight them over $.33, and they think I probably don't check (thankfully I keep my restaurant receipts because it's not the first time a restaurant has tipped themselves more than I wrote down).

1.0,10/9/2018,"This has been one of the worse gastronomical experiences I've ever had. Being in NYC and in such a great location it ended up being utterly disappointing. Me and my fiancé ordered tortellini, and here's a full detail of what was wrong with it.1) it was supposed to have bacon. There was NO bacon flavor or pieces2) it was COLD3) basically had NO salt4) the sauce was supposed to be a cheese sauce and it was crumbly and tasted like Mac & cheese.5) tortellini were supposed to be with ricotta, and it had no flavor of ricotta due to the overpowering of the Mac & cheese.6) the pasta were VERY chewy.Overall, We've  never had such a bad experience on an a restaurant with such a simple plate. I did let them know my feedback and they did not charge for either of the dishes. ohh the bread was chewy and the olive oil tasted too oily, evidently poor quality.

1.0,8/28/2018,"Worst impression and very upsetting. 2 things happened:(1) I reserved a business lunch meeting 2 weeks in advance. The restaurant called me the day before my business meeting to cancel my reservation due to some last-minute renovation. When I asked for more details (given that I have to reorganize my business meeting, I'd like to at least let my meeting invitees know why I need to change on them at the last minute), the staff told me ""it's just a thing, some regular process"". This is quite annoying that they cannot plan the regular maintenance better and block off reservation ahead of time or let me know a week earlier. They have to wait till the day before, and now I have to scramble around to find another venue for my business meeting. (2) When they called to cancel, they called me 3 times: 1st time, they looked for me and we chatted. 2nd time they looked for someone else, so I told them they got the wrong number and that I just spoke to them. 3rd time (30 seconds later), they called again, so I told them this is the 3rd time they dialed my number.

And after 6 pm, $1 oysters.I chose a Rose (honestly cannot remember as there was a selection of 6) which was $15 (yes prices are steep as you're paying for Rock Center) and shared the chicken empanadas ($15 for 3 teeny empanadas--so skimpy and overpriced).So why the 4 stars?

Morrell's is conveniently located just across the street from Rockefeller center. It has a small but nice outdoor seating area shielded from the crowds by privacy hedges. It also has a beautiful two story interior with a nice bar. The happy hour wasn't limited to sitting inside at the bar only so we took advantage of the warm weather and sat outside.  We both ordered a drink and app off the happy hour menu.

2.0,12/3/2017,We order d from the Bites And Small Plates menus - The good: truffle devil eggs... YUMService was excellent The mediocre/ needs improvement- the lobster for the lobster rolls was decent but the brioche to lobster ratio gave you a large bite of bread and little lobster Crab bites were more filling than crab and I like more crab than filling- the real way a crab cake is made The bad - the wine prices for anything decent are ridiculous. $60 for a glass of Peter Michel Chardonnay?  Seriously you'd have to drink 4 glasses of the cheaper not so good wines (aka be drunk) to then pay 3 times the price for a good Chardonnay. Same with reds- the good wines were priced 3-4 times higher than restaurant prices. More bad- beet salad - dressing was so tart even a lemon would picker up and the beets were flavorless The steak Christine were thick slaps of beef nearly impossible to bite so we tried to cut with a knife and they were too tough to cut. Resorted to trying to chew  a bite off but the amount of horseradish and other seasoning was so overwhelming we decided to not torture ourselves any longer. At the very least you'd expect the steak to be chopped or thinly sliced so it could be the finger food it's supposed to be... but then the taste would have to be edible.

We sat outside on a perfect late summer afternoon. The potted hedge row did an effective job of providing ample privacy from the street traffic. Our waiter was professional and nice. Most importantly, The food was excellent.  We had the butternut squash soup of the day, a very generous portion of mixed green salad to which was added grated Parmesan cheese and balsamic vinaigrette dressing.  What was truly wonderful however was the soba noodles with scallops. It included sliced jalapeños, shrimp, cilantro and it was outstanding. The small size was plenty for one person for lunch. All good.   Where Morrell fell down a bit was on pricing and busboy service. Granted this is Rockefeller Center and the rents are sky high, but everything on the menu was way overpriced. As for the busboys, they seem so preoccupied with snatching patrons' plates off the tables.  Twice they pulled dishes we were still using off the table and twice I asked them to give me back the plate.  It's very annoying.

3.0,7/14/2017,"I've been eating here for as long as they've been in the Rock Center area, since my office is right around the corner.  A close friend is a wine aficionado, and there have been countless afternoons where we go there for a glass of wine before we repair to our respective homes and spouses.   He pours and smells and swirls and gurgles and waxes on prosaic about the clove and the blackberry and the whatever he tastes in that first sip, and I'm sad to say that I'm immune to those nuances- it's just a damn good tasting glass of wine.  Suffice it to say they have an overwhelming selection of excellent pours.      The food.  Perhaps I'm Draconian in my evaluations, but I think they've changed chefs?  I don't love it as much as I used to.  Gone is the earth movingly delicious kale salad ( yes- you read that right), with large kale leaves tender from an oil massage, combined with toasted sunflower seeds and cubes of roasted squash.  Oh- it was divine.  Then there was the trio of tartares, with tuna and salmon AND beef, and it was the richness of the proteins plus the variety that made the dish.  It's now been relegated to the duos, and I miss the trio.   The charcuterie plate appears abstemious, but the richness of the meats - duck rillette, sausage, pate, plus delightful little crackers, whole grain mustard, cornichon, and olives- makes the portion ideal.  The crab stuffed mushrooms need reevaluation, as they were pointedly unexciting.   Onion tart?  - I suggest they parbake the crust before adding the caramelized onions, as the bottom crust was soggy and it can be avoided.  On this past visit I ordered the tuna salad Nicoise, and asked for extra  lettuce.   They didn't bring enough, and when I mentioned it, no less than two servers brought extra greens.  They're very service oriented in here, and that's a definite plus.  It's my go- to place to take clients.  I recommend it for either tourists or locals.",0,0,0,Diana S.,"Manhattan, NY",10,17,1

The service has been outstanding everytime regardless of how busy they are! During our most recent trip to Morell's we had the pleasure of being served by Alessia (or Sia as she prefers to be called). She was by far the best bartender we have been served by here or anywhere else!! She was incredibly personable and had an excellent knowledge of the 70+ wines that they offer. She also was well-rounded in her knowledge of the whiskeys​ and bourbons they sell. We lucked out that it was a slow night and she was able to spend alot of time with us. She helped my wife pick out the perfect wine pairing for the food she ordered (the duck breast which I will add was cooked perfectly). Sia went out of her way to make sure our night was very memorable and relaxing! It is very rare to find such a well-rounded bartender/wine expert and we couldn't have been happier with the experience that Sia provided for us!

The other employee at the bar was an Asian woman,  who we later learned was the wine manager or something, was also engrossed in a conversation with three men sitting at the bar.  We couldn't get anyone's attention to get service.  Everything else they had going on was way more important that serving us.Finally when we got service the glass of wine we chose tasted old as it the wine was opened days ago.  We politely asked when the wine was opened and he had no idea.  We asked how they do quality control so that if a customer asked such a question they could tell them it was fresh or not.  He had no answer!  We asked for a new glass of wine for each of us and for a new bottle to be opened.  He had such an attitude about the entire thing. Instead of giving us the new pour in a fresh and dry glass, he poured the wine into wet glasses.  I guess he thought he'd  show us!As we left I asked to speak to a manger.  The hostess went to the Asian woman behind the bar and she came over to speak to us.  She was the wine manager apparently.  I explained how our service had gone and that she herself ignored us too.  I didn't need an apology but rather wanted her  or management to know that our experience was awful and we wouldn't be back but they should definitely work on things.  If this is how business there is run, I can't imagine they'd have much repeat business.  Maybe they don't care about repeat business since it's NYC.  Either way....

I could not be more disappointed in how we were treated and how something so minor turned into a problem. We ordered appetizers, soups and then the entrees. This is where the first issue came up but not the last. It took close to 30 minutes to get three soups, one seafood salad, a plate of roasted veggies, and a crostini dish. As someone who was personally in the food and service industry, these kind of dishes take 5-10 minutes tops to prepare and send out.At this point our waiter noticed that we were getting kind of agitated. He said he knows it's taking longer than expected and that he's on top of the chef. Usually on a crowded night with a lot of people this would not bother me, but it was a Thursday night....the best part? we were the only table eating food. This is what drove me crazy.After we finished the apps we expected the waiter to be ""on top"" of the chef getting our main dishes out faster...Another 30 minutes went by where we actually had to call the waiter over again to ask what was going on. He then goes to the kitchen for 10 mins. At this point the continuity of the meal was lost. We were all saying this is taking far too long and most likely they forgot to put the order in.After 35-40 mins waiting for the entrees they finally bring what we ordered.Our table ordered a tenderloin dish, pan seared duck breast, a pasta dish , hanger steak, and a short rib dish. This is where everything went south... As soon as the food came down my brother cut into his tenderloin to find it over cooked to well done (ordered medium rare) and cold. My sisters pasta dish was ice cold. The duck was cold and my short rib was burned, almost charred and dry. The only meal that was somewhat decent was the steak. We ended up sending the tenderloin and pasta back immediately and two of us decided to keep our dishes because we were so hungry. They even tried to re-cook the dishes and bring it back to us even though we told them repeatedly not to... it was well past the point. Even after sending the dishes back and complaining about the others, the waiter never came to check on us or to do anything about the situation. How about offering us something else on the menu? Something?!!??? Anything!???! It was like he was hiding from us.You would think after sending back 2 of the 5 meals  immediately and then telling them that 4 out of 5 of the meals were cold that the restaurant manager would come out... Wrong!! No one came to offer us anything or to even apologize. When we asked the waiter where the manager was and why he didn't even bother to show his face he said that he asked for him to come but he didn't... that is not something you say to a paying customer. After seeing how upset we were about the whole ordeal, he then reluctantly offers to go ""summon the manager"" again.

3.0,1/6/2017,Not quite sure how I feel about this place. My sister and I were visiting Rockefeller and we decided to drop by here late afternoon for a wine and cocktail before heading back out. They have about 5 cocktail options and both of the ones we ordered weren't available. That was disappointing since the drinks sounded like they would have had great potential. So then we opted for a Argentinian Malbec and a Pinot Grigio. Both the Malbec and Pinot Grigio were rather dry and almost stale. For how expensive this place is I was disappointed with the options and the drinks provided. On the other hand service here is a 5 star.

The prices at this place blew me away. I was honestly shocked. I don't mind expensive food and a good cocktail but these were obviously obnoxious prices because they are across from the tree. If I get a $20 glass of wine (some went up to $59) THIS WAS PER GLASS NOT BOTTLE, I expect the wine glass to at least be clean, which it wasn't. There was also no soap in the bathroom which we told the hostess about several times and she never moved from her hostess stand to do anything about it, meanwhile we were watching the employees use that bathroom which meant they also weren't using soap (EW). The place drew me in because there were tables outside where you could sit on a mild night and see the tree while having a glass of wine but it was raining when we went so that wasn't an option.

We ordered a bottle of wine and our server Jessica B. didn't pour wine ONCE after the initial tasting/pour.

When we saw this across the street, it looked like a lovely place to sit & relax. It wasn't cold so while they did have indoor seats, we sat outside in the little courtyard. We were seated immediately, brought menus & water and then asked about drinks. We ordered margaritas off a specialty fall cocktail list. 20 minutes later we still didn't have our drinks and hadn't been able to order any food. Around us we saw people being served. In true New Yorker Fashion, my mother finally couldn't take it and stood up and told them she didn't even want the margaritas anymore. Apparently they were missing an ingredient and rather than talk to us they were freaking out for twenty minutes leaving us waiting. The manager wound up offering us glasses of wine on the house but we were a bit over it at that point. We finally ordered food and even that was a bit confusing. My sisters dish didn't match the menu description at all and my soup of the day was different than what they told me it was. My truffle deviled eggs were good but my moms steak salad was by far the best choice and had flavorful pieces of beautiful rare steak, blue cheese, avocado, red onion, etc. That was our win from this meal. We were honestly so let down that the hour that we had to relax and enjoy time together became a negative hot mess of an experience.

I went to Morrell's for a few drinks before getting dinner there with friends.  The wine I had (and unfortunately cannot remember the name of) was very good, I have no complaints with the alcohol.  Now, everyone I had dinner with said that their food was good, but nothing to rave about.  My friends had the Greek Salad, English Pea Risotto and the Mushroom Fettuccini and from what I could tell, everyone was satisfied with their dishes and everything tasted fine.  I had the short rib.   Of the three short ribs on the plate, two of them were pure fat, no meat whatsoever.  Now some people like fat on there meat, I am not one of those people though.  I think it's nice for meat to cook in its own fat, but it's not something I enjoy eating on the finished product.  Nor do I think it should compose 2/3's of my entire meal.  Other than that, the dish was flavored nicely, but there was something additional scattered on the plate, which tasted fine, but looked kind of strange and had a strange texture.  Still cannot place what that was.  With all that said, I feel that three stars is warranted, especially given the cost of dinner.  Morrell's is very expensive, and I'm super disappointed that my dinner fell way short of expectations.  That being said, I don't think I'll be getting dinner there again any time soon.",0,0,0,Sara W.,"East Rutherford, NJ",89,222,272

My server, Roman, was polite, very intelligent, incredibly attentive, and made sure I had everything I needed at any given time.

5.0,4/25/2015,What can I say...the wine selection is wonderful and the wine is truly divine. The food is also on par and I could probably eat here every night and day.

4.0,3/18/2015,"On a recent trip to the city to take in a show, we needed a place for dinner and cocktails. I  had been to Morrell once before but only for cocktails so I knew I  wanted to come back to try the food. We were seated immediately which came as a shock because it was a Saturday, almost Spring-like day in the heart of Rockefeller Center.We were seated in an excellent booth toward the back of the restaurant and water came out promptly. Because of the time of day there were only a few small-plate options available, but we were assured that the dinner menu would be available shortly. While we enjoyed our drinks, we tried the deviled eggs and the warm olives as well as the four-cheeses plate. All were very good and I especially like the warm olives.Conversation was easy and the decor of the restaurant was very tasteful. Seating was very comfortable and there was ample room on the table for the rest of the food we were to order. In addition to our opening assortment of small-plates, we were given new menus for dinner and we added to our palette: Duo tartar, Mini Steak Sandwich, Pork Tacos, Herb Chicken, Crabshrooms and the Onion Tart. All of the food came out hot and was really very good. Prices were reasonable and we were not hurried through our meal.I was very impressed by the martini I was served- just right. And coming from the Patron Saint of the Martini-- you know that counts for a lot.Morrell is great for small groups or couples or even to just come in for a cocktail at the bar.

The girls liked the recommended sweet moscato and amaretto sour. I found my gin&tonic to be really strong, so if you like it strong then go for it!

1.0,10/23/2014,"I was all set to give this place a really good review. I went in on a rainy afternoon for a snack and a warming glass of red wine. It is a friendly, international feel, and the kind of place you don't feel awkward going alone. Asked two questions about wine, and the bartender knew what he was talking about. He had me taste two before ordering. Had a tasty cheese plate too. Then I got my bill. On then itemized bill it said wine $20 cheese $20, for a total with tax of about $44.  Okay. I almost just signed and went on my way, but when I looked at the sheet to sign, it had been rung up for $63. No explanation. They get a lot of non Americans there, and if they weren't as familiar with our money would they have noticed?  I almost didn't notice. I pointed it out to the bartender who mumbled ""sorry"" and re-rang it. No explanation. I told the maître d as I left who sort of apologized. I DO NOT trust this place now.

Deviled eggs were pleasantly good without being over ""trufflley"", pappardelle was the real winner as this is my favorite pasta dish and they did it to perfection. Lunch portion was also just the right size. Creme brulee was a nice touch but after the first two courses a bit much. Wine was great - although at $27 a glass, it was quite the markup.

4.0,8/22/2014,"I recently had lunch here and ordered from the 3-course prix fix menu for $28 pp, which isn't a bad deal at all. It's almost like Restaurant Week, but instead of just two weeks out of the year, they offer it every day here for lunch. The prix fix menu is pretty limited but the options are all what I would find appealing so no complaints on that end. I opted for the Black Truffle Deviled Eggs, Wild Mushroom Pappardelle and Creme Brulee. In all honesty, it was good, but not the kind of great that I would go home and dream about later. The wait staff was professional and attentive but it was the hostess that won me over. She was the most sweetest person ever. I was meeting a friend here for lunch on his birthday, and I had called in advance to arrange desserts but she didn't know if I was the birthday girl, or I was the one who had called, so it was very sweet how she took extra caution when we arrived not to give it away while still trying to figure out who the surprise was for.

The menu is simple and offers a lot of Italian food. we had deviled eggs with truffle. It was nice, but paying $7 for four deviled egg makes me feel a bit queasy.

4.0,6/17/2014,"This is one of my favorite wine bars in the area. Despite the location I've always managed to have a delightful time, I imagine that's because the tourists aren't in here ever. Their wine selection by the glass is fabulous, and their bottle list (though I've never splurged) is extensive as well. They also carry a full bar, which is great for those of your party who perhaps don't enjoy wine. They have a delicious Barolo for $23 which feels like a treat. When I went a few months ago they also had a Brunello for $25 which was a real steal.I've had a few appetizers here with a friend over the winter, everything was tasty but it's really the wine that I remember. It's a nice place to relax in the later evening when the majority of the crowds have dissipated. An excellent option for an aftershow drink if you don't mind walking a few aves to get out of the tourist zone. Rockefeller is mostly dead at night which is fantastic.The afterwork crowd however can get quite daunting.

4.0,8/4/2013,"I frequent the wine shop and I love the selection there, so I've been wanting to try the café for awhile. Went for Restaurant Week with a bunch of girls from work. We had a great time. Seated quickly at a table outside on a spectacularly temperate summer day, wine was brought out right away (a very nice rosé - I swear I'm not trying to rhyme, it's just happening that way and I can't make it stop)!Good bread, delicious olive oil. I am one of those people who always fills up on too much bread but I tried to control myself. For the first course on the restaurant pri-fixe, most of us had the deviled eggs. One person had the salad, which looked pretty standard, not a lot of pomp, but she said it was good. The deviled eggs were amazing EXCEPT for the pork crackling on top. I normally would not object to pork crackling under any circumstances, but it just overpowered the delicate truffle egg filling and sort of mucked up the texture.Next, many of us had the carbonara, which was also very good except for one element, that it came with an ever-so-slightly poached egg on top, which is a clever idea; instead of breaking the raw egg into the hot pasta while it's still in the pan, as is customary in a carbonara, the diner breaks the egg in the bowl and mixes it in. It's a clever concept, but the problem is whites. Egg whites, to be exact. This method causes cooked egg white to mingle with the pasta and makes the texture a bit soupy. Other than that small problem, this carbonara tasted absolutely amazing and I could have eaten a giant vat of it. But I would ask that my egg be mixed in completely raw before serving to avoid that pesky egg white situation.The creme brulee was absolutely perfect. The shell was like glass and there was tons of vanilla bean swirling throughout the custard. The butterscotch pudding was ""nice"" and you know how I feel about ""nice,"" or maybe you don't, but I think you do now. (It was a bit boring.) The chocolate truffles looked lovely but I didn't try one, so I can't weigh in on those.I would definitely come back to Morrell to try their regular menu.

The Smoked Salmon Sandwich were like two large towers I had to climb and conquer, the sandwich itself was amazing, who can beat cream cheese, cucumbers and smoked salmon, but they need to work on the bread, it was a little hard. If I had a grandma that would make butterscotch pudding then I could say that this is exactly how it tasted, but I don't, so safe to say, it was delicious and tasted like someone else's grandma made it.

3.0,4/22/2013,"I really wanted to like this place a lot but I think they were off their game last night. The staff was very friendly but service was mediocre. One of our glasses had a chip in it. I mean come on. Inspecting your glassware is bar tending 101. I also had to keep hailing down the bar tender even though the place wasn't that busy. But he was a friendly gentleman and I liked him. Now for the grub. The veal tartar was tasty and so were the pulled pork tacos. Playful little snacks served perfectly with little crostini. Loved that. The risotto on the other hand was bland, watery and cold by the time it made its way to us. I've never sent anything back in my life but that one I felt was just unacceptable. I've made risotto a dozen times and there was no reason for that abomination to make it out of anyone's kitchen and find its way onto a plate. We ordered the duo of tar tars as a replacement. The tuna was superb. It had a nice toasted sesame thing going on there. The salmon tar tar however left something to be desired. It needed a little zip to counter act the rich butteriness of the salmon. I'd just like to say that everything there was generally under seasoned so they need to fix that up. It has a great atmosphere and its in a great location. Very sexy place inside. But honestly, they need to get it together over there. They certainly did not wow me last night.

They do have a really extensive wine list (uh- as they should being attached to a wine store and all!). We had a hard time deciding on a bottle of red, but our server was gracious enough to ""sneak"" us a couple of tasters so we could decide (we ended up with a delicious shiraz). I would recommend ordering a couple of small/large plates & sharing. There were four of us so we did that and got to taste a little bit of everything. I really enjoyed the spinach tomato and mimolette crostini and the sweet corn risotto with shrimp. Both had good flavor but were light enough you don't feel stuffed.  I also tried the cold poached salmon and thought that was good as well - the salmon was cooked perfectly. The truffle deviled eggs were so-so. I couldn't really taste much of the truffle flavor. For dessert I tried the creme brulee and chocolate truffles and both were pretty amazing. If you are a sweets person, the dessert might have been the best part of the meal!! Service was a tad on the slow side. Having not lived in NYC or traveled here in about 10 years, I'm not sure if that's the norm for this part of town or not (being it's so touristy and all?). I am generally not all that concerned as I usually don't have any place to be, but it did irk my dinner companions just a teensy bit.

Patio chair legs that cannot be slid between the patio table legs - so you cannot get your seat close enough to the table. 2. The tables wobble, though I know this happens a lot with outdoor furniture. 3. Strange primary server staring after she says ""hello"" then does not continue the conversation with ""would you like a drink"" or anything else.  Just walked away ....  4. Giving the diners next to you, who arrived 15 minutes after you, bread first.  5. Having to flag down the bread server to ask if we could have some bread, too.  6. Being given ONE bread plate from a setting at another table, then served 4 separate pieces of bread on it.  7. A minute or two later, separately being served a dish of oil.  8. Having to ask for a second bread plate for dining companion. 9. Being informed a little while after ordering a salad that they are out of this salad.  Upon asking whether all other salads are available, told ""No."" 10. Never being offered an opportunity for thirsty people to order a second glass of wine at a WINE BAR.  We would have ordered more! Oops, that was 10.  I have more, but as stated, this was just the Top Ten.  I could also comment, not really a complaint but more of a preference, that there was not enough variety on the menu, especially vegetarian or seafood options.  Nonetheless, with items 1-10 above, we had enough reasons never to return that this won't matter.  Continuing the lack of continuity at Morrell, we heard folks at next table talking about having had the ""special""...which was never offered until asked by the server who eventually wandered by to take our order.  Shortly after that, we overheard that the folks at next table had made a special order, and the person delivering to table had the wrong details on what the special order was.  After opening up the sandwiches and investigating, the customter determined that the order was indeed incorrect.  The server dude said, ""sorry, I forgot""....  Really?!?",0,1,0,Brooke M.,"Watertown, MA",4,9,0

Perfect for a lazy lunch. The tables are beautifully spaced for conversation and the patio is a stunner.  The wine list is one of the best in the city, providing true value and variety across the various wine regions, and especially French and Italian whites and reds.  I ate from the fixed price menu.  The potato leek soup was lite, not heavy, with a perfect nuance between the simple ingredients.  The pasta with seasonal wild mushrooms was a revelation in the simple meaty charms of the forest floor.

A cheese plate is a cheese plate we order them and always like them.  We also indulged in two desserts and a dessert wine.

3.0,5/5/2011,"I wandered in here early on a Wednesday evening for a glass of wine while waiting to meet a friend for dinner. From a large wine list, including many by the glass starting at $9, I picked the Honig Sauvignon Blanc (light and crisp). Despite the busy Rockefeller Center location and the touristy atmosphere created by the snazzy wooden bar, cheap French posters, and schizophrenic music (alternating American folk, techno jazz, and hip hop), the mostly after-work crowd gave the place a collegial and respectful vibe. Folks clumped in hushed pairs or thoughtful solos just enjoying their wine. The bartenders were helpful and courteous, occasionally prompting guests for seconds or thirds. There are small tables in the back and a 2nd floor where other patrons had bar food in addition to wine.",0,0,0,Marlon A.,"Manhattan, NY",113,239,337
1.0,4/13/2011,"I went to Morrell last night with a friend. We had both been there numerous times and loved it. After last night, we won't be going back. Morrell has a new chef, and the food has taken a decided nosedive, and the service left a lot to be desired.By the time we were approached for our drink request, we had already made our menu selections. We both ordered the beet salad to start (me with the goat cheese on the side, so my friend could have my portion), my friend ordered the risotto with duck confit, and I ordered the Udon noodles. We both ordered a glass of the gruner veltliner (Austrian wine).When our wine came, we noticed that it was very sweet -- far too sweet for a gruner veltliner, and neither of us drink sweet wines. So we asked, and were told that it was actually a blend of gruner and gewurtztraminer. However, the waiter told us that if we didn't like it, we could send it back and get something else -- but when he took our glasses, he didn't ask us what else we might want. And when our own waiter returned a few minutes later with two glasses of wine, he told us that the bartender had actually poured us the wrong wine and he was bringing us the wine we had ordered. (This new wine tasted like a gruner.) Then our ""beet salads"" arrived. Now, when I think of beet salad, I think of diced or julienned beets with a dressing of some kind and some herbs tossed in. This dish, however, consisted of perhaps a dozen pieced of diced red beet covered in a huge mound of greens. Okay, not what we expected, but not a problem -- until we took a bite. The greens were dressed in so much salt that they were almost inedible. Being hungry, we ate the salads anyway (and cut the salt as best we could with bread). When our dishes were removed, we asked that the chef be warned that the salads were extremely salty, thinking that perhaps s/he didn't know.When our main dishes arrived, we were beyond disappointed. We had both had the risotto before, and loved it. This risotto was slightly undercooked, the duck was slightly overcooked, and the sauce was flat -- all we could taste was black pepper. My dish was even worse; the sauce was salty, which made the noodles a bit salty, but that was fine. Nothing terrible. Then I took a bit of mussel; extremely salty. Then I took a bit of prawn, and it was so salty that I truly couldn't eat it.I have never, in my entire life, sent food back to the kitchen. And I have never, in my entire life, complained about overly-salted food. I like salt. Since I have low blood pressure, I get to eat as much salt as I want. But this dish was truly inedible.The waiter took the dish away, and returned a few minutes later asking whether I preferred to have the risotto instead, or the mushroom pappardelle. I had had the pappardelle before, and it was a safe choice, so I went with that. In the meantime, he told us that they were removing the salads from our check (a surprise, as we had both eaten our salads) and our waiter offered us each another glass of wine, gratis. We were pleasantly surprised by this gesture.Then my pappardelle arrived. I was informed that it had been made without salt -- and it tasted like it! (Was the chef trying to make a statement? Not a way to win repeat business.) Since there was no salt shaker on our table, and our waiter had disappeared, I had to reach across to an empty table nearby for the salt shaker and I applied a liberal amount to the dish. With salt, the dish wan't bad; but it wasn't good, either. The pasta and mushrooms were perfectly cooked, but the only seasoning appeared to be a small amount of onion, and there was way too much oil used.Also of note, our waiter never came back to ask how my meal was, to ask if we wanted more wine, or to offer us a dessert menu. He simply disappeared. For about an hour. We were having a lovely conversation, enjoying each other's company, so this wasn't a problem -- it was just odd. Like we'd been so troublesome that all he wanted to do was ignore us for the rest of the evening.All in all, the food was so terrible and the service so abrupt that neither of us will likely frequent this restaurant in the future.",1,1,0,Rebecca K.,"Denver, CO",0,11,0

3.0,11/4/2010,"I'll tell you a little secret...I hate wine bars.I love wine. I love wine more than Christopher Walken likes hot dogs. But I hate being gouged for it more than Jon Stewart hates Glenn Beck. When I get invited to a wine bar, I expect to pay for the privilege. It's restaurant insider knowledge that the cost of a glass on the menu will inevitably be priced equal to, if not more than, the wholesale cost of the bottle. After all, they have to recover the cost of the bottle if they have to open it. That's why I paper bag my bottle from the wino store, and take my shit home.Morrell Wine Bar & Cafe has probably the deepest selection of whites, reds, sparkling, and sweet wines by the glass. It also is in Rockefeller Center, one of the most easily accessible locations in Manhattan.With selection and convenience, however, comes steep prices. Strangely enough, the greatest deal in the store was a 2005 Cos D' Estournel (Saint Estephe) for the Bordeaux bargain price of $52/glass; at about 4-5 glasses per bottle, the markup was slightly above the $210 retail price for this bottle.The worst deal in the store: almost every wine by the glass. It took me about five minutes to find a glass of wine -- a 2009 Acheval Ferrer Malbec -- that wasn't priced more than the bottle. Ordinarily, I'd pass on drinking such a full-bodied, tannic, fruit-bomb of a wine without a steak, but you got to find value somewhere.For future note: please don't invite me to a wine bar unless it's the back-of-store loading area of Astor Wine & Spirits and you have a nice bottle of 2005 Cos D'Estournel in a paper bag.",4,1,5,Jonas M.,"Brooklyn, NY",6,166,0

The wine list is extensive, and all of us were quite pleased with our choices.  And prices were not bad at all, especially for the quality of food you're gettng.  Most things around low - mid twenties for the entrees, with some less expensive and a few more.  I'm intrigued enough to want to try more of the entrees, but the long wait time and the small portions would probably keep me from recommending this place to all of my friends.",0,0,0,Jon L.,"New York, NY",166,449,0

3.0,7/18/2008,"Good lunch spot - reliable service and food and not a crazy tab.  I plan on going back when I'm less hung over to sample the cheese plate and try the wine!!  This time around I had the hanger steak salad, which had nice flavors and the steak was great.  My friend had the black pepper farfalle w/ sausage and it was also delicious.",1,0,0,Arielle W.,"New York, NY",24,212,0
3.0,12/12/2007,"This was one of the places we had dinner at while visiting NYC.  My first piece of advice is to not come here for dinner 3 weeks before Christmas.  We had to abort our cab a block from the restaurant and it still took another 30 mins to walk there through Rockefeller and Saks crowds.  We had reservations and were seated at a nice table in the loft area.  The bar area was definitely crowded and noisy, but that's expected. The wine list is very extensive and we were hoping our waitress could make a nice selection, but there was a lot she had not tried before. We finally made a selection and ordered the cheese plate to go with it. It turned out that the bottle we ordered was no longer available, so we ordered another.  Unfortunately, our cheese plate was delivered first and we were forced to stare at our empty wine glasses for at least half an hour before our waitress returned with our wine.  She was definitely trying to be quick, but she clearly had too many tables and the stairs were slowing her down as well. She also didn't prioritize very well because serving our wine is way more important than getting another table their check.So the cheese plate was good and had nice variety. Our wine selection was what we wanted and actually came as a recommendation from our waitress. For dinner, we had the black pepper fettuccine and shrimp risotto. Both were satisfying, yet we preferred the fettuccine. I think this place is nice and we just experienced some sub par service.  Food is good, but not that good.  Go for the wine.",1,0,1,michelle l.,"Atlanta, GA",6,4,0
3.0,8/14/2007,"For what it is it might deserve higher marks but it's hard to say.  From the jump: the white bread is pointless, the whole grain bread is very good.  Everyone around us had the cheese plate but we didn't have time, though it looked nice.  My date had the lamb burger sliders which had in my opinion a decent crunch, but were either overpowered by the dressing-like sauce on them, or underwhelmed by the lack of lamb/burger taste as a whole, and the bread while crunch did not stand up flavor-wise either. I didn't try his lobster salad but it looked decent if you want something extremely light (bits of lobster meat and sprouts).  I had the sweet pea/shrimp risotto which was slightly off-putting as, on the menu it says it comes with a tomato confit, but once it arrived it was green. . . Also, I typically stray from anything excessively creamy and oily - and let's just say this was extremely creamy and surrounded by oil.. but once the amazing flavors hit my mouth, all was forgiven.  Decadent, yes. Filling? As time progresses!  And certainly not something you would want to eat every day (not for the health conscious!) but a very lovely dish indeed.My date had a chardonnay that, for $30/glass, came far too cold and wasn't suitable until the end of our meal. By then it had a wonderful flavor, but that was far too late in the game. My Spanish red was described as complex and powerful, but was truly unimpressive as far as Spanish wine is concerned.And while it may sound like I am complaining (our waiter was awful), I still enjoyed the place and would go back. Why?  My dinner was excellent, the outdoor seating is fun (and I wasn't even facing Rock Center, And I am not a fan typically of  outdoor dining).  I honestly shouldn't have enjoyed it - the tables are close together, but somehow, it was a lovely place to sit, and my meal leads me to believe other things on the menu are winners. Just... not the sliders.",1,0,0,Valerie J.,"Sheboygan, WI",152,296,3312
4.0,6/19/2007,"Do you have specialized companions?  Some who you shop with?  Others you grab a quick lunch with?  And some others you share your dinner table with?  And those you strictly watch movies with?  Of which, you indulge in drama with some, humor with others?  Well, I do not have specialized companions.  But I have always gone to Morrell's for lunch with this one client of mine.  Wonder why -- search me -- it just happens.If you come here, try and get an outside table--that makes quite a difference.  The Morrell Cheese selection serves as a great appetizer--you could pair it with a red from their excellent collection of wines, or simply sip sparkling water, as your eyes partake of all the activity in the Rockefeller Plaza area.  Alternatively, or additionally, go with the mixed greens--notably yummy, with pears and pomegranate.  Of the entrees, I tend to pick one of two choices--the butternut squash ravioli, or the roasted vegetable plate.  Both satisfy one's craving for a light yet delicious lunch-time treat.At the end of the day though, it is all about the wine and cheese.  And the ambience.  And that one client I keep returning to Morrell's with.",9,6,9,Srini V.,"Manhattan, NY",467,463,97
5.0,6/19/2007,"This place was great.  I went here for lunch last Saturday with my parents.  Unfortunately we went right at lunch rush on a very nice day so there were no outside tables available without a long wait, but they got us inside immediately.The wine selection here is massive.  Pretty much anything you want at any price level.  I'd highly recommend this place if you are really looking for something a little different that you can't normally find.I was also surprised by how good my lunch was.  I didn't really expect  a wine bar to have such good food.  I had the gnocchi, and I could have eaten another entire bowl.  Very very good.I'd highly recommend this place and plan on going back.",3,0,1,Brent M.,"Stow, MA",2,71,3
5.0,5/26/2007,"What a great store. I love my wine. I love my wine affordable. Though most of the stuff here is out of my price range, I know that in a few years, I'll be able to afford many of the options this store provides. The salesmen are all pretty boys, which is always nice, and there's a wine bar adjacent to the store. I look forward to the days when I won't have to look at the price tags and have to do a double-take. Thankfully, they have a pretty good collection of affordable wines too, which are excellent!",6,5,5,Arnab M.,"Los Angeles, CA",275,618,238
5.0,7/12/2006,"At any given moment in the city people are drinking.   Of these people, many of them are drinking wine.  Most of these people are not drinking at Morrell Wine Bar and Cafe.  And that's a shame.   The wine list is not a written on some chalk board or on a piece of paper.  It is contained in a metal bound tome with over one hundred wines by the glass and even more by the bottle.  The list is sorted by country, then type.  The breadth of their cellar is incredible.   Not only do they have many selections from popular regions, such as Bordeaux or Napa, they have more esoteric wines.  Once, there was an Italian wine whose grapes came from a vineyard near a volcano.  Each wine has a helpful description that you'll find was written by someone familiar with wine.   The selection changes regularly, as well.The staff is very helpful.  The only downside to the place is that it is very crowded, especially before 8 PM.The Wine Bar is adjacent to the Morrell Wine store, one of the top wine stores in the country.  From what I'm told they are related, but not directly associated.",4,1,2,Andrew S.,"New York, NY",4,8,0
4.0,3/26/2006,"You're not coming here to eat, you're coming here to drink--wine, and lots of it. They have a fantastic by-the-glass list (between forty and sixty different wines), ranging from rustic country wines from Languedoc to top-notch California cabs (how many places have Opus One by the glass?). Don't forget: all the glassware is Riedel crystal, the view of Rock Center is fabulous and there's outdoor seating. Final note: if you get there before 9 PM, make sure you go next door to the Morrell Wine Store--maybe a little pricey, but the fantastic selection makes up for it.",3,0,0,Christopher H.,"New York, NY",58,43,0
