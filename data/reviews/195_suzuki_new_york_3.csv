4.0,3/2/2019,"Ambiance is nice and quiet, and the service was friendly. However, it's underground location and lack of window starts to feel a bit depressing after a while. The food was lackluster - none of them tasted bad, but none tasted Stella's either. I had one of the lunch sets - it was a lot of food. The tempura tastes interesting, like it's wrapped in crispy rice. The fish, both cooked and sashimi, was ok, nothing memorable. The green tea tofu is the highlight, if I have to pick one. It's a good place to go to for those corporate lunches, since it's an easy environment for conversations, but I won't go again otherwise.",0,0,0,Tina S.,"New York, NY",1,49,46
4.0,2/26/2019,I came here for restaurant and it's a cute place. I would say not casual but not black tie either. I noticed many business people with suitcases so I assume many people come here for meetings or before flights. The service is great and the staff is attentive. They have a coat check which was helpful in the winter with puffy coats!I ordered the hamburger and because it was restaurant the portions were definitely smaller. The food was still good but for appetizers they had this uni mousse and I did not like the texture of it at all. The fish is fresh though. My friend and I also ordered nigiri. The toro and salmon were melt in your mouth and had a good rice to fish proportion. Not sure if I'd be back but it was definitely worth the try!,0,0,0,Jasmine C.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",9,60,29
2.0,2/21/2019,"We figured we venture out from our favorite Japanese eateries and try something newish and notable in New York. We should've consulted Yelp over local NYC lists. We had reservations in the main dining room and opted for the Kaiseki, multi course menu.  We were underwhelmed by our experience at Suzuki. Especially for the $1000 price tag for four people. While the service was timely, there were too many errors to justify the price point. From servers not knowing the dishes to overcooked crab and a Sake list that clearly had not been updated. The first three bottles we tried to order were out of stock. The food was presented nicely, but any dinner at this price point should be close to flawless.",3,0,1,Isabella J.,"Tucson, AZ",1537,1004,4826

2.0,2/16/2019,"4.5 for food 1 for kitchen service3.5 for table serviceI came here a second time tonight and ordered from the a la carte menu. Ordered the sashimi, yellowtail roll, tuna roll, seasonal tempura, miso cod and the ginsa sushi. The sashimi and rolls were solid, fresh and tasty. The ginsa sushi we got did not come with any gold flakes as it had described on the menu. For $23 for three pieces I definitely wanted my gold flakes. I told the waiter my dish was missing gold flakes and he was kind enough to make it up with a few pieces of comped sushi. This was when things went downhill really quick. We then waited another 45 min and tried to check on our remaining dishes many times throughout. We kept on being told it would come out soon. Given we had a show to catch we were quite agitated and also hungry. They comped us with a crab appetizer which was OK and then kept telling us it would take another twenty minutes for the food to come out. At this point they comped us with some duck rolls which were tasty but I just wanted the original items I ordered. After over an hour of waiting we decided to leave and didn't end up getting to try the remaining two dishes we had ordered. The waiter was apologetic but I could see other tables had the same issue and were waiting for their dishes and even had to cancel a few. Not sure what was going on with the kitchen service tonight but was deeply disappointed. It was nice they comped us on a few items but this is not the type of service I expect for a well run Japanese restaurant. I enjoyed the food we got to try but would hesitate coming back because of how horribly slow the kitchen service was.",0,0,0,Joyce L.,"Brooklyn, NY",25,287,470
5.0,2/16/2019,"They have a very beautiful interior especially the long dining table. We came to try the Valentine's day 8 course Modern Kaiseki meal. It was also our first Kaiseki experience. Every dish was delicious and really brought out your umami. The portion wasn't too little or too much. It was just right since our stomachs were pretty satisfied by the end of the meal. Presentation of the food were beautiful as well. Best thing about the menu is that it includes sushi from Satsuki, which what they got their Michelin Star for. Suzuki is the dine in portion of the restaurant, whereas Satsuki is the Omakase bar experience.  Other than the special Vday menu, you also have the option to choose the traditional Kaiseki menu. Our favorites were the baked foie gras on mash potato, Grilled cod fish, Sashimi, lobster sushi, and cute heart shaped dessert with gold flakes on top!",2,0,1,Monica W.,"Queens, NY",108,321,1356
3.0,2/14/2019,"We were a bit disappointed in our dinner experience this past week. The food was tasty but not very cohesive and the entire experience was not worth the $180 per person price tag (as other Yelpers have noted).I made reservations for two to enjoy a kaiseki meal (multi course with seasonal ingredients) at Suzuki's Rose Room, which was listed on their website as serving kaiseki exclusively. With that in mind we thought we were in for a feast for the eyes and the stomach. When we got to the restaurant we were shown a table at the main dining room because the Rose Room was still not ready for guests. We were confused about this change but were assured that the kaiseki will still be served. It took a few minutes before we were shown drink menus, but not a dinner menu. Then our first course arrived and finished before our drinks were brought to our table. Our dinner proceeds with an explanation for each course as it was brought out. In general each course was well prepared and tasty. However, since we have had other kaiseki experiences, the dinner at Suzuki ranks low on our list.   We were not amazed or delighted in how the dishes were presented, nor was there an obvious transition or coherence from dish to dish. I would recommend sticking to the a la carte menu.",0,0,0,Anna L.,"KNICKERBOCKER, NY",96,68,70
5.0,2/12/2019,"It's a quiet place near Times Square crowd. I went during the restaurant week menu with four courses. The appetizer includes uni, snow crab, seaweed salad and ikuro.

1.0,2/7/2019,Very disappointed by their restaurant menu. No nightlights for me. Sashimi over rice is plain and not so fresh. Appetizer is below average.

1.0,2/1/2019,Suzuki's restaurant week options are such a disappointment. Ordered the steam duck as my main course and the duck tastes stinky and gamey. The portion is absolutely tiny! There are only 3 pieces of duck for your main course. The rice and appetizers are ok. There are so many good Japanese restaurants in NYC and Suzuki is definitely not one of them.,0,0,0,Chloe M.,"Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",1,60,47

5.0,1/29/2019,"PSA: They have a restaurant week menu and their bar, III Pillars has an $8 happy hour menu that runs all day!! My friends and I came here last Thursday and were pleasantly surprised by the restaurant week menu offering. We all decided to do it and we all loved each course. Their $42 restaurant week menu was fantastic. For the zensai appetizers you get served each one (see my photo). Love their traditional Japanese small plates, great presentation. The snow crab and uni were highlights for me. I had the steamed duck for the main course. It was cooked perfectly. Then I had the waygu for Shokuji course, again fantastically done. Brown sugar ice cream was a great ending, really not too sweet given it's brown sugar flavored. For $42 this was a steal. I've been so disappointed by many other restaurant week menus but this one exceeds all expectations. Menu:Zensai appetizers (you get all of these): snow crab, sashimi yuba with ikura, uni mousse, spinach ohitashi, and seaweed saladMain: Steamed duck with saka-mushi (other choice was grilled Spanish mackarel)Shokuji: Waygu steak takikomi rice bowl (other option was chirashu sushi bowl)Mizumono: brown sugar ice cream",3,0,0,Pheabe C.,"San Francisco, CA",33,90,228
3.0,1/29/2019,"Came here for restaurant week dinner and I must say, I've definitely had better. Everyone has the same appetizer dishes:- Crab Sunomono: nothing special- Sashimi Yuba with Ikura: second best, the ponzu was a nice touch- Uni Mousse: the best one, I liked the cream mousse paired with uni- Spinach Ohitashi: just spinach- Seaweed Salad: averageYou get to choose between the steamed duck or the grilled spanish mackarel. We chose the steamed duck and it was really just four pieces. The next choice is between the sushi bowl and the steak takikomi rice. We chose the takikomi rice and this was the only dish I enjoyed. I really liked the wagyu steak. The dessert was house made brown sugar ice cream. A very very small scoop. They don't give you the typical restaurant week experience. Technically you only get to choose two dishes and they don't give you much of a dessert. I've definitely had better Japanese food.I do like the vibe of this place. They have dim lighting and piano music playing in the background. However when it gets busy - it gets noisy. I preferred it when there only a few tables around. It was much more quiet.",0,0,0,Sherry J.,"Manhattan, NY",182,191,832
2.0,1/28/2019,very basic food with small portion and just ok taste. Not even meet a fusion standard. Very disappointed  for the food and the service. I ordered the sake pairing but the waiter totally forgot about me. He never served us the third pairing which is supposed to go with the main course.

4.0,1/25/2019,"Full-time life means I can no longer go jet-setting whenever I please, which is tragic. On the upside, I have more disposable income for food and things like Restaurant Week. I can live with this.I kicked Restaurant Week off with Suzuki and their rather unorthodox menu. For the appetizer, you get a preset assortment of small dishes. The main course offers up two meat options (duck or mackerel), followed by two shokuji options (chirashi bowl or wagyu and mushroom bowl with miso soup). Dessert is their house-made brown sugar ice cream. It's fairly different from the usual RW appetizer, entree, and dessert menu that gives you more options and freedom to choose. That's not necessarily a bad thing though, because they clearly know what they're doing here.Each appetizer bite was perfectly balanced and tasty. I really enjoyed the seaweed salad, which had just a hint of spice and a great umami flavor from the garlic-sesame vinaigrette. The tofu skin with ikura was pretty tasty too, though I've realized I can do without ikura. Second place went to the crab sunomono. The natural sweetness of the crab really shone through and melded well with the flavors of the seaweed and dashi vinegar. The uni mousse was a runaway favorite. I adore uni but I wasn't sure what to expect... some fluffy but possibly unappetizing blend of uni and cream, perhaps? Nope. We got Santa Barbara uni on top of a gelatinous soy milk pudding of sorts. The sweet, buttery uni complemented the velvety, creamy texture of the soy milk so, so well. This was honestly the best bite of the night for me.For my main course, I chose the grilled Spanish mackerel simmered in soy dashi. I'm not usually a mackerel fan, but this was perfectly cooked and not super fishy like I'm used to. The soy dashi added the perfect salty, umami notes without being overpowering, and it was elegantly simple but effective. My friend's steamed duck had a great garlic ginger sauce, but the duck itself was slightly chewier than I'd like.I got the wagyu and mushroom bowl for my shokuji course, but was in full regret mode as soon as I made the order (especially when I saw other diners' chirashi bowls). This was my least favorite dish of the night. I did get quite a few wagyu slices, and they were pretty tender with a great beefy flavor, but at the end of the day it's just beef to me. The mountain of slightly sticky sushi rice threw the ratio off and made me wish for more sauce, since the rice itself wasn't that flavorful.The house-made brown sugar ice cream was actually quite good. We got a kid's meal portion of a scoop, but it had a bit of nuttiness and a really milky, creamy flavor while still being very light and refreshing. Good palate cleanser to finish the meal, but more would have been nice.Aside from the shokuji options, most of the dishes seemed almost laughably small, but I was pretty satisfied with the flavors and overall quality.",6,2,4,Wendy W.,"Brooklyn, NY",135,190,778
5.0,1/21/2019,"Came here for restaurant week dinner for celebration and I have to say, the options were FABULOUS. The staff, ambience and basically entire meal felt like a top notch $$$$ experience. It's probably my favorite restaurant week deal so far in the 5 years I've been going for restaurant week. You get to try a ton of terrific dishes (5 mini appetizers + 1 main dish + 1 rice dish + dessert) for an unbelievable price.

2.0,1/21/2019,"I just had one of the saddest dining experiences of my life at Suzuki on a recent Saturday evening.  I had an 8:15pm reservation, and there was only one other table in the entire restaurant.  It was both eerie and creepy, especially on a Saturday evening in midtown Manhattan.By 8:45pm, the one other table had finished their meal, and my guest an I were alone.  It made for an EXTREMELY depressing dining experience.My guest and I both did the Omakase, which for the price was just meh.  I have definitely had much, much better sushi.  In addition, the service was marginal.So, I really do not have much good to say about this sad excuse for a restaurant.YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!!!!",1,0,0,Tim S.,"New York, NY",3,100,0
5.0,1/17/2019,"It was amazing!  I think this was one the best Omakase as far as variety and quality.  The starter was amazing because it had three different flavor bites that each were unique and delicious.  There was a fried fish dish that was perfect.  Then there was a sashimi plate that was incredible.  There was a soup dish that you lightly cook fish in and then drank the broth.  There was a dessert that was somehow perfect for the meal that we just ate.  It was sweet and light and refreshing to have.  These were all complimentary of the sushi portion of the meal.  Believe me, I was kind of worried that this Omakase was not really going to have that much sushi.  Once we were on the sushi, we got all kinds and it was beautiful and most importantly tasty.  I felt like we got a lot of varieties and techniques from our chef.Lastly, was the chef himself and the area we at.  He was so friendly.  You get as much as you give when doing these dinners.  I have had friendly chefs and not so friendly chefs and he was very friendly.  He was engaging and answered our questions, made jokes, and was just an incredible chef and host.  Some people kept quiet and ate, but we like to engage with our chef in such a small space.  I highly recommend everything about this place.",2,0,3,Aaron W.,"Hoboken, NJ",102,83,46
4.0,1/11/2019,"First off, Aesthetically Suzuki is stunning. It has a 5-star feel from the moment you enter. The owners must have spent a fortune on the interior. The food is not bad either. I started with the duck tataki, and eggplant appetizers. Flawless presentation, but very tiny portions, and I wasn't wowed by the flavours. Not that they were bad, just not great. The main course was an assortment of sushi; Chu Toro, Arctic Char, Soy marinated tuna, Salmon, Kinmedai, Uni and Kampachi. The toro and uni were the standouts, and delicious. The only piece I didn't love was the kinmedai, but otherwise everything was delicious. Perfect service, solid food, and amazing ambiance. There is also a really nice bar in a separate area where they serve everything on the menu. Too bad it's stuck in a relatively obscure location near times square. Hopefully, word of mouth starts to spread, and they do well. Solid 4-stars",1,0,0,Mario F.,"Manhattan, NY",55,64,0

Overall, the fish options were good, but I wish there were more selections of different types of fish. The portion size is a bit smaller than what I'm used to than at other lunch chirashi places as well. Overall, it was a good one time eat, but would probably check out other lunch chirashi places next time I was visiting NYC.",1,1,2,Jackie C.,"Washington, DC",287,187,610
1.0,12/24/2018,"Terrible value for money.  When I spend $180 on a Kaiseki menu, I expect strong execution and concept - none of which was present here.  Even the tea was bad, it had no flavor and came lukewarm.  I asked the server to bring hot tea and he replaced it with a slightly warmer liquid that still tasted like water with a hint of tea.  The dishes were served with decent presentation, but the temperature and flavor was never right.  For the soy cod hotpot dish, we were told that the fish was cold and we only needed to heat it in the hotpot for 20 seconds.  I followed instructions and bit into a semi frozen piece of fish because the hot pot liquid did not come out hot and the fish was not cooked through.  The sushi was average, certainly not $180 value.   I dine quite often at high end Omakase and Kaiseki restaurants in NYC and this was by far the worst.",0,0,0,Justin C.,"New York, NY",0,1,0

He even accommodated my wish of no wasabi, since I do not like wasabi on anything. The only thing I didn't like was the sea cucumber ( i have touched those in the ocean and they feel in your hands very similar to how it feels in your mouth- not a pleasant texture- but as Bourdain says it's the last frontier for the western palate)  The  cocktails were also delicious.

3.0,12/14/2018,"Did the $230 option here.  I have been to most of the omakase places in NYC and this falls squarely middle of the pack.  Priced adjusted, probably closer to the bottom.  If you want traditional edo style, Yasuda is the way to go.  If you want something less traditional, Masa is (though also not great value) and Ishikawa (pretty good value) are excellent.  Went to Zo Hanare last week and that was much better all around.  I was honestly pretty disappointed with this place.  The caveat is I was at a large table so they did not seat us at the sushi bar -- maybe that would have made a difference?  I doubt Chef Suzuki even prepared the pieces.  There weren't many interesting fish (had yellowtail in 4 courses), and even the tried and true (maguro, otoro, uni) was just so so as far as freshness/ quality.",0,0,0,Kevin G.,"Manhattan, NY",83,36,4

I had previously dined at an Omakase restaurant that has earned their first Michelin Star as well but needless to say Satsuki truly was an experience. Chef Toshio is an experienced artisan who takes pride in his craft. He not only made sure to meet the needs and expectations of this patrons but also took time to converse with us, not only informing us what it was he was serving but general conversation also about various topics regarding how the fish were gathered, about his coming to New York, and about his upbringing in Japan, making the experience more intimate and friendly (something I had not experienced at my first omakase restaurant). The sushi was absolutely wonderful and fresh, so much I had ordered a few more pieces afterwards. The presentation was artistic as well.

Service was timely, however the serving staff didn't seem to have adequate knowledge of the menu. There were a few instances here I wanted to know what I was eating and they didn't know. What really downgraded my review, however, is that I had to ask for 3 different bottles of sake until they had one that I wanted in stock.

4.0,12/1/2018,"The decor and the ambience give a formal and inviting impression on the guests, with spacious seating. The service was good, and they do their best to accommodate each customer's order to match up meal times of all members of a party.I ordered the Suzuki sushi omakase, which consisted of ten nigiri (sushi) and one maki (roll). The chef presents the omakase course in two plates. The night I went, the first plate included, in recommended order, hamachi (yellow tail), ika (squid), kenmadai (golden eye snapper), hotate (scallop), and tsukuri (belt fish). The second plate consisted of anago (sea eel), engawa (fin), kurodai (black trout), chutoro (medium fatty tuna), sake (king salmon), and otoro maki (fatty tuna roll).The seafood was all fresh or slightly seared, with a decent variety. A proper nigiri restaurant always has fresh wasabi, and this was the case for Suzuki. The portions of rice for each piece were appropriate, but slightly over cooked and with a tad too much vinegar. It would also have better if there were a nigiri/sashimi a la carte menu to order from.Suzuki may not be the best nigiri restaurant in NYC, but I would recommend to anyone looking for a more quiet at atmosphere with a good selection.P.S.

The quality of the ingredients is fantastic but literally every piece of sushi tasted unbelievable with tremendous thought and careful effort. Tips- 2 seatings with staggered times.

I wanted to have some of my sushi torched. It wasn't a problem at other Michelin sushi restaurants I have been to. They didn't think it was right to do that, and it was fine not to. However, I was very unhappy with they way they forced me to think sushi needed to be ate their way. They first asked me if I have ever had expensive sushi before? That is just offensive! Two the sushi chef said I don't do sushi torched, that's not sushi! They shouldn't put their mind into mine and they shouldn't talk to their customer like they are idiots to think sushi can be torched. Also, they mentioned that they don't torch and we don't get to choose bc it's omokase. I understand omokase is chef's choice of what's good that day, but customer have right to say what we don't want or allergic to or express our preference right? At that point, I just don't want to eat anymore.

3.0,6/10/2018,"Not a super pleasant Omakase experience. We did the $250 option as we thought 10 pieces of sushi would be little and wanted to try the ultimate experience. But it turned out the dishes other than the 10 pieces of sushi were quite disappointing. The fish used for the appetizers were not even totally defrosted - most disappointing, as in my opinion fish was to be tasted its freshness best at room temp. It was a great amount in terms of quantity (very filling). But only 3 or 4 pieces of sushi were memorably good. Other ones were either too salty or tons of wasabi. Def thumb up Chef's skill when preparing the sushi and the high quality of the sushi rice - but sauces matter too. Dessert needs improvement - the jelly was very dry. Also not sure if we are too young that the chef doesn't want to talk to us or what. During the whole experience we felt being ignored. Waiters were caring. The chef didn't even check in with us one time if it tasted good or something similarly. It was my first time seeing such an ignorant sushi chef doing omasake. We left straight out of the sushi bar once we signed our check. 3 stars only to the quality of fish and good service by waiters and the restaurant's neat decor.

4.0,5/7/2018,"Satsuki has been on my list for awhile now and I finally made it here. I was staying in Time Square this time, so it made perfect sense that I would make a reservation here. I was able to get in the same day on a Wednesday day. It was actually not busy at all. The door is hard to find - I walked past it a couple times and didn't notice the door. There were no signs or anything. You check in on the ground level, then you can proceed to the lower level where Suzuki and Satsuki are. Once you were seated at the sushi bar, they present you two boxes of fish (one is specifically just different cuts of tuna, the order is the rest of the fish that you will get to enjoy during your omakase course).The chef was very nice and watching him work is definitely very fascinating. I love watching a master works; so much concentration and focus. It's the attitude and respect for food that I appreciate.The fish was indeed very fresh. However, I took one star off because I felt like the combination did not really bring out the best of the fish I had. Like, there is not really a lot of ""wow"" factors, which I think that's what omakase is all about. For the price-point, it is worth every single penny. For $130, you get 10 nigiri, 1 handroll, a miso soup, and also the endless entertainment of watching a master at work, it's a steal. I was actually really happy with my sushi that I contemplated in coming back the next day, but I opted for Suzuki for a change instead - watch my next review. I will definitely come back to Satsuki.

Although Suzuki served all the requisite kaiseki courses, it was painfully pedestrian, with muddled flavours and uninspired presentation.  Insult on top of injury, it was among the most expensive kaiseki meals we have had in Manhattan.   Truly a waste of 2.5 hours and $500.",0,0,0,Joanna C.,"Philadelphia, PA",0,13,0
3.0,4/17/2018,"Cuisine: 4Service: 8Decor: 7Value: 3Overall: 6There was real excitement when I had heard of this new kaiseke restaurant. I had just returned from Japan and memories of high quality kaiseke meals fueled that burning flame. With glowing previews in mind, three of us visited the restaurant during its first few weeks of operations.Unfortuantely, while the decor was decent but feels cold, and the server being relatively knowledgeable, the cuisine itself really suffered. Believe me, the outstanding visual presentation that other reviewers have mentioned is all accurate, yet I must judge the quality of the food on its own merits. Here is a full accounting of our Uzuki chef's tasting menu ($150) on May 5th, 2017.The meal begins with a small complimentary glass of peach champagne. Nice start.1. Zensai (Sesame Tofu, Scallop, Pumpkin Castilla) - 4/10. The extraordinary presentation was a 10, but the individual items were all forgettable. The Sesame Tofu was way too sweet, while the Scallop was okay, the Pumpkin Castilla just felt underwhelming. I gave it a point higher due to the beautiful plating.2. Wanmori (Traditional Clear Soup) - 3/10. Broth itself was clean but lacked flavor. The worst part was the pink gooey mochi-like dumpling inside the soup. It felt disgusting as I chewed the weird substance. Keep in mind that I'm Chinese and like practically all textures. Apparently not this one. And my two fellow diners liked it even less. Switch to a simple miso soup please. Lol3. Tsukuri (Assorted Seasonal Sashimi) - 8/10. Consisting of Akami (Lean Bluefin Tuna), Otoro (Fatty Bluefin Tuna), Hirame (Fluke), Botan Ebi (Sweet Shrimp) and Hokkaido Uni (Sea Urchin). Nothing wow, but fresh and delicious. Highlight of our meal.4. Shinogi (Conger Eel Sushi) - 4/10. The anago was relatively tough and not to mention it sat on top of cool rice. On my most recent trip to Japan, I experienced an eel on rice that was so unbelievable that I could have easily rated this course lower.5. Shiizakana (Apple Gratin with Shrimp) - 2/10. Not sure what I am eating here. Cheese, apple, shrimp, they don't blend well in my mind, nor in my mouth. Can't taste the shrimp being overpowered by its counterparts. Definitely not Japanese, and the French would regard it as garbage as well. None of us took more than two or three small bites. 6. Yakimono (Miso Cod, Grilled Turban Shell, etc.) - 4/10.  Certainly not one of the better Miso Cod I have experienced. Main reason is that the flavor was too light and the extravagant plating likely contributed to the fish being barely lukewarm. Uni on the Grilled Turban Shell was sandy and dry, while tmeat inside was extremely chewy. Dry Persimmon and Baby Spinach were the best bites from this course, but nothing wow. As for the sweet pickled turnip, I rather eat the version that accompanies Korean fried chicken. Boiled mountain vegetables were flavorless. Once again, I gave an extra point for the wonderful presentation.7. Nimono (Miyazaki A5 Wagyu Sukiyaki) - 7/10. No denying the quality of the beef, which is why it's hard to screw up this course. Yes, the beef was tender and delicious. However, the sauce was too bland and barely impacted the taste of the dish. It would also be nice if they provided a bowl of rice and a raw egg for dipping. They said this was not a traditional sukiyaki and did not provide us with eggs even though we were willing to pay for it.8. Shokuji (Crab Infused Rice) - 3/10. This dish has two of my favorite ingredients, crab and ikura (salmon roe). Yet the only thing that kept going through my mind was how dry the rice was, as well as the crab meat. It felt as if the rice was overcooked and all the moisture was sucked out. Ikura (salmon eggs) helped a bit, but not enough. Go try the Lobster & Dungeness Crab Winter Bamboo Rice at Brushstroke for a comparison. Night and day.9. Tomewan (Red Miso Soup with Asari Clams) - 1/10. Extremely strong red miso flavor overpowered the few clams that were in the soup. More so, we kept spitting out sand from the clams. This shouldn't happen at a high end restaurant, especially Japanese where they are so meticulous about their seafood. Again, miso soup please.10. Mizumono (Strawberry Mousse w/ Seasonal Fruits) - 3/10. Sorry, but I had better mousse from a Las Vegas buffet. The jelly texture on the bottom is a confusing texture to pair with the mousse above. Also, we received strawberry and pineapple as our seasonal fruits. Come on! You can do better.To be completely honest, I am a food snob, no doubt. I am practically a diva when it comes to Japanese food. However, I am fair and will rate every restaurant truthfully based on my opinion. You can see what I wrote about Naoki and Mifune, similar new restaurants, for a comparison. With a chef clearly able to present cuisine in an artistic fashion, improvement on his techniques and flavoring can make a dramatic difference. I wish them luck!",3,0,1,Gordon Y.,"Rego Park, NY",562,237,1376
1.0,3/24/2018,"I am not going to judge on the food because this could be biased on the personal taste. I want to talk about my BAD EXPERIENCE at this place. I was having a dinner at this place. When I checked in, the front desk person helped me to checked my coat. On my way back home, I realized that my home key in my pocket was missing. I don't have any other bags, so my key must be lost at the cost check. I called them to ask about my key, and they said they found my key and I can pick it up at my convenience(it seems like I was the person lost my key there, and they were nicely helped me to keep it), which is NOT the case! They lost my key in the pocket while doing the coat check. I had to take a cab back to pick it up. On the other day, I realized that my key is not the only thing they lost from my pocket! They also lost my luxury brand compact(limited edition, and not sale in the states). I called again, and they were ""nicely"" saying that they helped me found it, and we could find a way to get it back to me(the only possible way is I go back to pick it up myself, no other options). I mentioned I might be able to pick it up shortly, but I might be busy and not be able to pick it up. They asked my name and said they would keep it, nothing else.I was trying to pick up twice. One time is Sunday they are weekly closing; another time they are also closed on weekday because of the storm(I live and work far from their location, so it won't be that easy to come to their place each time). Finally, on my third visit, they are open and I have the chance to talk to the staff, but they couldn't find my staff and said it might be cleared because they won't keep the lost and find staff for over 3 week to a month(it's my first time learning this from the staff. They never told me before when I called to ask about my staff). This time, they asked me about my name and number, and said they will get back to me after they checked the office(actually they NEVER call). After I kept calling them, the third time they are telling me that they are traffic sorry, my staff is cleared and would offer me 2 cocktails next time I visit. I didn't take the offer because I won't visit again because of this bad experience, and the value of my staff is way over 2 cocktails. They then asked me what else they would possibly offer. I ask about anything other then that, and then they said unfortunately that's the only they could offer at time moment. They always pretend to be nice, but they did nothing. As a fine dinning place, I was totally not satisfying their service. How could they lost the staff when helping the customers do the coat check. I'm sure I am not the only person, because when I first called, they asked me some other staff lost in coat room, which is not mine. Someone else must ""lose"" staff in their coat room. I called multiple times to ask my staff, but they just clear it without notifying me in any form. They made it like I carelessly lost my staff and they nicely helped me to keep it, and I didn't pick it up in time, so they could do nothing on it. BUT they didn't take care of the staff and lose customer's staff while doing coat check in the first place.Again, I present no opinion on their food, but I want to let others know my bad experience at this place.",1,0,0,Yizhou C.,"Brookline, MA",0,1,0

1.0,3/17/2018,"I am so confused as to how this place got 4.5 stars....it's $250 for an omakase. Now I've eaten my fair share of omakases in the city, prices ranging from $50-300. Service was fine. Food not so much. If I'm paying $250 for a meal, I better get top notch quality and something that amazes me and makes me want more. Here, I was not impressed with the quality (it's fresh but not $250 worth fresh- I'll throw it in $50 range if I had to assign a number to it). Nothing amazed me except for the unbearable taste of some fermented orange thing (I think they said Millet root or something to that nature) that was so hard to swallow down and keep down. Usually after omakases, I order more because it taste delicious and why not order more and try everything while I'm there. Here, I didn't even want the pieces that came with the omakase. I just lost my appetite almost half way through the thing. Some pieces were questionable- They sprinkle salt and put wasabi on top of the Uni. I questioned why but quickly realized after I put the piece in my mouth...it lacked the fresh texture that other places had. Their squid was omg...it tainted my mouth...felt like I was trying to eat soft clay. Their last item on the omakase was the fatty tuna hand roll. Something I love...and they managed to ruin.

5.0,1/31/2018,"Came here for lunch during winter 2018 restaurant week. A great value for such high quality food! The attention to detail is amazing - from service to decor... I felt like I was spoiled.Collectively we ordered the house made egg custard, tofu marinated persimmon/sesame tofu,  daikon with yellowtail, the Sukiyaki with Kobe beef ($20 extra), house made yokan jelly + fruits, and the brown sugar ice cream.The house made egg custard was packed with flavors but not overly salty. It had meat, shrimp inside the custard which was a surprise. The persimmon and sesame tofu was more like a dessert to me and seem odd as an appetizer. For the main, it came with (a generous portion of) rice, miso soup, and pickles. The Japanese yellowtail was very flavorful and worked well with the daikon. The highlight for us was definitely the Kobe beef sukiyaki. You get a small bowl of mushroom broth over a simmering fire. You then cook the slices of kobe beef in the broth. Let me preface by saying, I never had kobe beef sukiyaki before because I always thought it would be a waste to cook it hot pot style. However, this new experience really changed the game. The kobe beef was so soft and melts in your mouth. The broth also elevated the meat's flavor. I was really shocked at how good it taste and every bite left me wanting for more.The desserts were also decadent. The brown sugar ice-cream with mochi and red bean was very good. The green tea yokan jelly was interesting (like an elevated version of jello). The orange and strawberry fruit was very fresh.Overall the three course meal was on the smaller portion size, but the taste is up there.

4.0,1/26/2018,"For my first review of 2018 (yes, I am slightly late), I decided to write one for the renowned famous Satsuki, a 2018 Michelin star sushi bar. My expectations were high after reading all professional reviews of this bar, which set the bar high when moment I walked in.A bit difficult to find. You have to walk down the stairs (yes, its in the ""lower level""). Don't get me wrong though, once you are downstairs, you head left for the Three Pillars bar and a reception desk to the right. It was awfully quiet, but sleek, modern and dark. I expected a Michelin star restaurant to have a grand entrance with a host greeting you, but I was left trying to find the entrance of this place to the side of the US Trust buildingThe service was simple and not what I would expect from a Michelin star restaurant. The entire lower level consist of the Three Pillars bar, but also the Suzuki restaurant and then also the fame Satsuki sushi bar. The bar was a simple modern space with wooded wall panels, where the chef was to one side, and the guest (up to 10) sitting on the other. As your Omakase was pre-ordered, there was no menu -- just a selection of beer, sake or wine. We opt for the Sushi Omakase for $130 and a Sappore draft - which came out to $150 plus tip. The experience starts once your party is seated where they present you with two boxes of freshly delivered sashimi from Tokyo and Spain. The chef's knife skills are impeccable and it is worth taking a moment to divulge yourself in the atmosphere and ambiance.Aside from the eel from Hokkaido and soup, the omakase is deliver to you singly on a plate that sits between yourself and the chef, which made the reach a bit odd and potential room for sauce to drip onto the table in front of you. Chopsticks or your hands were encourage as utensils (they provide a little wet hand wipe). My favorite was the fatty tuna. The texture and freshness of the tuna alone was enough for you to skip a heart beat. I also noticed that this was the only moment the chef paused to watch us slip this into our mouth to see our reaction... and yes he got it. The uni was also worth a mention out of the 10 nigiri, 1 handroll, one egg with salted cucumber, and a miso soup.All in all, this was a fantastic experience, the ambiance, the nigiri and atmosphere --- but I am surprised to see this as a Michelin star restaurant for the following reasons: 1) would have been nice to learn more about the fish on paper - maybe my fault but I could not understand the chef's heavy accent 2) no spoon available even though soup was served -- i thought this was a Michelin star criteria. 3) poor entrance to an otherwise fantastic interior. The interior designer is the star in all this.For a $200+ minimal meal, I would have expected nothing short of excellent in every detail, but this fell a bit short.

It began with edamame, then an elegant tray containing miso soup, two kinds of pickles, a small sweetened piece of homemade tofu, excellent tempura -- three small trout and 3 vegetable pieces with rice, sashimi with very fine fluke (3) and two each of tuna and salmon.  I had no room for dessert, only tea. The service was impeccable. The décor is dark modern simplicity. I look forward to returning soon.",0,0,0,George G.,"Manhattan, NY",0,20,0
4.0,9/21/2017,"KenScale: 8.5/10It was my wife Jun's birthday recently, and I was searching for a new place that I could take her out to celebrate. We haven't had a good sushi dinner in a while, so I figured why not try for one of the many new places that have opened in NYC recently? I haven't been to Sushi Zen before it closed last year, but its former chef Toshio Suzuki was quite well-known for his trailblazing contribution for introducing the beauty of sushi in the city. He recently launched a new project where he would helm the intimate 10-person sushi counter while there is also bigger dining space that focuses on traditional Japanese kaiseki courses. Was his sushi counter at Satsuki a life-changing experience? Hard to make a bold statement like that, but nevertheless we very much enjoyed our dinner on a recent Saturday evening.The omakase option at Satsuki is certainly not cheap, at $250 per person (there is also cheaper sushi-only option at $130 per person). In addition to 10-piece nigiri pieces, chef Suzuki and his younger counterpart prepare a series of fresh seafood-centric dishes. Some of these starter dishes turned out to be our favorite, and we actually liked this pre-nigiri course better than the actual nigiri one. Sashimi featured some interesting combinations with vegetables like lean tuna with kelp or a block-shaped combination of tuna and yam. Jun and I were both astounded by the lightly blow torched king salmon and salmon roe in a cup for its complexity of flavor and texture. I don't know how the chefs thought of making deep fried sardine covered by spicy rice cracker and with scallion on top, but the dish was another winner of the night, as we both savored these blissful bites that showed the level of attention to details and dedication that these Japanese masters approached their craft with. How about the actual sushi part? Our experience was somewhat more mixed there. Overall, the fish was consistently fresh and the texture of rice (with plum vinegar added on top) was also satisfying. There is no need to dip your nigiri into soy sauce; the chefs already season each fish or add ingredients like chive or ginger on top to add subtle flavor to the fish. Some pieces like striped jack, golden eye snapper and bonito were quite good, and I think the sea eel and fatty snapper pieces that we had were respectively one of the best I've tasted in a while. On the other hand, there were some pieces that made us puzzled, like the white squid that was too murky in its texture or the scallop where the chefs put too much salt on top. When I visit a sushi restaurant, the two most important pieces personally for me in judging a restaurant's worth are fatty tuna (o toro) and sea urchin (uni). The o toro at Satsuki was delicious but not quite at the level that wowed either of us, and uni curiously lacked textural layers that I had seen at other sushi places. On the other hand, our last savory course, followed by a miso soup with very aromatic flavor, was this awesome fatty tuna hand roll with scallion and pickles; the crunchy texture of pickles worked beautifully with the fatty tuna inside for a blissful combination.   The sushi counter seats only 10 people as noted, so making a reservation in advance is always highly recommended. We both liked the intimate setting of the sushi counter that works perfect for special occasions. Both chefs were approachable and the overall service was quite inviting and charming too. There are wine, beer and sake selections you can choose from, and I liked the fact that the sake options are available in carafe portions too. Satsuki is one of those places that is perhaps best checking out for special occasions or if you are the type of person who spares no expenses when it comes to sushi eating. The value proposition was a bit steep, but nevertheless you will be able to find some really interesting and fresh seafood here.",1,0,1,Ken S.,"Manhattan, NY",512,612,4738

As side dishes there was mushroom in steamed egg, a sesame paste with something white dish, picked things, miso soup, and a large bowl of rice.The hanakago dish had what seemed like 4-5 pieces of sashimi, 2 pieces of delicious cod, some fried shrimp and chicken, vegetable dish, sesame paste with something white dish, miso soup, and a large bowl of rice.Both lunches tasted delicious but I thought the hanakago dish was much more filling and worth the price.The service was good, waited on hand and foot.

4.0,8/7/2017,"I wasn't too hungry, and the various prix fixe options weren't all that different so went with the $75 set with the $25 sushi upgrade.  We also tried the Fujiyuki cocktail and the shochu/plum wine cocktail.  Both pretty good.Service was really good.  We ordered the oyster gratin course a la carte, and the waiter brought it exactly in the order it would have been in the prix fixe.  I also liked that the waiter always waited for a break in conversation instead of interrupting mid-sentence.  (I'm surprised how many waiters at Michelin starred restos aren't polite enough to do this simple but thoughtful thing!)I've never been to Japan and the only Kaiseki I've been exposed to was at the old Sugiyama restaurant in midtown (since closed).  So can't comment on authenticity but the overall experience was pleasant.  The decor is.. NYC hotel restaurant style decor.  Sleek and on the fancy side (a nice sparkly chandelier out in the front) but maybe a little too shiny and not as understated as some other Japanese places.  The food wares are pretty though.  Food itself is solid.  Liked the sashimi and soup courses the most.  Also really like the red shiso prosecco that came with the first unagi and sesame tofu course.  The highlight was probably the Fujiyuki drink.  Unfortunately the prix fixe didn't include wagyu beef mentioned in many other reviews, and we didn't have the stomach space to order it a la carte. Finally, there's also a (not crowded at all surprisingly!) bar area and a separate tiny (fully seated) sushi bar in the same space as this restaurant.  Will definitely come back to try, especially as the drinks and sushi were both better parts of the meal.",0,0,0,Sallie D.,"Manhattan, NY",207,227,3461

It's kind of like an interaction with food and see how it tastes differently by spending 5 second and 10 seconds, using lemon or not. Many courses have different layers and combinations, bet you never get bored. Btw the service was good too--we had a few questions and they were answered in details with patience and elaboration.

5.0,6/1/2017,"Years ago a friend told me that if I ever had the chance, I should go try the Omakase course at Sushi Zen offered by Toshio Suzuki. When I finally decided to take his advice late last year; I was disappointed to learn that Sushi Zen had closed down. So when I saw that Chef Suzuki was again offering an Omakase course at a new location, I excitedly made a reservation and was not disappointed. Moral of this story is I should have listened to my friend sooner.Satsuki is an intimate 10-seat sushi counter located within Suzuki hidden a block away from the Times Square Area. Chef Suzuki and his staff deliver an amazing experience, in what I can only describe as the true spirit of Japanese-style hospitality. The food was flavorful and well balanced; the seasoning of the rice was delicate allowing the flavor of the fish to shine. The marinated tuna and uni were my favorite. The cocktails from the accompanying Three Pillars Lounge creative and unique. The Fujiyuki in particular was visually stunning with crushed ice in the shape of Mt. Fuji atop the cocktail in the middle of a wide rim bowl plate, it was just slightly impractical for me to have to sip from a straw placed into a bowl. Still is was amusing and reminiscent of my childhood spent drinking slushies from the corner deli.",1,0,1,Andy T.,"San Francisco, CA",1,2,0

So fortunate that today they've got the uni from Hokkaido, that nothing could ever beat! Also really enjoyed the sushi vinegar rice, marinated to just the perfect level. Temperature was handled well too. Everything was executed flawless.Two seatings per night for the full Omakase course - 730 or 930pm.

4.0,5/12/2017,"My friend and I had the $130 omakase at 5:30. It included 11 nigiri, one egg, pickled cucumber, one hand roll and a miso soup.  It's probably mid-price range in terms of omakases being served in NYC. The fishes in the omakase were flavorful and expertly treated.  The rice however is pretty bland and doesn't quite hold together well.  This allows the flavors of the fishes to stand out but I personally like my rice to be more powerful. We also ordered four additional pieces that were offered for the day, and those were not as good as what was offered in the omakase. Also, the pacing of meal was pretty terrible. We were given pretty much all 12 courses of the omakase within 30 mins. (We did end up staying longer because we ordered additional pieces, dessert, and a bottle of sake.) There were times where pieces were put on our plate before we even finished our previous piece. This made the whole experience feel rushed and not quite so enjoyable.  As for the price, it ended up being around 650 (including tax and tips) for two omakases, two desert, 8 extra nigiri pieces, and a bottle of sake.",4,1,2,Jianna L.,"Manhattan, NY",99,24,208

I had $150 Uzuki, the only dish I really love is Wagyu beef, everything else is just flat and bland. I thought Kaiseki was supposed to use most fresh ingredient, but I didn't feel that in my dinner.  When you put a dry ,dark red color, clearly dying strawberry on the supposedly elaborated desert plate, is that a big turn off? And also the pickled vegetables tastes and looks exactly like that in my $10 bento box from local convenient store, that is a big no.  I generally just don't feel the delicate effort is there.",3,1,0,zi x.,"Manhattan, NY",3,189,0
5.0,5/1/2017,"Amazing experience.My friend and I splurged and got the Uzuki ($150pp), but next time I'd want to come back for the chef's tasting, which can only be done with 3 days' advance notice so they have time to procure ingredients.The Uzuki menu had 10 courses, though each one had multiple elements. I won't say that the dishes were the most perfect example of themselves (e.g. I've had better uni, miso cod, etc., elsewhere), but everything was impeccably prepared and plated. Probably one of the most creative and fun dining experiences I've had since my meal at Atera.Food highlights included the A5 wagyu sukiyaki, otoro and akami sashimi, and shiizakana, which was a baked apple smothered in melted cheese.Drinks were smooth, strong, and continued the creative theme. I especially enjoyed the Fujiyuki, which was served as a mountain of ice (to evoke Mt. Fuji) with liquor poured around it. My friend got a drink that came as two shots and a side of milk served in a cow carafe.One small nit is I wish the dining area felt less...corporate? It almost felt like I was back in Aquavit.

5.0,4/5/2017,"To call Chef Suzuki-San anything other than a legend in the sushi world would be short changing a man who has shaped sushi as we know it today. Formerly the head chef at Sushi Zen for over 30 years, this man trained other legends, including Iron Chef Morinoto, and created what are now the most commonplace sushi dishes (he is the creator of the inside out roll). Satsuki is his return to his beginnings with a focus on Edo style sushi. To begin the meal, Suzuki-San presented us with all of the cuts of fish we would be having for the night, all flown in from Japan. The 5:30 omakase consists of about a dozen pieces of sushi, soup, and a hand roll. Many of the pieces served are familiar (squid, shrimp, a few different cuts of tuna, uni, eel, tomago, etc), but prepared exquisitely, and clearly show decades of honed craft. The standouts for me were the marinated tuna and surprisingly, the shrimp. There was not a disappointing bite in the entire meal. Where Satsuki really distinguishes itself from every other omakase place is in its staff. The sake sommelier offered us some samples of some recommended sakes we had never tried. Marc, the manager of the three restaurants, gave us a personally guided tour of the restaurant before dinner. The bartender at the three pillars let us sample some rare ingredients that were literally an explosion of flavor. Chef Suzuki-San makes makes for an immersive and personal dining experience and shares his experience in dining, sushi, Japan, New York, and anything else that comes up. The $130 priced 5:30 omakase seating puts this right in between the value spots (Tanoshi, Dojo, Kura), and the pricier spots (Nakazawa, Cagen, Zo). The restaurant is probably one of the nicest actual spaces of any of the omakase spots, the quality of the sushi is in the top third of the NYC omakase spots, but the service is hands down the best, most attentive, and personal of all the omakase spots.
