5.0,4/8/2019,"Add this Steak place to your list, so impressed with Empire Steak House.  We decided to order the Filet Mignon and the Pappardelle Pasta and share them, also ordered a couple of side dishes.  Our waiter took the time to have the items split in 1/2 and served to us. We were blown away by the size of the portions after being split.  Pic of steak on my plate is my half! Everything was delicious.  I can't say enough about the ""Wait"" staff and Manager Deca Nikocevic- all were so attentive and knowledgeable of food and wine.  This is an old school style steak place. Big tall booths, crystal chandelier- just a beautiful place.  Nice bar to sit and have a cocktail before dinner too.  We're from L.A. so this may be one of my new places to stop for a cocktail when in town. Potato chips in basket at bar... not pretzels Several birthday celebrations were happening that night and the staff treated each table with sincere enthusiasm.",0,0,0,Carolyn C.,"Long Beach, CA",1,32,22

1.0,3/22/2019,"My husband and I were early for reservations, everything went great we placed or order received out drinks and salad. Waiting for our steak, came out. Looking across the restaurant and big party across from us our waiter was taking that party and it went down hill from than on..we ate ordered desserts another waiter brought us which was fine. Never saw our waiter again, only to look across and see home with the big table.. never refills or asked if we wanted refills of coffee, we waited 30-45 min for check not one person came by. We finally went up to front desk to get check.. all manager said was sorry and gave us to ports, not even asked us if we liked ports just assumed.. never did waiter come by say sorry , manager just said sorry never asked us what happened just walked off..

5.0,3/16/2019,"Omg steak! I've found my new favorite steakhouse! I was here last night with friends. We were all out to celebrate st Patrick's day and I was actually debating going out but I'm so glad I did. When you walk into this place, it's very apparent that you are in for the best of New York. Everything inside is so emaculant and beautiful. I have to admit that when they said empire steak, I was thinking that it would be a cheesy touristy steakhouse. Boy was I wrong!There were four of us and we ordered the porthouse, a Cesar salad, broccoli, potatoes and creamed spinnach. We ordered the giant sharable platters! I've never had creamed spinnach before but I was with others and I'm willing to try anything once. It was a fairly pleasent experience!  I am deffinatly putting it on my new favorite foods list. The potato was absolutely cooked to perfection. I completely savored every bite of broccli! The best part was the steak though of course. Now, I've been to quite a few steak houses, but this deffinatly was the best steak I've ever eaten in my whole life. Omg... Just phenomenal! I cant say enough good things about it!The service was absolutely positively the best service I've ever received from any resturant in my whole life. The servers were so attentive and so friendly and so amazing. I will be back and will be recommending this place to anyone who asks me where to get a good steak. It's just that amazing!",5,1,4,Jazmine D.,"New York, NY",1037,418,1337

3.0,2/14/2019,"We scored a last minute reservation for restaurant week.  We had to wait half an hour for a table, but were accommodated on short notice, so it was fine.  The space is wild- feels like a night club instead of a restaurant.  The tables are a bit close together, so we got a bunch of second hand convo.  The waitstaff were nice and attentive.  You can't argue with three courses at a steakhouse for $42.  There were also deals on wine.  The food was solidly OK.  My guess is that you can't really judge this restaurant based on their restaurant week offering.  It was a good deal and a  pleasant meal.",0,0,0,Joel S.,"New York, NY",37,675,16

1.0,2/10/2019,"We must have just picked a bad night to dine here. Our last night in town, after a fantastic brunch at The Smith earlier in the day, we chose Empire for a nice steak dinner on recommendation by our  concierge. We were clad in concierge approved tourist attire, for 41 degree non stop pouring rain. We were looking forward to a great filet meal with all of the accoutrements. Our first clue that something was a miss was the difficulty just finding the entrance. In pouring rain and in what looked like an entrance under construction, the three of us follow the computer printed signs that show the way to ""Empire Entrance"". We thought it must be some kind of joke, it was like an escape funhouse...winding upward staircase that lead to a locked door. We then go back out to the street and try again to get into the restaurant...WHO HAS TWO CONFUSING ENTRANCES?!After the initial deer in the headlights reaction to our reservation on the Hostess's part, we were sat at a huge round booth under a stairwell. Next to a loud party of six. After a long wait a random person drops off bread, after another long wait our waiter took our drink and appetizer orders. We complimented our handsome waiter that he very much resembled Elvis. OUR EVENING WENT DOWN IN A BLAZING SPIRAL OF FLAMES FROM THERE. An extremely long time passed by the time the appetizer was delivered, before the drinks. Then finally the drinks were delivered. Another lengthy time elapsed before our dinner orders were taken. All while other tables in the restaurant were doted on with attentive service....From my seat, I can see into the kitchen area where waiters come and go and prepare beverages, the maitre d at one point comes out into the restaurant and scratches his crotch...I just don't know what to say. I don't want to see that, who does?!After a considerable wait, and before dinner arrived, an ambulance with strobe lights blinking is parked in front of the entrance...with concern, my husband goes to see what the flashing light is from...well, a patron sitting at the bar has passed out. He is rolled out of the bar on a gurney. ???? Our dinner was served while Hubbs was making sure that we were safe with the commotion that was between us and the exit. At this point our waiter is no where to be found. We flag down another waiter and ask for ""Elvis"" to come to our table. ANOTHER, waiter comes and announces that our waiter had to leave to pick up his kids and asked ""he didn't tell you""???? So, trying to make light of the situation, we joked and said Elvis really has left the building. In conclusion, we wasted over two hours and three hundred dollars. Wish I could have the time and $$$$ back. With so many fabulous options in NYC, please choose another restaurant with better everything. I don't ever write negative reviews, I try to focus on  something that was of merit but this was such a disappointment in every way possible that I think it's worth posting to others visiting to steer clear of Empire.",0,0,0,Gina S.,"French Quarter, Charleston, SC",20,3,0
3.0,2/9/2019,"I will preface this by saying that this is the second time that I have been here (also for restaurant week previously). My first experience of it was pretty great so we decided to come again for restaurant week 2019 with some friends. The food is definitely a 4.5 for me which is why we came back and the service last time was great too. The reason this review doesn't reflect what I think of the food has to be because the service. We made a reservation for 6 people at 7:30 PM on a Friday night. We called the restaurant to let them know we would be 10 minutes late because of public transportation traffic and delays. They said that it was okay and there would be no issues. When we got there the waiting area was pretty packed and we talked to the hostess and she told us that there would be a 5-10 minute wait while they were clearing and setting up the table. So the six of us are just waiting and then we slowly see most of the people in the waiting room get seated before us which was fine because maybe they had reservations too or they were smaller parties so they were able to get seated faster. We asked for updates about 3 times, but every time they kept saying things like 5 minutes or 3 minutes more, but before I knew it we had been waiting for an hour after our reservation time, which I thought was a bit ridiculous. We might as well just have not made a reservation. I understand that if we had a big party I could expect to have a little bit of a longer wait, but we had 6 people in our group... not really that large. The regular dining area looks very plush and bustling and the ambiance is nice, but we got seated upstairs which is much smaller, darker, but somehow still loud because they were playing some sort of club music, not really the music I thought I would hear at this sort of restaurant. Our waiter was really nice, but I felt like we were a little neglected. Our entire time here just was so long. I didn't mind much because we were with our friends and we weren't in too much of a hurry to get back home, but we arrive around 7:40PM, didn't get seated until 8:30PM and didn't leave the restaurant until 10:45PM... Like I said, I wasn't in a rush, but I wasn't trying to have dinner be an all night affair.. The appetizer took a little while to come out, then the entree took a while to come out and then we had to wait for dessert too and then finally the paying of the bill. Overall, the service was a little disappointing and definitely felt like we were not valued as much as diners because we were there during restaurant week. I remember having an amazing meal the last time that I came so I was looking forward to another great tasting meal. It just didn't start off on a great note. I ordered the calamari, boneless rib eye and then got the chocolate mousse cake to go because I knew I wouldn't be able to finish everything. The calamari tasted great and I thought it was cooked really well as it wasn't rubbery and it was very tender and delicious although it was seasoned with a little bit of a heavy hand. The steak was actually much bigger than I remembered but there was quite a bit of fat on it that I cut off because it was just too much. The flavor was great and the cook of medium rare was perfect for me, but it was again a little strongly seasoned for my taste. The mashed potatoes are always my favorite as they're really soft and smooth and seasoned perfectly. The broccoli was also really delicious and the garlic pieces and flavor was yummy. I haven't tried the chocolate mousse cake, but my friend who also got it said that it was a bit underwhelming. I tried my husband's tiramisu at the restaurant and I thought it tasted really good.All in all, I'm just a little disappointed by the service and the experience we had being seated upstairs after waiting an hour after our reservation time, but I still really enjoyed the food. I don't know if we'll be back here again though in the future.",1,0,0,Jane C.,"Manhattan, NY",301,91,127
5.0,2/9/2019,I had the pleasure of dining here during restaurant week. Although the menu was pre-selected there was still an option for a variety of tastes buds.

1.0,2/6/2019,"BEWARE! Don't waste your money here. Me and my friends came here for restaurant week. Our server was disrespectful with terrible service for higher end restaurant like this . First, he did not give us share plates when we specifically told him we are going to share the appetizers. we igored that because we try not to ruined our dinner so we used the small plates that's for the breads.Than the manager saw these and told him to give us the share plates. Second, he came with the share plates and kettle and said"" you guys are almost finish"" and walk away with the kettle without refilling the water for us! The manager tried to make up for his mistakes but we don't care because this server kept coming back to disgusted us! OK! This is what really pissed me off. If you don't want to serve us. Please don't bother us! Let other people do the job. But If you do，Please do your job and not just refill the water with an piece of ice WITH NO WATER to my glass！I don't know if it's because we look Younger than our age so he thinks we can not afford it or because we did not order any alcohol so he thinks we are cheap!

3.0,2/4/2019,"Came here during restaurant week with two of my girlfriends. When you first come in, you are wowed by the decor and granduer of the place. The staff were very welcoming and accommodated us. For the dinner price for restaurant week plus the fact that they had $40 bottles as specials, it was one of the best restaurant week deals that I saw when it comes to steak. Everything was going well, the decor, the staff, but when the food came my steak was extremely salty and the peas was overcooked. It was such a shame because i really wanted to like the food but the only thing I really enjoyed was the sautéed spinach.Would I give this place another chance, yes i would. perhaps it can redeem itself next time around.",1,0,1,Hong L.,"Brooklyn, NY",317,656,218
2.0,2/4/2019,"After reading a lot of positive reviews about the Empire Steak House, we were eager to try it out during Restaurant Week. The place itself looks nice inside, but the first good impression was totally deceiving. We weren't offered a coat check which is weird in the middle of winter, but when I couldn't put anywhere my coat, they were able to squeeze it in somewhere. The waiters were negligent, inattentive and not polite. The broccoli soup was very good but the green salad is mediocre and the leafy greens weren't fresh. The bread basket was simply pathetic, apparently old and dry slices of bread were served. After my husband finished his salad with dressing, the waiter took his empty plate putting the dirty fork on the table! What the hell?! Don't they have a clean one to give it for the main dish?? The main for my husband was salmon which was okay, but my filet mignon was simply horrible. It smelled like burnt meat, and although it was entirely covered in a brown sauce, it was obvious from the smell and from the taste (!) that it was completely burnt, which is a total shame considering that this should be their absolute forte. Oh, and the steak knife I got was dirty, there was something like a leftover food on it... No one noticed it until I obviously asked for another one before starting to eat. The mashed potato and the broccolis were okay too (although adding the same side to ALL the main dishes lacks of imagination and  effort). It is also worth mentioning that the glass my water was served in was broken, and all the plates seemed very old and worn-out. After this terrible service and bad food we most definitely won't be returning.",1,1,0,Alexandra D.,"Brooklyn, NY",13,91,416

3.0,1/29/2019,"Food - 2 starsService - 4 stars Ambience - 3 starsI came for restaurant week during lunch time with another friend. The restaurant was pretty empty on the day we came so we were seated right away. We both ordered from the restaurant week menu and got the same appetizer which is the Sizzling Canadian Bacon. I have to give them credit for the bacon as it was pretty good. Now I ordered the filet mignon with mushroom sauce but they gave me a sirloin by accident. Once the waiter put down my food, I immediately notice that's not what I ordered so they took the food away as I patiently wait for my correct order. It's upsetting because my friend i already almost done with her sirloin when my filet finally came. Now the more upsetting part came, I cut out a small piece of my filet mignon to try it and the meat tasted a little spoil. At first I thought maybe it's the mushroom sauce so I  tasted the sauce separately and the sauce tasted perfectly fine. I cut a piece for my friend to try and she said the meat doesn't taste too fresh. At that point I didnt want the steak anymore so I started eating just the broccoli and mash potato. When the waiter ask me if everything is good, I had to tell him the filet is not fresh and immediately he said he will switch for me. He came back and said that the chef said the taste is from the mushroom sauce (which i know for sure it's not) and he switched it to a sirloin for me. Don't get me wrong, Im very happy that the service is really good and they're very accommodating but by that point, I'm already pretty disappointed with the foo. I quickly finished the sirloin and paid and left. I'm not sure if I will come back to give this restaurant another chance.

1.0,1/27/2019,"I'm confused why this place has 4 stars on Yelp. I don't know if the quality is just lower for restaurant week, but based on my experience on Friday, I would not want to come back. The drinks and bacon appetizer were okay, but everything really went downhill from here. I came here with a group of 4 and 2 of steaks that we ordered were uncooked to the point where it was inedible. Luckily my filet was cooked medium rare like I ordered, but the quality was not there. The filet was much tougher than I'd expect from a supposedly nice restaurant. The fries we ordered to share were also barely edible and looked like it was soaked in oil as if they were refried after sitting out for a while. Guests all around us also seemed to have the same issues and were generally disappointed with their meals. The servers were really nice and definitely apologetic but there wasn't much they could do. Even when they tried to send our food back to the kitchen, we didn't see any improvements.

4.0,1/26/2019,"Came here during winter restaurant week 2019. Made a reservation for 5 and selected this place because of the wide variety in their restaurant week menu. The front ladies are very nice and polite but the servers I think was a little lacking maybe because it was a friday evening and it was busy but felt like my take was a bit forgotten. It took them a while to bring us the menu after pouring waters on our cups. Then when it's time to order he said he'll take down the deserts later and when he came back he didn't bring us back the menu I mean most had their dessert in mind but some didnt really looked at it so would say best to have a menu at hand. Then I noticed a little rushed because more people came in and it's waiting in the bar area so after they collected our plates they have us the check. Appetizers we selected the Canadian bacon, fried calamari and caesar salad. Fried calamari is the winner!!! Would say it's one if the best i had. It was nice and crispy and doesnt taste greasy but the bacon was disappointment I thought there would be something that goes with it but it was just straight up a slice of bacon slap on your plate. The caesar salad wasn't bad. For entree we had the filet mignon, rib eyes and New York sirloin. Wasn't bad but not wowing. If you ask for medium well it'll be dry and the slice is pretty thin. They have pepper, salt and empire sauce on the table if you feel like getting tired of eating the steak refresh your taste buds with the sauce. They gave us the gravy for the mashed potatoes and it's not bad but heavy on the black pepper. I actually bit down into one and it kind of burnt my throat. And the steaks aren't as tender as I hope it'll be even for the fillet mignon in medium rare. I like the broccoli too it actually has flavor might be chicken stocks but normally it would just be steamed broccoli. Dessert we picked the tiramisu, chocolate mousse cake and ice cream they only have vanilla and chocolate. Tiramisu is pretty good and it tasted very creamy like whipped cream which I don't think is necessary to add whipped cream on the side would say hoping it was ice cream instead. I liked the crust of the chocolate mousse cake but then again I would still think it's pretty heavy after the steak. They had NY cheesecake but I know I won't be able to finish that heavy over heavy. Overall I think I would recommend this place and come back again for another restaurant week",1,0,0,Elsie H.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",1,65,89
1.0,1/26/2019,"Alright, so not sure if it was just restaurant week or what, but the meal was incredibly disappointing. The good: - Service - Bacon. Could've been a bit crispier though, but not a big deal.  Now for the not so great.... - Sadly, the steak, which is the reason we even went to begin with. We had 4 people in our group. 3 of us ordered the filet mignon cooked medium rare, and I ordered the ribeye, also medium rare. Food came out quick, and all our steaks were cooked differently. My friend and I got our steaks so incredibly rare we couldn't even cut/chew it. My girlfriend's filet was cooked about medium rare, and our other friend got a medium. Attaching photos of the 3 filets so you can see.. We asked the server to have the rare steak recooked, and when it came back out the second time (within a couple minutes), same thing, still rare. We didn't bother asking to have it cooked again. By the end of the meal, half our steaks were still on our plate because it just wasn't edible.- Steak fries were $7 extra, and they came out soggy and brownish as if they were re-fried or left out for awhile...- My girlfriend got the cheesecake for dessert and there was freezer burn in the middle. Again, based on the good reviews, I was expecting much better. I don't know if it was because it's restaurant week and they were slammed, but it just wasn't a good experience. Throughout the night, we saw a few other tables that also had complaints on their food and spoke to the manager ( I assume that's who it was) at the table.

There are plenty of great options within a stones throw of this restaurant. Both the service and quality of the meat are subpar. We ordered the Filet mignon and the ribeye. We found both were extremely tough and chewy. It was impossible to run the steak knife through the meat. To top the whole dining experience off the manager came by and asked how our meal was. I shared that my ribeye was undercooked and rare. Instead of being apologetic and offering to cook the meat longer he said that if the chefs were to put the meat back on the grill that it would be overcooked and therefore would not be worth the struggle. This leads to me wonder why he even asked in the first place. I could go on and on about the poor experience at this steakhouse.

3.0,1/24/2019,"We camue dueing the 2018 spring restaurant week, came around 1 and the restaurant was half empty. The services were great, the Canadian bacon was thick and juicy and favorable, but everything went downhill from there on.Came here with a friend who ordered filet mignon and I ordered the sirloin.  The first time our steaks came they gave both of us sirloin and we had to change hers for the filet. When the filet finally came(at this point I was almost done with mine) it had a weird taste which reminded both of us of unfresh meat. The steak itself was very salty too,not sure if that meant anything. Our servicer insisted that weird taste was from the mushroom sauce,but we tasted the sauce separately and it was fine on it's own. So my friend decided to change back for the sirloin. Finally on round 3, her sirloin came only it had so much fat around the meat and tendons through out the whole steak we had to keep spitting them out( because they were too big for anyone to swallow,and yes I helped her to eat part of it too).We also got steak fries with additional $5, they were soggy from the beginning and many of them had the grayish stains on them,not sure what those were but we left them on the plate.

The waiter was very inexperienced. He tried faking it, but when he poured steak juice all over the table, and did nothing about it, clearly the owner or manager has failed at training their staff.

They brought us bread which was kinda cold, hard, and stale. We requested for new one and it was serviced swiftly so that was fine. Appetizer for bacon and salad was very good, that bacon was thick, juicy and soooo yummy so . Main entree, we ordered filet mignon and boneless rib eye. Rib eye had to be changed 2x; was well done when asked for medium, so asked for change, which then came as raw, then by the third it was closest to medium (and I felt bad) so left at that. I have to say their steak was yummy, however, like others were saying, steak was very thin, never really seen steak so thin at a proper steak house. filet was also very thin, almost like ...slab of liver thin..but again meats were decent.  Steak came with broccoli and mashed potato which were excellent.  Waitstaff didn't have attitude about the change, but think should have been bit more assertive, and started out with an apology followed by making sure it's done right after the first change. I asked him, ""I'm sorry do you think this is medium"" (bc first time was white meat, aka well down, and second red meat, aka raw) he just took the plate back. still I applaud the waitstaff for servicing without complaint or attitude, we all kno sometimes it's hard to find good waitstaff in NY. Desserts were not bad, but presentation could be better. Overall good quality, venue and service was decent for the price. However, I think they could do a better job, even if it's RW pricing. A lot of ppl use the RW to test out restos, so wouldn't hurt to be bit more attentive. thanks for reading.",3,0,1,Judy L.,"Manhattan, NY",128,182,527

I called back really upset. The hostess said nobody checked the Yelp reservations until today and that they were too full to accommodate us. It took some back and forth conversation for her to suggest moving us to the west side location. I didn't like the look of that location for our special occasion and I wanted to avoid going cross town and getting caught in traffic and holiday crowd.

A steak comes back to our table 2 minutes later (I'm puzzled... you can't cook a steak that size in 2 minutes) and this time it was definitely Well done and charred to a crisp. The server came and even he had no words except to bring us a fresh steak again and this time I asked for Rare. It came back medium but at this point, I'd been hungry, starving and now full on side dishes because this establishment that calls themselves a steakhouse cannot distinguish between rare, med rare, med, med well and well done.

5.0,9/12/2018,"A rundown of my experience at Empire Steak House this evening. Service was outstanding. I swear the staff was literally double timing it around the dining room. Attention to the diner was amazing. The items I ordered:Shrimp Cocktail - unbelievably large shrimp with a nicely made cocktail sauce. The shrimp were so big I had to use a fork and knife to eat it!  And it was tasty. Tomato and Mozzarella salad - this was the low point of my experience.  It was ok. But I just don't understand how steak houses (not just Empire) can live with themselves serving grocery store tomatoes for what they charge. Please, for the love of God, spend the extra 50 cents per serving for an Heirloom tomato, or something off the vine. It's a small detail that goes a long way with us tomato lovers. Now for the steak - I ordered the bone-in Cajun Ribeye.  This was, no joke, one of the top five steaks I've ever had. And I'm a steak snob. The flavor was amazing. The Cajun seasonings tasted great without overwhelming the steak. The meat was perfectly cooked.  And I can't believe I'm going to write this.  No steak lover would ever try the steak sauce in a million years.  On a whim, I decided to try it.

Went with the cream of broccoli soup and New York strip along with an old fashioned to start. The old fashioned was almost sickly sweet filled with crushed ice that melted super quickly so almost immediately turned into something that tasted like a watered down cinnamon soda. The cream of broccoli soup was actually decent, but the steak was quite lacking. What looked at first like a nice crust turned out to be for the most part charred bits that were not edible. Even though I asked for medium rare the center looked closer to medium and was a bit tough to chew. My girlfriend opted for the filet mignon which was much more tender but the mushroom sauce it was served with was pretty salty and covered up the flavor of the meat.

2.0,8/8/2018,"I have been to most every steakhouse in New York City. This was a new one to me, and the reviews were fairly good and the history respectable, what with the usual Peter Luger connection. So I tried it.We made the mistake of ordering off the restaurant week menu, and found that the sirloin steak provided was of the size and texture one would expect at Bonanza, Ponderosa, or any of a number of 1970s steakhouse chains famous for the open, illness-inducing salad bars. This size and cut of steak at Empire would get you a full refund at Club A, the Strip House (the one in the Village) or Minetta Tavern, the three best steakhouses in the city. This disappointment, of course, is most likely due to Empire not wanting to waste a traditional, New York steakhouse-size and quality cut of beef on cheap tourists who ordered from the restaurant week menu. My friends and I, however, have lived in New York for 30 years. And while I understand such a financial imperative, not telling customers they are going to get the pony meat is dirty pool.So we got what we paid for I suppose. I am of course giving Empire the benefit of the doubt and assuming that, had we ordered off the regular menu, we would have gotten a valiant attempt at a 1"" thick charred sirloin, as one would expect. But who knows? Maybe the 1/2 inch gristle version is what you get for full price, too. I'm not going to go back to find out.It also didn't help that the waiter brought us a bottle of wine we didn't order, but again, while the quality was lower than what we wanted, the price, like that of the steaks, was cheaper.

We were a little worried about whether or not there was a dress code, or if we were under-dressed. The staff, however, made us feel very welcome and seated us right away.    After being seated, having napkins placed on our laps for us, we soon realized that we were eating in a fine-dining establishment. Most everything on the menu is ala-cart. We ordered Filet-mignon for two, german potatoes, and asparagus. We were considering also ordering a cup of soup, which was cream of broccoli. The waiter was kind enough, however, to advise us against that. He informed us that it would not pair well with our steak, which we never would have thought about on our own.    After sipping on our pre-dinner cocktails, our food arrived. We were treated like royalty. We had three servers, each of whom served up our plates with our food. When I was nearly done with my first serving of filet, the waiter was quickly at our table to serve me a second portion. Likewise, when my wife reached for more aujus for her steak, the waiter beat her to the punch and did it for her.   Our 45 day, dry-aged filet, which we ordered medium rare, was the best we have ever had.  After dinner we had a Tiramisu and 2 shots of espresso.   The restaurant looked as it was an old school show and dinner venue.",0,0,0,Peter H.,"Mukilteo, WA",0,3,1

We ordered the calamari, sizzling Canadian Bacon and the soup of the day which was the chicken and rice. All the apps were really delicious but the sizzling Canadian Bacon was the favorite. It was super succulent and savory. The calamari was a close second. It practically melted in your mouth. For the entrees we ordered the Prime NY sirloin, filet mignon and the salmon. The sirloin was a little tough and more medium well than medium rare. Honestly, my recommendation is the filet mignon. OMG it was so buttery and tender. It was soo good. The salmon was also pretty good als, but the star of the show was by far the filet mignon. All the dishes came with a side of mashed potatoes and broccoli which was also pretty good. For dessert we ordered the chocolate mousse cake and the tiramisu. The chocolate mousse cake was silky smooth with a cookie crust. The tiramisu was a let down honestly. It was pretty much all cream and no coffee flavor. It was also icy in the middle which was really off-putting. Paying for the meal was a little weird though because they lost my boyfriend's card.

I do like it when it's a big crispier, but I can't deny how fresh it tasted and how delicious the dipping sauce was. I followed up with a Caesar Salad with Homemade Dressing, which I'm a huge fan of because you can taste the salty anchovies. The salad is big enough to share, but I ate the whole thing. For dinner I ordered the Prime New York Sirloin Steak, medium-rare. $52.50. Rarely have I had a piece of meat that melts in your mouth. This was made with such care. Nice bits of charred meat on the side yet moist and juicy inside. For sides we shared; Sautéed Mushrooms and Asparagus. The flavor on both was so delicate, the enhanced the sirloin. I honestly only ate a small amount, didn't want to fill up and not enjoy the meat. I asked for a side of the dipping sauce for the calamari to dip my sirloin.

Bread was put on table and was the only ""free"" item included with dinner. I had to order a side of asparagus which were not throughly done and not even al dente, and cost $12. Steak was over cooked and lobster was tough and had pieces of shell, and cost $75. My companion ordered lobster raviolis and recieved 5 pieces for $30 and nothing else came with it not even salad.

From the moment we walked through the doors, our party of 8 was treated like the Royal Family. From beginning to end, it was a truly fun and special dinner.I dined with my Dad and my siblings, along with some of their wives. The girls and I shared some red wine. They have a WONDERFUL wine list here. And, in my opinion, the bottle prices are very reasonable. The boys all had bourbons, of which they have many varieties. My sister in law had a few martinis and said they were superb. My SO and I ordered a Caesar salad to split, the Emperor's Steak for Two, mashed potatoes, and broccoli. The chateaubriand on the main dish was the best piece of meat I have ever had the pleasure of eating. The sirloin was also very good. The Caesar salad was amazing, and the dressing was beautiful. My dad had a piece of sea bass and he loved it! It was a huge piece and he couldn't finish it all. I didn't eat any of the potatoes, but everybody else loved them. I did enjoy the sautéed broccoli. My brothers' told me the macaroni was amazing. We didn't have room for dessert, but i will definitely order some next time. All of the sides here are basically family sized. We all ordered entree sized steaks and a side or two per couple and it was plenty of food, but we ate pretty much everything. All of us ordered salads or soups too.

4.0,3/28/2018,"Comparing to what I had at Bowery Meat Company, Empire steakhouse should get 5 star from New York Time. At 7:00 on Wednesday night, the restaurant was already packed and busy. We were welcomed immediately even though we didn't have a reservation. At beginning, I felt my waiter asking too many questions, kindly pushing, such as if we each are going to order our own appetizer, salad or main course or share and even ask whom we are going to share. However, after food was on the table, I found he did remember how many people are going to share each food so I feel so sorry for my judgement. Our orders were Porterhouse for Two and Dry-Aged Tomahawk Rib-eye. Dry-Aged Tomahawk Rib-eye is so good and finally understand why people are crazy(price also) about it. Look at the long-bone of Tomahawk rib-eye steaks, such impressive piece, with a little sea salt and ground pepper.. perfectly well seasoned and the aging process definitely provide its own unique flavor.  wrong thing about this steak is we ordered medium but it was medium-well.",1,0,0,Amy L.,"Exton, PA",6,147,1719

For the main dish, I got the boneless rib eye and it was amazing. The meat was soft and tender and cooked medium rare, just how I ordered it. For dessert I ordered the tiramisu and being that tiramisu is one of my favorite desserts, I was a little disappointed in this one. The service was a bit slow but that's to be expected because it was busy. One thing that irked me was that when the check came, the waiter handed it directly to my date (a guy) rather than me and so I just handed the waiter my card directly to let him know I was paying, but still when he came back to get the signature, he still handed it to my date, rather than myself.",0,0,1,Morgan H.,"Queens, NY",228,110,171

2.0,2/7/2018,"Came here during restaurant week to celebrate a friend's birthday. The service was really great, except at the end when it took us forever to flag down our waiter for the check (it got really busy by then so it's understandable) so my review is mainly based on the food. Tomato & mozzarella - You got three slices of a huge tomato (beef steak tomato) and two pieces of fresh mozzarella, topped with some pesto, which was a nice change from the usual balsamic vinegar however I had to dunk it in the steak sauce for some flavor because the pesto was too mild of a flavor to dress up the dish. I'm no expert on mozzarella, but the ingredients tasted really fresh. I would recommend this dish! My friend got the Caesar salad and it was literally just lettuce with Caesar dressing..Rib eye - This is where it goes downhill. The flavor on the steak was not bad and it was cooked to medium rare as requested (but not enough of a sear), but it just didn't seem like a great cut. It was not nicely marbled but instead had pockets of fat and a rubbery texture. Even for the restaurant week price, it wasn't worth it. My friends got the filet mignon and said the same thing - a filet mignon is typically round and thick, but their steak was the same thickness as my rib eye and not round at all. Although my ribeye wasn't terrible by any means, it was just not the quality of steak I would have expected from an expensive steakhouse like this. Maybe the steak from their regular menu is better, but I would not recommend them for restaurant week. Sides - Our steaks came with a side of mashed potatoes and sautéed broccoli. The mashed potatoes were so average and slattered in butter that I couldn't even eat it. The broccoli had good flavor but was way  too mushy which is really frustrating because how do you mess up the easiest side ever?? They don't let you substitute the sides so we ordered a side of steak fries - they were so good!Dessert - I got the tiramisu and I tried my friend's chocolate mousse cake. The tiramisu was below average (too much cream and zero coffee flavor)  and the mousse was too fudgey for me. Both were disappointing. Overall I was left pretty unimpressed. I will say the portions were very fair - the filet mignon was an 8 oz and my boneless rib eye was at least 10 oz (probably more). I was half expecting tiny steaks for their RW menu, but honestly I would've preferred smaller portions that taste better.",1,0,1,Lina Y.,"Flushing, NY",156,96,90
4.0,2/4/2018,"We came here for lunch during Restaurant Week and wow, I'm impressed. For $29, you get an filling meal that includes a starter, an entree, and dessert. I went all out and chose the bacon, sirloin, and tiramisu. Bacon was very fatty (as it should be), but unimpressionable. I tried my friend's Soup of the Day (broccoli) and it was light and delicious. My sirloin was cooked perfectly! Tender and evenly charred. It came with a side of buttery mashed potatoes. Tiramisu was plated nicely but I've had better ones. Given a second chance, I would've chosen the soup over bacon and the chocolate mousse over the tiramisu. The ambience was classy. The mahogany tables, velvet sofas, dimly lit chandeliers, and digital fireplace made this place very romantic, especially on a rainy afternoon. A combination of 80s lounge music and pop songs was played so it felt like we stepped inside an 80s film set on the upper east side or something. Since it was Restaurant Week, the service was slower. Make a reservation and expect 20-30 min. wait. The waiters were attentive (and attractive!) but were slightly distracted by the influx of customers from Restaurant Week. The only downside was that I thought sparkling water was free, but then they brought in a bottle and I got charged $10 for it (which is 5x the normal price).",1,0,0,Linny P.,"Berkeley, CA",75,58,12
3.0,2/2/2018,"I came here for a restaurant week, and you could tell the servers were hustling to get people out the door. I was in and out the door in 1 hour and 15 minutes!Anyway, I think the food was like a 3.5-4 stars that I would NOT have paid full price for, but the service was severely lacking. We were firstly not given the restaurant week menu. When asked for it, our waiter Adrian handed us the lunch menu instead of the dinner menu. Then he needed to be reminded to bring us our beer.We were served a complimentary bread basket with a spiced bread and a regular loaf, with some butter. Nothing to shout about there. For my appetizers, we got the calamari and the tomato and mozzarella. The calamari was ok - I think I prefer smaller rings for a greater crisp to meat ratio. The tomato and mozzarella had a subtle drizzle of olive oil and pesto which I think worked nicely. The mozzarella seemed quite fresh.I asked for my ribeye to be prepared medium rare, and my boyfriend asked for his filet mignon to be medium. They came out pretty much right as our appetizer plates was cleared away. I really enjoyed my steak - I thought it was cooked to the right medium rareness, and not just in the center, but 80% of it was medium rare. It doesn't have as delectable a crust as Keen's steaks, but Keen's is Keen's, after all. Unfortunately, my boyfriend's filet mignon was even rarer than mine. He was much too polite to return the dish. It was still tasty (and I helped him finish the more raw parts), but it's not fun to have sinew stuck in your teeth while still attached to a bolus of meat that has already gone down your gullet.For dessert, we were served hastily plated slices of chocolate mousse and tiramisu. The tiramisu was good. Again, it's delicious in the way my aunt's Thanksgiving tiramisu might be delicious - not a real looker but tasty all the same. The chocolate mousse had a bit of a stale, refrigerator flavor to it. I do enjoy the thick biscuity crust though.I would recommend this place for lunch during restaurant week.",2,0,1,Jin C.,"New York, NY",36,1100,328

(I'm not used to having my class refilled after every sip)For the food I had gotten the boneless ribeye steak, along with calamari for the app, and chocolate mousse cake for desert. I am a huge fan of seafood! I couldn't help but resist to order the seafood platter appetizer (half a lobster, half pound of crab meat, shrimps) they had at Market Price.  The seafood platter came out first and I was slightly disappointed (also considering this appetizer had almost cost as much as my steak) there was absolutely nothing special about any of the seafood items, very bland but the cocktail sauce did help a bit. I am not sure what I was expecting but this definitely was not it. But on to the winner, the steak. I've had tons of steak in my life, but I think this was my favorite so far! The steak was cooked to perfection nice pink in the center, charred on the outside but not burnt. Perfectly seasoned. I don't know what more to ask for, it was a flavor bomb in my mouth.

Maitre d took us off to press us to buy a $1500 bottle of wine for the table. After explaining that we weren't interested in spending that kind of money on wine didn't sink in they went on to push another oversized over-priced bottle. And when I actually asked about the wine he was pushing he didn't even know the variety- (it was a Cabernet). Left him & ordered a reasonable Barolo off the wine list for the few of us that drank wine. Surprise! They didn't have any, but they did have this one here for 3x as much. I frowned & ordered a reasonable Brunello. It was a great bottle. Tried to order another & the crap came out again. 'No more of that, but we do have this much much more expensive wine.'I fumed!!! I shut the guy down & ordered another reasonable bottle to his chagrine. I may not look like I know wine, but I'm married to a serious professional foodie & I know some wine.

3.0,10/27/2017,"I love surf and turf and honestly the food was mediocre. My little sisters celebrated their 24th birthday party here and we were a large party. So I believe the waiters did an amazing job at accommodating and serving our party. However, it was not the best steak or lobster that I had. Even more annoying was that my camera man was denied entry onto the dinning floor because he had on a hat.  When we spoke with the host he explained the policy was not discriminatory but one that is enforced on the dining floor. Hats are only allowed at the bar. I understand businesses set their own policies. However, why does it matter what people wear in 2017? Especially if that patron is not eating and only doing video production. Also, we felt the atmosphere was stifling. We were the youngest people there and had to be so mindful of our voices and speech. As well as the only women of color there that night. We consciously did not want to come across as the young, black and loud party. When we asked to listen to other music it was worded in a way that made it seem like the request was bizarre. The hostess worded the request as other music. I did not like the mash potatoes nor the broccoli.  I did enjoy their salad. I would not dine here solely because the food was ok. However I do believe the dining floor is beautiful from seating to lighting.",0,0,0,Isis R.,"Bronx, Bronx, NY",0,9,11

4.0,9/13/2017,"This review is long overdue. Came here for restaurant week in February on a Sunday for dinner. The prix fixe menu cost $42/person including an appetizer, entree, & dessert. This is such a good price, especially for a steakhouse (you know how expensive steaks can be!)For the appetizer, I believe I got the calamari (can't go wrong with it) and it was decent. My date got the eggplant parm and that was much better. Although the portion was small, it makes sense because they don't want you to be too full for your entree. I got the filet mignon (medium rare--how else would you get your steak!!) and he got the New York sirloin (also medium rare). The steaks were delicious, obviously, as expected from a steakhouse. For dessert, I got the chocolate mousse cake (too sweet for me) and he got the cheesecake (it was so good so get this). We also splurged on a $40 bottle of wine, which really hiked up the bill since it's almost priced as another person paying for another prix fixe meal, but we just couldn't have steak without wine!The service was great and so was the ambience. They have such a huge space that the seating is ample! The tables are pretty close to each other though, so not as intimate as I would've liked. Totally worth the price for restaurant week!",1,0,0,Iana D.,"Oakland Gardens, NY",244,106,309

The dish was French Fries which were very delicious and I think it was different from the fries I have tasted in China. With excellent flavor and cooked spot on, it was perfect! Furthermore, the Empire steak house has their own sauce which was very special and memorial. The service was absolutely good. The staff in this steak house was attentive and professional.

3.0,8/17/2017,"Another restaurant week review. Alright lets do this.Came for dinner, was welcomed by a very friendly hostess and manager who cleared the whole table of one of the booths for just the two of us. Felt very fancy walking in and being treated like so, however seeing some of the other customers and their range of apparel (from suits to t-shirts) made me doubt the class of the place. The ambiance was nice, it seemed upscale with all the servers dressed so formally, though.For $42 a person, the money was spent more on quantity rather than quality. I ordered the filet mignon, calamari and tiramisu and my friend the ny strip steak, Canadian bacon and cheesecake. The calamari was decent, nothing too special or exciting and the bacon was a literal strip, a bit burnt on the ends. The filet mignon was chewy and difficult to cut, seemingly falling apart. The steak was pretty good, and the mashed potatoes and broccoli that came as sides were commendable. The cheesecake was a bit disappointing, I felt bad showing my friend that this was NYC cheesecake since he had gotten it for novelty's sake. The tiramisu was very sweet and satisfying, a lot of coffee soaked into the ladyfingers. All of that food in addition to a basket of complimentary bread led to full stomachs and unfinished plates. Yep, definitely a quantity place.",2,0,0,Judy Z.,"Villanova, PA",437,78,268
3.0,8/13/2017,"Came here for restaurant week lunch on a Sunday. However, Yelp says they are closed for lunch on Sundays.Arrived as party of four and was seated on the booth in the main dining room.Apps:Thick Canadian bacon: This was pretty good, not too salty and not too much fat.Caesar salad: Taste like any other Caesar salad.Mixed green salad: Pretty good with vinaigrette dressing.Soup of the day: It was cream mushroom soup. Not a fan cream of mushroom soup in general; so I didn't like it.Entree:Filet mignon with mushroom sauce in medium rare. All entrees came with mashed potato and broccoli. This was a disappointment. We asked for medium rare but it came out overcooked and not tender. It looked nothing like a filet mignon. The mashed potato is powder which we can taste the little grains of powder.New York Sirloin was cooked medium. This arrived more as medium rare which turned out to be not bad.Lobster ravioli was average and the sauce was creamy. It only came with 3 pieces of ravioli in a sea of cream sauce. The amount of pieces was not enough considering the price and amount of filling.Dessert:Cheesecake: It was light but not really creamy.Chocolate mousse cake: The crust was quite good.Tiramisu: Creamy but not a strong taste.",1,0,2,Fanny C.,"New York, NY",0,10,20
5.0,8/9/2017,"Came here last week during Restaurant Week and had an amazing dinner.  The service, food and the ambiance were all great. My companion and I both started with the cream of mushroom soup for appetizer.  I really enjoyed the soup; it wasn't too creamy and there was a robust mushroom flavor. For main, we both had the sirloin.  The steak comes with their signature sauce on the side.  The meat was great as was the sauce which I think was peppercorn based.  Nice and flavorful (both the meat and sauce). I wasn't too impressed with their dessert options so I had the ice cream.  My companion had the tiramisu which actually looked yummy and she really enjoyed it. The servers and maitre d' (owner?) were all very welcoming. Even though we partook in the ""cheaper"" dining option, we weren't made to feel like second class citizens unlike some other steakhouse establishment I visited the following week.  I've been looking for a solid steakhouse to take my dad to for dinner.

She was taking down my name to be seat when my party arrives but the manager mumble to her telling her not to take it and to do it when my party arrives... it was only 2 of us... anyway over looking that....Service...In my opinion, I think service is pretty bad for a higher end restaurant like this. The waiter was nice and all but he barely came by our table. We were there for over an hour and we did not get our water refilled once... meanwhile the waiters were refilling the water on the table next to us and around us.... the dishes were sloppy and we waited over 40 mins for our steak to come meanwhile the tables around us are already on dessert. When we were leaving the restaurant all the staff just ignored us and didn't even bother to acknowledge us. Not even our waiter said anything even tho our waiter looked at our bill and saw the generous tip my bf left him. The only one who did was the lady in the front. If I could I would rather give her all the tip. Food...The food was mediocre. The calamari was soggy and there was oil and crumbs all over the side of the plate. My steak only came with 2 broccoli... I looked over to the tables by us and their food looks a lot better. My cheesecake was frozen in the middle.. it was warm on the outside and cold in the center. I hope they did not microwave it....I am not sure why we received such bad service. We were not poorly dressed or looked like we did not have any money....

Our steaks and fish filet were BOTH delivered incorrectly, and the Manager blamed his staff saying ""he was supposed to offer you after dinner drinks on the house"".  That did not happen, as the waiter expressed nothing to us.

With cushions behind our back and a chandelier above our heads, the night was getting off to a good start. Food: We each ordered different appetizers but the highlight of them all was definitely the thick cut Canadian Bacon. To quote one of my friends who tried a piece, ""this is the best bacon I ever had!"" For entrees, everyone got the same thing: a medium-rare boneless rib eye. Best part- it was actually medium-rare. Some reviews complained about their steaks being cut too thin but we didn't have that problem. 3 out of the 4 of us ended up taking the steak home because it was too big to finish! For dessert, I highly highly recommend their Chocolate Mousse Cake. I'm not even a fan of chocolate mousse, but the crust on theirs was bomb. Service: Excellent service. Our waiter Genti was super attentive and really kind (esp when we were clueless to proper wine etiquette!) Even when Genti wasn't around different waiters came by to check on us - loved that!Overall, my girls and I had a great night at Empire Steak House!

2.0,2/6/2017,"**RESTAURANT WEEK WINTER 2017 REVIEW**Our party of 6 came in for Restaurant Week lunch for my Mom's birthday. She wanted some steak and originally suggested Empire's Midtown West location. But the Midtown East location had much better reviews so that's how we decided on this one.To start, most of us had the thick Canadian bacon. I was expecting a tiny, little piece but it was actually a full piece of bacon. However, it was about 80% fat, making it impossible to eat most of it. If you have a large group, I would recommend one or two of you getting this as the appetizer to share. One piece of bacon is way too much.For my entree, I went with the boneless rib-eye. I ordered it medium-rare and it came out medium to medium-well. The same thing happened to most people at my table. So keep in mind - order it one step rarer than you actually want, and then you'll probably get the steak the way you like it. The steak was also chewy, so I'm not sure if this was because of the doneness, or if the quality of the cut is just not that good.For dessert, I ordered the tiramisu. This wasn't bad (but I'm betting that might be because they didn't actually make it).We also ordered one of their RW bottles of wine, which was $40. That was a pretty good deal for a steakhouse so at least there was that. Maybe the quality when it's not RW is better - but then that's what I don't get.

2.0,2/4/2017,"Came for Restaurant Week lunch in Winter 2017, and was pretty disappointed. I got: -Canadian Bacon appetizer: still just as good as the first two times-Filet Mignon: decent, but nowhere near as good as it was during summer 2016 Restaurant Week; I feel like the cut of meat was significantly worse in quality this time around-Chocolate ice cream: this came out as literally just a ball of ice cream in a bowl. No frills or anything, which was surprising and pretty disappointingProbably won't be back for RW; I'd still come back for the regular menu, though (refer to my previous review, raving about the porterhouse for two experience). This would have been a three-star review, but I dinged a star for a pretty obvious decline in the quality of meat being used during RW, which seems wildly disrespectful to RW customers who may be using RW to test Empire out before coming back for a regular meal (and it also just seems like a bad business practice).",2,0,0,Lorelei Y.,"New York, NY",283,351,169
1.0,2/4/2017,"Came in for restaurant week without expectations and it was a massive disappointment.Calamari appetizer was weak. I had a NY Sirloin and she had a rib-eye. Rib-eye looked like they took a normal one and cut it into four the long way, it was the thinnest rib-eye steak i have ever seen. The NY sirloin was average, came out already cut and blatantly tasted like it was cooked with a stick of butter on each side.The entire time we were rushed. Asked four times if we were ready to place order, food comes out instantly, and check comes out rapidly without requesting it. They clearly want to move you out fast.After check we were finishing our bottle of wine and the main host came over to say ""looks like you need another bottle"" with a quarter of ours left...??

Peter Lugers does it better but this isn't bad at all. The portion we got seems smaller than what other people got based on their restaurant week pics.We got the boneless ribeye and the filet mignon. The ribeye was very thin and half of the steak was over cooked. I asked for medium rare but most of it was closer to well done. Regardless, the steak was still very tender and tasty so I didn't bother asking them to fix it. The filet mignon came in two thinner pieces than the usual single thick piece. I enjoyed this a lot because it was perfectly cooked throughout and very tender. I didn't care for their special steak sauce since it just tasted like a glorified ketchup with horseradish. For the desserts we chose the cheese cake and tiramisu. Both came with a scoop of whipped cream (homemade I assume).

Ended up being a bad decision, as the service was awkward and the food lackluster. The cheapest item (sizzling Canadian bacon extra thick) ended up being the best part of the meal here. We were seated and mentioned we'd arranged a change of the menu ahead of time (both via yelp message and note on our OT rez) and yet we were met with a flat ""no""...We insisted and the manager obliged*. During the bread course our larger untouched plates were whisked away, then our apps arrived (switched around in the sexist way of man gets the meat & woman gets the veg) and we received new plates. The creamed spinach was fine. The boneless (!) Rib eye was forgettable, as were the mashed and broccoli accompanying it. 3 sauce options were OK, good, and great. Filet mignon was was under the requested medium rare but we had the sense they wanted to get rid of us so we didn't bother mentioning, plus it was decent. The cheesecake arrived still frozen and pretty bland, and the chocolate mousse was the weakest ganache we've had; both came with a dollop of whipped cream very reminiscent of Cool Whip.Sizzling Canadian Bacon (Extra Thick) ($5.95 normally)Creamed Spinach ($10.95 normally, actually a side*)Boneless Rib Eye ($29.95 lunch only)Filet Mignon  ($27.95 if 8 oz w/ mashed&broccoli ; $48.95 dry aged)Cheesecake (only awkwardly named New York Cheesecake Chocolate on normal menu for $9.95)Chocolate Mousse Cake (not on normal menu)They seem to want to hide it on their site, but both locations are in a hotel, and we chose this one because it has better reviews and is in a better hotel chain (Kimberly rather than Hilton Garden Inn, & not open before lunch.*Just one app appealed to us, and it was the worst value by nearly $10, so ahead of time we confirmed with them OK to substitute side (normally $7 supp) for an appetizer (I'm sure they were glad because presumably cheaper..Yet we had this trouble)",2,1,1,George C.,"New York, NY",0,7747,14304

2.0,9/9/2016,"In the context of a relatively expensive restaurant, I've had significantly better.I went to Empire Steak House for Restaurant Week a few weeks ago, and I continue to be reminded of the experience due to a matchbook sitting on my desk at work.  So I finally decided to write my review.Do not - I repeat - Do NOT order a steak off of the RW menu.  While a ""steak house"" that typically charges between $50-$200 for a slab of meat would be expected to dish out deliciousness with their steaks, their RW steaks are a whole different story.  You'll notice a section of Grade A Prime Dry-Aged meat on the main menu, and you will notice that the menu for RW does not state ""Grade A,"" ""Prime,"" or ""Dry-Aged.""  I ordered the ""Boneless T-Bone"", which should have been my first clue.  It was insanely thin - I mean maybe 1/4"" if I am being generous.  It was grainy, it was not tender, and it was meh at best.  I ordered it Rare and it came Medium Rare, which is frankly to be expected with such a thin steak.  The chefs back there probably don't recall how to cook $2 Wal-Mart steaks anymore.The steak was seasoned fine, but the actual steak was borderline gross.  The side of mashed potatoes was delicious though, and I particularly enjoyed the appetizer as a single slice of slab bacon.  The dessert was also good, but I can't recall what I had.  Something with what tasted like an oreo cookie crust.Anyways, I have heard that serving up cheap steaks during RW is the MO for most of the steak places around town.  So it is not that Empire Steak House is doing anything different from other steak houses.  The problem is that it represents that you are getting an Empire Steak House steak, and what you are really getting is a cheap piece of meat.Guess whose business you lost permanently - this guy's.  I've had better steaks at Golden Corral (a buffet chain restaurant).",2,0,0,Christopher L.,"Boston, MA",116,4,0

3.0,8/15/2016,"**Review from restaurant week***I was really excited to try this after reading all the positive reviews and seeing a pretty decent RW menu.  As you walk into the restaurant, you'll an uninspiring bar and lounge area, however, if you continue to walk to the main dining room, you'll be blown away by the beauty of the space.  It had all the markings of an high-caliber steakhouse.....until you sit down and start ordering your food.All I can say is that the service......tried it's best.  The staff was clearly confused and frazzled even though we were the 3rd filled table.  It was painful putting in our orders, a pain having to remind them 3 times to remove our huge wine goblets from our table, it was a pain to ask for butter, and it was a pain to point to each other on our table as we had to remind them who got what.  Now on to the food.  Like I said, the menu looked decent so I should have known there was a catch.  When asking how big the steaks were, they said 14-16 oz for the ribeye and 12-14 oz  for the sirloin.  They were literally half that.  Not only that, the steaks were cut in half, like horizontally, so our steaks were literally like 1 cm thick.  You could not tell if you had the sirloin or ribeye - they all looked the same.  Backing up, the bacon was alright although the fat pieces were chewy, which is always never a good.The potatoes and broccoli were standard and the tiramisu was tasty.  Overall, it was a good meal......for the price of $29.  Despite the thickness of the steak, or lack thereof, the flavor was there.  But honestly, when the steak came out, it was kind of embarrassing.  It looked like a steak of Tad's, only smaller and thinner.  I'm not sure if I would try this place outside of RW....the service was sub-par and honestly, they lost some credibility as a steakhouse from what they did with the meat.",3,1,2,Douglas K.,"Queens, NY",145,562,1

3.0,8/15/2016,"***Review for Lunch RW Summer 2016 only****So let me start off, we went for lunch on a Sunday. I think that was our first mistake. We wanted an adult martini lunch in a sophisticated environment. Some of this was achieved, some not. We are foodies and are lucky enough to travel domestically and internationally to eat food from food trucks, steakhouses, homes, etc (anywhere there is good food). In saying that, I feel I need to be fair to this restaurant. Firstly, the environment and space is gorgeous. I can imagine, ""night"" as an optimal time for this establishment because unfortunately; lunch was everything BUT  ""adult and sophisticated."" Let me explain,NO Dress Code. Yea, if we were at a diner or casual eatery, this would be fine. But what this restaurant wants to exude in price and decor, a dress code should be enforced. No tank tops, shorts, or flipflops. There were so many people dressed for the ""beach"", it was a bit unexpected. Additionally, there were crying babies everywhere.To clarify, the babies were NOT sitting in a baby seat with the parents eating a nice meal. The babies were walking all over the establishment and under tables crawling, crying, and fussing. This is in-congruent with the steakhouse's decor, which exemplifies adult and refinement with the martini glasses, plush booths, and wine bottles lining the walls. When we were sitting there, we had a hard time enjoying the beautiful red wine with the crying babies, parents disciplining their children, and people listening to you-tube videos on speakerphone (yes this happened). And yes, most of these people were dressed for TGIF, not a $$$$ steakhouse. It cheapened the space. I know the restaurant cant pick the clientele, however, I think a few modifications, such as a dress code , would set a precedence to how individuals should act when out in an environment like this. We live in Brooklyn so we get casual. We get going to a restaurant in jeans. But for these prices and formal service, there was a disconnect. We looked around and sadly sat there a bit embarrassed. The management should go to Commanders Palace in New Orleans. It's a beautiful restaurant (very upscale at night) and have lunch hours for dining. STILL they enforce a casual dress for men and women and it works!! Individuals know when they walk in, what to expect. I am not saying a tux, but a shirt with a collar and no beach wear. And Commanders is less expensive than this place. But Commanders never loses the integrity of the space or menu. Service was great! Management and servers were very nice and accommodated as much as they could under the circumstances.Food: Cream Spinach: Yum!! Really tasty. Onion rolls with dipping oil: lovely starter and dipping oil was full of flavor. Thick slab of bacon: Better than Lugers! we were happy. Filet Mignon medallions: Ummm.... we did not get it. sliced filet mignon?? huh? we should have ordered something else. Desserts: Wonderful carrot cake. Delicious.Wine: We had a great bottle of Pinot Noir from Oregon. Light and gorgeous. (I could have used a Xanax with the wine to deal with all the crying babies. LOL)We learned a lesson: No more RW Lunch for us. This was not a special experience. We could have done steaks and wine for less, near our apt in Williamsburg and had more refined adult fun.Nevertheless, this restaurant is a sexy space, so I bet at night it has a better feel....... and the kiddies are all in bed. ;)",0,0,0,D O.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,153,7

For entree we all had filet mignon. It was phenomenal. The mashed potatoes were very very tasty. The sauces they give for the steak and potatoes were delicious!!!

Overall, nice ambience!Service was actually quite good as well.  I actually felt a little bad bc there were times when our party may have been a little abrupt, but they never let it phase them. Dishes came out promptly and in great timing!  They were very polite with clearing plates and our glasses were filled regularly.  The entire time, I felt that they provided us with great service and care!The restaurant week menu was pretty legit!  Lots of options! There were six of us, and most of us ordered essentially the same stuff : Tomato and Mozzarella or Calamari for apps, and the Filet Mignon or Boneless Ribeye for our entree.  Dessert varied a bit more with Cheesecake, Chocolate Mousse, Carrot Cake, and Tiramisu.My meal : Calamari - good amount for myself.  I actually gave some away bc I didn't want to be too full for the rest of dinner.  The breading wasn't so light that it was barely covering the squid, but also not so heavy that I felt like my arteries were going to clog.  It was also nice to not have the breading overpower the squid.  Nice balance! Boneless Ribeye - cooked perfectly!  If you like a fattier steak, I would choose this one.  As expected, the fat was really flavorful!  I wish that the meat itself were a bit more flavorful, as I ended up adding a bit of salt and using some sauce (I'm a huge advocate for steaks that don't need any modifications).  The potatoes were a bit grainy for my preference, and definitely needed some salt.  The dish also came with broccoli for anyone that like it, but I'm not big on greens.  However, it was still a good dish overall! Cheesecake - wonderful on presentation!  I'd say it was moderate in density and amount of flavor.  While the amount of flavor wasn't jam packed, the flavor itself was still spot on.  The Tomato and Mozzarella came with ginormous super saturated red tomato slices, so for someone that likes tomatoes a lot, this is probably a nice choice.  The cheese was really good =)I had a bite of the Filet, which was just how it should be. Incredibly tender!  Flavor was pretty okay, although I'm not sure that I would want to eat it for my entire entree just bc I like the fattier cuts.The Chocolate Mousse was nice and velvety, but the best part was the cookie crust!All in all, pretty good place!  It seems like everyone enjoyed their dishes and had happy bellies.  Glad it was restaurant week bc it was more affordable!  Worth a try, especially for such a good deal.",3,0,0,Amelia A.,"New York, NY",296,167,576

1.0,7/13/2016,"UPDATE:  I want to post a BEWARE warning to customers at Empire Steak House. When I was in NY a few weeks ago, I used my Chase CC 1 time. It was here at Empire for a very expensive meal. I hadn't used it in a long time and not since (didn't want to use my debit card). Wouldn't you know, someone in NY has been using this card. I just got a call today from Chase. This person went to a DD in Brooklyn, bought almost $1000 at TJMaxx in Brooklyn, booked airfare and more. I'm so pissed. I'm not made of money, but I splurged on what I thought would be an elegant meal for my husband and 2 children. One of Empire Steak Houses employees STOLE from me. I was in NY on a business trip (working as in having a job to pay for my own meals) and brought my family along to experience NYC. Yet, some scumbag Empire employee thought he or she would get a nice ride off of me. Congrats you piece of trash. You worked the system, and you broke my heart. I never thought a nice place like Empire Steak House would have such seedy employees, but it does. Next time I will choose a place more reputable.",5,0,0,Alissa G.,"Hopkinton, MA",15,32,4

The porterhouse for 2 was huge and so very good!!! You need to try the mushrooms...mouth watering. This place is the place for steaks. HIGHLY recommend",1,0,0,Colton W.,"Manhattan, NY",0,4,1
2.0,6/4/2016,So much more left to be desired. We ordered off the main steak menu and were suprised with the cuts. We ordered bone in rib eye and were brought a sirloin type steak (no bone). We asked our waiter and he assured us it was what we ordered when visibly it was not. We would have appreciated a bit more courtesy with our observation but none was offered. We frequent the other Steakhouses nearby and know the difference between the cuts. A lower cost for the cuts may have justified the quality of meat but they are as expensive as more reputable Steakhouses.,1,0,0,Juan Emilio R.,"New York, NY",0,1,0

5.0,4/25/2016,"One of my favorite steakhouses is Ben & Jack's Steakhouse who are the same owners as Empire Steakhouse. Years ago, I use to regularly frequent Ben & Jack's at their location on 45th Street before they had closed. On most every visit, Jack, one of the owners, would greet us at the door and shake our hands. Decided to try Empire this past Saturday as my cousin and his friend were visiting from out of town. The decor and overall ambiance of Empire was a bit more upscale than other steakhouses but without the any attitude you might find at certain upscale restaurants. Anyway, the server had recommended the Emperor's steak for two and the Ribeye steak for the 3 of us, which we all shared. The steaks wet cooked a perfect medium rare as ordered and the meat was tender and juicy. We also had the Empire salad, sautéed mushrooms and spinach. With each course, a team of 4 or five servers would serve each of us which was very nice but meant I didn't have an opportunity to take pictures of the food. Anyway, about midway through our dinner, I had asked our server if Jack was working that night, and he said Jack had just arrived a short while ago. A few minutes later Jack came by our table to say hello and comped us a round of drinks! A very generous and unexpected surprise. Overall, I can't say I have anything I could possibly complain about. The food and service were impeccable. Would highly recommend Empire Steakhouse to everyone!!! It will be well worth the experience!",5,0,0,Mike L.,"FOREST HILLS, NY",8,74,68

4.0,4/15/2016,"I went for lunch here with a colleague recently. Although it was surprisingly quiet for a Friday afternoon, we really enjoyed our meal. The room decor is beautiful--very old school New York. The staff were attentive and constantly checked on us, without being overbearing. The food was excellent, from salad to dessert. Not the best steak I have had in the city, but very enjoyable nevertheless. Their home steak sauce, which the host had hyped when we arrived, complemented the meat well. Indeed, we found the prix fixe to be a great value.",0,0,0,David Z.,"Manhattan, NY",0,3,0
1.0,4/2/2016,Disappointed. Steak was poorly cooked and tasteless (despite being their signature 'Empire' Steak). Even the side dishes weren't great. Salads were better and restaurant itself was pretty nice.,0,0,0,Nick R.,"Bronx, NY",7,3,0
4.0,3/10/2016,"Flavor: 9We tried two cuts: the tomahawk rib eye, and the ""Emperor's cut,"" which is a T-bone steak from the rear portion of the animal that has a much larger tenderloin side. I'm not quite sure how this is different than a porterhouse, unless what they offer as a porterhouse is more accurately described as a T-bone, which generally has a smaller tenderloin side.As you can see above, it looks a bit overcooked. With such a large hunk of beef, that is always a concern. Pair that with the hot plate presentation and some graying of meat is bound to happen. Much of the cut was fine, however, and the large tenderloin was very flavorful. The sirloin side was a little tougher, but this was a welcome texture change from the super soft tenderloin side. Flavors were very meaty, there was a great sear on the outside with a good crust, and the steak was well seasoned. In any case, I've decided to also include this cut on my porterhouse page even though it is also on the ""other cuts"" page as a T-bone. I feel like some diners may expect this was a porterhouse. I do, however, think the price tag on it is a bit hefty when compared to their porterhouse for two. I'm curious about the porterhouse and why it is so much cheaper that this cut. Is the porterhouse on the menu actually a T-Bone, which would mean that the emperor cut is actually the true porterhouse? 8/10.The tomahawk rib eye was by far the better steak at 9/10. There was a good amount of funk to it, likely from the aging process, and it was cooked perfectly to the specified medium rare. The fat cap was a good size too, as you can see from the up-turned slice below. There is almost an equal portion of eye as there is cap.Choice of Cuts & Quality Available: 10All of the major cuts are prime and/or dry aged. The quality here is definitely a cut above (knee-slap). There are many sizes of porterhouse, multiple versions of the rib steak, several filets and even some off-cuts like the T-bone. In addition they offer A5 grade Kobe Wagyu filet and rib eye, imported from Japan.Portion Size & Plating: 8Portions here are all fairly large, and plating is simple, without too much flourish. For some items, however, they do make a solid attempt at beauty. The seafood platter, for example, is gorgeous (see below). And all plates were cleaned and wiped of any splash before coming out to the table.Price: 9Menu prices seem to be pretty good. There are some items that are very fairly priced, like a porterhouse for two for $96. I think the tomahawk steak ($65), and the emperor's steak for two ($120) are a bit steep, but there are other alternatives. For example, if you want a rib eye you can choose the regular bone-in at $49, which is under the average price point for midtown steak joints. The porterhouse might be a cheaper alternative to the emperor's steak, but, like I said above, if you're all about the tenderloin, then that emperor's cut might make more sense. The cool thing here is that you are getting great quality for that price either way.Bar: 8The bar area is pretty nice. It's not huge, but it makes the best of the space, with street-side high tops and large door-sized windows that open out to the sidewalk. The bar has a good selection of single malts as well, and they make a good martini.Specials and Other Meats: 8There were no specials read to us, but this place does offer a fair amount of alternative meats, like lamb, veal and chicken. I didn't notice any pork other than our bacon app. We tried the rack of lamb. This shit rivaled the beef. It was super flavorful, really well seasoned and perfectly cooked.Apps, Sides & Desserts: 7I'll just fire these off quick. First the seafood platter. I was a little bummed that there were no clams, oysters or mussels. Also, the lobster was completely flavorless, as were the shrimp. That was probably the only thing lacking in this meal, and that's what is dragging down the score here. But the lump crab meat was absolutely delicious. No lack of flavor there. Also, it was beautiful when it came out to the table.As you can see we also tried the Canadian bacon. This was great. I highly recommend this when you come here, as there are very few other bacon apps that are quite as good. Pictured below is just a half of one slice (we ordered two slices to share among four people).We also tried the creamed spinach and truffle mac & cheese. Both were excellent. In fact I was wishing I wasn't so full on meat, because I wanted more of that mac & cheese!Last, we also had some onion rings. These were lightly battered on the outside, tender on the inside, and lightly seasoned. We all liked them a lot.For dessert, we shared an apple strudel and a slice of chocolate mousse cake. Both were amazing. The chocolate mousse cake was light and fluffy, not overly sweet, and had a really nice or... REVIEW CUT FOR LENGTH",5,0,0,JohnnyPrimeC. C.,"Manhattan, NY",199,213,4300
5.0,2/27/2016,"Walked in w my manager for lunch this Friday.  We didn't have reservations but they gladly welcomed us.  It was seriously quiet with only a handful of tables.  But  the decoration is amazing. The  high ceiling with beautiful chandelier and they had a private dining area as well inside a wine  cellar /vault.   The complementary olive oil and bread was delicious.  We both ordered the French onion soup as my manager had dined there the week before and recommended it. It was one of the best I've had.  I had the boneless rib eye. The portion is perfect for lunch and absolutely well seasoned and tasty!   I was too stuffed and  to try any dessert, but I shall return to try!  The service was so  friendly and attentive!  smiles from beginning to end.One detail to women, the ladies room is dimly lit and the stalls are not deep to stand inside and close the door comfortably.  Thank god I'm petite , but I can't imagine woman larger than me. And, the toilet paper was one ply, but they afforded soft  thick hand towels. To me  that just doesn't make sense.",3,3,0,Macy T.,"Tarrytown, NY",37,177,145

5.0,2/21/2016,"We came here for a Valentines day dinner. I must say the food was great. We had the dry aged porter house steak for 2. Sides of truffle mac and cheese, and mashed potatoes. And we started with the baked clams. We had so many servers come to our table. They did not leave us alone, all they wanted to do was serve us, which was wonderful, but i also have two hands. Being a foodie made this experience very difficult because they kept trying to serve me while I'm explaining that I need pictures before I eat. I know that this is the restaurants culture but you must accommodate me and my needs. I hope to return.",1,2,1,Chabeli D.,"Manhattan, NY",35,35,653
5.0,2/14/2016,"Recently opened, and the space has been redone from its prior incarnation. They've done a great job. It is modern yet very cozy. And it's a fairly large space, with high ceilings in the main dining area. We started with the heartland salad, which includes their excellent, crisp, bacon and luscious blue cheese dressing. The stuffed mushrooms were fantastic, filled with crab meat. And the oysters were great as well. For steaks we had the porterhouse for two, medium rare, and medium plus filet mignon. The steaks were perfectly prepared, sizzling, and very tasty. I'd definitely rank them among the best, if not the best, in the city as of this writing. Creamed spinach was good. Fried onion rings were awesome. We ordered a fish dish, and unfortunately I forget which (not salmon) and this, I though was more mediocre. However we also prefer a couple of pasta dishes for kids, and they were great (marinara and vodka sauce). For dessert, we had an excellent by cheesecake. The lava cake was more mediocre as the outer portion of the cake was not very moist. The service was excellent. If you are a steak fan, you must check Empire on the east side out.",2,0,1,Rick S.,"New York, NY",5,187,18
3.0,2/9/2016,"Mid-level steakhouse that replaced an awful Mediterranean spot.  Steaks and sides are serviceable but cost the same as the best steakhouses in NY so not sure why you would seek this place out.  Slice of carrot cake for dessert was paper thin, wine pours frugal - definitely didn't have the indulgent feel of an expensive steak dinner.  Still early for this place though and the space is swank so there is hope for improvement.",1,0,1,Catfish H.,"Manhattan, NY",0,247,114
