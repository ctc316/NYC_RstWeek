3.0,3/20/2019,"I was disappointed. Not what I was expecting and I had been a patron before the new ownership. I can tell you what was not in the captioned dish, sausage and the small piece of fish was over cooked. Nice decor. Pleasant waiter though he didn't know much about the menu. Perhaps the new owner should feed the waiters and explain each dish. Oh, by the way, I didn't appreciate the host lying to me when asked if we could sit away from the only other diners in the restaurant at the time.

4.0,3/9/2019,"I'm going to give it 4 stars because the service was really good. Also because the seafood is wild caught.  I wasn't crazy about the menu.  All the waitstaff picked up our empty plates almost immediately and asked if everything was ok.  They removed our water glasses immediately when we said we weren't having water.  When we went over to Minton's, one of the staff members picked up my coat for me and took it to the coat check without being asked. He then brought back a coat check ticket. When I went to get my coat, the coat check person put my coat on for me.  The bartender in Minton's was attentive.  Everyone received a great tip. With that being said, the greatest letdown of all is that the menu is SO excruciatingly basic.  I'm talking basically basic with basic sauce on top.Sigh.  But service was amazing!!",1,1,0,Miss C.,"New York, NY",3,55,0

I accidentally left my wallet behind and the manager and hostess immediately got in touch to see how they could return my left behind belonging.

1.0,1/29/2019,"On Saturday, January 26 I went to The Cecil to celebrate my 27th birthday. I was very excited after all the lovely things I heard about this restaurant regarding the food, ambiance, entertainment and host of other ""great"" things. My party and I arrived at The Cecil about 10 minutes prior to our reservation and the hostess seemed very excited that my party was now smaller, expressing that we would be seated within the next few minutes. A few minutes passed and after asking what the hassle was with our seating, the hostess told us the party prior to us were paying their bill and we would be seated soon. To our surprise after a trip to the restroom, we discovered the party actually was eating their dessert. A few minutes turned into an hour of waiting to be seated.After finally being seated, we had a waiter who was not very personable. He seemed to be there to do a job and that was it. The waiter had not been around to refill water, ask if we wanted additional drinks or to let us know what the hassle was with the appetizers we ordered and waited more than 30 minutes for after taking our order. The night remained frustrating as we began to receive incorrect entrees and room temperature meals. It was also heartbreaking to watch a party across from us enjoy their celebrated guest's birthday dinner while my party and I sat there in frustration because of the lack of diligence to correct the issues we were having. The waiter was aware that it was my birthday and didn't seem as if he cared to do anything to cater to this, regardless of us expressing the issues we were having with the lack of hospitality.The unexpected time spent at The Cecil prevented other birthday activities I had planned.

1.0,1/27/2019,"I went to Cecil last night for a family member's birthday dinner and it was beyond disappointing. Our party of 7 arrived 10 minutes before our reservation time and weren't seated for an hour. During that time we weren't given the opportunity to order drinks or pre-order dinner to expedite the process once we were seated.Upon being seated, it took close to an hour for drinks to arrive. 5 people received hot appetizers, leaving 2 waiting on salads for 30 minutes. Water and drinks were not refreshed. I brought my concerns to the manager and was ushered to my seat with the promise of resolving the issues. I wished this was helpful as several entrees were wrong and delayed as well. It was frustrating to see other large parties around us being served promptly, leaving us to assume the problems were a result of our server. The apology was lackluster and food was not worth the wait. This event ate up time in our celebration and impacted the other activities we had planned for the evening.

The staff went above and beyond to make sure we were well taken care of. Since we were a large party the food was served family style but everything was very well prepared, from the empanadas and salad to the steak, chicken and fish. Dessert felt a tiny bit rushed and a little light but we had to make the 930 show over at Minton's so that was understandable...The staff also made our reservations for the show and shepherded us there.

On our dessert time, they left the same utensils used for our main course.When the dessert came the dessert spoon came but our steak utensils still in our table.Here's my thing, its considerably a fine dining restaurant and changing utensils each meal is part of the service.Please change utensils every meal ( NY meals $150-$250 )",0,0,0,Rho M.,"Chicago, IL",6,1,0

Just to have an idea we had a table for 8pm and they rushed us so bad that we were out from the restaurant a little before 9pm having had 3 courses for what they charged $150 + tax + tips per person. The starter were amazing but we could not enjoy it properly because half way thru our starter food runners put my fatty piece of Bone Prime Rib (that in the menu said it was 24oz but it was 12oz max if you included the roasted potatoes).From there onwards the whole experience  just went just down hill.The steak was just meh and fatty, besides it did not have any bone in...The mushrooms were so sour that I had to leave them in the plate. The roast potatoes were okay but who can manage to ruin roast potatoes?The desert very mediocre and they probably cut the strawberries with the same knife they cut the onions as they tasted like onions.The ambiance was nice and vibrant, waiter friendly but the food was disappointing; over all the whole experience was mediocre and didn't deserve our $200 a piece for less than one hour.I don't recommend visiting the place in festive days.I hope the restaurant's owner reads this review and considers a better service for the next festive celebration.",3,0,0,Luiz S.,"Manhattan, NY",44,1,4

He is a ""steak lover"" so I figured you can't go wrong since it's a steakhouse.  First, I will say the scenery is beautiful.  Moving on to the service - when I was seated, no one came to greet us. I asked one of the waiters can we kindly request service and he said ""oh, I'll take your order"" as if he helping out.  Then the steak came and my husband had to send it back. It was stringy, not quality meat and not well seasoned.  My husband said it was literally one of the worst steaks he has had in a long time.

There is a bar in the front that had a number of people and past it the main space which is very trendy, modern, and spacious. I also noticed they have a piano where I imagine they usually have live music.We tried a number of drinks from the menu, my favorite was the blackberry gimlet. For food, we of course had to try the steaks so we went for the filet mignon and the NY strip steak. We were both very pleased with our choices, and they also came with small sides that were pretty good.

The table next to us came in after us had appetizers and ate their entrées before we even ordered our entrées.  Luckily the event planner Rosa was amazing she came over she may show our drinks with good she may show our orders were good and we got our food. My boyfriend order to New York strip with spinach and roasted potatoes and I ordered the porterhouse steak with roasted cauliflower(delicious). The steaks were supposed to be medium well with no blood or my boyfriend state came back to the table bleeding so we sent it back when it came back his spinach was over seasoned and the steak was beyond well done so we wound up having it taken off the bill and we shared my porterhouse steak and my veggies. Rosa even made sure to bring my boyfriend a piece a cake for his birthday and they play the birthday song and he absolutely loved it and enjoyed it. we definitely will be going back again for dinner again I cannot re-iterate that Rosa made everything much more pleasant after having to deal with a stupid waiter and I thank her very much for making the rest of our night very enjoyable.",0,0,0,Tonya T.,"Laurelton, Queens, NY",62,7,18

It is a very nice looking space. I started with a drink the call Date Night for my cocktail.  It was just ok. Not the tasty cocktail I was hoping for. The food was just average. Nothing spectacular about my lobster ravioli with shrimp and scallops. It was very underwhelming in flavor and taste. The portion size was also very small. I literally had 4 raviolis and three shrimp. That's TINY for the $24 price tag. Also the waiter dubbed it as his favorite dish and it was very mediocre, so I was surprised at that. Lastly it was just warm & warm food is never ok. It should be hot. I didn't bother telling the waiter about it, so that could have been remedied. I went out with 11 classmates, so they added 20% gratuity. I hate when they do that, but oh well. Over all I would return, but probably just for drinks.",0,0,0,Mickei M.,"BOWLING GREEN, NY",1,136,271

Then you move into the main dining room and the art on the walls and rest of the decor will take your breath away. There was also live jazz music which was initially a plus, but quickly became annoying. I went to Cecil for brunch with a group of friends. We had no issues getting a table (this should have been a red flag). The waiter, although not very versed on the menu was super pleasant and eager to help. They offer a bottomless mimosa deal for $25 (no entree required). I ordered shrimp in a a white wine sauce. While tasty, I wasn't quite satisfied (or full). It was served with a pesto quinoa, but was surprisingly really good. If ordering, I would suggest detailing the shrimp and mixing the entire dish together. Much better that way. Another dish ordered was the steak and eggs. Which was underwhelming as well. The eggs were, and you can quote me, ""the most boring eggs I've ever tasted.""  The crab cake was decent, a lot of breading, but had flavor.

I enjoyed the sangria it wasn't the best I've had but it left me feeling buzzed. My mother didn't really like her cocktail she said it reminded her of sangria. As an appetizer we ordered the shrimp empanadas. They were very small and only came with 2 so we each took one. There were barely any shrimps in there but the sauce they served with it was really good. For brunch entrees I ordered the chicken and waffles. Although the presentation was nice, the chicken was over cooked and dry, the waffles were good. My mom ordered the avocado toast with steak. She ordered her steak medium and it came out well done. Aside from that she enjoyed her dish. For brunch I give them a 3/5. There were no bottomless options.

Instead of being called back by a manager, I called again a couple hours before the reservation and was told that the gift certificate would not be honored. The most they could offer for a two-meal gift certificate was that our reservation would be ""noted"" and that we would receive ""a couple appetizers"" to make up for the loss.

We were promised a speaker so we could play our own music, but when it didn't work, they just agreed to play ours throughout the entire restaurant! We had a preset 3 course meal for us to chose from. I had salad, sautéed shrimp, T-Bone steak, and cheesecake. The shrimp was very good and came with quinoa which was okay. I couldn't believe how big the steak was. I don't typically get steak at restaurants because I feel like you only get a small piece, but they did not disappoint here! There's so many good restaurants in NYC so I wouldn't necessarily make it a priority to go back when I visit, but I'd recommend it to people in the area.",1,0,0,Nicole W.,"Columbia, SC",171,120,132
4.0,6/16/2018,"Coming in and entering the bar area, I was the 1st of a group to dine for Saturday brunch. They had the World cup soccer game playing so it took my attention for a while. We were also greeted by Rosa who was very welcoming.  It's only when we were all there and they sat us down is when I met our server Awilda. She is such an asset here. She is the epitome of customer centric service. She is friendly already and she knows the menu very well. She made both the suggestions for drinks and food. Both were on point. She is ready to please the customers of this establishment.  Even though she had several tables, she was consistently on top of her tables. She constantly checks in to make sure everything is going well. The other guy is from Senegal, I think he said Antoni. Even while I was waiting at the bar area, he was engaging and friendly. He also was paying attention to the tables making sure things were cleared.  It was truly a nice experience and definitely thanks to Awilda for her dedication to the restaurant.",0,0,0,Claude W.,"SPRINGFIELD GARDENS, NY",121,208,1737
2.0,6/16/2018,"We arrived at 7:45 for 8pm reservation for 8 people celebrating mom's birthday. We were told that they were waiting for table to clear and that the patrons were not wrapping up fast enough. At approximately 8:30 we were told it was the kitchen that was backed up so patrons were just getting to order dessert so the manager offered to buy us a round of cocktails for our patience. At approximately 9pm as drinks arrived, the table was ready. We ordered food; at approximately 9:20 bread provided; we were hungry but kept our spirits up. At around 10:15pm we asked waitress for update on the food; she said she would check. The food arrived at approximately 10:40 pm; good but smaller portions than expected. We definitely would have ordered appetizers if we knew the portions would be so small and that our wait would be so long.After food delivered, we never saw our waitress again. When we asked another waiter for her, he told us she had been at work since 7am (6 people called out) so she's probably ""dead"" somewhere, but he'd check and find her. We told him we gave her a cake and we were ready for it. At approximately 11:20  yet another waiter came and told us that Jennifer left for the night and that he would be our server.  He was nice enough but we were ready to get the cake and go. Long story short when he came out with the cake it was already sliced up and on plates!! My daughter bought a large and beautiful strawberry cheesecake which my mother did not get to see. We were distraught. Even worse, her ""slice"" was  mush. It wa as if someone scooped it out with a spoon! We were in shock, especially because earlier in the evening we witnessed the staff bring out another table's beautiful, intact cake with candles and about 8 singing staff members. We received none of that! As you can imagine it was a disaster. And after 20 minutes of back and forth with the waiter and manager our bill was drastically reduced.  This was not an easy feat since initially the manager wanted us to pay now and promised when we ""returned"" we would get free cocktails and a discounted meal.  Our group assured him that as beautiful as the venue is, returning was simply not happening.  Further, the final waiter, who's only role was to bring out the cake, INSISTED that we provide him with a tip. This, even after we shared the horrors of our evening topped off with his ultimate destruction of a very beautiful birthday cake. In the back of my mind I believe that either the cake, which had been stored in the restaurant's refrigerator, had either been cut by someone in advance and our waiter tried to cover it up, or he decided to cut it to expedite getting us out the door. In either case, it was a very wrong decision.This venue seriously suffers from poor management and lack of sufficient staffing. Again, all those people attempted to be kind but the wait for food, missed reservation and poor staffing just could not be overlooked. From beginning to end it was a complete disappointment. The one upside is that the food was tasty and the venue was visually appealing but that all goes out the window when the service is terrible.

Drinks are poorly made and expensive. My utensils were dirty. I ordered chicken and waffles as a main course. When my food finally arrived, presentation was clearly not important. I expected to receive a full Belgian waffle with some nice, juicy, flavorful pieces of chicken. Instead I got two COLD to the touch pieces of the waffles and two bite size pieces of bland chicken which was also not hot. The biggest turn off of the day was our waiter. She left without notifying someone else to take care of our party. Very unprofessional. Overall I was pretty displeased about this restaurant.

The wait staff was so helpful and enthusiastic about birthdays (there were multiple bdays that Sunday) they have a live band playing music as you eat and for every birthday song they would randomly play 50 cent it's your bday which was sooo funny to me. Now onto the food so I ordered the chicken and waffles which surprisingly for southern cuisine wasn't all that good :( butttt the food ordered by the rest of my table was delicious! The lamb chops were so tasty you want to eat the bone. I also have to comment on the uniqueness of the brunch menu. I've never heard of some of the flavor combinations that the Cecil offered.

3.0,4/15/2018,"I am giving this place a 3 stars because of the service. How shall I start. First, I want to say that the food is great. I was not disappointed when it came to the food. I loved what I ordered. I ordered shrimp empanadas as my appetizer and the pan seared salmon as my entree. My negative review is more about the service, and the ambiance. The place felt super packed and that is because at the entrance, there's a small lounge that could fit probably 50 people. I went there on a Saturday night. I don't know if it's different any other days. I didn't like the fact that the lounge was right by the entrance. My fiancé and I had to walk through the lounge in order to get to the dining area. I don't mind it, I just think that the lounge area shouldn't be there. The owner could've perhaps placed it in the back. When I first walked in to inquire about making reservations, I saw people in flip flops. In other words, this is not a place where you need to get really dressed up for, although, some people were dressed up including myself. The lounge and dinner area are separate, however, there's no door that really separates them so the music that they're playing in the lounge can be heard in the dining area as well which I also don't mind.The lounge section was mostly by the bar which meant that it took a long time for us to get our drinks. Our drinks came at the same time as our entrees. The server kept telling us that he was having problems putting the order for the drinks because it was so packed around the bar. The manager ended up taking the drinks off our bill but that was a huge turn off for me because I like to receive my drink first, then, my appetizer, and finally, my entree and maybe order a second drink by the time my entree comes but that wasn't the case that night. Instead of two entrees coming out, we received one. My fiancé sat there for 5 mns waiting for his food to come out. When it finally came out, he had ordered sweet potato fries as a side and it never came until he brought it up to our server's attention who told him that they had to redo it. The fries came out shortly after but that wasn't supposed to be told to the customer and instead of bringing on part of the meal out, wait until the whole meal is complete and then bring it out. I wouldn't really recommend this steakhouse.",1,0,0,Christelle L.,"Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",0,6,3
2.0,4/5/2018,POOR QUALITY MEAT - definitely not USDA prime or even select. For the price point I would have expected a better quality streak. I had a Ribeye and it was tough with tons of gristle.

But I created this page just to do so because of the horrible experience I had yesterday on what was supposed to be an amazing Easter Brunch. I was really excited to bring my friends from out of town to this restaurant. I've been here so many times I've never received such bad service. First we were put all the way in the back room which seemed like punishment of some sort but it was busy so it was fine I'm not unreasonable. Then our waitress was extremely rude. Haily i believe her name was. She was very short, impatient, and aggressive... Firstly she was flirting with other customers instead of attending her tables then the second time I inquired about our meal being extremely delayed her response was ""I'm not the cook. And it's honestly not my fucking problem. If you'd like you can go elsewhere."" I was appalled and embarrassed to receive such treatment at a place I'd been boasting about to my friends. Then I overheard her huffing and puffing about another table as well and complaining saying out loud that the manager did not know how to do her job or manage her staff. Guests should not be overhearing these type of comments mid-meals. People like her should not be waiting on guests.

1.0,3/18/2018,I came here for my friends birthday she made reservations...her and I arrived first and we already knew that we would have to wait for the rest of the party to be sat. The decor was very nice I loved the big piano in front .as our party arrived we went to the host and told her we were ready to be sat the host told us we would have to wait because it was really busy and they needed a table which was hard to understand because we had reservations the table should of already been available. The wait was a hour and finally we were greeted by a man he was really nice and he sat us and provided us with menus which we found out later on in the night that he was the owner. The menus are beautiful the table was beautiful. Now again we are waiting .we see servers passing our table several times and nobody is greeting us .by now we are starving we already waited a hour just to be sat now we are waiting again .so finally we get a hold of one of the servers and we ask him can we get water he asked us if we wanted  sparkling or tap but he was rushing us and we never got a chance to answer so another staff member came with tap water and just poured it in our cups ..then the guy asked us has anybody came to the table we said no so we asked him can he take our order and as he proceeded to take it a female came to the table which ended up being our original server and she started taking our order .so I asked her can we keep the guy as our server and she told me it wasn't allowed that we can't switch servers which is untrue because I was a server you can switch and also request a server. We got our drinks in a timely manner and they were very good .now we wait for appetizers which took a hour and our server came to the table after a hour to tell us there is no more chicken for the empanadas so my friend changes it to salad than a hour later the server comes with chicken empanadas after she said it wasn't any chicken .i ordered beef empanadas and one was beef and the other one I couldn't identify and I told the server I hope it wasn't shrimp inside because I am allergic it's really a dark restaurant so we had to use our phones as light to look at the food .she looked at my plate and just gave me a unsure look she told me she didn't know what it was and took it back never asked me if I wanted it redone or anything .now we wait another hour for our food .the food was good but wasn't worth the wait or price .finally it's time to sing happy birthday to my friend we asked if we can play a special song on the radio because they had a laptop controlling the music but they never played it for her then the server came with the cupcakes that we brought and they were messy as if they fell and she said that the boss said they couldn't light the candles because it would set off the fire sprinklers .then the server asked my friend did she want a drink as if it was on the house but it ended up on our bill .this was the most horrible dining experience I've ever had and i feel even worse for my friend because she was celebrating her birthday not only was she sad but it was humiliating because we her friends were unsatisfied and now grumpy and no longer in the party mood .i really hope they work on their service and prepare better for busy nights and occasions,2,0,0,Sunny S.,"Manhattan, NY",0,3,0

We put our drink orders in and then the wait began. We waited and waited. Finally at last, our drinks came. Mines was good but was missing alcohol. Nonetheless we waited for our appetizers and just a few minutes before some of our plates came out, they informed one of the guests in our party they ran out of the appetizer that she ordered. Strike one. At last our the appetizers came out. The salad was ok. Just ok. We were seated at 9pm and at 11:30 some of our dishes came out. When everything came out I was pleased even though the wait was ridiculously long. I will admit, the food was good but the wait was a turn off so our party couldn't really enjoy the meal. We asked to speak to the manager and he never came to speak to us. We were promised a free round of drinks to make up for the bad service which was the least they could do.

My first impression was that the restaurant was very intimate and romantic. The music that played was a nice 90s/00s R&B mix,  very chill. The host and wait staff were all very pleasant and came around with perfect timing, not too frequently and not sparsely. For my 3 course meal I chose the vegetable empanadas, the pan seared salmon, and the tres leches cake. I ordered a bottle of sparkling water ($8) and a Corona to drink with my meal.The empanadas (2 of them) were delicious and served with a portion of salad in the middle. The star of the evening, the salmon with grilled shrimp & asparagus, came to the table still steaming. It was absolutely delicious and very flavorful.

1.0,12/2/2017,"Five stars for food -- one star for ambiance.   Thus one star overall. Let me explain. On a Saturday night four of us shared the clams casino (perfect) and shrimp scampi appetizer (tasty) and portions were good. We asked for bread for sopping up all the delicious juices- it did not appear until they cleared the dishes. Then we shared porterhouse for two and prime rib for two with sides creamed spinach and mashed potatoes. The meats were really terrific and sides both excellent.Now to the problem. The problem was the outrageous noise level. The front part of restaurant is an attractive bar- noise level there acceptable. The main restaurant however was under the spell of a strange DJ who thought he was in some kind of disco time warp. He had headsets on and tortured us diners by blasting old school music at way way over the top (into painful range) level. The high ceiling and acoustics of room was such that the result was that everyone at EVERY table had to literally scream at table mates to converse. What's with that???? Three times we told waitstaff music was too loud- three times mad DJ lowered it for one minute and then raised it even louder!! It was a freaking nightmare. Our ears were literally hurting when we left- Now, two hours later and at home, my hearing feels like I'm underwater- my ears are probably damaged.

What needs work: communication. We asked for bread three times and after complaining we learned that they don't have bread. Some items were supposed to be served with sweet potatoes and we had mashed potatoes. Yeah still a potatoes but we made our decision based upon which entree had sweet potatoes.",4,0,0,Laurisha C.,"New York, NY",68,195,0
5.0,11/12/2017,"I came here after a long flight on my way home to NJ and OMH WHAT A GREAT DECISION IT WAS!I ordered the filet - it's been a while since I had a steak and side dishes I didn't have to season at all - no salt & pepper, nothing. WOWThen after smashing  down my steak (that I initially thought was too much for me when I ordered) my friend offered me to the her Lobster Ravioli - and I wished I had more room in my stomach because I wanted to order that was probably the best I've ever had. Needless to say, I will be here again and again.Can't wait!!",3,0,0,Toy M.,"Washington, DC",15,3,0
5.0,11/5/2017,"Amazing experience. Was here during it's reopening and recently visited again. Did not fail to impress me once again. From the ambiance to their excellent set menus, it all came together to give us an amazing experience. Started with their signature sautéed shrimp appetizer, which from what I recall had a great tone and balance with it's wine and garlic touches. For the main course I stayed with a medium rare Filet Mignon, cooked to my exact liking. I added a few greens to my order that the waitress was able to suggest a great paring with the side order of garlic spinach.This dining experience was one wish I would duplicate myself at home, but I can't, so it's the reason why I am heading back. To endulge in the atmosphere and food, while knowing Cecil's chef and staff will do it 10 times better. Looking forward to my next visit, which I'll include photographic proof of this amazing establishment and experience.",0,0,0,Zeuxi D.,"Concourse, Bronx, NY",13,6,8
