5.0,4/25/2019,"Fourth or so time coming here when in manhattan because it's perfectly located by penn station.  From hostess to waiter service was perfect.  Crab cake was excellent...cream spinach, and Mac n cheese were perfect. The filet mignon was cooked perfectly(rare). Meal was a solid 10 of 10...kids were happy...Boston Lager was ice cold. Expensive but worth it.",0,0,0,Lorne K.,"Wantagh, NY",1,24,6
1.0,4/12/2019,Very disappointed on Thursday evening. We brought head of a major Chinese firm to Nick and Stef's at Penn. Lobster Bisque was awful and cool. Their bluepoint oysters were tiny. One ordered the lamb chops medium rare came out well. He decided not to send it back .The porterhouse for two was overly tough..Just a bad night for us there and really did not want to write this but embarrassing dinner for guests.

5.0,3/18/2019,"Excellent dinner. Review will include highlights and things to note. Service/First ImpressionsApp to make reservation took seconds and emails to confirm etc.  Easy. Post Big East Tourney. Reservation got us seated in under 2 minutes. Great location and easy to find Dinner Excellent service.  Attentive waiter who was friendly and explained the menu to all.  Some first timers in party of 4. Very impressed by managers clearing dishes and making sure you are happy.  Actively working the room.  Good menu with solid apps, steaks, drinks and dessert NYC steak and prices- nothing shocking Bread- very good and different kinds.  Was hot. Apps.  Caesar salad, calamari, lobster bisque, etc. all were very good.  No complaints. 4 Filets.  All cooked to perfection.   Sides-   Mac and cheese, truffle fries, potatoes. All hot and very good.  Drinks Scotch and Beer.   Generous pours on scotches however they also not charging $8.   This NYC however, it was a 2 ounce pour or pretty close.    Lagavulin 16 too.  Ahh what a great scotch. Dessert Cheesecake for table.  It was exceptional. If I had to complain, these would be my only comments.  Mind you this would in no way impact my return. And yes that is a no brainerBathroom is smaller than my 1/2 bathroom at home. With a packed bar and drinks flowing, don't wait.  Seating is tight.   I get it and not something I care about however I was bumped into many times by patrons and passing employees.In conclusion, a great steak, great dinner and a place I would be happy to eat at again.  I would recommend to family in friends when they visit the city.",1,0,0,Rich G.,"Shelton, CT",0,19,0

3.0,1/21/2019,"We went to Nick & Stef's this past Saturday, before the Sebastian Maniscalco performance at the garden. I arrived 15 minutes before my dining companion. I grabbed a seat at the bar which was about 3/4 full with the hopes of grabbing a drink. I sat for about 5 minutes (which may not sound like a long time-But it Felt Like it) waiting to be acknowledged.The bartender finally approached...the two women next to me and gave them a bunch of menus-he then left the area. I pulled out my phone to kill some time-5 more minutes-still no service. I know this is a bar full of tourists and what not but that's not excusable. Tourists deserve Respect and alcohol too. And I'm not a tourist btw...The service: table service was very good. And although dessert was forgotten/not brought to the table-the waiterApologized and comped it. We thought that was great. The food: we both had the petit filet mignon-I know-not the most flavorful but I loved it. Juicy and tender. I had the peppercorn sauce (don't usually use sauce on meat) and it was the right amount of spice. The brussel sprouts w/ bacon were pretty good, but needed a little more flavor, imo. I didn't care for the Mac and cheese-I thought it was bland-companion really liked it. I guess I'm a Mac and cheese snob. The chocolate  With gelato was not good at all. Please Skip!

Did the pre-fix menu - Salad for the appetizer, NY strip, and chocolate cake.Pro: it was empty - Ambience was chill.Con: The steak was overcooked and I was too hungry to complain. The quality of the meat was not good at all. The dessert was like a frozen ice cream cake, and I've definitely had better at Carvel.Meal for two (pre-fix) came out to $160 pre-tip that included one glass of wine.

3.0,9/24/2018,"Went to the Paul Simon Concert at Madison Square Garden the other night met a friend at 6:30 pm for the 8pm show. They served us promptly they seem very seasoned in getting people in and out for show time. A great plus is they have a DIRECT ENTRANCE into The Garden from the restaurant so you don't have to hike to 7th Avenue. We dined al fresco which was lovely. We had the calamari which was perfect, tender and lightly breaded which was delicious. I found the crab cocktail to be a little water logged as if it was sitting around in an ice water bucket too long. The crab cake was lovely and moist but very spicy which i think should have been indicated on the menu. The baked clams were good more of a clams casino than whole baked clams not what i expected but good.. The truffle french fries were first served cold we had to return them to get heated and when they came back they were perfect you could taste the truffle oil and they were seasoned to perfection. The drinks were ample.This is a steakhouse and the offerings for the toppings on the steaks were interesting and delicious. Great side order options. Quite pricey but it is a Steakhouse in a tourist area so that is to be expected. Make sure you have a reservation because it can get packed. The service was great the food was average.",0,0,0,Veronica O.,"Manhattan, NY",324,31,2
3.0,7/2/2018,"This is actually 3 1/2 but I didn't feel it warranted rounding up. We had dinner here before going to see Sam Smith at MSG. I sat at the bar waiting for my husband to arrive and had a Dark and Stormy. It was a little on the sweet side until I squeezed the lime that garnished it. I feel like the lime should have been part of the drink...at least that's how I've always had it.For my meal I ordered the petite filet with the peppercorn sauce and a side of the crispy potatoes. The steak was cooked perfectly, was sufficiently tender, and tasted good (I always try it without the sauce first). The potatoes were underwhelming. A little on the dry side and resembled something I would get at a diner, not a nice steak house in Manhattan. My hubby had a Cesar salad with sliced steak on top and he really enjoyed. For dessert I had the chocolate cake. It was very moist and had good chocolate flavor. It was served with a tiny scoop of vanilla gelato and it was yummy. My hubby had the strawberry cheesecake and he really enjoyed it. I would have liked a little more cream cheese flavor. The service was decent. Our waiter was a little on the dry/salty side but by no means unfriendly or bad. Just a slightly cranky NYC steak house waiter.Overall the meal was good but not anything overwhelmingly spectacular.

The product, a filet mignon was as good as any I have had. My drink , a tequila based margarita was terrific. The service was professional and pleasant. Maybe it shouldn't matter, but I was pleased that I had "" room"" to eat. How can this place not be packed? Is it because it is connected to MSG? Not enough history? For me, great product, wonderful service, and peace on a Friday night. Well, the secret is out but so what? If they keep this going the public will figure it out.

Boyfriend got the rib steak with mushroom sauce and I got the filet mignon with some white sauce that I forgot the name. We didn't order anything else but the steaks. The server was nice in the beginning but he sounded very demeaning when we didn't order drinks or sides. I mean, I came here for steaks, who cares about anything else plus they are overcharged. Anyway the steaks were cooked exactly like how we wanted. Steak isn't my favorite food but it actually tasted good.

The food came out in such a quick manner especially for how packed they were! All dishes were delicious although the salmon was a little bland for our tastebuds. All of our favorites happened to be the dish I got which were the crab cakes with corn salad and chipotle aioli. The crab cakes were stuffed with more crab than any other seaside place I've been to.

3.0,3/26/2018,"To be quite honest, I have always seen this place but never thought to give it a try because I was convinced it probably only appeared to concert goers or tourists. And that was exactly just it. The vibe was weird because you can't really tell if it's suppose to be a casual or upscale environment. I was hoping more upscale but that fell short. Walked in no one greeted us. We asked if our clients had arrived they weren't sure. 10 minutes later they realized they already sat them down. Moving forward -- the food was bland nothing special.

Yet we watched tables around us get served first and almost finish eating before we were done with our meal.The food is utterly a ripoff... The best thing about the meal was the short rib risotto but it was heavy as an appetizer and a bit salty. Everything else was simply poor.

3.0,2/7/2018,"Came here 6pm on a Thursday night with my bf. That was the peak time when everyone was dinning before the Rangers game at MSG. The place was so packed and loud that you couldn't hear your own thoughts. Definitely not the best ambiance for romantic dates, because you won't be able to hear each other even if you shout across the table. The tables were squished together so tightly, we were practically having a group dinner with the other couples sitting on either side of us. Almost everyone around us was dressed in Rangers regalia, so we looked a bit out of place in our formal dinner clothes. When planning a night out, definitely take into consideration whether MSG events are happening and dress/prepare accordingly. Around 7pm, when everyone left for the game, the place became deserted. That's when it became possible to relax in the dim lighting and enjoy the conversation. Definitely visit during that time. The service was great, very courteous, attentive, but not intrusive. The menu is definitely overpriced. We got jumbo crab cakes for appetizers, for $19 per portion. One, small crab cake with a bit of cabbage slaw on the side. The crab cake was deliciously juicy, with rich tartar sauce on the side. Recommend trying despite the price. For the main course, we got the surf and turf, crab stuffed shrimp, and sweet potato fries. Surf and turn comes without a side, and for $64, the portion is pretty small. But the lobster tail and filler mignon cut were delicious, no arguing there. The crab stuffed shrimp came on a bed of spinach and white sauce. Pretty small portion. Definitely could've used more sauce. The five shrimps stuffed with crab meat were tiny--not jumbo shrimp or even slightly larger than average sized shrimps. Five shrimps are definitely not worth $49, so just consider your budget and how hungry you are when visiting. The fries were delicious, but then it's hard to mess up sweet potatoes. Overall, a good experience, but you can definitely find better at a much more reasonable price in the area.",0,0,0,Kseniya K.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",223,112,526

The location is fantastic for something like that, and the restaurant ambiance is nice.  It was busy of course, but not too loud.  The waitress was nice and helpful, but the food was just not that great.  It was good, but a little high priced.  For the cost of it, I was not impressed.  I also thought it interesting that twice different staff members tried to grab my wife's mixed drink and get her another.  She wasn't completely done with it, and rather than seeming helpful, I took it as if they were just trying to push another drink on us, which of course would have driven the overall bill up.  No problem with us having more than one drink with dinner, but we should be asked; it should not just be assumed so they can add cost to our dining.  For the location, I'd recommend it if you're going to a show at MSG.  But if you are just looking for a good place to eat, try somewhere else.",0,0,0,Tim M.,"Fredericksburg, VA",0,6,0

Four of us came before a Knick's game and had a few drinks and a bit of food.... not entire meals because we knew we were going to eat at the game. I had a Caprese Salad which was fresh and tasty, but a bit on the small side (two slices each of tomato and mozzarella cheese). One friend had French onion soup (which was judged as just okay) and another had lobster bisque which was abandoned after a couple of bites. Next, the four of us shared the Porterhouse for Two which was huge and sliced perfectly.... but rather fatty and not all the flavorful. A good third was left behind (and four of us shared something that was made for two). We ordered sautéed spinach and French fries to share..... and again neither was all that remarkable, with the spinach being the better choice.Come, if you want, for the convenience.

I had the braised short rib that was accompanied by the mashed potatoes and root vegetables. The short ribs were succulent and tender. The meat was falling off the bone. The mashed potatoes were rich and creamy. The root vegetables were prepared well and were rich in flavor. The short ribs were served with a rich au jus sauce. The food was delectable!

3.0,11/10/2017,"Three of us dined here. I'd walked past it thousands of times but never been in. As friends had trains to catch location made sense next to Penn Station. The food was fine in that it was piping hot but really I wouldn't eat here again simply because its overpriced. I'm not sure if that's because they may have to pay a percentage to Madison Square Gardens like airport shops usually have to or simply because they can.  For the price charged there are so many other places in NY.The waiter asked if we'd like the salad chopped, yes we said, it came unchopped. I ordered the grilled salmon assuming at $35 just for the salmon it would be a whole salmon, not a fillet. When I got back home and was chatting with the doorman about my evening, he said that place its not even wild salmon at that price they use farmed salmon. The fried crispy potato which the waiter said is like hash browns I assumed would be several pieces not one large one. Again nice and piping hot but very oily. The bread basket only had two types of bread and one of them was rock hard, at the prices charged would expect to be warm and fresh. Finally like so many expensive places the waiter rushed to clear away instead of waiting for us all to finish and clear in one go. Clearly staff training in service needs to be invested in. Still the only place in NYC where I've noticed the service is correct is Le Cirque by the Bloomberg Building.The total bill was well over $200 for three fish main courses, 2 sides, 2 salads and 2 bottles of water. So it was ok as a quiet night there but on a busy night can imagine could be a 2 star experience. Plus portions of sides, salad and main course could have been more generous. For example there were three of us trying to divide two pieces of mozzarella and two slices of tomato, in an Italian place in Howard Beach they made it three pieces of cheese and slice of tomato which was sensible.",0,0,0,Victor A.,"New York, NY",40,227,26
2.0,10/28/2017,"I went last night before the Knicks game and found it to be thoroughly, thoroughly mediocre. Except the prime location for Madison Square Garden, there wasnt much great about it. What I didnt like...1) Service was a bit light. Seemed like they tried to do the bare minimum2) Waiter brought out our appetizer at the same time as our soup and salad...no bueno3) I ordered my ribeye ""charred rare"" and it came out without a single visible area of char anywhere. Its almost like they purposely tried to not char it. Seriously!4) Steak was thoroughly under seasoned so I had to add salt to it which is something I havent had to do in years. Having to add salt to a $66 steak. Not cool. Not cool at all.Overall disappointing experience. Generally Im pretty bullish on Patina Group places but this one was pretty disappointing.

However, I would love to give a five star to the waiter who served me well and being really nice to me since I come to the restaurant by myself.

1.0,10/4/2017,Nick & Stefs might be the worst steakhouse in NYC.  Lets begin with the fact that the waiter asked us if we wanted to order wine or cocktails and neglected to bring us a wine or cocktail menu.  After having to ask him for the menu he began to rattle off the evening specials even though nobody was paying attention to him as we were looking at what bottle of wine to order.  I actually interrupted him and told him to please come back in a few minutes so that we can look at the wine menu.  We were there for a birthday dinner and felt completely rushed even though the restaurant was relatively empty.Now lets get to the food.  I ordered the tuna tartar and this may have been the best thing i ate all night.  The tuna was relatively fresh.  My fiance ordered the caprese salad.  They brought out over-sized slices of tomatoes that have seen better days and the mozzarella was not fresh.  It was definitely sitting in the fridge for days and became hard and had no taste. We then ordered the porter house for two.  The steak came out cold and was sitting over a pool of oil.  I wanted to ask them for a new plate so that the steak wouldn't be so oily. of course when we would pick up the pieces of steak some oil splashed on our shirts.  The steak had zero taste. I mean zero. Absolutely no flavor. Needed to salt it myself.  No self respecting steakhouse has this issue.  The creamed spinach we ordered was cold and overly soupy with again no flavor.  The asparagus also had a pool of oil underneath it and again had no flavor.  Ordered the key lime pie for dessert and yes you guessed it no flavor. This place is not worth the money.  we would have been happier at an outback steakhouse.  The food and service are better there.,0,0,0,Jake H.,"Upper East Side, Manhattan, NY",0,1,0

I didn't get a single piece that had actual meat on it. Just kept eating fat piece after fat piece hoping I would bite into bacon goodness. With our filet mignon (which was cooked perfectly to order) we got sautéed mushrooms which were shredded and disgusting and my mom said they've never come out that way before with very few actual whole mushrooms. The mushroom sauce was amazing but I didn't care for the peppercorn or blue cheese ones, probably personal preference. Spinach was ok. Server was sweet.

The appetizers were great especially the soup ordered the lump crab for an appetizer and it was in incredible our waiter suggested it and I have to say it was great. Once the main course came we quickly realized why it was a price fixed menu the steak was something frozen you would buy from Omaha steaks. They were dry and tasteless the potions were a lot bigger than we expected but the quality and texture were similar to what you can get at Applebee's.

3.0,2/21/2017,The food here is hit and miss. The steaks are pretty good. Nice char and seasoned right and steaks good flavor. The sides though we're so so. The Hash browns was lightly cooked on the outside and the inside was a mushy flavorless potatoes. It was definitely not the usual crispy outside you get for hash browns. The Brussels sprouts were ok but also under seasoned. For desert the cobbler was ok. It was nothing special. The scoop of vanilla ice cream was tasty though.The tables here here tight with 2 1/2 inch space between each. It's pretty much communal dining. As we were escorted to our table by the hostess my lady friend who was sitting inside needed the table to be slid out so she could squeeze into her seat. I had to slide the table out. I was a little amazed that the hostess which he was male stood by idly watching me. It was only when I struggled with sliding the table back in place that he helped me. Never for a god restaurant I've had to  move a table myself. Usually that is done by the hostess. The restaurant is also very noisy. So definitely not a place for quiet conversation. The verdict is there are plenty of better steak places in town so it's ok to skip Nick and Stef's.

She dropped the menus and walked away, we didn't see her for maybe 10-15 minutes after sitting down. I ordered a glass of wine and that took another 10 minutes and not surprised she dissapeared again. When we finally saw her she quickly said the special in which we had to ask her to repeat them because we couldn't understand since she was speaking so fast. Finally after eating the bread basket because it took forever to get our steaks someone showed up with our food, again no waitress which was fine. We ate our meal and she never asked if we needed anything else, which at that point we just wanted to eat, pay and leave. So then as we finally pay the poor manger who was such a sweetheart very gently explained she had  swiped my credit card twice.

Push a table that was 2 inches away from another table - to a distance that was possible to maneuver around).   I spent most of my dinner wondering how On earth I'd get out of that space.  Would a server help move the table out?  (Hint:  answer was no).   Or would I have to crawl under the table?  Lol - seems silly but it was bad.,0,0,0,Ellen W.,"Fishers, IN",20,56,18

3.0,10/14/2016,"Ok, not sure how I want to start this review. The dining experience was fun given the company I was with. I'm assuming the crowd was light that evening because there was no game next door (@MSG) and it was a holiday. Both answers doesn't bode well either way. What surprised me was the lack of creativity in the presentation of the food and plating. I'm giving this place three stars just because the menu offerings available, the service I received, and that they cooked the Porterhouse exactly the temperature I like - medium rare. The filet side was tender, smooth, and went down like butter. The steak was a favorite at the table. However, they failed to create the steakhouse experience with other things.  First step in through the door, surprisingly the hostess was dressed so casual. Didn't go with the ambiance and the visual you'd expect of a nice steak house. Moving on, if you see the pics I've attached you'd see why I'm a little perturbed about my food. The slab of bacon appetizer looked better than it was. There was so much more fat on it than meat. The sear on it was beautiful so you can imagine my dismay when half of it was fatty and chewy - not easily edible. The lobster cocktail was a little light. I'll give them credit for it being cooked right, was not overdone. However, portion size not worth the money. It was skimpy. Then our Porterhouse for two, as noted before, while cooked the way we asked - did you see how much oil was under it? It was juicy enough on its own! I'm going to assume that greasy mess under it was butter, steak juices, and some kind of oil. It was not adding anything to this dish except a glistening oil slick. Very not necessary. And the wrong color for effect. Lastly, the desserts. We ordered the mango sorbet and Key Lime Pie to share. As the waiter suggested, the graham cracker crust was what made the Key Lime pie so popular. It was not overly sour and was quite good. They lost points on the plating. The top was white and so was the plate. Where's the pretty garnish? Mint leaf? Drizzle of something on the plate or around it for looks? Even a wedge of lime or candied something would have made it more impressive. It's a nice dessert, give it some love. The mango sorbet same problem,  scoop was not generous. It was sad. Tasted great but looked so skimpy in the glass. And again no garnish. Luckily it was my birthday so they stuck a candle in it for me.  Sheesh. I had high hopes for this place.

Since I had a big night planned at another steak house the following day, I decided to opt out of beef and order pork.I felt like our service was a bit lackluster. It was 6 pm so it wasn't terribly early. I felt a bit forgotten at times.My pork chop was completely disappointing. The restaurant I frequent the most in my area has two versions of chops that are 100 times better. I'm not exaggerating. They have spoiled me to tender, juicy chops. The one I received at Nick and Stef's was dry and boring. My friend even commented that ""it looked dry."" She was right. You'd think that for the money spent on this dish, they could get it right.Now here's the kicker: my friend was treating and she attempted to pay with a cc that had a chip. Instead of informing her that their machine doesn't accept that kind of card, she was told ""there is something wrong with the card."" This was VERY awkward. After a bit of wrangling, calls to her husband to come in with another card (he was picking us up), the front desk finally admitted that they couldn't accept cards with chips yet. They COULD take her number down manually. Wow. How can you be so close to a location that hosts MAJOR events, and not accept chip cards?

A full bar is toward the right and dining room is to the left.  It has the feel of an upscale restaurant, but mixed clientele.  There is not really a formal dress code, but a t-shirt and sneakers is allowed.Pricing:  The bar is reasonably priced for being right next to Madison Square Garden.  A full bar is available, with plenty of seating.  The restaurant is also well-priced, but expect steakhouse pricing.Conclusion:  To me, this location is more of a tourist trap.  If you are looking for a legitimate steak house, go to Keens or The Homestead (Downtown.)  Even though it was a pleasant experience, I couldn't give any more then 3 stars to an average steakhouse in NYC.",0,0,0,Mike W.,"Newfoundland, NJ",58,46,37
1.0,9/15/2015,I went here before a Broadway show tonight straight off the train from Penn Station. My fiancée and I ordered the tomato and mozzarella which was good but small portion and needed more drizzle on top. For the main course we ordered the Porter House Steak for 2 and Sweet Potato Fries. The steak was inedible fatty and had no taste and the sweet potato fries were soggy. We couldn't send the steak back since we were trying to make a show. My fiancée wanted to wrap the steak up and give it to a homeless person and I said no it's not good enough for them! Pissed. What a waste of money.,2,0,0,Deborah B.,"Roslyn Heights, NY",0,29,10
4.0,8/6/2015,Food. Great. Restaurant week so it's always a tad downplayed but I ordered the lobster and it was pretty darn good. 2 clams. Half a small lobster but really enough. Some small potatoes and half a corn. All good though. Appetizer was tasty. Fried calamari with salad. I'm allergic to carrots and good thing I asked for none. While none were listed there were carrots. So would have had to send them back. Dessert was ok. Peach cobbler. Should have been crispier I top. Main complaint you wonder?My trip to the bathroom. Ok. So when someone opened my door I may have responded a bit sarcastically. They were not apologetic. But after that they used a phrase I won't repeat here. What I could kiss actually. The fun went on. Even when I tried to smooth things over when I got out they had none of it. Loved going to a nice place and being threatened in the bathroom. While this isn't the Norm it happened. Just saying. It is upsetting but wasn't the restaurants fault. But still.,0,0,0,Debra N.,"Garden City, NY",9,26,0
2.0,8/3/2015,"This review is for Summer Restaurant Week 2015. This was, quite honestly, an awful steakhouse experience. We chose to come here because the options on the preset menu looked good and the restaurant has an entrance straight to Madison Square Garden so it seemed like a convenient place to meet up with some friends working in NYC. Unfortunately, the food was terrible. We started off with the fried calamari salad and the lobster risotto appetizers. The salad was unimpressive, a few pieces of unappealing looking calamari over lettuce, little to no flavor. The lobster risotto was actually the best part of the meal, but overly heavy, it was again nothing special. For our entree we both got the NY Strip Steak ordered rare plus. The steaks came out and were obviously overdone, the temperature I would've expected from a steak ordered medium well. They were almost inedible. Lastly, we ordered the peach cobbler for dessert. By that point we were so turned off by our meal we weren't really sure what to expect. There was no surprise here, the cobbler was so sweet it was unpalatable and the crust was so dry, it was like eating sawdust. Needless to say, I will not be returning.",2,0,1,Gujri S.,"Pittsburgh, PA",12,12,2
4.0,8/2/2015,"My wife and I recently went into Nick and Stef's Steakhouse before the U2 concert on Friday night.  The restaurant is really close and convenient to MSG.  We were seated at a table along the wall really close to other customers and I was pretty upset at where we ended up but without reservations there was nothing we could do.  The food and service though was excellent.  I ate the dry aged New York and my wife had the branzino sea bass because she doesn't like steak or red meat.  We were really happy that there are a lot of seafood options to choose from.  They also had a really good red wine by the glass selection.  I had 3 cabernet's to choose from and our waitress (Jessica) was very knowledgeable and was able to describe each cabernet in detail.  She helped us select one from Sonoma that went perfectly with our meal selections.  She was also knowledgeable about the menu and suggested the grilled whole branzino which my wife and I never had before.  It was delicious and served with green beans.  It was amazing and the steak was cooked perfectly.  Because we didn't make reservations, we ended up sitting on top of the other patrons, but ultimately the food, and the service made up for the bad seats.  We will be back again for the Branzino and steaks.",1,0,0,Joe B.,"Wethersfield, CT",0,2,0

Good for us because it was quick & we had good service BUT bad because if it's good why isn't it busy? Can never please us New Yorkers haha. For apps, I had the Summer Roll - Shrimp, Mango, Green Papaya with a Lime Chili sauce & he had the Barbecue Short Rib with Polenta & Grilled Peaches = both were delicious & the presentation was artful. For lunch, we both had the Hanger Steak with Chimichurri & Yucca Fries = the steak was cooked medium rare just like I ordered it, the Chimichurri added spice & flavor (I usually only like my steak cooked with salt & pepper. I'm a firm believer if it's a good cut of meat it doesn't need much. The simplicity of a well prepared protein is all you need). The Yucca Fries instead of the traditional french fry I really enjoyed & appreciated their creativity. For dessert we both had the Dark Chocolate Ganache with Raspberry Sea Salt sauce = this was my favorite part of the meal. The cake melts in your mouth.

2.0,7/23/2015,"I have been to Nick and Stef's a few times, and each time I have been underwhelmed. The restaurant is nice, the service is pretty good, but the food is just not NYC steakhouse quality. I compare everything to Luger's, the gold standard in my honest opinion for steak. We ordered the porterhouse for two, and it had a lot of fat, in fact I'd say it was 20-25% fat, very disappointing to say the least. I know that people say fat=flavor, but solid blocks of fat in a steak =less steak for me to eat...Besides the fat, the steak was underseasoned and lacked that meaty taste you expect, it was just bland. I ordered a side of Bernaise sauce and it tasted kind of ""old"" and bland as well. The only highlight were the sides, we had the french fries and the roasted mushrooms both of which were good, but not good enough for me to return just for them.If you are heading to MSG and want to grab a quick steak before a show, I would stop in, just don't expect anything mind blowing.",4,2,2,Paul B.,"Port Washington, NY",122,219,52

4.0,3/7/2015,"I went with a friend for lunch during Restaurant Week. It was empty, but then again it was 2pm and snowing pretty hardcore outside. I imagine that during peak hours, it's packed here given its prime location right next to the Penn Station entrance and the Garden. I got the arugula salad and the hanger steak. The salad came with apples and pecans; it felt like it was missing something like cheese or cranberries, but otherwise, it was light and enjoyable. Steak wasn't the best steak I've had but it was tasty and filled me up. It was sliced up and came with potatoes. My friend got the gnocchi and steak salad and she said they were both great. Dessert was the true winner of the night, so much so that it gets its own paragraph. I got the cheesecake and it was arguably the best cheesecake I've ever had. On the menu, it said that it came with raspberry drizzle, but it didn't have any when it was served. I didn't mind at all! My friend, however, got the bread pudding and it. was. incredible. Warm, gooey, salted caramel chocolatey. It was absolutely one of the best desserts I've ever had in my 25 years of life. Service was great - our waiter asked us too many times ""how is everything?""

The sides where average with the creamed spinach being the best. The pecan pie was BAD not fresh and might have been frozen at one time. The thing I found most appalling was the bathroom. It was the dirtiest steakhouse bathroom I have ever seen. How can you claim to be upscale when your bathroom looks like its part of a crappy gas station.

You will obviously eat better at Nick & Stef's than a 2-star diner, or 2-star pub.The expectation was that this would be on par with the better steakhouses in NYC. The cost certainly was: $380 for three people covered 2 appetizers, 2 rib eyes, 1 strip, 2 sides, 1 bottle of wine ($90), 3 coffees and no dessert.The fried calamari was excellent, with a delicious  tomato dipping sauce.  The baked clams, though, were a disaster. Dry as a bone, rubbery clam and no flavor.The steaks were cooked as ordered and tasty -- but -- you should never have to reach for salt and pepper. They just needed to be a little more aggressively seasoned. Or maybe the beef itself wasn't as assertive as we all like. They do come with a choice of 8 sauces and we liked ours very much (two had the peppercorn and one the red wine Bordelaise). They helped kick up the steaks a little.The mashed potatoes again were terribly under-seasoned, needing cream, butter and salt! The mac n cheese was OK, but just not the gooey, cheesy delight it should be (the noodles were in a watery cheese sauce, not sticking to the noodles).The hostess, bartender, waitress and busboys were all friendly and attentive.

4.0,9/2/2013,"I've had some really exceptional meals at Nick & Stef's. For the food alone, I would give it five stars, but I agree with others about the location. It's not the best, and the restaurant itself is a little on the dark & stuffy side. But the food, drinks and service make up for that small shortcoming. I visit once a year around my birthday because I receive this awesome gift certificate from Simply Patina (for the past 13 years!) to be used at any of their restaurants. I've tried their others, but Nick & Stef's is easily my favorite.I'll just talk about the last time I was there, because it was absolutely perfect. I ordered an aged NY Strip. This was the embodiment of a steak as I dream about it being. Perfectly seared, perfectly rare inside, perfect seasoning. With red wine bordelaise, I'm in my happy place. My boyfriend ordered the herb roasted chicken, which was, again, flawless. For sides we ordered potato gratin and brussel sprouts with lardons. The potatoes were inhaled in record-time. Oh my god. I want those potatoes right now. The brussel sprouts were compulsively edible, with the perfect hint of balsamic and crispy lardons blowing me away with every bite.The glass of red I had with my dinner hit the spot (they have a truly great wine selection) and for dessert we shared crème brulèe, which went perfectly with a glass of scotch on the rocks. (Nick & Stef's is just that type of place.)I wholeheartedly recommend this place to anyone who doesn't mind walking past a little scaffolding in order to get to a truly quality establishment.",1,1,0,Maria C.,"Forest Hills, NY",108,151,0

5.0,4/1/2013,"Love this place and given the fact that a steak house pops up every minute in this MSG neighborhood- it takes soemthing special to stand out.  N&S delivers- the food is always top notch (by food I mean steak and lobster- to the nay-sayers on here ordering chicken I say, you may be right- if you want chicken- Popeye's is across the street).The steaks are always perfectly prepared and nicely seasoned.  The sides range from tried and tru like creamed spinach and mashed potatoes to a delicious au gratin!  I have NEVER been charged for a sauce (not sure the person on here who mentions that was looking at the bill correctly).  The wine list has a lot of reasonable choices in addition to a few high end, special-occasion bottles.Service, which is huge, is always friendly and professional.  They can move you through a delightful dining experience in time for the game or you can linger and take some more time- they never rush you but will help you set a pace depending on your activities!Salads are always fresh and the calamari and crab cocktail are delicious.  Staked against the locals- Keens, Desmonds, Uncle Jacks- I give this place the top ranking.  And if you are headed there pre-game, they are the clsoest with a private entrance into the Garden allowing you to skip the masses at the ticket entrance!",0,0,0,Jenn R.,"New York, NY",33,12,0

1.0,2/18/2011,"I'd be remiss if I didn't share with my fellow Yelpers my experience dining at Nick & Stef's, as I'd love to be able to save someone else from wasting their money. Took the hubby out for a ""surprise"" date night here. Based on the website homepage screaming ""2009 Wine Spectator Restaurant Award Winner!"" and ""Voted ""one of the Top 10 best steakhouses in New York City,"" (by who? People missing their tongues?) I thought, how could I go wrong? And when I checked out their decent looking Restaurant Week menu I decided it was worth the try.I make pretty good decisions most of the time. This, however, was not one of them. We arrived on time for our rezzie, and while we were promptly seated by the hostess, nobody offered to take our coats (in a $$$ steakhouse? Really?) so we had to take them off at our booth and stuff them in the seat next to us. Okay, I know I might be nitpicking here, but details matter. (Speaking of details, the place could really use a facelift - it looks like a 24-hour casino restaurant in there.) Then we each ordered a glass of wine - at $12 a pop. My Healdsburg Cab came out in a tiny glass more suited for schnapps than red, and the wine was dripping all over the glass, on the stem, on the base..now on the tablecloth...it wasn't pretty. I used my napkin to wipe it up, and tried my damnedest to remain positive. We ordered from the Resto Week menu - maybe a mistake as well - I'm starting to believe the whole restaurant week thing is a total sham...restos probably give their ""good"" chefs vacation that week and bring in any old peon to handle the knives back there. First came our iceberg wedges, which sort of looked like sad little things I would have created in my kitchen with the remains of a Bacon Bits jar and an almost-defunct head of iceberg. Nothing about it said ""top ten steakhouse."" This was not boding well. Next up came entrees - I ordered the steak frites, and hubby ordered the petit filet WITH the half lobster (extra $9). First of all, when they say ""half lobster"" they aren't messing around. This was the tiniest, preemie, baby lobster I've ever seen, and they literally sliced the poor guy lengthwise and half of it sat sadly on hubby's plate. ONE EYE staring up at him. The lobster meat was tough, overcooked and was just not even worth eating based on how depressing the presentation was. His filet was cold, as if it had been cooked hours ago and just left to sit in the kitchen. My plate looked like something McDonald's would have come up with if they decided to start serving steak. The fries looked (and tasted) just like McD's. The plate looked like a kiddie plate...no garnishes, no extra touches, no herbs even to dust the edge and make it at least ""appear"" like some effort had been put in to plating. NOTHING. My steak was so tough I couldn't eat it.One redeemer: the waiter felt terrible (rightfully so) and brought us over the regular dining menu to order dessert off of. We stuck with gelato (how can you go wrong there), and he also brought my husband a scotch, gratis. When the bill came they had taken off $35 for one our meals. The bill was still $100, but they did the right thing in the end, considering.

4.0,12/14/2010,"I really don't know why it wasn't more crowded. Why would you eat anywhere else when you are seeing something at Madison Square Garden? Situated inside the Garden itself, with an entrance on 33rd street, you couldn't be closer to the arena. And what's better than filling up on a hearty steak dinner before gulping down beers at a live concert or sporting event? We took client's here before taking them to a concert, and it was the perfect venue. We had some great cured meats at the bar and the friendly and attentive bartenders were prompt with the drinks until we were seated. They had a large table set up in the middle of the dining room for 12 people. Somehow it was perfect and oddly enough, felt private. Everyone ordered appetizers, I ordered the tuna tartar, which was pretty good, a little on the average side, but done well and the fish was very fresh. For dinner I had lamb chops. They were decent, not the best lamb chops I have ever had (Frankie and Johnnies & The Palm are better!) but I was still happy with them. The sides were adequate, not bad by any means, but not good in biblical proportions either. Here is their biggest problem - they only have one server for our entire table. It made ordering slow, refilling drinks slow and getting hot food on the table take ions. When it's a large party like that, you need more manpower. That's just science. I have to say the best part of this restaurant is the location. You just cannot beat it. And the food is client-worthy, which is a plus. I would recommend it for people who are seeing something in the Garden only, not as a destination dinner. Here is the best part: They have their own secret entrance to MSG. No waiting on lines, no fighting with the masses, you just exit through the restaurant and walk up two flights of stairs and BAM: enter Madison Square Garden in all its glory, and you are standing in the middle of it.

4.0,7/12/2010,"Dined here with a group and everyone enjoyed their meal.  The service was a bit sub-par but the drinks, appetizers, and entrees were exactly what was expected. The steaks were all cooked exactly to our liking.Nothing awesome about this place but nothing bad.  Right next to Madison Square Garden so it would be a nice place for a group after a game/event.  Rating should be 3.5 giving a 4 for the location. There are really no other restaurants competing in this neighborhood.",5,0,3,Jae J.,"New York, NY",87,89,28
2.0,4/30/2010,Nick & Stef's is a nice change of scenery considering the fact that the neighborhood that it belongs to is mostly populated by pubs and fast food joints.

5.0,3/1/2010,"I went to Nick and Stef's recently, looking for a great dinner experience before a concert.  I have to say, I was very impressed-as I am very picky about my culinary tastes, service standards and all around experience in a restaurant.  From beginning to end, I would say Nick and Stef's knows how to keep people coming back.  Our night started with a sweet hostess who took our coats, informed us of the wait time and when our table would be ready, and suggested we get drinks at the  bar.  We did, and it was enjoyable. Our bartender was funny and outgoing, made great drinks, and was very entertaining.  After one cocktail we were directed to our table-it was a corner booth in the back near a window-a perfect spot.  Our waiter was professional, very sociable, and incredibly knowledgable about the menu.  He also let us substitute anything we wanted and made great suggestions.  Our highlights of the night were the seafood platter as an appetizer, and the scallops entree and ribeye.  We had several sides, all which were good and left stuffed. Not being well versed on wine, we relied on our waiter to suggest one, and the cabernet that he picked was amazing with our dinners.  From now on, we will definitely make it a point to revisit this restaurant-even if we aren't going to a concert.  Simply good  service and a polite and friendly staff go a long way.  It doesn't hurt that the food was great too.",0,0,0,Patience B.,"New York, NY",8,6,0
3.0,2/17/2010,"I went to Nick+Stefs Steakhouse last week looking to satisfy by craving for some steak.  They did not disappoint.  The NY Strip I ordered was great, it was juicy and full of flavor.  The sweet potato fries were also amazing.  The prices here are a little high but, it was definitely a treat.",0,0,0,Thomas L.,"New York, NY",3,35,2
4.0,1/28/2010,"Real good midtown lunch. Great burger and great mac n cheese.

3.0,1/21/2010,"For the area in which the restaurant resides it is pretty good.  As for comparison against their competition throughout the city I would say this is an average second tier steakhouse.  Given the opportunity top go to Spark's, Del Frisco's, etc. I would opt for one of those.  I happen to work in teh vicinity of MSG, which is a restaurant wasteland.I had the NY Strip, which was cooked decently but didn't overwhelm me with the quality of teh cut or cook.  Sides were ok,  dessert's seemed just kind of present.  Nothing that blew me away.I will probably be back but that's more to do with convenience than actually wanting to be back in this particular restaurant.  Perhaps this is what they rely on.",0,0,0,Chris G.,"New York, NY",12,118,0
4.0,8/5/2009,"Expensive, but cool & quiet among Madison Sq Garden buzz.  Hostess was nice (volunteered quickly to hold my two bags).  Service was efficient if not overly pleasant.  Beefsteak tomatoes/mozzarella was a treat along with medium rare yellowtail tuna!!",1,0,0,Scott C.,"Wellesley, MA",12,178,3
3.0,8/3/2009,My husband and I visit steakhouses often and we were not a fan of this one.  Our appetizers were amazing but our meals were just okay.  I ordered the lobster bisque as a first course and it was the best soup I have ever had.  I highly recommend the bisque.  I ordered the chicken for my main dish and it was under flavored and only came with 3 potatoes.  My husband ordered a steak and it tasted like something we could make at home for half the price.  I would choose Ruth Chris or Craft Steak over this place.  The nice thing about this place is it is right by Madison Square Garden it midtown off of the 34th street subway exit which is a great accessible location in New York.,2,1,2,Dorothy M.,"Redlands, CA",6,13,1
1.0,7/29/2009,"I didn't like my steak, I didn't like the sides, I didn't like the wait staff, quite frankly, I didn't like anything about this restaurant.  So it's 5 stars, take away one star for each thing I didn't like.  That seems about right.",0,1,0,Yu-Ching L.,"New York, NY",94,188,1
3.0,7/16/2009,"This has great steaks and great service. The location is good for after work dinner. However, if you want wine, you will spend money!  Anyone who knows anything about wine, will see that the wine list prices are ridiculous. The mixed drinks are the way to go. They are made strong and made well. A couple of good cocktails along with the steak and service makes this a good place to go.",0,0,0,KERRY W.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,4,0
4.0,1/13/2009,"I'm truly alarmed this place doesn't have more buzz than some of the other hotshot steakhouses in New York City with a falsely advertised reputation. My boyfriend and I went here after watching Wintuk at Madison Square Garden and we got the porterhouse for two and we were very pleasantly surprised. The tenderloin portion of the porterhouse was the best filet I've ever had. That's how surprised we were. The meat was incredibly tender and seasoned just perfect. For sides, we ordered garlic sauteed spinach (as good as anywhere else) and sweet potato fries. I thought the sweet potato fries were really good and certainly satiated my preference for sweet & savory foods. The fries were large and thick, crispy on the outside and very sweet and moist on the inside. They sprinkled a good amount of coarse sea-salt on the outside for a nice contrast.Now that I've dined here, this place will certainly come to mind when I want a good filet mignon and not just some convenient/decent steakhouse near Penn Station.",4,0,1,Stella Y.,"Atlanta, GA",124,366,277
1.0,12/19/2008,"Disgusting. Mind you, I only made it to the bar. My experience there tells me to never eat at this restaurant. Ever. I came in with two classmates (the booze class, really!) just to have a nighcap before we went our separate ways. Very gross, for a bar. FLAT BEER. Doesn't that sound gross? Let me tell you, it IS. Blue Point Belgian White with no bubbles is like drinking liquid brick with malty flavors. My lemon (which I don't even agree with on principle... Europeans don't drink wheat beer with lemon, it's an American thing) was mostly pith. Even if I had wanted lemony flavor, I wouldn't have gotten with the sad piece of lemon I received. BAD CHARGE. My friend was charged for a Ketel One beverage and received one. She ordered a gin and tonic. Reputable bars DON'T serve top shelf liquor UNLESS a) specified by the cocktail, b) that brand is actually their well brand (rare). Ketel One's not even fucking gin, though. Additional notes include skeezy after-work crowd, less-than-attentive hostesses, and a bartender that took way more time than necessary to pour a gin and tonic and two flat beers.",5,1,2,Ingrid C.,"San Francisco, CA",376,584,207
3.0,12/12/2008,"We had very mixed results here. My wife and I went here on vacation and we had the best lobster bisque we've ever (and my risotto was great too).Our entrees on the other hand were nothing special. My steaf was boring, my wife's chicken was unflavorful, and the macaroni and cheese was terrible. The creamed spinach saved our night.

2.0,9/10/2008,"This steakhouse in Madison Square Garden is very crowded and I was told quite famous. However, the steaks and service were unimpressive. In fact, my steak was not juicy at all although my husband's steak was a bit better.",0,0,0,Regina J.,"Hoboken, NJ",52,63,0
3.0,9/9/2008,"Have met friends here for drinks and appetizers a few times. Some of my faves are the onion soup, fried calamari & iceberg wedge. I find it to be a bit pricey but the cocktails are made very well.  It's convenient to most train stations on the west side so it's a decent go to place to meet and catch up with friends.  Nice subtle interior. Interesting after work crowd on Thursdays and Fridays. Oh to be young hip and chic. Make a reservation if you want to dine here before an event at Madison Square Garden. You don't want to get caught in the tourist crowd. We love our tourist we are just on the move baby!!!",0,0,0,Sabrina W.,"New Haven, CT",189,385,80
4.0,8/20/2008,An upscale steak restaurant.  The wait staff is somewhat attentive to patrons' needs. It's clean with modest decor.  They offer a prix fixe lunch menu and dinner is very intimate for romantic couples celebrating anniversaries or birthdays.  It's very pricey.  The meats are tender.  Their desserts are very tasty.,2,0,1,Tina C.,"Queens, NY",2001,4196,9889
3.0,7/30/2008,"Restaurant Week 2008 ReviewNot impressed. Had the prix fixe lunch here which started with a bowl of mussels in white wine (4/5), followed an overcooked ""medium"" steak (2/4), finishing off with a dry chocolate mousse cake (2/5).The decor is modern steakhouse, clean lines, white table linens. The service was lacking (where's our server?), but it could be due to the lunch hour.Food: 3 starsService: 3 stars",2,0,1,Jase E.,"New York, NY",65,118,69
4.0,5/27/2008,"I recently started to go to this place and I must say that there steaks really hit the spot.  As for mostly everything else on their menu, so-so. Also, for midtown west/chelsea area the prices are decent. Not meaning they are cheap, but less expensive than most other place in the area. Very nice decor and great waiter service.

3.0,2/15/2007,"As steakhouses go, this one is solid, but not spectacular.  Still, the oysters were fresh, the fried calamari wasn't soggy, and the filet mignon was cooked just right.  As for sides, I have had better creamed spinach, but the mashed potatoes were really, really tasty.  The waiter was knowledgeable about wine and specials, and very prompt and attentive.  We got a little bit of snooty attitude from the woman who seated us, but the waiter was affable.  The prices were basically average for a steakhouse, which is to say, high, but not ridiculous.  If I were looking for steak in the MSG area again, I would definitely return.",1,0,1,Anna O.,"Lynbrook, NY",26,85,0
4.0,12/10/2006,"As Aaron stated below, this place is surprisingly good.  It's definitely no Del Frisco's Double Eagle, but the steak is quite succulent.Last night we had an early dinner there to get out of the freezing cold and crowded stores.  The onion soup with Guilere (sp?) cheese was VERY good.  Both of us had the filet mignon, although my wife said her medium cooked meat was on the dry side.  My medium rare was just right.They have a sides sampler where you pick any threee side dishes for $14.  A very, very good deal when each dish is $7.  The portions were more than adequate.  If you like mushrooms, I highly recommend the mushrooms as one of the side dishes.  They are sauteed but you get a variety of different fungi.  Awesome!!!We didn't save room for dessert so I'll have to comment on that next time.",1,0,1,Maome S.,"Emerson, NJ",28,209,4
3.0,10/24/2006,"Looking for a quick, but reasonably satisfying, bite before your favorite concert at MSG?  Options in this neighborhood traditionally haven't been great (and the superpretzel / Famiglia pizza combo you'd settle for at the concert gets old  quickly).  So Nick & Stef's was a pleasant surprise.  The menu has some tasty, albeit fairly conventional, options.  My trusty dining companion assured me the steak was good, and my seared tuna was high quality and nicely seasoned.  The french fries are satisfyingly crispy and salty.  Prices are high, but not outrageous (especially considering you'll pay 5 bucks for a Bud at the show).  But what really sets this place apart is that the friendly staff will get your meal to you shockingly fast, and you use the VIP entrance to the Garden to make it to your show before the opening act is halfway through its set.  A word of caution - it gets crowded here quickly before a big show - a reservation is a good idea.",1,0,1,Aaron K.,"New York, NY",8,42,0
