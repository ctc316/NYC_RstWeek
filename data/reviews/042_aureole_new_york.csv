5.0,4/21/2019,"Aureole was an absolute treat! The service was impeccable for the minute we walked in to the minute we left. We opted for the prix fixe, three course theater menu and were amazed by the quality and exquisite preparation of every dish in each course. The wait staff was attentive without being cloying and respectful of our time schedule. Would definitely recommend dining there again!",1,0,1,Janet S.,"Deerfield, IL",0,33,0
2.0,4/4/2019,"We couldn't understand why the NY Times gave this place 1 star, before we ate here. Now I know. The food is not terrible, but if you're a foody spending over $125 per person before drinks, this is not the place for you. It's hit and miss on the dishes, and probably fine for business meetings, pre-theater or if you're out of town and don't have restaurants like this at home. However, if you're looking for one of the top 100 restaurants in NYC, this is not it.  It's an absolutely beautiful room, but this isn't the Aureole you might remember from the Upper East Side in the renovated townhouse.  The food isn't comparable and the service isn't as refined.  They really should re-work the Foie Gras appetizer, definitely a miss.",0,0,0,Jeffrey W.,"Garden City, NY",24,4,0

3.0,3/28/2019,"Decent for work functions but feels like you're paying premium for the location and decor. Came here with a few coworkers for a late dinner on a weekday. It was pretty empty so we were seated right away in the dining area by the window. The open wine cellar and flowers made it a very open and welcoming decor. The menu was underwhelming though. The appetizer was probably the most interesting, lobster dumplings with a very savory cream sauce. It's almost like a thin layer of bisque with a few pieces of dumplings and lobster.The goat cheese salad was really tiny. The burgers were huge, while juicy wasn't anything special. You needed the ketchup for the extra flavor. The fish with bokchoy was well grilled but again didn't have any special flavors except for the foam sauce. Overall, great service but probably more suited for work functions than personal enjoyment.",1,0,0,Jess J.,"Brooklyn, NY",255,175,417

4.0,3/11/2019,"**Restaurant Week Review Winter 2019**I know. It's a month or so late, but in my book: better now than never! So what did I order? Out of the limited menu, I ordered the following:For appetizers, I ordered the Butternut Squash Velouté which was a soup that had toasted pumpkin seeds, aged balsamic vinegar, with a smoked Long Island duck breast. It was creamy but at the same time very flavorful. I wish there were more of the duck breast, but I can't complain. For the entrée, I got the Cabernet Sauvignon Braised Short Rib which is served with creamy polenta, brussels sprouts, espelette and I opted to add the 2g of truffles ($10). Yes, the truffles was extra, but why not? Restaurant week was the one time to do it and do it correctly. The short rib was moist and had a great flavor. There was a hint of the cab flavor, but most of the alcohol obviously cooks off. However, the short rib was great. For dessert, we ordered two of the menu dessert items the Dark Chocolate Financier and the Amaretto Carrot Cake. The chocolate financier came with marcona almond nougatine, pear-tonka bean sorbet and the carrot cake was served with maple caramel, cream cheese ice cream. I'm not a big dessert person, but with this dessert it wasn't that sweet and I enjoyed it. The dress code was a concern of mine, but if you sit out in the dining area (and not the room in the back) you'll be fine in jeans and just a collared shirt. I don't even think I had a collared shirt, and just went in there in jeans as I just trekked from LES. Anyways, the service was great...as expected, and I had a relatively late lunch thus we were one of the last ones to leave the restaurant. Overall, great experience and definitely worth it for restaurant week!",1,1,1,Bruce K.,"Lawrenceville, GA",478,864,1648

The food was good but not spectacular. The black truffle risotto had plenty of truffles but the filet mignon was unremarkable. The broccolini seemed over-salted.

5.0,2/23/2019,"This is a great spot for a business lunch.Stopped by for a lunch with a client and was pleasantly surprised. The space is open and elegant, featuring an exposed stockroom of wines on the second floor. It's a fancy spot, but offers an affordable 2 course ($45) / 3 course ($53) prix fixe menu.I started with the Butternut Squash Velouté to start, chose the Scottish salmon for a main, and opted to skip on dessert. Everything was delicious... The velouté had two tender, thinly sliced strips of duck bathing in its richness. The salmon was hearty and soft in the middle and rested on a bed of perfectly cooked beans.The prices of normal dishes can be quite pricey... especially for dinner, but it's definitely worth it!",1,1,1,Nick P.,"New York, NY",505,83,197

4.0,2/17/2019,"*Restaurant Week Winter 2019 Review*Came here for Friday (last day of RW!) night dinner with the bf. When we arrived the place was already lively with chatter and walking into the Liberty Room, you're greeted with their impressive wine display on the floor above. Service was amazing and nicely paced. I loved that they asked us as we were seated if we had an event after that we would need to rush for (we said no, this dinner was the event for the night). Appetizer:Butternut Squash Velouté: this was originally my date's order but after an initial taste I was in love, and being the gentleman he is, he offered to trade apps (thank you!). The soup was very creamy, which was contrasted with a crunch by the pumpkin seeds. On the bottom sat two thinly sliced smoked Long Island Duck breast, which brought a savory aspect to the dish. Smoked Brook Trout Rillette: not my cup of tea, but bf loved it...said it reminded him of his days in Europe. Entree: Scottish Salmon (with cannellini bean cassoulet and baby turnips): if I were to rate this dish alone, it's more of a 3.5/5. I love salmon, but nothing really made an impression on me with this dish. I asked for medium, but it came out more well done. The only best part was how it was perfectly pan seared and you get a really nice crunch on the outside. Cabernet Sauvignon Braised Short Ribs: my date did it again with choosing the superior option. Short ribs were very tender and went well with the creamy polenta and perfectly roasted brussels sprouts. Dessert:Chocolate w/ pear gelato: if you're obsessed with chocolate this is the dessert for you. The dish was uber decadent, but it was well balanced out with the refreshing pear gelato. Carrot Cake w/ Cream Cheese Gelato: I repeat. With cream cheese gelato. That is all. Just kidding, carrot cake was standard but with a twist of crispy carrot shaving toppings.",1,0,1,Tanya K.,"Queens, NY",340,126,331

Zack, despite us being absolute brats with every aspect of the night, made sure we were tended to and happy.For a little background we were late cause of the bus and had to leave cause of the Lion king.

3.0,2/7/2019,"I went for the 2019 NYC Winter Restaurant week. Keep in mind that the restaurant is divided into two seconds: the Liberty Room and the Dining Room. Only the Liberty Room offers the restaurant week deals.Aureole is conveniently located just a block away from Bryant Park. The place itself is very modern and upscale.To Start: Butternut Squash Veloute: smoked duck breast under a squash velouteSmoked Brook Trout Rillette: trout roe, butter briocheMain Course:Cabernet Sauvignon Braised Short Rib: short rib with Brussel sproutsScottish Salmon: salmon with cannellini beansDessert:Dark Chocolate Financier: almond nougatine with sorbetAmaretto Carrot Cake: caramel with cream cheese ice creamTo start, the Butternut Squash Veloute was amazing. The soup was very creamy in nature, but there was only the slightest bit of duck given. The Smoked Brook Trout Rillette was great with the toasted bread pieces that came with it. The short ribs were tough, dry, and rather tasteless.The Scottish Salmon was just okay. The salmon was well cooked but not well flavored. The dish itself was overall quite bland. Both the desserts were decent. The carrot cake was too sweet, and I would recommend the chocolate dessert instead.Overall, Aureole is definitely a great place to bring a date. The location is great, the service was amazing but unfortunately, I was rather disappointed with the food.",2,1,2,Cherry J.,"New York, NY",359,34,91
3.0,2/6/2019,"I was really looking forward to this dinner, especially with all of the great reviews, but I must say I was disappointed. Perhaps it's because I went for restaurant week and the dishes were 'mass produced' to some degree but it didn't exactly leave me wanting to return. I started with the endive salad and some of the greens were bitter-tasting; I could barely taste any vinaigrette, so it was also dry. The braised short rib was fatty, I had to take several chunks out of my mouth; didn't feel like I could fully enjoy it. The carrot cake was okay, a bit too sweet for my taste. Despite the unfortunate culinary experience, the service and staff were excellent and attentive, which is what deserves the most credit. The quality of the food shouldn't be compromised during RW, it should be a sampling of what customers get regularly to attract new ones. Hopefully it can be improved for the next go around.",0,0,0,Katherine P.,"New York, NY",135,101,4

3.0,1/24/2019,"We went here for restaurant week, and the overall experience was fair. The short rib entree that I picked was really good- great flavors, well cooked meat, and cute presentation.They had a $20 wine pairing option (2 wines), for the restaurant week menu, and I would not recommend spending your $$ on that. The pours were extremely small, and the wines themselves, while good, weren't very uncommon or specially curated.One thing to expect in general is smaller quantities for a relatively larger amount of $$. NYC rents and spaces are definitely a flavor here ;)The regular menu is looks good. Overall, it was good for going to once, but we may not frequent this.

It's suitable for dates and business lunch/dinner.I am not sure if they have a dress code since I am always dressed, better to call in and double check!It was pretty quiet when I went there on a Friday night, there were only 5-6 tables in a whole restaurant but I did enjoy the tranquility.The staff was nice and the service was quick, hopefully they can still keep it this way even if the restaurant is filled up.Menu wise, they do offer:three selectable courses/six fixed courses(with or without wine pairing) or à la carte.First off they would serve you multiple choices of bread. The Oliver oil on the table is A grade!with a hint of herbal taste in it.LOVE IT!The oyster was fresh and it's the small one which I prefer over the bigger one.The salmon and venison I ordered were perfectly cooked nothing more nothing less. Each bite has a different taste than the other one, especially the venison. It got the scent of pine tree, goes perfectly with the creamy celery purée.I had a special drink made by the bartender, it was refreshing and it looked pretty with the crystal glasses.At the end I had a wonderful dessert to finish my wonderful meal, while the Mont Blanc didn't look like the way I am used to but it tasted exactly the same way I wanted it to be which is a rich creamy chestnut purée-I missed it.Also they told me a lot of people go in for a bite while they are waiting for broadway shows. The lighting inside is also great for photos.I was way happier than I thought I would be leaving the restaurant!

Expect men and women in suits and an average age somewhere in the 40s.But kudos to the waitstaff! Aside from the unfriendly millennial hostess our waiter could not have been more pleasant or down to earth. He smiled, was genuinely funny and nice and made us feel welcome even though I was one of the few men in the room not wearing a suit. All of the waitstaff were a tightly coordinated symphony of movement, swooping in at the right time, replacing silverware and filling up water glasses. This is a well oiled machine.The food was excellent. The burger was one of the better ones I've had in a town full of burgers. My wife proclaimed the chicken was some of the best she's ever had with a delicious reduction. Our friend's fish was cooked to perfection.

1.0,12/2/2018,"A big fat F for Aureole!  Not for its food, but for its unbelievably poor service. I have been dining in better NYC restaurants for over 25 years and have developed a sixth sense when something is awry, and my alarm bells started going off almost from the beginning. Uncertainty at the podium about our table, intense distraction at the bar (order taken after 15 minutes, drinks never served), hour-long lapses between courses, slow as molasses wine service.  Our dinner took 3 hours!  It was only because we were celebrating our son's 21st birthday and I didn't want to make a scene that I remained calm and enjoyed the moment.  We were not in a rush and the occasion was more important. Upon leaving (at 11PM!) we witnessed another patron giving the manager a piece of her mind about this insultingly shabby service.  He seemed remorseful, but he already knew..  Why?  My theory is that a large table, perhaps 20 people, gorging on an elaborate wine and food menu, were sapping the venue for wait staff, sommelier resources, with devastating ripple-through affect across the floor.  All the elements were there:  truly excellent food, a knowledgeable waiter, a helpful sommelier but they all seemed distracted and uncoordinated, playing tag team - like they knew something we didn't.  In the movie version is could have been: the chef just keeled over on the stove, or management announced the restaurant was closing, or that the person who actually manages the floor stormed out the day before, or even that this was a twisted version of candid camera where all the front of house personnel were recruited off the street that day.  But alas, I don't think it was any of those things.  It was simply a failure to maintain quality of service and most infuriating, a failure to acknowledge it and apologize, or make it right.  I will NEVER come back to Aureole, which seems to now join other high volume, quickly getting shabby, inconsistent theatre district B level eateries.  It's a shame because Aureole used to be a NYC gem, particularly in it's previous location. This is a management issue and management should be held accountable. Meanwhile, I'm $800 poorer and feel ripped off.",1,0,0,David D.,"Westport, CT",0,12,3

My pictures don't do it justice.  The thoughtful way it was prepared and presented taking into account textures and colors told me we were in for an excellent experience. The salmon was poached in a light smoky oil so it was not overwhelming, there was a hint of horseradish pop as the perfect foil to the richness of the dish, topped with a crisp to add a bit of crunch, it's making my mouth water just remembering it.We each had a main, the duck and the veal cheeks, both were flawless and delicious. If your expecting a plate full not you kind of place, this is more of a few perfect bites, but more than enough to satisfy.We ended with the hazelnut desert, wow!

5.0,11/2/2018,"Aureole is a modern American restaurant that has some modernist cuisine leanings. The space is elegant, but not overdone, and the service is excellent, if not a bit austere and dry. They have a few pre-fix menus, based on the number of courses you'd like. The menu is finished by a substantial wine list, artisan cocktails, and other libations. I got the tasting menu, which was five courses, and I added white truffles to two of the courses. A standout was the cured salmon, soft duck yolk, puréed spinach, caviar, and truffles. That was quite an epic dish!  A very high-end place,  and one I'd highly recommend!",2,0,1,Jason H.,"Philadelphia, PA",79,282,0
2.0,11/2/2018,"NOT IMPRESSED.This restaurant does not deserve Michelin. I went for my mom's birthday and had we not laughed everything off and embraced what was happening, this experience would have been TRAGIC. Here is everything that went wrong:1. Waiter misses wine glass while pouring and spills wine all over the table and the glass and instead of getting a new glass and covering the stain, just wipes down the glass with a napkin 2. Waiter says a dish is quail egg when the egg is clearly large and when I say are you sure? He goes to check and says it's a duck egg...3. Waiters don't ask us how we want our lamb cooked and then bring us rare lamb which was not our preference 4. Since it was my mom's bday the waiter offers my mom a complimentary port and starts leaving and my mom asks ""aren't you going to offer some to my daughter"" And he comes back and says oops didn't know she drank even though I have a negroni in front of me. 5. FOOD IS SO MEDIOCRE. Nothing special about it. Not one dish in the 5 course tasting menu made me think ""hmm that's pretty good"" and the seared foie gras almost made me sick from the fattiness6.

The environment is definitely more than your jeans and t-shift type of crowd, but not stuffy - think more chic and business casual. We came to check out the restaurant week menu and we were not disappointed. We started by the bar where I ordered the Tale of Two Isles, which basically tasted like a non-frozen piña colada (in a good way). Once our table was ready we were assisted by the knowledge somm and picked out a fine bottle of red wine (it was ~$135 and I wish I remembered what it was because it was amazing). For the restaurant week menu, I went with the salmon tartare, striped bass, and summer strawberries. All of it was so good. Usually striped bass doesn't wow me but it's been over a week and I still keep casually thinking about it.

The ambiance is chic and lovely, and the meal was a solid three stars. It was really just okay for me. First off, the salmon ceviche was covered in sauce (or mayo?). Why? It was too gooey for me. Salmon is perfect on its own, especially when in a dish that's supposed to be raw. I didn't particularly enjoy this appetizer, and wish the sauce was on the side. The bass was great and fresh, and the bed of vegetables it was on was even better. It was a tiny portion (finished it in five minutes, as did my friend), but it was a healthy amount. I guess they were going the upscale way. Especially liked the skin!The strawberries and sponge cake dessert was eh. Came with a spoonful of vanilla ice cream, which I enjoyed, but the rest was nothing that was to be missed. Also, the service was incredibly slow. Where is that city hustle, y'all?

This was a good portion and had a nice flavor, but nothing to write home about overall.I ordered the striped bass for my appetizer and again it was very good--but fell short of excellent. Also, I felt that the peach did not really seem pickled, but rather just marinated in a sweet liquid.For dessert, I went with the summer strawberries, which were good but not the level of flavor I was expecting from a restaurant of this caliber.Overall, we both enjoyed our meals, but like I mentioned earlier, I was left a bit underwhelmed.

Entree: Striped Sea Bass, Garganelli di Gragnano (pasta)The fish was crispy, but was dry and had tender portions of meat - came with charred corn, pickled peach and tarragon. The pasta was almost so light in texture I felt like it took me seconds to finish and like I wasnt really chewing anything - the taste was delicious though, with parmigiana and sundried tomatoes.Dessert: Summer Strawberry Sponge Cake, Two Tone Chocolate Mousse CakeThe 2 cakes were a perfect finish to the meal; i'd recommend getting one of each as they were a great combo or tart and rich. The sponge cake came with strawberries with spearmint paste and vanilla ice cream on the side while the mousse cake encompassed yogurt and caramel ice cream.Overall I always enjoy coming to Aureole; its a high quality atmosphere and the service is great - Restaurant Week is always a perfect opportunity to get a full course experience here without the possibly intimidating standard menu and high prices.

It was a very beautifully decorated and dimly lit room. Perfect for the occasion.We started off by ordering 2 cocktails, I got the Tale of Two Isles and my boyfriend got the PJ something drink. The cocktails came out pretty fast, strong and simply delicious. For $15 a drink, it was pretty darn good!Shortly after, our first course arrived which we both ordered the Salmon Tartare. It was delicious and had interesting flavors especially with the vegetables on top. I really enjoyed that dish.Next, came our entree. I got the chicken and my boyfriend got the bass. The flavors of the chicken was extremely well put together and it was still very juicy and flavorful. I had a bite of the bass and it was equally as good!Lastly, came our dessert. The dessert part I was a bit disappointed with. I could tell that they premade the dish due to the condensation of the plate and it did have a ""dust hair"" on it. Slightly disappointed because it is a Michelin star restaurant so I had to deduct .5 stars for that.The other .5 stars that I had to deduct was for the bathrooms.

This place was bookmarked in my list of restaurants to try, and I was very excited to finally check it out. My friend made the reservation, and we arrived on the dot at 7:45pm. We got seated at a table and ordered 3 course dinner menu.I came in with high expectations for Aureole, partially because it has the one Michelin star and partially because my husband told me that he had a good time couple years ago.I am not sure if it was the restaurant week craziness or not, but the noise level was very high almost to the point where I had to yell across the table to to talk to my friend. I was not provided with good description for the questions I had on the menu; also the waitress seemed very unenthusiastic (or too busy).We started with a basket of cold bread and butter. For the first course, we had summer squash veloute and salmon tartare. Both were delicious and very satisfying. The main entree was chicken for both of us (recommended by our waitress). The chicken was very dry, bland, and tough. It almost made me think I was recommended with chicken dish because it was pre-made for restaurant week and was all set to serve. Dessert was good- pretty presentation and mediocre taste. Since Aureole is a Michelin starred restaurant, it's hard for me not to compare it with other Michelin starred restaurants I've been to. I've been to ~15 NYC Michelin restaurants so far, and I have to say Aureole ranks at the bottom of my list for the two primary reasons- delayed/inattentive service and mediocre food.

4.0,7/25/2018,"I am in NY this week on business and tonight I invited the CEO of one of our client companies to join me for dinner at Aureole. As everyone knows it has is a one star Michelin restaurant.  So you expect something more special -- better, setting, better service and most important better than usual food. I found tonight's experience hit the mark on all fronts.First, the restaurant is situated on 42nd Street very close to Bryant Park. Good location and easy ( is anything easy in NYC during summer?) to get to.  Walk in the front door to a lovely feeling interior, correct mood lighting and the right vibe. What isn't apparent at first is the second seating area behind the front room and the check in counter. When we started wailing back I got this dreaded feeling I was being shunted to the ""annex"" out of the main restaurant. Not so, thankfully. Rather this peaceful pleasant more quiet oasis awaits to give you just the right setting to enjoy your dinner. Now I know I'd always request this seating. Charlie Palmer has brought his Chicago flair to NY and has done a very nice job. Look I read most all the reviews and I can say that the negative ones were not my experience at all.  We both had the 3 course menu and while pricy at $96 each ( this is NY By the way) I thought both savory courses were both excellent. One order of Sea Bass the other scallops. The first courses were both heirloom tomato and buffalo mozzarella salads. Sorry I didn't do pics. Service was attentive, not pushy.

Wish there was olive oil instead of butter. We also ordered French fries from the regular menu. So gooood and addictive! We literally finished the very last one from the bottom of the bowl.Entrees: striped bass was awesome!! Skin was perfectly fried. Chicken was tender.Desserts: both were delicious.

The menu was very limited and not inventive besides some pickled or poached things on the side of a dish. The staff was unhelpful and unenthusiastic about the menu. When we asked our waiter what his favorites were he said I don't know and finally said the duck--which was just fine. The fois grad was very good. It is the reason for 2 stars. Really great texture and flavor. The garganelli was not very flavorful and my sister had to ask for Parmesan cheese to give the pasta some kind of flavor. I had the bass. Tasted like nothing. It was over a bed of barely that almost tasted sour from too much lemon. There was nice presentation for the desserts both the chocolate and the pistachio one were very pretty, but lacked flavor. To end our meal they gave us petit fours, and one of them, a chocolate caramel, was very good. All in all, it wasn't worth the price. I've had more flavor from the Cheesecake Factory.",0,0,0,Drew L.,"New York, NY",402,64,88
4.0,6/21/2018,"On a recent weekend trip to NYC we stopped in to the formal dining room of Aureole. I found it by searching for michelin star restaurants, although I found it difficult to confirm if they had one or not. That said I've been to a hand full of 1 and 2 star michelin star restaurants and this has been my least favorite to date. The food was good, don't get me wrong, the service was pleasant and helpful the restaurant it's self was very average for an upscale restaurant there wasn't even a place to put my purse and it fell on the floor because I had to hang it on my chair, every other michelin star restaurant I've been to has had some solution to slinging my purse on the chair so I guess I was expecting a higher level of service in some aspects. This felt like a nice restaurant but of the same level of quality of any other non michelin Star up scale restaurant. There was just nothing exception to the point I would have considered this to be so far above and beyond - it wasn't insanely expensive and I felt the value was there for the price and if I hadn't been expecting a michelin star experience I would have rated it five stars.",0,0,0,Amber M.,"Issaquah, WA",34,59,70
3.0,6/11/2018,"3.5/5Came by during my most recent NY trip which just happened to align with restaurant week. Needed a restaurant in this area and decided to give Aureole a try. Made a reservation for one very easily online. Hosts at the front were very kind. Service during the meal was polite though not too warm. They made sure to check up on me now and then at least.For my meal I ordered the following: 1) Peach Sage Tea: Wonderful drink and a nice alternative to have since I'm trying to drink less. Very refreshing, not too sweet, and the sage pairs very well with the peach (5/5)2) Kale & Crab Salad w/ Asian Pear, Lime, Buttermilk dressing: Appetizer from RW menu. Kale wasn't tough and you definitely get the silky mouthfeel from the buttermilk but all the other flavors just weren't there. Nothing really complemented each other, nothing really stood out either. The main part I enjoyed was the crab because...crab. (3/5)3) 48 Hour Braised Veal Cheeks w/ Mustard Greens, White Polenta, Roasted Roots: The best dish of the night. The veal cheeks were extremely soft and melted in my mouth in meaty layers of fatty goodness. The roasted roots were firm yet creamy and provided a nice contrast. The polenta was good though nothing particularly special. I was really looking for something to set the dish above and beyond in the flavor department. Didn't quite find that but I was happy overall. (4.25/5)4) Valrhona Chocolate & Peppermint Torte: A bit torn by this dish. I did love the firm smooth texture of the torte and the rich chocolate but the peppermint overpowered everything else. I enjoy chocolate/mint but I want the chocolate as the star and here I just kept thinking I was biting into a junior mint where 70% of the flavors were just trying to freshen my breath. (3/5)5) Complimentary Cookie Cone: A nice gesture and I can't argue w/ a freebie but the cookies were sort of like high end tiny famous amos cookies. Dry and kind of saw-dusty but I'm glad they were thin and had a nice snap. I was pretty full at this point so I just took a small nibble and it wasn't really worth the stomach space (2/5)Decent deal for the price but the flavors of the appetizer and dessert were just so average. I'm a bit surprised they have a Michelin star. I never expect Restaurant Week to be up to par to normal standards but I also don't expect to be flat out disappointed by multiple courses either.",2,1,2,Vivian C.,"Azusa, CA",622,939,1189

2.0,6/4/2018,"Like many other reviewers here, I am having a difficult time understanding how Aureole secured a Michelin star. The food and the service were extremely uneven.We went pre-theater. We had a 5:30 reservation and let the server know that we needed to be finished by 7:30. She said ""Oh, we have plenty of time."" There were 4 of us. We ordered the Crab + Apple, the Prime Beef Tartare, and the Foie Gras + Apricot ""Napolean"" for appetizers. All were excellent.For the second course, we ordered the Cavatelli and the Tagliatelle. Here's where things started going downhill. While well cooked, the Tagliatelle was nearly flavorless. The Cavatelli was undercooked to the point of being inedible. The server offered to have the Cavatelli remade, but at that point we didn't have time -- so I declined.For entrees, we ordered the Free Range Chicken Breast, the Long Island Duck Breast, the Aureole Burger, and the Flatiron Steak. The chicken, duck, and burger were fine -- although the white asparagus accompanying the duck was without flavor. The server sets a filet mignon in front of me. I told him I had ordered the flatiron steak -- at which point he takes the filet away. A few minutes later, the Maitre D' returns with the filet. He tells me that there isn't time for them to correct the error before we have to leave -- but that I could have the filet on the house. He wouldn't charge me for either the filet or the flatiron steak. I thought that was a top-notch thing to do. Kudos to him.We did not have time for dessert.Yes, the Maitre D' did the right thing. But the food gaffes and serving error leave me a bit perplexed. I don't feel the need to return to Aureole -- but I certainly hope the Guide Michelin will.",0,0,0,Eric W.,"Sterling, VA",1,40,0

2.0,5/13/2018,"I am so disappointed in Aureole for ruining my Mothers Day.  My mom had been looking forward to her Mothers Day Brunch at this restaurant for weeks.  She read the menu beforehand and was already prepared with what she wanted to order.  We arrived at 1pm and told the waiter we had to leave at 2:30pm to catch a 3pm play.  He said, ""no problem, I put that on your ticket and I'll make sure we move things along.""  We had an appetizer at 1:30pm, so things were looking good...but then nothing after that. Everyone around us was getting food, but by 2:15pm we still had not been served.  After notifying the restaurant manager and waiter the food was quickly rushed out. Too rushed out...my salmon was undercooked and mostly inedible. My mom liked her chicken, but had to eat it fast because the clock was ticking and we didn't want to miss the play.  We didn't even have time for dessert.  Because they could see we barely had time to eat the food the restaurant comped the meal and apologized multiple times. That is nice and I appreciate the gesture, but I feel so bad for my mom.  She barely got to enjoy her food, and had to order a sandwich in Penn Station afterwards because she was still hungry.  And we didn't get to talk and catch up because we were both so anxious about the food not coming out.  I appreciate the meal being free, but we were willing to pay for good food and a memorable experience. I know they were sincere in their apologies, but Mothers Day comes once a year and I will never be able to get this day back.",2,1,0,Adrienne C.,"Hoboken, NJ",8,75,5
1.0,5/10/2018,"SO disappointed, especially since this restaurant has a Michelin star.  This restaurant has been on my ""To Try"" list for a few years.5:15 - I had a reservation for one, and showed up exactly on time.  I was seated at a table with two place settings, and given a dinner menu. When my waiter finally came over at 5:25, he asked, ""Do you want a drink while you wait for your guest?""  I did, but I had never received a drink menu, and I told him that I was not waiting for a guest. He also asked if I wanted bottled or house water (house? haha). 5:25 - still no water, but I did now have a cocktail menu.5:30 - I ordered my cocktail, the foie gras appetizer, and the scallop entree. Since things were taking a while, I thought it might be a good idea to inform the waiter that I needed to leave by 6:25. 5:40 - cocktail arrives. I ordered the Sgt. Pepper, which was actually awesome. And - water!5:45 - I finally receive some bread and butter, but I declined it. Trying to watch the carbs and all. 5:50 - foie gras comes out. Good dish, albeit tiny. Perfect for just me, but would be difficult to share.6:00 - empty cocktail glass... nobody asked if I wanted another (I did). 6:15 - someone brings me bread. I tell them that I already declined it.  He asks if I want another cocktail, but I let him know that I wouldn't have time, since I have to leave in 10 minutes and haven't received my entree yet. He said he'd get a manager.6:20 - Scallops come out. They look like they were just haphazardly thrown on the plate - messy, sideways. I cut into it, take a bite - it's virtually inedible. Overdone, tough, rubbery. My waiter asks ""How is everything?"" and I say ""Well, not good, because I have to leave in 5 minutes, and I can't eat this."" He said he'd get the manager, and I told him that someone else had already gone to do that but the manager never showed. Meanwhile, I've had my credit card out and on the table for 10 minutes. I can see the managers at the front desk. Nobody is making their way to my table, so I got up, took my things and told one man, ""I need to leave. The service was so slow and I am now going to be late AND I could not eat my entree because it was overcooked. I just wanted to pay for what I did eat, and leave. The manager said, ""Just go, it's on me"" - which was the right thing to do, but I certainly would never have expected this kind of service from a 1-star Michelin restaurant. This was a Tuesday at 5:15. It was NOT that busy. Both the table to my left and right were also having issues. I asked both parties if they had been to the restaurant before and if so, if it is always like this. They both said that it was their first time (like me), and that they would not be returning.

After mutual angry stares, he did agree to take my item off the bill. Unconvinced, I felt, he then apologized for ""misreading"" me. I tipped him well saying, ""I never stiff a waiter.""  He never offered another another dessert. I left with a bad taste in my mouth and a nearly $300  bill.

5.0,4/13/2018,"Summary: best lunch option in Manhattan I know. Come at least once every few weeks and get a different pre-fixe to try new dishes that are consistently good and often great.This has been my favorite sit down lunch place in Manhattan since I first ate here more than 10 years ago.The lunch pre-fixe for three courses is always great value, at 55 after taxes and 67 after tip over the course about an hour. The food isn't always perfect but it is always at least good and usually very good. For the price point, it is easily one of the best 1 hour sit down pre-fixe you can get anywhere.Their soups, sauces, and desserts are consistently good. Be warned some of their protein dishes, usually the main, seems to beg for a glass of wine although they are usually still very good even without the wine.My experience today:Salmon tartare. Very nicely and lightly flavored with little bits of apple to add some sweetness, texture, and even a little acidity. Very nice.Pork tenderloin. It tasted like a very nice block of prosciutto or ham. The tenderloin itself was on the salty side but was delicious if eaten together with the rice/sauce/tomato on the plate. I felt a VERY strong urge to get a nice glass of wine because I think that's what I needed to make this dish perfect. I enjoyed it but I wouldn't order it again unless I can drink wine with it.White chocolate raspberry tart is amazing. The pastry is crunchy but not so hard you can't break it with a fork.  The raspberry jam/sauce below the tart made sure every bite of the tart had a little raspberry.  Then every couple of bite I had a little of the yuzu sorbet to cleanse the palate a little bit and enjoy the tart anew. I loved everything about this desert.  It's not the most original and I would have liked more of the sorbet but I absolutely recommend it.I also come here and just order a salad/soup/dessert and a flat iron steak and have all come out at the same time.  The service is very prompt and I usually get my food in 15-20 minutes.  I wouldn't try this if the place is packed but I never failed out finish my lunch within an hour if there is even only a few open tables. I usually get out in about 40 minutes.  The service really is quite prompt.Another reason I love coming here is the menu actually changes and if you give it a couple weeks between visits, you will find new dishes to try... and they will not disappoint.I can also recommend their dinner service. For dinner time the place is more like one of many fine dining prefixe  menus in Manhattan instead of being a true standout, IMO. But it tends to be less crowded than the broadway ""preshow"" options and the more modern decor appeals to many. It also tends to be more casual, making it suitable for everyday dinners without dressing up to the 9s. It's an excellent option if you're staying in the area and are looking for an excellent, quiet, and relatively casual meal.",2,0,0,Alex J.,"Washington, DC",31,91,143

3.0,4/10/2018,"We came here for dinner before a show. They offer a three course prix fixe menu between 5pm and 6pm (you can order from the regular menu, too). Food:I ended up ordering from the prix fixe menu as it seemed like a good deal ($55). I thought the portion size was ver generous, particularly the first course, but the quality was just ok. I liked my first course (pasta) more than the main course (steak). While it was cooked to perfection and it was tender, the flavor of the steak was literally just ok. The price is acceptable only because of the convenience and the portion size.Sadly, the highlight of my meal was the bread. They serve different kinds of bread (for free). The focaccia was REALLY good.  Ambience:The ambience is definitely upscale and possibly intimate. I'm sure it's depending on where you are seated, but the gigantic neon sign across the street from the restaurant kills the ambience. When the T-Mobile sign comes on, the restaurant turns pink!

2.0,4/1/2018,"They got us in on short notice, which was great. Once they got to the table, the service was good and they were willing to customize the fixed menu, which some places aren't. Their normal seven course fixed menu had duck, then swordfish, then tenderloin... Too much meat. I substituted the scallops for the swordfish and lobster for the tenderloin (which I had the night before and am, quite frankly, tired of). The food was... just ok. None of us at the table 'oohed' once. More like 'Meh'.  The broccolini was bitter. I ordered the lobster, which was not even edible. This was surprising to me since we are on the east coast. Half a lobster that was pretty much raw in a weak bit of broth, a piece of fennel and a few slices of carrot. It was gross. Looked gross, tasted gross and if it did taste good, I'd mention the 2 oz. of meat I paid $10 extra bucks for. Also, they had squat for non-alcoholic beverages. Not even on the drink menu. Overall, not at all worth the money and I'm surprised it has a Michelin star. Stark contrast to my experience at Greymercy Tavern the previous night.

1.0,2/1/2018,Went in for restaurant week. I ordered the Salmon. After taking 2 bites of the food I found a long red worm like string in the Salmon! Mind you this this is seared Salmon so 90% of the meat was raw. I picked through the meat some more and found another worm. I stopped eating at this point. I texted a photo to my chef friend and she later confirmed that it was definitely worms and the salmon must been old. I feel sick to my stomach as I had already eatten a few bites of the salmon before my disgusting discovery. I am now afraid of getting tape worms as the fish was pretty much raw.

Chic, classy, and beautiful. But most importantly, the service was phenomenal. The waiter was the ideal amount of friendly and checked on me and my colleague promptly. The dishes were cleared after each course and new utensils brought out- genuinely fantastic service. Food- 5/5We both started off with a glass of Sancerre, which was delightfully light and aromatic. As for the food, the RW menu had a variety of options that were not overwhelming and honestly they were all so delicious!Appetizers:Kale & Crab Salad- very light and yet creamy? A nice salad- if you like salads- to start off the meal. The thinly sliced radish, kale, and crab were a nice little bite together.Cavatelli with squid- the pasta had a good dense chewy texture and was flavored well with a nice amount of pesto sauce and tender pieces of squid.Mains:Salmon- perfectly cooked with a super thin crispy skin! The waiter advised this is usually cooked medium but I had asked for well done and it was executed exactly right! Delicious flaky fish by itself; not sure the apple jus they poured over the dish did much but it was quite pretty a presentation.Sunflower Risotto- the surprise dish of the day! Not sure what I expected but the creamy, nutty, and slightly sweet risotto was addicting! Such a comforting dish that I could not stop eating this- the crunchy sunflower seeds had a great contrasting texture to the soft risotto.Desserts:Winter Tangerine Cake- we both ordered this and cleaned off the plates! The tangerine cake was moist with a light fruity flavor and topped off with the cranberry sorbet made such a summery delicious bite. The dollops of chocolate sweetness was just enough to balance the tartness.Cone of Cookies- this was a complimentary dish but it had an assortment of chocolate chip cookies, almond topped cookies etc- each one more delectable than the last.You won't regret trying this place- especially at RW rates, totally worth it!",1,0,0,Jinny C.,"Queens, Queens, NY",1,49,290

Yes, we were a large party (13ish) but we still had a reservation -- they shouldn't take reservations they don't have the space for. Then, we had to wait a ridiculously long time to get our food between each course. We were at the restaurant for almost three and a half hours for three courses (appetizer, entree, dessert), and it was some of the slowest service I've ever had. The food was quite good, but the portions were small for what we paid. I had risotto as an appetizer, and it was good but about half of what I would consider a serving. Between the appetizer and entree we were served a tiny pinch of caviar (legitimately a pinch in a tiny cup). Again, good, but I'm not sure a pinch is worth it. I ordered the scallops for my main course, and literally received four scallops. They were arranged really beautifully on the plate, and were very good, but even so, four scallops is hardly a meal. The desserts were very good though a bit plain.

We started off with champagne, then had the tuna tar tar and wagyu beef appetizer, both mouth watering that I couldn't decide which was better! We then each had a cocktail, one was whiskey, other brandy, again both so fresh and hand crafted to perfection. I ordered the duck and it came in slices and was so tender and cooked perfect, my boyfriend got the ranch ribeye and you know I ate half of his too! SO good, especially this crispy potato part that came with it.

3.0,1/4/2018,"I find that with Michelin-starred places, it becomes difficult to separate the experience from the expectation when reviewing. Aureole was the perfect example of this phenomenon.Had I walked in to a small hole-in-the-wall joint, paid a reasonable amount, and gotten the experience I had tonight, I would have been blown out of the water. When considering it's a 1-Michelin, $125 tasting menu, however, it becomes a little underwhelming.To start with the service - it was distinctly more casual than I was expecting - which I actually prefer but I also understand it's not for everyone. Our server was distinctly human unlike the perfectionist robots that I've gotten at Bouley and Daniel. He was very genuine and was able to make small talk that didn't seem rehearsed. The hostess was also warm, and on top of that we were given probably the best table in the house, so the full experience was very un-stuffy for such a nice place. The inside of the restaurant is absolutely lovely, place settings were changed efficiently, etc.We opted for the 5 course, $125 tasting menu (a $96 3-course and a $148 7-course chef's tasting are also available). A small amuse bouche of some squash dish was brought out first which was a yummy start. An oddly quiet server brought out a selection of breads, from which I opted for the whole grain. The first course was a yellow fin tuna tartare with fennel and harissa which I found absolutely delicious. The tuna was perfect. No complaints on this dish.The second course was a seared foie gras with kumquat, rainbow chard, and grilled panettone - also amazing, but foie gras is my all-time favorite food so it's hard to go wrong. The foie gras itself was amazing, the accompaniments unimpressive.The third course was a nova scotia halibut with lentils and crawfish - I didn't like this at all. I found it to be extremely dry and bland. Barely ate half.The fourth course was the beef course and had beef prepared two ways (braised short rib and a NY strip). The strip was yummy, the short rib slightly lacking. This portion size was extremely small.The dessert, unlike what I've found at other Michelin stars, was actually genuinely tasty - a chocolate milk mousse with tonka ice cream and praline crunch. Thumbs up for an oddly accessible and simple dessert.We ordered espresso and a cappuccino at the end of the meal which was brought with a diner-esque selection of packeted sugars/sweeteners - seriously? You couldn't have brought anything nicer? The timing of the meal was good (no major waits between courses) but more amuse bouche throughout would have been nice. Portion sizes were odd - the mains were some of the smaller portions. All in all, this is totally the sort of place I would revisit for restaurant week when you can dine here and drop $42 - a $125 experience?

Wish I could cook salmon this good.Snake river tenderloin: a bit too salty. Still very good. Desert: Lol, I don't remember what we had. Both were good. Server: too young and too inexperienced. She didn't know the menu well and didn't understand our questions. Example: ""is the endive salad pieces of endive with meat/cheese mixture inside each leaf?"" Her answer, ""yes"". It wasn't. It was all mixed together like a normal salad. We smiled. It is Christmas Eve and she is working. I suspect she wasn't a lead server.Service: outstanding BUT one complaint. Multiple servers and hosts were at entrance to kitchen which happened to be right where we were sitting. We had to talk over them as they chatted about their weekend to each other the entire dinner. It was a bit annoying. That said, the service was high end. They were ready with water and plates immediately. I would suggest to the manager to remind them to tone down the chatting while guests are eating.Cost: it wasn't cheap. For that, I think it was a little lower level than what I'd expect at that price range. I likely would not eat here again.

I definitely had a few different choices for my Michelin starred places in New York, but I wanted to be able to get meals so I'd be able to go to all the shows and do work as needed.  The ambiance is what I had expected from a Michelin starred place, but the service was mostly there. It seemed like they were more interested in the other diners at the bar - some business people than me even though I was probably spending just as much as they were. I mean yes, I don't live there and I probably look less professional than they did in jeans in a tshirt, but that doesn't mean I should be treated any differently. Regardless, it should be more about the food anyways. I started off with the pork belly. It was very nicely cooked and paired with some crawfish and asian pear. It cut through the fattiness and was good! The second dish was bell pepper risotto. It had some delicious octopus. Again - seafood kick and it was amazing. Definitely highly suggest.

Despite being inconveniently located in the heart of Times Square, the restaurant feels intimate, and private. We sat directly across from Uma Thurman. Grateful for the three course tasting menu; the foie gras was phenomenal. My date and I tried both preparations and enjoyed the complex, complementary flavors that accompanied each dish. The mains were less memorable. I had the pheasant, which was fine, nothing to write home about. The dessert got me. We were totally full by the time it arrived, but I had a hazelnut chocolate mousse that looked and tasted like a giant whipped truffle.

5.0,10/17/2017,"My first Michelin Star Restaurant in New York and it did not disappoint! I came here for NY Restaurant Week during the summer (3 ppl)! SERVICE/ AMBIANCE: The wait staff were super friendly, yet professional, and very patient while we made our choice of the menu. There was a short wait before our food came out, which is okay since the we were seated by the bar area with a view of the enormous wine cellar.FOOD:The New York Restaurant Week Special was a Two Course meal + Dessert for $29. Starting with our first course, the appetizers among us were the two orders of the Garganelli Pasta w/ Stracciatella and heirloom tomato and one order of Cucumber Gazpacho w/ lovage, crab, andd crème fraîche. The Garganelli was colorful and full of flavor, and the presentation of the Cucumber Gazpacho was mesmerizing. The flavor was very light with a hint of seafood in the taste. Both were a very pleasant start to lunch. Main course had a variety with form stuffed piquillo peppers to veal chops to pan-roasted salmon! We got all of them of course to share! The veal chops was definitely my favorite! Hands down one of the best and most tender veal chop I've ever had! The flavors of every dish were as decadent as they needed to be without over powering the main part of the dish! Very impressive!For dessert, two options of either the chocolate layer cake or the peach melba! One filled with richness and smoothness of chocolate fudge, while the other was the opposite with a fluffy light vanilla ice cream base with fresh peaches and raspberries and crunchy almond tuile to add the finishing touch! I would come back just for this dessert!Thank you for an amazing experience Aureole! Definitely will be back!",0,0,0,Linda L.,"Chicago, IL",272,21,51

3.0,10/12/2017,"This is not an overall killer review except for one - and only one - outstanding feature. The personnel, the service. Gold stars all the way around. From the Manager Maitre'D (who's name I ashamedly have forgotten) to Joe who greeted me along with him as well as worked the busy post 5pm work after whistle crowd at the bar, these guys are great (and yes they cater to the upstairs BofA Corp headquarters crowd VERY well). The food was so-so for the mega $, not what I remembered it to be when Aureole first opened moons ago. These days they offer a dizzying array of eating menu options. They post them outside the entry. They advertise their prix fixe Lunch and Dinner 2-3 Course options and prices per there as well. A lunch prix fixe (I was too late for that) menu, Small Plates menu, tasting dinner menu, a la carte dinner menu, pre-theater prix fixe dinner menu. Dizzying really.  I ate at the Bar early dinner 5pm being party of one, selecting the pre-theater prix fixe (options of 2 or 3 courses differing prices depending on that limited selection, see what I mean dizzying?). NOT a great choice turned out. Here's why:1) The First Course selection was 1of 3. I chose the Garganelli (w veal ragout). It was veal alright, but was tasteless, looked something similar to pet food...'come on Chef we know veal doesn't LOOK like beef but it shouldn't be GRAY mincemeat looking either, lacking seasoning or richness, carrots did not enhance enough. 2) The Second Course selection again 1 of 3. I chose the Double R Ranch Strip Steak, medium rare. Normally easy safe choice. Was good, not outstanding, steak except I would have preferred it come in SLICES across the plate not CHUNKS. But that wasn't the real problem. Real problem is it comes with SMOKED BEETS. Which completely faked smoked quality taste absolutely ruins the dish. Beets do NOT ever need to be (liquid smoke) smoked, period. Heresy. The over fake aroma permeates your nose and taste buds. Stop doing them this way I beg you. Beets are earthy great on their own, minimally dressed (agrodolce would be far better as it compliments beets by nature).3) I did not opt for the third course dessert choice. I would have selected the Strawberry 'something' delight as both online Yelp photo and descrip sounded great.Interestingly, Aureole gets raves for its desserts, not so much the rest. That's a shame.Sum up? VERY overpriced for food quality. Great bar scene, great service/personnel. My guess is their very pricey tasting menu is what they do better than all the rest options. Beware tho, there are better places for the $. 2 glasses wine plus 2 Course Pre Theater menu = $110 w tip. High for the quality.",0,0,0,Mer D.,"Avon by the Sea, NJ",0,10,0

3.0,8/18/2017,"I came to Aureole for lunch today and ordered from the Restaurant Week menu. For my appetizer, I got the Cucumber Gazpacho. This was extremely disappointing. It came with just a tiny dollop of crab meat in the center, and then the waiter poured the gazpacho around it. Personally, I did not like the taste of the gazpacho. It tasted almost ""too healthy,"" if you know what I mean.For the entrée, I ordered the Pan-Seared Salmon. The salmon came with beans and cabbage around it. This dish was very average in quality.The dessert was definitely the highlight of the meal. I got the Chocolate Layer Cake, which also came with a scoop of mixed berry sorbet. The sorbet was super sweet and made for a perfect pairing with the cake, which was chocolatey but not too heavy.Overall, I had very high expectations for Aureole, and I left the restaurant disappointed. Service was decent and the interior design and atmosphere are good. However, the food (apart from dessert) was average in quality. I was actually more impressed with the free soft bread than I was with part of my meal. That is sad. Still, this is not to say that Aureole is a bad restaurant.

2.0,8/13/2017,"My husband and I used to dine here often with our friends before every Roundabout theatre performance. Over the past few times though, it changed, it wasn't really up to par. We've continued to try just in case of an off night or two or three!  The specialty cocktails (I had the green thumb) a winner however even the drink portions are small and the prices are fairly large. As is the wine I by the glass, I might add. The pour was really tiny. We weren't sure if it was because the bottle was empty and perhaps the sommelier was too lazy to go and get another bottle? The glass, $18.00 and wasn't even a quarter pour. We would never say anything but we were disappointed. Typically we order a bottle but I wanted to try the specialty cocktails  and not fall asleep in the theatre! Not exceptional wines by the glass, so if you're a true foodie, you might be disappointed, so I recommend that you indulge in a bottle instead. We considered  the pre-theater menu but the choices were extremely limited so we ordered off the regular menu. Skip the greens. they are just very bland and totally uninteresting. You can do better making this at home. I had the tuna tartare for an app which was good and then the duck breast for main. The duck didn't melt in your mouth, it was rather chewy and the outside was not crispy so yes I was disappointed yet again.  Husband had the salmon. It was good, crispy on the outside and med/rare in the middle. But these were not knock your socks off flavors and mediocre. I wonder if they changed chefs? Anyhow, I think well need to find a theatre ""to go"" place as this one isn't up to par lately. Particularly for the price.

So we sat at a table.We were given menus and our drinks were ordered. I got an Arnold Palmer and the rest of my team got alcoholic drinks. They gave us some bread as well, and the focaccia was everyone's favorite. So soft and delicious (aka buttery)! For my main course, I ordered a shrimp dish and a swordfish dish. Both were quite fresh and prepared well, though I didn't find anything spectacular about either one. I guess they were creative! The shrimp dish had two shrimp on top of a piece of polenta, and there was a creamy, milky sauce to go with it. It was quite tasty, but portions are definitely small! For the swordfish dish, there were grilled bell peppers and eggplant paste on the side, and the swordfish was on top of some rice-like mixture with vegetables; I'm not quite sure what that was. In any case, the outside of the swordfish was nice and crispy, and the inside was chewy. Interesting dish, not too bold of flavors though.After we ate our dishes and were waiting for dessert, we got kicked off our table because it was 1:15. We got put at the bar, and as an apology for kicking us off (which really wasn't our fault, as our food took forever to come out!), they gave us free dessert. It was pretty great!

The ambiance is really cool with modern lighting and the entire wall with wine bottle was a cool functional decoration. The 3-course meal was not so impressive, unfortunately. There were too many diced olives in the soup, creating a weird salty flavor. The pork was unbelievably soft and I liked it but it lacked flavors. The defenders were beautifully assembled but too sweet. I'm not sure if I would come back even with NYC Restaurant Week deal.",2,1,1,Irene M.,"Astoria, Queens, NY",109,210,661
5.0,3/6/2017,"When I travel for work with vendors, especially flavor houses, they always want to take you to the most trendy place and ofcourse I would never say no especially if they're picking up the tab. The choice for the night..  was this Charlie Palmer restaurant. For a Monday night, the place was busy ... ofcourse it's NY. Every night is busy.  Everyone had the chefs tasting menu ofcourse.  I chose the black cod my main entree and foie gras. Both tasted heavenly. Just the perfect portion with the right balance of flavors. In between courses they Chef would offer little tasting and amuse bouche of here and there it was almost like a 7 course meal. Check out all my photos and you will see what I'm talking  about. Service was on point. Fresh bread was served all thought out the night.

4.0,2/18/2017,"Very elegant, clean ambiance with big furniture and high ceilings. We were seated at the dining room further back which seemed quieter and a lot more spacious (Reserve to dine here ahead of time).We came for restaurant week winter 2017, and overall my experience was good. I think there were a couple waiters who had just started out and they would accidentally drop silverware or not know things, but that's ok. Not everyone can be great on their first day!Appetizers: we had the pasta dish and the foie gras. The pasta was cooked perfectly in a tomato sauce and the portions were just right. I don't think I'm a huge foie gras person and the texture of the dish threw me off. Entrees: the beef cheek dish came with mashed potatoes and steamed veggies. The portions were actually big compared to most restaurant week ones. The flavors were very strong and the dish a bit heavy, but we shared both the beef dish and the salmon dish among two, which helped balance it out. The salmon dish wasn't amazing but it wasn't dry either, and unlike the sauce for the beef, the salmon was very light and tender. Dessert: im a HUGE popcorn fan, so the caramel popcorn was great. How can you say no to caramel & ice cream? The berry sorbet came with a funky mousse type of thing that wasn't necessarily my cup of tea, but overall wasn't terrible. I really liked how accommodating they were in terms of whether or not we were on a time crunch for a show or anything. They also did not rush our meal and took time to bring out our courses so I give them 4 stars. I want to try their regular menu as well!",0,0,0,Dan-Ah K.,"Manhattan, NY",561,104,680
3.0,2/17/2017,"My boyfriend and I went to Aureole tonight and both ordered the three-course meal. The two three course meals + 1 beer + 1 coffee was $280 (including tax and 20% tip). The three-course meal consisted of one appetizer, one entree, and one dessert ($95) which means ~$30 per plate...and no the servings were not large at all. (It's been three hours since the meal and my boyfriend and I are already hungry.)I've been to many great restaurants in New York and frankly, this restaurant was very underwhelming for the price, and thus, I felt compelled to leave a review to warn others not to go here unless you just have a ton of money and just care about going to Michelin star restaurants. The atmosphere was lovely, the service was great, and the food was good (minus the beet appetizer). However, there are so many other restaurants (e.g. ABC Kitchen, Avra, Nobu, Gato, Upland, Marea, Babbo, Delaware & Hudson, Tori Shin, etc literally so many!!!) where I can get as nice atmosphere, service, and more food for 50-70% of the price I paid tonight.

Dessert was mandatory (options are 3 course or tasting menu).  Husband is diabetic.  Surprisingly - nothing appealed to me on the dessert list so I joined him in choosing the cheese platter which was excellent.  Overall a great choice.  Went with 4 instead of 5 stars only from a value perspective.   It is on the expensive side ($96 for basic 3 courses no beverage) for size of portion.   Beverages were on the small side for $ spent.    This is not a major complaint because of quality - it's just a bit pricey for an overall five star rating.   But we will be happy to return.,0,0,0,Kim D.,"Piscataway Township, NJ",50,12,1

Boyfriend got a pasta dish which was very homey and nice. Entrees-- beef cheeks were awesome. So tender and melt in your mouth good. Those truffle potatoes were beyond good. I got the salmon which was tasty but did not hold a candle to the beef. Dessert was either the Strawberry Bavaroise or Panna Cotte. Both very tasty and lots of fruit, sweet and delightful.

My husband just said -- as we are on the way home - ""I can still taste the salt. Expected better food and better service. The host told us to wait at the bar while he made sure our 7:45 table was ""perfect"". At about 8:05 someone approached us and asked if we were waiting for a table. We said yes and she said follow me. We gathered up our drinks and followed her. They first seated us next to the waiter station at a table set for 3 (not exactly ""perfect"" for our anniversary celebration). When I said this is next to the waiter station, they offered us banquette seating. There were many open tables. Why seat us at the worst one?   Carpaccio, pear blood orange salad were mediocre - salad very salty. Pheasant was decent. Steak good. Desserts pretty good. Nice treats at the end.

4.0,2/2/2017,"More like 3.5 stars really. It wasn't a horrible experience by any means but when you pay this kind of price for a meal, you expect close to perfection - or at least I do. The service should match the price point. To start, my friend got the Trofie pasta and it was pretty bad. It was EXTREMELY fishy and the pasta was definitely not fully cooked. I had the cauliflower soup and it was ok. The olive tapenade, in my opinion, was overpowering. You will like it if you love black olives. I like my soup quite a bit heavier - this was extremely buttery. For the entree, my friend got the Cabernet braised beef cheeks and it was amazing. I got the fregola and kabocha squash and it was also very good. The dessert was also very good - we both had the strawberry bavaroise. I say 3.5 stars rather than 4 not because of the food but because of the service. Again, it wasn't horrible by any means but when you pay a certain price, you expect extremely attentive service. We sat at the table for close to 5 or 6 minutes before anyone said anything to us. I kept making eye contact with servers trying to make a point that we had not been attended to yet and still it took that long to even get water. The service continued to be a bit slow throughout our meal and we were 2 of maybe 15 people there. Probably would not go back.",0,0,0,Maria C.,"Denver, CO",179,207,5

They also made it sound like someone would escort you through the check-in to the restaurant; instead a staff person stood behind the blockade holding a restaurant sign and we still had to go through the same over-stuffed check-in process. Finally got to the restaurant, where the table we were seated at was directly across the street from a giant flashing billboard; it was so bright I actually developed a full-on, nauseating migraine in the middle of the meal. The food was presented nicely but taste was not nearly as good or very flavorful; expected much higher quality based on reviews.

The restaurant provided party hats, beads and your usual New Years Eve props as well as a glass of champagne to toast to the New Year. The restaurants location is great for this event. They close off the block so that only the patrons of the restaurant were allowed on that block.  We were able to watch the ball drop and the fireworks without all the craziness in Time Square.

2.0,8/25/2016,"Ah, restaurant week. A time for us poor peasants to experience the finer things in life. This led me to try Aureole, amid pictures of fancy bite-sized food and rave reviews from friends. I was at first skeptical of the quality with the restaurant's location in Times Square but decided to give it the benefit of the doubt. However, my experience couldn't have been more disappointing. Maybe because all the restaurant week patrons are demoted to Liberty Room that the quality of food is sub-par. But just based on my restaurant week experience, I will not be going back to try the full menu. Appetizers: My boyfriend and I each ordered something different from the menu so we could try the most amount of things. For starters, we ordered the tuna tartar and the cavatelli pasta. The tuna tartar was bland and depressing. The pasta was just as bland and one-note. Already off to a rocky start. Entrees: We ordered the farro risotto and slow roasted lamb. When I think risotto, I think creamy and luscious and this dish was none of that. The farro was tough and hard to chew after awhile. The dish was just blah and seems unworthy of the caliber of restaurant this is supposed to be. The lamb dish tasted well seasoned and was succulent but nothing to write home about. Desserts: The highlight of the meal was the dessert, which showed a hint of creativity. We ordered the chocolate genoise and the mille-feuille. Both were quite good and very pretty on the plate. Definitely made up a little for the rest of the meal. Service: Maybe because we were seated behind a column, but service was horrendous. It was almost impossible to get the attention of our server every step of the eating out process. Our water glasses was never filled either. Overall, high expectations are met with low quality experience. Guess I should've judged a book by its cover in this case and avoided the restaurants in Times Square.",5,0,1,Aimee X.,"New York, NY",446,85,156
3.0,8/24/2016,"In Liberty Room during restaurant week with some friends. The service was very good but the food was rather disappointing. My friends come here occasionally and mentioned that the meal we shared was one of their 'bad' days. I had their yellowfin tuna tartar...which was quite salty and sour. They probably overdosed on the salt and lemon/lime. However, the sauce and the spiciness were quite tasty regardless of the salty-sourness. The next dish was my main entrée: risotto - most disappointing. I thought my risotto would be softer and more on the savory side, but the texture was like oatmeal/barley my mom would make. It was quite refreshing that risotto is made like this, but doesn't fit my taste buds... If anything, the best meal was definitely saved for last - DESSERT. I got a raspberry chocolate sacher cake. I normally hate how sour sweet raspberry tastes, but the raspberry mixed so well with the chocolate that it was a great balance between your typical bitter sweet chocolate and sour berry. Perhaps I'll come back when I recover from this experience. The only sweet memory I have is that raspberry chocolate cake.",0,1,0,Jiang Min L.,"Brooklyn, NY",76,8,0

Atmosphere, service and food.Although we had the table at 2.15pm, we arrived 10min earlier and we were seated right away.I had Cavatelli and lamb and my husband had salad and risotto. Also, we ordered the extra foie from the regular menu.I must say that all was good and tasty.Foie was as good as expected! Smooth and flavourful!Cavatelli were perfectly cooked al dente and the lamb was to die for! Slow cooked, smooth, soft,  tender and the flavour of the sauce together with te cuscus made the meal.Salad although considered a simple dish, had a tasty citrus dressing and risottoWe had one of each dessert and both of then had wonderful presentation and better taste.I think the menu is a very good value for money.",1,0,0,Monica L.,"Manhattan, NY",27,206,358

3.0,8/18/2016,"Came here for restaurant week particularly since it was a Michelin starred restaurant. Honestly feel the Michelin inspector had an off-night...the place does not deserve a star in my opinion. This is not to say the place is bad; but if you go in there expecting a Michelin guide level meal, you're probably not getting it.Food: To kick things off...they offered some good to excellent breads with cold butter. Cold butter makes no sense to serve. You can't spread it. My starter was the yellowfin tuna. Simply amazing! Well balanced, fresh and offered flavor a that were very complementary. My brother had the cavatelli pasta which was a disappointment and he didn't finish. The texture of the pasta was off. We both had the slow roasted lamb. I wasn't a fan of the lamb but I generally don't like lamb so I could be biased. The cous cous on the dish was excellent though.For dessert I had the chocolate genoise - the flavor was good but there was too much going on in the dish.My brother had the blueberry Mille-feuille. It was good but again the pastry chef had just a lot going on in the dish that it was hard to appreciate. Service: Was good...they are a bit more hands off given that the clientele is generally business folk. However the one thing I did not like was that my brother dropped the butter knife and a server noticed it but did not help. That was just odd. Ambience: high ceiling with a nice wood finish. I hated the spot they gave us as I was looking out onto a digital billboard. It completely distracted from our conversations and I felt I was advertised to for an hour and a half. Additionally it was right by the area the waiters worked. Can't believe they sat us there given the number of other spots available.

We also ordered both deserts on the menu.The pasta was decent but there was far too much of it for a first course. On the other hand, they were very stingy with the calamari so it was just a lot of grains. To be honest the lamb was rather poor and had an awful texture to it. The couscous that was served with the lamb was excellent and was probably the best part of the meal. The deserts were okay as well. The service definitely is not what I'd expect at a michelin star restaurant but still above average.

3.0,8/12/2016,"I came here to try their Restaurant Week lunch menu and I can't say I was impressed, food and service alike. For starters, I got the Cavatelli Pasta and my friend got the Yellowfin Tuna. The pasta was big enough to be an entree. I shared it with a friend and we still couldn't finish it, partly due to the fact that it was heavy too. On the contrary, the Yellowfin Tuna was light and refreshing. For the entree, I got the Poached Hake and my friend got the Slow Roasted Lamb. The Hake (fish) was SO DELICIOUS. I'm usually not a fan of horseradish but it compliments this dish so well! I don't think I would give it up for anything. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this dish. For desserts, I got the Blueberry Mille-Feuille and my friend got the Chocolate Genoise. The Chocolate Genoise was SO SO GOOD, I regret getting the Mille-Feuille. While most chocolate desserts are sweet to the point you'd think you'll get a heart attack, the Genoise was PERFECTION. YOU HAVE TO TRY IT. The Mille-Feuille, on the other hand, was a disaster. Please don't get it unless you like eating tasteless puff pastry that easily falls apart... Not to mention, the mixed berry sorbet tastes like cough medicine. ECK.Other than the Chocolate Genoise, I have no reason to come back to this restaurant. Service was great until most of the staff went on break... We waited an hour for the dessert to come... Not to mention, there was no one left to clear our table or fill our cups...

4.0,8/5/2016,"I came to Aureole - The Liberty Room for Restaurant Week.  And overall my experience was average.  In my opinion the food was ok, not bad, but honestly a little disappointing for a michelin starred restaurant. We had the Tuna Tartare, which was a little tasteless, and the Cavatelli to start.  The Cavatelli and the Lamb dish were actually superb and very flavorful. The Lamb didn't need a knife to cut - it was so soft and tender it I could easily split it apart with my fork.The Hake could have used some serious seasoning - but the snap pea wasabi sauce that came with it was delicious. The desserts were good.  If you are a chocolate or coconut fan I would recommend the Chocolate dessert option (I forget what they called it) otherwise the Blueberry dessert is also a great lighter in flavor option. (The mixed berry sorbet was delicious) What truly impressed me here was the service.  The waitstaff is truly amazing and accommodating.  The waitstaff is what gave this review 4 stars instead of three.  They turned my ho-hum food experience into a great overall dining experience. Also a good note is that the wine list at this restaurant is BEYOND huge.  I would have assumed that they have every wine you could even think of - over 25 pages of wine options!

4.0,7/30/2016,"Joining the army of new york foodies during restaurant week, I ventured out to times square area to look for this Michelin one star restaurant on a friday night (oh boy the traffic and crowd were insane at times square!) Arriving at the restaurant around 8pm, I was overwhelmed by the sheer number of asian customers at the restaurant. If it were not for the decor of the restaurant, I'd have thought I went to a Chinese restaurant instead. I didn't wait for long before getting seated by the bar and being presented the same restaurant week menu as did people sitting at the table. The $42 prefix dinner includes two courses and one dessert for you to choose from three categories. I chose Yellowfin Tuna for my first course, Farro Risotto for the second course and Chocolate Genoise as dessert. Before your food arrives, feel free to ask your waiter/waitress to bring you some bread with butter if you're starving as I was. The presentation of all the dishes was spectacular, each one looking better than the previous one. When it comes to tastes, I liked the first course Yellowfin Tuna, which tasted very fresh and flavorful. With  thinly-sliced cucumbers laid around the pink tuna, the dish definitely created a palatable color combination that seemed appetizing. I was slightly disappointed by the second dish Farro Risotto because I was expecting the fish to be much more fresh and tender. I would recommend that you order Slow Roasted Lamb if you have a high standard for fish quality as I do. My friend who ordered slow roasted lamb shared some of his lamb with me; the lamb was amazing: tender, juicy and flavorful! I was not too impressed by the dessert; it was alright.

5.0,7/29/2016,This review is for restaurant week!! First course: Summer greens. Yellowfin tuna. Cavatili Pasta. The summer greens was surprisingly good. They have a good sauce that comes with it. Also a hefty portion. Tuna was delish. A smaller portion but good raw tuna ceviche type dish. The cavatili pasta has a strong pesto flavor.Second course: Purple Hake. Risotto. Slow cooked lamb. Hake is a fish on a bed of taro. More of a lighter palate. Risotto was interesting. Had a strong base of goat cheese and zucchini. The lamb is rich and savory. The couscous that came with it was yummy and rich in flavor too!Dessert: blueberry Mille-fueille. Chocolate genoise. The Mille-fueille wasn't what I was expecting. Thought it was going to be a thousand layer crepe cake but it was more of a thin flakey sandwich with Creme in the middle. I loved the genoise! It's mostly a chocolate dessert with coconut sorbet!,2,1,0,Tanya Z.,"New York, NY",393,356,624
1.0,7/28/2016,"Extremely disappointing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I had dinner Aureole last night and I experienced the absolute worst service of my life!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!I work within the hospitality industry and i have my BT and MMH in hospitality management so I know a thing or two about the restaurant industry.  I have been to other restaurants of this caliber before and each of the meals I had I will remember for the rest of my life for all the right reasons. The meal at I had at Aureole on the other hand,I will always remember for all the wrong reasons. The food it's self was ok at best. But the service was really where my experience soured. The section of the restaurant where we were seated in was the private dinning room which is completely segregated for the rest of the restaurant. We where placed there deliberately due to the fact that we decided to dine at Aureole for restaurant during week. After being seated we waited over an hour to order cocktails. To add insult to injury we where carded multiple times by the captain how first asked us if we where of age. He then proceeded to ask us for our ID's anyways. After ordering our drinks we waited an additional 45 minutes before our drinks arrived at the table. After the two hour mark the captain finally acknowledged our existence again and took out order. In addition to our meal my party decided to order a bottle of wine that is when we where carded again even though we already had drinks on the table and the captain saw our ID's. It took a additional 30 minutes for out fist course to arrive. It wasn't until the second course that our wine was brought to the table. The som was the only redeeming factor about the service. However the captain detracted for the wine service when I ordered the wine. I requested that the bottle be served with the first course but it was not fired until we where half way into the second course. To make matters even worse The captain also responded to my request and questions about the wine in a very condescending manner while blatantly ignoring my request. After our we finished our third course we waited an additional half an hour to have a plates cleared if that wasn't bad enough we where ignored for an additional 20 minutes before we receive the check. And at lest another additional 10 minutes to get our cards back. Although our meal should have lasted about 2 hours at most. But due the the inexcusable wait and lack of care by the captain our ordeal lasted over 3 and a half hours!!! If you as a restaurant are participating in restaurant week you should try to provided all of your guest with a truly memorable experience rather then banishing them to a corner of the restaurant and ignoring them just due to the fact they they went to your restaurant for the restaurant week tasting menu. If it is such a inconvenience for you to participate in restaurant week then simply do everyone a favor and do not ask to be added to that list. You will be saving a lot of people for a extremely disappointing and excessively long meal. In addition if this is how you treat all of your guests I don't think you will be on business for much longer. And I don't know who you bribed for your michelin star but I can tell you this Aureole you are definitely not worthy of such a prestigious reward. I would give this review negative stars however that is not a option, but this was with out a doubt the worst service and most disappointing meal I have ever experienced!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",4,1,1,Menachem P.,"Hewlett, NY",83,1,0

3.0,7/1/2016,"I'll start by saying the food is superb. We had the yellow fin tuna tartare, the lobster and the strawberry mille fuelle. The prosecco was average. The review is more of a reflection of the interaction over the phone and the layout of the restaurant. I called for a same day reservation to take my father on a surprise dinner to Aureole as it was just the two of us in town and wanted to treat him. A reservation was made and upon arrival to the restaurant we were sat in a front room. I had a shared booth/couch seating while my father sat in the opposite chair. No tablecloth, no floral arrangement. The place where I sat had crumbs and the couch was ripped. As it was summer and I was wearing a dress the crumbs got on my legs and was very uncomfortable. The couch was sinking and not good quality. I noticed there was a separate room in the back that appeared to have tablecloth. I inquired about the separate room and was told that was a separate reservation. My intention was to get a reservation at the Michelin Starred portion of the restaurant but was automatically without any indication over the phone given a reservation in the more casual (and overall inadequate) Liberty Room. After crossing the threshold into the proper dining room (they had seating available for two) which was way smaller than the Liberty Room, the service immediately went from 2 star to 5 star. I've been to the more casual portions of restaurants (Gramercy Tavern, Daniel) before with appropriate seating and proper service. This Liberty Room was a sore disappointment. These need to be separated into two different restaurants as one is a 2 star restaurant and the other is a 5. You feel as if you're walking through another restaurant to get to the restaurant which is awkward. The small size of the dining room makes me feel like the restaurant is trying to monopolize on the name and surreptitiously making people reservations in the Liberty Room. Unlikely to return again unless dad craves the food again as it is superb.",2,1,1,Natasha B.,"San Francisco, CA",9,143,1
1.0,6/29/2016,"If there was a way to give -stars, I would do that.For a high end restaurant that has earned a Michelin star, I had certain expectations.  But to be clear, those expectations were pretty basic.  That I would have good service.  That my food would be good tasting.  That I would have SILVERWARE.  But alas, none of this came to pass.I booked a reservation with much excitement.  I was bringing my mom to NYC for the first time in her life!!  We were going to dinner and a SHOW!  It was all very exciting!!  So, I booked a 5:30pm reservation with theater tickets at 7 pm.  I told the restaurant I had theater tickets for 7 pm when I booked the reservation, they confirmed that I had 7 pm tickets when they called to confirm my reservation, the hostess confirmed my 7 pm theater tickets when I was seated AND my waitress confirmed my 7 pm theater tickets when she presented us the menus.  So.  Everyone in the entire establishment knew I had 7 pm theater tickets.  Meaning I had to leave NO LATER THAN 6:45 pm.After being seated our waitress disappeared for a solid 15 minutes.  No drink order, no order of any kind.  By the time she came back, we were ready.  We ordered from the specified ""pre-theater menu"" thinking to ourselves, ""This will be great!  Three courses and they will be fast because this is the special early theater menu so it will be great food and pretty fast.""  We both ordered the asparagus soup.  It came out pretty quickly but we don't have spoons.  I asked someone to bring us spoons, he says ""of course!"" and then disappears.  I try frantically to find someone to bring us spoons.  No one.  5 minutes pass.  The soup looks amazing but it's getting cold.  We eventually turn to forks to stab some of the pieces in the soup.  Finally, I managed to flag someone down and we get spoons.  Soup was delicious but was not as hot by this point so that was a bit disappointing.  The goat cheese should have melted into the hot soup making it creamy all over...had I a spoon.  But instead it stayed there in a glob being less amazing than it should have been.Fine.  Soup was good.  Surely the next course will be better?!  You guessed it, NO.  My mom got the salmon which she said was nice.  I got the steak.  It was quite a tough piece, white gristle clearly visible throughout the cut.  And I only had a butter knife!  I couldn't cut it no matter how hard I wrestled it around on my plate.  Again, I'm looking around, praying to find someone to bring me a steak knife.  No luck.  I'm about to give up on this steak when I finally flag someone down across the restaurant and I get a steak knife.  OK.  By this point we are so behind schedule.  I'm looking nervously at my watch, looking for dessert.  It does not show.  I get my credit card out, anxious not to miss the show I paid so much for.  The waitress appears.  She takes my card and runs it.  No dessert.  She brings it back with the full amount and leaves!!!  I wait for her to come back (no dessert) and say, ""I'm sorry but I'm not paying for food that I didn't get!"".  She says, ""Well, I'm sorry, I put the order in.""  I ask her politely to take the dessert charge off my bill.  She has to get a manager.  They finally take it off my bill.  No apology.  The manager that helps her does not come over and talk to us.  We leave (dessert never having made an appearance) at 6:45 and rush the 6 blocks to the theater.  It was a TERRIBLE and STRESSFUL experience and the food wasn't even that good (what I had of it)!  I highly suggest you look elsewhere for food options in the neighborhood.  This place was a nightmare experience and I certainly don't wish that on anyone!!",0,1,0,Melodie B.,"Nashville, TN",0,14,0

You can't order a la carte, but you needn't worry as every course has a fabulous selection to suit every palate.  An amuse bouche and additional petit fours complete the meal.  Servings are just nice so it leaves room for each subsequent course without making you feel too full so that you can't enjoy the progression.  The only tiny tiny issue is that it is located right in the middle of the Times Square/Broadway throng so it is a pain to get to on foot and taxi, but the benefit of course is that it is a really fine choice for a special dinner before you catch one of the very special performances on Broadway. Would definitely come back.  5:30pm service is just nice without rushing you...all courses are served promptly and you can leave by 7:20pm to walk to your show.  They even ask you when they call to confirm your reservation if you are seeing a show - so thoughtful!",0,0,0,Moon G.,"Sydney, Australia",0,31,1
5.0,6/17/2016,"WHOoo! Came here for year end celebration with team. We definitely made the weight decision.Atmosphere:We have 7 people, so we are reserved to dine in the main dinning room, which is smaller than I though, probably can only fit 40 people Maximum. And they only offer prix menu ($98 for three courses) , $125 for 5 courses or chef tasting menu for $148. If you want t order a la carte, the you have to sit in lounge.Bread:Before I forgot, my colleague want me to make sure give them credit for their excellent bread selections, forgot the name of his favorite bread name, but he said it was very good!Food:We decided to to the three courses, because for the five courses, you don't get to pick which dishes you like, everything is settled already. For three courses menus, you can pick one from appetizer, one for main entree, and then finished with a dessert. Seared Hudson valley foie gras: ( $10+ supplements)Foie gras was HUGE! I had been eating foie gras in so many restaurants, and this one was definitely stand up among many of them, consider of big portion ( fist size) , the texture still remain constant and tasted very smooth. I like the first bite of foie gras, it was a blasted. However, when it come to the end, the taste kind of getting heavy and you know you have enough. Poached lobster:($10 supplements)I think lobster sauce helped this dished a lot, lobster was very fresh, I believed it was whole lobster. Lobster meat was well cooked, not too dry, the juicy and tenderness was right in the spot. Dessert:We order most of the dessert to share, sorbet and gelato was very decent, so many flavors. Strawberry(forgot the name）， was very decent, I think the presentation of dessert very impressed me, and surprise me at some point. Because most of the restaurant dessert menu was very okay. In conclusion, I think Aureole desired a Michelin starred restaurants. In terms of price, 118( 20 dollar supplements) is little pricey for three course. If they didn't charge that extra bucks, i will think this is good choice. Maybe 125 for five course is better deal for most of you.",1,0,0,Enci C.,"Flushing, Queens, NY",54,95,378

There was limited options of wines by the glass so we went for a bottle. 80 for most wines, I this day and age, there should be more options in the 50 to 60 range.Food was optional ala caret or pre dinner menu. 3 went ala crate and I went pre theatre. We had a salad, and 2 of us had the tuna tar tar. All was good, the tuna a bit small. For dinner we had 2 salmons, a steak, and a cod. All was very good.The service was pretty bad.

For dessert, the raspberry chocolate sacher cake was to die for.Dad had the foie gras, liked it but thought it was too sweet (like strawberries) didn't taste like foie gras at all. He also had the Pork Chop as a main dish which was also delicious. Followed by the apricot tart which was a crowd favorite. Service was impeccable and they even gave us unlimited bread, complimentary soup before the appetizers and a complimentary cookie tray and cookie goodie bag to take home!!

Now for the food...my wife started with the asparagus soup and had the pork chop for an entree. I had the cavatelli as a starter and the dry aged NY strip. The presentation of the food was top notch. The flavors were very good but we weren't blown away by the food, especially with our expectations after hearing the name Charlie Parker and the words Michelin star. We've had some better meals in NYC. Again the food wasn't bad or even average...but we may have set high expectations for ourselves. Or perhaps they put more attention to the food in the Dining Room.

5.0,5/27/2016,"Let me begin by saying: Get the tasting menu and let the everyone take care of you. All of the staff is extremely good at their jobs from the hostesses, bartenders, servers, and based off the food obviously the entire kitchen staff. The tasting menu is obviously pretty up there in price but you definitely get your money's worth with the entire experience. Each course is presented to you by multiple servers, and each ingredient is described from where it is sourced- to how it was used in the dish. If you opt to pay for the wine pairings, the sommelier will present a different wine with each course. The tasting menu is a great way to sample a lot of things you wouldn't want to miss if you saw them on the menu at other restaurants: seared foie gras, filet mignon, tartare, etc. Between the food, beautiful dining areas and service (and hopefully the company you dine with), Aureole makes for a very memorable time.",3,2,2,Michael T.,"Montclair, NJ",53,108,16

I am vegetarian, they did sauted veggies for main, with a giant mashed potato in the center, which wasnt much to talk of. A restaurant of its caliber should make an effort with a vegetarian main, esp one with protein, instead of a giant potato in the center. The cavatatelli was very good but too oily and carby to be consumed in bigger quantity as a main.   The service at lunch hour was very slow and the place was noisy, so I wont repeat a business lunch there, esp on the big round table in the center. They were slow to bring all courses, drinks, clear the table. Cracked pepper arrived half way into the meal for a few of us.

4.0,5/11/2016,"I took my mom here for the prix fixe Mother's Day brunch and it was a huge hit! Unlike typical prix fixe menus, there were tons of different options for every type of palate. I was a little miffed that we (and everyone else who had reservations for 11:45AM) had to wait around for 10-15 minute while they completed setting up the dining area, so we ended up not being seated until around 12PM. I thought the point of making reservations was so that this wouldn't be a problem. Good thing we had no plans following brunch. For our appetizers, we ordered the white asparagus soup and the whitefin tuna tartare. Both were excellent options. The soup was creamy and tasted almost like seafood chowder The tuna tartare was super fresh and nicely marinated in a light dressing of soysauce? and sesame oil. I particularly enjoyed the vegetable topping which was dusted with a light chili paste and tasted like fresh kimchi. For our main courses, we ordered the steak with potatoes and the lobster benedict. I really enjoyed the lobster benedict. It was definitely way too much food for one person - which the server did warn me about before I ordered it - so I was glad that I shared it with my mom. In addition to the lobster (I think all together it was a full lobster bc I had two half tails and two claws), I also got a little cut of steak. The steak was a bit bland, and was more a medium rare than a rare, which I'd asked for, but I rolled it around in my mom's steak sauce and it was fine. My mom found her steak, which had a salt and pepper crust, to be a little too salty. Otherwise, her steak was cooked to a perfect medium.Things really went downhill for dessert though, like straight off a cliff downhill. I ordered the red velvet cake and my mom had the raspberry chocolate cake. Mine was almost inedible. Considering the prestige of the restaurant, I was surprised that the dessert was so unpalatable. It also tasted like they'd made it way in advance and just thawed it out for the day. My mom was equally unimpressed with her dessert.I thought service was a little dismissive, but they were really busy on Mother's Day, so I think that can be overlooked. All moms got a small bottle of sparkling red wine after the meal which was a nice touch!",2,1,2,Sherry L.,"San Francisco, CA",893,1172,889

My entree was not good, as was my moms. I understand the menu was a special price for Mother's Day, but when you're dining at a fine restaurant you expect great food and excellent service.

My appetizer of pasta with ricotta, veal, ramp, and wax beans was very good, but the main course of poached halibut had an accompaniment that was too heavy on lemon and overpowered the delicate fish. Poached fish is also not the most attractive thing to set on a plate, so the look of the dish as a little off too since it wasn't dressed up very attractively. The staff were very accommodating, but the drinks and courses were pretty slow to come out. The room is also kind of loud, with all the hard surfaces, and the décor is bland for my taste.

3.0,4/22/2016,"The flavorings of the food and the presentation were excellent, however there were some surprising issues worth pointing out. 1st Course: Ricotta Cavatelli Pasta - Excellent flavor, portion size, and presentation.  The veal was incredibly tender and the pasta was cooked well.  My only complaint about this was that the meal was way over salted.  The seasoning stood on their own so there was no reason for it to be so salty.Main: Leg of Lamb Special - 3 thick cut pieces of lamb so it was a good portion size. They were seasoned well with just the right amount of vegetables.  The problem was that they were  very tough to cut and chew.  They should have provided a steak knife for this dish.  Lamb really should not be that tough and chewy.  I've had much better at far cheaper restaurants.Dessert: Sticky Toffee Pudding - Tasted great and would definitely get again if I return.  I only wish there was more of the whiskey ice cream as it was only a couple small spoon fulls.  Service: The waiter did a great job of helping me pick a wine for the table and they helped answer any questions the other guests had about the menu.  Once the food was brought though they seemed to disappear completely and not really check in on how the meal was going.

It was a much different experience this time. The host was friendly and seated us immediately. I had made a 5:30 reservation, plenty of time to make it to our show at 8. The waiter started off asking if we were seeing a show and what time, which I appreciated (plus he said we'd have plenty of time). We chose wine and placed our order. Everything was going well until they brought our entrees and mine was not what I ordered. They were going to leave my husband's plate on the table until he told them he wasn't going to start without me. Good thing he sent it back to be kept warm, because it was another 20-30 minutes before my correct entree came out. Dessert was slow to come out too. What bothered us more than anything was the complete lack of concern from the wait staff that we had to wait so long for them to correct their mistake. No apologies were given and our waiter avoided eye contact while we were waiting. The food was good, but not good enough to make up for the service.

One of our guests asked the server if her daughter could order a la carte and was told no.  We were not told there was a different dining room or asked if we could be re-seated.  Overall, nice location and some lovely food selections, but sadly the service put a damper on what should have been a lovely evening.",0,0,0,Kerry G.,"Livermore, CA",0,5,0

2.0,3/16/2016,"Gluten-Free ReviewGluten-Free Patrons Look Elsewhere Let's get one thing straight, the food here is 5 star and worthy of a King. However my review is solely based on the service, accommodations, and what I was told on the phone prior to booking for a gluten-free (allergy) patron such as myself.I wanted to take my family to a Michelin starred restaurant while on our trip to NYC and decided to look over the 30+ spots to hit up, this one has been around a long time so I wanted to see what there game level was like. I called prior to making reservations and asked if they make accommodations to gluten-free people and she told me they had to ask the chef and call me back, I never received a phone call back and finally called back 3 hours later. They told me yes they can make accommodations for gluten and I asked if it was leaving items off the entree or actually substitute certain items, they told me they substitute certain features. As a YELP review before said they just left items off, I was very adamant about this. The restaurant is beautiful on the inside, and we were quickly seated once arrived, we all 4 ordered the Tasting menu and had a few cocktails from the bar. It took about 5-7 minutes before any server acknowledged us at our table which we were kinda shocked about, and told them of my allergy and they were aware. The service here was sub-par for this caliber of restaurant, took time to get them to refill our water, took about 10 minutes to make one cocktail drink every time I ordered one, and was not as awesome as $18 should be. The reason for two stars: Entirely screwed me on the whole substitution thing with gluten-free, instead of making gluten free waffles for the first course, they left the waffle off, informing me they do not have gluten-free bread (WTF?!). On every tasting menu item instead of placing something on there they just left the item off (even though I still paid full price for it). The final straw was they brought out the dessert with all wheat sprinkled over the dish and I was like are you serious, this is suppose to be top of the top, it took another 10 minutes for them to re make this dish and bring it back gluten-free after my family finished theirs. Thanks Aureole for ruining my $700 dinner night and making me regret my choice, if you don't substitute for gluten-free people tell me, and please work on your service with helping patrons with allergies.

I picked another place and my coworker picked this place: I got 3 votes and he got 4. I'm glad we ended up coming here.  The bar area would be a great place for a date with its magnificent chandelier and flattering lighting, but I digress... FOOD: -Tuna Tartare: This was generously portioned. The tuna was fresh and the presentation was gorgeous. 4/5. -Short Rib: This was really delicious. A cut (usually a tougher part of the cow) cooked so tender that I did not really need to cut into it. I substituted the barley that came with the preparation for brussel sprouts, which was pretty good as well. 4.5/5. -Grilled Pineapple with sorbet: I must say I laughed at someone else's (negative review) stating that this restaurant comes from the cooking school of keep adding ingredients. A piece of pineapple, a dot of sorbet, and a tiny macaroon? Picking two out of the three and making it stronger would have been a better choice than what feels more like the kitchen sink (no pun intended). I would have personally liked more of the sorbet. 3/5. My coworker's peanut butter chocolate mousse looked more like a 4 or 5 star item though! SERVICE: Service was pretty good but could have been more attentive considering they weren't that swamped at 2PM. However, the coat check was a nice touch. VERDICT: Beautiful space and pretty good food. Stick to the more traditional standbys (steak, pasta, seafood, etc.) and beware of anything that sounds too try-hard to be trendy (e.g., pineapple with a hint of sorbet and a sprig of macaroon and a dusting of graham cracker AND ...).

Great drink , to my liking, made with the finest of bourbons.Started with the Kabocha Squash Soup (butternut squash, shellfish tortellini).  So good! Followed by the Alaskan Black Cod, surved with Bok Choy, Baby Turnip, Pickled Pearl Onion, Yuzu Dashi Vinaigrette.  Ended the meal with the Pear Belle Hélène , Almond Nougatine, ""Nyangbo"" Chocolate, Vanilla Gelato.  All this was nicely paired with a great glass of Calfornia Chardonnay.A little on the expensive side but definitely  worth it if you happen to be in the area, Bryant Park,especially if you enjoy sitting back and watching all the wonderful New Yorkers doing their thing.",1,1,1,Dominic M.,"Markham, Canada",25,111,313

3.0,2/4/2016,"Restaurant week review. Ordered a dirty vodka martini, this is my standard drink wherever I go.  And it's a drink that that can save my entire day or can be disappointing. My drink was like 80% vermouth, 20% vodka and not dirty at all. I thought it was odd but as I had a long day and my brain was tired I figured it was just me until I nibbled on an olive in the drink. OH MY GOD. It tasted like the olive had been stored in a perfume bottle. I chugged water to get the taste out of my mouth.I ordered wine. And the Cab Franc was phenomenal. Really, really good. But that cocktail was the worst I have ever had in my life.Yellow tail tartare. - with jimica and cucumber and creme fraiche ( I think at least) The acid in the tartare was mandarin orange and there was not enough of it. It tasted too fishy to me. And I usually love fish tartare. Braised short ribs - wonderful. Not over the moon. But what I was expecting for the reputation on the restaurant.Roasted pineapple - It was good. Delicious, however a pineapple is fibrous. I needed a knife. I really struggled to eat this. In conclusion a disappointing experience that was saved by the phenomenal wine. The waiter was great too. I felt bad that the drink was so bad I couldn't drink it. He took it off the bill without me asking which I thought was appropriate.Overall a mediocre experience. I'm unlikely to go back. I use restaurant week as a screening tool to try out new restaurants.

5.0,2/4/2016,"Another Restaurant Week hit! I always walk by this place as I'm going home from work and never thought much of it until I stumbled upon their restaurant week dinner menu.  The place looks gorgeous and upscale from the pictures but in person, it's even more beautiful and quite romantic. My friends and I got seated in the Liberty Room, which is a very cozy dining area in the back of the restaurant. You almost feel secluded from the rest of the restaurant which faces the bustling streets of Bryant Park/Times Square. For me, it was a good escape. We made reservations for an early dinner and we were really the only table in the room.  The service was excellent and I like that they kept the bread coming. For appetizer, I ordered the Yellowfin Tuna tartare, which was married with bonito cream and minced cucumber, which gave a very contrasting and fresh flavor. For main course, I got the braised short rib, which was excellent to the point where the meat just melted in your mouth. Portion-wise, they were also very generous because I couldn't even finish it. Finally, the dessert was the peanut butter crunch chocolate mousse cake. It came in a perfectly thin slice, which made you feel less guilty about finishing it. But the best thing was it wasn't too sweet.  Overall, it was a lovely dining experience and would love to come back and try out their regular menu.",1,1,1,Rowena Y.,"Brooklyn, NY",480,1179,549

Some people might complain about the size of the foods, but I think it was perfect for me. I had a salad for appetizer and Risotto.. The salad was pretty good, but the Risotto was too salty.. I had one bite and couldn't eat more... When the waitress asked me how was everything, and I said everything is good except the Risotto is so salty that i can't eat.. and she just smiled and walked away... haha ..I think the short rip that my friend got was much better. As a dessert, I got Warm chocolate ganache. It was great ! not too sweet, was perfect !

2.0,1/28/2016,"I went here yesterday for restaurant week. I ordered the Garganelli Pasta as the first course. I guess my table was the closest one to the entrance because it was cold. It taste okay, just like any Bolognese style pasta. I ordered the Braised Short Rib as my main course. It had pearl barley on the side and the texture was slimey and taste bland. The short rib did not taste good. It was salty on the outside but tasteless on the inside. The meat was not tender. I normally dont waste food especially when I paid 38 dollar before tips for it but I couldn't even finish it. For dessert, I ordered the Peanut Butter Crunch. The dessert was the highlight of my dinner and even that was too sweet for me. It had ice cream on the side. I just dont understand why my pasta was cold but they couldn't keep the ice cream from melting almost all the way. I personally dont feel that this place is worth one Michelin star. It could be my taste buds but my five other friends feel the same. The atmosphere is mediocre, extremely loud and I have to disagree with the dressy dress code.

My tuna tartare and short rib were delicious, but I think dessert was the best part - it was some caffeinated masterpiece that they served us because my friend is allergic to both peanuts and pineapple, which featured in both of the available options. My friend also had their signature passion fruit drink - it reminded me of orange peach mango juice so I enjoyed that. Great service but the atmosphere is a little weird - neon lights from Times Square filter into the restaurant and it's kind of distracting.",1,0,0,Gab G.,"New York, NY",208,1651,5011

5.0,1/27/2016,"Came here for restaurant week. It was what I would expect a restaurant to be during this hellish week for waiters and cooks alike. We arrived on time for our reservation and had to wait a few minutes before being seated. This place was packed. Despite that we were accommodated pretty well. The wait staff were excellent and quick to refill our bread and water without us needing to ask. A+ work for such a busy night. Onto the food. I had looked at the menu and pictures prior to coming here. My main concern was ""that doesn't look like a lot of food...""  Let me clear that up for anyone who is thinking the same. The food is enough to make you feel full and satisfied. Not overly stuffed but definitely up there. You shouldn't be eating until you're overly stuffed anyway! The portions aren't small. They are just set on large plates. The food we received was on a pre-fixe for restaurant week in itself. We both went for different plates to try each other's food. For my starter I got the yellowfin tuna tar tare. The sauce on the bottom really brought out the flavor in the dish. I was sad this portion was not as big as I'd hoped. Still satisfied! The main dish was the braised short rib. This thing was so good! The meat fell apart so easily and had so much flavor. I was in heaven. Lastly dessert. I had mint tea and peanut butter crunch. The peanut butter crunch was plated beautifully. The gelato that it came with complemented the peanut butter bar so well. As for the tea, it was steeped well and refreshing to drink after the sweet dessert. My only problem was the teapot left behind to pour more tea is designed poorly. The handle is metal and rests against the metal pot. So if you want to pour more tea the handle is too hot to hold. I had to use my napkin to pour more tea. All in all I was completely satisfied for a mini splurge on an excellent 3 course meal. I would definitely come back for an anniversary.

3.0,1/24/2016,"Good place for dinner! Came for restaurant week and had a good experience. Their service was good though a little rushed. The hostess brought us the dessert menu instead of the dinner menu but the server was apologetic for it. They also brought us our check as we were still eating our desserts which seemed like they were pushing for us to leave. Our meal was good though. I got the tuna tartar which was ok but nothing spectacular. Their braised short rib was pretty good and the portion was a decent amount which I appreciated from a pricey restaurant. It had nice parts of fat making it flavorful but some parts were too dry. Their peanut crunch dessert was also good. They also had a good deal for wine where $38 gives you a nice bottle of wine enough for 6 glasses. (Mind you, a restaurant sized glass of wine). The downside would be the location. It's so close to Times Square that you still have the unflattering glare of the billboard advertisements, which detracts from the ambiance. For being a one Michelin star, I had higher expectations especially when lined up with the taste of food at comparable michelins.

For the main course I had the short ribs which were braised to perfection and the fat rendered just right. The meat was dog succulent and intensely flavorful. The portion was more than generous. Overall I was thoroughly satisfied. My friend had the poached salmon which was well seasoned and moist.

Highly recommend the Focaccia. He was the one guy I could depend on. Props to you, bread guy.The RW menu was had a great selection. The portion sizes were VERY impressive.

It as a bit over cooked, but still good.The short rib - also pretty good but again, overcooked.The pineapple dessert - real delicious and sweet.The presentation for all the food was real nice.My biggest gripe with this place was how long it took to get dishes.I have a feeling there was an issue in the kitchen because I overheard TWO tables complain about how slow the food service was.I knew what I wanted when I came in an ordered as soon as possible. I timed it, it took me 1 hour and 15 minutes to complete my 3 course RW lunch.Lets be serious.

4.0,1/20/2016,"I was skeptical about going to a pricier restaurant practically in Times Square, as I expected it to be an overpriced and underwhelming tourist trap. I was very pleasantly surprised. It was a great choice for restaurant week. The food, service, and ambience were very nice. They bring a delicious basket with focaccia, multigrain, and French breads that they aren't hesitant to refill. For the first course I had garganelli pasta (veal ragout, Parmesan, broccoli rabe pesto). The pasta was perfectly al dente and the sauce was basically a light bolognese. The veal ragout was the base so you didn't taste the Parmesan or pesto very much. I might have liked a little more of those flavors, but it was still very good. The portion was quite large too. It would have been a second course at some other restaurants. For the second course I had the braised short rib. The large chunk of meat was so tender it melted in your mouth. The barley that accompanied it was nothing to rave about but it served as a good compliment to the meat. For dessert I had the peanut butter crunch dessert. A very thin layer of chocolate cake over a layer or crispy chocolate (almost like a wafer in a candy bar) was served alongside small dollops of peanut butter sauce. It was a tasty, light final course.",1,0,0,Jamie M.,"Glen Rock, NJ",1,22,20
4.0,1/19/2016,"Aureole was definitely one of my favorite lunch experiences for restaurant week. The restaurant is gorgeous, elegant, and a modern design with warm lighting and beautiful glass wine display. Staff was friendly, attentive, and professional, adding to the pleasant dining experience. Although from one course to the next, I felt food did take a while to arrive, but we weren't rushed and the timing was just right to enjoy, relax, and prepare yourself for the next plate of flavors. From the restaurant week menu:Appetizer:Yellow Fin Tuna Tartare (Jicama, Bonito Cream, Cucumber) - the bonito cream was too citrusy in flavor, didn't really enhance the tuna itself. I liked the texture and freshness of the jicama and cucumber. Entree:Braised Short Rib (Pearl Barley, Horseradish, Watercress) - subtle and delicious sauce over the perfectly cooked and flavorful short rib. I had an excellent cut, but my boyfriend's was 50% chunk of fat :( Nevertheless, the flavor was so delicious and seeped well into the nice and fluffy barely. This dish is heavy for lunch and the portion size was so huge, we took leftovers back home to gladly eat later.Dessert (got to taste both):Vanilla Roasted Pineapple (Coconut Macaron, Mango Lime Sorbet) - after the braised short rib, this one really hit the spot! Unfortunately, this was my boyfriend's pick so I couldn't devour the whole thing myself. The mango lime sorbet was heavy on the mango which I really liked. The pineapple was light on the vanilla but so deliciously roasted to be warm and sweet. Peanut Butter Crunch (Chocolate Mousse, Cream Gelato) - figured you couldn't go wrong with peanut butter anything but this one wasn't as satisfying after the short rib because the peanut butter thick and heavy in texture and flavor. I loved how well the crunch worked with the dark creamy and soft chocolate mousse though. Everything was beautifully plated and the flavors were all creative and different from what I've had.

It came with brussels sprouts which were a little spicy for me but the mushrooms were really good. It also had s butternut squash purée which I could have done without.

It has been difficult to get a reservation on short notice over the years.  At a business dinner for 10, nothing bad to say about the food.  Small quantities but beautifully presented with plenty of room for desert. Desert is needed as the alternative would be a slice of pizza elsewhere to finish the meal. We sat in the back room and given the din in the front room, warm and stuffy was preferable to speaking over the noise. The only real drawback was also mentioned in another review, slow service. Given that they are fully reserved to know in advance the wait staff needed, dinner still took 3 hours of which 1 hour was waiting time due to slow service.  About a 1/4 hour wait to take the initial drink and food orders, then another 1/4 hour for plates to be removed. Slow plate removal is so rarely experienced it stood out. It took so long for the check to be presented after all food and wine was consumed, our hosts allowed us to leave.

4.0,12/5/2015,"Aureole has become one of my favorite places for business lunches/dinners.  I've been here 4x in the past month now, and I plan to return in the next week or so with more clients!  They serve delicious food with the option to do a very reasonable prix fixe.  When I came with a group of 10, we did dinner prix fixe for $96/person before gratuity & tax.  For drinks, they have a great selection of wine and I found their use of Chinese bronze(?) teapots to be a nice touch, albeit a bit out of the place since it's not a Chinese restaurant.  Gorgeous space that has light winter decorations that are classy and not overwhelming. I recommend sitting in the front room with the lofty ceilings than the stuffier back room.Here's what I loved from lunch- Yellowfin tuna tartare was very light and easily a table favorite- Fois gras terrine was rich/decadent.  I probably didn't need an entree after this... and I probably could have shared. - Kabocha squash soup was perfect for on a cold day- Braised beef was exactly as you'd want it to be: tender with great sauce pairing.I loved everything from the dinner prix fixe, but the standouts were the salad (apps), free range chicken (Entree), and hazelnut ice cream cake (dessert).  The salad was surprisingly fresh and clean tasting with its citrus tasting, so if you're trying to be healthy, go for this over  the salmon tartare which isn't that memorable.

Instead what I received was inconsistent, slow, and obnoxious service.To start the tables are far too crowded together. You cannot get by without bumping into another family. My table was the worst as there was a horrible draft that when I mentioned it to a waiter he said that he would check on it but never returned to ask if our situation was improved. Even though at this point I had to put on my coat, something which the GM noticed but instead of trying to attend to the paying customers he kept making side comments about me and my family to his back waiters. The lobster was tough, and chewy. Not something expecting of a small piece of poached salmon. The steak and green beans was BARE. There was nothing else on the plate, not visually pleasing.My turkey was a huge slab, of white meat (on a white plate) lumped ontop of a handful of bland vegetables.One of my companions felt a little under the weather and asked if she could have her dessert to go. The same waiter who she told this too arrives 10 minutes later to set her dessert cutlery infront of her. So again she reminds him that she will not be having dessert at the table. 7 minutes later and her dessert is placed infront of her. She has to tell the waitress that this should've never come to the table cause she asked for it to go. She also asked if they could leave out the ice cream because it would melt and make everything else soggy. After she returned with my to-go bag we do not realize until after we left the restaurant that she included the ice cream.Thanks for not listening to your guests, Aureole.

5.0,11/22/2015,"Had the 5 course tasting menu with wine pairings. A fabulous meal!Nicely appointed dining room, very attentive (without being annoying)service. Started out with a peekytoe crab amuse bouche which was a harbinger of things to come. Oh, and the bread choices are delicious.I always pay attention to bread- crappy bread usually means the rest ofthe meal will disappoint. Tuna tartare- best tuna dish I've ever eaten, freshas could be, and the rose a perfect pairing. Foie gras with spiced waffle and acognac based vintage, superb. Then, a perfectly cooked slab of cod with another well matched rose. Finally, steak and a robust red. Only miss- the steak, while perfectly cooked, didn't have that really aged, funky depth of flavor associated with the great steakhouses, but a minor blip. To finish, some Madeira with a hazelnut ice cream concoction which was so pretty on the plate we didn't want to mess it up by eating it.

5.0,11/21/2015,"An incredibly memorable and exquisite dining experience. The Chef's 5 course tasting is basically the highlight reel of their menu and it does not disappoint. The chef graciously subbed out the foie gras for anything else on the menu because my companion and I are not foie gras fans, which we very much appreciated! Don't be afraid to ask for accommodations for dietary restrictions, the staff is more than happy to modify the menu for you.Everything else on the tasting menu is straight fire.

2.0,10/25/2015,"Having been to several Michelin starred restaurants in France and Monaco, I was excited when I realized this place had a star, had not realized when I booked.  But it did not live up to the hype if there ever was any.  The dining room in the back is stale and the door is right next to the service area so you can hear the clanking of dishes and cutlery from your table.  The room itself is uninspiring - a hotel ballroom feel to it as my wife commented.The service meant well and was very aggressive but it was simply not polished and was very hesitant at times, not well coordinated.  The Maitre D did a good job of owning the table, or perhaps he was the Table Captain, I don't know but it felt all over the place.The tuna tartare was good but not at all impressive, have had better ones elsewhere, no creativity in this one.  The seared foie gras was good also, but as the French will say it was ""écœurant"" in that it was just a massive slab, not the highest quality and just a LOT of liver with not much else going on.  The black cod was very good, the NY Strip quite disappointing with tendons.  This was maybe worth $200 pre-tip but certainly not the $300 we ultimately paid and I have absolutely no problem spending money on good food.  The prices above assume a decent wine bottle ($75).  We had capuccinos that came out well after the desserts and were burning hot, we ultimately did not drink them as a result.",0,0,0,Manny S.,"Newton Centre, MA",24,212,13

2.0,8/13/2015,"This review is based on my recent Restaurant Week experience, in the Liberty Room:For a one-Michelin-starred restaurant, this place was an overall disappointment. From the outside the restaurant looks great, with the glass wine mezzanine floating over the dining area. Once I stepped inside though, I noticed how noisy it was. Noisier than 42nd Street just outside. I order at the bar while I wait for my party, and the bartender inelegantly splashes a bit of wine into the glass and thumps the bottle down on the bar for me to look at, not bothering to turn the label fully or even watch what she's doing, because she's too busy chatting with the busboy. I would expect that at a Michelin-starred place, one would hold or at least gently place the bottle with care in front of the taster. She did the same with my two friends who later arrived. The rest of the meal at the table was not much better. The food was ok but either taste or presentation was slightly off in each dish. The gazpacho was flat. Sitting down, we notice how dirty the bottom of that glass wine mezzanine (the one that initially drew me to the restaurant) was. Then we notice the laminate of the table was peeling. At the end they forgot to transfer the bar tab to our table and had to correct the check. In summary, I don't think this place should have any Michelin stars.",4,2,0,August L.,"Manhattan, NY",26,27,5

1.0,8/6/2015,"This review is for the Patio Bar ONLY.  I've had dinner in the dining room before and it's been great.  Today, I met a friend here for drinks before attending a play.  We got seated out on the Patio about 5:40PM and thought we'd have time for a drink & a nibble.  The waitress asked if we were going to a play & I told her that we had a 7PM curtain and we'd have to leave about 6:30-6:40PM.  We ordered drinks, an Apple Martini & Vodka Tonic and told her we wanted to have a quick bite. She said she'd bring us a Bites menu.  10 mins later, she came back with the menu & said they don't have any apple juice for the martini???  I told her there an Apple Martini doesn't need real apple juice ... anyway, my friend changed her order to a Chocolate Martini instead.  Another 10 mins. later, the waitress brings my Vodka Tonic, but no martini.  Another 10 mins, I'm half finished with my drink and the Chocolate Martini arrives.  The waitress asks if we want to order some food and I told her it's 6:22PM and we no longer have time.I was totally shocked and dumbfounded at this visit.  The Patio was practically empty with only 2 other couples and the inside bar was not packed like other places are around that area.  I just don't understand the exceptionally slow and inattentive service at such a prominent establishment.  I wish I could comment on the lite bites (that sounded very nice on the menu), but we never had a chance to even order anything.If you are looking for a pre-theater place to go for a drink and snacks, I'm sorry to say, I wouldn't recommend the Patio Bar at Aureole.",1,0,0,Norm C.,"East Elmhurst, NY",0,34,34

4.0,7/31/2015,"Right now, I'm going through a phase where I'm a sucker for the Michelin stars, which is what drew me to this place. That and a convenient walking distance from my office. I took myself to lunch here the other day and I really enjoyed it. The service was a little slow, but not in an annoying way, but more so in a way that forces you really enjoy your meal and the whole experience instead of rushing through your meal like it's a boring take out chopped salad. In a way that makes you lean back and say, ""This is nice."" The space is beautiful, with a high ceiling and windows to match and a modern wine cellar seemingly floating above the dining room. It gets pretty noisy in the ""liberty room"". It's picturesque, but at the peak of lunch, it's difficult or close to impossible to hear anyone a foot away from you. I didn't check out the inner room, but if you can get in there instead, I'd recommend that since the space is a little smaller. My server was a delight and didn't treat me any differently since I was alone. Everything seemed to be running efficiently with no real hiccups. There was a decent space between courses which only made me a little antsy since I had to get back to work, but it was a welcome break from the fluorescent lights of my office. The food was great. I had the gazpacho, the trout and then the panna cotta. Docked a star because as the soup was brought to me, right before the server poured in the soup, I noticed there was a short hair on the plate that I nabbed right before the liquid drowned it. I did it right in front of the guy and he didn't even seem to notice. Everything was absolutely delicious though. The trout was amazing. Tender, flaky with a perfectly seared, crispy skin, atop of a bed of perfectly cooked edamame that wasn't too tough and hard but wasn't mush either along with peppery greens for a little bit of a bite. The silky panna cotta with tart berries with refreshing and the perfect finish. So besides the stray hair and the noise level, everything was splendid.",1,1,1,Jen C.,"New York, NY",162,193,165

Why weren't we EVER accorded that same respect? -- We were even dressed more nicely than they were so that's not the reason!!!  He ignored my Japanese friend  when she was trying to ask for a pen, (to write down on the check her complaint) -- but even then, when he gave her a pen, HE DIDN'T SAY ONE WORD!!!  Absolutely BIZARRE behavior!!!  You're better off going to Jean Georges Nougatine for about the same price -- the food is great and your waiter will treat you MUCH better.",2,0,0,Alex C.,"New York, NY",0,5,0

Excellent plating, great quality of food and great service. However, I am reserving one star because it just wasn't anything that blew me away. Perhaps I'm too spoiled by the NYC food scene (so much good food), but I really thought my meal was just above average.My friends and I came here for their restaurant week dinner menu, which consisted of an appetizer, a main course and dessert for $38. I got a salad to start, trout as my main course and finished with a panna cotta for dessert. For me, the highlight of my meal was the panna cotta - creamy yet silky texture and just the right amount of sweetness which was balanced out by the tartness and sourness of fruit.

3.0,7/21/2015,"I came here for restaurant week with a few friends. I actually thought it was just a special room for restaurant week-ers but soon realized it was actually a different section with a different menu. It also seems like the food on the restaurant week menu isn't even in their normal menu for the Liberty Room, which to me, is a bit strange. What I ate:- Gazpacho: This actually tasted really good. The octopus tasted great with the soup they poured on top, and it wasn't too sour. - Trout: This was the part I didn't like about the meal. Maybe I just don't like trout (I normally don't have it much), but it didn't taste very good. There wasn't much flavor, but maybe adding salt would have helped. The portion was rather large though. - Panna Cotta: This was delicious. I'm not the biggest fan of the dessert, but I could see myself eating this everyday. It wasn't too heavy or sweet and had plenty of fruit on top. Giving this place 3 stars because while I enjoyed 2 of the courses, I feel that the main entree is the most important, which I didn't enjoy.

The presentation of the kielbasa on a bed of potatoes with green pea sprouts was funny... hehehe! The kielbasa was salty, the mashed potato was pretty good and underneath it all was a light layer of some sauce.The panna cotta was excellent, it really redeemed the entrée. I don't usually like panna cotta, but this one was light, smooth, creamy, and not too dense. It was really good on top of a light, sweet bed of raspberry sauce!

4.0,7/9/2015,"Impressive. I will start by saying that typically, when visiting ""nice"" restaurants in the Times Square/Bryant Park areas, you have to compromise. That is, these establishments will jack up the price by 1 dollar sign just because of the location/proximity to tourists, but you'll actually be receiving an inferior dining experience (aka, if you're going to a $$$ restaurant here, you can actually expect a $$ food quality, service, etc). Aureole is an exception. I felt like I was in a true $$$ establishment. They do have 1 Michelin star, which is indicative of the attention to detail you hope for. AMBIENCE - it is quiet. Amazing when it's literally less than two blocks away from Madam Tussaud's lol, but true! Formality-wise, at lunch, there are a good mix of patrons who are wearing jackets and patrons who are not. Skewed heavy towards business diners.  Dim but warm lighting, wine collection encased upstairs and visible from the dining areas. SERVICE - attentive, polite, but nothing crazy. One thing that I always notice is when the servers coordinate to set down everyone's plates at the same time. I usually take that as a signal that they go the extra mile. Aureole did this as best they could (they did not have a 1:1 ratio of servers to guests at the table, so there was a bit of a delay for a few people). It wasn't with the precision of Jean-Georges, but I get the point and appreciated it. FOOD - pretty good. I will say that it did not blow me away, but it did leave me pretty happy. There is a lunch pre fixe option (2 courses $38, 3 courses $43) that I opted for. I got the yellowtail hamachi crudo and the andouille sausage. Both were pretty good. The crudo was thickly cut and garnished with among other things, mini potato chips! It kind of worked, looked super pretty, and I enjoyed it. I will say that the crudo had a bit more of that fishy taste than I usually like in hamachi. The sausage also nice - it came with some spicy shrimp and sweet creamed corn. The sausage itself was slightly spicy and NOT overly salty. The shrimp was a bit dry, but the corn was awesome!! OVERALL - So, I would say that if you're thinking of a place to go for a business lunch in the area, this is one of your best bets. It's a peaceful respite, good service, decent food. If, however, you can travel even ten blocks up or down, and you're looking for a special place to spend your own money, I might still think twice and go to one of the other amazing, price-comparative, restaurants that the city has to offer!",3,0,1,Viv M.,"New York, NY",195,105,17

1.0,5/29/2015,No detail to large or small to fail at. The dining room is loud due to it being connected to a lively bar. The service staff hasn't figured out how to smoothly serve a meal nor do they take hints when a service fail has been indicated but instead attempt to justify their choice. I had the Rabbit pasta as a first course and I found it to be a mushy mess of goo. I was able to find the pasta in the goo as well as some rabbit. A theme which continued through the remainder of dishes was that the ingredients do not add up to a cohesive flavor. The chef subscribes to the just keep adding ingredients school. Even dessert was a mess. I thought I was getting chocolate cake. What I received was a round ball of two ice cream flavors with a caramel center which was circled by the tiniest ring of cake. By tiny I mean about two teaspoons flat. The ball of ice cream was covered with meringue drops. The textures and the flavors of the dishes were a mess.

My colleagues who were dining with me ordered the rabbit pasta and foei gras, which were very good. Service was slow and somewhat unresponsive.

2.0,5/2/2015,"I wavered when making this reservation ... never heard any fellow New Yorkers talking about it ... but we were looking for a new Theater District place to try before a show and the Yelp reviews were pretty good on Aureole, so I thought, ""why not?"" Wish I had stuck with my gut. While the restaurant personnel were very nice and the food was decent, there were a few issues that made us not want to return. First, there was an inexcusable lull between our first and second courses, making us nearly late for our show (and forget about dessert). As for the food ... My husband had the artichoke soup, which he said was good (although one note too many with the shrimp included). I had crudo, which was fine but sliced too thickly, and there was way too much of it, overwhelming the pineapple-kiwi accompaniments on the plate. We both had the lamb entree, which was tasty overall but the meat was a bit on the tough side and had a somewhat gamey flavor.So, to the bill: for one G&T, one martini, a mid-range bottle of Chateauneuf, two apps and two entrees ... total bill, with tip, $580. I don't mind spending a lot on a meal if the value is there, but you don't want to pay that much for ""meh."" One star deducted for the price.Next time we're going to Broadway, it's back to Lamb's Club! (We've been many times and it's always good.) Or I hear The Marshall is worth a try.

4.0,4/27/2015,"When I saw Aureole on the list for the latest NYC Restaurant Week, I knew I had to go! It is absolutely a steal and a great way to try the cuisine for the first time. - Great bread basket and they seemed to have no problems with refilling it.- The fois gras was wonderful: rich, decadent and huge. One person did not need to eat all of it..buuut...I had to. The touch of acidity was much needed and really brought this dish together. The fois gras reminded me of the best fois gras I'd ever had in Paris.- The salmon was simple yet funky with a nice pop of saltiness coming from the roe.- The carrot cake was my favorite. The cake was moist and the frosting was just sweet enough.- The chocolate dessert was interesting and decadent but the ganache was a bit odd. I can't believe I'm saying that as a chocolate lover, but whatevs.Service was great, as was to be expected. The location - in such close proximity to Times Square - makes me weep a little inside and I really didn't love the LED billboards shining into the bar/casual area (which is where the RW tables are).

Main course was beef, beef so tender one didn't need teeth, so tender it melted in your mouth, so tender it was probably full of fat, so tender one may consider selling a soul for another bite. Delicious, best piece of meat I've had in a while. Given the amazingness of the place, you would except desserts to be strong. Desserts were quite lame. Pretty presentation but not very good at all. We had the carrot cake, it was stale, the frosting was great. We also had the chocolate ganache something, it tasted off. Bread basket galore.

1.0,4/25/2015,"The four of us came for a 10:30pm reservation for a birthday. The restaurant was pretty empty. The minute we were seated we received terrible service from our waiter Corey. He is a tall, bald Caucasian man. He was incredibly rude the whole time. He gave us dirty looks. When I told him it was my sister's birthday he said ""Yeah ok and?"" Most of what we wanted to order were not available because they ran out of it by then. After we were done with our entrees, he didn't offer us dessert menus. He kept smirking every time he would pass our table without ever asking how we were doing. Our last straw was when my cousin asked him to take away her dirty napkin. He looked at her with disgust, left to get another napkin. Put that napkin on the table and asked her to put her napkin on top. He then threw the napkins into the trash and shook his hands off with disgust right in front of us. I have never been treated so vulgar dining at what is supposed to be a fine dining experience. At this point we asked for a different server and to speak to the manager. The manager refused to come to our table and instead sent the ""captain"" of servers. We told him we were not pleased at all with the service and asked to speak to the manager. He finally came to our table 10 minutes later and DEFENDED his server. At that point we were so upset, we asked to cancel our dessert for the birthday girl and asked for the check. I will NEVER return to this restaurant nor will I ever recommend this place to anyone.

4.0,4/5/2015,"As part of NY restaurant week and my very late birthday dinner, we went to Aureole in Times Square to celebrate. The interior was exquisite with a huge light fixture that kept me intrigued. It wasn't fancy, but it was out of the ordinary. The other draw that people may like is that it is right in Time Squares, but I am not a big fan of that location. The light from the signs kept leaking into the restaurant. I believe they may have dimmed the blinds later though.We had a reservation and were sat promptly, and the hostess asked if we needed our coats checked. We politely declined and were walked to our table. It was around 5:30 I believe and the restaurant had some patrons inside already. The table set up was a bit cramped as we were no more than Five inches away from the table to our left and right. You can actually see it in the picture belowWe started off with drinks from the menu, and I got a sour cocktail. I think it might have been their Aureole special? I forgot as they don't have their drink menus on their website. Oh well, it was good nonetheless. We made our three choices for the tasting menu and shortly after we placed our order, a wooden basket of varies breads came for us. I must say that the wooden basket was a nice touch, and so was the variety of breads. I think my favorite one was the thickest one to the right of the photo because I recall it had an olive oil taste to it.The first course was the Foie Gras Torchon, which is toasted brioche, foie gras, and grapefruit marmalade. This dish was on point until you eat too much of it. The foie gras was good intially in conjunction with the toasted bread and marmalade, but after a certain point the foie gras was very overwhelming. I ended up having to spread it on the other breads to neutralize the taste. Brioche was nice and crispy and the marmalade was something I would buy home to put on the rest of my toasts forever.The second course I selected was the Olive Oil Poached Scottish Salmon with Watercress Veloute and Yukon Potato. Hmm... I am a bit split about my opinion about this dish. On one hand, the salmon was solid, but I expected something more special. The fish alone tasted a bit flavorless, but the green sauce, which I believe is Watercress Veloute, gave it some flavor but not enough. I think the dish could have used a bit more salt in it, as the potato with the fish made this dish taste very basic. That is just my two amateur cents however.To finish off, we both got the Warm Chocolate Ganache with Oreo Cookie, Caramel, and Espresso Ice Cream for dessert. I liked the way ganache is pronounced so that's why I selected it as my last course. Presentation was awesome, but the taste leaves something to be desired. The ice cream was very generic, and we all know what oreos taste like. The little chocolate thing (I think it's chocolate) was not my cup of tea. It had a bit of a chewy waxy texture to it, something I'm not fond of. I hate licorice by the way.Service was pretty standard. Our needs were met but nothing memorable. As with many fancier dining places, I am usually disappointed with the taste quality of food they give. Presentation and decoration is usually on point, but service and taste is usually not elite tier. As this is a Charlie Palmer restaurant, maybe the NYC restaurant week tasting menu isn't up to par with their standard, but the tasting menu is what allows someone to judge a restaurant. Cool place if you want to go on a little more fancy date and you're in Time Square, but I'm not sure if I would trek all the way to eat here again.Thank you for reading!For more check befreelifestyle.com",0,0,0,Koty W.,"Newark, NJ",142,68,114
4.0,3/31/2015,"The 2 of us came on a Sunday night for a 6:30pm reservation. We were seated right away at a lovely corner booth in the back room where the prix fixe people were sitting. However, this booth was right next to the register where all the servers hung out so it was a little annoying in the sense that we never felt truly ""alone"". But I digress, the service was absolutely amazing. I would give the service a 5/5 and the food a 4/5 (for the price). We went for the 3 course meal for $96 each. I started with the ""halo 75"" cocktail which was prosecco and gin, with sage and lemon ($14). A refreshing drink to start the meal. Before the meal we each got an amuse bouche of lobster in an egg shell that had some caviar, egg and butter which was delightful. For the first course, my hubby got the braised rabbit with celery pesto, olives and garganelli pasta. I got the petite salad greens with aged gouda, candied almonds, pluot, and hearts of palm. Both were tasty and plentiful. 2nd course was the ribeye with brussels sprouts and mashed potato and I got the steamed sea bass with red pepper piperade, saffron eggplant purée in a clam and mussel vinaigrette. Both were good. Not blow your mind good but enjoyable. Dessert was a lovely selection of sorbets and ice creams. Yum! 6 kinds. We also got a milk chocolate flourless cake with passion fruit sorbet. Both were delicious. Total bill with tax and tip was $264. A pricey meal but not surprising given that this is a Michelin star restaurant.

3.0,3/25/2015,"I was really torn between 3 and 4 stars. I think Aureole is probably a solid 3.5 stars in my books - but alas, Yelp doesn't allow for that. First, the good. The food was good. My Foie Gras Torchon was divine and my Olive Oil Poached Scottish Salmon with Watercress Veloute and Yukon Potato Mash was also very good. I loved the mixture of mash and salmon together in each bite! The pretty much unlimited bread basket didn't hurt either - the bread was pretty good. I also had the Aureole cocktail, which I really enjoyed. It's sort of like passionfruit bubble tea without the boba and spiked with alcohol! Now, the bad. Our waiter had asked us when we sat down, if we had a show to get to. We told him no. Basically, this meant we wouldn't be in a rush. But they fed us as if we were in a rush. We barely had any time in between courses to digest a little bit. Less than 5 minutes after they cleared our appetizer dishes, our entrees showed up. And then our desserts came almost the moment our entree dishes were cleared. I know we eat fast normally, but this was just too much. We had finished dinner in under an hour - we felt so rushed! And then our waiter dropped off our check before we even asked for it. I really, really hate that. It's a pet peeve of mine. And then, to top it off, we literally saw our waiter twice - when we ordered and then when he dropped off the check. Each time our plates were taken, it was a new person. Each time a new dish came, it was a different person. It just felt so inconsistent because each time a server approached our table, it was someone different. I'd return to Aureole if I'm in the area, but I wouldn't make any special trips to eat here. The food was good but I'm still a little offended by the service. I know it was Restaurant Week, but still. I don't think I've been rushed like this before at any other RW restaurant - not even during busy lunches.",2,0,2,Michelle T.,"New York, NY",367,1165,1125

2.0,3/14/2015,"We had the $96 prix fixe menu before attending a show and I must say the overall experience was uneven and disappointing.Food: The food was ok. We had the tuna, foie gras terrine, wagyu and Alaskan cod. Everything was decent but nothing to write home about.Service: This is where the night really started to fall apart. I had three specific complaints.1. They were sort of confused: Throughout the night, they continually brought us each other's food. Every dish was given to the wrong person. Not a big deal but just sort of weird for a nice place not to have worked it out after making the mistake once.2. They were inconsistent: we sat fairly close to another table and watched all meal as the waiter would put it down and explain what the dish was, you know, as they would normally do in swanky joints like this. This never happened for us. They would set down the plate (at the wrong place) and then scurry away. 3. They were unresponsive: We had a rocky table and asked for someone to just come and wedge something under a leg. 15 minutes later, nothing had happened and they actually brought out and amuse bouche, cleared that and brought out the appetizers to serve on the rocky table. I had to ask for it again for someone to come fix it.They also left us stewing for another 15 minutes after they cleared away our main courses before we had to ask to be shown the dessert menu. (Desserts are part of the prix fixe so its pretty clear we are going to have some.) Worst of all, is that when I provided this feedback to a manager, he nodded politely and said he would check with a server... And that was it. I have no idea what the outcome of his inquiry is. He was standing by the door as we left and he said thank you but acted as if nothing had happened. He never followed up with us and I figured I'd just let it slide. I have a show to get to anyway.Taken individually, none of these points are a big deal. Sure someone forgot about our rocky table and messed up the seating layout, that could happen to anyone.

4.0,3/8/2015,"My best friend and I came here on the last night of restaurant week. We had reservations at 9:45 PM and arrived right on the dot. The manager greeted us when we came in and told us our table should be ready in 5 minutes. He recommended we grab a drink at their bar and we were happy to. The bartender was quite busy and didn't take our drink order for about 10 minutes. It was okay because we were still deciding on the drink menu and he had informed us politely that he would be right back to take our order. I had the Aureole (Vodka/Midori/Creme de Cassis/Passion Fruit Puree/ Lime Juice) and my friend had an Above the Law (Tequila/Grenadine/ Maraschino Liquor/Lime Juice). Both were SO DELICIOUS. And pretty. We chatted and sipped our drinks for the next 20 minutes wondering when our table would be ready. Restaurant week was only available in their more casual Liberty Room and we kept peeking and noticed it was quite busy. Finally we saw an open table for two, but no one came to tell us our table was ready. So after a total of 30 minutes at the bar, we finally spoke up and asked the hostess about our table. She said it was ready. She gave us a confusing explanation about seating another larger group and not sure how the final seating would be, I'm not sure how that applied to our table,  it didn't make a lot of sense. But we were seated finally. Someone brought our drinks from the bar to our table and two people came right away, back to back asking us what kind of water we wanted. The manager did not come to our table. I had expected him to, to perhaps apologize for whatever happened. But he didn't, instead another waiter came to our table and poured both of us flutes of champagne, on the house for the wait. That was nice. We weren't too upset about the whole thing since we had good drinks and good company. I don't need to elaborate too much about their restaurant week menu, it was simply amazing. The portions were HUGE. You get a lot for your $50. We had the foie gras and bucatini appetizers, braised short ribs, and both the carrot cake and chocolate dessert. AMAZING.

4.0,3/6/2015,"Aureole was my first michelin one-star restaurant.  I was super excited to try it out for Restaurant Week.  For the appetizer, we ordered the Foie Gras Torchon.  It was served with grapefruit marmalade and toast.  The Foie Gras was rich and buttery in texture.  The combination of the foie gras with the grapefruit marmalade was a little bitter to taste for my preference, even though the marmalade was ever so slightly sweet.  The two mini slices of toast definitely wasn't enough to gulf down that entire slice of foie gras.  For the entree, I ordered the olive oil poached salmon.  I had watched a kid on master chef Junior make a dish similar to this, so I was really compelled to try it out.  I loved the combination of the dish--the protein, the mashed potato, the watercress puree, and the roe. The watercress puree was delicious.  The mashed potatoes and the roe helped were flavorful too.  However, the salmon was rather overcooked, dry, and didn't have much flavor.  I also tried a bite of my friend's Winter Risotto.  It definitely wasn't your typical Risotto.  They used barley to replicate the rice, and there was no seafood in it.  The spice and flavor rendered was excellent.  However, the barley was rather tough and the risotto was not nearly as creamy as a regular risotto.  Aureole gets credit for being inventive though.Dessert was carrot cake with cream cheese mousse and creme anglaise.  The texture of the cake was rather stiff or harder than your regular carrot cake.  However, I thought the dessert was the highlight of my meal.  The cream cheese mousse was light and airy, with just a hint of cream cheese.  The cake was a little sweet but it was balanced with a pinch of saltiness all throughout the plate, which really gave it a nice touch and good end to our meal.  Service was great throughout our meal.  Our cups were refilled and different waiters kept on asking us if everything was okay.  What threw me off was that our food was brought to us super speedily (like bam, bam, bam).  Right after we were done with our dessert, we were given the check and the waiter hovered over us as we were paying it.  While I do appreciate very attentive and speedy service, that was a little too fast and not what I expect from upscale dining.  My friend suggested that the reason for the fast service was because they worry that we had a Broadway show to attend afterwards.  However, I had already told them that we weren't rushing for a show, so I don't know if that's a legitimate reason or not.  I'll leave that up to you.",1,0,0,Nathaniel L.,"Flushing, Queens, NY",74,80,178

I would certainly return to see what this place is like on a "" normal night"". That said, I really did enjoy my overall experience, yet was somewhat underwhelmed with some specifics on the menu.Our service was great! From the hostesses to our waiter, everyone was warm yet had a formal gracefulness that fit the setting. As for the setting, we dined in the Liberty Room ( the more casual dining side) and it was gorgeous! I really loved the oversized modern light fixture and the glass encased wine cellar mezzanine above the dining area. It felt super modern and elegant. Onto the food... I actually was quite happy with the bread basket at the start. It was divine. We both ordered the bucatini pasta with shrimp for our appetizer. We both agreed the pasta was tasty and well made, but the shrimp was surprisingly underwhelming, tasting more like warmed up pre-cooked fare.  We then also both had the braised short ribs for our mains. It was a beautifully plated dish, the flavors were ok, not bad at all but certainly nothing I'm going to be jonsing for in the future. For dessert my date had the carrot cake and I enjoyed the warm chocolate ganache. The espresso ice cream with Oreo crumbles was delicious! It may have been the highlight for me. In addition to the food I was super happy with my wine selection, an Argentinean malbec that I had to get the name of since I plan to buy it for home.Overall will I return to Aureole? Yes.

If I really didn't care for a wine, she happily brought something else. My ONLY complaint is that I felt the quality of the wines poured was not in line with the food. If I'm going to pop for the luxury-experience meal, I would expect the pairings to live up to the food. Several of the wines I knew I could get at any Manhattan liquor store, and they are not expensive. I would expect to see more small-producer treasures, etc. If I had it to do over, I would forgo the pairings, and just get one or two good bottles.

The service was also pretty slow so we were close to starving by the time we got our food. Despite all this, the food was plated beautifully and tasted amazing (not sure how much of this was influenced by the fact that we were hungry). In general, I like the atmosphere here (classy but not stuffy) and the location is easy to find/convenient, but Restaurant Week just makes this place a little too hectic/slow.

4.0,2/22/2015,"Me and my friends went here for the 2015 Winter Restaurant Week Dinner. It was great! We were generally satisfied consider how much we paid for. Also we had one vegeterian member and they accomodate the restaurant week menu for him which was quite nice I think.1. We sat right next to the main door so it was quite busy and noisy, but the interior was great especially I really liked to see the wine reservior upstairs.2. For the appetizer, I had a foie gras torchon. It does not have any particular sauce on it so I was a bit worried if it still has that smell of raw liver, but thanks god it was delicious. It was very soft and tasty, and I was quite surprised that they did not charge extra fee for this one. Bcz I saw other restaurants charging additional fee for foie gras even on the restaurant week menu. But some of my friends who had the pasta did not like it because they said it was overcooked.3. For the Entree, I had a rib and it was amazing. Probably 3 out of 4 stars of my rating are coming fron this one. The rib was tendor but moist inside, and the side this(I guess beet) was a very perfect combination with the meat. I didn't like the small potatoes and broccolli puree was not my style but my friend liked that so I would say it just depends on personal preferences. My friends who had the salmon and risotto also liked their dishes.4. I had a carrot cake and there was also chocolate option and I tried it. Carrot cake was good, nutty I would say. The chocolate brownie was probably too sweet and chewy but the espresso ice cream was good and kind of compensate the sweetness of others I think.Nice place to visit for a restaurant week meal!",0,0,0,Seoeun L.,"New York, NY",24,67,148
4.0,2/22/2015,"the food was delicious. the foie gras was some of the best i've ever had, including the foie gras in Paris.  it came with a orange marmalade that was sweet instead of tangy, the way i like. the entree was this huge braised  short rib that was probably the most tender piece of beef i've ever had in my life. it was delicious and fell apart with just a fork and butter knife. i could see why it got such good ratings. definitely no hint of touristy Times Square at all. The portion was gigantic....almost the size of Cheesecake factory entrees. I ate half of it and was stuffed. it was all presented so prettily too. dessert was also impressive. it was a carrot cake that tasted so delicious i thought, ""what do they put in there!"" i was stuffed but i still ate half the thing. the frosting was light and not sweet and neither was the cake, but it was delicious. i would definitely go back and taste the rest of the menu. the whole restaurant is lit up with a beautiful golden glow that relaxes you, and the service is excellent.",0,1,0,rebecca h.,"Harrison, NJ",86,3,0
4.0,2/21/2015,"Let me start off by saying we went for restaurant week. We had reservations but had to wait a little bit for our table. However the hostess was sweet and kept apologizing as it was extremely packed - more than we anticipated. Once we were sat, it was in a uncomfortable table so my boyfriend asked if we could be moved - at first they said they couldn't accommodate us but would try... within 10 mins we were moved to a more intimate cozy table. It was very sweet and considerate of them to do so. It was louder then we would have liked it to be but eventually as patrons left it quieted down. So its not really a romantic setting more of a group or just dining to dine out dinner. We had the most wonderful waiter, Damien. If I ever opened a restaurant I would want all my waiters to be like Damien. He let us sample the wine so that we were choosing blindly, he was attentive but not overbearing. He was funny and kind and just make the night much more pleasurable. The course were satisfying. The foie gras terrine was delicious! I highly recommend it the contrast of flavors were wonderful. The braised short rib was to die for! The meat was the star and none of the other flavors including the meat was arrogant. It was well balanced. I wouldn't recommend the oreo chocolate dessert unless you want to overdose on chocolate - just way too much. But the carrot cake was refreshing and light. Overall great evening.

This review only applies to our restaurant week experience and not their regular or prix fixe menu. My party of 4 was seated at the table nearest to the door. As it was 10 degrees outside, every time someone would open the door, our table was hit with a gust of freezing cold air. It took over 10 minutes for my table to be greeted by a waiter who took our drinks and orders together since so much time had passed since we were seated. While the appetizers arrived after a reasonable amount of time, we waited what seemed like forever for our entrees to arrive. At no point did our waiter check in on us throughout the entirety of the meal. While the food was solid, it did not justify the freezing cold dinner, over 2 hour dining experience, and being ignored by the waiter. Putrid is the only word that comes to mind after my Aureole experience. Even for $38 the price was not worth it.",2,0,0,Mike L.,"Manhattan, NY",0,7,1
4.0,2/20/2015,"I enjoyed myself here! We dined at the Liberty Room for Restaurant Week.Honestly was not blown away by the food, but the ambiance and great service more than made up for the price tag! We came during the Restaurant Week special, which offers a 3 course meal for $38. Since I came with a table of 5, we tried every combination available. Here's what I got:1) Appetizer - Foie Gras. I highly recommend this, probably the best appetizer on the menu. I got a fairly large portion of heavenly foie gras with two pieces of perfectly toasted bread on the side. If you find yourself short on bread, you could always spread the remaining foie gras on the bread from the wonderful complementary bread basket (which by the way, they happily refill promptly whenever you are done).2) Main Course - Braised Short Ribs. This was pretty good! As other reviewers mentioned, this is very lean, with little fat. It's always difficult to cook such lean meat, and I thought it was slightly dry. Would've liked if it was served with some sort of wine reduction sauce. My sister got the salmon dish, which I thought was executed much better.3) Dessert - Chocolate Ganache. Really disappointed with this. The icecream they paired the ganache with was delicious but the actual ganache had an odd gelatin flavor that I did not enjoy.Overall, the food was good but I did not leave super impressed. However, I feel pretty confident that this place is one of the best you can go to for Restaurant Week.

Both were good, but the tenderness and flavor of the salmon really stood out. The short rib was a bit lean for my taste.

For the entree, I always go for one of the seafood entrees: Seared Yellow Fin Tuna Niçoise Salad, Scottish Salmon, or Skate Wing. All solid options. None of them are mindblowing, but the flavoring and presentation are always right on the money. My favorite dish at Aureole is easily the Tasting Of Sorbets And Ice Creams for dessert.

I was surprised that someone would choose a place in Times Square for a nice dinner but realized it kind of made sense...this place, while nice, seems to cater to a business crowd (which made sense as the group I was with came into town for a conference being held at the Marriott). Food was super pricey and the portions were very small.  The food was good, not spectacular and definitely not representative of the prices. I tried the Wagyu Beef because I've heard how fancy and delicious it is supposed to be (and truth be told, I wasn't paying for the dinner so I went with something I'd not usually order). I was not impressed. It was good, as were the potatoes, but nothing fancy. Honestly, the gravy it was in made it just taste like a roast beef dish. The brussel sprouts were exceptionally bitter. The desserts were by far the show stopper...each one was like a piece of art and all were delicious. Service here, from the hostess to the bartender to the servers was tremendous.If you are looking for a place for an expensive business dinner near Times Square, this is your place.

5.0,1/12/2015,"This is my first review on yelp. My wife and I spent a wonderful dining experience here for our fifth anniversary and I was so impressed that I wanted to write a review here.- Ambience: we were seated in the inner dining area, separated from bar and outer dining area, which was pretty loud and crowded on the Friday evening during happy hour. But the inner dining area was a completely different atmosphere, quiet and romantic, sufficient space for each table so you don't feel too close to your neighboring diners, and perfect for a date.- Service: we were served in a very courteous and professional manner. We were not sure if we wanted the regular tasting menu or chef's tasting menu, because you don't see what dishes are going to be served in the chef's tasting menu. But we wanted to try venison or lobster. So I told our waiter and he said he'd see if there was anything he could do. So we ordered the chef's tasting menu.- Food: what surprised us is that we got both lobster and venison in our epic 7 course chef's tasting menu! We started with an amuse bouche of a single oyster. My wife doesn't even like raw oyster and never had it before. But she finished it with a big smile on her face. Our actual courses included a hamachi crudo, lobster salad, Alaskan black cod, foie gras, venison, and wagyu beef cheek. The delicious chocolate cremeux as dessert arrived on a plate with a candle and ""Happy Anniversary"" in chocolate).  Every single dish was superb and every ingredient was cooked to perfection. The cod and venison practically melted in our mouth and the beef cheek was so tender, juicy and flavorful.  The sauces, vegetables and presentation of every dish was fantastic.Overall this was one of our best dining experiences in 5 years of living in NYC (including a number of other Michelin starred restaurants).

This is probably one of the best restaurants i've ever been to.  Everything from the service to the food was top notch. i opted for the 5 course dinner tasting for $125.    We also got a complimentary raw oyster to start our meal that was excellent.  Literally every single course was a home run.  I'll say that the Pan Seared Hudson Valley Foie Gras, the Alaskan Black Cod, and the Chocolate Cremeaux were my favorite items.  A couple specifics from my meal:1.  The Roasted Wagyu Beef course came with this small cubed crispy potato.  It tasted like a Tator Tot but it was so freaking awesome!  It's just one small bite of food that accompanied the meal but it was one of the best bites of the night!2.  The Chocolate Cremeaux was probably the best dessert that I've ever had.  This dish sang ""cookies n cream"" to me in terms of flavors and I'm a huge cookies n cream fan when it comes to ice scream, smoothies, macroons, and desserts in general.I will def like to come back in the future to experience another awesome meal and hopefully try some other fantastic dishes from Aureole!",0,0,0,Noble K.,"Sugar Land, TX",279,142,130

4.0,9/7/2014,"I came here last week for a private dinner so i will begin by saying that the review may be skewed since the service was exceptional(Private dinner that was over staffed so my wine glass was always full) and I can't comment on the price because some of the items we ate were not on their regular menu. To start we had tuna tartare and a lobster appetizer (did not see this on their menu online) - both exceptional. Then came the brown butter and sage ricotta ravioli - amazing but heavy. Cod and beef (both on the regular menu) also very very good. Dessert was average - chocolate ganache. The reason I gave it 4 stars was atmosphere and location. It's just a block from her Times Square chaos and the atmosphere is more stuffy than it is regal or fancy. No charm. Service was great , better be for how much the dinner was (not that I know) but one and done- don't think I need to come back here.

But the service was very helpful and the dining ambiance is really nice. They have an outdoor space if you actually despise crowds and look for a more urbane atmosphere. The menu is also very interesting. This is not a french place but definitely has some influence. The burger is one thing that everyone that has dined here could recommend although it is ginormous. Foie gras was nice and agnolotti were delish. As a desert i had the chocolate chestnut velout and it was perfect. I do recommend the scallops by the way, seafood is something that you should not miss @ Aureole. And make a reservation if you are a party of more than 2.

4.0,8/13/2014,"Came here for summer restaurant week 2014. I organized a group dinner here, and since we couldn't make reservations via open table for our large party, I called in. The staff members were very helpful. Note: they could only accommodate up to 8 people max at one table for restaurant week. I ended up having to change the reservation number several times, but they were really nice about it. They did require I leave a credit card number so that in case no one showed up for the reservation AND I didn't call in to cancel our table, we would have been charged $25 per no show.Food was great -- portions were HUGE. the cavaatelli pasta was amazing, and even though it's an appetizer, it's about the size of an entree. The chicken was also like 2 entrees size. The pesto risotto looked really green when it arrived, but it was extremely delicious. I would not recommend the gazpacho soup; I have yet to find a restaurant who makes gazpacho soup to my taste...Also had the green with envy cocktail; very summery drink and tasted like cucumbers, if you're into that.

3.0,8/12/2014,"My sister and I came here really excited after reading all the reviews on yelp and were quite disappointed.  I'm not sure if it was just because of restaurant week menu or if the quality of food has just gone down but I found most of our dishes to be bland and tasteless or just ok. We started with the cavatelli pasta and salad.  The salad was fine it was just a regular salad - I find salads to just be rabbit food I don't care for it so that's on me.  However the cavatelli pasta was a big disappointment, all the main ingredients were there but they seemed to forget the salt and pepper.  What should have been a flavorful mix of smoked ricotta, peas onions and pasta was a completely bland mix of different textures.  Actually the only flavorful part was the little bulb onions which appeared to be pickled.  Apps I'd give a 2/5For our entrees we got the free range chicken and risotto - both were just ok. The risotto could have been a bit creamier.  On the upside the chicken was tender and juicy.  Entrees I'd give a solid 3/5. For dessert we had the chocolate cake which was probably the best part of our meal - 4/5 for this.  I wasn't able to finish mine and my sister refused to let it go to waste because it is that good!As for the service from the second we walked in the door to the second we left the staff was attentive and friendly. Everything about the restaurant itself demands 5 star attention it was just unfortunate that their menu didn't live up to it.",0,0,0,Fatima H.,"Forest Hills, NY",296,247,330
4.0,8/7/2014,"Came here during restaurant week, which I've heard can be a hit or miss affair. Many restaurant staff loathe restaurant week customers and a lot of restaurants see it as an opportunity to serve up a watered down menu in order to rake in some profits. So I'm told. But I figured as someone who sometimes lives by the mantra, ""ballin' on a budget"", Michelin star dining for a fraction of the price was right up my alley. Decor: Aureole's decor is pretty modern looking, which is good if you're into that sort of thing. Personally I find it lacking in warmth. It has the feel of dining in a board room. The bright lights of the theater district complement this feel, which I suspect is one of the reasons (I'm sure cost was also a contributing factor) why this new location is appointed so differently from the pictures I've seen of the wood paneling, plush carpeting and dark interior of Aureole's previous home inside an upper-East side townhouse (which apparently was also home to Orson Welles!)Service: Service was very good however it was few and far between. I'll attribute that to the fact that the restaurant was stuffed to the gills with fellow RWers and the staff was spread pretty thin. I noticed they mainly focused their attention on larger groups and those who weren't ordering off the RW menu, which if I were in their shoes, I'd have done as well (gotta get that $$$). When they did come over to us though they were very polite and friendlier than I'd expected. Appetizer: Having been forewarned about RW offerings I'd tempered by expectations but I was happy to find most everything was delicious. My heirloom tomato gazpacho had a wonderful pop of flavor, and it was also pretty right up to the point where the avocado was added (tableside) and turned it into a sorta goopy mess. I tried a bite of my friend's cavatelli pasta, which with its smoked ricotta, smelled amazing. However the taste had absolutely NONE of the smokiness you'd expect from the smell-- a bit of a letdown. Entree: The real standout for me was the grilled free-range chicken. I was literally expecting some haute version of grilled chicken breast, tiny and fancily plated. Imagine my delight when they set half a chicken in front of me. I'm certain that whatever grilling took place (if any) was brief, likely to sear. This tasted more like oven roasted chicken basted generously with butter. But however they did it, no complaints from me because it tasted phenomenal. It literally melted. You could cut it with a spoon. Well done. I tried a bite of the summer vegetable risotto as well, which was good, but I think was intended as a less hearty offering. Flavor-wise, after experiencing the chicken, the risotto will pale in comparison. If you're doing restaurant week, you can't go wrong with the chicken. Trust. Dessert: Our meal was followed up by a 7-layer (we counted 6) chocolate cake served with a quenelle of peanut butter ice cream (though the online RW menu specifies berry sorbet) and cocoa dusted hazelnuts atop a bed of salted caramel. The cake by itself was just okay, but paired with everything else on the plate-- outstanding. They should get in touch with someone at Ben & Jerry's because I'd eat that peanut butter ice cream with the salted caramel and hazelnuts by the pint if I could (I'm classy like that). I was disappointed there was so little of it. All in all, not a bad foray into restaurant week. Not by any means.",5,4,2,Simon P.,"New York, NY",102,184,37

3.0,8/5/2014,"weekday, 8pm3 peopleSummer 2014 restaurant week dinnerThere were 3 choices for appetizer and entree and 2 choices for dessert, so our group tried everything on their menu.My order was cavatelli (great!), fish cake (ok), melon sorbet kinda stuff (not good.. I'd rather have those fruit plates from dimsum).Cavatelli was sooo good. It tasted a lot like carbonara. This is a pretty big portion for appetizer, and also a heavy dish because of the cream. I loved it though, and I'd order it again! The other two appetizers were gazpacho and salad. I had the fish cake which was ok, nothing special, will not order this again. The sweet pea risotto looked very refreshing and came out as an appetizing and beautiful green. Huge props to Aureole for their free range chicken though! It was amazing. I haven't seen a portion this huge at a restaurant in a very long time. The amazing part is how the chef managed to keep the chicken meat juicy, tender, and flavorful. The last thing you want is dry chicken on your plate (esp in huge portions).One person from our table ordered the chocolate cake and he finished it without realizing, so I'd say it was a good cake. The fruit dessert was very underwhelming and neither of us finished ours. Best combination to order in terms of tastiness not portion: cavatelli (appetizer -- heavy and slightly large portion), free range chicken (entree -- large portion), and chocolate cake (dessert -- heavy).Liberty Room - very wheelchair friendly, there were no steps from the sidewalk to door, and no steps inside the restaurant, evenly-spaced aisle and space between tables, should be ok to maneuver around",0,1,0,Tiffany C.,"Midtown East, Manhattan, NY",6,23,2

4.0,7/31/2014,"My job had their Christmas party here a couple years ago but I wasn't heavily Yelping back then, so no review. I do remember it being very pleasant and the food being good.However, I did come here again this week for lunch. I intended to visit for Restaurant Week 2014 but was told upon arrival that they only participate in Restaurant Week for dinner. My co-worker and I decided to stay for the 2 course (for $38) lunch menu anyway since we were already there.Very pleasant experience. Comfortable seating, very nice staff. We both ordered the same thing - chilled fava bean soup with crab (delicious and refreshing) and the sea bass. The sea bass was cooked well but I didn't love the sauce - it was overwhelmingly lemony. The focaccia bread was delicious so make sure you try that. It is very salty though which I love. The bread guy came around regularly so we had 3 servings of bread (hey don't judge, they were small plates so needed to fill up on bread). Then, out of nowhere, the waitress brought us dessert and said it was complimentary, apologizing for the Restaurant Week mix-up. It wasn't really a mix-up or a mistake on their part, at least that was not my impression. I hope not because in that case, we got ripped off for lunch!

4.0,7/29/2014,"This is a review for restaurant week, held in the Liberty Room of the restaurant.Restaurant Week is a hit-or-miss. Aureole falls into the hit category. The restaurant itself is beautiful: modern, sophisticated, sleek, and airy with high ceilings that showcase the chandeliers and the wine cellar. A surprisingly quiet and classy atmosphere so close to Times Square, and manages to not be uncomfortable or snooty. Onto the food...THE BREAD: A nice setup of wooden bowls with 4 different types of breads, served with a lovely large pat of butter because butter makes everything better. My friend asked for some olive oil, which was easily accommodated. The rosemary focaccia was yummy, a tad salty but fluffy and chewy. Avoid the temptation to try all 4 breads and save room for the large portions.GAZPACHO:  This dish appears on (too) many RW menus. I'm usually not a fan, but the gazpacho was one of the better ones I've tasted. It is presented as a puree, and the waiter pours the soup base in. Visually, it was admittedly prettier before the soup went in... the puree became a bit of a frothy mess and separated in the soup. However, the croutons were petite and satisfyingly crunchy, the flavor had more depth than other gazpachos, and it was a very clean and light beginning to the meal. CAVATELLI: A shell-shaped pasta that resembles hotdog buns (according to wiki). It was made with a white sauce -- I believe carbonara? Creamy and smoky in a bacon way. Topped with finely shaved parmesan for a little salty bite. It was solid and traditional, a bit of a safe choice but prepared well. Definitely order this if you're hungry-- it's a heavy beginning, and a large portion.CHICKEN: Half a chicken. Plated up and ready to be devoured, with a side of colorful potatoes. This was an astonishingly large portion (altogether we had 2 whole chickens on our table). It was some of the juiciest, tender chicken I've ever had. The flavor was not particularly wowing, but it was well-seasoned. It is the best of both worlds of light and dark meat. Definitely recommend.CHOCOLATE CAKE: Everyone went for the 7-layer chocolate cake with peanut butter ice cream, salted caramel, and cocoa-dusted hazelnuts. It tasted just as good as it sounds. A grown-up version of your favorite candybars all on one plate. A playful and delicious combination of sweet and savory. I appreciated that the cake was not overly heavy or sweet, and the ice cream was airy and captured the pb essence. Plus, the plate was beautiful to look at. Overall, I would go back. The food is solid, traditional albeit not the most inventive or exciting. The service is attentive and not overbearing, and the space is nice enough to take the parents to.For more reviews, check out my blog at: lilmoosetracks.wordpress…",8,2,2,Lillian Y.,"Brooklyn, NY",461,285,1300

Yes, there are lights outside of restaurants in Times Square.... SHOCKER!!!  Anyway... on to my experience....I wanted to  go to Aureole because I have a friend who works there, but when we looked at the menu, we realized it may be a little out of our price range. Then a beautiful thing happened on our trip... RESTAURANT WEEK! And magically we were able to afford to go to this place, and thank goodness we did!!This is one of the nicest places I have ever been. We did restaurant week, so we got the three course meal. Before the meal even came, the bread did, and it was amazing! I had to struggle not to fill up on the bread!My appetizer was gazpacho with avocado. It was heavenly. I am not generally a fan of gazpacho, but decided to try some new things at this place, and I am so glad I did! It was creamy, tasty, and the avocado and sprinkle of croutons were perfect. My meal was the summer vegetable risotto. This was my least favorite of what we got, and still it was delicious! It was different than any risotto I have had, and the veggies were present but not overpowering. Friends that got the lemon chicken made me jealous, because that chicken was amazing. My dessert was the chocolate cake. And while the cake was delicious, the garnishes were even better! It was served with a creamy peanut butter ice cream and hazelnuts. Superb! The best part of Aureole is the service. Everyone there is welcoming, you have many people coming to your table to clean, fill water, ect. I like that when you get up to go to the bathroom your napkin is folded for you upon return.

Most of wine is pomp and circumstance. When you are paying 2-4x retail put on a show for us. The sommelier was pushing and pouring wine like it was free. I hate when restaurant wine service commands this. It takes the class out of dinning. It cheapens the whole experience. I have said this many times throughout the years.Service- Professionally absent. I have never seen so many professionally dressed and acting servers standing around and talking. Thank goodness for Darrel the busboy who practically took care of everything. It took for ever for the server to take our order. I had to ask for bread. I had to ask for more bread etc.Bathrooms- four unisex units. I'm not sure if I like thatTable Bread- Excellent. Focaccia, wheat, white selections. Food How do you run out of the gnudi appetizer at 6;30 in the evening? Poor planningCrab amuse bouche was refreshingPink shrimp appetizer was OK. The shrimp were sweet and delicious. But the pumpkin faro ""risotto"" was too heavy and overpowered the dish. Also the foam. Oh how I hate foam. Not only is it off putting visually but it is so passe. Ricotta gnocchi- first dish was served cold. Returned for a hot version. The presentation was outstanding! And the gnocchi were very good but not as award winning as the plating. Nice pomp and circumstance with the pouring of the broth.You need dinner theater at top notch restaurants to offset the expensive prices.Caramelized sea scallops- The presentation was off putting and disappointing. It looked like the scallops were run over by a truck. But the taste of the saffron agrodolce sauce was outstanding! Beef three ways- Braised Beef cheek, ribeye, marrow. Outstanding presentation! Again with the pouring of the broth. Beef cheeks were ordinary, ribeye was good but unidentifiable as ribeye in taste and appearance. Desserts:Meyer lemon, basil parfait is complex in flavor profiles. Skip itChocolate three ways parfait is excellentOverall- Charlie Palmer's place is hanging on by a thread. The food presentations are the focal point. They are some of the most visually appealing in the restaurant business. But on this night the whole dinner orchestration was off.

Luckily this ended up being the case, but I thought it was weird after specifically asking if we had a time constraint.My mom and I both got the fluke tartar and my cousin got the beet salad. The fluke was interesting--it had a whipped creamy sauce on top and orange juice on the bottom. Kinda a strange combo that didn't quite work and was different from the description online.

2.0,3/1/2014,"I booked a reservation in the Bar Room for Restaurant Week. Should have cross checked the restaurant week menu with the real dinner menu as I would have seen that nothing from the restaurant week menu is actually on the real restaurant menu. *rookie mistake*The appetizer course was unimpressive. The fluke tartare had a creamy green top layer and was served in a bowl of orange juice. Orange juice+cream = creamsicle. It was a fish creamsicle. The pasta appetizer was good, but pretty standard (as in, I'm not even a great cook but could whip up something similar). The main courses were pretty good. The veal chop was tender and served on top of a strong mustard sauce with white beans. Even though this dish was good, it actually tasted a bit like grilled hot dogs with baked beans. The pearl barley risotto had a delicious sauce, but the vegetables were watery, and barley is just a poor choice for a risotto. Barley is slimy. Slimy risotto.The dessert course - dulcey panna cotta - was a big portion and silky smooth. Overall, the meal was just okay. The service was nice but inattentive. The pacing of the meal was extremely slow. Normally, that wouldn't have been a problem.

4.0,2/20/2014,"Aureole is one of the quiet classics; the Charlie Palmer flagship restaurant situated in the Bank of America Tower has been serving up refined and elegant plates for a quarter of a century. Their consistency has ensured them a Michelin star for the past string of years, not a small accomplishment given the ever-changing dining scene in NYC. The best opportunity I had to visit was on a Friday in between holidays; a nearly-empty office coupled with one of the brightest winter days was the perfect setting for a leisurely lunch.Located only a few blocks from Times Square, the entrance to Aureole is almost impossible to miss. The floor-to-window ceilings allow passers-by to peer inside and if the first impression is not enough of an impact, a quick glance at the menu prices would immediately throw off any unsuspecting tourist. The best deal is for the weekday lunch, however, where a three course prix-fixe is only $36. Upon entering, I was immediately greeted by the smiling hostess and led over to our table in the dining room. The interior in Aureole is very modern, chic, and very much screams ""corporate""; indeed, most of the diners inside looked to be employees who work from within the very same tower.After we had taken a few bites of the complimentary bread, we began our meal with the Cod Brandade, an emulsion of cod and cauliflower that has a wonderfully creamy and fluffy texture that I can best liken to mashed potatoes. Ours was lightly drizzled with saffron vinaigrette, which added a lightly acidic aftertaste to each bite, and topped with a handful of croutons, which gave each forkful a hearty crunch to balance out the texture. Despite not being a big seafood fan, I can honestly say that I enjoyed this dish. The cod wasn't overwhelmingly fishy and the portion size was just right for an appetizer.Our plates were quickly cleared and our entrees followed. Once again, we both ordered the same dish: Stout Braised Beef Brisket. It was gorgeously presented: a sizable portion of beef brisket was plated next to a colorful pile of root vegetables. The vegetables were satisfactory; they were indeed fresh, with a good crunch, and plenty of flavor. The star of the meal was clearly the brisket, however. Fall-off-the-fork tender, with plenty of both lean and fatty pockets of meat, it had clearly been braised for many hours. I wasn't amazed by the flavor, however, as it was fairly one-dimensional; the sauce need some other taste besides ""salty"".And, of course, dessert. Two options were available to us that day, so we ordered one of each to share. The cheesecake was a bit of a disappointment; it was too dense and seemingly hastily paired with drops of cherry-flavored syrup. The Frozen Lemon Mousse, on the other hand, was clearly the winner. Intricately plated, the mousse was surrounded by an orange tuile. I also loved the additional pieces of lightly charred grapefruit, orange, and nectarine. The citrus flavors were matched perfectly and the overall presentation made it an enjoyable dessert to share.As a whole, I satisfied with my meal at Aureole. Though there are a few small nuances that could use a little alteration (at least, in my own personal opinion), the overall experience is sure to please any diner.",8,5,6,Lori L.,"New York, NY",2244,608,6827

The waitress was very informative about mostly everything on the menu and answered all my questions .

For our second course we had seared scallops and black cod .. It was very delicious as well ! The servers presented our food in a professional manner and the presentation of the food was lovely . The bus boys cleared our dishes quickly as soon as they spotted an empty dish and one guy even picked up a spinach I accidentally dropped on the table with how bare hands and wiped the table with a cloth when he spotted it ! The environment seemed very calm and relaxing .. I felt like I was dining all fancy with my rose champagne and red wine . For dessert I had a chocolate mousse cake ? With straw candy that looked like a birds nest, chocolate and thyme ice cream with fudge drizzled on the bottom . (Sorry I'm really bad with remembering the names) It was very sweet and delicious .. It definitely satisfied my sweet tooth . Although, I have to say they should give more ice cream because the chocolate was very sweet and the candy straws were stuck on my teeth . The bad things I can say about this restaurant is that I had to wait quite some time to get the next dish and had to wait and look around for the waitress to come back and request for things .. The restaurant wasn't packed ! Oh and the bathrooms are confusing ..

2.0,9/5/2013,"This was one of my worst fine dining experiences.  The food was decent although pretty unmemorable, but when you're paying these prices you're paying for much more than food and all the intangibles were missing.   We did the ""cheap"" $55 three-course pre-theater menu and got the distinct impression from  the restaurant that we were second class citizens because we were not paying ""full price.""  We've dined at lots of fancy and Michelin starred restaurants and our bill is usually quite a bit less than average because we don't drink alcohol, regularly order a la carte at places that have tasting menus, etc and I've never been made to feel like anything other than a very valued guest.  That was not the case here.When we arrived, the maitre d asked us if we were doing the prix fixe menu or if we wanted to ""order a la carte"" in the bar area.  We said we were doing the prix fixe, because we wanted the theater prix fixe (and I was not really aware of the fact that they had another prix fixe; I knew they had a more expensive tasting menu).   We were led into a beautifully decorated dining room with soft lighting and lots of flowers.  However, when were presented with our menus, we realized the menu was for a $89 three-course prix fixe and there was no theater menu.   When we asked about it, the waitress explained that the pre-theater menu was served in the bar room, and after consulting with the maitre d, we were moved there to have the theater menu.   I was very embarrassed because I felt like the mix-up was my fault, but to their credit the staff was very nice about it.    The move would have been no problem if we were taken to another dining room.  But instead, we had to sit in the bar area.  Maybe our negative impression of it was amplified because we had just seen the beautiful main dining room, but it had no ambiance or decor to speak of, was incredibly LOUD and had very hard, uncomfortable seats.   I realize its not the restaurant's fault we saw both rooms but it was like booking a hotel, being given a tour of the Four Seasons and then finding out your room is in a Motel 6.   $55 a person (+ tax and tip) may be cheap for this restaurant, but its still a lot to pay for a meal and for that price I don't think its unreasonable to expect to have my meal in an ambiance where I can hear my husband talk and where I have a comfortable seat.The theater prix fixe menu matched the one online.  3 courses, 2 or 3 choices for each course.  We started with some bread and butter.  The bread was below average and the butter was really cold (pet peeve of mine: I hate when its not spreadable).   For our apps, my husband had a rock shrimp dish.  He was really not a fan of it and said it had a spiciness he did not expect or like.  I had a chilled carrot soup with duck rillette.  It was ok but nothing special.  For our entrees, my husband had the steak, which he enjoyed and I had the salmon.  It was cooked perfectly to my requested medium well (thoroughly cooked but still very juicy) and I liked the accompaniments of gnocchi and corn (although don't mistake this for a healthy dish - the main ingredient in the dish appeared to be butter).    For desserts, my husband had the vanilla panna cotta which he really liked, and I had the croustillant de chocolate.  It was too sweet for me, but ok.  It was a mousse-like chocolate cake on top of a crispy praline layer.  There was chocolate ice cream on the side but it had a weird texture (too icy).  The highlight of the dessert for me was the salty caramel sauce drizzled on the plate.   The most memorable part of the meal for me was the salmon, and honestly that dish would be very easy to replicate at home.Service was polished and smooth but not at all friendly.   Actually, other than taking our order (for all 3 courses upfront), I don't think our waiter spoke to us at all.  I don't recall anyone asking how we liked each dish.  Courses were not presented with any explanation of what they were.One of the things that annoys me the most is ""deals"" that are actually not a good value.  I think the pre-theater menu here is probably a worse value than the regular $89 prix fixe when you factor in ambiance, and the fact that you get no amuses, petit fours, etc on the theater menu (based on Yelp reviews, it seems like you get several on the regular prix fixe).  Plus, you have way more selection for each course on the $89 prix fixe.   Some may think I'm being naive and a meal this ""cheap"" at a restaurant of this caliber will inherently get you the ""budget experience"" but I disagree - Jean-Georges' $38 lunch prix fixe is an example of a deal where you pay significantly less than the normal price and get not only the same food but the same dining experience. Overall:Food - 3 stars (assuming you like standard, not very creative American/French dishes)Ambiance - 1 star in the bar room (where you have to eat to have the pre-theater menu)Service - 2 starsValue - 1 star (for pre-theate",10,1,0,A M.,"West Lafayette, IN",856,1301,8
5.0,8/31/2013,I would have to rate this experience a 5 star.Food was a 4-4.5. The  food was well prepared and executed but not overly creative or out of the box. We were excited for the foie gras (terrine and seared) since we live in California and no longer get to enjoy foie gras. Our disappointment came from the restaurant catering to more business people with less foodie experience. Since I look at a dinner experience to be entertainment I was a bit disappointed with the lack of flexibility.  When I articulated my disappointment we were kindly greeted and they stated they would talk to the chef and do their best to accommodate.  We were well taken care of and the experience was amazing.

4.0,8/20/2013,"4 girls at Aureole for Restaurant Week dinner.  After a few drinks at happy hour nearby, we decided to come to the restaurant early for another drink.  The bar was filled with men on Blackberry and iPhones who graciously got up and magically made 4 seats at the bar for us.  DEFINITELY a ""finance guy"" hangout...which is pretty explainable as it's in the Bank of America building.  The drinks and service at the bar was great.  Drinks were delicious.  Great looking restaurant.  The hostess was able to seat us early and led us to a nice table in the bar room (only the bar room participates in Restaurant Week) and the choices were simply delicious.  I started with a mushroom cavatelli pasta that was such a large portion, it could have been my main course.  It was done perfectly (but at that point, I was pretty full).  However, my entree of then the pork loin came out and it was absolutely spectacular.  Still on the bone and perfectly cooked, I somehow polished off the whole thing AND ate dessert.  Now I have to diet for a week, but it was all worth it.  I do have to nitpick about the table we were seated at... yes the Bar Room is a bit crowded and loud (which is fine) but we were sitting at a table with 1 side of bench style seating and 1 side of chair.  All of us girls are the same height and, when we sat down, the 2 sitting on the bench were comically low to the table.  It was pretty hilarious and they looked like they needed booster seats and were uncomfortable all night long.",3,2,0,Diane C.,"Hoboken, NJ",244,531,7

The avocado tasted really fresh -- I could not have been happier with this appetizer.

I read many reviews on Yelp and found many negative reviews especially for the RW experiences. I was worried but I will give it a try anyway.Firstly other perople say the RW menu is only served in the bar room, crowded and noisy, apparently not a suitable place to taste the meal as long as I am concerned. Surprisingly, my friends and I were seated in the dinning room, a quiet and comfortable place. The lights are just light enough to see everything and create an elegant environment. Get your date here!Secondly they say with RW orders no bread is offered. We got them maybe because we are in the dinning room.Thirdly they complain service is really terrible and servers ignore customers. I believe thanks to the dinning room again we got good service.So if you want to enjoy a great meal and service you definitely need to go to the dinning room, not the bar room.

Started with the Braised Lamb Tortellini, Bing Cherry, Pecan, Grilled Trevisano.  It was very good, but lacked great flavor. A slight disappointment. The bread was superb.  I generally prefer my bread warm, but it was so delicious, I had multiple servings of an excellent  focaccia and sour dough.  The  baguette was great too. For the main course, I had the Roasted Rack of Lamb, English Pea, Fava Bean, Caramelized Young Onion.  This we perfection.  Superb seasoning and the most tender delicious, medium rare piece of lamb.  For dessert, I had the excellent Vacherin,Chocolate, Coffee Maringue, Dulcey Mousse.  It was a work of art. Very good, but not the sort of dessert worth dreaming of.  Also, the portions are more small to medium size rather than the larger portions of chocolate dessert that I prefer. The decor is lovely, especially in the more formal back room. The service was generally very attentive. Still after our meal, we were not offered petits fours as many other tables seemed get.  I am not sure if this was an oversight or not, but I consider such to be an essential ending to any expensive five star meal.  Also, some tables seem to have been offered a wrapped dessert or pastry item.  We were not brought any.  Not sure if that was an oversight or not, but would have been a nice touch and I vaguely remember getting something on a past visit.It is still one of the best restaurants near the center of the world (aka Times Square).",1,0,1,Randall S.,"Manhattan, NY",837,109,13

4.0,7/25/2013,"Disclaimer: I came for the Summer 2013 restaurant week and ordered off a RW menu, which changes seasonally so you might find this review completely useless. You might also find this review downright offensive and boring.Actually, knowing most of my reviews, it will probably turn out completely useless and offensive anyways. Here goes...The Yelp location marker is wrong. Aureole is located between AofA and Broadway, not between 7th and 8th ave. So I came with my gang of Asian friends and we were sat in the bar room, which was exclusively for the restaurant week guests. It was crowded, it was loud, and it was predictably full'o'Asians. We were lead to our table by a host who reminded me of Jason Segel. Fanny Pak* was already there. She was in a white dress and looked beautiful. I blushed.I looked around for stuff to mention on Yelp. Huge wine mezzanine. Spiral orange lights. Tightly packed bar. White daisy on every table (but will probably look nicer in Fanny Pak's hair). A noticeably quieter dining room beneath the mezzanine for non-RW week guests. I will be them one day and impress Fanny Pak.Jing ordered wine by the glass (17) and Kenny ordered the Aureole cocktail (12). The Aureole cocktail was magenta and looked girly as hell. Fanny Pak asked for a sip and seemed to like it. I thought she was allergic to alcohol. Either she's a lying bitch or the tiny portion of Ketel One did nothing. I hate Kenny. For appetizers I went for the Gazpacho with poached shrimp. The tomato base was sweet and a tiny sour, giving it a concentrated taste. The poached shrimp was simple and refreshing. Tiny bits of cantaloupes gave it a nice flair. Overall refreshing but straightforward. My future girlfriend got the cavatelli pasta. The pasta was tough and the flavor was flat. It was however a sizeable portion. Braised pork shank. The presentation looked like shit but that piece of meat was huge. With just minimal facilitation by utensils and all the meat was entirely separated from the bone. Tender and unadulerated pork in mysterious sauce and crushed potatoes... so good! Julie got the salmon and allowed me a taste. It could use more moisture. I also noticed the size of the salmon for the four people in our group who got it varied greatly. Fanny Pak finished her large portion of braised pork easily. I like a girl who finishes her meat. Dessert I got the [fancy French word] chocolat. I understood that meant chocolate. My fiance-to-be was not impressed. Extremely thick chocolate with a sheet of waffers and a spoonful of chocolate icecream on the side is as good as it sounds and you shouldn't need further descriptions here. I felt my stomach bulge up after the last bite. Fanny Pak did not look like she liked chubby guys. Service was per michelin standards. There was a short Asian phd-student looking nerdy waiter guy so that was pretty cool right? You go stereotype breaker Asian guy! Although the service was extremely detailed, it wasn't very personable and nobody really checked up on us. They were however quick to take initiatives on replacing dropped utensils, changing out plates, and refilling water. All which were done without you noticing. It might have been because I was too busy noticing someone else.I was torn between 3 or 4 stars. If held on a michelin standard, the less than impressive appetizers and salmon would have justified a 3 (which is still good in my opinion!). But dat pork shank ... arghhh! For the 38 dollar restaurant week, I felt the meal was worth the splurge.* Fanny Pak read this review and not only did she not jump into my loving embrace el pronto she commanded me to edit out her real first name which she deems ""unique""",5,14,5,Qian W.,"Queens, NY",327,349,61

4.0,7/8/2013,"Definitely a nice place for a business lunch - good thing I wasn't paying for it.I made a reservation on Opentable, and mistakenly made the reservation for the dining room instead of the bar room. Changed it to the bar room during the confirmation call on Sunday, and again when we arrived since it was in the notes, but the system had not been switched over, but sadly, was unable to get the open table points because the hostess informed me that the systems are separate and all they could do is cancel the reservation. Boo-hoo, no 100 points for me.Atmosphere:Very nice, classy, clean open space. The bar room and dining room are not as separated/different as in other restaurants. There is a screen between the two areas and the dining room is a bit darker and has tablecloth. The bathrooms are quite dark, but clean and comfortable.The food:Pre-Fixe lunch ($36/pp) is definitely a good deal, especially given the rest of the prices on the menu. The menu on the website is not accurate, and hasn't been updated, so my pre-arrival selections were rendered moot. - Got the smoked salmon app, which was very nice and refreshing. My companions got the fish (halibut?) croquette, which were 3 nicely sized fried balls of fish (and cheese?). They seemed to really enjoy it, comparing it to a really delicious fish stick. - Got a fois gras to share, and while it was good with a nice creamy texture, and had a beautiful croissant cake thingy. That being said, I preferred the fois gras appetizer at Jean Georges in terms of taste/texture. - The entree of hanger steak was beautifully seasoned and cooked to a perfect medium rare (not bleeding, but clearly red in the middle). The grilled corn and something puree was also a nice touch, although I could have used a bit more puree. It looks like a small portion, but I was decently full at the end of it.- The pineapple carppacio dessert was interesting, but the coconut panna cotta really stood out and made the dish delicious. The service:Very nice - the servers were polite, attentive, but not overbearing. My water glass was never empty and they delivered the food and removed the plates with precision. This is definitely a place to take someone to be impressed. The food was very good, the atmosphere was great, and the service was also top notch.

4.0,4/12/2013,"Visited during Winter 2013 Restaurant Week. How did I forget to write a review? This is for the Bar Room, by the way.I love the decor of the Bar Room. Wine everywhere! And the feel of the Bar Room was more relaxed than I imagine the main dining room to be. Lively, lots of chatter. I didn't feel awkward or uncomfortable, which is always nice.Food was great, service was meh, but I'll give them the benefit of the doubt and chalk it up to the busy RW season. I'm always hesitant to go to a finer dining restaurant during RW because I know I'm probably not going to get the full experience. I did thumb through the non-RW menu, and it seemed interesting enough to visit again. So... tentative 4 stars until I return on a non-RW day and see what the real deal is.",0,0,0,Amanda L.,"Denver, CO",127,296,0
4.0,4/12/2013,"We had a reservation in the dinning room at 7:30 on a Tuesday night.  My friend got there a bit earlier around 7 and there was a table ready for us.  When I arrived, the bar scene wasn't as crowded (but somewhat loud).  I thought to myself, I'm glad we had a reservation in the dinning room if we are going to experience this gourmet dinner.Dinning room is a bit smaller than I envisioned.  It felt crowded with several waiters walking around, but it's still an elegant dinning room nonetheless.  The crowds were a mixed of businessmen and older couples.  You would have thought it would be filled with tourists since it's in Times Square, but the bar area had a different vibe than the dinning room.  It had a younger crowd and a bit more upbeat.  Food ... Dinning room only offers 3 courses prix-fixe and tasting menu.  We went with 3 courses because we were short on time.  Our palette was freshen up with an amuse bouche, King crab salad.  The presentation was beautiful and King crab tasted very fresh.  My first course was King crab pumpkin soup, omg! it was so very very tasty, flavorful, and very light.  It was probably a highlight of my meal.  Second course was Dry Aged Ribeye, this was okay, it could use some more seasoning.  Black truffles, however was fulled of flavors which made up for that bland flavor of the ribeye.  Third course was Raspberry Lychee Mousse.  Unfortunately, I didn't get to take my time and enjoy this dessert :(   We had to rush our waiter for the desert and a bill because we had to catch a train at Grand Central and head back home.  Overall, service was great, ambiance was nice, I definitely didn't feel like I was anywhere near Times Square.  I would gladly visit Aureole again.",2,0,0,Kim S.,"Stamford, CT",206,235,454
4.0,4/10/2013,"This place is top brass, super-swank for midtown.

Though we were a bit underdressed (you can expect everyone in the place to be dressed like financial C-suite) the service and presentation was spectacular. The fixed menu was a bit of a surprise but had something for everyone. Amazing Foie Gras at Aureole, probably the best I have ever had. But their Manhattan left something to be desired.

I pounded an Airbornne, Energency C and also a Ziacam within minutes of leaving. No music or ambiance, even the flowers looked as if they were picked off a grave stone.

2.0,3/21/2013,"I have been to some really nice places before, and usually you feel like you are getting what you pay for - maybe not directly in terms of food (because the food at a lot of top restaurants is really all good) but you get the feeling in the decor and service and other aspects.  For the prices that this restaurant charges, they really should be giving larger portions - and I dont typically ever complain about portion size.  I wasnt paying for this meal, but I thought that the prices were really excessive for the size of the dishes.  I got a pumpkin soup with a tiny amount of king crab meat, which was ok, but at $16 it should have been great (at that price you can typically get a really good lobster bisque at a lot of higher end restaurants).  The black squid ink pasta with peeky toe crab was nice, but I have had better and it was really really small.  There was literally maybe 8 small strands of pasta and I ate it in less than 5 min - this was a $24 entree.  It is lunch, so I understand portions are on the smaller side (and I typically never complain about portions because I feel like most restaurants give you too much), but this was really ridiculous given the prices.  And the worst part was that nothing was what you would consider to be really good, it was just ok... Back to the decor, its a nice place, but the tables are squeezed together tight for a place that caters to the business crowd (who typically need more space).  Luckily it was not very crowded, so it didnt matter.  The service was good.",0,0,0,Rakesh M.,"Manhattan, NY",25,217,11

Had I tried the food, I might be writing otherwise, but here goes:Walked in on a Tuesday night and the place was packed, we were told that there was a 2 1/2 hour wait for a table, but that we could sit at the bar and have something to eat there. The bar, however, was equally packed and the bartender gave us attitude for wanting to even look at a dinner menu, so we decided to just have a couple of drinks and leave. The drinks also took forever to make, even though they were pretty basic. The place did look nice; they have an amazing wine wall w/excellent selection, but I guess I'm just a little bitter due to my personal experience and basically walking out of a restaurant hungry.

3.0,3/9/2013,"RW Winter 2013 Reviews:It's a little late.. but better be late than never.. :) Since Aureole received 1 Michelin star.. I have always been wanting to try.. I know they do RW so I chose to save some money and wait for the month of RW..So here it is.. Is pretty difficult to get a reservation with a good timing.. 8.30pm for dinner was slightly late for me but oh well.. Let's head straight to the food..I was pretty upset that I was being seated at a corner of the bar room.. Bar room was slightly packed compare to the main dining room.. well.. obviously the main dining room is used to serve customer with the normal $$$ menu..There are 3 options in appetizer, entree, and desserts.. Since we both love meat so much... we just go with the other 2 options that are not vegetarian.. so with that being said:Appetizer:- i went with the tuna tartare.. The tuna wasn't fresh as some yelpers mentioned that's why they used it to make tartare.. I loved the taro chips on top of it.. Portion was slightly small but I guess it's a good way to start..- Pasta.. It was pretty good but nothing special about it.. I was expecting a little more since it's a Michelin restaurantEntree:- Salmon.. It's interesting that the salmon was topped with some green sauce.. I think it's medium rare - medium cooked.. I think salmon you can have it anywhere.. but no doubt that since it's from a good restaurant.. The salmon was pretty fresh but just not up to what I expected..- braised chicken.. It's some sort of asian fusion entree? I always dislike fusion but the chicken breast was braised till perfection.. It comes with some chinese spinach with it so you can have some greens with it.. the sauce was a little spicy.. it adds a kick to the chicken.. I actually prefer the chicken than the salmon..Dessert:I am surprised the dessert portion was huge.. almost the same size as the entree in my opinion..- pineapple coconut panna cotta.. The panna cotta in it has pineapple which makes it unique.. This is my first time having coconut panna cotta instead of vanilla.. It was great..- Chocolate eclair.. It's a huge eclair.. nothing too special.. but since chocolate is my favorite.. nothing can goes wrong with it as my dessert..I was upset because I did not get the bread basket as everyone does.. The waiter did not give us the full attention such as other tables.. also.. the food was not up to what I expected in this RW season.. I think I can get the same kind of food in other restaurant as well..but overall.. 3.5 stars.. leaning towards 3 because of the service..",1,0,0,Shing Yiing O.,"Manhattan, NY",384,624,603

Expect smaller portions but the quality is great. We did the tasting menu and were not let down. The wine list is quite extensive and our well-trained server spotted me struggling to choose. He asked if I would like to speak to the sommelier. I gave the sommelier some parameters (style, regions, oakiness, price, etc). He narrowed the huge list down to 2 bottles. I picked one and it was awesome. I even went home and ordered some online from the winery. The meal closed with some small dessert bites.

I usually take a lot pictures of my food but I decided to skip out on this dish. After I tried this dish my tongue was starting to hurt from all the saltiness! (compare it to when you eat too many sunflower seeds) The wild rice, mushrooms and bokchoy seemed like it was drenched in some kind of clear soy sauce. Coconut Panna Cotta :This was my favorite dish. I've had a Cotta from Morimoto and Strand Bistro recently and this was by far my favorite. The body of the Cotta was light and fluffy and the temperature and fresh mango on top make it feel like a ""fresh"" dish and it was the perfect dish to wash away to chase all the sodium I just consumed. water is going to be your bff here.",1,0,1,Colleen Y.,"Manhattan, NY",390,202,231
4.0,2/3/2013,"Aureole had never really interested me. There are restaurants in New York City that seem to earn Michelin stars based on something other than their food: the empty idealism of Rouge Tomate and the spiteful glitz of Gilt (which has subsequently closed, speaking to the culinary appeal of the place) come most prominently to mind. Given Aureole's location in the belly of the beast known as Bank of America's One Bryant Park Tower - the world's most environmentally friendly phallic object - I assumed that the new Aureole (it was formerly a townhouse type restaurant, a la JoJo) was in the vein of the latter breed. Happily, I was more or less wrong.Shortly after Esther and I checked our coats, we were asked to wait in the bar area while our table was prepared. Finding a space along the expanse of outward facing counter, we had scarcely browsed the drink menu before another waiter came, bearing our food menus. After explaining that we were meant to be shown to a table, he departed with a look expressing his incredulity that we would prefer not to attempt to eat our three courses on a seven inch deep slab of granite while sitting on stools. Thankfully, our less than auspicious beginnings were rectified by our service throughout the rest of the evening, starting with our waitress apologetically showing us to our table. We were situated on the outer rim of the bar area, yet the volume was still squarely on the loud side. Aureole looks rather large, but the semi-open area in the center of the room, with its preponderance of tables, serves as an echo chamber of sorts, amplifying the conversations therein to a dull roar that permeates the rest of the room. This is entirely odds with the other portion of the restaurant, which, while bedecked with enormous pendant lights of its own, feels upscale, refined, and most importantly, quiet. The dichotomy is, at times, palpable. For those nearer the bar, it must feel as though the entire waitstaff is in the dining room proper. Luckily, Esther and I were attended to by a fairly attentive waitress, but not everyone was so fortunate. But preferential treatment towards old money is far more palatable in light of well-executed food, and that rings as true at Aureole as anywhere.To begin, I chose the fettuccine. The braised veal was tender,  the wild mushrooms were plentiful, and the pasta was uniformly al dente. Esther's tuna tartare, if unspectacular, was still enjoyable, the taro crisp and ponzu subtle accents on an altogether mild dish. Our entrees were noticeably less understated. My Scottish salmon - its skin fried whole; a crispy lattice resting atop the meat; itself a pliant block of increasingly rare, succulent sheets - was bold in every aspect. The puree of watercress and lemon oil, served with a heavy hand,  altered the dynamic of the dish, from one of rustic ease and simplicity to a sylvan seascape, forest and fjord in equal measure. Esther's poached chicken, paired with wild rice and bok choy, carved in segments in a shallow pool of a ginger based reduction, was even more Chinese inspired than it sounded. For being poached, the chicken was shockingly piquant, and with the bok choy lending a slightly bitter vibrance to the pungent mushrooms and robust wild rice, it was a pleasantly balanced dish. Our desserts, much like our appetizers, were a bit less complex. However, what they lacked in profundity they made up for in their skillful consummation. My coconut panna cotta was technically flawless, and while I thought I could have done without the cilantro upon seeing it listed on the menu entry, I ended up appreciating its inclusion. Esther's chocolate eclair was a bit less nuanced, as all the elements ended up being fairly discrete, but each was good in its own right. The sorbet in particular merited praise on its airy texture, haphazardly lumped as it were on a bed of languid (in a delicious way) poached pears. As we retrieved our coats, I found it hard to quantify Aureole's place among the better restaurants in New York City. That is not to say it is undeserving, but abstruse. It is arguably fine dining, but it cannot escape its Times Square trappings. The food likewise occasionally transcends the most common claims against its progenitor, but on the whole, is safe, not exciting. But given that the safe dishes are well-prepared, and what little excitement is there is so because of flavor and not pure novelty, it is easier to like Aureole. While I may not be in a rush to return, per se, I certainly do not rue my having visited.",3,0,2,Jordan S.,"Manhattan, NY",865,273,672

4.0,1/21/2013,"We came here for restaurant week before our show. We got put into a small room with many other Asians. I wonder if it was a coincidence or was it because all Asians come out for restaurant week? Anyways for the appetizer I got the tuna tartare. The ponzu was very tasty but the grade of the tuna was not very high which is why it was tartare I guess but it was very chopped either. The braised veal breast with wild mushroom fettucine on the other hand was very good. However, it was a bit heavy for an appetizer. We then got our scottish salmon and the free range poached chicken. Both were very good. I think the salmon was better though. The chicken was good but for some reason the wild rice was very very salty. Dessert which is usually my favorite part of the meal was less than satisfactory. The chocolate eclair looked okay. The plating of the dessert was just ok, took forever to come out and was just very plain. There was nothing special about it and it wasn't over the top good but the ambience was nice, and all in all the food was pretty good. 3 stars for the food 5 stars for the service.Why? So, I needed to use the restroom and the server walked me to the bathroom yelling I HAVE A GUEST, MOVE! to all the people bringing out food and bringing in dishes creating a walkway for me to go to the bathroom, since I had to pass the kitchen to get there.

3.0,1/16/2013,"** THIS REVIEW IS FOR RESTAURANT WEEK ONLY **I work on 42nd and Madison, not too far from Aureole, so I wanted to check out what the fuss was about. I've read inconsistent reviews on yelp so I didn't want to risk paying the full menu price and decided to take advantage of Restaurant Week. I had reservations for 7:30pm (Wednesday) but my friend and I both arrived early. We checked in, hung up our coats and headed to the bar to kill time. There was one bartender- he was busy closing tabs and never looked up. Fortunately, our table was ready and we didn't have to wait long awkwardly by the bar next to a bunch of old men.My friend ordered a glass of Riesling and I had a Malbec (both $12). I later realized I should've checked out the menu before ordering because the malbec didn't pair well with my salmon. Oh well, I'm not picky, it's alcohol, it did it's job.  We both ordered the Tuna Tartare appetizer. It was fine. You can really taste the ponzu sauce in the dish. I thought it was a hefty portion of tuna and the taro root gave a nice crunch but there was something odd about the dish that I could not put my finger on... maybe too much citrus? For my entree, I had the salmon (ordered to medium rare) which arrived sitting on a bed of crushed potatoes and a thin pool of watercress/lemony sauce. I cannot speak to the potatoes because I did not try it but the salmon was overcooked and dryer than I preferred (cooked more to medium well). I'm not a huge fan of watercress but the sauce didn't have the expected bitter taste. My friend ordered the poached ""free range"" chicken. The chicken must have lived a cage-free life to meet Aureole's class level, love it. Her meat was accompanied by a side of wild rice and bokchoy. The chicken came pre-sliced, which I found a bit odd but I think it was for preso sake. She did not complain about the food but she is easy to please :)For dessert, we both ordered the coconut panna cotta. The pineapple and the sauce around the panna cotta had a can-y taste, like the Dole canned pineapples I grew up with... too familiar  o.OIt took a bit too much effort to get our checks at the end of the meal but our water glasses were never empty.

1.0,1/16/2013,"Ok! I haven't written a review on Yelp for quite a while and this is really SAD that I have to share this on Yelp!!! I had one of the most unpleasant experience at a restaurant last night! Me and my friend went to Aureole to try the restaurant week menu. We got sat down in a fancy dinning room once we got there. Our waiter asked if we wanted any wine, we said 'no', then we took a look of our menu. We didn't find the restaurant week menu and we started to wonder if we made a mistake or something, but me and my friend both read the restaurant week menu on Aureole's website last week. Our server was no where to be found for 15 minutes. Eventually, someone came by, probably a manager asked if we wanted some cocktails, then my friend asked about the restaurant week menu. This guy told her people who ordered from the restaurant week menu had to sit outside (a bigger dinner room) and someone came by and trying to take us to another table at the bigger dinning room. At that point, me and my friend was like 'Is this a joke?' We had to be treated like a second class citizen because we wanted to order from the restaurant week menu?! This is pathetic!!! Aren't we all supposed to be able to enjoy these fancy restaurants who participate in restaurant week for cheaper prices?! Isn't this the whole point of restaurant week, no?! Me and my friend went to have some really delicious BBQ after we walked out of Aureole. The food at this BBQ place was awesome and service was great + we spent a lot less than $38 per person! I ate at Gramercy Tavern once. Our server was very welcoming and nice! It was a complete opposite experience of what I got from Aureole. Can anyone tell me what's up with this cockiness among some of these most expensive restaurants in NYC???",3,1,0,Joyce L.,"Jackson Heights, NY",6,39,1
2.0,1/13/2013,"Arriving, 15 min before our reservation. We asked if a drink in the bar was possible, but the hostess sent us directly to our table. We ordered the chefs tasting menu, 7 courses with wine pairing which we were told was to be ""an exceptional seasonal menu"".After we got seated, we were not offered any aperitif, only sparkling water. Started with oyster and roasted mushroom bouillon, safran tapioca, gold leaf, sea weed and radish. Still without any drinks. The oyster didn't taste fresh, and I didn't understand the taste combination. The party next to us were introduced the exact same amuse bouche by the same waiter as a mushroom dashi broth. Then we got the first dish, hamachi flown in from Japan yesterday, served with pickled crosne and champagne. This one had the potential to be very good, if they held back on the acids and the dominating lime zest. We already had been offered bread 5 times by now. The bread was OK, good selection of different types. It could be even better if it had been warm, and served with temperated butter.The second wine was fantastic, made of 100% burgundy grenache '79, but it didn't match the foie gras at all. Underseasoned foie gras, with too sweet garnish. Almonds, brioche, vanilla and pears. Panfried veal sweetbreads, chestnut purée, black trumpet mushrooms and iberico ham. The combined wine was a trimbach Riesling from Alsace. It was a nice pairing, but the wine was freezing cold and the food needed more seasoning. Golden tidle fish, black garlic purée and macadamian nuts. Fish was undercooked. The black garlic was good.Half a lobster, butter poached. Cauliflower purée and crosne (again) with a burgundy Montrachet. Best dish so far, but maybe a bit too much lobster on a 7 courses menu.Dry aged round of rib eye. Kale pureé, braised brisket of veal, brussels sprouts and beets. Spanish red blend. A great dish if it had been more distinct flavours. The party next to us had the string remaining on their meat. IS THIS A JOKE?Pre dessert. Pear sorbet and poached pears. Fresh and clean flavours. Ended with a toffee and chocolate dessert, which seemed a bit too french inspired and too heavy. There are a few positive highlights, but sadly it's not good enough. In total, this restaurant doesn't deserve one michelin star at all! So many terrible mistakes. The waiter forgot to take the cap off while poring one of our wines. Two times we were served the food before the wine. Too cold white wines, DIRTY plates and cutlery. My friend went to the bathroom and we were served the main course before he got back. During the whole meal the AC system was not running properly, it was either too cold or too hot. And it felt like a tornado were approaching while it was on. The waiters seemed stressed and running around like crazy, even though the room was only half full. I will not recommend Aureole. Perhaps we came here with too high expectations.",2,0,0,Simon I.,"Glover Park, Washington, DC",8,14,2

Cod and cauliflower blended together and shaped into a circular pancake.Second course: Stout braised beef brisket. I don't know what to say but WOW.

5.0,12/23/2012,"This was a singular dining experience. If I could give six stars, I would. I had exactly the New York dining experience I hoped for.From the moment the hostess answered my phone inquiry whether I could dine there (as a single) tonight, I knew I was in great hands. I arrived a number of minutes later, jostled and agitated from the unbelievable Times Square crowds. My server recommended that I enjoy my single malt for a few minutes before he turned in my prix fixe ticket, and I agreed.My first delight: a lovely amuse bouche of horseradish creme fraiche, domestic caviar, and, I believe, diced beets (I'm already forgetting some of the details).My first course was the agnolotti, a heavenly mix of three perfect cubes of short rib plus butternut squash ravioli in brown butter, a single halved hazelnut, matsutake mushrooms, and a smear of quince paste. Never would I have imagined that the unctuousness of the short rib would perfectly set off the equally unctuous ravioli. At first I thought the bittersweet quince paste was a mistake, but I came to love the distinction it brought to the plate,which was a marvel to behold. They should serve the short rib cubes in a bowl, I think. With nothing else. Meat perfection.Since I had decided to order the lobster, I ordered two glasses of the domestic Palmer cuvee sparkling wine. If I had been blindfolded I'm not sure I would have been able to determine that it was not true French champagne, so yeasty it was, with a delicate mousse. (Another service point: the server noticed that the first glass appeared flat--it was--and immediately had the glass removed, a fresh bottle opened, and poured perfectly.)The lobster was exquisite, especially the claws, served on a bed of diced sauteed cardoons, another single halved nut (macadamia this time) and the cauliflower puree a delight. Two skinned grapes added an unusual and wicked touch to the delicious dish (""Beulah, peel me a grape,"" I thought).I then received a palate cleanser, a brunoise of cranberries with a lemon (I think) sorbet. Perfect.Dessert was ""sugar pumpkin"" mousse, served with gingerbread and various diced fruits. Unexpectedly, the menu meant a spun-""sugar"" pumpkin, which contained under its shell the mousse. I cracked the pumpkin with my spoon and devoured the delightfully sinful creamy concoction, which I enjoyed with a glass of Sauternes.And another thing: I sat near a couple where one diner was dairy intolerant. I overheard my server treat her with great respect as he identified precisely what had been done to accommodate her own food (as well as warn her what not to eat on her significant other's plate).The service was WORLD CLASS. As a single diner, I'm occasionally treated like dirt or like cattle, but in this case I received outstanding service at every level, from coat check to water to wine service to my server himself. I made sure to tell the manager how delightful my evening had been, and he immediately notified his employees.This was a flawless dining experience, the food highlight of my week in New York. Dinner was $200, plus a deserved 25% tip. I would dine at Aureole again in a heartbeat.",0,0,0,Christopher L.,"Portland, OR",0,8,0
3.0,12/14/2012,"Some tourists flock to Times Square when visiting New York. Not me. I could see the bright lights of Broadway from my bar seat at Aureole (it's hard to avoid and I think I found one contributing source to global warming) and that was too close for me. Instead of buying trinkets resembling the Empire State Building, I try as many restaurants as possible on my trips. I had my first dinner at Lambs Club and then made the quick walk to have my second dinner at Aureole. I'd like to think that I ate better than trying Times Square feed lots like Guy Fieri's TGIF knock-off (or does TGIF mean ""Thank God It's Fieri's""? - Uh oh, another rhetorical question like in the NY Times review).Hours earlier, I had the foie gras at Lambs Club. Again, the California ban where I live had forced me to order foie. Instead of the terrine, I chose the whole, seared Hudson Valley foie gras. The thick piece of liver was gloppy and not smooth. The squeamish should not order this dish because the reddish juices that oozed from the inner pores of the liver might offend the sensitive. Aside from that, it was a conservative dish with the commonly used Marcona almonds, pear, and brioche. I normally love brioche, but it acquired other flavors from an unclean grill.The sea bass was the least exciting dish of the night with lackluster concept and execution. The bass was fishy along with being cooked first and then sloppily deskinned. A brunoise of other ingredients were included. The diced butternut was a misplaced seasonal ingredient. The diced zucchini was boring. The leeks were the one ingredient that worked. The bass also came with sea urchin - barely. There was one pinch of sea urchin or uni that didn't match the rest of the dish and was a ridiculously small portion. Maybe then the menu said uni, it meant both for urchin and one - as in uni uni. You can probably taste more urchin by licking my profile photo.It was temping to explore the wine list because the glass-enclosed wine cellar was taunting me (even though it is a small homage compared to the wine angels in Aureole's Las Vegas outlet). But I opted for the gimlet-like and simplistic ""A Word in Edgewise"" cocktail.I wanted to like Aureole more. Have you ever dated someone who was polite, well-mannered, and attractive, but just wasn't fun or clever? That's how I feel about Aureole. It's a fine restaurant that is desirable and perfect to meet the parents, but not something to love and adore.",1,0,0,Brian U.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,1798,109

5.0,12/6/2012,"I had an excellent meal in the main dining room on a recent weeknight.  I arrived early so I had a drink at the bar while I waited for my dinner partner.  The bar was packed with bankers types--the restaurant is, after all, in the BofA building.  I was surprised that there was only one bartender, which resulted in some long waits.  My dinner partner arrived late but the receptionist was gracious, as we had a drink at the bar and were way over our reservation time before we walked into the main dining room.  The room wasn't full when we walked in at 7 pm but it filled up later.The layout of the restaurant is such that the bar and bar restaurant are in the front of the room with views of the street.  It's a large space with tall ceilings and the noise level is high.  The dining room is in the back of the restaurant, and is an elegant regular-sized room with lower ceilings (and by the way has no windows).  I believe the bar and dining room have the same food, but in the bar you can order ala carte whereas the dining room serves only set menus in 3 or 5 (or more) courses.  As far as I could tell, it costs about $15 more for the same three courses in the dining room, but the ambiance in the dining room is quiet and elegant, whereas the bar area is more raucous.We had the 3 course menu and each course was delicious.  The portions are not huge but the goal is not to stuff the diner--it is to provide food that can be appreciated and savored, and that does not have to be done in massive quantities.  Anyway, I certainly did not leave hungry.  The service was efficient and ever present without being overbearing, and the sommelier was knowledgeable and gracious.  All in all it was a fabulous dining experience, worth the price, and I would go back for special occasions.  Expect to pay upwards of $500 for dinner for two with a bottle of wine, including tax and tip.",0,0,0,Dave L.,"New York, NY",32,361,10
5.0,12/4/2012,"I have been here before but just for a drink at the bar.When my friend suggested we have dinner at Aureole at first I was a bit reluctant but then I thought, let's check it out since I hadn't eaten there.After reading some recent review I was even more concerned but decided to give it the benefit of the $100 or so doubt.So we sat in the bar room and started to order - quite a nice menu selection and priced at a months worth of McDonalds! We ordered the Hamachi and the Carpaccio to start at a Tenderloin each.The Hamachi was excellent with the combination of pastes and small cubes of pineapple - so fresh! The carpaccio was equally good but a little on the salty side for my taste.For the wine, our waiter tried to sell me a $27 glass of wine saying it was the best, so I had a taste, it was just too light for me. The Pomerol is a fantastic option which I had. When the Tenderloin arrived I was a little surprised by the quantity but it had enough on the plate. The combination of flavors were just amazing! So it was medium on size and very big on flavor - a must do.Other than the theatrics of the high ceiling and exposed wine storage the food is very special and a must do.I was eager to see the bill to check if there was an automatic tip added like a previous review mentioned, there wasn't.

We get our table, I get up to go to the bathroom, come back... AND STILL NO WATER?! Come on! When we did ask our server for water, it was promptly brought to us. However, I couldn't even drink it after I asked the busser for bread and he smiled. Not only did he not understand me but his teeth were going every which way direction.

But I'm happy they were eating because our food took forever to come up.When it did come it was almost like the cooks didn't try at all. The presentation was terrible. Almost like the person bringing the food my table tripped, fell, dropped it, and reassembled it. At this point I didn't even want to eat it anymore.

This is the Bar room of course.  The formal dining room is quite secretive (you can do only pre fixe here, the Bar room has a la carte options), and given the high prices, I am not sure if I will have a chance to see what it looks like anytime soon. Bf and I came here for Restaurant Week to celebrate my new jobby. :D.  While their RW menu isn't super fancy or complex, I'd heard they don't skimp out on fresh ingredients and I agree. The menu is simple but executed well. A table for 2 was no trouble at 8pm on a Wed. Though we were squished in the restaurant was pretty crowded.  I think there were only 3-4 servers for the whole place so service lacked a bit. They were a tad slow with bread (had to ask for it), fine with refilling waters, but worse, slow with bringing out the food.  I guess it's fine to space out the meal as bf and I often chow down but it's not fun when your desert comes out with melted sorbet.I'll get to that. First the bread- which I asked for, then proceeded to ask for the refill. Yum! Nothing special about the purpleish sourdough (or was it whole wheat? *shrugs* it was cold), BUT the herbed, buttery foccacia was out of this world. No (hard ass frozen) butter needed!My course:  the tiger shrimp- ok this was nothing special.  Very good, simple, perfectly cooked shrimp. Good sauteed bok choy.. barely there kimchee in the consumme. I had asked if there was head on the shrimp, and our server said yes. she was wrong. Oh well (she was sweet, though, often checked up on us). I got four measley shrimps, too. Womp womp. The potato gnocchi- ok seriously yummy. And a good execution of gnocchi- instead of in a dream cream sauce, it was in a sweet corn sauce (with just oil I think, no cream).  Even better was the sauteed hen of the woods mushroom on top- so flavorful, and good. Love it. Very fresh.  The gnocchi themselves were good, soft and chewy. The apricot bread pudding for dessert with an *awesome* almond ice cream (sadly melty) and bits of apricot.  The bread pudding comes out more like a cake versus a pudding (not in a bowl) was was very eggy. More eggy than apricot. The raisins were there but thankfully, there weren't too many of them because I don't like raisins. Bf's course: the mushroom bolognese cavatelli. This cavatelli was like larvae looking and more noodle-y. Very good and al dente. I was most impressed with how the mushrooms (so flavorful, thank God for fungi!) imitated a meat bolognese.  With yummy parmesean on top. This was a healthy portion. The lemon pepper chicken with fingerling potatoes- good American home cooking.  I tasted a faint hint of lemon pepper in the chicken but it was cooked well with a nice crisp skin. Bf said the seasoning was KFC-like. Not sure if Charlie Palmer would appreciate that much. I did sort of agree in the after taste. Nonetheless, it was good chicken. There was a little of barely there sauteed spinach.  There were also fingerling potatoes- sooo good and sooo fried. Well nicely fried and well seasoned. Not drenched in oil. His desert was the hazelnut-praline chocolate cake, which was better on paper than in actuality. It was nice and crunchy on the bottom (like a Twix bar) but didn't taste Praline-y.  The hazelnut and dense chocolate were strong flavors though. The extra special twist was the very tart cranberry sorbet which cut through the sweet cake flavors like a knife. A+ for that. We didn't get an amuse bouce or petit fours, sad face but all in all, a good RW experience.

5.0,8/3/2012,"Most people who don't live here don't understand why New Yorkers are the way they are and even more so why Manhattanites are the way they are and one of the reasons is we have the best restaurants in the world and are so use to being spoiled, and one of those great places is Aureole. Charlie Palmer's flagship restaurant in the Bank of America Building, I didn't think it would be the same after moving from the townhouse on the upper eastside where it was for years and boy was I wrong. I've been to this spot a few times and loved it and last night was no exception and as one of my FAB FIVE I had a blast. For starters we ordered extra appetizers off the regular menu as well as the restaurant menu. To start the meat we had the Seared Hudson Valley Foie Gras, talk about melt in your mouth goodness, seared to perfection with hints of vanilla, apricot, and almonds served on brioche...OMG, makes me miss the days when I could eat like this every day. We followed with a Yellowtail Tuna Tartare OHH, tuna and watermelon? Who knew it was the perfect combo and I'm not a fan of raw fish but I could have had this as an entrée, a nice smoky, grilled flavor with mandarin and sugar snap peas...WOW. Then we each had the Cavatelli Pasta with Rock Shrimp, peas and chili flakes, the dish was nice and mild and a prefect starter, very light for a pasta dish. My friend had the Skate w/fregola, corn, tomato, and hints of basil, I can tell you I'm not a Skate fan but this I would order...Very well done and I must say the tomatoes were so fresh they tasted as if they were picked just hours before service. My other friend and I had the Grilled Pork Loin w/summer squash and a mustard jus, I've eaten a lot of pork loin over the last few weeks for restaurant week and I can tell you...IT WAS THE BEST I'VE HAD. I mean it was everything that pork loin should be and is not when you go most places. It was well flavored, the right amount of spice with the whole grain mustard jus, moist and juicy...you go boy! And for dessert we all had the Vanilla Panna Cotta w/berries, a lace tuile and strawberry consommé...talk about a nice light way to end a great meal (I could have used an extra cup of that consommé...DAMN). Now let's talk about the service, there are only a handful of restaurants that offer OUTSTANDING service and this is one of them, our server Sue was kick ass, the evening flowed so well and I rarely mention servers by name but she did an ""OUTSTANDING JOB"" so thanks for making our night out a perfect evening.

3.0,8/2/2012,"FYI: If I had the option I would give this place a 3.5/5. I came here for R/W.The experience was good, but not amazing. The rock shrimp was so good!! Buttery and salty, yummy. The skate entree was okay. I personally don't like the texture of this type of fish. It is similar to cat fish. The broth was delicious though. For dessert I got the cotta and that was amazing as well.All in all good appetizer and dessert, but the entree was just ok.We came here on Tuesday at around 6:30pm. This place was bustling already. It was sooo loud. I didn't like that. I had to drink a lot of water throughout the meal because there was so much taste & sodium in the food. Even after I left the restaurant, I felt dehydrated. The service was good, but not impeccable. The waiter came by and asked if we wanted wine and we said no. I think I saw a ""rolling eye."" And my water wasn't filled immediately.

4.0,7/23/2012,"Restaurant week delivers again. I love Aureole because it does not scrimp on RW offerings.  As for appetizers... deceptively simple al dente cavatelli in a buttery sauce was generously studded with rock shrimp that popped with freshness during each bite.  The shrimp were amazing specimens.  I mean like right out of the fishing net fresh.  The other option-- a twist on gazpacho was just spicy enough and just light enough to offer the perfect complement to a glass of reasonably priced Rose' from Provence-- a wonderful way to start a summer dinner.  The gazpacho had a thin broth but featured some slivers of avocado.  I loved it.The pork entree' with squash was good, not great.  The vegetables were the best part but the pork was nicely cooked.  The sauteed skate entree was just the opposite-- the fish was masterfully cooked to perfection (brown and crispy on the top and moist and flaky throughout) but the accoutrements were a bit off (I didn't understand the raw cherry tomatoes).  Neither disappointed but I won't be going back for either anytime soon. The hazelnut dessert had a crispy bottom layer that I loved. It was quite dense but I enjoyed it, especially when I doused it in the sour cherry sorbet.  The decaf cappuccino flopped and should be skipped.  Go for plain old instead.  As cheesy as the location is, I've been here a couple times now and it actually is kind of fun.  I never spend any time in this neck of the woods but Aureole provides a nice perch from which to observe the touristy mecca madness!",1,0,0,Jason N.,"New York, NY",307,671,1117

Service: Friendly but a bit slow.Atmosphere: Intimate, lovely.Food: Delicious. (Their summer restaurant week menu is posted on their website.)#1 Cavatelli Pasta - My favorite. Perfectly al dente and flavored. Not too salty, but plenty flavorful. Shrimp was perfectly cooked. Definitely some of the best shrimp I've had. #2 Pork Loin - Cooked perfectly. Tender and moist. Vegetables were fresh and added a nice texture in contrast with the pork. Flavor was subtle, which was good because you tasted the pork more. #3 Hazelnut Chocolate Cake with Sour Cherry Sorbet - Rich and indulgent. Strong Hazelnut flavor that went well with the tart, refreshing cherry sorbet. However, I tasted my friend's Panna Cotta, and I liked that better. It was lighter and creamier for a dessert at the end of the meal. I had a great experience at Aureole, and they didn't seem to have skimped on their Restaurant Week menu.

4.0,6/19/2012,"I actually went by myself around 8 pm on a Sunday night.  As someone who does not (because I cannot afford to) typically eat at ""fancy, expensive"" restaurants like this, I very much enjoyed this experience.First course: Ruby Red ShrimpSecond course: Scottish SalmonDessert: Mint Ganache (no longer on the menu)Everything was presented very artistically and I appreciated the service I received.  The food was quite delicious as well.  The Mint Ganache had edible gold flakes on it which I've heard of, but have never actually eaten myself.  Granted I think the restaurant thought I was a reviewer since I was by myself on a Sunday night and kept looking at my phone underneath the table.  I even received some sort of free appetizer, however I don't know what it was because the server talked so quietly and quickly.Overall it was a pleasant experience and like I said for someone who doesn't normally go to more ""upscale"" restaurants, this was a nice treat for me.Be prepared for the bill however.  Good food comes with a hefty price tag.  For my three course meal (a la carte), one glass of wine, and sparkling water, it was $94 (not including tip).  I was perfectly okay with that though as I was on a business trip and my corporate credit card paid for it.  :)",1,0,1,Amy B.,"Milwaukee, WI",95,99,121
1.0,5/28/2012,"Totally overrated.  My wife and I had dinner there for my birthday and were expecting so much more.  The service was very slow, and food was completely unremarkable especially given the price.  We had the 5 course tasting menu and it was bland, poor in its pairings (not creative - there are flavors that don't belong together), and the starter - an amuse bouche - and finish - our dessert - were terrible.  The desert was a completely uninspired baked alaska.The ""New American"" style of cuisine is ubiquitous, so any place offering it up at this price needs to do a much better job.I did like the ambiance.  The initial room was less formal, and had a range of diners.  Certainly don't pick the less formal room for a romantic dinner or special occasion - it was packed with kids and tourists (nothing wrong with that, but lacking the ambiance).  The back formal dining room was clearly more upscale, and offered the tasting menu.  The decor there was nice, and it was quiet and romantic.All, in all, there are so many better restaurants in NYC, especially at the price level.  We would have been extremely disappointed at half the cost.  Will never go back.  Should have read some of the recent 1 and 2 star reviews before choosing to dine here.",1,0,0,R M.,"Baltimore, MD",171,83,4

There were clearly people in the middle of their meal, basically, they wanted to leave early.My second trip yesterday, they lost a business lunch reservation I made two weeks ago. So either the reservationist did not enter the reservation correctly or the hostess lost it in the computer.  I knew something would be incorrect when I walked up to the front desk and the hostess looked at me with panic in her eyes, before I even spoke.  Needless to say, we weren't about to wait 45 minutes for a table as the point of the lunch was business, not food.  But after two poor experiences, I think I will cut my losses.

1.0,5/7/2012,"I rate Aureole terrible not because it is terrible compare to the whole universe of restaurants but because it is terrible compare to other New York fine dining restaurants. Probably ""poor"" rating is more appropriate but since I expected much more, I rate my experience ""terrible"". Negatives1. Disgusting location near Times Square. Some people here mentioned it is an oasis - yeah, it is oasis all right. The second you step out of Aureole you are surrounded by not so pleasant smells of street food and scary people.2. Dining room is sub-par - small, low ceilings, boring decor and it is always very very very cold.3. 5-course tasting dinner was way below our expectations. I have a strong feeling Aureole wants to save money serving 5-course (surely this applies to 7-course as well) tasting menus. First. The amount of food is half that of 3-course prix-fixe. Some people say the amount of food is not that important as people do not go to fine restaurants to pig out. Well, whatever, that is just bs. Portions are tiny. However, 3-course menu portions are well sized. If you decide to go to Aureole, order from $89 dollar menu and watch what tasting-menu-people get.Second. What is the deal with pineapple?!! 1/2 inch by 1/2 inch pineapple cubes are everywhere (we found them in three dishes). They look out of place. They taste out of place. They look cheap.Thirdly, strip steak was boring. Nicely cooked but boring.Four. PINEAPPLE BAKED ALASKA? Really? Tasting menu and Aureole gives you the cheesiest the cheapest desert item they have. That sucked for us. Well, lucky for us, my wife does not eat pineapples. After some commotion, maître d' offered her a chocolate desert instead of alaska - that desert was fantastic.Positives: maître d', chocolate desert, sea food items (bass with mustard greens was spectacular), no rush.",1,0,0,Alex O.,"New York, NY",1,47,3

3.0,3/4/2012,"Aureole is a solid 3.5 experience. The entire restaurant takes itself seriously, so I choose to review it with equal vigor. The service from start to finish is very good. Not telepathic like you'd find at similar level places such as Bouley and Gotham's, but good. I mostly enjoyed speaking a bit of Spanish with the waitstaff, which is always nice. There was never clarity as to who our server/ waitstaff was since the room is constantly served by a ""team"" of attendants. They were all very nice though and warm, not the typical cold efficiency found in most NYC upscale wait staffs. Now, the space this might be my biggest problem of the night. When you are paying these prices (which luckily my Girlfriends Father was paying hahahaha) the experience should be transformative. As I mentioned previously, I've experienced some upscale dining here and elsewhere, and in almost all of those establishments the physical spaces have been very special. Aureole feels like a sad tourist restaurant off of Times Sq. with a few bells and whistles. When you're inside you never feel as though you are away from the location of Midtown. Even the back dining room which is supposed to be the nicer part of the restaurant felt strangely city like with the brick wall walkway between 42nd and 43rd st clearly visible through the windows. And perhaps the most annoying and disappointing thing of the whole experience- the awful elevator music they play- I mean seriously? Are you going to play call waiting and elevator music at such a prestigious restaurant? When I dined at Gothams they had some nice light Jazz playing, at Bouley they played a mix of Vivaldi and Bach, Il Mulino plays Italian Opera. Maybe Bank of America offered a package deal when they moved into the space- they'd pipe their awful music from their call waiting straight into Aureole for no extra charge. It set my nerves on edge. Plus it was the first time I met my Girlfriend's Father so it all seemed some what weird/awkward. Now, the food was the shining part of the night especially dessert. Everything we had- Tuna Tartare, Beef Carpacio, Venison, Prime Steak, and Pheasant were all excellently prepared and presented. Nothing but good things there. The desserts were by far the standouts of the evening- Chocolate Gianduja and Caramel Banana Tart. Both were incredible. My sole complaint about our eating experience- the parsley beer list. They have an award winning wine list here, you'd think they could take 20 minutes to sit down and figure out how dismal their beer list is. When you are supposedly one of NYC's elite dining restaurants you don't offer Bud Light on the beer list especially when it's $6. That is not only an insult to people who love good beer, it's also an insult to the person who loves Bud Light, they know just as well that no one should charge $6 for a bud light. There were actually only a handful of European brews. Shame on Aureole for not offering more- Compare that to the deftly selected and sourced beer list of Eleven Madison Park. There is no comparison.             Some final thoughts on Aureole- It is not an elite NYC dining establishment as it claims. I believe I read that it has a Michelin star? If so then Michelin stars mean nothing to me anymore because they certainly don't deserve such an accolade. The food is excellent, but don't come too hungry because the portions are tiny (I left feeling slightly hungry).

No scrimping on the RW menu at Aureole! *cough, cough, Mesa Grill*.First off, the restaurant is beautiful inside: open and airy, with an upscale vibe that comes off as more inviting than intimidating. I expected us to be seated in the outer room near the bar (seeing as it was RW), but surprise, surprise, we got seated in the dining room inside! Awesome. We started off with some of the most fantastic bread I've had in awhile. I tried 2 kinds personally, the focaccia and the biscuit...which were both amazing and came to our table piping hot. For my 3 courses, I had the ruby red shrimp, the veal cheeks, and the chocolate ganache twist. Shrimp was good, but a little ginger-y for my taste (not a big fan of ginger). Veal cheeks, on the other hand, were AMAZING...melt in your mouth, bursting with flavor deliciousness. Chocolate ganache twist, while tasty enough and beautifully presented, had a strange rubbery texture that threw me off a little.

The seemingly chic ambiance of the Bar Room may have pushed this to a five, but for now I can't be sure. The quick summary: Cool scene in Times Square. Well-paced meal. Synchronized service (you'll see what I mean). Endless bread. Great food. Fair prices.The deep dive: Four options (least expensive to most expensive): Pre-Theater three course for under 60 a person (must be seated between 5p and 6p); Pre-Fixe three course for 89 a person; five course tasting for 118, and five course chef's tasting for 148.We opted for the Pre-Fixe, and it turned out to be just right for our appetite on this particular Saturday night. Things kicked off with four choices of bread: sourdough, baguette, focaccia, biscuit. The biscuit is baked with dill and is awesome; the focaccia was also great. Borscht was also served; if you like this Russian beet soup, then you'll have no objections to the small cup served up at Aureole.First course: went with the wagyu beef carpaccio and the yellow tuna tartare - both are great choices. The perfect bite of the beef carpaccio has a really nice acidity to it. The tuna tartare was pretty standard, and pretty standard tuna tartare is pretty delicious.Main course: was deciding between the venison loin and the cod - the server felt the cod would be better since I was having the beef carpaccio. Well let me tell you... the cod was fantastic. I don't think I've had this mild, white, popular fish prepared better anywhere else. Served atop a caramelized onion and fried, cubed (tiny cubes) sweet potato mixture. She had the pheasant, with is a lot like chicken but definitely tastes a little different. I can't articulate, but if you get it you'll not only experience the taste for yourself, but you'll also see the tube-like presentation. Weird, but good.A panicotta with blood orange cleansed our palettes, and then enjoyed a delectable gianduja chocolate dish and crispy crepes. Yes, gianduja chocolate (pronounced jee-an-doo-jia). I've never heard of this before - it's a fancy Italian word for nutella.

The service was incredible- although our table wasn't ready immediately we had drinks at the bar to start. I have to say I am happy we went over to the bar because the aureole signature cocktail was one of the most fabulous drinks I have had. It was flavored with passion fruit and lime citrus and was beautifully presented. The bread selection that was brought out to the table was also notable. As for the meal itself I tried both the farmed baby greens salad and the celeriac and parsnip soup. The salad was full of citrus and bold flavors. The soup which came with a smoked ham croquette was also delicious. I ordered the scottish salmon as my entree (mainly because this is featured on their regular menu as well) and was so impressed! It was coated in a ginger sesame broth served under a bed of bok choy and pomegranate seeds. The salmon was beautifully prepared and presented- the flavors worked so well together. Having ordered salmon at a few RW menus this one by far was the most superior. For dessert I had the chocolate ganache twist. I have to say the dessert was the least impressive on the RW menu- the flavors didn't work so well together but it was still decent.

Before showing us to our table, they offered us the chance to check our coats, which we did.Upon sitting down in a large and comfy corner table, our server came over and warmly greeted us, presenting us with food and drink menus. For our appetizers, we both had the Ruby Red Shrimp with Coconut Brother, Lemongrass, Asian Pear, Cilantro and Peanut. Overall, this dish was pretty tasty. The shrimp were warm and tender, while not rubbery at all. The overall mix of flavors worked quite well too.For our main course, I had the Braised Veal Cheeks with Potato Puree, Leeks and English Mustard Jus, which was decent. The braised meat tasted pretty good and was tender and juicy, but the potato puree was a bit watery. I can't remember specifics about the leeks.My gf had the Scottish Salmon with Bok Choy, Ginger Sesame Broth, Peanut and Bonito Oil. While the quality of the salmon was fine, whatever the salmon was crusted in, plus the broth, peanut and bonito oil really overpowered the taste of the fish.For dessert, I had the Citrus Genoise with Marinated Citrus, Orange Crunch and Grapefruit Sorbet. This was yummy, sweet and citrus-y. My gf just had regular ice cream, tho I can't remember which flavors.Overall, the food was good, but not exceptional. It was a meal that I'd expect to pay $35 per person for. I also felt that our server was probably handling a few more tables than she should've been.The food wasn't bad for what it was and some items, like the shrimp, came off their regular menu.

It's balanced well with the mix of leeks.Pearl Barley Risotto - This was also better than I'd expected; the use barley instead of Arborio rice gives the main a bouncy texture that worked in its benefit.DessertsCitrus Genoise - My favorite part of the meal. 2 scoops of grapefruit sorbet atop a soft spongy cake that's drenched with a tangy citrus juice, surrounded by slices of grapefruit and orange. The whole ensemble is topped with a thin caramelized wafer crisp. And surrounded by garnishing dollops of grapefruit syrup. The lightness negated some of the calories I scarfed down before it.Ganache Twist - The ganache is dark and soft, it's good but not much out of the ordinary.Overall, not a bad meal, but still expensive for what it's worth; it's a place you'd hit up for special occasions.

4.0,1/19/2012,"This review is for the Aureole bar room during winter restaurant week at dinner service. I had the shrimp appetizer followed by the braised veal cheeks and then the citrus genoise (sponge cake). For 35 dollars, everything was very tasty and well prepared. Our server was very efficient and knowledgeable. The flavors were pretty simple but this is also the bar room and restaurant week. My review is really for the execution of these dishes which was quite well. The shrimp were nice and tender. The lemongrass coconut broth accompanying the shrimp was bright and light; however my boyfriend received hardly any broth. The server poured most of it on my plate. The braised cheeks were very yummy, nice and tender. I especially liked the grain mustard sauce used and the creamy potato sauce. My boyfriend didn't care for the cabbage and leeks but i thought they were okay if not a bit creamy. Dessert was 2 small scoops of grapefruit ice cream on a layer of sponge cake with a caramel crisp on top. There were also 2 slices each of orange, blood orange, and grapefruit. One pet peeve: I hate when restaurants serve you cold bread and cold butter, Aureole did this. Cold bread I can handle...it's not like they are baking it all during service but why are they giving me ice cold butter impossible to spread?The only other thing i wish the restaurant would do is note that they are on the corner of Broadway and 42 rather than just stating it's in the BoA building. BoA is huge and the restaurant doesn't note that the bar is on ground level while the main dining room is at the top of BoA.",0,0,0,Lucy Z.,"Manhattan, NY",9,107,0

No not you, the other orange headed Yelp friend who remains anonymous but still likes to send me nice little compliments and feed me up the minute Yelp status updates. Might try taking up a hobby as your act is getting really old.Pretentious. One word I would have used to describe Aureole. But I didn't know you. I had never even set foot in your restaurant. It was not my choice to dine here. I lost in a landslide vote of 4-1. Ok, so lets take the 5th wheel out to a pretentious fine dining establishment near the park and really watch him squirm when we hand the sommelier a bottle of wine to decant and pay the corkage which it turns out that same bottle is offered on their wine list. This is a big NO NO in my book, but again not my call and my vote counted for zilch.How would Aureole react? With class and no mention that they offered the exact same Burgundy. He brought over six glasses (one for our Sommelier) and performed his magic turning it into a bottle of red swirly Heaven. The food presentation I must say is a little over the top. But in a good way in that each ingredient was placed next to or on top of another ingredient as to blend the flavors to perfection. I wanted the cod but no cod was available. Today's catch was not up to the Chef's standards. This is a good sign. But they did have duck from Long Island. Why the ducks out on the Island are better than the ones in Jersey is beyond me, but they just are.Aureole is near Times Square which makes it a magnet for theatre goers. But given the caliber of restaurant and the time it takes to dine here. Do yourself a favor and make your reservation for after the show. Nothing worse than shoveling duck down your throat and rush out to catch the 1st act of Lion King.

5.0,1/10/2012,"Aureole is without a doubt one of the best special occasion places around. While it's former location was certainly more quaint and intimate, the ""new"" Aureole is a beautiful space and a refreshing change from the usual Times Square dining. From beginning to end, my evening at Aureole was extraordinary.I was entertaining guests from Spain and our experience was amazing. We felt extremely welcome from the moment we walked through the door. The Maitre D' was charming and attentive and seated us at a beautiful, spacious table in the middle of the ""bar room"" with wonderful views of the wine bridge, as well as the floor to ceiling windows that look onto 42nd Street. To start I had the hamachi was outstanding. It was a very fresh and the flavors were delicious. I also tried my friend's Wagyu Beef Carpaccio which was even better than my hamachi. It is undoubtedly the best I've ever had and I'm eager to return so I can have a whole portion for myself. For my main course, I was leaning towards the Cod, but asked my server's recommendation. They had nothing but good things to say about the cod, but said their personal favorite was the John Dory. I had never had John Dory before but two of my other guests were ordering the cod so I decided to try something different and new and boy, am I glad I did. The John Dory was pure dinner perfection - I don't know what else I can say. The sauce was to die for and left me soaking up any remains with bread. I consider my server a miracle worker, for if it hadn't been for him, I would have never tried it.  As a table of 7 we shared 4 or 5 desserts, all of which I remember to be delicious. One that really stood out had pineapple and ice cream, but one of the chocolate desserts was also amazing.The sommelier was very helpful and recommended a delicious California Cab perfectly within our budget. My Spanish guests LOVED the wine and were very impressed.From start to finish, Aureole was a true treat. Service was exceptional, food was the best I've had in a very long time and the atmosphere was upscale and elegant, yet inviting and warm. I'm eager to return to check out the cocktails at the bar (and that beef carpaccio again) or for a more fine-dining experience in the back room - as soon as I find a date to treat me.

We had a party of seven that all were in from LA, and I tuned out to be the unlucky one.. You see I ONLY eat fish or some seafood, has been that way for roughly 15 years, so when I pointed out to the waitress that I have only two choices on the menu (which was fine with me), she QUICKLY corrected me and pointed me to a CHATHAM COD that SHE recommended... Great, we're all good... Well after receiving my meal I noticed that the bed of paella rice that was under my fish had CHORIZO in it that I tasted immediately... I summoned my waitress and asked her about this and her EXACT words were... ""Well it says it right there on the menu""... WOW!!! ...okay.... Even IF it did, I think she could've forewarned me about this! She made me feel like it was MY fault for this mishap.. (You NEVER... EVER make a patron of your establishment feel like he/she is at fault ESPECIALLY if they're dropping upwards of $500+ on a dinner..Anyway, this waitress RUSHED me another BLAND and OVERDONE, SMALL piece of fish while my ENTIRE party sat around and waited for me to eat while they tried to act like it wasn't akward...

3.0,12/31/2011,"I've been going to Aureole for over a decade. While I much preferred their previous townhouse location, the dining room here is quite nice as well.  I dropped off a vintage bottle of Chateau Margaux hours beforehand for decanting, and the staff was very accommodating.  The food has always been merely good (and I use merely intentionally here), although this time around a person in my party wasn't happy with his meal. I can only comment on what I ate, and the warm fois gras was amazing (but I'm very partial to foie, so 'amazing' is more a function of the foie itself, not necessarily the preparation), but my pork entree was, again, merely good.  I was so full by the end that I didn't have room for anything but sorbet, but from my previous meals here, the desserts are always pretty decent.  I am regretting the fact that I didn't try the white truffle risotto special that another in my party ordered. It looked well worth the supplemental charge (it was ~$50 extra for the appetizer portion, and I believe ~$80 extra for an entree size over an $89 prix fixe, but the amount of truffle shaved was very generous).  I would not say the food is on par with some other 1-star Michelin restaurants in the city.  It certainly does not even approach some of the 2- and 3-star Michelin establishments (fairly obvious, otherwise Aureole would probably have been rated higher).  Given the quality difference, though, I think there is better value to be found elsewhere.  The three course prix fixe at Aureole is, as I said, $89, and, I believe, three course menus at some 3-star Michelin places like Daniel are in the $100-120 range.That said, would I go back?  Probably, but this is more a function of the fact that I used to live a few blocks away from their old location, so Aureole is more of a nostalgic excursion.  Some of the staff is still the same, even though the location has changed, which is a plus for me.  Overall, I think Aureole is definitely a place for a good, but not exceptional, meal with good service.  Don't hesitate to eat here if you can't get a reservation somewhere else...",0,0,0,Lester M.,"Durham, NC",10,54,15

Likely best for business dinners where everyone is looking for ways to linger over bottles of wine or for older couples who can appreciate an easy-to-cut filet . The spaghetti alla chitara, halibut, and beef tenderloin were all very well cooked and I think the sauce accompanying the beef tenderloin had a Sriracha taste to it??

Our waiter forgot my iced tea until halfway through my entree when I reminded him, and then he had to be flagged down for the dessert menu... and then to take our dessert order.  I normally don't mind too much for a nice lunch, but since I was in a rush to catch a train,  I did not appreciate the inattentive service.    Again, gorgeous restaurant with very pretty food.  But I would consider coming back here for RW only.  The regular lunch menu is just not competitively priced, especially since each entree is around $28-$30.  Even the chicken.  Appetizers hover close to $20 for minuscule portions.  Compared to JG's 2 plates for $29 lunch deal, it's just not justified.",0,0,0,Lu H.,"New York, NY",1218,411,1977
4.0,8/25/2011,"I was a little skeptical about this restaurant. I'm a big eater and usually stay away from the fancy, small plate type restaurant. I was amazed by Aureole. The food was outstanding and the service was even better. I was late for my reservation and had limited time before I had to catch a show at Radio City. They advised us to sit in the bar dining room. They brought the food out quickly and it was fresh and inventive. The staff gave us outstanding service without being to pushy.

4.0,8/21/2011,"I was in NYC for a couple of days, and I was bored/decided to go Michelin star chasing.  There weren't that many restaurants that had reservations available for when I wanted to have lunch, so I went with Aureole.The dining room was really nice--bright, airy, and hypoallergenic.  I think I'm allergic to NYC, but Aureole quickly put all my sniffles to rest.I got the corn veloute, the branzino, and the rhum baba.  These courses set me back... a lot.  I could have eaten for much less (34+ tax/tip) if I had gone with the prix-fixe menu, but the branzino (not on the prix-fixe) looked too tempting.  And it was delicious--the best fish I had had in a really, really long time.  It was perfectly seared so that the skin was crispy and the rest of the fish wasn't overdone, and paired perfectly with a beautiful purple mignonette sauce of some sort.  The other two courses were also very good, but not as memorable.The bread was excellent and plentiful, and there were several different kinds.  After dessert, they gave me a bunch of mini-madeleines, which I couldn't finish because I was too full.Bathroom:  A bit darker than I would have liked, but reasonably clean, and about par for the course for a 1* restaurant.Service:  Friendly, professional, and did nothing to offend me.",1,1,1,Frank F.,"Stanford, CA",4,30,0
5.0,8/20/2011,"If you are looking for a place that gets it right from the moment you walk in to the moment you step out of the restaurant - Aureole is it.Greeted by lovely happy hostesses - what a concept right? happy & nice?Promptly poured water upon sitting (they even covered one side with towel to avoid any potential splashes!!) Clearly I was raised by wolves if this is something you get all the time.But really, even if all this pre-dining stuff didn't happen and we're just talking about the food...well the food is AMAZING!I started off with their micro-greens salad....so delicate and perfect and fresh. They understand maintainging that balance of fresh and dressed. It was not over-dressed like some places, it had flavour but I can still taste the greens. The Burger is to die for. It comes about 5-6"" high, with a perfect bun, super super juicy perfectly cooked medium-rare meat patty and Hickory smoked bacon with aged cheddar. I can say this is the best burger i've had in a while. Their french fries are McD's fries dipped in crack I think. They were crispy but had seasoning & salty goodness. I dream of these fries raining down one day.Dessert - Eton Mess & Rasberry Creme BruleeEton Mess delivered on tasty multi-texture goodnessRasberry Creme Brulee made me see the light on incorporating Basil as a dessert.

5.0,8/18/2011,"Wow. Let me start by saying I worked for the pastry department over a year ago, so when my dad wanted to go to dinner in the city with me and my brother, I chose Aureole as I had been there but never eaten there. We walked in and were seated in the dining room right away, the bar room was packed. We were given water and menus right away, I was talking to Matt our server (although maybe he was a manager of some sort) and mentioned I had worked there a while ago and he said the chef I worked for was gone, but they have a new one etc etc. He was very nice considering I was just a lowly pastry person a long time ago.Any how we ordered and to start we were all given a red pepper granite with cucumber foam. Then I had the beef carpaccio to start, my brother and dad had the scallops to start. The beef was amazing, it came with a very nice cracker on top, the beef was soft as butter. The scallops were good (I'm not a scallop person) For dinner I had the lobster, my brother had the duck, and my dad had the strip steak. The duck was the winner for the night, the steak was really good as well. The lobster was delicious, but the duck was still better. Then we ordered dessert, and the few desserts we didn't order were all sent out as well. So we had 1 of every dessert on the menu. There was a strawberry with meringue and mousse that was the best and then the bah bah au rum was the second best. Everything was beautifully presented and tasted amazing. I would definitely come back .... if I could afford it.",3,1,3,ashley S.,"New York, NY",119,149,4
5.0,8/16/2011,"I attended Aureole for the first time this past week while I was home visiting family and my girlfriend. We chose this location based on it's proximity to the theater playing ""Wicked"" (awesome show) as well as its fantastic menu. This place did not disappoint. The setting is sophisticated yet casual and attire appeared to be casual as well. To give you an example of the robust menu, I had the duck sausage with potato puree. I have never seen duck as a sausage on a menu before and I love duck, thus I could not pass this up.There is a huge selection of wine and a full bar as well. The wait staff was professional and crisp. The food comes out at a nice pace to your table as well.

2.0,8/5/2011,"Aureole is beginning to jump the shark.  I have eaten here many times with clients for lunch. The last time was a week and a half ago.   They only had room in the bar room which would be fine except that they gave us a very odd table next to a column and we eat here around twice a month.  I also think that being a woman and paying the check here doesn't help.  It seems tables filled with men are always given the best seats.  And as ""skadden's lunchroom"" maybe they would be hip to powerful women?  Oh well.The bread is still fabulous. The food is pretty great BUT for an expensive restaurant the service is awful. We have not been able to keep their attention to get out in a timely manner. Maybe you do need to be a male and in a suit. One waiter who our client called Lurch was all about the stiff tableside timing.  He stood at a right angle and practically saluted while placing the meal in front of you. It was weird and he had a weird grimace.  He didn't seem to like people. When I asked nicely what herbal teas they serve he actually said ""well why don't we start with what you want?"" to which I nicely responded that would depend on what they offered. I ordered verbena, not something I would have guessed.  There were other exchanges like this but it was so weird that our client was shocked!  She though he was incredibly rude.The time before our waiter didn't know about one dish and went to ask, came back and the same thing happened with the next dish and so on.  It was ridiculous.  The kitchen does not deserve this lunch waitstaff, and neither do I.  I think I would rather head to db cafe or Le Bernadine or Oceana.",1,0,0,Anne A.,"Chappaqua, NY",4,31,0
5.0,7/21/2011,"I adore Aureole, having had several romantic dinners here over the course of the past year since it opened. I even hosted an extremely special event here for a party of 65 last fall. This place is decorated in a soft, sophisticated pallette of colors and textures, and the service is absolutely perfect - attentive, but not annoying. Nothing ruins fine dining like the experience of being hovered over by snobs (I'm looking at you, Del Posto) and Auerole delivers a stellar dining experience out of the park. You begin with a selection of soft, delicious breads, wafers & crackers with honestly, the best butter blend I have ever had. Be sure to start with a vegetable course, as all of their veggies are carefully sourced from area farms. The steak is my favorite entree (having dined here an upwards of 5 times), but the fish is always well-prepared. Consider yourself lucky if you can order something nesting incockle broth, and think of me when you're in heaven. Desserts are fabulous as well, as are drinks and the wine selection. Best of all, the restaurant offers a variety of dining/seating options with the restaurant - choose from the bar, bar room, and the dining room in the back.

The service is impeccable and surprisingly unpretentious for a place as upscale as this.The wine list is extenstive (we were being good and just had a glass each.. of the malbec and the Charlie Palmer sparkling.. both were lovely). Everything was seasoned perfectly.. the garden market salad was lightly salting.. it was surpring, in a good way. The breads were seriously both amazing - the roll and the chedder (hey, this is important). The Peekytoe crab sat on a bed of zuchinni flowers and the tagliatte had the perfect sharing with panchetta.Perfectly prepared food, beautiful evening!

3.0,7/12/2011,"I came to this restaurant for restaurant week while on my lunch.  Aureole is right next to Bank of America and their restaurant is segmented into several different dining areas.  Since I didn't have a reservation and they were completely booked for lunch, I was forced to eat at the bar, which of course isn't a big deal as long as I get to eat!  I ended up ordering the shrimp with melon salad, skirt steak, and a fig tart.  The shrimp smelled fishier than I am normally used to but more like the fresh ocean rather than rancid rotten shrimp.  They were seasoned well with salt and I'm assuming it was a siracha mayo was artistically dotted along side the shrimp.  The melon salad was interesting, it was a scoop of cantelope, watermelon, and honey dew with some micro greens on top.  It tasted like they had dipped each melon ball in vodka, not sure why but it certainly didn't add anything.The skirt steak was served with asparagus, and sliced fingerling potatoes.  The skirt steak was cooked perfectly medium rare but sliced (LAME), the asparagus was unseasoned but obviously cooked in the same pan as the steak to get that meaty flavor.  The potatoes were amazing as they must have been cooked in bacon grease.  Perfectly crispy, and oozing that porky goodness.The fig tart was essentially sliced fig across a puff pastry, a scoop of vanilla ice cream, and some curled sugar on top.  It looked pretty, but lacking in any real flavors that burst out.  The bartender was very friendly and service was ok, at the height of the lunch rush it did take a little longer than I would expect for a high end restaurant, so my lunch extended a little beyond an hour.  All and all, Aureole is a pretty good restaurant with well executed dishes.  But I will say at least based on the restaurant week menu, it's missing the ""wow"" that tasted amazing factor that I was hoping for.  This is definitely a good place for a business lunch however, serving up some good food given the other choices in midtown.",1,0,1,Phil L.,"Seattle, WA",167,876,249

4.0,6/24/2011,"Aureole was not my first choice for a pre Broadway show dinner, not even my second or third. I originally has a reservation at Gordon Ramsey's London but had to let that go since the timeslot available is too close to the show. Apparently, 2 weeks advanced reservation is not good enough for many of the famous fancy restaurants even on a weekday. Lesson learned.I was still slight bitter I had to 'settle' here. On the bright side, their pre frix menu price is really only 60% of what I had budgeted for my fancy dinner so more food later!It didn't take long until I started to like this restaurant. Service is expected to be great at restaurants at this price range. Aureole had done a little bit more than I have expected. Waitstaff was professional, courteous and non obstructive. They always works in pair to remove both empty plates promptly at the same time. The food did not disappoint. While nothing was really out of the world spectacular, everything from beginning to the end were strong. Excellent bread with quality olive oil for dipping. That alone was enough to make me happy. Appetizers : Foie Gras Torchon - The almond brioche is quite tasty. I wish the torchon is very buttery smooth but lacking the strong foie fras flavor.Hawaiian Hamachi - Not a bad dish but I have seen too many similar dish to be impressed. Hamachi and Uni. Really can't go wrong with this combo. The baby red shiso has a oddly addicting bitter flavor.Entrees : Long Island Duck - Duck breast with cherry sauce is a bit too typical. This dish lacks originality but the execution is still great.Maine Lobster - Love the crunchy texture of the lobster. The bone marrow is very addicting. Mix a bit of that with the orange fennel broth to eat with the lobster and it was heavenly.Desserts:Poached Pineapple in Muscat de Baumes-de-venise - Very interesting dessert. I love the cilantro and passion fruit combination. Light and very refreshing, perfect for hot summer days. Good use of contrasting elements and fairly innovative creation.Chocolate Souffle - Again I think I had too many good souffle to be easily impressed. Everything is already but noting really caught my attention. I like the little chocolate cake bites on the side more. were a pretty decent surprise. Dinner was about $200 for two without any wine and before tips. There are a cheaper pre threater menu for early diners too.

The bread was delicious.  Fresh and soft.Mixed green salad - a little too heavy on the dressing, but had some good ingredients such as thin shallot rings, small cubes of beets, mandarin oranges, and goat cheese. Steak was the perfect portion, and cooked to perfection.  Slightly crispy on the outside, and juicy and flavorful on the inside.  There was also an unnaturally green sauce over the steak, but the mushrooms, spinach, and mini cauliflower were delicious. The dessert was bread pudding.  I'm not a huge fan of bread pudding, and it seemed more like moist muffin (cooked a little more, and shaped like a muffin), rather than a soft, bready pudding.  All the same, it was pretty tasty.Definitely seemed like a business lunch/dinner atmosphere, and I definitely enjoyed myself!",0,0,0,Anjali M.,"Detroit, MI",93,149,11

4.0,1/12/2011,"Aureole is polished, glossy and elegant. It would be sexy if it were not so self aware, but sometimes one can ask for too much (and by one, I mean me). Service is top-notch. A winner for most fancy meals one might think of.I went for lunch with a friend late last summer. The place was very busy, we had no reservations, and so we sat outside to avoid waiting (they have a semi-outdoor seating space with a few tables between the connecting area to the next building on the west side). I started with the gazpacho: very refreshing, good variation of light flavours- a little garlicky, different kinds of peppers, smooth dollop of guac sitting in the middle sprinkled with chunky sea salt. Simple, but done right. A few minutes into our apps, it started raining fiercely, and combined with the swirling winds caught up between the buildings, we were not wholly protected by the high ceiling. The host came out immediately and asked if we would like to go inside and wait about 5 minutes, as some space would open up soon in the bar room. We waited, in about 5 minutes we were called over, and we took seats facing the window and resumed our meal. I thought they dealt with the situation quite well. Also, watching midtowners scramble back to work through the near-stationary Times Square crowds, and suddenly vehement rain was fun. For my main course I had the seared skate wing, which was an absolutely gorgeous crisp golden brown, but light and tender inside. It was a perfectly balanced dish, a hint of heat from the sauce, salty spinach bed and baked lemon potatoes, contrasting with the sweet and tangy additions of the raisins and caper berries. A refined dish (albeit coming from a man who does not know what that word means), with great execution. I also got their box of chocolates to go, but my lunch partner stole that from me. So that leaves me with no choice, I shall just have to go back for dessert.",7,1,4,Zayed K.,"LONG ISLAND CITY, NY",56,76,245

Foie Gras Terrine: Very good, no surprizes.  Grilled Burger: Well executed but no better than a fancy burger joint.  Maybe the dining room is better, but I would skip this one in NYC.",0,0,0,Lauren J.,"San Jose, CA",118,44,1

4.0,12/8/2010,"So I read the reviews of this place and can not help but think, I need real people to go here. Don't get me wrong, not that we are not real people. But there kind of restaurants attract two kinds of people. Celebrations and 'someone else is paying'. The former has heightened senses (to the good and bad), the second is likely on a corporate outing, as such desensitized to the value of things. The former is either ecstatic about the beauty, the service, the desert or what have you, or rants about the very same things, if it is not what they expected given that they are paying dearly for their celebration. The latter is a connoisseur about expensive restaurants, suave with the wine list,  strict when judging tip for service. and if this compares well to something or other.I've been both, tonight I was the latter, the guy with the corporate amex. I always try to keep my emotions in check and feel fortunate enough that I get to go to great places and call it business.Working in the area I've walked by many times, especially around 7pm watching people enjoying a martini at the bar thinking about the days pre-children, wishing I was that guy holding a martini and having a good time, before returning home. So last night I proposed going there, after a night at Dave and Busters where I gate crashed someone else's xmas party. So the least I can do is take a few people out to a nice place (whilst holding a D&B teddy!).What can I say, the food was good, great, the portions were small, piled up high in the middle of the plate as you'd expect. Memorable? No. Competent? Yes. Either due to the the multiple makers marks before dinner or the lack of interesting items on the menu I can not even tell you what I had. And that we only yesterday. Oh yes, the fois gras and the black cod. Again, very nice, but not enough to become a regular.

3.0,11/26/2010,"""Fancy, sh-mancy."" This restaurant was heavy on the wallet but light on the stomach.The 3-course meal portions were rather small for its hefty price. Dinner for 2 with 2 glasses of wine (pignot and red wine) + tip was around $180ish? My date had salmon, some other odd appetizer, and some coconut dessert while I had steak, shrimp dipped in some odd cheese sauce, and double chocolate mousse cake with raspberry sorbet. Don't get me wrong, the food was good, but I wouldn't say I'd go crazy and come running back for seconds. If anything, it makes me want to run to McD's to grab a Big Mac to fill me up. The atmosphere was beautiful and dimly lit but enough to see your date, the waiter/waitress, those around you, and the decor. Stunning decor, btw! And the service...my goodness, Grade A service! I give this restaurant 3 stars, 2 for the food and 1 for the spectacular service we received. The waiters were all cladded in suits and their watches were of superior caliber...Bulova or Movado, anyone? If I didn't know any better, I'd think they were regular IB'ers...Again, this place is expensive, but I think it's primarily because of the service, the decor, and the overall over-hypeness. Personally, I wouldn't return here. Food was all right but nothing memorable or savoring to remember.

4.0,10/3/2010,"""Bubbles After Broadway"" sounds like a Woody Allen movie gone terribly wrong, but it's a cheap treat if you want to grab a high-quality bite post-show. The M-Sat (10-11:30 only) menu is a $35 prix fixe that includes entree, dessert, and a glass of (actually quite good) Champagne.I've heard complaints that Aureole's portions are small, but that will work in your favor if you, like me, don't want a huge meal to round out your evening. Having said that, we were both full on our way home and had no complaints about portion size.You won't miss the appetizer course because you start out with some lovely mini-ciabatta-type rolls to keep your Champagne company. My duck breast was perfectly cooked and sauced. It had a peppery kick that complemented the thin-sliced squash and pasta bits that lurked underneath. My husband's flatiron steak was delicious (well, at least what I could steal was), also a bit peppery and surprisingly tender. The weird thing is that both dishes were cool when they reached the table. If one of them was, that might be understandable. But both? Perhaps the kitchen has a communication problem.Dessert was sticky toffee pudding for me: a little gooey, a little gingery, and gilded with whipped cream and the most adorable, sweet  strawberries. My husband tried the banana split, which features sweet-and-salty cashews and cherries that throw the whole thing over the top. It's not big, but it sure makes an impression. I thought the bonus churros, with a little cup of bittersweet chocolate sauce, were unnecessary, but as soon as I tasted them I realized I was wrong. Anything this good is, in fact, very necessary.Service was excellent. Everyone we came into contact with was professional, low-key, and pleasant. Clientele skewed older, maybe half tourist/half local. It was loud, but in a cheerful way.I had heard that the interior is boring, which I guess is true but beside the point.

4.0,8/9/2010,"I walk by Aureole every weekday.  On a hot August day, it looks like paradise: diners enjoying their meals, laughing and smiling and chatting, sipping their wonderful drinks and eating their wonderful food.  Meanwhile, the plebeians (me) are on the outside.  So, I decided that this time, I would be on the greener side of the hill and have dinner at Aureole. We were seated in the dining room, an intimate affair that was recessed from the view of pedestrians on 42nd St.  I would have preferred staying in the bar area, with the miserably overheated plebeians in my field of vision.  Bouquets were everywhere - carnations, lilies, etc.  The lighting was muted.  Everyone in the dining room was older by a generation or two.  The music was a queasy selection of Kenny G. easy-listening jazz.  It was like waiting on the phone.  The interior did not feel terribly trendy - if anything, it reminded me of an extremely classy waiting area in Nordstrom.I ordered the frog legs, which was plated exquisitely.  Two quail eggs, served over easy, with filigrees of foamy asparagus, and spears too. Then, pools of a vinaigrette-like sauce that contrasted nicely against the salty blandness of the egg and sweeter asparagus.  The frog leg basically tasted like chicken but had a fishy flavor to it.  Also, bits of bacon that tasted like hong shao pork.  The dish was arranged with bits of gold foil.  It would have been precious sans.For the entree, I ordered the lamb loin, with purpled potatoes, brussel sprouts, asparagus, and dollops of figs on the side.  Also, peas with almond bits were sprinkled next to the asparagus.  The crunchiness of the peas / almonds worked well with the lamb / potatoes.  The lamb was hearty and filling - not overly seasoned, just a solid dish.  My brother ordered the medium rare salmon (with roe) served over an emerald puree of something like spinach and topped with a crispy rice-bread.  One bite of that was more memorable than my entree.  I finished with the chocolate soufflé with Earl Grey cream and slices of sugared tangerine.  Although the lamb was already a belt buster, I enjoyed the soufflé because it was rich and sumptuous, an exclamation point after the straightforward entree.  There were also complementary churros, which my eyes lingered on but hands left for the waiters to take away. Wine: started with a half bottle of white burgundy.  Sweet and enjoyable.  Then a syrah, which was also enjoyable.  I don't know much about wine, but I can say that the sommelier came by, as exuberant as his haircut, and thoroughly considered our choices, remarking how this little region was underappreciated and that little vineyard was named for a telegraph wire.  Surely he did not lead us astray.Generally speaking, the service was excellent.  There seemed to be more waiters than diners.  I could not discern any differential treatment between our table and others, despite the age difference. I debated whether to look at the bill afterward.  I knew that seeing the number would not better my dining experience but a sadomasochistic need to know the truth drove me on.  The number was not pleasant, indigestibly so, but what can one expect?  Eating here is expensive (unless it's restaurant week or you order one of the more limited prix fixes).  It is also very, very good.",2,1,0,Eric W.,"New York, NY",17,89,0
1.0,8/7/2010,"I usually stay away from restaurants in tourist areas... well, because I'm not a fan of overly crowded places. Anyhoo, a friend of mine had to return something to the BCBG near Aureole and it was the midway point between my house on the UWS and her job in Chelsea.I don't mind paying money for anything, so long as it's quality. We were going out later and didn't want to eat too much, so we just skipped right to the main course. We ordered the cod and the  sea bass with a bottle of riesling.  Well, thank god for the riesling  and the starter bread. If we hadn't been so tipsy from the wine, we probably would have been a lot more upset.We were expecting small but delicious portions and what we got was tiny and mediocre at best for $45 per entree. Good fish should melt in your mouth. Needless to say, this fish did not. In fact, my bass was a bit rubbery. Again, thank god for the reisling and bread. If the food quality isn't there, they could at least overcompensate by giving you more of it. Our fish was literally 2 cubic inches. For the $150 we spent on dinner at Aureole (if we weren't specifically trying to eat lightly), we would have been starving and gone out for pizza afterward. For the same price, we could have gone to Buddakan and had the most mouthwatering and delicious food ... Appetizer, main course, dessert and drinks. Aureole... not worth it.

5.0,7/31/2010,"I went here for Summer Restaurant Week 2010 and was absolutely blown away. To begin, the atmosphere was relaxing and elegant. It was very ethereal, indeed. The staff was impeccable and kept everything flowing, from wine to water. I ordered a glass of prosecco with my appetizer and my waiter made sure to fill my glass to the very tip-top, which I appreciated; I've been to places where I've paid $10 or $12 for a glass and get much less than I expected, but not here. I ordered the shrimp first, which was so fresh and bursting with clean, crisp flavors. For the main course, I got the chicken breast with onions and mushrooms, which was served with a beautiful sauce. The chicken was cooked perfectly and the skin on top was crispy and wonderfully golden. For dessert, I had the rocky road, which was deconstructed and a real joy to eat. My dining companions ordered the shrimp as well, and seemed to love it just as much as me, but then one friend got the cod, which was buttery and amazingly delicious, and the other got the steak, which was cooked exactly how she ordered it and was honestly one of the best pieces of red meat I've ever tasted (we all had to have a bite of one another's food, of course).

4.0,7/21/2010,"Some coworkers and I decided to take advantage of restaurant week and went to Aureole for lunch yesterday. Aureole is a very sleek-looking restaurant; it manages to maintain an air of dignity and classiness without feeling cloying or ostentatious. The service also lived up to the standard set by the decor; it was fast and attentive without being overbearing or smarmy. The food, however, was uneven when compared to the other aspects of the restaurant. For restaurant week Aureole offered a three-course prix fixe lunch for $24. There were three options for each course on the menu, a pretty good deal. To start I had the pan roasted shrimp with summer melons, prosciutto and arugula. This was an interesting dish in that it was a combination of sauteed shrimp with prosciutto and melon. The shrimp was absolutely delicious, sauteed in olive oil with a little garlic, it needed nothing else to make it perfect. The prosciutto and melon were also quite good, although the melon was finely diced into little cubes. I understand the aesthetic appeal of that presentation and I realize this is a somewhat silly complaint, but I wish the pieces of melon had been larger; a size at which you can reliably spear them on your fork rather than watch them tumble back down onto the plate and at which biting into the melon releases a burst of moisture inside your mouth, one that you cannot get when the fruit is no larger than a quarter-inch on each side. What really threw me off about the dish was when I tried eating the shrimp and prosciutto and melon at the same time. Both were delicious and well prepared, but the flavors did not come together; it tasted as if I were eating two entirely different dishes that did not complement each other.For my main course I ordered the marinated flatiron steak, which was served with baby bok choy, rice with coconut flakes, scallions and a chile garlic dressing. This dish was nothing short of flawless and deserves immediate entry into a food hall of fame. The steak, cut into pieces with the dressing served on top, was cooked perfectly, and sublime on its own. Moreover, it matched perfectly with the bok choy, which was a hint bitter, and the rice with coconut, which was a hint sweet. I cannot imagine this dish turning out any better.I finished off the meal with the rocky road vacherin, which consisted of pieces of a rich chocolate mousse cake, chocolate ice cream and chocolate meringue cookies, with a reduced black cherry glaze and toasted almond slivers on the side, or, as the waitress put it, a deconstructed rocky road. Although all the individual parts of this dessert were expertly prepared, no two items on the plate matched well with each other. The combination of both the flavors and the textures was off and as a result the dish lacked cohesion and fell flat. My coworkers had the carrot cake with cream cheese mousse and pickled grapes. The carrot cake was among the best I have ever had, but the mousse lacked a distinctive flavor and texture and tasted like a filler, but of what sort I am still unsure. The dotting of the plate with balsamic vinegar also added nothing to the dish and only served to distract the focus away from the cake.There is a lot that can be said about molecular gastronomy. It is an interesting concept and, if executed properly, can be truly mind-blowing. A regular steak? Everyone has had one and knows what to expect. A steak served like the one described above? It sounds good on the menu, but you do not know how it is going to turn out until you taste it, and when you do and everything fits together like the pieces of a puzzle whose image you are uncertain of until it is completed, you need to pause for a minute to realize what you are experiencing, and once you have your mouth sings in delight because this unexpected combination of flavors is new, exciting and, most importantly, completely delicious. In theory since molecular gastronomic dishes have so many different parts, you could try thousands of unique dishes that provide delightful new flavors and experiences. The problem that molecular gastronomy faces is getting it right. The addition of each item to a dish increases the margin for error. Whereas it is easier to construct a winning dish that has two different elements, it grows exponentially more difficult as more elements are added. Therefore it is unsurprising that most molecular gastronomic experiences, while interesting, are often a letdown. Aureole shows some flashes of genius, and the caliber and preparation of its food are top-notch, but if it chooses to pursue overly complex dishes it will need to do its homework to make sure the flavors come out just right. For $24 the restaurant week special was a great value worth four stars and the restaurant served the perfect amount of food - not too little, not too much - but if I had paid a more standard price of $50 and up for this meal I would have likely given Aureole three stars instead of four.",3,1,1,Mike K.,"Seattle, WA",89,147,91
5.0,7/21/2010,"The best lunch of my young life thus far.I walk by this restaurant every morning on my way to the office and I must say, I had very strong preconceptions about this place.  I am strictly a downtown girl, born and raised, and so I've always considered midtown (especially Times Square area) to be the official CW (Cultural Wasteland) of New York.  Thus, nothing good can possibly exist there.  And East Village native that I am, I figured Aureole was just another pretty watering hole for corporate tools.Imagine my reluctance when my mom insisted on going there for a power lunch today.  Imagine my surprise when the food started coming and I realized IT WAS THE BEST FOOD I'VE HAD ALL WEEK.We started with the heirloom tomato gazpacho and farmed baby greens salad.  The gazpacho was tangy and flavorful with fresh avocado in the middle.  Maybe it was the olive oil floating on top but there was an elusive flavor tucked in there that hits you after the initial tomato tanginess.  The greens in the salad were super crisp, they weren't drowning in dressing, and the mozzarella was the perfect complement.The garlic croutons deserve their own paragraph.  They were perfectly, perfectly crispy and so thoroughly garlic-y that I thought my mother had turned into a rainbow bearing a pot of gold at the exact moment I bit down.  I kid you not, I really hate croutons.  Hate 'em.  Not the croutons here though.  Can eat them all day.For entrees, we chose the chatham bay cod and seared chicken breast.  For such an uninspired name, the seared chicken breast was so very yummy.  It was tender and juicy, not dry at all.  The green olive jus was perfectly balanced and the vegetables were fresh.  The jus reminded me of a non-salty soy sauce, if that makes sense.  On top of all that, the portion size was just right.The highlight of the meal and inspiration for this review was definitely the chatham bay cod.  It was PERFECTLY COOKED (I know, I've thoroughly abused the word 'perfect' at this point) and the little neck clam broth was so amazing.  The fish was smooth and the clam broth was buttery but light.  The vegetables were crispy and prevented the whole dish from being too mushy texture-wise.The dessert was meh, but whatever, at that point I was so full and happy from the cod that I was still satisfied by the unmemorable chocolate on the plate.Great, discreet service.  Didn't hurt that my server looked like Nigel Barker.  Will be returning for dinner.",0,3,2,Erica S.,"New York, NY",6,34,0

If one appetizer or entree stood out among the rest, I would certainly highlight it, but each was incredibly unique, well balance, and more-than generously portioned.

The plates were delivered at the same time and bread was served every few minutes. For my complaints: The gazpacho was bad. I should say, thin tomato juice with chunks of avocado. It wasn't gazpacho.

5.0,7/15/2010,"I came here today for RW lunch. The restaurant itself is gorgeous, very simple modern design done in rich neutrals with pops of color from the flower arrangements placed on the tables and around the restaurant. The bar room in the front has high ceilings, perfect for displaying the large spiral chandelier. It also features one full wall of window facing 42nd St (the entrance side) and providing a lot of natural light for the bar room diners. We had reservations in the Aureole dining room, a smaller room enclosed in the back of the restaurant. Here the ceilings were not as tall and the color palette shifted to darker neutrals. The smaller space combined with the dimmer lighting, chocolate-colored leather and dark wood accents all contributed to making the dining room feel like a very intimate environment. I loved the decor on both sides and I thought they did a great job with differentiating the sections while still keeping the design of the entire restaurant cohesive through colors and materials. The bar room seems like the perfect place for a weekend lunch with the girls, while the dining room is perfect for a romantic date.Now, on to the food! For lunch I had...... Pan roasted shrimp (with summer melons, prosciutto, and baby arugula) - I was a little wary at first because I had a dish once with prosciutto and honeydew that I thought was imbalanced and overall didn't enjoy much. But this dish made me think that yes, melon and prosciutto do belong together. The sweetness of the tiny cubed melons + savory of the thinly sliced prosciutto + two delectable shrimp... OMG flavor explosion in my mouth. This was so good!... Chatham Bay cod (with baby leeks, summer corn, potatoes, and little neck clam broth) - sings, ""yum, yum, yum, yum, yum."" SO delicious. This dish balanced all the delicate natural flavors of each ingredient. The fish was perfectly soft and the clam broth seasoned the fish without overpowering it. The cubed potatoes and corn kernels added texturally to the dish while the clams were an extra treat.... Rocky road vacherin (with toasted almonds and black cherry) - This was basically a deconstructed rocky road with each part stacked on top of another. I didn't care much for it because it was too sweet for my tastes.I won't let the dessert get in the way of me bumping Aureole up to 5 stars since I'm not much of a dessert person anyway. Plus, I realize that by going with the RW menu, I limited myself to just a couple choices, so I don't blame Aureole for a dessert I probably wouldn't have ordered if I were ordering off their regular menu. Overall I think Aureole does a perfect balancing act of melding flavors and contrasting textures. I will definitely be back.",4,1,3,Amy S.,"Astoria, NY",272,308,2490
4.0,7/14/2010,"3.5 stars...I went to Aureole for lunch for this year's restaurant week $24 lunch deal (about $30 after tax and tip). For those of you unfamiliar with restaurant week, it happens usually twice a year where 200-300 restaurants in the city participate to get people to check out their restaurants at a discount. Some restaurants will participate just in the lunch deal and some will participate in the lunch ($24) and dinner ($35) deal. Almost none of the restaurants allow the special on a Saturday and only some are available on Sundays. The deal includes 3 courses (appetizer, entree, dessert) and does not include drinks, tax, or tip. Usually the restaurants involved normally have entrées around the price of the deal (so it's as if you're getting a free appetizer and dessert) while some more expensive restaurants that have large portions offer a smaller portion of their entrées (usually steakhouses do this) for the deal. I've done restaurant week a number of times but this was my first time going to a Michelin stared restaurant and quite honestly my first time going to a place considered ""fine dining"" (of course I've been to plenty of nice restaurants like Jack the Horse Tavern in Brooklyn Heights or fairly expensive steakhouses like Peter Lugars or Angelo and Maxies). I don't know if the portion sizes for restaurant week here were the norm but given the plates they were served on I would have to assume they were. I went into Aureole not being particularly hungry and I left not being particular full. The portions especially for the appetizer and dessert were so dainty they were amusing but this is the type of thing I believe is usually synonymous with ""fine dining"". For my meal I got the roasted shrimp appetizer which was prepared with summer melons and prosciutto. The 2 shrimp I received were cooked just right and tasted great with the two silvers of prosciutto and the tiny diced cubes of melon. For my entre I ordered the Cod. The piece of cod (about 3/4 the size of a deck of cards but 50% thicker) was the best piece of cod I've ever had and the light broth tasted fresh and was perfectly seasoned. The 3 mussels that it came with were however disappointingly and surprisingly rubbery. For dessert I had the carrot cake. I thought it would be nearly impossible to make carrot cake into something small and dainty but they figured out how to. They made the carrot cake in tiny molds (about 3"") that was shaped, oddly enough, as a sea shell. This was served on top of a cream cheese mouse and garnished with 2 grapes cut in half and placed ever so artisticly on the plate. With the exception of the mussels everything I had tasted wonderful. However I was just a little too out of place in a fine dining restaurant of this nature to have fully loved my time here as much as I hoped I would.   In terms of the actual restaurant I found the staff to be incredibly friendly and attentive and the wait for food was not long nor was it rushed in any way. I sat along a booth against the wall and found myself sitting uncomfortably too low relative to the table in front of me but it wasn't unbearable, given that I'm 5'11"" I would expect someone much smaller than me might need to request a chair instead. The decor of the place was minimalist and modern and I've seen better elsewhere but it was still a nice ambiance. If fine dining is your thing, Michelin stars is something that impresses you (as it probably should), but Per Se, Daniel, and Le Bernardin are out of your price range then Aureole would be a good alternative (especially if you're a tourist and want to eat by Times Square).",4,1,0,Matt E.,"Brooklyn, NY",785,2205,1856

Then he turned around and didn't even notice me and proceeded to take an order from the guy next to me. I was a little flabbergasted so I walked myself all the way to the other end of the crowded bar to the other bartender who was quick to notice me but even he wasn't all that nice. Am I supposed to order 10 drinks before dinner? In the dining area, the tables were nicely spaced apart and the lighting was just right. Normally the servers push the table in far enough so you can reach the dish and utensils, but my friend and I ended up pulling the table towards us because it was too far away. I'm not sure if this is standard practice, but we didn't even get our food menus (prob 20 min after we were seated) until after we ordered the drinks, which took a while since the waiter took his time in getting the orders and coming by several times. There's a seven-course option (choices up to chef), a five course option (6 or 7 items to choose from), and a three-course option (lots of items to choose from).A genius idea for a group of four - order 5 three-course meals (lots of menu options) and share everything instead of ordering 4 five-course tastings (much less in menu options).

In Times Square, this is an intimate respite from the tourist traffic and chaos. Everything off the 5-course pre-fixe menu was divine, as was the service we received. Well played, Aureole. The second time I came here for food was just this weekend. We opted for the bar room area and both of us ordered of the pre-theatre menu. It was perfection once again, without the price of the dining room (don't get me wrong, it still wasn't cheap). The other times I've come here have been for a glass of wine and a few snacks after a long day at the office - every time, its been flawless... if not a bit crowded from the BoA building after-work crowd.

4.0,4/13/2010,"This review is for Sunday Suppers at Aureole in the bar room.  You can find their menu for the foreseeable future on their website.  I don't know what round table of geniuses got this idea together, but Aureole (along with a variety of other shmancy restaurants) is doing a $49 3 course prix fixe with UNLIMITED WINE PAIRINGS in their bar room every Sunday evening.  Me and 4 of my friends went last Sunday and I've got to say, this was a phenomenal way to round out the weekend.The restaurant is of course beautiful - high ceilings, perfect lighting, spacious tables.  I personally prefer eating in the bar room - I'm not afraid of fancy food by any stretch but it's nice to relax and not feel like you're at a work dinner with some rando broker.  The menu last Sunday was a crisp, fresh salad with some crumbled goat cheese, braised short ribs with potato puree and veggies, and lemon meringue pie.  The food was very good - I would not say excellent.  This is not refined to the typical Charlie Palmer caliber but it's not supposed to be.  It's a lot of damn good food and damn good drink for $49.  It's satisfying and homey even if I didn't like the pie so much.  But I don't like meringue, so don't go by me here.  AND they brought us out little bonus churros with our dessert.  Mmmm fried extras!  Gimmegimme.Now.  Let's get down to seriousness.  My friends and I sat here undisturbed for FOUR HOURS and drank our faces off.  The wine flowed freely and our servers were friendly - and by friendly I mean they kept pouring me (and really me over anyone else for some reason) booze.  We finished dessert at 8:38.  We left the place at 11:00.  What a great way to spend time with your friends - stuffed, happy, undisturbed, and liquored up.  Honestly, best $65 (with tax and tip) I ever spent.  I'd highly recommend this.  Plus I love that you can check out the menus in advance.  It's a true steal!",4,0,0,Erica B.,"New York, NY",43,33,0
4.0,4/9/2010,"So what do you order when you are dining at a high-end establishment like Aureole? Why a burger of course. Well at least during lunch time. With the sun shining and the women of midtown strutting there stuff, nothing like a nice window view from the bar and a good buddy keeping you company.  That would sum up my afternoon at Aureole.Located somewhere in between Bryant Park and Times Square, Aureole is a higher-end business attire restaurant. The entire first level is viewable form the street via the large glass windows. The interior is elegant and spacious. You know this place means business and you are going to be paying for a quality experience in the heart of New York City.Sitting at the bar a full view of the oncoming Times Square area, I was looking forward to seeing what this place could do to a burger. Especially a $20 burger. At the bar I was greeted by a very pretty bartender who setup us up with our menus. I decided to do the Eight Songs Shiraz which I thought would be a nice match for my burger. As we waited for our burgers to be delivered we chatted up about baseball, girls, wine, ladies, restaurants, babes, and well, chicks. Okay I'm exaggerating a bit...or am I?!?!Soon our burgers showed up and what a thrill it was. The burger was grilled to perfection, with apple wood smoked bacon, white cheddar, and pickled ramp dressing. I wrapped my hands around the burger and took a nice healthy bite (can I say healthy with straight face?) and the burgers juices just flowed down my mouth like a ripe pear. A sip of the shiraz proved my theory that the rich spice and plum flavors would kick ass with the burger. The side of French fries was fine but nothing to write home about.Eventually I was down to the last bite of my burger, the last fry and the last drop of wine. Every moment spent in my mouth was delicious and quite memorable. Me and my buddy were able to catch up and enjoy a wonderful lunch while people watching the norms and odds of the mid-town populous. The check came and I'll be very honest that while the meal and the company were great, the price tag is not for everyone. However if you've got the cash to spare and are looking for a nice place in mid-town to enjoy a very quality meal, you can't go wrong with Aureole.",2,2,2,Valentino D.,"Bronx, NY",4,23,4

4.0,3/13/2010,"Aureole is a first class restaurant based near the theater district. i would highly recommend this venue pre-theater. A special environment with a magnificent, yet modern dining room. Service is impeccable and very attentive to all needs, including water, bread and questions regarding wine and food.I started off with a very expensive bottle of a Merry Edwards Pinot from the Russian River Valley (California). I was impressed that Aureole had this caliber bottle on the wine list. I applaud restaurants who take a proactive approach to understanding wines.My meal was as follows:Appetizer:CHESTNUT TORTELLINI  PECORINO CHEESE, SAGE, POMEGRANATE SEEDS, BROWN BUTTER SAUCE - I was mildly impressed with this dish. It felt too sauced and thickened for me. The seeds did not encourage the unique taste of pomegranate and the cheese was a bit sloppy in appearance. The brown butter sauce was overwhelming.Main Course:BEEF TENDERLOIN HARICOT VERT, PARSNIP PURÉE, PEARL ONIONS, HORSERADISH BEEF JUS - I found this dish to be extremely solid. It wasn't ""gourmet"" or unique, but was perfectly presented, seasoned and cooked.Dessert:BITTERSWEET CHOCOLATE GANACHE TART  ESPRESSO CARAMEL, VANILLA CHANTILLY, HAZELNUT -  A high quality dessert served with decadent ganache. I applaud the pastry chef for this item. It was very well prepared. Sweet but well balanced with the vanilla chantilly.Side Thoughts/Suggestions:a) the breads were excellent. There were roughly 4-5 different types. I highly recommend you bring the bread professional back several times to encourage tasting. The butters were excellent and served at the right temperature.b) Many amuse bouche items. I was a bit surprised about how many actually came out. One prior to dinner and several dessert-like items. The bottom line is to balance your eating pace to consider these fancy extra items.c) sit in the main dining room. You will very much enjoy that experience.

5.0,2/15/2010,"The wife and I dined in Aureole's bar room during a recent trip to NYC. I have to admit that we initially chose Aureole in part due to its proximity to our lodgings at the Bryant Park Hotel, but that turned out to be a felicitous decision. I'll warn you right now that I'm going to gush a bit in this review, but that's only because we had such a wonderful experience.FOOD: Everything we ate at Aureole was delicious, and a consistent theme of ""bests"" emerged.We started by sharing the scallop ""sandwiches"" with foie gras. The scallops were seared to the perfect point of doneness, with just a hint of caramelization to complement their innate sweet ocean flavor. The accompanying pea shoots, passion fruit sauce, and chives made the entire thing pop with multi-dimensional yet harmonious flavors. The foie, while not an obvious pairing, really worked; I'm sure you could skip it and still be happy, but I found that it added another layer of luxuriousness and a baritone note that rounded out the dish. Now, I adore scallops, so I've eaten them many times, and I'm going to go out on a limb here and say that this was not only the best scallop small plate I've ever eaten, but one the top 10 best things I have ever eaten, period. I literally considered ordering a second serving as my dessert.We stuck with seafood for our entrees. My wife had the Scottish salmon, and not only was the fish possibly the best piece of salmon she's ever had, the accompaniment of cabbage, bacon, apple, and mustard gave the dish a heartiness that was perfect for a cold winter day. I had the miso black cod, which was among the best fish entrees I've ever had. The fish itself was meltingly tender, and the subtle salty/sweet/umami flavors of the miso gave it a depth that it might otherwise have lacked. The obviousness of the pairing with baby bok choy and shiitake mushrooms did not at all detract from its deliciousness. The chewy balls of forbidden rice provided a textural contrast that made the dish not only delicious, but interesting.We opted to share the dark chocolate torte for dessert, and it was silky, rich, moist, and chocolaty indeed. The scotch butterscotch added smoky sweetness, while the mild ricotta sorbet lightened things up a bit. Here I go again with the ""bests"", but this was easily among the top 5 best chocolate desserts I've ever eaten. Kudos to the pastry chef!DRINK: Aureole NY may not have the Wine Spectator Grand Award list of its Las Vegas sibling, but they really do have a nice selection, including a wide variety of by-the-glass options. I especially appreciated the fact that they had a sake (Chiyonosono) available by the glass, as it was the perfect match for the miso black cod. Although I was a bit skeptical of the private label ""ISC"" chardonnay, my wife had it with her salmon, and found it to be quite good, especially because it is in the crisper unoaked style. They also have interesting house cocktails and a nice selection of spirits. I started with some sort of apple-y thing that seemed winter-appropriate, and had a pour of Springbank to go with the scotch-based sauce on the chocolate torte.SERVICE: We found the service to be friendly, attentive, and unobtrusive. In other words, essentially perfect.ATMOSPHERE: We found Aureole to be pleasantly modern--not bleak and unwelcoming, yet not frilly. It seems to me that many restaurants do not pay enough attention to the comfort of the seating, but the chairs in the bar area at Aureole cradled us through our meal. Admittedly, there were some in the crowd who seemed under-dressed, undoubtedly a consequence of the proximity to Times Square. However, we were not at all troubled by the raucousness implied in some other reviews (perhaps dining at 8:30pm on a Friday helps?).THE VERDICT: This was one of the rare cases where there was no pondering, no wishing Yelp let me do 4.5, no worrying about ""grade inflation""... our experience was 5 stars all the way.",4,0,1,James K.,"Menlo Park, CA",46,117,11

The new location is very nice, less homey but more chic, and very close to my office. The service was very courteous and professional. We both had the striped bass ceviche, which was a generous portion (esp compared to Alto) although I would have liked a little less acid, and the popcorn seemed random and unnecessary. For mains, I thought my skate wing was very well made and I really liked the cauliflower also. The pork belly had a nice fatty layer and the bottom was a little dry. I remarked that it reminded me of roast pig from Chinatown (the crunchy crust kind) and after that we couldn't help but compare the two since the flavor and texture were similar. For dessert my friend really liked her ganache and I had the caramel corn sundae. I thought the sundae was good but nothing special.I'm rounding up to a 4 although I think it's not quite there. Overall for the RW price I thought it was a good meal although the pork belly was a little disappointing.

3.0,2/4/2010,"I hate, hate, hate to say it, but Aureole's noticeable weak link was in its service. For a celebrity-chef-helmed Michelin darling, that's a pretty embarrassing flaw - sort of like the chiseled and scintillating high finance hunk with vampire-slaying halitosis. Way, way too many servers zoomed noisily back and forth; still, incredibly, we were left tapping our fingers as we waited for orders to be taken, dishes to be cleared, and bill to be brought.That aside, the 5 course tasting was very, very well executed. The scallop sandwich was far and away the best thing I've eaten in 2010 - cradled in crisps, topped with seared foie gras, rouged with tangy passionfruit puree, and sprinkled with fresh, sliced sugar snap peas. The sturgeon, an eye-catching exercise in eggshell white potatoes mushrooms and grass green caviar creme fraishe and leeks was a slam-dunk. The venison loin and tuna tartare (Japonais-style, with miso sauce and nori) were solid, if not spectacular. The dessert, unfortunately, was a garble of heavy chocolate on heavier chocolate - the ricotta sorbet offering no cleansing relief. By the time we were presented with the house-made bonbons (mostly chocolate), I couldn't stomach another gram of sugar. So, I guess it nets out alright. A note on: the dining room, which seemed a somewhat awkward add-on to the ATM vestibule in the 42nd-street facade of the new BoFA building, was too hectically glassy - between the reflections of the patrons, the army of servers and the pedestrians outside, I felt as though I was eating in the middle of Times Square.",10,13,10,Liz C.,"Brooklyn, NY",643,600,3
5.0,2/4/2010,"Once in a blue moon, on rare occasions, the planets align, and a glorious happening occurs as the ingredients of all that is good fall into place. Even rarer is to ""garnish"" (pardon the pun) a restaurant five stars based on the lunch experience. Such is Michelin touted Aureole and its participation in Winter Restaurant Week 2010. Established on New York City's Upper East Side by prolific Chef/Restaurateur Charlie Palmer in 1988, Aureole moved to its pristine new location in the landmark Bank of America Tower across from Bryant Park in 2009. Long-time collaborator/designer Adam D. Tihany's (Per Se, Daniel, La Fonda Del Sol) shapes have become iconic; semi-cylindrical glass lighting fixtures and mezzanines unvariably paired with palettes of silver and gold tones throughout. His layouts are so well conceived and realized, resulting in the pinnacles of eye appeal and functionality. Rich textures of wood and cloths embody each area - the casual Café Bar, the Fine Dining rooms and Private party rooms, creating and continuing the intimate ambiance Aureole is known for in tangent with Tihany's upscale finishes of his famous glass enclosed wine vaults and Palmer's eclectic and vast wine program anchored alongside his renowned progressive New American cooking. Executive Chef Christopher Lee (Gilt) has been running the kitchen with surgeon like precision since the move and has his team in Bocuse D'Or form. With no waiting, my ""foodie"" confederate Donnell and I were promptly seated in the rear of the main dining room giving us a regal view of the entire restaurant. The place was a buzz with excited diners just restless with anticipation and expectations. The swooning commenced to samples of tangy Wild Striped Bass Ceviche and savory Potato Leek Ravioli that were cooked exquisitely and melted joyously on the palate. Our table host Mark was courteous and professional and was there for our every need. Service is like a ballet, graceful and on point in every aspect of detail. The sommelier team chose an outstanding 2007 Donhoff Estate Riesling served in dazzling Alsatian stemware. Our entrees continued the chorus of cheers. The Spotted Skate Wing with Caramelized Cauliflower, Golden Raisins, Almonds and Caper Curry Brown Butter was one of the best prepared examples my friend Donnell has had since Wild Edibles. I remember Charlie Palmer was known for his pork magic. So, naturally I had to order the Braised Pork Belly with Quince, Brussels Sprouts, Cornichons and Dijon Mustard Jus. I was enraptured by the fork-tenderness of this luscious and sizable slab of belly. It reminded me a lot of the great Miso Butterscoth Pork Belly I once used to love over at Sam Mason's Tailor. With the money we were saving on the $24 Three Course Menu, I decided to order an extra appetizer of the Smoked Duck Foie Gras Terrine with Quince, Port Jelly, and Endive Remoulade. Foie as a terrine is always a consistent and safe choice and this rendition was executed with wonderful care. Pastry Chef Jennifer Yee offered a sublime tasting for desserts. My friend Donnell smiled with her whimsical presentation of a Caramel Corn Sundae with Vanilla Chantilly, Bananas and Salted Peanuts. I reciprocated her grin with a hypnotic stare after reacting to my decadent Bittersweet Chocolate Ganache Tart that was nestled beside an absolutely stunning Espresso Ricotta Foam. Donnell and I floated out of the restaurant beaming from ear to ear. Two stars for the food, two for the service, one more for another Tihany gem of a venue. Lunch for two, with wine, extra plate, tax and generous tip was $110.",3,1,2,The Jedi Foodi E.,"New York, NY",333,107,515
1.0,2/1/2010,"I'm not sure what my next steps of protest are- but if you say you're participating in ""Restaurant Week"" and if your restaurant is bookable through nycgo.com/restaurantweek - you would think that the establishment would participate in all of the listed dates of the NYC Restaurant Week event. I guess these guys didn't sign up for Restaurant Week in-full because we were told that they don't participate in Restaurant Week on Sunday nights, after we booked through NYCGO.com/Restaurantweek, and we called to confirm their participation. It gets silly because they weren't even 25% full and they let us leave without compromise. They didn't bend on this ""No Sundays of Restaurant Week"" snafu, even though we called twice to confirm participation - they offered us a la carte menus. The vibe was really stale, and like I said - It was 8pm and they were not even 25% full. We had one round of drinks, whipped out our iPhone to figure out where we would go for a restaurant week treat, and we were off to Les Halles in a cab. They're also silly because all 4 members of our party are telling everyone who we see about this craziness.

But at least Les Halles plays Restaurant Week fairly, as I'm sure many other restaurants do too. I think my next step is to write NYCGO.com to report that they shouldn't advertise restaurants who do not agree to participate all of the listed days of The advertised ""Restaurant Week.""",0,2,0,Julie H.,"Little Rock, AR",17,115,7
3.0,1/29/2010,"I went here for the RW menu. The first course was pretty small as expected, but the main course was a good size. I had the potato leek ravioli - very good; the pork belly - excellent, barely any fat; and the corn caramel sundae, which was just ordinary.

5.0,1/27/2010,"Unbelievable meal, along with wonderful service, you definitely will leave impressed and have great memories of an amazing meal.Our 3 course meal turned into 6-7 courses with the free mini courses served to us between our meal.Had the $55 3 course Pre-Theater meal served from 5-6 PM.  They also offer an $84 3 course, $108 5 course, and $138 5 course chef's tasting menu.Pre-course:Amouse bouche - scallop ceviche with pomegranate seeds.  Quite tasty and much better than the scallop dish we had from Knife and Fork.Breads:Apple bread roll - absolutely AMAZING, probably the best bread I have ever had.  There's a slice of apple baked onto the top, and bits of apple inside the roll.  Perfectly textured and sweet to the taste.  I'm having withdrawal already.  Tried their selection of other breads and all were amazingly textured, buttery, and soft inside, just perfect.  I'd pay to just eat bread here all night.First course:MUSSEL BISQUE  - Steamed mussles, brioche croutons, celery seed oilPretty amazing dish.  The bisque was perfectly flavored, not too heavy, and the mussels were amazing.CHESTNUT TOTELLINI  - Pecorino Cheese, sage, pomegranate seeds, brown butter sauceAmazing dish, the butter sauce was superb and just salty enough without going over.  The cheese was rich and had a smoky flavor.Main Course:FARM RAISED CHICKEN BREAST - Potato puree, caramelized onions, vegetable crudites, chicken jusBest chicken breast I've had.  It was brined and perfectly juicy and moist inside.  At times, it just melted in your mouth.  Only complaint was that the caramelized onions could have been a little better, but everything else was fantastic.BEEF TENDERLOIN - Haricot vert, parsnip puree, pearl onions, horseradish beef jusJust the best beef tenderloin of all time.  The cut was a good portion and melted in your mouth.  Just the perfect blend of fat.  The sauce went perfectly and left you wanting more and more.  Definitely the dish of the trip.Pre Dessert:Cranberry slushy with banana chantilly cream - the chantilly cream was amazing.  There were bits of apples and gelatin at the bottom making this a very light dessert starterDessert:ROASTED PINEAPPLE VACHERIN  - frozen yogurt, basil, red currantLight dessert, but not really a big fan of pineapple.  This dish was just ok.BITTERSWEET CHOCOLATE GANACHE TART  - espresso caramel, vanilla chantilly, hazelnutVery very good ganache, and perfectly sweet.  A good end of the meal, or so we thought.Post dessert:A selection of chocolates: tried the passionfruit ganache chocolate (pretty good), and banana chocolate (not very good).  And if that wasn't enough, they gave us a little to go bag of mini muffins.  Which reminds me, I haven't tried those yet!!  Bill came out to $150 for the two of us, and a dinner we'll never forget.",0,0,0,Henry L.,"Fremont, CA",49,53,0

It was essentially a few pieces of thin fish and had some pretty garnishings on top.For the mains, we tried the skate wing and the pork belly.  The fish was perfectly crisp on the outside and soft on the inside.  It was accompanied with spinach, mini cauliflowers and capers.  The pork belly had the perfect balance of meat and ""fat"".  It was accompanied by some apple sort of sauce and brussel sprouts.

5.0,12/7/2009,"So for our three month wedding anniversary (don't hate, we get to be cheesy newlyweds) J and I decided to head into the city to celebrate. We wanted good food and had been to Aureole in Vegas as part of our engagement so we figured--why not try the NY branch?The restaurant itself is lovely--it reminded us of the Vegas layout. I like the seperation of the bar and main dining room--which is where we were seated. We were seated right with our backs to the bar and I honestly did not notice that any noise from the bar bothered us, as other reviewers have said.The service was FANTASTIC! With help from the sommelier, we went with a nice 2007 sauvignon blanc2007, a  Selene from Hyde Vineyard in Napa Valley. For dinner we decided on the 7 course Chef's Tasting menu. Our food was as follow:Amuse bouche~fois gras and duck terrinne--DELICIOUS! It just melted in your mouth. I know it is a small bite, but I really wish we had had more!First~Yellow Fin Tuna Tartare, with daikon radish nori toast points. Again, awesome. The presentation was just lovely and taste wise, this was probably the best tuna tartare we have had.Second~Sea Scallop Sandwich--I had been dying to try this based on reviews and was very happy that we got to. It was delicious! The passionfruit, scallop and fois gras just seem like such a weird combo, but in your mouth those flavors just work! J always said he hated scallops...however, after trying this he said he will give them another chance as he too enjoyed it!Third~Wild Turbot w/ blood orange,swiss chard, beet vinaigrette--my least favorite. I am NOT a fan of beets and without them the fish, though well cooked, was just bland. This was the least flavorful dish.Maybe if the blood orange had been more prominent, it would have worked better for me.Fourth~German Style Sausage-so, so good!!! The presentation on this was lovely too...which surprised me as I normally don't think of sausage presentation as lovely! The pomegrante mustard was a surprisingly good accompaniment to this dish--very unexpected!Fifth~NY Strip Loin, potato fondant, bucheron cheese--this dish had beets as well, but I was able to ignore them. The meat was just melt in your mouth goodness and the potato was a nice side with it.Palate Cleanser~a pomegrante ice w/ fresh whipped cream. Night and light!For dessert, we switched from the wine to martinis--I had the Aureole (the passionfruit in it was delicious) and J had an Expresso martini.Sixth~Chilled Concord Grape Soup--this was so refreshing going down! The pear and the grapes worked so well together.Seventh~Dark Chocolate Torte w/ Ricotta Sorbet--this was more a fudge than a torte and SO SO decadent and yummy. I wish I could eat this every single day. Petit Four Tray~um, YUM! I had a peanut butter cup, white chocolate bark and some roasted almond chocolate. Our server (again AMAZING) informed us that the restaurant has it's own chocolate room where everything is made. Very cool.And lastly, we were given the warm madelines (we had those with breakfast yesterday, VERY tasty).

Three course tasting menu that was well executed and presented. Service was top notch as well. We started with Hawaiian Ono Tataki and the pumpkin ravioli. These were both tasty starters. I don't often see Ono outside of Hawaii. My wife had the Sturgeon and I had the Colorado Lamb Loin. Both were excellent and the lamb was perfectly done. We finished with the pumpkin tart. This was very good as well and I loved that their menu took advantage of the seasonal offerings.

4.0,11/26/2009,"When does $84 for dinner seem like a bargain? When three courses feel more like eight and you have such excellent service throughout that it reminds you why New York is one of the best dining cities in the world.  My plan was Le Bernardin, but unfortunately it is closed on Sunday. So I decided to try Charlie Palmer's restaurant for our splurge meal in New York. Since we were staying in the theatre district, this swanky spot was within walking distance, yet far enough off Broadway so it wasn't in the thick of tourist insanity.We skipped the boisterous bar and went for the full experience in the quieter dining room. There are two prix fixe options for dinner. A three-course menu or five-course parallel tasting menu which must be ordered by two at the table. We opted for the three-course menu and selected different dishes for each course.My meal started off very well with the Yellow Fin Tuna Tartar with Nori toast points. It was served with playful elegance since the tuna was formed into the shape of an egg with the miso sake dressing as the yoke on top. My main course was the Prime NY Strip Loin with beets and Buchron cheese. Complex and interesting, the only thing that didn't please me on the plate was the brussel sprout puree.  The enjoyment of the first two courses was dampened by the dessert course. We ordered the Chocolate Gingerbread and Milk Chocolate Pudding Pie and although they were plated beautifully, I didn't particularly enjoy the mix of flavors.It was our fine dining experience in the city and although $84 sounds excessive, there were so many supplements that it left me feeling pretty pleased with the overall experience. From the apple tartlet on the bread tray we couldn't stop eating, to the amuse bouche to begin our meal and mignardises of warm beignets and a chocolate tray to end it, the service was excellent throughout. As our meal concluded, we were also given madeleines in a bag to enjoy with our breakfast the following day. A classy way to the end the meal.I enjoy going to nicer places, but typically order some of the least expensive items on the menu. Here I didn't feel like our service was diminished in any way because we weren't the fat cats in the room. I'm not the person that feels like you have to have a 15 minute chat with the sommelier before choosing a bottle of wine, but clearly those around me enjoyed that level of service. It wasn't a complete success, but it certainly was a delicious bite of the Big Apple.",5,4,3,Jen K.,"West Linn, OR",506,1930,6667
3.0,11/11/2009,"Charlie Palmer's Michelin-starred restaurant, Aureole, just off of Times Square is like Times Square itself.  It is confined, loud, and dazzling to the eyes, but whereas Times Square can be a tourist trap, Aureole is more of a foodie trap.  The restaurant is properly a main bar and a formal dining room.  The bar is packed with businessmen standing shoulder to shoulder, rows deep making for an animated scene.  But it wasn't anywhere you could have a relaxing drink -- more like a frat bar where all of the brothers have earned their MBAs.  It was my hope that the main dining room would be more sedated, grander in both decor and purpose.  Not so much.  I loved the vases of fresh flowers whose bouquet greeted newly arrived guests, but it was barely any quieter here than it was on the main floor.  Often people at our table had to repeat themselves to be understood.  The main server's soft-spoken voice was all but lost as he explained each course.  In the course of a 4 hour meal, this really failed to let up.We opted for the parallel tasting menu.  But with that said, there was an entreaty to include Charlie Palmer's signature dish, the scallop sandwich, into the lineup.  While this would seemingly interrupt the progression of a planned tasting menu, the kitchen easily accommodated this request.Amuse Bouche:    smoked salmon served with dressed chanterelles and dots of beet gelee.  This was okay as a beginning, though the tastes did not come together in any coherent way.First Course:  Tuna two ways.  First it was served as a tartare with accompanying nori toast points.  Outside of the monolithic presentation, there were flavorful supplements in each of the cardinal directions to enhance the gustatory experience.  I found the tuna to be very fresh and it matched well with the toast points, but the inclusion of new flavors really did not work.  The second way was more ambitious, read muddled.  There was a poached quail egg, olive, orange oil, chili pepper, etc.  While it looked gorgeous, it proved to me an amalgamation of flavors that were again incoherent.  Unofficial second course:  the diver sea scallop ""sandwich"".  If this is Palmer's signature, I suggest he buy a rubber stamper to sign his name instead.  A sea scallop can be a beautiful thing when it is nicely seared and cooked so that it brings out the taste of the ocean and its natural sweetness.  All of this was lost here.  The sandwich rounds were oily.  The pairing with foie gras was not natural and surprisingly awkward in execution.  Instead of putting the scallop on display,  it was tucked away behind a distracting mess, and I found it offensive to use passion fruit to bring back sweetness to the dish after having masked the natural sweetness of the scallop.Official second course:  turbot served two ways.  First it was wild turbot from the English channel served with sun chokes, Swiss chard, blood oranges, and a warm yellow beet vinaigrette.  The flavor in the fish was noticeably flat.  It was so disarming to bite into the flesh and taste nothing.  The accompanying sauce had to be applied thoroughly to resurrect this offering.  The alternative presentation was farm-raised turbot from Chile served with salsify, braised cardoons, cipollini onions, and perigueux sauce.  This was decidedly better and was executed quite well.  For the first time in the meal, there was coherency in the flavors, and ingredient choices made sense. Third course:  prime NY strip loin and braised beef short rib.  The two cuts of loin served au jus were perfectly prepared and beautiful to regard.  They were enhanced by the inclusion of turnips, pureed brussels sprouts, and bucheron cheese.  The short rib was perfectly braised endowing it with a complex, sophisticated flavor.  The rib was dressed with hen of woods mushrooms providing a natural earthiness as well as red cabbage, and sauce bavaroise.  Over all this course was just perfect in execution and taste.  It would be the only course of the evening that left me very pleased.Fourth course:  Two desserts.  The first was a warm pear and red wine strudel served with a dried fruit compote and vanilla ice cream.  I was impressed by how fresh and flavorful the fruit was.  The ice cream was unremarkable though, and the strudel otherwise was pedestrian.  The second dessert was a classic tarte tatin served with Calvados and creme Anglaise.  The creme Anglaise was nicely done, but otherwise I labored through this dish not enjoying any of it.  Both of the desserts felt like they came from a different era.  They could just of well have served baked Alaska and achieved the same effect.  Mignardises:  heavy donut balls and a flatware tray of mixed chocolates for a table of 6.  No pretense, entirely unceremonial making for a stark ending.At $168 for my food and espresso, I know I could have had a much better meal elsewhere, Le Bernardin for example.  There is not much to really recommend this place.  Pass.",10,4,5,Jim U.,"Washington, DC",690,1303,3044
4.0,11/11/2009,"Chef Lee must really listen to his inner child. His dishes are playful and instantly put a smile on your face (as well as quite a powerful taste in your mouth!). The new Aureole has a beautiful dining room, good service and a decent wine list. Our amuse was a mortadella which was pretty good but not extraordinary. The rest of our dishes however, were mostly delicious.STARTERS: * DIVER SEA SCALLOP ""SANDWICH"" - Seared foie gras, sugar snap peas, passion fruit, chives.* SAUTÉED FOIE GRAS - Caramel popcorn, jalapeno, toasted almond, funnel cake, gala apple consomme.My scallop sandwich was so incredibly moist, rich and tasty, the flavor combinations went so incredibly well together and this dish also combined three of my favorites: Scallops, Foie Gras, and Passion Fruit. Yum. I tasted the sauteed foie gras and honestly it is so massive you might mistaken it at a first glance for a steak. But such a colorful and fun dish with the pop corn and the cotton candy pudding-like accompaniment. Sweet and savory and incredibly rich.I have never tasted white truffles. I know, it's absurd isn't it? Luckily it is white truffle season and Aureole had a risotto with white truffles which completely blew my mind. I don't think I have ever in my life eaten something so incredibly slow. I savored each bite in absolute ecstasy. They were also very generous with the shear amount of truffle shavings that were put onto my dish table side.MAINS:* YELLOW FIN TUNA ""WELLINGTON"" - Porcini mushrooms, spinach, foie gras, red wine reduction.* PRIME NY STRIP LOIN - Baby beets, brussel sprouts, potato fondant, boucheron cheese, natural beef jus. * COLORADO LAMB LOIN - Tuscan kale, black garlic, lima & cranberry beans, cherry tomato confit.My tuna was okay, it wasn't particularly extraordinary though it was well cooked. It just could have used more flavor, more of a punch. The strip loin was fantastic, I wish I had ordered this dish and the lamb was perfectly seasoned as well. SPICED PUMPKIN SOUFFLÉ TART - Granny smith, Leche merengada, huckleberry.SWEET PETE'S BLUE CHEESECAKE - Port poached mission figs, quince, walnut leaves. CARAMEL PANNA COTTA - Warm banana bread, galangal, candied coconut.My pumpkin souffle was so moist and delicious, it is rare that I steer away from chocolate when it comes to my dessert but I love pumpkin. But the caramel panna cotta was fantastic. And the cheesecake was interesting. It wasn't what you would expect from cheese cake, it was a savory dish, like a creamed pungent cheese cake, definitely not what I expected. I definitely think this place is worth the trip, but some of the dishes are hit or miss. Any of the foie gras dishes were worth it, as was the risotto. The desserts were also hit or miss, interesting, and could use some more work. But the homemade truffles that are brought to the table at the very end were all extremely fantastic and delicious. Special occasion dining? Worth a go. This place has definitely personality and potential.",3,0,2,Nicole C.,"New York, NY",124,299,3

3.0,11/11/2009,"Aureole is as polarizing as any restaurant i've wandered across in recent times.  Perhaps more dividing than a certain Alaskan ex-Senator, an un-named plumber, or past Presidents with middle names starting with the letter 'W'.You want to immediately dislike the restaurant, given its proximity to Times Square.  The patrons in the bar area are raucous, rowdy, and badly dressed (BAC - bad dressers across the board).But the main dining area, enclosed with noise dampening glass, is serene, elegant and beautiful.  Dining room patrons can leer at the chaos in the bar area, though i'm reminded of a certain proverb concerning glass houses - we've all been there before.The evening progressed with a parade of plates from the parallel tasting menu.  Given Chef de Cuisine Chris Lee's classic French training, and an invisible hand of guidance from Chef Patron Charlie Palmer, the menu is progressive, yet retains classical elements of French cookery;  the plating is exquisite, and the service is impeccable.But it's the food that put our table at odds;  injurious with the rankings of Sam Sifton's lone star(!) assessment and Michelin's assessment of a single star (which is usually commensurate with 2-3 star rankings from the NYT).Even more polarizing, our table bickered endlessly at the quality of execution.  A preparation of wild European Turbot, delicately sauced with a sunchoke puree, swiss chard and beet vinaigrette was one of my favorite dishes of the night, though others felt it too bland.  I also enjoyed the braised short rib, sauced with a bavaroise foam and accompanied by red cabbage and hen-of-the-woods mushrooms, though others felt it 'stringy' and 'fibrous'.The New York strip loin preparation was overwhelmed by the grassiness of a brussels sprout puree, though others seemed to find harmony in this balance of flavors.  I also found the pear tarte tatin with a calvados creme anglaise to be overwhelmingly saccharine, but most of the other diners finished theirs with gusto.  We all did agree that the famous scallop 'sandwich', was one of the better dishes of the night - just a simple preparation of crusted sea scallop, adorned with an expertly seared piece of foie gras - a truly luxurious dish.  We also all agreed that the duo of preparations of Yellowfin tartare and tataki wouldn't have been missed if they failed to make an appearance on the menu.Given the mixed reviews of the food, the odd location, and the especially high price point, doesn't make this an easy sell.  A dinner tab near the 2 century mark should commensurate to a 5 star dining experience, but Aureole missed that mark by a long shot.  I'll resonate Sam Sifton's quip on this restaurant - it deserves a solid, ""Meh"".",11,7,7,Chris H.,Hong Kong,170,603,2140
4.0,10/24/2009,"Aureole definitely doesn't suck....First let's talk about the bar.  I'd be happy to go to Aureole for a drink and a snack any day of the week.  The drinks are excellent, the wines by the glass are top notch and they give you a taste before you commit,  but the beer list is a little short.  The snacks are outstanding.  The pastrami pork belly sliders win.   The dish is a plate of 3 mini pork belly reubens.  Fantastic.  The fluke sashimi is artfully done, with the top of the fish resting on diced edamame and the tail with a dollop of yuzu eggplant puree.  Combine that with the ginger shallot dressing and it is a real winner.  Also well worth the calories are the papas fritas and the sardines.The bar room food is also good but not up to the superlatives i've given to the bar snacks.   The lobster roll is good, but not the best in the city (try Pearl Oyster Bar.)  The burger is good, but doesn't stand out in a city awash in burgers.  The ribeye is good, but predictable.   The tuna tartare was good, but it doesn't stand out from any of the other tuna/egg dishes found in sushi places all over the city.  Overall,  I think the sit down bar room menu is solid, worth a trip if you find yourself in the area, but not special.I haven't tried the dinning room proper, but I am looking forward to it.  Before that happens, i'm sure i'll go back for a slider and a glass of wine...",0,0,0,Kurt V.,"Newport Beach, CA",8,36,0

The ""bread"" part of the sandwich was crispy goodness, and the scallop was perfectly cooked. It also comes with a drizzle of chicken jus, so you really can't go wrong there. The halibut with creamed corn and gnocchi was simple and well cooked. Among the many desserts that we sampled, the corn souffle with blueberries was the best - warm, sweet and gooey.

Their entrance is just to the right of Conde Nast, so Anna and team can always grab a quick, chic bite. It's a double height room with an impressive wine display on the 2nd floor, encased behind a huge, curved piece of glass.  Everyone raved about their dishes. My hostess and I both ordered the softshell crab BLT. It was a hearty and rich dish, not for dieters. A chunky piece of crab between what looked like two brioche-pancakes. My boss had the gazpacho with an octopus appetizer, and our other host had the branzino, which was served with flourish as our poor waitress poured too-hot-broth over it.

I will agree with a previous poster that the entrees aren't as adventurous as I'd like them to be. However there's something to be said for simple food done perfectly which is what you get there. We had the tuna tartar which was fantastic and oysters which you cant got wrong with (unless you get bad oysters) and then I had the chicken and she had the pork chop and both of us came away from it more than happy with what we paid for. The desserts were also terrific and I don't always find that to be so at the high end places as they try a little too hard to go outside the box And as for the non food aspects the space is beautiful simple and elegant and the service was quite good although you could tell that it was still getting some bugs out ...we did have to ask for bread but other than that i was very pleased.,0,0,0,andy W.,"Flushing, NY",137,73,0
3.0,9/8/2009,"It's places like Aureole that give me mixed signals about going out to higher-end restaurants in New York.  The ambiance is fantastic, the design is top notch, and the food is entirely excellent; but is it memorable?  Like Chris Lee, in a word, no.  Its proximity to Times Square alone should raise some red flags.As mentioned, the food here is great-  the flavor combinations are classic, the textures are unique and differentiated, but its just entirely too ""I took everything out of culinary school and applied it"" safe. Yes, the scallops are warm, tender, and creamy.  The pork is well seasoned and chews with a buttery consistency.  But I expect that as a minimum of any New York restaurant at this dog-eat-dog price point.  There's no risk-taking here, not much creativity, and just not enough to warrant a $75+ per person price tag (non-prix fixe):- Tuna Tartare with Miso (very creative)- Scallop with Foie Gras (just add bacon and truffle slices and you can't lose)- Grilled Burger with Bacon (are you serious?)- Farm Raised Chicken (*facepalm*)With hindsight being 20/20, I would have ordered two appetizers rather than a main course as they were much more nuanced and thoughtful than the run-of-the-fancy-mill halibut or pork chop.  The by-the-glass wine list was also surprisingly limited for the number of bottles they have (both in the display case and in the gigantic vault hidden away), but this may just be a function of the type of typical clientele.In my experience, restaurants with anything over $15 per entree starts having exponentially diminishing returns the higher you get.  In truth, I don't care about service, decor, fancy plates, or a wine list;  my ""dining experience"" revolves around if the food tastes unique and delicious.  $20 goes a long way in NYC food-terms, and at $37 per entree alone, I was expecting it to be slightly more cutting edge, adventurous, and just plain tasty.Great experience overall, but I won't be coming back until the menu changes and my dollars become worth it.",0,0,0,Victor C.,"San Francisco, CA",22,83,158
5.0,9/6/2009,"OMFingG, this place was fantastic. I first went to the old location on the Upper East, to be told by the window that the location had moved to midtown...right by Times  Square. I thought this was a horrid idea, but that quickly changed once I got there. We were seated very quickly, thank you reservations, and were given a wine list (book), and some menus. We decided to have a bottle of white and red. The sommelier pretty much spouted Wine Porn at us, haha, he was so knowledgeable, and adorable, and we finally chose two. I also really like the wine celler that you can see above you. It's glass so the wine is a decor for the entire restaurant.  For dinner we had the chef prepare us a 7 course tasting menu. It was fantastic. Everything was delicious, and I think I got more and more excited as each dish came out. I will say that the scallops with foie gras was probably the most amazing thing I have tried in awhile.  I have nothing negative to say about this place. It was fantastic in every way, the wait staff was awesome. I think you should really go here!",1,1,1,Nikki H.,"Boulder, CO",1274,465,211
5.0,9/4/2009,"This place lived up to my expectations (AND MORE). We both ordered a prix fixe meal: The bread was delicious (more than 5 options, too). I ate this wonderfully simple butter roll. I may have been really hungry, because I flagged down the waiter and got 2 more for the wait-time in between dishes. Shameless.For the first course, we had the Diver Sea Scallop ""Sandwich"" and the yellowfin tuna tartar. Okay, for some reason, I was completely expecting scallops on a bread roll. And i was excited by that notion because in my head any kind of sandwich that's not a pb and j one is fancy for me. In any case, the dish came with scallops in between these fishy-tasting bread chips. Awkward to cut (I ended up sneaking the last one in with my hand)...but so delicious. The scallops were well-cooked (although I've had better), but the sauce and the crunchiness of the outside 'bread' pieces were so delicious  My dinner-partner had the tuna tartar. Raw fish has never tasted so good. The dish was amazingly simple but so refined. The taste of the tartar upon first bite was completely different from its taste upon swallowing.Second course:Canadian Lobster Tail Vs. Berkshire Pork Belly and the Crispy Black Sea Bass. I can't explain the ""versus"" part of my dish. I imagined a lobster claw speared towards the pork belly (Why was my perception of each dish so off? Could have been the strawberry martini that i had. Which by the way was delicious). In the past, my only experience with pork belly was when my mom brought back a 10 dollar box from Chinatown. And that was already delicious. The pork belly was so deliciously fatty and the flavors (gooseberries and that bubbly frilly almond emulsion) were great. The lobster tail was probably the best I've had ever in my lifetime (but really, this is comparing to a lobster I've had on a cruise...and in Red Lobster). The dish itself looked wonderful, with two separate niches for my two wonderfully cooked meats. My dinner partner had the sea bass, which was also delicious, although I must admit I preferred mine much more. DESSERTDESSERTDESSERTAt this point in the review I should introduce my waiter. Suave, debonair, and very smooth with his one liners (""Your beer levels are reaching a critical low...need another?"" HAAAH.) So i read on yelp that the dessert had its own sub-courses. I was confused when the dessert menu was a standard menu. I ordered my caramel panna cotta and my partner ordered Sweet Corn Souffle. But to my confusion, my waiter brought us a small dish with a strawberry sorbet-type thing. That ain't what i ordered. But it was delicious. Next came our real desserts. Both were heavenly. Magnificent. To die for. I could eat it forever, for every meal, every second. The panna cotta was a little sweet after too many bites (i can't expect differently when 'candied coconut' is in the dish), so i ended up switching for the souffle (blueberry chutney). At this point in my meal I embarked on my standard end of the meal bathroom trip. But no! My waiter comes up to us and presents us a dish of chocolate. The most magnificent chocolate ever that makes Godiva pale in comparison - he pointed to each piece and explained our options (including espresso macaroons, Cinnamon chocolate, etc). He saw my sad/confused eyes. He knew exactly what was wrong with me. He smiles and says 'You can have as many as you want'. I've never been in love like this before. I took 3 pieces with me in a muffin goodybag that they gave us when we left. And i enjoyed it later that night. A wonderful experience, my only regret is that I never got my waiter's name.",0,1,0,Karina L.,"Boston, MA",184,456,180

5.0,9/2/2009,"First trip to the new space and of course was concerned with the 42nd st. address vs. the old 61st st.  townhouse.  My feeling is that beauty and ambiance of the latter was not compromised, but rather enhanced, by the former.  There are two dining experiences to be had at Aureole.  The front room (grill, bar, whatever you want to call it) is bustling and lively.  The room is sleak, high ceilinged and fits the part of it's new fast paced home.  The back room (main dining room) is white linen, soft lighting and banquets - much the same aire as le Bernadin (for example).  This is where mi'lady and I dined.Service was just as you would hope.  Friendly but not cloying.  Attentive.  Happy to give their opinion (both our head waiter and sommolier gave great recommendations) and above all - not pretentious in the least.  You felt like they were really happy to see you enjoy the experience.The food - dead on.  My yellowtail tartar ap. was inventive and the main course of wild salmon was superb.  Could have gone in many other directions - one can't go wrong.  For dessert, my wife wanted the cheese plate and our waiter said something to the effect of ""with all these great choices anything but the cheese plate.  you could go to Murray's and get a fine cheese plate.  select something else and if it's not perfect I'll bring you the cheese plate anyway.""  She chose an incredible dessert and finished it and as we were finishing our coffee the cheese plate came out anyway - on the house.  Oh, and then the hand made chocolates including peanut brittle like I've never had before.With bottle of wine and a cocktail the bill was under $300 (including tax) because of a 15% off promotion they are running to attract patrons to the new space.Along with Le Bernadin, Scalini Fedeli and Jean Gorges - Aureole is at the head of the class for a special occasion.",2,0,1,Andy G.,"Austin, TX",20,103,0

5.0,8/6/2009,"Until last Tuesday night, if asked where I had enjoyed my greatest meal in New York, I would have replied: 'Hmm... Prune.  Either sitting at the bar with my brother, sucking down bone marrow, and indecisively sharing a slew of starters and entrees under the attentive eye of the lesbian bartender... or picking apart a whole roasted Branzini with my boyfriend at the same place.  Or perhaps, luxuriating for hours at the Michelin-starred Public with my boyfriend, brother, and best friend Bree.  I still remember the scallops!'  Now, without question, it's Aureole, Charlie Palmer's chic new digs at the Bank of America Building off Bryant Park.In a gorgeous private dining room reserved for diners trying the reasonable $84 dollar three-course pre-fix, exquisite food made up for the piped-in elevator music that I hope will be replaced.  This is American cuisine at it's best... and we paired it, shamelessly, with a White Burgundy.If an amuse bouche is intended to, literally, amuse your mouth, the White Asparagus Soup with Watercress ""Caviar"" and Tapioca did exactly that.  Not an overpowering start to a meal, but texturally playful, and beautiful.  My boyfriend started with the Diver Sea Scallop ""Sandwich"" with Pan Seared Foie Gras, Sugar Snap Peas, Passion Fruit, and Chives.  This starter, pictured in the Time Out New York article announcing Aureole's chic new location, was one of the stars of the evening.  A perfect scallop, cooked between paper thin Pullman toasts, giving a lot of texture to every bite.  The savory foie gras was beautiful with the sweet passion fruit reduction.  Charmed by the smoked corn bread, and the mix of sweet and spicy, I chose the Sauteed Foie Gras with Maine Blueberries, Smoked Corn Bread, Pickled Jalapenos and Macadamia nuts.  The corn bread was a bit overpowering, but the foie gras practically disintegrated on the tongue!It's hard to prepare veal and sweetbreads without having them feel unseasonably heavy, but my Veal Tenderloin with Sweetbreads, Haricot Verts (an unannounced substitute for wild asparagus), Charred Onion, Georgia Peaches, Pickled Ramps, and Lovage Veal Jus arrived and felt like a gift of summer.  The dish had underlying Asian and Southern notes, and David noted that the veal was so tender, you could slice it with a credit card!His entrée, Canadian Lobster Tail Vs. Berkshire Pork Belly with Squash, Porcini Mushrooms, Cape Goosberries, Jura Wine and Almond Emulsion was lovely!  However, placed on two opposite sides of the rectangular plate, the win was apparent: putting this poor pork belly against the most masterfully cooked piece of lobster I've ever tasted was like throwing a little league team into Yankee stadium.  The pork was the only forgettable dish of the night.After dinner, a rhubarb sorbet, with Tapioca pudding, was intended to serve as a palate cleanser, but was so oppressively sweet, I had one bite and pushed it aside so I might still have some feeling in my tongue.  Good thing; the desserts were extraordinary!  Sweet Corn Souffle with Blueberry Chutney, and Brown Butter was served with a tart frozen yogurt.  David didn't care for the Chilled Strawberry Soup with Queso Fresco, Cilantro, and Ancho Meringue but that's due to his dislike of cilantro in general.  I thought it was a revelation!  To have a dessert with this much bite provided a much-needed detour from the severe sweet that had preceded it.  A cone of petite, Chinese style donuts were brought out, along with a sampling of treats from the house chocolatier.All in all, it was some of most artfully prepared food I've tasted... Mr. Palmer has earned his own personal halo for this!  And, with 15% off all checks until September 15th, you will never get such bang for your buck.  GO!  (everyone's doing it...  well, ok, not everyone... but we did see Gael Greene licking her fork in the a la carte dining room!)more at Traveling Tongue:blog.seanpatrickdoyle.com",1,0,0,SP D.,"New York, NY",5,21,1

After earning two Michelin stars at Gilt, Charlie Palmer quickly made Chef Lee an offer he didn't refuse.Enough history. The big idea behind bringing in a young, creative, talented chef such as Lee into an established restaurant is also about ushering in the next 20 years for Aureole in it's brand new location with a fresh twist. The space itself is amazing. As you walk into the main bar/bistro room you are amazed by the softly inviting halo chandelier hanging over the 60+ seats and bar stools. While you'll be able to order a la carte from the fine dining menu, you'll also have the option of typical bistro selections such as steak frites, and classic burgers...all with Chef Lee's elegant touch. The fine dining room is right off the bistro room but hidden behind glazed glass to allow an intimate feel for special occasions. For those looking to entertain bigger groups, Aureole also boasts a banquet room that is sure to impress the most distinguished foodie. Beyond the Adam Tihany design and amazing New American cuisine at Aureole, both Charlie Palmer and Christopher Lee are just really down to earth, nice guys. On his recent appearance on Top Chef Master's, a spin off of Bravo's Top Chef, Lee's upbeat personality and lighthearted yet confident approach to the competition made him feel like a guy you'd want to hang out with for more than just his amazing culinary skills!

I believe that their exec chef (not Charlie Palmer, but the dude who actually runs the kitchen here) is going to appear on TC Masters starting in a couple days.So let me just start out by saying that any restaurant where dessert alone has three courses is allright by me. I mean, really, dessert had its own amuse bouche (a cherry tapioca pudding shooter) and was followed by a plate of delectable homemade bon-bons and beignets! These are all in addition to the main event, which was a beautifully-presented chocolate-banana tart with salted caramel ice cream. Are you kidding?! Life's short....review dessert first.After much research, dude and I chose dinner at Aureole for celebrating our fifth wedding anniversary. The date fell on their final night in this location and, despite that fact, the staff was as patient and lovely as could be. We were treated like one would hope to be treated on a special occasion.We went for the 5-course chef's tasting menu (one course for every year...) and it was a smashing success. Sometimes in tasting menus the dishes are hit or miss--some good, some not so good. In this case, each course was a hit. Seriously, every dish was gorgeous, with well-balanced textures and outrageously delicious flavors. Our heads were almost exploding by the time we got to the aforementioned dessert!If you're doing the prix-fixe where you can choose dishes, I echo the others on here in recommending the scallop ""sandwich.""

I did try the bone marrow but I would choose other side dishes....just not my cup of tea.I was disappointed with the main desserts (had a rum raisin souffle which was overly sweet) and my husband had the banana chocolate tartlet.....standard chocolate round tart.  But, the desserts were saved by these amazing complimentary beignets I think they are called...gently sugared mini-donuts.....they should offer this on the regular menu along with all sorts of dipping sauces.Farewell Aureole and I look forward to seeing you at the new location......the new place will offer fine dining at prix fix prices and casual dining at a la carte prices....so there will be 2 different dining rooms depending what you choose (prix fix or a la carte)....

5.0,2/17/2009,"i went to aureole about 5 years ago for lunch for restaurant week and was impressed then by the food. however, i hadn't tried it for dinner and was really excited to go this past week. part of going to dinner was to have a small reunion with my elementary school friends, one of whom is the pastry chef at aureole. she made sure that we were taken care of -- probably more than we deserved.the dinner is prix fixe - i ordered the japanese hamachi sashimi as a starter. the hamachi was fresh, and adorned with a small piece of uni - definitely a nice touch. others in my party ordered the poached egg (was nice and frothy and the grits were a good mushy) and the yellow fin tuna tartare (sizable portion for tartare). the staff at aureole also brought out other appetizer items that i fail to remember right now, but everything at that moment tasted so damn good. i ordered the venison for my main course -- the flavor was not too gamey and the meat was oh so tender. everyone else was raving about their entrees (the strip loin, and fish entrees). for dessert, well my friend ended up having each item off the dessert menu (except for the cheeses) brought to our table to be shared, most likely to show off to us. oh man, gastric explosion! the desserts were rocking -- i was particularly fond of the creme brulee trio and the asian pear tarte tatin. i'd go back just for those items.special thanks to our elementary school friend for making our dining at aureole a memorable occasion.",1,1,1,Sal C.,"Forest Hills, NY",64,68,5
5.0,1/16/2009,"The meal I had recently at Aureole was a wonderful experience.  The tab was picked up by someone else, so I was able to enjoy the menu without thinking about $'s.  We had the Prix Fixe dinner.  They started us off with an excellent amuse bouche of cipollini onion tart with smoked salmon and Meyer lemon puree.  It was a beautiful little dish and had a great deal of flavor and ingenuity.  I had a Hamachi Sashimi starter that was also very good.  It came with a beer foam that I felt was an unnecessary sour counterpoint to the yellowtail, as they had already accompanied with a yuzu sauce and some baby shiso and sea urchin.  The sea urchin carried enough flavor of the sea to make the well crafted beer foam superfluous (its big word day for me apparently, they say fish is brain food).For the Main I had a beautifully cooked Venison tenderloin (the waiter informed  us it was elk rather than deer) that had a black cherry sauce and a small ladled potion of additional jus added tableside.  The dish was well made and well prepared, but again there was some note to the dish that didn't work.  Maybe too sweet and not tart enough...I truly am not sure.My warm chocolate fondant was fantastic and really the best chocolate desert I have had in awhile.  They also hit us with homemade chocolates and Madeline's after dessert which just sent me into overload.  Grappa was needed and it was excellent!I loved my meal and thought the service, the food and the ambiance was fantastic.  The Sommelier was very knowledgeable and took excellent care of us!Highly Recommended!",2,1,1,Jeff B.,"NY, NY",38,42,4
4.0,1/6/2009,"I've been accused of being the Eastern European gymnastics judge at the Olympics, someone who is afraid of giving out perfect scores to the early competitors.  That's true.  I have not done much fine dining, and particularly destination dining in my brief number of years, mostly because of a lack of money and lack of interest.  Luckily for my taste buds, college let me find a job to afford places like Aureole, and allowed me to meet my foodie friends.  This however, has limited my experience with this class of establishment, and until I've found the the Nadia Comaneci of restaurants, I'll reserve the 10's for something that blows me away.  [Ed.'s Note:  He does try so hard to be clever, doesn't he?]That being said, Aureole was still pretty darn good.  I ordered off the prix fixe menu and my meal consisted of:Appetizer:  Seared Foie Gras [Ed's Note:  He does love his delicious torture]Main Course:  VenisonDesert:  Trio of Creme BruleesThe foie gras was amazing.  The seared outside perfectly complimented the natural velvety texture inside.  It was served on a waffle with a sweet raspberry sauce.  There's a photo of it above.The venison was good, but nothing spectacular, although I did gain a better baseline for the natural 'gaminess' of like meats.Trio of creme brulee.  Wow.  Vanilla.  Espresso.  Pecan.  Classic.  Tried and true.  New and creative.  I love creme brulee, and this was some good creme brulee.It's a great place for a date, probably even for the nice couple we chased away from the table next to us as I was there with 6 other college friends.  [Ed.'s Note:  You should have heard what we said about you after you left!]It can be a little pricey, as we ended up dropping about $200 a person, but that was because we also had cocktails, after dinner drinks, and 2 very nice bottles of a Bordeaux my friend recommended.  Their corkage is steep ($50/bottle) and restrictive given their extensive wine list.Again, overall, I give it a 4/5 because the first restaurant of this class that I give a perfect score has really got to blow me away (or maybe just not charge me for the meal).",2,2,2,Zhi Q.,"Austin, TX",31,67,1

I had the tasting menu, which was a fabulous deal that I highly recommend. The menu included a strawberry & ricotta tart, a striped bass dish, and a lamb dish that had lamb so supple, it was like eating butter. Mmmm... We had high expectations for dessert because the-red-book-that-must-not-be-named had warned to save room for the ""show-stopping"" desserts. In reality, Aureole definitely delivered. I had the bittersweet and milk chocolate marquise, which was sinfully rich but wonderful. It was an interesting experience, too, because we ordered the creme brulee parade for the table, which included traditional creme brulee, chocolate chipotle creme brulee (pretty good!), and sweet corn creme brulee, which was...in one word...narsty.

However, I've had a few uneven dishes/experiences (lackluster dishes, rushed service, etc.), so 4 stars it is.Best App: The most memorable appetizer was a BLUE CRAB NAPOLEON (may have been a special); with a close runner-up being the TRUFFLED RABBIT AND HAM HOCK TORTELLINI which was perfectly executed (and that guilty bit of foie made me pretty happy).Best Main: without a doubt the COCONUT CURRY POACHED LOBSTER. Don't even try to kid yourself that this is ""light,"" as I did, because it is pure butter. My taste buds don't lie.Best Dessert: Its a toss-up between the BANANA GATEAU W/ FROZEN RUM CUSTARD and the CHOCOLATE MOUSSE AND PEANUT BUTTER CRUNCH, but the former may not be an option anymore so that should make it easier for you.

5.0,3/2/2008,"From start to finish, well done Aureole! First let me warn you I am extremely hungover from a weekend in new york, so struggling here to recount the lovely meal. Forgive the laundry list that follows:Service was wonderful, especially the sommelier, who helped us pick a versatile gruner veltliner and some light red (I can't remember what it was, I was a few too many drinks in by that time, but the rose champagne that I started with was amazing!).Choose the olive bread as your dinner roll; it has wonderful flavor that is really great with the whipped butter.For first course, I had the SEARED HUDSON VALLEY FOIE GRAScaramelized pears, spiced squash waffle, blackberries, roasted hazelnuts. They do not mess around here with portion size. If anything, it was way too big! I've never seen that much foie gras on a plate, and it was delicious. (of course, I am sure I have gained at least a few pounds from that course itself, but it was worth it!)For the second course, I had the CARAMELIZED DUCK BREAST WITH CANDIED KUMQUATS confit layered potatoes, mustard greens. Again, huge portions. I had about seven significant slices of duck breast (enough to pass some around the table) and the mustard greens complemented the sweet for a great balance overall. For dessert, we had a few BITTERSWEET CHOCOLATE TORTEchestnut crme anglaise, warm clementine compote, bourbon ice cream around the table. What a delicious torte, but the real treat was the bourbon ice cream. I don't even like bourbon, and it was awesome! Highly recommended.And if you don't order dessert, you still get delicious truffles and mexican cookies served on a tiny silver tray, and ladies were given a small ""breakfast"" bar to take home. I haven't eaten mine yet, but I think it is some sort of butternut squash bread with nuts. Looks really great in a cellophane bag and chocolate brown ribbon. All in all, a great time and a great meal. Other people in my party seemed to enjoy their rosemary scented sweetbreads and smoked salmon ribbons with caviar toast for first course, as well as a notable ROASTED BEEF FILET WITH WILD MUSHROOM & OXTAIL PASTRYGuinness glazed carrots, red wine reduction.A great place for a date, birthday, family celebration, etc. with a comfortable, living room atmosphere.",2,0,1,tania t.,"Los Angeles, CA",43,178,22

3.0,1/4/2007,"I hate to give what in theory is a 5 star restaurant only 3 stars, but it's the right thing to do.  I was pretty excited to go to the original Charlie Palmer restaurant, being a big fan of Dry Creek Kitchen in Sonoma County.  From DCK, I had a sense of what the food was trying to achieve and how it could taste, so I was curious and open to the east coast interpretation.  Given that Aureole is $84 price fixed for dinner, before wine, tax, gratuity, and before extra charges for items like lobster, I was imagining great things.Sadly, only good things happened.  Starting with a duo of tuna appetizer, I was instantly unhappy with the slightly unfresh, mushy texture of the dish, not to mention the microscopic portion.  There was some kind of rice cake involved, which was tasteless.  For dinner, I had the duo (a theme) of sirloin and short rib, a dish found in DCK.  It was gorgeously presented, and substantial, and pretty tasty, but remarkably salty.  My husband's crispy chicken was also salty to the point of burning lips, and The Little Owl version (in the Village) is cheaper and tastier.  The chicken was served with truffled mac and cheese that frankly completely sucked, being runny and salty.  Other dishes around the table seemed pretty good.  The fish was served in a huge portion, and a salad of wild mushrooms was enormous and tasty.  The desserts were obviously crafted by a talented pastry chef, and were the highlight.  I had a bread pudding with cheddar cheese and spiced dry fruit, which was amazing.Service was overbearing, with my pet peeve happening throughout the night--the removal of items before done and before asking.  Several glasses of wine, with another 20% left, disappeared.  Plates were wisked away while people were still eating.  Cream and sugar were removed right after the first cup of coffee was poured.  Atmosphere was bland, like a fancy, but chain, hotel restaurant.  We were sat next to a service station, that also had a giant fan, which continually pumped cold air and loud noise on us.On our way out, we thanked the manager and mentioned we had been to Dry Creek Kitchen.  He gave a little sigh, and said it was Palmer's dream for years to open that, and asked if we noticed the differences, such as lower prices and more local, seasonal produce.  I got the impression a lot of the restaurant's energy had gone there, too.Still, not a bad meal, with some interesting touches.  Neutral atmosphere, mediocre service, and about 50% misses on the dishes should be kept in mind before planning a really special night.",1,1,1,Rose S.,"Mountain View, CA",6,79,0

3.0,8/1/2006,"came here for lunch and it was pretty good.  the appetizer was ok, not memorable though since i can't remember for the life of me what i had.  i had some type of fish for an entree but it was flavorless.  dessert was delicious.  atmosphere is pretty regular, nothing out of the ordinary.  food definitely left something to be desired.",1,0,1,Valerie A.,"New York, NY",7,28,0
5.0,6/3/2006,"Aureole was sort of a 'culinary revelation' for me.   I had just moved to NY from Montreal, finished cooking school, and although I had eaten some pretty good meals back home, nothing had prepared me for Aureole's amazing food.I remember understanding for the first time what a 'perfectly' balanced martini was supposed to taste like.  I ate braised short ribs, and three years later, I can still remember their exact taste.For 3 years, I dreamed about going back.  But in NY, there are too many restaurants to try, so I waited for a very special occasion to go back.That came up recently, and we had the tasting menu.  Most of the food was very good, but it was too much food, and the 7 paired courses  clouds my memory, atlhough I do remember the scallop with butternut squash sauce being delicious.I didn't like the tasting menu as much, as I was full by the 4th course, and couldn't enjoy the rest of the food.As in other restaurants of similar sophistication, the service is excellent, if a little pretentious.  But the plush carpeting and ample space make it quite comfortable, and not feel as 'stuffy' as such a place might otherwise feel.",2,1,1,Brigitte T.,"San Francisco, CA",235,102,19
4.0,1/14/2006,"The food here was excellent, and it is perfect for a special occasion restaurant, but personally, I found it a bit stuffy.  All orders are prix fixe, and the portions are significant.  The tuna tartare was excellent, as was the lobster.  And the trio of cheesecakes were unreal.  Overall, a great dining experience, but lacking the atmosphere that would make it deserving of five starts.",0,0,0,Erica G.,"San Francisco, CA",215,181,26
4.0,1/13/2006,"If you are like me and eat out almost every night at the typical hip places (Atlantic Grill, Mesa Grill, Nobu, etc), than this is the perfect place for a ""special occasion"" dinner. Although the bill is consistently scary, it's worth every dime after you have dessert. The help couldn't be more pleasurable either. Just go and talk to Alex (the host), and you will immediately understand why this is my favorite restaurant in the city, well atleast one of the favorites.  Although the Atmosphere is for Business only (if by business I mean literally, or trying to seal the deal with a significant other), than this is a place where superstars dine. JUST BEWARE OF THE WINE TAB!",0,0,0,Chinku G.,"Hicksville, NY",21,541,0
