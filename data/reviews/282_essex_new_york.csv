3.0,4/29/2019,"Went there for a late Saturday brunch, and the only complaint I had was being sat an hour late for our reservation. The hostess didn't really seem to care that we had waited for an hour and people around us with reservations after ours wee sat before us. They did give us free drink tickets while we waited at the bar and then gave up a free round of shots once we did get our table. BUT they sat ten of us at a table made for 5.... It a pretty fun and lively environment. Loud music playing and a big crowd. The place was still packed when we left around 5. Food was decent and came out pretty fast once we ordered and the waiter made sure our glasses were full the entire time.",0,0,0,Dominique T.,"Baltimore, MD",345,4,6

2.0,4/16/2019,I went here for Sunday brunch with my boyfriend. We made a reservation prior to coming so our wait was only 5 mins. That's really the only reason I'm giving 2 stars instead of zero.  It took nearly a hour before our food arrived. Not once did our waiter come over to let us know the status of our food or apologize for the wait. My boyfriend ordered a veggie burger & it had the option to come with tempeh bacon (vegan bacon). When he got the veggie burger it came with pork bacon on it. WHY WOULD THEY PUT PORK BACON ON A VEGGIE BURGER. When we brought this to the attention of the waiter he seemed to think there was nothing wrong with it. He didn't even offer to correct this error and still charged us for the bacon. Overall a bad experience.,0,0,0,Roxanne D.,"Nanuet, NY",0,4,1

We were seated right away with a reservation and our server was very attentive, even gave us a cocktail to go and enjoy down by the bar after our time limit was up.

1.0,3/9/2019,"As someone who has worked in customer service for years, I can tell you that there's a very obvious difference between an establishment that is overly busy causing neglect of customers and one that simply does not CARE about its customers. This place is a prime example of the latter. IF YOU DONT WANT TO RUIN YOUR NIGHT, do not come here!!! This has been a sincere warning.  Details that transpired are as follows: our food took over an hour to arrive, which in and of itself is unfortunate but ultimately would not have killed the night. What occurred when this was reflected to the manager on duty is what has prompted this bad review. The manager haughtily brushed it off and told us that we should come here expecting to wait an hour. Keep in mind that this is no fancy establishment with five courses, it is an all American bar. An hour is absolutely preposterous. The good news is Absolutely Nothing about this place is unique or special. Hop a few blocks down and you'll run into another handful of these places that will have thousand times better customer service.",0,1,0,Michelle F.,"Berkeley, CA",785,25,12
2.0,3/9/2019,"I came to Essex for brunch and upon ordering my hamburger, I had requested a side of ranch dressing to dip my fries in. Unfortunately, it was brought to my attention by our waitress that this was indeed, a ranch-free establishment. You can imagine my disappointment as no side of fries is complete without a side of ranch to dip them in. Alas, I finished about half of my ""well done"" burger as it ended up being closer to the rare end of the spectrum. Overall, wouldn't recommend.Edit- Asked us to leave 15 minutes early, despite the fact that they sat us down 15 minutes late. Not pleased.",1,0,1,Megan S.,"Brooklyn, New York, NY",0,3,2

5.0,3/8/2019,"Despite the mixed reviews, my friends and I had a great time at brunch here! I made my reservation a few weeks in advance, and the place was PACKED so I highly recommend you make one for brunch. They do check IDs at the door, and they don't seat you until your full party is there. Tables were packed and the music was loud so it was a great boozy brunch vibe. We were seated immediately once my full party arrived.As soon as we sat down the waiter was already taking our bottomless drink orders which was nice. He was very attentive and never let our drinks go empty. It's a solid value too for bottomless drinks + entree at ~$36. I like that they had the option for screwdrivers too which is rare at bottomless brunch. We tried all 3 of the drinks and everyone liked them all! The screwdrivers were definitely extra strong though so beware drinking that fast. We all got different entrees and we were all pleased! It was a perfect portion of food and tasted good. There were soo many good options so it was definitely difficult to choose. Towards the end of our brunch after we had overstayed our welcome, the waiter even gave us an extra round of drinks and politely asked if we would be willing to move to the bar soon. We thought it was really nice that he gave us extra drinks so we got up and moved immediately, which wasn't a problem.Overall, had a great experience at this brunch and it'll definitely sit around the top of my favorite bottomless brunch spots!",1,0,0,Natalie K.,"New York, NY",106,67,2
4.0,3/5/2019,"If you were looking for a convention of basic bitches under the age of 29, you found it.  You walk in and immediately get ID checked.  Then find yourself pushing through a VERY crowded, VERY loud entry way of people to find the host to check in.  You can order drinks while you wait, if you can find your way to the bar.  The manager and I found each other and he was extremely nice.  He gave me a few drink tickets, because I think he could tell I wasn't really up for crowds at the time, which was great.The name of the game here is large parties.  You can tell this is their main type of business in every aspect of the way they operate this restaurant - from bussing the tables, to seating large parties, to taking the drink order, to getting food out in time - it might as well be a banquet facility.  But this was much appreciated, as they were able to accommodate our birthday party of 17 and keep service essentially seamless throughout the entire length of our meal.The bottomless drinks were truly never empty.  The food was really good and the server was helpful in selecting the right dish for my dietary restrictions.  They were helpful in settling up at the end as well, as I'm always the one who ends up doing the math.  :)  Overall, if you know what you're getting yourself into, this is a great place for a large party.  Would not come back otherwise.",0,0,0,Lauren S.,"Brooklyn, NY",304,133,219

3.0,3/3/2019,"Came here for my cousins birthday brunch. Super hard to find free parking nearby so be prepared to feed the meter. Once inside you get id checked. My cousin and her friends were waiting at the bar since they will not sit an incomplete party. We were quickly seated though once everyone made it. We had one of the most wobbly tables and ended up spilling a drink since it rocked so much if you leaned over on it to hear the person in front of you talking... music was super loud, even the waiter couldn't hear our orders. I get it was a party brunch day but maybe a few decibles lower would've been ok. Finally, someone fixed the wobbly table problem by sticking a napkin under and finally we were stable to eat. I ordered an omlette with spinach, cheese, baconnl, and fries on the side. It was delicious! One of the best omlettes I've had as they really stuffed it with spinach and bacon bits too.

Now, I'm not a God fearing person, but in moments of darkness, I need someone to help me numb the pain. My man Mo was there to make sure that no glass was empty and he kept it real with the recos.

5.0,2/17/2019,My first time to visit New York and a friend guided us to this restaurant.  The ambience was very stylish and chic.  I enjoyed a cocktail called Mango lava accompanied with the Essex Potato Pancake appetizer.  Our waiter was gracious and delivered all that we asked as well as notifying us that the kitchen would be closed to the hour.  We arrived bit late.,0,0,0,Charmiane R.,"Colton, CA",275,17,30
3.0,2/17/2019,"The waiter actually cut our amount of time for brunch. We were seated at 2:22 and drinks were stopped at 3pm. We all felt completely rushed as he never informed us how long the mimosa time was (an hour and a half), and when I brought it up to him he had no proper explanation. Usually I really enjoy Essex, but the server was extremely disappointing. We picked this particular spot because of the hour and a half mimosa, and we feel as though we were jipped. Although the food was good, there is no reason the server should have cut our time off because it was not crowded and, well, we paid for an hour and a half.",0,0,0,Janae C.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",4,15,9
2.0,2/17/2019,We planned a 40 person brunch over a month in advance and wanted a private area. The day before they call us saying that we can no longer have the private area because we then would have to hit a 2k minimum (which we easily did) but they originally told us it was a 1500 minimum. The top area is suppose to hold 50 people. We get up there and there's already a 20 top sitting up there. How are we fitting 40 more people in this area? They continued to argue with us that there was 41 table settings and we should've had more than enough room. We were all squeezed so tightly together that people had to stand on chairs to get out and use the bathroom. No one could move.We asked for extra tables multiple times it took over an hour of fighting to get that for us. I would never do brunch here again and every single person that we were with said the same thing. Overall just a terrible experience. Only good thing was the food. They also charged us for more people than we had in our group. Never again,0,0,0,Kaitlyn W.,"Staten Island, NY",210,6,1

2.0,2/10/2019,"I came here for a boozy brunch with a few of my friends hearing great things about this place but it was sub par compared to other brunch spots. The food was average nothing special, it was WAY too loud (I get its a ""fun"" brunch spot but I literally couldn't hear my own thoughts) , and the staff was extremely rude and kept rushing us (honestly this is probably what made the experience much worse). The only plus is that the mimosas were good. Other than that would probably never come back here.",0,0,0,Sheena K.,"New York, NY",331,106,133
4.0,2/8/2019,"The food here was very good and had plenty of vegetarian options which was nice, and they even had a vegan scramble! I'm used to eat subpar food when I do bottomless brunch, so Essex was very refreshing. They also had some ""different"" brunch options like potato pancakes with smoked salmon - I LOVED it! The servers were very attentive and kept our glasses full the entire time. The only thing that kind of rubbed me the wrong way was that they were rushing us a bit. We very little time to go over the menu before the server insisted on putting our orders in and since we were seated late, we had to get up from the table before our 90 minutes were over and were given drink tickets for the bar. I didn't mind, and I get that they have to turn the table over for the next party but it threw me off a bit. Making it feel less rushed would make this a 5 star review for me since the food was so delicious and the wait staff was incredibly attentive!",1,0,1,Gab D.,"New York, NY",253,38,0
5.0,2/2/2019,"I'm a fan!Everything about my experience with this place was great. We arrived around 1:30 for our 1:45 reservation--because one of my friends was fashionable late, and you need to have your entire party in order to be seated, my buddy and I waited by the bar area. The downstairs area, is moreso for large groups, I noticed.Finally, we made our way upstairs and the fun began. Within a few minutes of being seated the mimosas started flowing, the staff did an excellent job of coming over constantly to make sure our cups were all filled up. You have a choice of an entree and 90 minutes of unlimited mimosas for $36 ($4 extra for the steak and egg entree. They offer mimosas, screwdrivers and Bloody Mary-- you are allowed to switch drinks, for example, you can start with mimosas, and end with screwdrivers.The food was excellent along with the service. I went with the steak and eggs which comes with home fries. I want to say these are the most seasoned home fries I've ever had, they are excellent! The steak was ok, but I won't say it blew me away. I ordered a side of grits, and was equally as happy. My other friend ordered the exact same meal as I did, he too enjoyed his meal. My other friend she had the shrimp and grits and loved her meal, too. Lastly, we orders the coconut cake-- it wasn't so good, but that's fine, everything can't be perfect. Toward the end the waitress came over twice to remind us they needed the table. Typically that can rub you the wrong way, but she reminded us that they needed the table for others who had a reservation. She wasn't rude about it, and we completely understood. She even offered us a drink for us as we headed downstairs and told us we could still hang out by the bar downstairs.Overall, I was very impressed and believe I will now have my birthday brunch here, in March. Definitely would recommend for small groups, large groups, they seem to be able to accommodate all.",4,1,8,Jason R.,"Brooklyn, NY",400,480,1763

4.0,2/1/2019,"Note: this review is based on the restaurant week menu. I started off with the braised short rib. Listen, I could've eaten that as my entree! The ribs were so tender and flavorful, the potatoes were buttery and great. My friend had the oysters and killed them all. Next we had the lobster ravioli and the steak frites. The lobster ravioli was good. The lobster was placed on top of the ravioli which I had never seen but I actually liked. The frites were okay during, but my friend raved about them the day after. Take that as you may. We both had the Honey Pot cocktail and it was strong, but sweet. It has a kick for sure. Overall would I come back? Yup! Would i recommend it to others?

Our server, Kayleigh, was excellent the whole time - she checked in a fair amount but was not over bearing. My mimosa glass was NEVER empty. The second I neared the bottom, I blinked and it was refilled. At the end, Kayleigh listed the amount per person for those who drank and the amount per person for those who didn't drink. She told us how much tax and gratuity were as well.

5.0,1/22/2019,"TLDR: Great, chill restaurant that I've enjoyed for over 10 years. Great dinner and generous happy hour! Overall rating: AI've been here so many times already. I'm still not sick of it yet! See my previous review for a more detailed review of the restaurant. FYI, some of the prices are higher than listed online. Here's what my friend and I tried this time using a Pulsd:-MANCHEGO MACARONI & CHEESE: So creamy and good! Not too salty. Just wish there were more breadcrumbs on top. Generous portion that's big enough for 2 people to share! A+-AUSTRALIAN LAMB CHOPS served with potato lasagna and beet crisps: 3 delicious fatty pieces of lamb chops served medium rare as requested were fantastic! The potato lasagna and beet crisps really brought this dish down. The potato lasagna tasted very bland. It seemed only like layers of boiled potatoes and bad tomato sauce. I took 2 bites and gave up. Not worth the calories. The beet crisps were good in flavor but were very soggy. There were also random 2 pieces of roasted peppers that tasted like they were from a jar. Try to get them to swap to different sides if possible! The lamb was an A but the sides were a D! -HOUSE-MADE GNOCCHI WITH SHRIMP served with light tomato cream sauce: Still as good as last time. Though the gnocchi wasn't as crispy this time. A--PEANUT BUTTER ""SIGH"" PIE a la mode: Finally got to try this while it was fresh! REALLY great peanut butter pie! Not too sweet. The crust was actually made of crushed peanut butter cookies I think! Served with sliced strawberries. We got it with vanilla ice cream, which was their only ice cream flavor of the night. A++-BLOOD ORANGE APEROL SPRITZ cocktail: Still as amazing as last time! I got 2 of these babies! A+ -GINGER SNAP cocktail (gin, muddled ginger, fresh lemon): Good if you like ginger and gin. I'm not a fan of the latter. But my friend loved it. B+-JACK STRAW MARTINI cocktail (Jack Daniels, muddled strawberries, chartreuse, lemon): Not a fan of Jack Daniels, but everything else was amazing! I'd love to get this with rum instead over ice next time! A-My 2 minor complaints:-The large group in the center of the main room was SO LOUD and made it hard to talk! The restaurant was mostly empty on Monday at 7pm. -DEAR GOD WHY DO THEY ONLY HAVE *COLD* WATER IN THE BATHROOM?! Makes washing your hands feel like a punishment, especially in the winter.

The zucchini noodles and bolognese-like sauce were so flavorful.  The chicken looked great too.  I think a few people who got the steak said it was a little overdone, so maybe ask for it cooked a bit rarer than you actually want.  We had one waitress serving all of us, and she did a wonderful job.  She must have been so overwhelmed because we were a large group (with an open bar that we were making great use of), so we were keeping her quite busy.  But she kept it together!  We had the whole upstairs part of the restaurant to ourselves, which was nice because of our group size (and we were pretty loud).  The ambiance of the restaurant is nice.  Aside from the tuna, the food was solid and the service was great.  Great for a large group!",0,0,0,Dori A.,"New York, NY",2,63,66

Throughout the night we received our food however the cocktails were quite slow - but it was happy hour so I get it. Our group was having an intense conversation about a book we've read and we're genuinely enjoying our time at Essex.During the conversation, a man from a neighboring table approached us rather rudely and contemptuously to state we were too loud. Our table responded that the entire venue was loud and that they should perhaps move because we arrived first. Unfortunately another group piggybacked the comment but with a racial undertone.  Words were spewed and we continued with our conversations.  Now, none of the above actions were at any fault of the restaurant HOWEVER our waitress stopped serving our table to accommodate the tables with the crude behavior towards us! I mean she just STOPPED.  BLATANTLY IGNORED US FOR AT LEAST 20 - 30 minutes! We had to flag her down just to get a dessert menu. Once the groups left, our service was resumed as it was when we walked in - but I was too late for redemption.  Our group felt this act from the wait staff as well as the manager was insensitive and reflected poorly on their customer services skills.",0,1,0,Natalie G.,"Rosedale, NY",104,37,22

We had 2 people join our table toward the end, and the servers were very nice about accommodating them. We were nearing the end of our bottomless brunch time, and the servers asked if we could head downstairs so they could make room for another big party coming in. In exchange, they gave us another round of drinks downstairs, which was thoughtful.

You'll hardly have to look for a refill because they'll be right there refilling! They're so fast and on point. The kitchen was a little slow but I'm sure it was due to such a large crowd. Brunch was jumping for New Year's Day. Food was deff worth the wait. They offer large portions too. Lobster mac n cheese was the best item on the menu. There is a lot of lobster on it too.

3.0,12/21/2018,"This place is sooo average for NYC brunch. Overcrowded, loud and busy, and overall underwhelming for all the hype. My sister and I shared the chicken fried steak with gravy, biscuits; and sausage. Was extremely bland and kept having to add tobasco to give it more flavor. Could have probably had a better version of this at Denny's for half the price. I gave this restaurant 3 stars because the other food items looked pretty appetizing, and the bottomless mimosa experience was pretty cool.

The burger was cooked just right but it wasn't anything special. The fries were super greasy. The scallops were disappointing. It was extremely salty and not fresh. The risotto was loaded with butter. For drinks we had ginger snap cocktail and fresh watermelon martini. I also tried the champagne but it tasted funky. The cocktails however were delicious and strong! I highly recommend the watermelon martini. They use real watermelon which is a plussss in my books. Service was okay but I would return again.

4.0,12/16/2018,"Visited here last night for a girlfriend's birthday - party of about ~30!We selected the pre-fixe dinner menu which included an appetizer, a dinner entree, and 2 hour unlimited pitchers of margaritas (regular, mango, and jalopeno - my fave! A bit of a kick and not overly sweet), mojitos, sangria, beer, wine, and champagne. Note: the 2 hour limit is strictly enforced so drink up!!!One of my friends and I decided to share everything we ordered which turned out to be a sweet deal for both of us :)We ordered the seared ahi tuna and steamed icy blue mussels to start. The tuna was so buttery and had a great flavor to it. The mussels, however, stole the show. A generous portion of mussels in a light buttery, garlic, white wine sauce served with bread to dip. So delicious!!! Literally wanted to lick the bowl clean.For dinner we ordered the gulf shrimp risotto and prime NY strip steak which came with potatoes, crispy onions, and asparagus. The risotto was creamy, yet light at the same time and the garlic shrimp were delish. The steak was cooked sooo perfectly and had such great flavor!!! I was very content with our choices.I am ALWAYS apprehensive about cliché boozy brunch spots and pre-fixed menus because I feel restaurants often skimp out on the quality of the food. But, Essex on Rivington truly blew my expectations out of the water! Came out to $84 with tip and tax but considering we had a great buzz after our delicious meal, we had no complaints!

5.0,11/5/2018,"Restaurants vary depending on what day of the week you go. When you go during a crowded brunch anywhere in NYC, you're going in with the expectation of understaffed servers who are overwhelmed. I recommend you give Essex a try on a weekday evening because their brunch is not worth it. I went once for their bottomless brunch once. An average burger, drinks, and substandard service cost me $35 and I would not recommend it to any one for brunch. Yet, I give Essex a 5 stars because this is one of my go-to spots for after work drinks! I always end up back at Essex.On weekdays, they've got happy hour where drinks are $5-8, amazing oysters $1, and on Wednesday's they serve lobster for $20 with french in limited quantities. We loveee their drinks and oysters. My favorite is their jalapeño cocktail. They've also got a garlic herb butter mussel dish that is soooo delicious and aromatic, and a juicy steak for dinner. A nice dinner and drinks comes out to less than $50. Or you could do appetizers and drinks and it'll be ~$30+ based on what your liver decides that day. 10/10 would recommend!

They hardly let the mimosa fall below half a glass before they came by to refill. Love this! The food selection is decent and filled with many tasty sounding dishes. I was torn between the classic French toast, biscuits and gravy or steak and eggs. After much debate, I settled on the steak and eggs which did not disappoint (see photo). The steak had great flavor, they cooked it perfect and the eggs were fluffy! I sampled off the plates of my fellow ""brunchers"" and everything else was just as good. This is definitely a good brunch spot to visit if your looking for a quick bite and have other spots to hit up after. They are busy so it's understandable that they tend to rush the tables.

They also had soy milk, which was nice for coffee.The entree selection was more than I'm use to when it comes to gluten free options, so having more to choose from than just what I want in an omelette was pretty nice. Settled on the eggs Benedict over gluten free arepas with salmon gravlax. The entree came out warm bordering on cold. I wasn't particularly thrilled about that.

With that being said, this is not the place for me. I came here for a birthday brunch, and although I am happy the birthday girl had a good time, this will be the last time I go to a boozy brunch. Essex is in an under decorated industrial space. It looks like a no frills club. When you first come in, you are assaulted by the amount of people drinking, and talking loudly over equally loud music. Because our party was so big, we were brought upstairs to a separate area. The furniture is super dated and well used. We all had to get the $45 brunch, so know that you really don't have a choice if your not a big drinker. Your drink choices are mimosas, screw drivers, and bloody mary's. They immediately serve you a mimosa if you do not tell them otherwise. I stuck with the mimosa as it seemed like the safest choice. They use tropicana orange juice so its nothing fancy. The servers are super diligent about keeping your glass full. If your half way finished, they will top you off. Water on the other hand was a struggle to get. I got the aristocrat, which potato pancakes, topped with salmon gravlax, salmon roe, sour cream and two poached eggs. Although it was good, it was very salty for my taste. After your done with your food, you just drink some more!

Then they sat us upstairs in a corner (which is fine) at a table definitely meant for 2 people (there were 3 of us - not fine). The space was cool - they have a bar and some seating downstairs and also some seating upstairs, it looks like you can book some of the separate spaces for a larger party.

It's now 10 and we had our appetizers (mine was the kale Caesar- nothing to write home about, it was just fine.) the food is still not out.At this point I ask to speak to a manager. He is extremely rude and YELLS at me and my friend. He tells us that we don't know what we're talking about and there was issues on the kitchen. We received our food at....11:00 PM. By this point the restaurant is empty. The manager then sends us a ""round of shots"" as an apology- we did not need more alcohol after the two hour open bar, we needed our food.The chicken in green curry was a very weird flavor- it seemed like it was trying to be Asian curry but done completely incorrectly. It was sweet, the chicken was really chewy...overall a 2 Star dish in my opinion. 0 stars for service, 0 for experience, 2 for food. If I could give 0 stars I would.

The service was attentive and the waiter always made sure our mimosa glasses were full. Also, the playlist was so fun (pop 2k, disney soundtracks, rap) and it was so easy to make a reservation on a Sunday. Can't wait to go back for my birthday!

1.0,7/31/2018,"Came here for dinner with my friend around 6 and was already put off by the extremely loud atmosphere. I guess there were 2 birthday parties here at the same time. We were quickly seated at a dirty table and given menus. The menu options sounded so good on paper and the happy hour offers were enticing. We settled on the NY strip steak, lamb chops, braised short rib, and ahi tuna poke appetizer. While we were waiting for our food, we went to wash our hands in the bathroom. BIG MISTAKE. As soon as I entered the bathroom, I was hit by a wave of hot garbage vomit smell. It was disgusting and I almost threw up. I bolted out of there and sat down only to see the host grab a folded napkin off a table, wipe the wet table off, and place it back on the table. A family of 6 was then seated at that table 10 minutes later. Later on, an employee left a windex bottle ON TOP OF THE ""CLEAN"" SILVERWARE.The food came out quickly but my appetizer was cold and the polenta was stiff and rubbery. It looked like it had been microwaved and left sitting until the short rib, which was more fat than actual meat, was thrown on top. The taste was fine but it should've been hotter. The tuna poke was salty and nothing spectacular. The steak and the asparagus that came with it were heavily salted as well. I needed to drink 6 glasses of water. The lamb chops were the only decent dish. Dessert was average. If you're looking for a place to have a nice dinner, Essex is definitely not it. The service is slow, the place is dirty and the food is coated in salt. I will not be coming back.",2,0,0,April J.,"Orange, CT",1,4,9

The music is incredibly loud, so don't plan on talking with people that you can't shout at next to you. Food took an incredible amount of time... some tables clapped when their food was finally served. The waitress actually got mad at us asking for mimosa refills. Somehow ended up being $58 per person by the end. I'll give it two stars only because my pancakes were decent. I can see why it's so busy.

We got the unlimited drinks (bloody's, mimosas, and screwdrivers) with an entree for $35. The drinks were strong...okay taste. So if you're looking to get buzzed you won't be disappointed. If you're looking for a good tasting drink though...meh. I got the Benedict with salmon. It was pretty good. Didn't blow me away or anything. The Hollandaise gave a nice amount of creaminess to the dish but unfortunately overpowered the salmon at the same time. Home fries were home fries...nothing to really set them apart.

I chose to do the premium open bar which is $85 and I specifically asked for a separate check from the group because everyone else chose the regular open bar ($65). I left a 20% tip so if you do the math I should have been charged $102. INSTEAD, I was overcharged. A few weeks later, while checking my statement, I see that I was over charged $94 on my credit card so I called the restaurant and spoke to a nice man who said he would take care of it as he noticed that the $94 should have been charged on the OTHER card.It's been over 1.5 months and it's still not fixed.

Thankfully we made it just in time before Happy Hour ended, which included $1 oysters and half off drinks. The waitress was very attentive, she came over to make sure we all put in our orders before happy hour ended.

We were seated upstairs around a u shaped large table. The menu we were given was the boozy brunch although I wasn't partaking in that. We were given complimentary onion bread and butter. I could've done without it: the bread was cold, like it just came from the fridge. Anyway I ordered the avocado toast and it was not special. It had bacon on it and came with two poached eggs. The avocado had a tad bit too much lime in it. There were cherry tomatoes decorating the plate with some sesame seeds. It was just ok. My other friends did the boozy brunch and the refill rate was pretty short which they liked. I tried my friends French toast and it was worse than the avocado toast. It was incredibly sweet with an overpowering taste of cinnamon. And came with this banana paste that was I guess banana with alcohol in it/I don't know what to call it- but it was a miss.

We had the lava cake, which was alright but you can get a better one at Chilis-When we ordered our wine, we were told that they needed to check to see if they had any available. Who doesn't​ have rosé in NYC in the summer? There was only one rosé option on the menu, it's not like we were asking for something unusual! Pros:-We came in on a Friday night for dinner around 7pm and were probably one of 3 tables in the place during the whole 2-hour time period we were there-The portions are huge.

We really wanted oysters and were so so excited for this place's happy hour. We were seated right away and ordered a dozen oysters.The oysters came out in kind of a careless heap with some oysters falling out of their shells and other oysters having no liquid inside their shells. After we had our first oyster, my boyfriend and I both exchanged a look of confusion with each other. The oysters tasted like NOTHING. No brine, no sweetness, not even any fishiness. They literally just tasted like water. We thought maybe we had each just gotten flukes and ate a couple more and they were exactly the same. My boyfriend mentioned that they tasted as if the kitchen rinsed them before serving them so we asked a waitress to ask the kitchen if they did and, sure enough, the kitchen rinses their oysters. If you like oysters and eat them often, you probably know that this is not normal. Oysters are normally just shucked and served as is with the oyster liquor to preserve all that delicious oyster flavor. If our experience at Essex had stopped here, I would be giving this place 1 star. However, after expressing my deep dissatisfaction to our server, she gave us 6 more (not rinsed!) oysters completely on the house and took half the price of the oysters off our bill, telling us ""you shouldn't be paying for what you don't enjoy."" tl;dr if you are getting oysters, specifically ask your waiter to tell the kitchen not to rinse them and you can expect great service at this restaurant.",2,1,1,Miri K.,"Ann Arbor, MI",217,9,2

In addition to an entree, brunch includes your choice of bottomless mimosas, screwdrivers, bloody Mary's, or all three (brunch drinks are interchangeable).Anytime I see lobster added to a classic dish, I'm sold. I've had both the lobster eggs Benedict and the lobster mac and cheese. Essex does not skimp with the lobster either; both plates came with a healthy serving. The lobster mac was particularly delicious. I'm always skeptical of any mac that isn't home cooked, but this one did not disappoint.I can't sing enough praises about the service at Essex. They are extremely accommodating. Essex also is great for large groups. After waiting almost three hours for a table at another restaurant, I called Essex for a last minute table for 12.

1.0,3/28/2018,"Came here with my mother for dinner a few weeks ago on a Saturday night. Easy to get a reservation, although we still had to wait for about 15 minutes when we showed up on time. The atmosphere upstairs was... weird. Small and cramped with very uncomfortable chairs. It took about 10 minutes for them to take our drink order, and another 20 minutes to receive said drinks. We actually received our appetizer BEFORE our drinks, which was very awkward.Furthermore, we have a food allergy to wheat and ordered simple mussels. For some reason they brought them to us with a GIANT loaf of bread stuck in the plate, none of which was mentioned on the menu. BIG no-no. Had to send it back for a new one, very wasteful. The mussels are DELICIOUS, though. Best thing we ate there.Main course was mediocre, with my steak much smaller than anticipated and cooked much less than what I ordered. Had to send the first one back because they added mashed potatoes, which I specified I was also allergic to and apparently that got lost in translation. All in all, you should never have to send more than one order back, but this place clearly isn't meant to have good food. We hated the vibe because we aren't 25 year olds living off their parent's money, so definitely won't go here again.",1,0,0,Kelly M.,"Eastford, CT",0,5,0

The music was good some of the time (hip hop, top 40) but then had us going ""huh???"" When they played britney spears and Celine Dion. Not exactly happening brunch vibes. Our waiter was nice and attentive and we didn't have to wait long for our food. I had the Mexican scramble and my friend had an eggs Benedict. Both plates were okay but nothing to rave about however that is to be expected at a place that focuses more on getting their patrons drunk than fine dining.

2.0,3/4/2018,"So! On Sunday Feb. 25th, a group of friends and I went to this establishment to celebrate 2 birthdays. Our reservation was for 3pm. We've all arrived on time but our table wasn't ready. At 3:20, our table still want ready and the hostess Celine was apologetic and was gracious enough to give us complimentary drinks tickets while we wait. At 3:45, finally sat down and commenced our Brunch. The vibe was great, with a dj playing good music and hits. After brunch, (3hrs later) and a bill of roughly $900, our section in the back was pretty much empty. We then proceeded to take pictures to end a great day. Derrick the ""Brunch Manager"" comes out of pocket a bit aggressive and says ""This is your last picture and you have to leave, as 2 people complained and left"". Now this is a place that is very loud and has a dj. Of course we were upset as again our bill was about $900!!. The hostess (Celine) felt embarrassed and again was deeply apologetic including the bouncer whom was also sympathetic. We then found out Derrick the ""Brunch Manager"" lied and pretty much just wanted us to leave. He wanted to apologize and offer us free shots.  (Apology not accepted, but of course the shots were). This was our first time at this establishment, and sadly to say it will be our last.

3.0,3/2/2018,"What a whirlwind. We definitely weren't prepared for what we walked into for boozy brunch, but then again I'm not sure how you can adequately prepare for such. Regardless, if you're looking for a boozy brunch, this is the place to go.They have a few different seatings, 1:30, 3:00 and you get 1.5-3 hours of unlimited booze for about $40. We got there at 3;00, and weren't seated for  about 30 minutes, but they started our boozy brunch right away. They were very generous with refilling our booze, too generous, we got hammered. The food options are actually pretty decent with a handful of breakfast, brunch, lunch options. I got the mac n cheese which came with bacon and a salad.. and it was just okay. Lets be real, the real reason you go here is for the boozy brunch. The atmosphere was 5/5- it feels like your in an old factory, with a long line of windows, beautiful exposed brick everywhere, some of the old contraptions of a  factory. It has multi level seating with 2 large lofts with seating that overlook the main dining. It's funky, fun, and lively. The music is lively, bumping, very loud, almost feels like your in a club. Actually, it feels like your in a day club, raging. I guess you kind of are. There's funky pictures, gifs on the wall... quite the scene.

3.0,2/12/2018,"TLDR: come for the mood, not for the food; multi-level boozy brunch spot in the LES; good service; below average foodCame here on a Sunday at 1:30pm in a group of 7 for my roommate's birthday. She had made reservations well in advance. By NYC standards, this place was pretty large, with two levels and a high ceiling, open space concept. We were seated at a table on the second floor right by the bar (ideal spot for getting drink and water refills). Our waiter immediately came by to start taking our drink orders (bottomless with choice of screwdriver, mimosa, or bloody mary with the option to switch between them) as well as bring us bread. Although the bread initially looked and smelled really good, it unfortunately reminded me of a mediocre garlic bagel. I only had mimosas out of the drink options and found them to be fine, but my friends described the bloody mary as watered down (the tomato juice wasn't thick enough), having too much vodka, and not spicy enough.For my main entree, I ordered the southern (chicken-fried steak, sausage patty, two eggs, sausage gravy, and biscuit) with the eggs cooked over easy. I was pretty disappointed when my dish arrived and the eggs were cooked completely through. Furthermore, the chicken-fried steak lacked flavor (tasted mostly of oil mixed with meat), the sausage patty reminded me of what you'd typically get at McDonald's, and the biscuit was mealy and bland. My friends ordered a variety of different dishes and had similar sentiments about the food (i.e. one friend described the aristocrat as tasting too fishy, another friend said the veggie burger could use more texture, and a third friend described her dish as a ""solid three stars"").While the food here was no doubt in my mind below average, I did enjoy the lively atmosphere and good music (top 40, dance). Our servers were also great and kept refilling our drinks well past the 1.5 hour bottomless limit. If you're looking for a great meal, definitely opt for one of the many other brunch spots in the LES. However, if you're just looking for a somewhat affordable bottomless brunch place with good vibes, Essex might be worth checking out.",2,2,0,Amanda W.,"London, United Kingdom",242,96,259
2.0,2/11/2018,"The service was absolutely horrible from start to finish. Walked in assuming I would be seated for a friend's brunch (which had begun 10 minutes prior) but I was told I had to wait for the whole party to arrive. When asking the hostess if we could be seated with 1/2+ of the party present, I was then told that the table wasn't even ready for us yet. Finally after a 20+ minute delay we were seated. The table was quite cramped for a large party, and the waiter rushed us along, barely even giving us the full 3 hour bottomless brunch that was promised. Waiter also barely refilled our drinks, and when he did, he would only fill with mimosas (but the brunch included bloodys and screwdrivers as well). Those who did order the other included drinks were never offered refills. Instead, they had to wave over a server (who most of the time was not even our waiter) for refills. Also no ice water was provided or even offered at any point during the brunch. Because the waiter was barely present, I had to go downstairs to the bar and bring up several ice waters for friends. Staff also tried to accuse us of underpaying, when we indeed paid, and were overcharged for an extra meal. At that point, the brunch had only been going on for two hours, and we were rushed out well before the 3 hour mark. However, the food was very good. That's the only reason I'm giving it 2 stars.

4.0,1/24/2018,"Let's face it, the main reason people make a weekend reservation to this place is for the bottomless brunch. In total with our entree we spent about $50/ person. This was including mimosas, bloodies, and screwdrivers. You can also interchange between these three throughout your meal if you get sick of one. The service is great they are very attentive to your glass. The mimosas are already made and they go around with pitchers and when I say you will not see the bottom of your glass I mean it. So the bottomless is definitely worth it if you are trying to get your day going. The waitress was also nice enough to get a group picture of our table and she was very happy to take it. As far as the food goes there is a good selection. Everyone was satisfied with the portion size of the meal. The food is ok but it is not amazing which is to be expected with a place like this.

4.0,1/16/2018,Our group of five enjoyed dinner on Saturday night.  The restaurant has a strange setup with several different dinner zones but I think this adds privacy and uniqueness to your dining experience.  The bar area can get loud so being removed from it allows you to enjoy your dinner conversations.  The dinner lighting areas are dark so you can't really see and appreciate and critique your food because you can't really see it.THe food was excellent and the staff was excellent. We did come early so we had no competition for our attention. I would strongly recommend the sliders with short ribs.  You get three and unfortunately I agreed to share them before I tasted them.

2.0,12/30/2017,"I hate to have to leave this review because the food was actually decent - but service and ambience were both seriously lacking and after the treatment we just got from the manager, definitely will not be returning. First off, the music is entirely too loud. When the place is packed (which I suspect it usually is given the trendiness of the crowd) it's impossible to talk to other people in your party without shouting. That being said, I do not recommend bringing anyone older who may be looking for a relaxing brunch, and certainly no one with hearing problems. After an abysmally long wait for our food, everything arrived room temperature at best. Which means our food was sitting somewhere while our waitress was god knows where - she disappeared frequently during our meal so unfortunately I'm not surprised. I had the challah french toast which was very sweet and tasty - would have been better hot. Everything would have been fine (not great, but ok)....then the check came. We were paying cash and had exact change (no splitting the bill drama, hallelujah)! The waitress tells us, with zero apology for the inconvenience, they don't ""deal with coins."" Pretty sure that's illegal, but my friend says, ok and puts another $1 on the pile to cover the extra. As we're waiting we then start to think out loud, but they're still going to have to bring us change for the $1 what a dumb policy! No folks, instead what they do is...keep your change! Granted it was only $0.29 we were out but if you do the math over hundreds, maybe thousands of tables they're pocketing a decent amount of ""unclaimed"" cash and are completely unapologetic about it. The waitress said nothing to us about keeping the change and disappeared after dropping off the check without even a thanks. We complained to the bartender who then called the manager and HIS response was ""I would assume you'd just leave that as a tip but if you really need the $0.29 I can get it for you."" I'm no language expert but definitely didn't detect an apology anywhere in there....unless that's a-hole for ""I'm sorry."" Shrugs. You just lost three customers over $0.29 Essex.

We were a party of nine and dined in the afternoon.Here's what you need to know about Essex:1. Great service. Our mimosas were always topped off (which makes it easy to lose count... so be prepared) and the servers were accommodating to our questions. 2. Vibes are typical LES NYC brunch. This spot is an institution for a reason.3. Relatively extensive menu. There are options for everyone here. Vegetarian, vegan, everyone will be happy here.4. So here is the rub: the food... is bland and overprice. I got the Southern Brunch and ended up smothering it in hot sauce, and it was still plain. AND IT WAS COLD. I didn't have the heart to make a big deal out of it, especially it was my friend's birthday. But paying about $50 for brunch and to have it be that level of quality? Not okay.While the mimosas are delicious and strong, it doesn't overcome the overpriced and less-than-mediocre food. I wouldn't come back on my own, only if someone threw a birthday party here.

It is the perfect bottomless brunch place if you are looking to go somewhere with a large group (can book a party up to 50 people) or celebrate a birthday.  The restaurant's vibe is just as good as it's food.  It is located in an old warehouse with loft-like space.  The music is fun and just makes you want to get up and dance while you sip on your mimosa or breakfast cocktail of choice.  Don't expect to go to Essex for a quiet and cozy dinner or brunch, the music is loud and the place is usually packed with people, making it not the best place to have an intimate conversation.  Also, Essex is more of a younger scene, so the environment is rambunctious.I went to Essex with a big group of my friend's for a bottomless birthday brunch and it was the perfect place to start our festivities.  For about 32$, it is one of the most bang for your buck bottomless brunches I have ever been to. 10/10 would definitely recommend.",0,0,0,Simone B.,"Queens, NY",360,30,71

The food honestly wasn't that memorable and came at a steep price, especially if you are looking to do the bottomless brunch (~$35 total). The drinks are poured heavy and strong, they will %$@# you up. But be on time. They are strict about the time you have at your table, so they will make sure you get your drink on in that time but also leave the table before it happens. The thing I liked most about this restaurant was the layout. The natural light was great and provided a positive energy throughout the venue.

I ordered egg-whites with fruit and potatoes. Seriously how do you mess up eggs? I guess they were just sitting all morning. Also the fruit was sour and wilted over a bed of lettuce. I sent this back and got the banana and chocolate pancakes which were actually really good and filling. The waitress was really nice and accommodated all of our requests.  The place itself is very nice inside with two levels. The decor on the wall however was very dusty lol.

However, my experience there yesterday (10/22/2017) was so unsettling and disappointing that I felt it necessary to come here to write a review. The wait staff was great. However, the music was quite subpar. In fact, many of us upstairs sort of bonded across tables as we painfully reacted to awful song after song. We asked our waiter to speak to the manager or the DJ to perhaps get a more representative music selection. Our waiter spoke with the DJ, and returned to let us know that the DJ didn't seem to be taking requests. We then asked to speak with the manager, and the waiter informed us that the DJ is the manager. So I spoke with the manager myself. I asked if we could have any music from the 2000s onward, specifically any R&B or hip-hop selections. The manager replied ""It's absolutely not happening."" I said part of the appeal of this place is that the music is so good. There's good food and bottomless drinks all over the city. The manager replied, ""I don't care."" Honestly, if a manager can flat out say to recurring and paying customers, ""I don't care,"" then it's important that future customers who may be visiting this place for similar reasons be aware of my experience and the fact that the manager simply doesn't care.

3.0,10/3/2017,Essex is located in the rapidly gentrifying LES (Lower East Side) and definitely tries to capitalize on the areas newly minted Yuppie class looking for lots of booze. The décor and general feel of the establishment is that of the cool and hip direction this neighborhood is taking. We were there with a large party and decided to go for the $65 pre-fix and all you can drink dinner. This is fantastic in theory for a group. They were NOT stingy with the drinks or the brands offered. This was the highlight of the event as I feel I probably drank my money's worth in alcohol easily. However the downside is the food. While the descriptions on the menu seem tasty the execution and overall quality was lacking severely. It was great for a group outing but next time I feel like I might just skip the food entirely and merely drink my dinner.,2,0,1,Theodore H.,"Jersey City, NJ",95,121,209

This wouldn't normally bother me so much, but we were sat at a table right next to her and she was basically just leaning on our booth throughout our entire meal.

I was completely blown away and kind of wish I didn't give her what I originally had. I'd probably go elsewhere for a party brunch experience, especially since the staff is greedy and the food missed the mark completely.

We have been to other bottomless brunch places and yes, you often sacrifice food quality for unlimited drinks. However HERE the food is literally inedible. My friend just left her entire plate. Not only that but the vibe isn't nice. It feels really cheap and the sound echoes off the wall. People were wearing flip flops and felt so casual.. in a bad way.

4.0,6/2/2017,"What draws people here is the enticing $42 bottomless brunch. We were a party of 23 with a 3:30 resi. About 10 of us promptly showed up around 3:20 for the reservation. The hostess was nowhere to be found. After making my way deeper into the restaurant, I saw a man with an iPad, seating other patrons. I walked up to him and announced myself. He said that he would sit us in a few minutes, as we were slightly early and that some tables were going to be available very shortly. 3:20, 3:30, 3:45. Still not seated and more and more of us are starting to show up. Went back to check with the host and he said just a few more minutes. He said, if he had to guess it would be another 10 minutes.4:00, we make eye contact and he comes over to me and hands me a stack of free drink tickets as an apology for making us wait this long for our table (nice gesture). He also said that we will be seated any minute now.4:10, The host tells us to follow him because our table was finally ready. As we're heading to the table, he apologized again for the long wait and said that he would take 20% off our bill for the long inconvenience.The good thing about the location of our table was that it was lofted above the restaurant in a private, intimate section. Definitely a plus when your are with a large group and want to mingle with each other. The down side of this area, was the tight and awkward layout of the table. Some of the guests mentioned that they felt squooshed. As far as food and drink, Essex's menu packs enough options to fit anyone's taste buds. Many of us ordered the Lobster Eggs Benny and The Aristocrat. Both dishes were well received by the group. The flowing, bottomless booze of screw drivers, bloody Marys, and Memosas kept the party going.Overall it was a successful birthday brunch. The host definitely did the right thing by comping us a round of drinks while we waited for our table and by then knocking 20% off the bill. It showed that he was actually concerned that we were inconvenienced and wanted to do something about it.

5.0,5/26/2017,"Came here for brunch with my fiancé and some friends about month ago. We had reservations for 11:30 and waited only a few minutes. We had bottomless brunch and it definitely was bottomless. My fiancé and I along with some other friends had mimosas while some others had bloody Mary's. I'm pretty sure not once did any of us see the bottom of our glasses. The service was phenomenal. Our server was on hand every time our glasses reached half empty. The server even allowed us to switch up our drink choices and also gave us the option of bellinis which wasn't even on the menu. The food was just as good. I ordered a burger expecting a small beef patty, but when I got it, the patty was a good 1/2 lbs. My fiancé had the lox Benedict which she shared with me and it tasted just as great.

Natural light fills the space and the bartender wasn't shy about filling our mimosa glasses. Not even sure how much I had to drink but I know that it was enough for the brunch special to be worth it. The burger and fries I had weren't very memorable, but that may be on account of the unlimited mimosas. It was my first brunch outing and I had a good experience overall.

3.0,4/29/2017,"TL;DR: the $31 bottomless brunch undoubtedly draws people here.Like many other LES brunch spots, Essex is unabashedly trendy and survives on it. The promise of inexpensive bottomless mimosas/screwdrivers/Bloody Marys is what likely draws in crowds of yuppies (though more racially heterogeneous than other LES spots) which is how I found myself here on a Sunday morning. After waiting 2 million years in Brunch Time, a floating host led us to our seat by the kitchen, where we got a front row seat in seeing else's food come out except for ours. Onto the food and drinks. I did not get a bottomless deal bc I was not trying to ~turn up~ but I tried some of my friends'. Mimosa was really watered down, Bloody Mary was just way too strong and I don't think any of us wanted to know what their screwdriver was like. Food-wise, I had the eggs Benedict with kale which was ok. They had the smallest poached eggs known to man which were not runny in any way, on English muffins that seemed rather stale. My friend's cheesy grits looked amazing, though, as did the potato pancakes, but I'm vegetarian so neither of those were available to me bc they come with salmon or shrimp. So all in all, I don't think it'd be back unless i were trying to day drink and I suddenly started eating meat, though maybe the food is better when turnt.",1,2,1,Hui C.,"Manhattan, NY",326,291,131

My group was looking for more of a party brunch - this wasnt that however, the DJ played loud music which kept the atmosphere relatively upbeat and there were enough of us to stay entertained! The food was great! I just got the 3 eggs with bacon dish and it was more than enough! They gave you potatoes and salad with it. We did the bottomless and our drinks were flowing! Our waitress never let us have an empty glass, she was on top of it at all times. Highly recommend for brunch.

There's a bar and some seating downstairs and then a balcony area with seating. We sat on the balcony and was able to see everything that was happening downstairs. There is so much natural lighting coming in which makes for great selfies! The service there was impeccable also. Someone was running late and they allowed the group to place that persons food order so it would be ready with everyone else's. Not everywhere that offers bottomless does it correctly, but Essex does it RIGHT! Our waitress made sure not only that our glasses were never empty, but she even filled them all the way to the rim sometimes. The food was excellent across the board. I have the lobster benny (of course) and there was so much lobster and it was full of flavor. At the end of our time, our waitress let us know very politely that they had another group coming in and topped our mimosas off before letting us know we could hang by the bar. Win again! Although as people started to enter, the bar area became a little cramped because the pathway was small, we had a great time hanging there for another 1.5hours.

The drinks were flowing nonstop. The waiter made sure that we were not lacking in that department. The waiter was attentive and friendly throughout our stay. I'm so glad I found this spot.

4.0,2/28/2017,"I saw such great reviews for this place so I was excited to partake. I was a little late for our reservation but they were gracious enough to still accommodate after ten or so minutes. We were sat at a two-top right in front of the entrance/bathrooms and directly under where the upper area overlooks the lower area. Not a problem. We ordered our food and waited quite a long time. As a courtesy, our server, Jess, gave us a free plate of mixed fruit (without raspberries! We mentioned my friend was allergic and Jess made sure there were NO raspberries! Thank you!). When our food arrived, there was a very long hair on my friend's plate. It was sent back and a fresh plate came back to us. Nice. I ordered the aristocrat based off of glowing Yelp reviews and was kind of disappointed. It was anticlimactic and lacked flavor. My friend enjoyed her French toast but commented that the Bananas foster sauce for it was ladled on the plate in an unattractive way and she had wished it was on her French toast and that there was more of it. Food is okay. Service is better. Mimosas, on the other hand, were delicious, and I think that is the overall draw to this brunch spot. BUT THEN! Mid-meal, someone on the upper level got too tipsy and his entire drink fell on our table, basically ruining our meal. Thankfully, the manager gave us a discount on our overall bill. The service was great, the ambiance not so much. Lots of people talking over loud music, who were too-tipsy and obnoxiously close to our tables. Wasn't sure if they thought it was a club or a brunch. Other than that, like I said, the staff is awesome and considerate and that is why I gave four stars.

I had the french toast and it was good, just nothing too special for an NYC brunch. There was a few different things that turned me off. 1, the staff is EXTREMELY pushy. Our reservation was for 11:15 and most of my party was there but due to traffic, I arrived around 11:20 and the rest of my party was asked about 6 times where we were....within 5 minutes. Very bad way to begin the experience. They were told that they were going to be kicked out of the table, etc. Also, the tables are SO close together, I was practically sitting at the table behind me. When I left, I actually had to pull multiple chairs out because I couldn't pull mine back to get out. The table behind me kept looking at me strange because I was so close to their table.The bar space is very small for the volume of people eating, waiting and the ones that are finishing their drinks from brunch.

It took the very pleasant waitress about 30 min to come up to us so that we can order drinks. As we had all this time we were able to look through the menu and were ready to order the food as well. It took another 45 min-hour to get our food and drinks. The food was very blah... nothing worth waiting for, the drinks were odd, why I say odd is because all I got was a headache from them... that usually happens when I have cheap watered down alcohol.

Instead of being apologetic, both our server and the manager argued with us and provided multiple invalid excuses for why the food would have come out so late (restaurant week, miscommunication about appetizers, on and on and on). When we asked for the meals to be taken off our tab, the manager actually asked ""I don't know why you're asking for these meals to be taken off your tab"".

No apologies or checks to see if an errant shard had hit us. The waitress was just ok. She told us happy hour was until 8pm, but I had to prod to know the details - which was ""drinks are more or less half off"". Later she took my drink away while it was still 1/4 filled - but got me a new one on the house.  The service was very slow and spotty. EVERY course was served to the wrong person, and not just our table, but the ones on either side of us. The servers were either not told correct information or were guessing, but 3 courses by 3 tables = 9 incorrect guesses. Even a coin flip gets a win sometimes.  The food was good- short ribs were tender, scallops nicely cooked, risotto was very bland and cooled/coagulated quickly. Very noisy and cramped.The noise got louder until conversation was just impossible- but we're married, so awkward silences do not apply.

I did like the fact that Essex was a Chipotle-type set up. After you get your meat + tortilla, they put whatever toppings you want - pico de gallo, corn, shredded lettuce, cilantro, radish, sour cream, mild/hot salsa (cheese and guac are extra). On the other hand, my friend did not like her carne asada and chicken tacos. I tried them and they were kind of bland and tasted like it was leftover. Now I know what to avoid if I come back.

The group was given some tickets for drinks at the bar. I grab a bloody Mary (a bland bloody Mary) and sip on it casually until nearly 2pm, at which I explain my frustration to a different hostess and that we needed the table for the surprise!This hostess was much more understanding about my concerns and had us seated just in time to surprise the birthday boy. Unfortunately, the poor bloody Mary and lackluster service should have clued me in on the fact that this restaurant was not going to be good.I ordered the Deep South off the prix fix brunch menu. It was a chicken fried steak with eggs, a biscuit, and sausage gravy. What arrived was a small, sad, dried out fried steak. The biscuit was OK, as were the eggs. I tried the lox and latkes from the Aristocrat, and they were marginally better, but still not worth the price. Mimosas were kept filled. But after spending $50 per person for a meal of terrible service and poor quality food, I left quite unsatisfied.",4,2,0,Nick C.,"Ridgefield Park, NJ",379,1096,1951

There's a bar at the lower level and two different sides of table seating on the upper level. The table was upstairs, and once we arrived and surprised my BF, the waiters/waitresses immediately gave us our bottomless mimosas. The mimosas and screwdrivers were delicious. Strong, but really good. We waited about 20-30 minutes for our food and I ordered an aristocrat. It came with salmon, fish eggs, poached egg and a seafood crispy pancake at the bottom. The food was so good! We ended our stay with a few more mimosas and because we were seated late they gave us extra time for the mimosas. We also had a cake for my boyfriend and it was really cool.

Not only was this a great deal, but the food, drinks, and service were absolutely perfect. My only grudge would be the portion size of the Tuna appetizer I ordered, but no biggie. Although, I will note that one of us ordered the mussels and that portion size was enormous. There were about 5 different choices for both app and main, ranging from chicken to NY strip to salmon. I chose the steak which came over mashed potatoes and asparagus and it was cooked to perfection. I don't recall all the drink options but my drink of choice for the night was the mango margarita (some other choices I can remember: vodka soda, champagne, mojito, sangria). Note-There is also an option to upgrade to premium open bar for $80. They bring you a pitcher of your drink of choice to the table, if everyone wants to drink the same thing, or you can order by the glass. The margaritas were so delicious and definitely boozy. Probably the best marg I've ever had!Once two hours were up, we were alerted that the next party had arrived so we had to move downstairs so they could clear the table. Not a problem because we already knew our reservation was for 2 hours and besides, they let us keep the pitchers that we hadn't finished to drink them downstairs at the bar.

It was worth it for 40$ and endless mimosas. Compared to many bottomless brunch places, I think this has to be a good one. Also the service is attentive and they always know when to refill it so you don't need to constantly ask the waitress. It's very casual though so unless you plan on going somewhere else after you don't need to go in a dress and heels.

5.0,10/9/2016,"4.5/5 starsI came here for Sunday bottomless brunch with friends and had an incredible time. It's about $35 total: $30 per entree and about $5 for bottomless drinks (mimosas, bloody marys, or screwdrivers) for 1.5 hrs before 3pm. I think it's 2 hrs bottomless after 3pm. They note that they are strict about the time requirement and do turn over the tables at 1.5 hrs, so be heads up for that. It's not a problem if you expect it, but I can see how if you don't know that, it can feel rushed. I ordered the Manchego Mac and Cheese with chicken and apple sausages. The mac and cheese was very good, and the chicken and apple sausages were surprisingly good! I was a little iffy about them when I read the description, but they were delicious. My friends said that their dishes were really good as well. As for the drinks, they were very good at keeping our glasses full. I don't even really know how many glasses I actually had because they would refill it even if I had taken only a few sips. Fantastic. I hate having to wave down waiters at bottomless brunches to refill drinks. They also let my friend switch from bloody marys to mimosas. I don't think the drinks were particularly strong, but they did the trick given how often they were refilled. I'm taking .5 stars off because of the bathrooms. For women, there are only 2 stalls in the entire restaurant and one of the doors to the stalls didn't lock.

I guess 90 plus mussels and two sides of sweet potato fries per person weren't the best way to keep business. I revisited Essex with my grandmother for dinner a few weeks ago. Not exactly sure if it was the best venue to take your grandparent. The restaurant was still cleaning up and wrapping up their boozy brunch service. And the restaurant reeked spilled over alcohol. Our initial server didn't seem too interested in us. We ended up placing our order with my another server... then later confirmed with busboy. Then the original server came back and asked for our order. Not sure where the miscommunication came from but we did get our foods! We ordered two (smoked salmon, goat cheese) potato pancakes and their blackened catfish to share. The smoked salmon was a much better taste and price point wise than the goat cheese. Just one dollar difference - refer to my pictures and you will get my point. The pancakes were crunchy and tasty. But disappointingly, they were room temperature (as if they were leftovers from earlier brunch service). The catfish however won us over. The portion was huge as if they threw in the whole fish. The cream sauce was extremely tasty, the fish was fresh and juicy - and we couldn't get enough of the potato hash served underneath!

4.0,9/3/2016,"Delicious brunch with staff that are not stingy with the unlimited mimosas. They come around frequently and make sure your glass is never even half empty. I lost count of how many I actually had. The food service it self was a little slow but considering the place was packed as soon as the doors even opened, it's to be expected. Definitely make a reservation because this place you will wait! I had the biscuit and gravy with bacon and home fries. The home fries were awesome! If you don't like spicy stay away as they definitely have a kick to them with onions, red peppers, and spices. The sausage gravy was average but the biscuit was warm and soft with a nice crisp outside. Don't even bother with the other items in the menu as the brunch is killer!

Drinks are half off from 6oclock (not sure when it ends) but this includes all drinks including mojitos which I was really excited about. Drinks were strong and delicious. I had the steak with mashed potatoes and asparagus which was delicious! They cooked it exactly how I wanted. My vegan friend had the veggie burger which she said was delicious. The fries are very yummy as well. The only thing I was a little disappointed in was the dessert menu. Wanted to get the birthday girl dessert but nothing appealed to us.

3.0,8/29/2016,I came here for the last day of Restaurant week and it was a crowded Friday night. They pack a lot of tables into the space they have so getting in and out was a tight squeeze.

3.0,8/20/2016,"We were a party of 8, with reservations, relatively early for dinner on a Friday night (7 pm, so quite early)! Not sure if there was any confusion with the reservations, as I was not the one who handled that part, but we were seated in a nice booth / chair combo on an upstairs floor. Our server was lovely and I'm sure between juggling the last night of restaurant week and the regular menu, both the servers and the kitchen must have had a lot on their ""plates"" - yes, not funny. So: Service, great. If we hadn't had a ton of time on our hands, then taking 3 hours to go in and out (and we weren't big drinkers) may have seemed pretty long. But we actually wanted to sit, so it was cool. Now onto the things we consumed: 1) drinks. mixed were quite weak. wine selection weak as well, and when the sommelier of our group requested something similar to the one he'd wanted but wasn't available, all three of us who tried it agreed it was just not good. 2) food, the great part: OMG the mac and cheese was literally the best mac and cheese I have EVER tasted in all of my years on this planet. Also, the fries. There was just something special about them. Finally, the avocado sauce that comes with the calamari - I would sell my soul for that recipe. YUM. 3) food, the not so great part: the meat. Just, no. As an appetizer, the pork sliders were fatty, albeit with a nice cheese and sauce, but the ratio of meat to bread was far too low. And the pork was really, really fatty. Then, as an entree, the steak needed salt or seasoning of some kind desperately, and though the lights were dimmed by the time we received our entrees, I was suspicious that nearly 50 percent of my own steak and the steak of my uncle who sat next to me (and who previously owned a steakhouse) was FAT. UGH. I ended up taking half of my meal home, since the 8 of us had ordered enough food to feed an army, and looking at it in the light, it's quite clear that half, or more than half, is actually fat. I can't speak for any of the desserts but mine; the weird thing is that since I ordered off of the prix fixe restaurant week special menu, my dessert arrived before the other 7 members of the party were even offered dessert menus. That was weird. The coconut sorbet, however, was out of this world. All in all - the food had its amazing dishes, but its horrible dishes as well. What is that expression? Shoot or miss? Nope, that's not the expression, and I can't think of it now - wait, hit or miss - that's it - but for the prices, you should expect a hit every time, with every dish. Also, on a side note, it was far too warm in there. At times, almost suffocatingly warm. Thank goodness my family is just so excited to get together when we can, where we can, and we're really easygoing, so the food stuff just sort of took a backseat to the fact that we were enjoying ourselves in an easygoing environment.",0,0,0,Laurie F.,"Manhattan, NY",32,11,0

She did not say anything to the waitress but the waitress saw the bone on the table. She had the manager come over and he took her meal off the bill at the end. I started with bloody marys and then switched to champagne. It was a very hot day and they only had fans on so it was a little uncomfortable. I may go back but definitely at a later time.

5.0,8/13/2016,"What an incredible night was had at this place! My brother picked it out for restaurant week. I have seen it come up many times but never ventured. We had a Friday reservation. I am not sure if it was a special occasion or its every Friday but all drinks were 1/2 price all night. So roughly u were paying about $6-$7 per drink each bc they are normally $12 and up. In NYC you can't beat that for cocktails. Our waitress was amazing! She was extremely vigilant of our needs and would come to check on us frequently considering the place was packed. I will update my review with her name once I remember. She definitely deserves recognition.We went for restaurant week and ordered off that menu and also the regular menu. We had 3 orders of the dozen oysters. Very nice size, cannot attest to the taste but my fellow companions at the table raved! Next up short rib slides and ahi tuna. My brother had the short rib sliders. Very tasty! I had the ahi tuna... It was so good I forgot to be a good sister and share my tuna. But it was delicious :) . I told him that's what next time is for ...Entrees were all amazing ranging from Chilean sea bass, salmon and steak. You can't go wrong with any of them. Although the there we more options. That's what we picked. The portions were filling and we still had dessert coming. We also ordered the pork belly tacos as a side with the apps. Yummy! Drinks were super strong and delicious. I think we sampled the liquor menu in detail. Everyone went all over the place and had drinks from mixed cocktails to monitor. After we had dessert I had a special request. It's my ultimate favorite thing in the world. A scoop of vanilla ice cream and a shot of chambore on top of it. I asked the waitress if she could accommodate the odd request and she was so super nice about it. We got a healthy serving for the entire table. instead of a shot since we had been there so long time she doubled it at no extra cost. I wanted my brother and his friend to experience this delicious goodness. We closed the evening with this and everyone was in love with the place and my sinful dessert. We can't wait to go back!

It was very crowded and lively, and the food was good as well, but the drinks and service disappointed terribly. Between the four of us, all of our mimosas were a different color and taste. The batches that they make vary greatly. I had to send my first one back because it had little black specks floating in it (gross). My third drink was literally ROTTEN. They must have used expired orange juice in it. I understand that they try to make bottomless brunches economical, but I won't tolerate rotten or expired drinks. It's bad enough that they use Tropicana and cheap prosecco for their mimosas, but at least check to make sure that it's still good. The bartender kept making faces and huffing and puffing when I sent back my (dirty and rotten) drinks. Like hello? That was your fault to begin with. We all enjoyed our food, however.

My mom was champion on holding my reservation while I found parking.  It was such a mess yesterday.  I made it right on time.  So our waitress was waiting at the door for me when I walked in.  We unfortunately, was too tardy to enjoy any lobster dishes.  They had run out of lobster and burgers. So we intend to return to try the lobster.  My mom ordered The Benedicts, my sister ordered the Shrimp 'N"" Cheesy Grits, and I got The Aristocrat, after reading the reviews on here, I had to try it. I have nothing bad to say about the food, it was delightful and beautiful.  The salmon caviar was great.  We all shared our dishes and ate happily.  We had the mimosas flowing.  Our waitress didn't skip a beat with refills. In fact, she left the pitcher.  We even ordered the dessert; sorbet and coconut custard cake.  Both were equally delicious.  We were really impressed by the customer service.  Our waitress was very patient as my mom hemmed and hawed in the begging while ordered. She was pleasant and so was the rest of the staff.  Any staff were willing to help with questions.I will say the bathroom is extremely tiny.  I know it's New York and space is limited but I do believe that is the only suggested I can give on improvement.  For such a trendy place, there is lots of traffic in the bathrooms, so I think that may need to be something worth pondering.Overall great experience.  China Town/border line SoHo is a great spot to visit, so it's in a great location.

4.0,6/23/2016,"Okay so, I know this place is kind of ""trendy"" and so most people find it overrated for the prices, but I really do enjoy their food, honestly. Is that basic of me? Perhaps.One thing to note - it is PACKED. No matter when you go, it's crowded with people. You will wait for a while if you don't have a reservation, and that will annoy most people. Make a reservation.I came here with about 8 people for brunch before, and we decided to do the unlimited. The waitress was pretty decent with refills, not incredibly fast but not annoyingly slow like a lot of restaurants with unlimited. We got our fair share of drinks and at the end, she actually gave us vouchers for another drink each at the bar, because she felt like she didn't come back enough (it was packed, and she was busy, but I honestly thought she refilled the normal amount of times! I was never empty for more than two minutes. but hey, free drinks!)The food was pretty good - I got the Mexican Matzo Brei and asked to add chorizo to it, which was basically a scamble kind of huevos rancheros situation, and one of my friends got the vegan version of it. Pretty large portions, definitely happy with the portion sizes. Two of my friends got the ""Deep South"" and loved it - also a decent portion for the price of the price fixe brunch.I also came here for dinner once and also dinner during restaurant week. My review for restaurant week is different but still good - again, incredibly crowded, and obviously need a reservation and to mention that you are there for the restaurant week menu. Anyone that complains about portion sizes for restaurant week - realize that they are probably losing some money on you, and that their regular meals are NOT this size. My date got the steamed mussels for his appetizer, which was surprisingly large for restaurant week, and I got the short rib sliders. Honestly, I was disappointed at first because the restaurant week menu online had said it was to be short ribs over cheesey polenta, so when I got there and found it wasn't on the menu, I was sad. BUT the short rib sliders were probably the best part of my meal. I wish I could have just eaten like 10 of those (there were three, pretty tiny). I got the steak for my meal and it was just okay, nothing amazing but not bad either. The dessert though - that peanut butter sigh pie is a must for anyone to try.Overall, a cute restaurant.

The steak was by far the worst cut of beef I've ever been served at any restaurant. With a prix fix menu cost of $60, I guess you shouldn't expect much but this place was not worth it (unless you're going for the unlimited alcohol). Best part of my meal was probably the bread and foil wrapped butter. If you're looking for something a bit classier and looking for a good dining experience with good service (took 60 minutes to get our apps and we didn't even get them at the same time, with some of us getting them 35 minutes after we ordered) spend a few extra bucks and go somewhere else.",0,0,0,Mo T.,"Manhattan, NY",0,6,2

Not sure what this was in it previous life but they seemed to have kept general look including chain pull Windows.One comes for the food and it is okay here. On most recent visit the risotto was kind that would have gotten you kicked off top chef as neither creamy or with much flavor.  Pork was slightly overcooked as a little past medium well to well done and asked for medium.   My drink glass came with huge cracks down side that could have cut me.

Food was mediocre at best and we left half our plates, so were still hungry and we asked for the dessert menu. We were told they had 3 pies, but they were not recommended.

For my drink I had the white sangria. The sangria was delicious; strong but still very good. However, I have a pet peeve for when I order sangria and the fruit is not fresh. It was already sediment in the bottom of the glass when I got it. That's how you know its not too fresh.

We still had to wait for the table to be ready once our whole party was here. We were seated upstairs, the seating arrangement was very unusual but they fixed it for us.  They brought half of the table cold bread, some with butter and some without. They were out of several things on the menu and didn't tell people until they were bringing out the food. Two of the guests had to wait about 30 minutes for their shrimp and grits and by the time they're food came we were done. One gentleman was very upset and didn't want his food anymore so we asked for the manager. Someone came, I don't know he was but no manager of a restaurant dresses like that.

I was a bit skeptical at first due to how crowded it was, but our waitress was very attentive. Our glasses were never empty throughout the three hours that we were there.

The fried calamari comes with a cold habanero avocado dip that doesn't have any spice to it, breading could have also used seasoning. The pork belly tacos were also covered in avocado crema and pickled onions- a flavor combination that sounds like it would work, but not the way these ingredients were handled. I picked out the pork belly and tried to ignore the crema. Even the haricot verts were swimming in oil, and I think they may have used jarred garlic. There were also a BUNCH of gnats that kept attacking us. I know there's not much to be done once they get into an establishment, and sometimes that can happen, but an acknowledgement of our continuous hand waving would have been nice.They did leave when the food arrived...It was edible, but I wouldn't call it enjoyable.

We make eye contact with 2 of the waitresses just standing near the back and even though they see the hostess was busy, none of them bothered to seat or even greet us, it was like we were invisible to them. Great service there. Once the hostess got off the phone, she immediately told us sorry for the wait and sat us down, thank you for acknowledging our presence!After we were seated, THEN the waitress came to our table to greet us. I'm not sure if that's how their job is, but for an establishment, it would be nice if they could also greet customers if the hostess was busy instead of us having stand there in awkardness for a good 2 minutes. She was friendly when taking our orders though. We were there just to grab a quick bite, we ordered oysters and i ordered a shrimp avocado salad. It's not my first time here so I've tried their calamari, burgers and other stuff before.The oysters were decent, but I would've preferred if they offered tabasco. I ordered a bellini and i really liked it. The shrimp on the salad was a bit over salted but the rest of it tasted okay. The only complaint i have is i don't exactly like warm salads.

The crowd was gone and It was almost 5pm, I asked another hostess calmly about our table and she said they were cleaning it. As we were waiting next to the booths, the busser was cleaning the table with windex. He was holding the setting napkins in his hand and placed them on the table. One of them literally fell on the floor and he picked it up and continued to set the table. That was disgusting!

The server was great. She explained the menu and served us the drinks quickly. She checked up on us time to time. The food took forever though. It was like another hour wait for the food.

My food came out cold and I asked if they can please reheat it and it was amazing. I got the eggs Benedict. It was great. My friend got the Mac and cheese which was AMAZING and my other friend got the eggs and country fried steak which to wasn't bad. All in all.

4.0,2/16/2016,"My biggest complaint with this place is that they are total sticklers on time, which is very annoying. Your party will not be able sit down until every person has arrived and they will start a timer on you. Also if you do not have a reservation, be ready to wait for a while. Essex is very packed, busy, and loud- not the place for a low key brunch.Aside from that, I was surprised by the food. The Mexican Matzo Brei and the Southern were delicious. Our waiter Derek was attentive and friendly, which made up for our terrible experience at the front door. Ultimately, I would definitely recommend this place if you are looking for a more lively brunch without compensating for food.",0,0,0,Evelyn S.,"Brooklyn, NY",15,6,0

4.0,2/8/2016,"My roommate & I wanted to celebrate our birthdays together, so we found a pretty awesome brunch deal: $25.95 for one entree + three drinks (mimosa, bloody mary, or screwdrivers).  So, we made reservations for 6.  I'm going to get the negatives out of the way... I totally get it.  If you agree to have a certain amount of people show up at a certain time, then yeah, it's kind of crappy when not everyone is there on time.  But, 2 of our people were delayed due to trains being rerouted & clusterf*cky as MTA tends to do on weekends.  The restaurant's policy, though, is to not seat the table unless everyone is there.  So, the 4 of 6 of us stood hovering in the doorway before the restaurant manager came over with the most passive-aggressive and downright snotty attitude, saying that we have to be seated because there was a table reservation after ours & we were screwing the schedule up.Um.  The restaurant was mostly empty, & our party was mostly here.  And, even after we had been there for 2 hours, there were plenty of open tables around us to accommodate all reservations...... luckily our server was amazing, because I was really rubbed the wrong way by that interaction.Also a heads up:  even though they advertise brunch starts at 11, you're not going to get served alcohol until noon because of some state restriction.  Uhh.  What about all of the other restaurants around NYC where I can get a pitcher at 10 AM?  Anyway......Our server was amazing.  Amanda S was the coolest & incredibly helpful, down-to-Earth, & really just wanted us to enjoy our birthday brunch.  We decided to order & start with our food in the meantime & enjoy alcohol for dessert.They brought out a side of garlic rolls and GOSH YUM I LOVE GARLIC CARBS.  I ordered the Mexican Mazo Brei as my entree, and it was super filling & delicious.  I'm not a fan of eating black beans separately, so I wish they would've been mixed into the rest of the omelette, but whatever.  All of my friends enjoyed their miscellaneous entrees as well.  And finally, time for drinks: according to my roomie, the bloody mary is pretty bad.  I stuck to screwdrivers & enjoyed myself!So, yes Yelpers.  I'd say the brunch deal is fantastic & worth checking out, but learn from this experience.1- Go after 12pm; get a reservation.2- To avoid the 'tude of the manager, make sure your party all shows up on time. (which I know is like sheparding cats sometimes)3- Ask for Amanda S.",8,6,8,Davina F.,"New York, NY",414,211,91
4.0,2/4/2016,"Came here for restaurant week and what a treat! The ambiance and loft atmosphere was so fun and cute. I started with the oysters as my first course, which were delicious. I really enjoyed their dipping sauces, one was cocktail sauce with horseradish and then the other was a vinaigrette. I also noticed signs that during regular hours, oysters are only $1 during happy hour - WHAT A DEAL! Then as my main course, I had the scallops over risotto which was delicious as well. But the best part of the experience was the dessert. I will come back here for their $1 oysters and peanut butter pie. It was amaze balls, a peanut butter mouse in a graham cracker shell. YUMM!!! The only downfall of the night and reason for not giving 5-stars was I had to wait for my friend for about 20 minutes. I sat at the bar to wait and thought I'd get a drink. Granted there was only one bartender (but it was not that busy), it took 10 minutes for me  to get noticed, and then she was busy making tables drinks, other guests, etc. I never got my drink by the time my friend arrived, so I told her to just forget it. I wanted to leave because of this but I am so glad I stayed.",2,2,2,Jenna U.,"Mahwah, NJ",392,395,49
2.0,2/4/2016,"I was super excited to try out Essex for restaurant week. The menu for Essex really stood out to me and my friend, who I actually took for her birthday dinner. I arrived 10 minutes early for my 7pm reservation on Sunday and Essex was packed. I definitely wasn't expecting it to be this packed/loud on a Sunday night. I did later find out that they have happy hour on Sunday's until 8pm. When I first walked in I didn't know where I was going. I couldn't find a hostess or a waiter/waitress to even ask. I went up to a bartender and they instructed me to go to the center of the restaurant to the hostess stand where they had a computer to check in. I found my way through the crowd of people in the bar area and there was so many people waiting for the hostess who seemed to be missing. I finally found her and let her know I was there for my 7pm reservation. Long story short my friend and I waited 25 minutes to be seated. After we were seated it took about 10 minutes for someone to come over to ask if we'd like to order a drink. We ordered the mango lava lamp drink and it was excellent! From the time we received our drinks until someone came by to take our order it was about 20 minutes. When our waitress came by to take our order she did apologize that they were understaffed. It was very clear that our waitress was taking on a lot more than she could handle, but she seemed very nice and apologetic. Our appetizer came in good time after we ordered. I started out with the goat cheese potato pancakes and my friend had the burrata salad. We both really enjoyed the appetizers. After we finished it took quite awhile longer to get our entrees. I decided to go with the steak after waitress recommendation and my friend had the scallops over risotto. I ordered my steak medium rare and it came out over cooked. I didn't bother saying anything because I knew it would take a long time to get a new one brought out. The meal was just OK. I had a taste of the scallops and they were very delicious, but the risotto didn't really have a taste at all. It was actually quite bland. Our waitress was so kind and offered to get us another round of drinks on the house because she knew how long we had been waiting for everything. We really just wanted to get out of there at this point so we kindly declined. For dessert I ordered the chocolate mousse cake and my friend had the sorbet. They both weren't anything special at all. Really disappointed by the experience I had at Essex. Everywhere I've gone for restaurant week has actually surpassed my expectations and this is the first time I've really had a not so great experience. I've heard the brunch at Essex is excellent, but I'm not sure that I would even go back again.

I've had better food at an Applebees or Longhorn steakhouse.Dessert took forever.

I mean insane, the lobby/bar packed wall to wall with more people itching to get their hands at a table. Honestly after the meal I would tell them to pass. I got the shrimp and grits which tasted good, but after eating them my stomach started to kill, and I was in and out of the TINY two stall bathroom for the rest of brunch. I'm not sure if the food was to blame or the mimosas, which, to their credit were filled up constantly, but which tasted real weird. Not like any orange juice I've ever tasted, more like Sunny D. Also worth noting I wasn't even tipsy after like 5 of them, just nauseous.

1.0,1/30/2016,"This was a huge disappointment. We had a reservation for the restaurant and our complete party was there and we ended up waiting 30 minutes to be seated. We had to sit upstairs the steps going up were very slippery and I was scarred I was going to fall with my heels. We were given 3 different menus that looked amazing at 9:20. We were given water at 9:45. There was a regular menu, restaurant week menu, and a pre fixe menu. The difference between restaurant and prefix they had different starters and entrees plus the restaurant week had desert. The prefix was unlimited alcohol for 2 hrs. I chose the prefix. Our order went in at 9:50. We had to inquire about our food 3 times. I ordered the pork belly tacos and they were mediocre. That green sauce took away from the taste and the cilantro was overpowering. At 11:25 we received that our starter. 12:01 we received our entrees. Which was the same time they started to shut down the restaurant. I ordered a medium steak and it was rubbery and tasteless. I asked for a side of sauce and salt but that made no difference. It was a complete waste of calories. My server was ok when I saw him,but I had to keep locating him for things that I wanted. As a server you should be one step ahead of me. Or at least refill my water glass more than once. I had to keep begging for water. I would ask and 30minutes later my cup was still empty. I ended up drinking everyone  else's water and asking a different server. I was tempted to walk up to the bar and pour it myself since there was a pitcher sitting in plain eyesight! This place is known for brunch so if you're going to try I recommend that. Don't go when you are hungry.

If i didn't have 3 mimosas and if my stomach wasn't eating itself, I would of left the food untouched. I ordered the biscuits and gravy and it was pretty gross. Honestly I could make it better at home. My friends ordered salads and French toast and again, none of them really touched their food either. Simple dishes, POOR execution.Very minimal effort put into the taste and quality of the food. The bread that came out was straight out of a fridge and the butter was also frozen... The biscuit tasted straight out of a plastic bag and the gravy was poorly seasoned and the sausage chunks tasted like elementary school lunch.Atmosphere is the only saving grace.

Their potato latke with smoked salmon, roe, and crème fraîche is representative of quintessential Lower East Side with a modern flare in it's preparation. Your best bet to get in is to make a reservation a week or so in advance, which will also have you waiting up to 30 minutes upon arrival.

My daughter's was considerable larger than the other 2.  There wasn't anything special about the bread pudding.  Overall, it didn't seem like there was much time spent on presentation or quality control. The food seemed like it was prepared way ahead of time before people even place their order.  The service was alright.  The server was attentive.  The food runners were abrupt and just handed over food.  The place wasn't super busy but maybe it is because the place/staff wasn't quite prepare to handle Thanksgiving.  The place seem promising when I made the reservations several weeks ago.  I liked how it did have the traditional turkey dinner option.  We really wanted to like the place but we will not be returning for Thanksgiving.",0,0,0,Thear H.,"Alexandria, VA",7,11,38

As a person from the south I was praying they would be good and wonders of wonders they were! Soo yummy and big portion. Our waitress was very nice but reminded us there was a time limit for the table - totally understandable with the cattle below.

I had reservations for 8:30 and even though half my party was late, we were promptly seated. We ordered the prix menu which included an appetizer, entree, and 2.5 hour open bar for 60 bucks/person. The food and drinks were absolutely perfect. I had the pork belly tacos, which were well-flavored with a bit of spice, and the steak (delicious with some of the best mashed potatoes I've ever had). However, my main reason for writing this review is to rave about our waitress, Sue. She was by far the best waitress I've ever had and all my guests agreed. When the night started, I made a joke to my friends that, because it was my 30th birthday celebration, I should always have a drink in my hand. I think Sue heard because once our 2.5 hour drink window started, she preemptively refilled our alcoholic beverages without us having to ask. And she was quick with order changes and super efficient when it came to the food orders. She was wonderfully friendly and attentive without being overbearing. She truly made my birthday a night to remember. Thanks, Sue!All in all, this is an excellent place to have a celebratory dinner or a dinner with friends.

I pulled the server aside who rudely brushed me off when I asked her what was going on. for the record- I am in the industry so i get it, maybe she forgot to fire... but one hour later and we still don't have 1st course?! I decided to speak with the manager, i got up from the table and stopped a male waiter to ask to see the manager who then told me that he was behind the bar and to go there..??  The bar at this point was so packed i couldn't even get close to speak with anyone. Finally at 9:40PM, the first course came out. I asked the server to fire entree right away... but we were not served our entree until 10:30PM! i should also mention around the 10PM hour, a server spilled red wine on my friends dinner jacket- and when we pointed it out the server said bring me the bill after you dry clean it. (?!!) what kind of service is that. My friend didn't live in the city so the gesture meant nothing. When i finally got to the manager by the end of the meal now 10:45PM he said ""yea it took a while you ordered the pre-fixed with 2.5hrs of open bar"".

HH includes their beers, wines, and cocktails (everything is 50%), so everything ranges about $5-7, which is decently priced.I had a glass of their chardonnay, and it was standard. Their blue points were large in size, but not especially plump, and many of my oysters even had bits of shell in them, as I was spitting them back out. Also tried the Potato Pancake with salmon, but the pancake was very thin and too crunchy. The salmon helping was a good size, and a good price for an additional $2.I'd come here if you just want to chat with a friend over some oysters and drinks, but not if you're particularly seeking a good meal.

Then, she proceeded to sit us in a very uncomfortable table right on the walkway for the staff to pass with food and drinks while a ""walk in"" couple got seated at a much better table, out of the way, by the veranda, overlooking the whole restaurant downstairs.   I don't know but logic dictates that if you have a reservation you should probably have preferred seating.  Moreover, although the service from our waiters, Isa and Mo, was excellent, the food was really nothing to write home about.  I had The Aristocrat and my husband ordered the burger.

Having said that, our server made an issue with charging us the correct amount, and accidentally charged our cards the wrong amount and had to correct this. This doesn't matter to me as mistakes can happen anytime, and the issue was fixed quickly and they gave us 2 free drinks each to make up for it.Everything was great, this place is highly recommended.",0,0,0,Josh B.,"New York, NY",0,13,0
4.0,8/16/2015,"Went for brunch on a Sunday. They have a great deal. $25 bucks gets you an entree and 3 cocktails. We had the banana chocolate pancakes topped with strawberries & blueberries. They were absolutely delicious. My only complaint is that there weren't a lot of bananas in the actual pancakes and the chocolate was buried in the middle. We also ordered the lobster Benedict. Also very delicious, al thought they served it with mixed greens (even though they said it came with Kale) and the greens themselves weren't the freshest. Also ordered a side of the hand cut fries. YUMMMMMM. Those were my favorite. For cocktails, I chose the mimosas. The first one came with too much OJ and not enough bubbly. I asked the waiter to swap it out and he ended up brining me champagne for the remainder of the drinks with non OJ- MUCH BETTER! Service was great, the music is awesome, and the crowd is great. They have a nice bar scene and delicious. Really enjoyed the whole experience and I'd def come back.",1,0,0,Cessie C.,"Manhattan, NY",370,158,415
3.0,8/16/2015,Food was very good but not happy about 3 drinks included. New York law will not allow them to serve until after 12 on Sunday.  Since we sat down at 11:15 and finished eating at noon we assumed that the price would not include drinks. As we finished eating the server told us he could now bring us drinks. He never told us that we would have to pay for them even though they couldn't serve us till we were done. There was no way the six of us could drink 3 cocktails after eating so much. And we needed to be across town anyway.

I didn't drink anything, and ended up spending over $40 for a burger. Furthermore, each topping on the burger (cheese, bacon, mushrooms, egg) was an additional $1.50. Wtf?!

We could not hear the server and she couldn't hear us. The food was not worth the price. Two friends got the shrimp and avocado salad (which is really their fault because who gets that for brunch) but it was made up mostly of cucumbers.

2.0,8/6/2015,"-Came here for the dollar oysters, left slightly dissapointed. Half of our 48 oysters ordered were literally nickle sized. I don't expect all their dollar oysters to be generous in size, but seriously, half of them? -Their pork belly tacos were also sub-par. At the price of $12 for 3 miniature tacos, I was expecting excellent pork belly to compensate. Unfortunately their ""pork belly"" tasted 100% like chicken; it even looked like chicken.-Beer is beer so I can't complain too much, I was just expecting bottles rather than draft.-Calamari was the only thing noteworthy. Fried to perfection for a crispy, crunchy exterior while maintaining a soft interior. The avocado habanero dipping sauce was a nice touch as well, although the portion was small.Overall, I did not hate my experience, seating was quick, and staff was attentive and abundant.

I was stuck between giving it three and four stars, but I really had to go with four.The ambiance is awesome. Candlelit, open, spacious and very trendy place to hang out on the Lower East side. Really modern and chic atmosphere that is not pretentious. Our server was phenomenal. He was very patient, speedy and efficient, fun and humorous, and pretty much felt like family by the end of the night. We went with the open bar option, and normally wait staff tends to take their time when delivering drinks, he was RUNNING to us with them, that in and of itself deserves five stars! Such an awesome personality, I truly wish I remembered his name. We started with the DOLLAR OYSTERS, we got about two dozen for our table and they were delicious and came with lemons and two sauces, varying size oysters which is great. Such good bang for your buck. We decided to spring for the 60$ price fix menu option. This included unlimited drinks for 2.5 hours, an appetizer per person, and an entree per person. Totally worth the price! As I said earlier, the drinks were free flowing and strong yet delicious, perfectly made. We went through several pitches of regular mojitos, mango mojtos, white sangria and red sangria, ALL strong and delicious. The food...was OK, I was definitely not disappointed, but was definitely underwhelmed. My appetizer were the mussels in white sauce. Great tasting sauce, nice amount of mussels, but the mussels were so tiny, probably each one was the size of a fingernail. I guess the amount of mussels makes up for the size? For an entree I got the steak and mashed potatoes. I usually am very snobby about steak, the steak was OK but not the best I've ever had. I will say it was easy to eat and melt in your mouth good. The potatoes were bland. I tried a co-workers vegetable risotto, it was OK, but definitely not creamy enough! Co-workers who ordered the mac and cheese loved it.

Brunch was delicious and perfect portions- we were stuffed. Each meal came with 3 drinks (your choice of mimosa, bloody mary, or screw driver) for $25 per person (before tax and tip). My friend saw the bartender pour a bottle of champagne into a pitcher, so we knew the drinks were strong. She also saw them use OJ concentrate... hrm.

I'll start out with the positives - the atmosphere and service at Essex is great - it objectively was a great place to have a dinner because of their prix fixe dinner menu with all-you-can-drink for two hours. The waitress was amazing and brought us pitchers of mojitos and was really good about filling up our drinks and our water glasses. She was quick with bringing out food and really accommodating when we asked to put a birthday candle in one of their desserts. Unfortunately, though the positives stop there. The food was very much not worth the price we paid. For appetizers, most of my friends ordered the mussels, but they did not get decent sized portions, and most of the mussels were actually closed. The best appetizer was honestly the kale salad, but it's really hard to mess that up.

I am not a picky eater whatsoever--I go to Epstein's, Freeman's, Sauce, and a bunch of other brunch places in LES and the East Village regularly, and I couldn't even attempt to finish my brunch at Essex.My girlfriend and I got the Southern Style brunch (chicken fried steak, biscuits, gravy, and eggs) and the Mac & Cheese, both of which were highly recommended in prior Yelp reviews. The steak was extremely chewy, difficult to cut through, and appeared to be a low quality cut of meat. The biscuit was cold, stale, and dry--supermarket quality at best. The only redeeming aspect was the eggs, which were light and fluffy, but we didn't expect the eggs to be the best part of this meal.The mac and cheese tasted identically to a Stouffer's TV dinner. The side salad was just field greens without dressing. The side of apple sausage was decent, but very small (imagine again, out of a TV dinner).We opted into the $25 booze brunch deal (3 drinks and a brunch entrée). The drinks were tiny (served out of a 8 or 9 oz old fashioned glass) with orange juice concentrate (we saw the bartenders pour out of it) and cheap vodka. It was also difficult to place our orders--we tried to get the servers' attention several times with no success.

Once we received our food (the deep south and the southern) we was happy... The food was good I loved the chicken sausage and the biscuit with sausage gravy was great! Bellinis was standard oysters was average as well..... Essex is a hip brunch place people leave here bent!!! by time we came 5:30 the place was cleared out so we had a calm late brunch....I been here once before to brunch and I had fun it was in the mist of brunch so it was packed and jumping! don't remember what I ate though....

4.0,6/1/2015,"After much research of brunch venues in NYC, I selected Essex to celebrate my birthday. Which are two of my favorite things to do. We had reservations for 12:45 but due to the crazy traffic (on a Sunday) we ended up having to wait for two of our guests to arrive from NJ. The hostess, Reema, was cool about it, let us know it would be a wait but that they could still accommodate us. I was grateful for this. We checked in (I'm a Yelper after all :) and got Mimosa's while we waited for $6! The party had begun even before we were seated. The vibe was definitely high energy. Essex was packed! It didn't take long to be seated and we almost immediately were receiving another mimosa as soon as we sat down. The waiter was kind enough to fulfill my request of mostly champagne and a little OJ.  We all ordered different entrees and the shrimp and avocado salad, french toast and burger were a hit. The shrimp and grits were not what was expected (see the picture posted) I don't think folks from the south that have an idea of what Shrimp and Grits should be would order it again. As it  was more of a hip NYC version. All in all. I was tipsy, my food was delicious and Essex had great service. I will definitely be back!",2,0,1,Shaviece H.,"Montclair, NJ",97,165,186

Because we came before 12 we had to wait for our mimosas and screwdrivers but, they promptly starting taking orders at 12. The drinks were strong and well worth the wait.

3.0,5/26/2015,"I spent my weekend in the city and decided to find a place that had $1 oysters. Really, that was the main reason for having this dinner. We made reservations for 6:45 but we ran late, it was no biggie and they seated us promptly. The place was rather empty at 7PM. A group of drunk people standing outside, we figured the drinks must be good; and they definitely were. The pickled saint was great! strong and refreshing on a hot day and long walk.The fried calamari was good, crispy and fresh. The arugula and goat cheese potatp pancake was pretty to die for, with a nice slab of melted goat cheese. For the main entree we ordered the catfish, which was good but too salty for our liking.Oh, but I thought we came here for oysters. we put in an order for 12. The table next to us who ordered probably 5 minutes before us, probably ordered 2 dozen of those bad boys for 2 people. they looked good, man they looked good. Half way through our appetizers our waiter comes over and tells us there are no oysters left. What? literally? not even 2?  My face literally went from happy to sad. I wouldn't have minded if they had just mentioned it earlier that way i would have gone my merry way somewhere else, i feel like they told us halfway through our appetizer because they wanted us to stay. i didnt see anyone else get oysters after the table next to us got theirs, so they clearly knew they had none. Coming from Jersey, you better bet I had a whole list of places I wanted to check out, and i only came here because their HH ended at 8. So that knocked down 1 star.The other star got taken because their bathroom was just DISGUSTING. It looked like a   club bathroom by 4AM. toilet paper all over the place, reaked of urine, everything was wet. it seriously turned me off.",0,0,0,Erica J.,"East Brunswick, NJ",150,15,62
1.0,5/25/2015,"I made a reservation online, confirmed it 48 hours in advanced, but unfortunately arrived a little less than 20 minutes late with my whole party of 6, half who were jetlagged from half way around the world. I swore to them that this was my ultimate favorite brunch spot, the experience to have, and that the staff was great, so everyone was expecting to have a great time.OH BOY WAS I VERY VERY VERY WRONG! We walked in behind three groups of people whom the bouncer told them that there was no wait and that the line was only for checking in because they didn't have a reservation. I checked in with the maitre'd and she confirmed my reservation. Another two groups came in behind me. Everyone else that came in before AND AFTER my whole group was attended to and seated promptly and my group was left standing at the door for 30 minutes before we were told by another staff member that we had missed our 15 minute grace period and our table was already given away (to the people that we checked in with). Our only option was to sit at the bar or else we would have to wait at least 45 minutes because OUR PARTY OF 6 WAS TOO DIFFICULT TO SEAT (I have been here in the past with a party of 15 with no problem) and there was nothing she could do because it was a full house. We stood at the doorway for another 10 minutes and yet no one walked in. Sorry, it was not that busy and I do not understand why you guys had to wait so long to tell us that we could not be seated. The only excuse that was given to us was that the maitre'd was ""new and did not know the policy so she didn't tell us upon checking in"". Sorry, but is that even a valid excuse? If your staff messed up, then shouldn't we have been seated? You could have just seated us as a courtesy and give us a nice heads up and say don't be late next time!I did not appreciate the fact that we had to wait 30 minutes before we were attended to and ending up being told that our table was given away because of insufficient training of an employee and having the employee say, ""it was my bad"" and think that the problem was solved. If I was told upon check-in that I had to wait 45 minutes, I would not have been angry, but for me and my guests to stand 30 minutes with no service at the doorway and be asked to wait at least another 45 minutes because of poor staff training is BEYOND RIDICULOUS.If you are running a minute more than 15 minutes late because of traffic, poor directions, or MTA problems, don't even bother to show up for your reservation because this is how you will be treated. Their strict 15 minute policy means that they will give your table away.Don't get me wrong, the food and drinks here are great, but I will never come back even though I have been a loyal patron who has come here for brunch, introduced friends to this place, and threw my birthday parties here in the past.

5.0,5/5/2015,"Came here for brunch on a Sunday. The space is great, simplistic with high ceilings and tons of natural light. Music was fun, house-y and upbeat, and at a good volume. There were several people waiting to be seated but we were seated promptly within 10 minutes. Waitstaff are super friendly, shoutout to Mo, Isa, and Carlos ;) Their brunch deal is any entree plus 3 drinks. The bloody mary was delicious, good spiciness, not weak, but definitely weaker than their mimosas, which are mostly champagne with a splash of OJ, just how I like em. Price for the brunch is around $27. In my experiences with brunch deals which include drinks, the food is always sup-par, maybe cause they can get you drunk enough that you don't care. However, I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of the food here. My friend got French toast bananas foster, one of the best french toasts I have ever had, will opt for this in my future visits. I got the aristocrat, which was like a potato latke eggs benedict with huge pieces of raw salmon. Was hesitant at first, but salmon was SO fresh.There was a large group of bachelorette bitches brunching near us. I overheard a couple of them complaining about I have no idea what, but later I saw the server bring them all free bottles of champagne and shots of fireball sent by the owner/manager. We finished our food, and were pleasantly surprised to get a couple extra mimosas on the house. I inquired why the restaurant was so hospitable, giving us extra mimosa and the ladies next to us free shots. The server explained to me that the owner's philosophy is centered around customer satisfaction, and that the price of a few shots is nothing if customers genuinely had a good experience and could pass on the good review to others. I thought this was pretty intelligent, with our generation being so review/yelp crazed. But it truly does separate an establishment when you feel well taken care of. C'mon, this is NYC; you can find great food and drinks in A LOT of places, but feeling as welcome and taken care of as Essex made me feel is a rare find in the big apple.

To be honest, I think I've tried better and fluffier French toast with a nicer presentation at other places. I also tried a little bit of the famous Aristocrat, it was pretty good as well.

3.0,4/23/2015,"Essex, what am I going to do with you?! You've been one of my go-to brunch spots for years! I love your food, I don't even mind your waits but your service has gone seriously downhill.I had my boozy birthday brunch here for the second time a few weeks ago to celebrate turning 25 for the fourth time. I made a reservation for 17 people at 1:45  (for the large party brunch deal - $35 for an entree and two hours of unlimited drinks) on a Sunday and got there a few minutes early. By the time the reservation time rolled around, there were about 10 of us there. The hostess had us wait by the bar for another 15 minutes or so and then came back, gave us each one drink ticket each and told us that our two hours of unlimited drinks was starting, but that they still couldn't seat us. A little annoying, but not everyone was there (we were up to 14 at that point) and at least we were getting our drinks on.We got sat around 2:30 on one of the upstairs balcony. I was under the impression that I had reserved said balcony (based on their website and the price we were quoted for the large party ""balcony,"" brunch) but that wasn't even the issue. The problem was that the table was TINY (see pic - the little table on the end wasn't added until I complained to a manager and they moved a family dining with their infant.) There was no way that we were all going to fit - and most of my friends are pretty thin! The second problem was the waitress. She SUCKED. We had to repeatedly ask for water, repeatedly ask for drinks, repeatedly ask for silverware and for napkins. She couldn't handle taking more than 2 or 3 drink/food orders at a time which was annoying. I was a waitress for years and am generally sympathetic to service but this was atrocious! Thankfully I was surrounded by my closest friends and fairly liquored up (because they, NOT the waitress made sure the birthday girl always had a drink) so still had a good time, but she really put a damper on the day.The food is still great (I had the latkes but the Benedict's, french toast, southerner and mac and cheese all got rave reviews) but the portions have gotten pretty small (and I am not one to complain about portion size normally.)This is a 2.5 star review. I'm rounding up to three because of the food quality and happy memories past but I won't be back with a large party again.",3,0,1,Jessie H.,"Brooklyn, NY",447,27,21

I... I guess. ""How would you like your eggs?"" Runny, sunny-side up. I wish I had the option of my biscuit burnt or not burnt because if you refer to my picture, that's not an attractive color for a biscuit. Sometimes I like to make a little sandwich out of my chicken. Biscuit, eggs, gravy, chicken, and more biscuit. There existed no structural integrity for that biscuit, I ate my chicken with a fork. Not bad, but now the biscuit had crumbled into a pile of grits. Cool, I suppose *whispers* not cool.For $25 I was hoping to get a bigger piece of meat and more gravy. I instead was given 3 eggs to fill the plate-- that was not runny as per not agreement. At least they got the sunny side up right. Tsk Tsk Tsk. Just counting down the stars. The mimosas were alright and so were the $1 oysters... but I can't seem to justify dishing out $50 for alright.This has been the friendly version of this review.

Our server came over and informed us that happy hour would be ending soon so, if we wanted to take advantage of their offerings, to order quickly. We decided to get a heaping pile of their dollar oysters. They were fresh and well prepared. We also got a few cocktails even though the voucher came with drinks since they were discounted. We each tried the Honey Pot and the Watermelon Martini, both of which were very good.For starters, we shared the Essex Famous Potato Pancakes with Gravlax and Salmon Caviar; NOM. They were SOOOOO good. For the second course, I had the Scallops atop Risotto which tasted great but the size of the meal was significantly smaller than other pictures I've seen of it. That was a bit of a let down; even the scallops were half the size of the normal serving and I am attributing that to the fact that we were using a voucher. It happens more often than not. My sister ordered the Salmon which was served with red quinoa and kale tabbouleh. It had a good taste but was a bit over for my liking; my sister on the other hand, likes her food well done so she was happy with the dish. We shared the Warm Molten Lava cake for dessert; it was as it is at most places, a lava cake. Nothing overwhelmingly special about it but it tasted good and we enjoyed it.We had a good night, save for the rambunctious and slightly belligerent group seated next to us but we were in our dining bubble and tried our best to enjoy our space and evening.

I found the calamari underwhelming (one of the girls really liked the avocado dip tho) but overall enjoyed the food and thought it was adequate. We also got the pork tacos, kale salad, fries, potato pancake, short rib sliders, tuna, mac and cheese with chorizo and chicken lollipops. My faves were probably the chicken (surprisingly, nice flavor and perfectly cooked - not dry!) and short rib sliders (not too saucy like they sometimes are). We got the coconut pie and lava cake for dessert. I loved the coconut pie and I suppose the cake was decent but I'm not a huge fan of dark chocolate so probably couldn't give someone who does like chocolate a good opinion.Service was extremely attentive and thoughtful. I noted the waiter brought over extra ketchup without our asking and water was always deftly and efficiently refilled. Plates were also removed quickly which was essential since the table was small and we shared a lot of stuff.The one thing of note was that the music was soooooo loud. I was screaming at the person sitting right next to me and all of us were eventually driven out by the noise (my throat literally hurt from trying to converse). It was like having dinner in a bar.

3.0,3/17/2015,"3 1/2 stars for this Lower East version of Lauriol Canyon.  It is amazing how the Lower East Side has become a hotbed for Latino culture, including restaurant/bars.  Essexi is certainly a youthful, restaurant where you can have some fun, and quality food.  The bluepoint oyster appetizers were wonderful, although I question whether they were bluepoints.  The potato pancake with goat cheese did not live up to my expectations except for the goat cheese.  The scallops with risooto was a fine dish, and the sangria was refreshing, although not as strong as I would have liked.  If you are looking for a trendy Lower East side meal Essex will do the trick.",1,0,1,Thomas W.,"New York, NY",1279,814,545

Also, the ""fresh fruit"" refers to about 4 blackberries and slices of strawberries. The syrup disappeared halfway through my eating experience, which was a bit disappointing because I wanted more.

Our waiter was friendly and funny. We had the unlimited mimosas, of course, and our waiter was awesome at making sure that our glasses were never empty. I don't even remember what my friends ordered - all I know is that I totally won with the Lobster Benedict. They gave me a nice chunk o' Lobster! I was completely satisfied.

Those are the two must haves for me. Their drinks are good too.. Mostly get mojitos. Their service varies becos they tend to forget abt u when it gets busy..

3.0,2/17/2015,I came to Essex for brunch this past weekend for a friends birthday for the first time. The restaurant itself is really beautiful- right when you walk in is the bar and really high ceilings. The entire space is really open and airy which is always a plus in NYC. This is where the problem starts for me though- when you first walk in it is extremely crowded. The hostess stand is past the bar and most of the time the hostesses are walking around the bar area with ipads- they are very hard to find. We had a reservation for 1:30 and the table wasn't ready so they gave us a bunch of drink tickets which was great. We had a group of 15 people so I realize that is definitely not easy to accommodate- the waiter was great and was constantly refilling our drinks and never rushed us to leave (we were there for about 3 hours). The bloody mary's were made with a homemade mix and they were amazing- probably the best I have ever had at a bottomless brunch.I ordered The Southern and when they brought it out the eggs were not cooked. I couldn't eat them and it was pretty disappointing. It also arrived to the table 5 minutes after everyone else already had their food. As I mentioned earlier- we were in a huge group and everyone else loved their food so one out of 15 isn't terrible.I would definitely go back but with a smaller group!,1,0,0,Alex B.,"East Village, Manhattan, NY",3,3,0

I ordered the kale Caesar salad and for an entree I had steak. The steak was very dry and it also wasn't very warm, so that wasn't great. We had a 2.5 hour open bar so our server kept bringing us drinks once he saw our glasses were nearly empty. The weird thing was that my second round of Cosmo tasted extremely different from my first round and not in a good way. I wasn't too happy with my second drink. However, the service was very good.

2.0,2/14/2015,"This was my first time here and I must say that I was partially pleased. To start off the place was a bit crowded yet the atmosphere was lively with vibrant people. I just can't get over the extremely small ladies restroom however, which was poorly kept. Aside from wondering where the hostess was upon my arrival, oh wait, did I mention that the overcrowding at the entrance makes it hard for a first timer to see the hostess. Well yes, it did. Needless to say, the hostess was extremely warm and welcoming so she made me feel welcome. Despite the overcrowding, the table wait was not long at all. Now....on to the food, I ordered ""the Deep South"" which consisted of a chicken fried steak, eggs topped with sausage gravy and biscuit and of course, unlimited mimosas. The biscuit was extremely dry and kept falling apart. The chicken fried steak was horrible and the best part of my meal were the eggs and the side of delicious french toast. Would I visit again? I would for those great mimosas, eggs and French toast but I really wish they would improve that bathroom and push the hostess station to the door so first timers won't be totally lost.",1,0,0,Kai M.,"Brooklyn, NY",107,86,117
2.0,2/10/2015,"Made a reservation a month in advance for a 20 person brunch which included unlimited Mimosas, Screwdrivers, Bloody Mary's and one brunch entree of our choice. The price was $35 per person before gratuity. Warning, the online information is inaccurate, stating the brunch is $25 p/p. It's $35. Here is what went down that day. The reservation was for 3:30, so we made sure to arrive at 3:15 so that we had enough time to gather the group together, be seated, etc. We wanted every second of those three unlimited boozing hours. After all, it was a mini college sorority reunion and we hadn't seen each other in a long time! The place is deceiving, looks very small from the outside but extends back pretty far. Only two bathroom stalls for women in the entire place and they are located immediately upon walking into the restaurant, so there is a constant traffic jam immediately entering the place. There is no hostess stand or anyone checking in parties seating people. It was pretty disorganized and a little bit of a mad house at 3:15 on a Saturday afternoon. The bar had Bloody Mary's pre-poured in rocks glasses ready to dispense them to anyone who was involved with the all you can drink brunch. Few things less appetizing than warm Bloody Mary's sitting out for god only knows how many hours at a time. If they tasted good, I would have been okay with it but they were AWFUL. The mix had sunk to the bottom from sitting there all day and the vodka was on top. They were warm, tasteless and watery. So disappointing, needed to be shaken and kept in a cooler. We would have been more than happy waiting the extra twenty minutes or so in between drinks to wait for a proper Bloody to be crafted. We weren't seated until around 3:50 and when we were, we were escorted to a large table at the top of the stairs. There were other parties ranging from 3 to 8 upstairs as well.  Booth seating, so I knew once I was seated in the dead center, I wasn't moving for the next three hours until brunch was over. Getting out of that with a group of 20 just wasn't happening. We were given menus, one side had a list of entrees included for a $60 brunch and the other side was ours, indicating it was for the $34 brunch. However, on that menu, there were sides, drink options, and other choices for an upcharge. Since the bloody Mary's we were given were so horrible, a couple of us decided to upgrade to the Bloody Morty which was a Bloody but with bacon infused vodka. We figured that maybe these would be cold, fresh and drinkable. THEY WERE HORRENDOUS. I am not even trying to exaggerate, undrinkable and nauseating. They had such an intense smoky flavor that it was wildly overwhelming and sickening. The bacon they placed in the drink was fatty and undercooked. We immediately all switched to mimosas after the $3 upcharge of yuck. The mimosas weren't anything special but at least they did the job. They were served in plastic glasses they had seen better days. I had an empty glass for maybe a maximum of five minutes at one point. Our waitress Joyce (I think that was her name), was PHENOMENAL. She was running around like crazy making sure all 20 of us had exactly what we needed, we were all really thankful for her. It was difficult to pick out an entree as many of the options were super heavy, almost New Orleans style food. Mac and Cheese, Shrimp n Grits, Deep South Eggs and sides, Burgers, Matzo Brie, Pancakes, etc. When you're boozing like we were, you don't want something super heavy, especially when you plan to head out afterwards. I found something I could work with, omelette with spinach mushrooms and sheep milk cheese which was accompanied with home fries. I should have gotten the burger, or the huevos rancheros. Actually, I should/could have gotten anything else offered and it probably would have been better than my food. It was horrible. The potatoes on the side were overcooked and tasteless, the omelette was worse. It was SO dry, definitely made with a liquid egg batter, a little hard in places and the contents inside were worse. The mushrooms were so incredibly tough and chewy I had to push them to the side. My friends enjoyed their food for the most part so overall the verdict was A-OK, just not for me. Rumor has it the fries were amazing. Food took forever and then some to come out too. Our server really made all the difference in my feelings towards this place. Drinks were bad, food was bad, but she was great and attentive and even when the all you can drink brunch had ended, she came over to all of us and topped off our mimosas. We really appreciated it. Good company, and great service can really alter one's opinion about a place and it did so for me, however I would be very inclined to check out a different brunch place in the future. Get a bathroom upstairs. Do you know the struggle of sitting for 3 hours, participating in unlimited alcoholic beverages and then having to walk down massive stairs to use the restroom. It's a challenge.",2,2,1,Samantha S.,"Huntington, NY",1444,1211,1080

The chef's mezze had nicely deep fried falafel balls and a pretty good babaganoush. The pork tacos, while a bit pricey, were good. Nice and tender and sauced nicely.For my main, I had the dayboat scallops over risotto. The risotto had mascarpone in it, so it was a little cheesy, but not overwhelmingly so. The scallops were great, though there were just a few of them. I wouldn't pay the full price ($25) for the entree, but I do love me some scallops.All in all, it was a pretty good experience.

They said they wouldn't take reservations but that it wasn't that busy and we could walk in. We arrived about 20 minutes later and the place was packed. I was worried we would have to wait, but the hostess was able to seat us right away (lucky, because I was about to gnaw my arm off).I ordered the Louisiana Shrimp 'n Grits, then right away changed to The Southern. My order was mixed up and I got The Deep South (which came with chicken-fried steak instead of sausage). I told the waitress it was no big deal, and ate that instead. It was fine (my boyfriend's burger was better), but she must have felt bad about mixing up my order because she served me wayy more than the 3 mimosas that came with my meal. Between me and my friend downing them, she probably gave us another 4 or 5 mimosas at no extra charge.Overall, food was decent and the drink service was great.

The employee who picked up the phone would barley let me tell him what i was call for before rushing me. I asked for a table on Saturday for about 2pm he informed me that they where full and there earliest availability was 4pm which would not work for me at all. He advised me to make the reservation and to call on Friday because they may have some cancellations. So i call the following day to see if there where any opening and was again rushed on the phone and I asked to cancel as they did not have the time I needed, the quickly hung up one me before I can clarify with them, but i let it go cause they where so rude. I wake up Sunday morning to a $130 charge from them! So i call and speak to a young lady who explains that they charge $130 if no one shows up for the reservation. I inform her that I did in fact cancel. she said i should have gotten a email conformation and and it would have explained the $130 for no shows, i explain to her i was never informed this and i was not asked for a email address. She then add that you have to cancel with in 48 hours of your reservation... How can i cancel a reservation that was made under 48 hours. Had i known they where going to charge my card $130 i would have never made the reservation in the first place as it was just a back up reservation. I find there process very misleading and it seems they need a full time reservation specialist who can give the full information. I will never attempt to eat at this restaurant simply because of the underhanded process.  I am still trying to get in touch with a manager who seems to only be in the restaurant for mon - fri dinner.

3.0,1/22/2015,"This review has nothing to do with the waiter, but more so to do with management. Mo, our waiter was OUTSTANDING! He handled a group of 28 people essentially by himself with barely any hiccups - none of the mistakes were his, but the kitchen and managements. I hosted my wife's 30th birthday dinner here last Sat night. We did the pri fix meal with open bar. Drinks were plentiful and the food was pretty delicious. Some people complained about cold dishes, but all and all everyone seemed happy. Great job, Mo!Now onto management. I booked the reservation with one person who was extremely nice and made the initial process very easy. Then came the hard part... First I call to leave my credit card information with the hostess as I was asked to do. One day later I receive a phone call asking me to provide my CC info. I'm like, hmmmm that's a bit disheartening. I literally did this yesterday. The person said sorry and hung up. Then 45 mins later I get a call from someone else asking the same thing. I told them the same thing and they told me they'd look into it. Then 24 hours later I get a call from another person asking me for the same thing. Obviously at this point I'm a bit worried... So I decide it's prob a perfect time to go over what I paid for to make sure they have it right. They didn't. I had originally planned to add desserts to the deal. When I spoke to the person on the phone, they had no clue. So they ""added it"".... Sure enough when I arrived there was no dessert added to the deal - in fact they didn't even have enough dessert to offer. Mind you this is for a 30TH BIRTHDAY as I had explained roughly five times. Also during the planning they said that they could fit up to 33 people in our section....umm yeah, never. We had 28 and it was a tight squeeze - no one could get in or out of their seats.

4.0,1/12/2015,"Saturday morning and I am in desperate need of some brunch. So the bestie and I head to Essex. Inside, the place looks like a converted warehouse (tall ceilings exposed brick and PVC pipes). The walls are interestingly decorated with hundreds of baseballs. Like, they are just all glued or nailed to the wall somehow. It's pretty cool.The restaurant is attached to Essex market, which is pretty neat, as when you sit on the top floor, you can peer into the market place next door from a window that connect the two.The staff consists of polite, trendy looking young people. Think blunt bangs and red lips. The crowd consists of young professionals and people in their early 30's on OK Cupid dates. How do I know? I just know. Excerpt from conversation nearby ""Your eyes look greener in person"". :)Food:I ordered:Tender lox, Potato cakes, 2 poached eggs. Topped with salmon roe and a dollop of sour cream served on a bed of spinach. It was really good and fresh. I thought it could have used some kind of heat though. Hot sauce? I don't know, it could be the Southern in me. Beverage: Mimosa. Pretty good mimosas and guess what? With the brunch special ($25) you get 3 mimosas! Which I think is an excellent deal. Also, according to my friend who is a regular, it's actually unlimited mimosas as they don't really keep track. But I wouldn't know, because I was DONE after two and a half glasses. #lightweight.All in all, I'd say give it a try!

Also, I'm not usually a fan of fried foods (*gasp*) but my group shared the fried calamari and it was really good - not ""too"" fried such that you couldn't taste the calamari. There was one dish, a potato pancake appetizer, that we collectively weren't thrilled with but, all in all, a great place. The ambiance was very upbeat and fun until about 11pm when it turned into a club-like scene and I was outta there! Last point, the service was great. My group overstayed our welcome a bit at our table and our waiter offered us each a free drink at the bar so that we'd open it up for the next party.

4.0,1/10/2015,This brunch was great! I got the chocolate chip banana pancakes which were really thick and so good! Their fries are also arguably the best fries with the perfect amount of crunch and salt. Having three mimosas included in the meal price of $25 was also a plus. The only reason I didn't give it five stars is because they kept filling up our drinks when they were half full so it was hard to know if we really got three drinks. I would also recommend doing reservations or getting there early. Either way be sure to show up with your whole group because you'll have to wait till everyone gets there anyway.,0,0,0,Caitlin D.,"New York, NY",170,106,108

2.0,1/2/2015,"Feel like this is one of the most average brunch spots I have dined at (purely speaking from the point of view of food quality). In terms of the dining experience as a whole, this place has its perks. The cool twist is that it looks like a grungey, run-down place from the outside but once you step inside you are instantly met with a trendy take on decor.The one negative regarding the dining experience as a whole is how loud it can get during peak morning brunch hours. It makes it hard to converse with a larger group of people.Now, speaking to food...-Starter Bread: Tasted like it was bought from Costco in the bulk section.Vegan Mexican Matzo Brei: Probably my favorite dish that I tried, though I didn't particularly love it. The tortilla crisps added a nice crunch to the otherwise ""goopy"" texture of the scrambled eggs...and the black beans/pico de gallo mixture were also quite tasty. Overall, nothing standout, and I feel like any other amateur chef could make a similar dish.-Chocolate Banana Pancakes: Looked extremely unappealing when it arrived at our table. It was massive-- stuffed with chocolate and banana. The texture of the inside was good-- chewy and more on the fluffy side, but again...nothing standout. -Omelet: Normal omelet. Could be made by a college student in a dorm room.It ends up feeling pricier than you would have liked because of the automatic ""all you can drink"" set price that is attached to your order. I would not come back here, just because I feel like it has nothing special to offer and that I can find better brunch food....well practically anywhere else.",0,0,0,Roopa S.,"Manhattan, NY",212,519,314
4.0,12/29/2014,"My friends and I came here for brunch on a Sunday and lucky us, we were seated almost immediately compared to larger groups who had a longer waiting period.We were seated upstairs and I'm sure it was a two person table but they added an extra seat to accommodate our number, which we were fine with. The brunch menu is $24.95 for three drinks, mimosa, screw driver or bloody mary. I ordered The Deep South and it was delicious!! My eggs were really nicely cooked and the chicken steak was sooo good. I also found the service rather nice here, we were given the old menu (they had just changed menus that morning apparently) and my friend ordered something that was removed from the menu but they said they'll still make her meal for her. Which I found sweet when they could've just asked her to choose something else. The music here was also on point, rather upbeat and being seated upstairs you can see the entire restaurant bustle about and it helped the mood. For the drinks, they pretty much refill it when you're out or when you ask for them to. You can also change out your drink if you decide you want to try something new. I'm guessing because it was during busy hours during brunch we were given the bill before I had finished (my friends both finished first) and were given free drink tickets down at the bar.

I ordered a vegan tofu scramble which was delicious - it had tofu, avacado, tortilla chips and beans. I added hot sauce for more flavor. The mimosas and screwdrivers were really good but I was not a fan of their bloody mary (too much vodka for my taste). I also tried the pancakes which were very fluffy!

2.0,12/28/2014,"Ok so my husband made reservations for my birthday dinner here on Open Table and said it was a breeze. When we arrived, I was greeted with a ""Happy Birthday!"" He put in the notes that I was excited for birthday oysters, yet they did not tell us upon arrival that they had run out of oysters. They obviously got the note though because they knew it was my birthday. What was even weirder is that when we sat down and ordered drinks from our waitress she did not mention they ran out of oysters, even though this place has a happy hour special for oysters. We ordered them when she came back again to then be told that they ran out! I just feel like they should tell you when you first are seated so you don't spend time looking at the menu and deciding on something they don't have. Even weirder, when we ordered our entrees, we then found out they didn't have the lobster ravioli I was ordering. Again, why wouldn't our waitress tell us what they are out of in advance, so we don't mull over the menu, make a selection, THEN find out we can't have it?? It just seemed so backward to me. They were out of other menu items too that she didn't tell us about until after we tried to order our meals. I suggested that she tell the guests what the restaurant is out of before they order their meals and have their heart set on something from the menu that isn't available (in my case, lobster ravioli). She didn't seem happy by my suggestion, but this has never actually happened to me before. Usually when something runs out on the menu, the server tells you before you spend time looking at the menu and are ready to order. Besides that annoyance, this place was really cool inside. I liked the decor and the overall feel of the place. It looks like it's in an old warehouse or commercial space, with high ceilings and industrial looking windows. I ended up ordering a chicken and rice dish and my husband ordered scallops and risotto. I enjoyed mine but husband felt like the risotto was overcooked (mushy) and the scallops were bland. Luckily, the drinks made up for everything that this experience was lacking. They were good and strong!! I had jalapeno margaritas and husband had mango margaritas.

3.0,12/22/2014,"Let me start by explaining the perplex setup this place has. The bar is what customers first encounter rather than the hostess area which is actually located more towards the middle/back of the restaurant making it hard to check-in. Occasionally, the hostess holding the ipad would walk to the front and do her hostess duty. If not, you had to walk to the back and try to get her attention. Don't get me wrong, very friendly staff members but this set up just makes it look a bit disorganized and chaotic. Brunch is $24.95 which includes a plate and 3 drinks (mimosa, screwdriver, or bloody mary). Few observations: are you sure you are only giving 3 drinks pp or are you serving a bottomless brunch? As soon as the mimosa glass was half empty the waiter would pour more in the glass, just for mimosas. I got the screwdriver so i missed out bc I was served 1 drink at a time. I'm all for a bottomless brunch but let me know bc I was clearly misinformed. During my 2nd drink I wanted to switch to a mimosa instead but it just became complicated, so can we switch drink options through out our meal? Also, we understood that brunch ended at 4:30 when the waitress came over and started wiping down our table. We got it. But then they lit the light only at our table. ok, yes we know we have to leave soon but we were all pretty much still finishing our 3rd drink and there were still other customers surrounding our table plus the place was pretty empty by the end of brunch I doubt you were in desperate need of a table and you don't close and reopen again for dinner. So what's the rush? There are unique food options which is what caught my eye and made me come here in the first place. The food was yummy but not to die for as the pictures lead you to believe. I guess its just the dynamic of this whole restaurant service that had me a little confused. I would consider it as a brunch option with a small group of friends (4 max). Such a crowded scene makes it look like it is the brunch place to attend but you are not missing much if you don't make it here.",1,1,1,Jess G.,"New York, NY",136,142,277

The ambience in the balcony (after getting through a ridiculous throng of 20 somethings making out by the bar at 7pm) was nice. The hostess was gracious and very apologetic about our long wait and the servers were absolutely lovely.That (bald, male, looks more like a bouncer) manager though...A few of my party were late after we booked the space with 30 minimum and we were under the number at the time. The waitress told the manager the situation, which was understandable, but then instead of communicating that info to me like an adult, he presented himself as pretty irate and gave me the choices of paying for the full 30 (which we ended up doing) or putting another table or two up there. I asked him to give me five minutes to consult with my colleagues and feel the room and he looked at his watch as though I were asking him to shoulder Atlas' burden and begrudgingly agreed. I pointed out that they seated us 30 minutes late and we had to stand by the door (while one of the ladies in my party was heavily pregnant), at which point a normal restaurant would provide some sort of comp service or apology, he proceeded to yell at me since my entire party wasn't there. That's kind of beside the point - we were renting out an event space AKA for the duration of that time, we should be able to hang out there even if we weren't ready to eat a damn bite. As if all that wasn't enough, I went back downstairs to grab some people who were waiting in the front and came late and on my way back, I saw him yelling at the really sweet waitress about the 30 minimum rule.

2.0,11/9/2014,"I came here in a group of 17 people to celebrate my dear friend's birthday. My husband and I were the first to arrive for our 11am reservation and were greeted by the nice hostess who asked us to relax at the bar since they were not opened as of yet (it was around 10:45am at that time and they open at 11am) - that's cool since it was very windy and chilly outside. My first impression is that it is a very hip and trendy spot - very open in terms of space and has good lighting. Suddenly my peaceful observations were interrupted when a man who appears to be either the owner (or manager) started throwing the F-bomb and cursing up a storm at the top of his lungs at the employees about something being done incorrectly like he was Chef Gordon Ramsay. My stunned look caught the attention of the young bartender who looked at me awkwardly as it appears he was embarrassed by this man's behavior. I'm giving him the benefit of the doubt that the ""boss"" did not notice two customers sitting there in the corner before opening hours. But either way, that is a very disrespectful way to speak to anyone and it probably happens a lot since the 10 or so employees there seem to pay him no mind - as if it is just another day. However as soon as more customers started walking him, he completely changed his tune and seemed so pleasant as he asked the customers to please hang out at the bar as we wait - scary two face!We were seated shortly after our reservation upstairs and our somewhat rude waitress (who never introduced herself - appeared flustered with having such a massive party to tend to) started taking our drink orders. We did the bottomless drinks brunch which costed $34.95 (mandatory for large parties). Drinks were strong and our cups were never left empty. The food took a while to come out; about an hour and a half into our two hour limit. I ordered ""the Deep South"" which consists of chicken fried steak, 3 eggs cooked to your liking, a biscuit, and topped with sausage gravy. Massive portion alert! First off, I had no idea chicken fried steak is not chicken at all, but beef! Apparently it is synonomous with country fried steak - What?! Yeah, I had no clue and was wondering why my chicken was brown (and so was another friend who ordered the same thing!) - so obviously I'm not the only loser who does not know this. I mean, what if I am allergic to beef or if it is against my religion? Anyway the food was mediocre, definitely edible. My husband ordered the Essex burger with hand-cut fries and said his burger was too dry, but his fries were fairly good. They charge an additional $1.50 each for any toppings to want to add in the burger such as cheese, caramelized onions, jalapeños, mushrooms - EACH! Anyway, everyone else ate their food and no one seemed to make much comment about whether it was good or bad (never a good sign so I assume it is just okay). Overall the atmosphere was definitely fun with the flowing drinks and fun young crowd, but the food wasn't so good and the workers were not exactly the friendliest.

4.0,11/9/2014,"Came here on a Sunday for a bday brunch. Because we were a reserved party of 17, the brunch option was $34.95 for bottomless brunch (entree + choice of unlimited Bloody Mary, mimosa, or screwdriver for 2hrs; after 2pm I believe you can reserve for 3hrs). If less than 10ppl your option is $24.95 for an entree with three drinks included. They were super awesome to seat us without our entire party present. Our table was on the balcony at the rear of the restaurant and offered us floor to ceiling views of people traffic on Essex street. Great options to choose from on the menu but i gravitated toward the biscuit with sausage gravy served with eggs. Food arrived not to long after all 17 of us ordered and drinks were super strong!  Food was great, my sunny side up eggs were nice and runny and not overdone as one often finds in a big crowded restaurant (this place was hopping at 11am!).  Waitress was great. Service was prompt. She was so great to plate up our outside cupcakes for the bday girl without issue. Overall experience was enjoyable. Place wasn't too loud that one couldn't hear each other speak.

They didn't.There was three of us, myself, my girlfriend and a mental Filipino who she went to school with. We lucked out and got the booth.So, for starters they had an order of oysters which looked OK and an order of HOW-FRIGGING-GOOD calamari....this calamari was absolutely delicious!For the main courses my g/f had the duck, Mental had the Angus hangar steak frites and I had the burger.Duck, cooked perfectly but only comes with bok choi and this isn't changeable. But that might be some of the best quack-quack I've ever eaten.Steak, great, and with some duck fat fries...holy full coronary Batman! Anything that bad for you has got to be good! And it was!The burger - lush, moist, a delicious blend of meat, perfectly cooked to medium rare yet very warm throughout  and the toppings were super too. The only negative point I would say is that this burger is so juicy, moist and supermodel tasty is that the bun is very light and doesn't hold up to the torrent of liquid gorgeousness that your hands are going to get very familiar with. I would still order it again though!For desert my g/f had a coconut and cream cake which was so good I wanted to snort it and Mental has some kind of chocolate brownie that should probably be shipped to ISIS to calm them down a bit. I wanted a brandy but they don't stock brandy so I ordered a port...which came in a brandy glass.

I got a Mango Lava Lamp, my sister got a Mango Mojito and our friend got a Blood Orange drink - we all liked our drink. Rachel made it pretty strong but still good! We had three shots that were all recommended by Rachel. We like the sweet stuff and she definitely catered to what we wanted. She made us a Russian Prelude and a Jolly Rancher Shot.

They have this fixed brunch menu of ordering an entree and you get 2 drinks. If you get anything that's not a mimosa, they're very strict on the 2 drink limit. However if you get the mimosas, waitresses come around with pitches of mimosas that will continuously fill your drink so even though it's technically 2 drinks, if you get a mimosa, it's unlimited. I would suggest ordering 1 non-mimosa drink and then 1 mimosa (aka all the mimosas). Their screwdrivers are pretty strong too. You can definitely taste the alcohol. The restaurant itself is pretty trendy and has a lot of lighting which is nice. There's a bar right as you enter were people were just sitting and watching the World Cup game.

I recall we ordered 100 and still wanted more and they were fresh because I didn't have any bathroom troubles (Hallelujah!). The entrees are delicious, not too salty, not too bland -- just right.

Well not here, the entrees are cooked to perfection, very fresh and did I mention there's a tv at the bar?! The bathrooms are right by the door which leads me to believe those who are locals or frequent the neighborhood don't really have to dine in to use their bathrooms because they are literally right by the door. Great dinner spot for big groups. It does get a bit noisy during prime time so if you're going on a first date and you want to make conversation, this place is not it.

They told us we couldn't be seated until we were all there. A little later we found out that one of our friends couldn't make it. When my other friend arrived, I told them we were all here and they said a table for 3 is entirely different from a table for 4. They told us we had to wait again. By this time, already 15-20 min had passed. We waited another 15 min before we went up again to ask when we will be seated. They clearly forgot about us because they didn't even remember there were now 3 of us instead of 4. They told us they'll get us a table in a couple minutes. We waited another 10 min when the hostess came over and gave us tickets for free drinks while we waited. After we got drinks we waited another 10 min when the hostess came over and asked us if we were the table for 6 and she quickly realized we were only 3 (she was not the brightest crayon in the box).

This would typically be a great seat, referring to bar proximity but did not provide useful to me on this day. Infact it was a tad of a hindrance.The Shrimp and Grits sounded like a good bet for a later-day than usual hangover for food sustenance and for the most part was just that. The grits were a tad lumpy for my liking but did exhibit a flavor that I will continue to have fond memories of. Was there bacon in there?.. Three attractive sunny side up eggs topped the dish, peering up at me like a trout freshly plucked from the Three Mile Island fishing pier, yet lacked the run of the yolk which I do enjoy in my grits, bit let's not split hairs or my meal. ""Kindly remove your fork, I don't care how good looking you are"".The shrimp was not peel n eat size nor the tiny inconsequential size, which with a topping of blackened spicing worked quite well. An up-charge of $1.50 will buy you a side of jalapeno's which I had hoped would have been roasted, but still a worth while purchase.The drinks, well they were everything I had read about and more.

2.0,7/9/2014,Food was mediocre.  I had the potato pancakes which were greasy and had no flavor.  Service was good but it's a cash only brunch!

3.0,7/9/2014,"This place is okay. Came in with 3 other friends for brunch on sunday.Food were pretty decent but the restaurant doesn't have that much character. They have a fix menu for brunch in total of $23.95 that comes with 3 boozy drinks (mimosa, bloody mary or something else I forgot). I wasn't a fan of their drinks..they were pretty water down and not that good. And remember brunch = CASH ONLY - which we did not know..The food was pretty outstanding tho. I got some smoked salmon with hash potatoe dish and fish egg it was really good. and someone else got a deep fried steak and also egg Benedict. all pretty good.This place is pretty big and usually pretty easy to make reservation. We came in around noon with reservation for 4 but there were a bunch of tables still open.

2.0,7/8/2014,"I've been to Essex on two separate occasions: Open bar at night and happy hour/dinner. I was not impressed on both occasions. Open Bar: My friend ""won"" an open bar night for her and a bunch of friends. The drinks were super watered-down. I felt like I was just drinking soda all night. I understand the drinks were free, but at least give me a little something! It also got so crowded there was absolutely no room to move. Happy Hour/Dinner: Please avoid the happy hour $1 oysters. They did a terrible job at shucking the oysters. There were so many small pieces of shells in my oyster that I had to keep spitting it out. For dinner, I shared the crab cake and angus steak frites with my boyfriend. The crab cake was okay but not worth $13. The angus steak frites ($22) was drenched in sauce and was extremely difficult to chew even though I ordered medium.I don't mind paying good money for food, but honestly, the nicest thing I can say about the food at Essex is ""mehhhh.""  The drinks at happy hour were stronger than that open bar night I referenced above.TIP: Essex only accepts cash for brunch but they do take credit cards for happy hour and dinner. All in all, there are better places in New York with better deals. I will not be going back to Essex again.",0,0,0,Tiffany C.,"New York, NY",6,27,22
1.0,6/30/2014,"Should have listened to the reviews, as we usually do. Overall vibe is fine enough, and service was generally pleasant. Trendy spot to go for brunch. But:- Onion roll served when you get in is a nice touch, but would be nice and have a lot more flavor if warmed.- There should be an option to just order an entree without having to pay $24 for the special. I don't drink and my boyfriend only wanted 1 drink, so paying that much for the mediocre entree definitely was not worth it.- Speaking of the entree, we both got the Vegan Matzo Brie, which was served relatively cold. The chips were soggy, spinach was lacking and not fresh, and I got terrible food poisoning within the hour (it was all I had eaten that day) that still, 3 days later, is not fully gone.

4.0,6/30/2014,"I arrived early to meet my friend for brunch without a reservation. When I asked the hostess, she told me they would be be able to accommodate me. However, I could only be seated when my entire party was here. I knew one of my friends was running late, so that was the only frustrating experience. She did however suggest the bar, it offered open seating for brunch and included their full menu. I took up the offer and sat down at the bar. Since NY does not allow the serving of alcohol until noon on Sundays, they do offer complimentary coffee and drinks until noon. This I really enjoyed. Free coffee always helps me feel better. I ordered The Aristocrat, which came with potato pancakes, salmon gravlax, salmon caviar, and two poached eggs. Delicious, I cleaned my plate. Three drinks are included in their brunch prix fixe meal at $24 dollars. I had three screwdrivers (and was given a fourth for free). The experience was enjoyable and the atmosphere fun.

Here are the pluses: Essex has lots of natural lighting from the enormous windows, especially during brunch. The restaurant is spacious and has a high ceiling that spans two floors. We saw some of the Netherlands vs. Mexico World Cup game at the bar.However, while the ambiance was nice, the food was meh and overpriced. My friends and I went for the prix fixe brunch. I had the shrimp and avocado salad, which relied too much on the dressing. I tried a friend's blueberry pancakes, which came with too little fruit and was overcooked. Most people could probably make way yummier ones at home. Also, Essex's brunch is cash only, which makes no sense because it's a large restaurant, not a mom & pop shop.

5.0,6/29/2014,"Had an awesome brunch at Essex! It gets really crowded in the weekends, but the walk in wait was not horribly long for our party of 4. It's tucked away and doesn't seem to be located near any other restaurants, so it can be hard to find. The restaurant is located next to the market in a warehouse, so it looks like a loft with the high ceilings and the half-second floor. The space, combined with the mobs of young, hip people, mean that Essex is airy, bright, and extremely loud. Not a good place for a quiet, relaxed brunch, but great for a loud gathering of friends.The menu is pretty good, with some really great options. The Aristocrat (potato pancakes with eggs, smoked salmon and sour cream) was delicious, and the Eggs Benedict stands its own pretty well. I got the chicken cutlet with biscuits, sausage gravy and eggs, which was pretty good too - very heavy with generous portions of everything. None of this food is going to be like the *best* benidict, or the *best* biscuits and gravy, but all combined it's very good and nothing to complain about.Service was fairly prompt, and the food came out at a good rate. The brunch ostensibly comes with three drinks (at $24.95), but they are definitely not counting. The waitstaff walk around with large pitchers of mimosas, and they will refill your glass like water. The mimosas seemed pretty heavy on the champagne, but the screwdriver was mostly orange juice. The bloody mary was *extremely* peppery and spicy - not what I prefer, but definitely can see people really being into this.The staff seems to really want to turn tables, since like four people came and asked if I was done with my half eaten plate. There's a bar with TVs that was showing the world cup, which made for even more noise.Extremely crowded, and loud, but with a great space and lighting so it feels lively and not cramped. Would definitely recommend!",3,1,0,Pam C.,"Chicago, IL",870,741,1088
3.0,6/22/2014,"I came here with my girlfriends for brunch- $24 for an entree and 3 drinks. Our waiter and the staff there were very friendly and accommodating. However the actual food experience was a bit questionable. two of us had the burger (which was delish) - my only complaint about that was that cheese was considered an extra topping which was $1.50 each. Most places don't really do that. While it was annoying, it was something I could live with. One of my friends got the eggs Benedict with salmon. While eating, she found a quarter-sized shell in her food. We told the waiter who apologized profusely and then brought out another one...which STILL had eggshells in it. The waiter ended up comping her meal and gave us unlimited drinks. So the service by the waiter was def 5-star worthy. But the actual food I would give 3. I just cannot understand how a restaurant can make the same mistake twice!

For a place that is supposedly trendy and filled with mildly attractive young people, you can afford to give us actual glasses. They served the champagne in these weird, super thick glasses. It felt really cheap. The one positive thing was the food. I had the shrimp and avocado salad and it was delicious. I will say that they do not count how many mimosas or drinks you have. So that 3 drink minimum is basically how ever much you can drink while you're there. Which to be honest, isn't that long. They brought food out for 6 people in less than 10 minutes. We were pretty shocked at how fast it came out. No one really said anything about their food.

3.0,6/9/2014,"I really wish I could give this place more stars...I came here on bday for brunch. I originally had a party of 10 and it grew to 13. So thanks for accomadting I was very appreciative of that. The brunch prices of 23 and 34 with 3 drinks or unlimited and your meal included isn't a price. So the prices are reasonable. Besides the one hostess that didn't how to communicate properly the servers were decent. But the dish I ordered was meh. I ordered the shrimp and grits and everyone at the table that has had my cooking shared my shrimp and grits is far better. My grits were lumpy and little flavorless and that killed the dish and my shrimp was overcooked. Grits should be smooth and creamy and shrimp should tender. My friends that ordered the lobster mac and cheese were certainly pleased with their dish. So thats a plus. But I'd say skip ordering the shrimp and grits until they change the recipe. I was originally looking to have an atmosphere of a real brunch party, where a DJ is actually playing the lights dim, curtains or blinds are drawn kind of deal. Since they didn't have a live DJ I asked prior to actually booking the reservation if it was a party atmosphere and well...I was told "" it's party on both Saturday and Sunday""....eh wasn't the case the pre-recorded music was blah.

4.0,6/3/2014,I booked Essex for a group brunch on a Sunday with some apprehension due to some of the other reviews I'd read.  I'm happy to say that the service was actually great and would not hesitate recommending it for a group booking.  They even sat us before 2 of our group 9 arrived because one of our party had a toddler with them.The food was solid - I had the beef hash which when it arrived was not what I expected (it looked pretty unappetizing actually) but tasted good.  The atmosphere was good as the place was pretty much full even at our booking of 11.30am.  I like the fact that there is a lot of natural light because of the skylights and windows so even though it was a nice day I didn't feel like I was missing out.  Also love the affordable set menu with 3 cocktails included.Bottom line - great place to book for groups for brunch (but based on other reviews your better off with an early brunch).,3,0,0,Dan T.,"PECK SLIP, NY",13,63,130

4.0,5/23/2014,"One of my favorite brunch spots.  And I brunch.  A lot.Typically, I judge places by their food, not their atmosphere.  Not with Essex.  Their food is good, definitely better than mediocre.  But the atmosphere is ALIVE.  You absolutely must make a reservation, it is cash only, and you need to be in the mood to be around a lot of drunk and rowdy people.  But that is what a real brunch is all about, right?!There is a flat price of $25 (I think?!) which gets you food and three alcoholic beverages.  When you arrive, they give you three tickets.  I have never been charged for drinking more than three drinks, but I think they just have to do that to control things.Their ""Bloody Morty"" (which has an additional charge) is to DIE FOR if you are a bacon lover.  It has home cured bacon and home infused bacon vodka.  Need I say more?!  Their traditional Bloody Mary's and Mimosas are also fabulous.I have tried a lot of items off their menu.  I can't remember them all, but some that stick out were the ""Aristocrat"" (smoked salmon and capers over potato pancakes with poached eggs) and the ""Lobster Benedict"".  Both were really good, especially for the price.  It isn't fine dining, but it is still delicious.Let me reiterate-- the atmosphere.  High ceilings.  Loud.  Bright.  ALIVE.  That is why I love this place.  Between the flat rate (no surprises) and lively environment, it is the perfect brunch spot for a young crowd that likes good food but still wants to be... young!  So try it.  But really, make a reservation.  Then try it.  :)",1,0,0,Eva W.,"Philadelphia, PA",59,23,5

But this visit (about two years since my previous visit) really warranted a bad review. What to comment on:1. We made reservations for 3 for 11:30. When we arrived, they sat us upstairs where no one else was seated, as if we were parasites or something. Then, when we asked for a bigger table (they squeezed us three into a table for two). When we asked to be moved, they said that those tables were probably reserved for bigger parties. I'm sorry, we made reservations well in advance too. Also, the whole upper section was EMPTY!2. The waiter was very intrusive the entire time, just bringing in his hand into our meals whenever he pleased. 3. The meal itself was mediocre. Not worth the 27 dollars Mother's Day Brunch, or lack thereof. 4. The only redeeming part was the Deep South dish. That was particularly tasty. 5. Forgot to mention that you must pay for brunch in ALL CASH!!!!!6. Also, they follow the rules and don't serve alcohol for brunch before noon. Make sure you're not there till after noon if you're planning on starting your Sunday funday. Overall, it began with the poor service that put a sour taste in our mouths.

I was actually 20 minutes late to my reservation, but only had to wait 10 minutes. The place is huge, but it does get crowded with a lot of people. I could still hear the person I was with so no big points deducted for being crowded. The mimosas are bottomless so be prepared for a boozy day. The bloody marys are limited to 3 max in the prix fixe menu. The food is good - not amazingly great, but definitely good to keep returning.",0,0,0,Kathy R.,"New York, NY",65,11,8
2.0,4/7/2014,"Came here for my birthday dinner with my boyfriend and in the end, left disappointed. The night started out great and we were promptly seated for our reservation. However, it felt as time went on we were being rushed. As I'm finishing my dessert, my boyfriend and I decide to order another round of drinks. As I'm trying to enjoy my dessert they are starting to push tables together for a party. It seems that part of the party got there early and they are standing over my table watching my boyfriend and I eat. It was extremely awkward, to say the least. The waiter apologizes and tells me we need to leave because of another party. My boyfriend and I were in and out within an hour. I go downstairs and ask to speak to the manage but instead the hostess was sent over. She was extremely nice and trying to manage the situation. When I finally figure out who the manage is it turns out I saw him before when they were pushing tables together sitting down on his phone. I was outraged he could not come over and mention to us how we were being pushed out but made his waiter do it. I kept asking for the manager and he would not come over. I had to go up to him and instead of an apology he starts to yell at me and accused me of wanting him to the pay bill meanwhile, we've already paid. He tried to tell me that people are only seated for an hour to an hour and a half tops which I know is a lie because I've been to this restaurant many times with one of my good friends and we've spent hours in a booth there on a Saturday. All he could do was offer me a free dessert after I already had one. I was extremely annoyed that he just could not apologize. The food was good but the management is terrible and quite rude.

4.0,3/4/2014,I've come here a few times for brunch and once for paint nite. Overall I am a fan---the food is pretty good and the service was friendly and fast. I like coming here for brunch because you can usually get a reservation last minute----that morning or the night before----but the crowd is always good and energetic. I always get the shrimp and grits and bloody Marys (why mess with a good thing and try something new) but the other dishes always look excellent and my friend are always satisfied with their food and their portions. My only qualms with the food have been when they forgot to omit the bacon in my grits and when my friends order was covered in hair. When this happened both dishes were quickly replaced but the hair incident was pretty disgusting. She also ordered a dish with shrimp and it looked like they had dropped one of her shrimp on the kitchen floor and picked it up and put it back on the plate. It wasn't just one hair it was a clump and there was some other debris on it. The waitress was horrified and comped her meal as well as gave us an extra drink for free. I really appreciated the professionalism but it seems like the kitchen has its problems. Other notes about this place---space is pretty tight especially on the upper levels however this is not unusual for NYC so its almost a moot point. Overall I enjoy the food and drinks at this establishment and have always had good service.

Our waiter hands us our menus and told us we had two minutes to decide. Thank you, Big Ben. We placed our orders and had about 3 mimosas overfilled by the buss boy before we could flag anyone down for napkins to wipe up the mess. Not the kind of service I prefer when dining out-even on a crowded weekend morning. The food was really yummy. I had the French toast and could have easily eaten 2 more pieces. My boyfriend had the crab egg Benedict which he also really enjoyed. The bread they give you prior to your meal is really delicious.

1.0,2/24/2014,"From start to finish our experience was an absolute train wreck. The hostess claimed that they were cleaning our table as our group was arriving. Little did we know that the party that had supposedly already left was still occupying the table. When we had brought the subject up to the hostess (after asking the to see a manager multiple times), she proceeded to laugh in our face as if our 45 minute wait was funny.  During our wait, I had a tough time understanding the male bartender's unbelievable sense of entitlement - rude, inattentive and borderline disrespectful. After finally being seated, there seemed to be another 20 minute wait for utensils and water. We unfortunately chose the price fixed menu. For the 60 bucks plus tax, you're better off spending the money and going to a nice steakhouse and having a proper dinner....or saving your money and eating at a 99 cent pizza stand. My pork belly tacos were minuscule and I'm still debating if what I ate was actually pork belly. About 90 percent of our party chose the hanger steak with French fries as their entree and I can guarantee that 100% of them wish they never had. Everyone's steak was totally undercooked and mine personally felt like it was hand delivered straight from the freezer.

1.0,2/20/2014,Essex brunch used to be a really great spot for weekend brunch but my last two times there I have been very disappointed.  They had brunch on President's Day this year and since my friends and I had the day off from work we decided to go.  My friend and I really wanted the bagel and lox platter and were really looking forward to it since the last time we came they ran out of it.  When we got there they didn't have that as an option on the menu for President's Day which was very disappointing.  As an alternative we decided on the Aristocrat--which has the smoked salmon we have been craving. When we placed our order with the waitress she informed us that the Aristocrat as well as THREE other menu choices were no longer available as they had run out of the ingredients.  I really wanted smoked salmon that day but I settled with a really crappy eggs benedict with a stale English muffin.  My question is that if you know you are going to serve brunch an extra day other than the typical weekend; why wouldn't you make sure you had enough food to cover that day?  This happened the time before this trip; they ran out of smoked salmon too!  This is a brunch place in the LES; why are they not stocked with lox for their weekend brunch?I am definitely NOT coming back!,0,0,0,Adam C.,"Manhattan, NY",33,13,0

4.0,2/17/2014,"Let's be honest, Essex may not be the best place for delicious brunch food, but it certainly gets serious points for having a reasonably priced boozie brunch menu (under $25). The food isn't bad at all and the selection of offerings they have is great, but it could be better.As for my order, I got the Aristocrat -- salmon gravlax, salmon caviar, poached eggs and sour cream on top of potato pancakes. Sounds delicious and fancy right? It was actually a decent dish, but felt it lacked seasoning overall. I definitely thought the poached eggs (cooked perfectly) could have used some Hollandaise sauce to tie in the entire dish. Also, I thought they could have simply done more with the sour cream by mixing in some chives or dill rather than just plain sour cream. Lastly, I thought the potato pancake was a bit on the dry/over cooked side, and it reminded me more of a hash brown than a pancake. As for the drinks, the mimosas were great and non-stop. That in itself made up for everything. I really wouldn't mind coming back to Essex for another boozie brunch, because like I said, the food isn't bad and the drinks that come with it are on point.The Aristocrat - 3.5/5",3,3,3,Luigi C.,"Manhattan, NY",510,303,311

The waitress kept trying to take plates that were clearly still being eaten. We had one drink and as soon as we finished eating, we were told we couldn't stay at the table (we'd been seated less than an hour). The incredibly unprofessional waitress counted the top in front of us and gave us a dirty look. I almost always over tip. If she'd been more concerned about service and less about getting rid of us so she can get another party to pay her the flat rate, her tip would've been ample. We were forced to join everyone else who had been kicked out of their tables at the bar. The bartender seemed to be in over his head as well.

They were able to have bottle service, which my classmates all enjoyed, as well as giving each of us a free drink ticket. So, it was really awesome and they were able to accommodate a big group of about 25 of us. By looking around, it seemed like there were a ton of parties there as well, and there was space for everyone. Essex has a pretty large space, as well as 2 balcony-type lounge areas on either side of their bar. They play music but it's not really a dance place, just FYI.Also, the cupcakes they served for my friend were AWESOME--so soft and moist! Ahhh.

Mimosas were nice and somewhat strong and only $4 which is a treat (yea... I think $4 is cheap for a mimosa). I had a look at the menu and it seemed edible.

It claimed there would be a free premium cocktails for my guests, access to a V.I.P lounge, cupcakes, and a four hundred dollar bottle of vodka. My guests did get in for free. I was told that ""there is no guarantee your guests will sit together."" We had to push two tables together ourselves. When all of my guests arrived the man,  seemingly in charge said, ""Can I help you?"" I informed him that all my guests arrived and he said, ""That's like six people."" Luckily, the rest of my guests came to greet me there. He then said, ""Fine, bring them the bottle."" It looked like a twenty five dollar one from the liquor store. There were only a few cupcakes for fifteen people.

Perfect. We arrive and suddenly we're told it's 10 more minutes...then 20 more minutes...then ""you're next."" All the while the entirety of those waiting when we arrived, and more importantly those who arrived after us, were all seated. Upon every check with the confused hostess, she couldn't remember if we were a party of 3 or 4, essentially elongating the wait. Her unapologetic attitude on top of inefficiency in securing a satisfying experience truly shows how poorly run this place is. Don't waste your time coming here.

2.0,1/1/2014,"First of all, we walked in and the decor of this place looked like a spoof of American Psycho -- like maybe they haven't updated the place in about 22 years? However, there's no accounting for taste, I guess, and we could have absolutely forgiven the decor if the food had been decent. It was not. I ordered the ""famous"" potato pancakes with black bean, spinach, and shitake hash. First, let me say that it is unconscionable to mix together a few disparate ingredients and call it a ""hash."" And whatever apple-honey sauce came with the potato pancakes was actually curdling on my plate. My girlfriend ordered the mexican egg dish, and while it was preferable to whatever was happening on my plate, it was still pretty awful -- eggs and gobs of cheese mixed with chunks of tortilla chips that got progressively soggier as we sat there.Our server, however, was very attentive and on point. And the ""three"" mimosas that come with brunch are served from pitchers, and it didn't seem like anybody was keeping track.

3.0,12/20/2013,"I was here on a Thursday night with a couple of girlfriends around 7, which left us one hour to enjoy as many half-off cocktails we could down before Happy Hour was over at 8pm! My favorite was the Expresso Martini which was pretty sweet-tasting for a drink made with actual expresso (but the combination of caffeine and alcohol will get you WIRED, much like drinking a 4Loko!)The only vegan entree I could see was the Potato Cake Napoleon which was two of their famous potato pancakes layered with a saute of mushrooms, spinach, and asparagus in yummy truffle oil. The waitress did mention that they don't separate the oil for different plates, but I personally don't care, and it's honestly pretty impossible to be that strict when you're eating out. My friends loved the ceviche which came in a big metal martini glass with their homemade chips. I also tried some of the shoestring fries that came with a friend's steak dish but they were nothing special.There are two balconies across from each other which creates some separation in the eating area and is probably useful for noise mitigation on days when this place is more crowded.

2.0,11/19/2013,"** Disclaimer: This review is for the nightlife/bar aspect of this establishment **I attended a birthday bottle service event at Essex on a Saturday night. I'm not sure about the details of how she got this deal but with the bottle service, we also got a one hour open bar from 11-12am. Wristband is needed so there is a guestlist assigned.My rating is based primarily on service which was horrendous. Let's start with the hostess, our first contact. Where is the service with a smile? I know i know, it's a busy night and there are probably a lot of obnoxious people around her but really, you are at a hostess at a bar on a Saturday night. That should already be expected. AND it wasn't only the grumpy cat face but she presented unfriendly service throughout the night. I saw how she interacted with other customers and she showed the same lackluster service.Now onto the Bottle Service waitress. We didn't have to deal with her much as we actually had to order the bottle at the bar... but with that said, she came and delivered the bottle in a hurry and was gone. There was no greeting and I don't think she even knew who was hosting... but anyway, there goes the mandatory 20% tip. Let's continue with this tipping business. There were 2 bartenders in service that night. One female and a bald male (who later I found out was possibly the manager). The female bartender was accommodating and provided quick service. It was still part of the one hour open bar, so my friend and I flashed our bracelets and gave her a $5 tip for our two drinks. Yes, it's not a crazy large tip but in NY where customary is $1/drink, I think we were more than fair in our tip. Let's fast forward 10-15 minutes (it is open bar and we wanted to get as many drinks in, let's be real here...). We approached the male bartender this time. I had ordered a jack and coke previously and they did indeed pour in jack daniels so they had this included in the open bar. So my friend decided to ask what kind of vodka is included in the open bar. The bartender replied grey goose. C'mon, who wouldn't get excited hearing that?! So we ordered a jack and coke which he made correctly, and goose with soda, which he poured in some house alcohol. He pushes it our direction and rightfully so, my friend and i gave eachother a weird look. He then says and I quote ""No tip?! OK! Don't expect service here"" and proceeds to walk away. My friend and I were like, WTF just happened especially since we were holding another $5 bill unseen by the bartender. He comes around a few seconds later because we were conveniently located by the ice and I tell him that we were just confused because he said he would be using grey goose. And he says, ""how do you expect to get grey goose when you don't tip"". Needless to complain any longer, he did not even give us the opportunity to tip. He was straight up rude who expected tip for not providing proper service. We would have tipped him regardless if it wasn't grey but don't say it's included and give us house vodka. It still confuses me but what I am certain of is that if he is indeed a manager, he will most likely run the nightlife of Essex down. His staff looked miserable and if I worked with a person with the likes of his, I also would hate being at work.To end on a good note, at least the horrendous service was *consistent* right?",0,0,0,Melody N.,"QUEENS VILLAGE, NY",229,28,11

I hate coming here because it's a total (as Lu H. said) ""sceney"" place - but I love coming here because the food is consistently amazing. Plus, they don't actually count how many mimosas you're drinking - so it's a totally boozy brunch (which is a requirement for any brunch I go to). Definitely make a reservation before coming here - because even with the reservation, you're in for a wait. Luckily, their brunches are served until 8pm on Sundays, so it's all good as long as you get here. And remember to bring cash - brunch is cash only!!The lovely Miss Kerry P & I came here as a ""welcome to NYC Kerry/great to finally meet you in person"" brunch - and I'm so glad we did. Good food + good company = good time. I got the Aristocrat & she got the shrimp & grits. The Aristocrat is absolutely delicious - it had everything I loved for breakfast on one plate: smoked salmon, hash browns (which they call potato pancakes*), poached eggs & sour cream. Kerry's shrimp and grits looked awesome too... until the girls at the table next to us got biscuits on their shrimp & grits and Kerry didn't. That wasn't cool. Plus, my mimosa kept getting refilled faster than her bloody mary - so much faster that she decided to switch after her first glass. And another note - they tend to switch to plastic cups (think picnics or cheap frat houses that can't afford the red cups) when brunch gets busy, so your drink (especially your bloody mary) will seriously downsize. Stick with the mimosas.Overall, a fun brunch experience - and perfect for a late-ish brunch.

Oh wait they actually just took the food and nuked it. To be all the way clear they brought back nuked Mac and cheese meaning that the cheese was oily and not existent. My medium rare steak came back medium well suspiciously. Better yet, they gave us the exact same sausage we had already tried just reheated --on a grill--so burnt with bite marks included.

The food, when done right is normally great, but every once in a while it's off ( last time my potato latkes were kinda burnt and dry and my poached eggs were cooked solid). I guess the brunch at Essex is like the little girl in the nursery rhyme: ""When she was good she was very very good, but when she was bad she was horrid."" Still, bottomless mimosas, guys. The Aristocrat is good, so is the French Toast, so is the shiitake mushroom/black-bean and apple dish with the potato latkes. Give Essex a try, they USUALLY don't disappoint. The waitresses are normally sweet too. Only con past the long wait and sometimey food? The snooty hostesses.  I'm thinking of one in particular. Girl you work at a ""just pretty good"" restaurant on the LES, not at Chip's or Le Bernardin.

3.0,9/5/2013,"Visited Essex with a party of 15+ ladies for a pre-bachelorette party brunch.  The section we were in was a private ""party room""- I'd describe it more like a loft- that overlooked the restaurant.  It was cool to have the space all to ourselves.  How their brunch menu works is that its a prix fixe (we paid approx. $30 a person- I believe it's less if you aren't in the party room) and includes an entree and three adult beverages (bloody mary, mimosa or screwdriver).  Based solely on that, it's a pretty good deal.  Especially when you are with a large group- makes splitting the bill super easy.I wasn't counting, but I'm pretty sure I drank more than my three alloted mimosas.  Well, I couldn't count because I was getting DRUNK off said mimosas.  The waitress kept coming around with a pitcher of mimosas and topping everyone off.  Now, we did notice the champagne to orange juice ratio decreased as the meal went on, but my liver is probably thanking them for that right now.For my entree, I ordered the ""famous"" potato pancakes, that came with a homemade creamy applesauce and a spinach-black bean-mushroom hash.  This is where Essex began to lose stars.  I liked the applesauce (and plan to attempt to recreate it for Hannukah this year) but the potato pancakes were way too fried.  And the hash had a lot of potential but wasn't properly seasoned.  And the food was pretty cold by the time I ate it.  Now I totally understand that it's difficult to get 15+ meals out at once.  But don't rent out a party room (and charge extra per meal for it) if you don't have the capabilities to get a majority of the food out at one time. Overall, I liked Essex- it was convenient to get to (right next to the Delancey Essex subway stop), the atmosphere was comfortable but hip, service was good, and the prix fixe brunch was a good deal.  I'd suggest coming with a maximum of 4 or 5 people to get the best experience for a perfect boozy brunch.",0,0,1,Jill L.,"Philadelphia, PA",182,339,6

I really did not want to eat it but since my friend had invited me & I did. IT was really as unappetizing as it looked. It's pretty upsetting for patrons to go out to a place for a nice meal & be so let down by the quality of the food, especially when it is so very overpriced (labor day weekend brunch was a mandatory fixed price of something like $23 for a dish & 3 drinks [didn't even want those drinks]). My friend's egg dish looked ever so  slightly more palatable but honestly it was like bad diner food. I might be able to let one bad meal pass but it was the aggressive, flippant waitress that really convinced me to  never go back.

Especially when your first cocktail of the evening hits you a little too hard as it totally did for me. They even refilled that glorious bread basket. We split a half dozen oysters. All $1 fresh oysters with lemon and the usual accutrements that come with oysters on ice. I tried one and it was okay. I'm not the biggest fan of them in the first place and then one of my friends pointed at another oyster and just stopped and stared. The frigging thing was MOVING. A little tendril I kid you not slithered out of the shell and proceeded to squiggle around. I'm kind of mortified. I was mortified. She was mortified. We asked the waitress if she could take back the one oyster and then she asked if we wanted it replaced. Well, duh. Yeah. But a preferably more dead one.

As for the booze the mimosa was warm and tasteless (hum I am sensing a theme) Oh and then there is the ""cash only"" policy.

5.0,7/8/2013,"Came here for happy hour and dinner with a few friends. Wasn't too crowded and my friends had no problem getting seated right away, even though half our party was late. Throughout the evening the waitress was fantastic- not hovering but always around when we needed her. She was super understanding and accommodating when we asked to split the tab as well.Delicious drinks and pretty strong too! My friends all got second rounds of the lava lamp- tasty but a bit too sweet for my taste (I recommend the pear mojito, so refreshing). They have a great happy hour meal special: $30 for an app, entree, and drink. I had the ceviche which was great, though a bit too spicy. Scallop risotto for the entree which was delicious! My friends had the mac and cheese and potato pancake entree- again everything was super tasty! Would happily return.Also they had a cool painting and wine class going on upstairs while we dined!

4.0,7/6/2013,"The best part about this place is that it says you get three drinks with your brunch but from what I could see they will just continue to refill your drink until you leave. We probably got more like 4-5 mimosas. We left right after we paid our bill though so we didn't overstay our welcome. Also, they're not ripping you off on the drinks. It was mostly booze with a splash of juice. I had the tofu scramble. It was fine, but didn't blow my mind. I could make a better one at home. But overall no complaints since it was a decent vegan option right on the menu. Other vegan tips: They have tempeh bacon. They have a vegan burger but not a vegan bun (the nice, knowledgeable, waitress alerted me to this, so bonus points!). The rolls that they give you when you sit down are not vegan. My friend had the (non-vegan) pancakes and liked them. Other: We had a reservation and had to wait about 15 minutes. The place was pretty packed but it wasn't terrible.

Honestly, I could've prepared a better brunch than this place.There's a good selection of food and drinks available, but they're just NOT tasty! It was flavorless, bland, and COLD! The iced tea my friend ordered in lieu of a Bloody Mary was actually bitter. I ended up ordering an iced coffee. You're pretty much out of luck if you don't drink because the Brunch Special gives you three alcoholic beverages (past noon thanks to NYC laws) with your meal.The service was just okay.. there are lots of servers hanging around.

5.0,6/8/2013,"I went to a Sunday Brunch here and it was fantastic! The crowd here is very L.A. despite the fact that it's in NY - the hipsters, sorority girls and celebrities only in their head. I actually arrived a little late (oh, subway!!) but the other half of our party had been waiting for 30 minutes already. The place was beyond packed. We waited a little longer, maybe 15 more minutes and were finally seated in the upstairs section. Despite the initial wait once we were seated the service was really quick once we got to our table. They do pack everyone in so it's pretty much like sitting at one big table. Don't talk about anything you wouldn't want the party 6 inches away to hear.Anyway, the food: Ordered the $23.95 brunch special. We were only supposed to receive 3 complimentary mimosas but the waitress kept refilling our glasses which was just fine with me! It's your standard cheap champagne + OJ restaurant mimosa but after 10 you're feeling pretty great. For food I had the Crabcake Benedict which was phenomenal! They definitely take more care in preparing the food than the cocktails but overall it's a really great place to grab a bite for a reasonable price.",0,0,0,Jamilia D.,"Los Angeles, CA",3,18,0
1.0,6/2/2013,I would love to say. Loved the food but instead I never tasted it. The bar was hot and loud and crowded.  Reminded me of a college dive around happy hour drinks were decent but we should have known that something was up when they offered us a free one while we waited because the wait list was actually twice as long and the hostess had the I'll attitude.

3.0,5/28/2013,"This review is for their brunch. Came here for brunch on Memorial Day mainly because we stopped by Clinton St Baking Co and the wait was going to be 1.5 hours. We figured we would be seated and eating at Essex by that time so we drove over just in time for their opening at 11 AM.The ambiance was pretty nice, there is a full bar by the entrance, high ceilings and two levels. We were seated upstairs by the window, it was cute and well lit, perfect for brunch. Their menu for brunch consists of an entree along with 3 glasses of either Bloody Mary, screwdrivers, or mimosa for $23 (with several entree options which required a supplementary fee). I opted for the mimosa and watched as they made it. They did not skimp on the alcohol! The drink was bubbly deliciousness not too strong, just right for my liking. My bf had a screwdriver, which he said tasted like cheap vodka. Kinda figures, I mean 3 glasses free with your meal, how much can you really ask for. For the entree, I ordered the Lobster Benedict (they charge 3$ extra for that option as well as the crab cake Benedict) I've been craving succulent lobster meat Benedict since I fell in love with the one I had a Clinton St the week before (such a shame it was just a limited time special for that week). However I was a little disappointed at the one I had here probably because I had high hopes after reading the great reviews on it. Their lobster pieces were in such little bitty pieces and wasn't flavorful. The eggs were poached pretty well, but the English muffin was a little on the hard/chewy side for my liking.  The potatoes that came with my dish was pretty good but the salad was nothing special. My boyfriend ordered the aristocrat - salmon with salmon caviar on top of a potato pancake served along with two poached eggs. Reminded me of a deconstructed Salmon Eggs Benedict served atop potato pancake rather than english muffin... GENIUS! The potato pancake was soo good and crispy and went perfectly with the salmon. I will probably order that next time as opposed to my lobster Benedict.  The service here was ok. Will I be back? Probably not anytime too soon for brunch, maybe when I am in the mood for some more of their aristocrat with several glasses of bubblies. However, I have been dying to come here for HH one day and try their oysters!",0,0,0,Monica C.,"Brooklyn, NY",319,101,139

But our food took 40 minutes, and it still didn't arrive at our table and we were all oyster-ed out already. What was our nonchalant rude waitress' excuse?

5.0,5/15/2013,"VENUE: It's barely noon when we arrive at Essex Restaurant for brunch. Even with a reservation, we found ourselves crammed like sardines near the entrance, waiting for a table. Turns out by New York state law, alcoholic beverages cannot be served prior to noon on Sundays. Normally that wouldn't be a problem for most brunch spots, but at Essex, the alcohol is every bit as important as the breakfast fare itself. I am going to remember this establishment by the amount of alcohol that moves through the bar. Watching the bar for just a couple minutes left me fascinated at how quickly the champagne, vodka. and orange juice on the shelf was depleting. It's not until I saw a menu that it all made reasonable sense. ""$22.95 Weekend brunch includes 3 Bloody Mary's Mimosas or Screwdrivers"". Clearly the folks at Essex aren't joking around about doing brunch the right way. FOOD & DRINK: The Aristocrat ($22.95, includes 3 drinks)- Potato pancakes, House-cured smoked salmon gravlax, Salmon caviar, Sour cream, Poached eggsI've never been a big brunch fan, but this Aristocrat could just about convert me. The poached egg was perfectly cooked, and those potato pancakes were TO DIE FOR. Having 3 tall glasses of bubbly mimosas to wash it down was the cherry on top!Essex Mimosa ($4 or free with a brunch order)These aren't your typical complimentary brunch mimosas. I watched them make these at the bar, and are definitely more than equal parts juice and alcohol. Definitely not to be consumed for the empty stomach!Bloody Morty ($7) - Homemade bacon vodka and bacon garnishFor $3 more you can upgrade one of your Bloody Mary's to a Bloody Morty, which is a bacon infused Bloody Mary. It's a commonly known fact that everything tastes better with bacon (who's with me here?), so we saw no reason not to order it. And let me tell you, this ended up tasting more like bacon, than bacon itself. Very concentrated bacon vodka, with a spicy Tabasco punch at the end.THOUGHTS:Whether it be because of the food or the alcohol induced endorphins, brunch a tEssex Restaurant definitely brought an enjoyable experience!",3,0,1,Mary C.,"Richmond Hill, Canada",69,125,338

3.0,5/9/2013,"Actually wanted to try Clinton Street Baking Co, but my friends won't wake up at a normal hour (""normal"" meaning - lets get there at 9 AM)!  Went to Clinton at 2 and they weren't even taking reservations anymore (over a 3 hr wait)!  Even though I had never been there, I remembered that Essex was in the area, so my friend and I walked over for brunch.When we walked in, the front area/bar was super-crazy packed.  We had to sideways-slide and ""excuse me, excuse me"" our way to the hostess stand.  Maybe they should just put it at the front, but whatever.  We were told that it would be a 30-minute wait, so I put in my name and gave them my cell number so they could let me know when our table was ready.We walked back towards the front of the restaurant to chat and wait (the bar was completely full of loud young peeps in large groups drinking mimosas).  There were only 2 of us, so we found a good little nook.  That was until more people starting coming in and crowding around us.  I was about to elbow a ho, but I kept my temper in check and tried to just laugh it off and make fun of people with my friend.  I guess it was my fault for trying to have brunch in the tri-state area on Cinco De Mayo...Speaking of Cinco de Mayo, a 23-ish year old girl came in wearing not one, but TWO huge sombreros on her head.  She was standing behind my friend and she got about half an inch from poking him in the head with her large hats.After about 40 minutes, I decided to brave my way to the hostess stand again.  It took a while because of all the goddamned people who didn't want to move.  If it wasn't so crowded, I would have checked in at 30 minutes and 3 seconds.  I checked in with the hostess and she couldn't find my name at first.  I saw it on the 2nd of her two ipads and pointed myself out.  She said ""Is your friend here?""  Me - ""Yup, we've been here.  Just wanted to check in on the timing.""  Hostess - ""We can seat you now.""  Instead of braving the crowd again, I texted my friend to meet me on the other side of the restaurant and come up the stairs to our table (there are two balconies on the side).  I'm glad we got a little corner balcony table because the people eating on the main floor were getting bumped around.  So we sit down and I notice there are not one, not two, but THREE open tables for 2.  So basically, if I hadn't checked in, who knows how long we would have been waiting.  Sigh...So the food and service thereafter.... The brunch comes with 3 brunch cocktails.  I ordered the blueberry pancakes and my friend ordered the egg breakfast.  We both got mimosas and ordered a side of fries to share ('cause we're fatties like that).The food took a while to come out, but we were drinking and chatting and were on no kind of schedule, so it was fine.  When my pancakes came out, I got NO syrup.  After about 3 minutes, I was able to flag down the waiter to ask for it.  10 minutes go by.... I see the waiter at the stand making pitchers of mimosas.  Again, the only reason I haven't gotten up yet is because my friend would have to move for me to get by.  I'm telling myself to keep cool in my head, but that didn't work forever.  I finally ask my friend to move and walk over to the waiter.  He rolled his eyes when I asked for syrup again, but it was because he had asked one of the bus boys to get it for me and he obviously hadn't.  I was kind of pissed because to me, syrup MAKES pancakes.  I literally hadn't had a bite and my friend (eating eggs), was trying wait for me, even though I asked him not to.  Anyways - finally got the syrup and the pancakes ended up being wonderful.  They were large, so I could only eat about half.  The blueberries were baked in (not in a sauce on top), so that was a def plus.  I would totally order these again (take THAT Clinton Street and your forever wait!)  The fries were super salty, but that is exactly how we wanted them.  My friend liked his cheesy egg and bacon dish with homefries, so the food was a hit.The waiter apologized about the syrup and told us that he would give us unlimited mimosas.  I kind of think they do that anyway, but I guess the gesture of actually saying it was nice (???).  He was true to his word and kept refilling our glasses, even after we had paid the bill.  To recap - the wait was annoying because of the crowd of people around us.  Also, the hostess obviously wasn't paying attention to our reservation and I know that we could have been seated a lot earlier.  The food was good and the unlimited mimosas were a plus.  Waiting for syrup got annoying and I might have been in a shittier mood about it if I wasn't with my awesome friend with no place else to be.  Bottom line - I would like to return to Essex, but maybe go at Noon instead of 2:15/2:30 to avoid some of the louder crowds.",0,0,0,Lauren J.,"Boston, MA",17,125,108

Since we had a third entree outside of the brunch deal, our waitress charged us separately for the cheapest entree, yes!The macaroni & cheese was definitely the best dish. It was creamy and cheesy with the crispy coating. The small mixed greens salad it came with was amazing. It also came with three pieces of chicken apple sausages, which I didn't like too much.The Mexican matzo dish was interesting and pretty tasty. I just wish the tortilla chips were on the side instead of in the eggs, this way you can dip it into the guac the dish comes with. The brunch salad was... well, it was boring.

This weirded me out.--CROWDED. We had a reservation so were seated quickly, but I got the impression you would wait forever without one. --They gave us cold bread and rock-hard, just-out-of-the-fridge butter. Butter that is impossible to spread is a pet-peeve.--Our first round of drinks were brought to the table spilling over the sides and onto the table. I cleaned it up myself because the waitress was so busy she dashed off without noticing.--Our waitress literally groaned and rolled her eyes when we asked to see another menu for someone who had shown up late.

3.0,4/22/2013,"Food was a solid 4 stars, but the attitude + service lowered this baby to a 3...you hate to see that.  My boyfriend's sister was turning 21, so for the occasion she made a reservation for 10 at 9:30 pm.  At the time she made the reservation, the restaurant informed her that they charge a $20 per person fee for a cancelled reservation, which is a pretty harsh penalty, and just seemed kind of unnecessary.*  We sat down when our table was finally ready, around 10:15, and our waitress came over to take our drink order.  But we didn't have drink menus yet.  So we asked for drink menus, and got ONE for our table of TEN.  We were all in a good mood because we weren't in a rush or particularly starving, but this does not seem to be an effective way to run a restaurant.  Finally, we passed the drink menu around so everyone put their orders in, then we ordered our food.  Although most of it came out in a decent amount of time, they forgot to put in two people's orders, sadface.  Anyway, as compensation the chef sent out 4 plates of potato pancakes with lox, creme fraiche, and salmon roe.  YUM.  I would recommend getting some to share with your table, because these babies are salty, crispy, and absolutely necessary.  For my own meal, I ordered the salmon with kale and quinoa and was really happy.  I was asked how I wanted my salmon cooked, and I said medium well, but what I actually got was well-done.  Not ideal, but I should have just asked for it to be medium.  The kale was absolutely delicious, I don't know what they did to it but it was amazingly flavorful and tender.  The quinoa was similarly delicious and flavorful, and I got to feel healthy and fortified for my night of drinking...I stole a bite or two of my boyfriend's risotto with scallops and I was pretty jealous of its buttery scallops and risotto that was bursting with flavor.  He was actually complaining that there were TOO MANY scallops because of how rich it all was, but really enjoyed the dish.  I tried the Pickled Saint cocktail, which is gin, St. Germain, mint, and cucumber, and I would highly recommend it.  It's like a slightly English mojito that's super refreshing and not overwhelming.  Overall, I liked Essex, but beware that it is almost like a club with how loud the music is/how all the girls are dressed.  If you do go, be sure to bring your appetite and patience, and order the potato pancakes!       *Maybe there's some sad deposed dictator running the reservation book?",0,1,0,Maeve C.,"Brooklyn, NY",198,331,2

2.0,3/19/2013,"Ok, so I am not an amateur at this place. I've been here dozens and dozens (and dozens) of times. Not much in recent years, but it used to be a ritual with a certain segment of my friends. I've eaten at just about every table upstairs on both sides.I'm tempted to give y'all one star, and although there were a few redeeming spots, definitely not enough to get to more than two. In fact, two is generous.Here were the problems this past Sunday, 3/17/13:1. Hostess woman, white top, black jeans: you're very attractive, yes. You'd be even more attractive if you smile when a customer comes up to you. It's really not that cool to be 'cool'. You're my first point of contact and I got what seemed like attitude. I had a reservation, be pleasant. I'm about to spend my money in the restaurant you are the liaison for. SMILE AND BE NICE. Thanks. My friend who first checked in for our party also got attitude. Seriously? Greetings, 1 star.2. We had a 2:30 reservation. Our party was all collected at 2:35; we had one person cancel at the last minute from our party of four plus an infant, so there were only three of us plus an infant instead. Given the turnover, why on EARTH did it take more than 45 minutes to get seated? This is fairly gross mismanagement of reservations. Why did I even make one? Fifteen minutes is the outer limit of acceptability for these things. We stood for almost an hour with an infant. Put yourself in your customers' shoes for just a second; how would you like to be waiting that long when you had a reservation even without an infant? Table assignment seems capricious. Waiting and reservation logistics, negative 3 stars.3. I've eaten Eggs Benedict at Essex so many times, I can't even imagine how many times. This version was a dismal failure. To wit, the following:yelp.com/biz_photos/esse…If there is one cardinal sin of Eggs Benedict (and poached eggs in general), it is overcooking. Would YOU want to eat that (unless, of course, you specified that you wanted them with hard yolks)? For me, this is a disaster, but given all that happened and how long we waited, I was reticent to send them back. I ate them and sucked it up. Food experience, 1 star.4. The french fries. Seriously, what happened to those magical home fries you used to have, the ones with the onion and (I believe) tomato? They were fantastic. These were... fries. French fries with Eggs Benedict? You are not the Sunburnt Cow. FAIL. 1 star.5. Ok, those tennis balls have been on your wall for a LONG TIME. I know how it is, it's easy when you work in or own a place to not even see things that are in plain sight. Those tennis balls are disgusting; they're dusty and they should either be replaced, or removed altogether. Looking at white tennis balls caked with dust is not what you want to see in a restaurant or while you're eating. Removal would really detract from nothing, so I'd suggest it. Dirt, negative 3 stars.Bright spots:1. Hostess woman was actually fairly patient when seating us and helping my friend deal with her stroller. No smile, but patient. 3 stars.2. Our waitress was very nice, patient and poured us lots of drinks. 4 stars.3. My friend David liked his shrimp dish a lot. 4 stars.4. Another waiter gave us three free drink tickets in order to soften the blow of hastening us to free up our table. 4 stars.Add up all of the above, get 12, divide by 9 (five negative, four positive), and get 1.3333I'm being generous by moving it up to 2.Get your act together, Essex.

In addition to that, we noticed waiters trying to dodge crowds as they were running fresh food plates to customers on the other side of the restaurant. Talk about health code problem. I will never return and tell all of my friends too. Food was also bland. I got the Matze Scramble, and had to overdose it in hot sauce and pepper to add flavor. The only friend of mine that was happy with her food ordered the Eggs Benedict...I don't see this as making up for my meal, since if you screw up Eggs Benedict as a restaurant then you really know you've failed as an establishment.

In one of the hostess's defense, she was very apologetic and sweet and gave us drink tickets while we waited and made sure we had our glasses filled toward the end of our wait. I appreciated that, but still - unacceptable. That being said, I was with two good friends and we were still having fun chatting etc. so it wasn't thaat big of a deal. When we were finally seated we were served those onion rolls which were really delicious. I ordered the grilled flat-iron steak and eggs, which was fine (I know this may not have been the wisest order choice). The steak seemed to be just OK quality. It was cooked medium rare as I had requested, but it wasn't particularly flavorful. The eggs were nothing special either. I had read reviews in which it was made clear that the food at Essex is mediocre, so I was not expecting anything sensational. My friends ordered the potato pancakes and the mexican matzoh brei, which they both said they enjoyed. We drank mimosas the whole way through..the mimosas were good, although they could have re-filled us one or two more times while we were eating. I was buzzed by the end of our meal. Overall it was a fun experience despite the wait but I am not rushing back there as there are so many fun AYCD brunch spots in NYC that I have yet to try. Also- not cool that brunch is cash only.",2,0,0,Rachel L.,"Manhattan, NY",3,10,0
4.0,2/20/2013,"YUUUMMM. I came here on Presidents' Day with a group of girlfriends for some brunch. 12:15 reservation, we were seated right away and the place was pretty empty. I think it was a weird day because some people had off work while others didn't, but anyway...I don't even know where to start with this brunch - $22.95 for your entree and 3 drinks (we all had mimosas) - although it's not really 3 because they keep coming around with a mimosa PITCHER and topping off your glass. I thought pitchers of mimosa only existed in my dreams... ummm, yes please. Most of the table got the Mexican Matzo Brei, which I didn't get to try, but all the girls seemed to love it. I had the LES Matzo Brei with homemade apple sauce, and bacon instead of the chicken apple sausage that it usually comes with (they were out of it). This matzo brei was top notch - it tasted *almost* as good as my Jewish mother's, and the homemade apple sauce was to die for. The bacon was cooked just the way I like it too. The salty bacon with the tart and sweet apple sauce was magic.Surprisingly, they didn't rush us out of our table right away, and refilled our drinks 1 or 2 more times as we sat and gabbed. Around 1:30 it started to get super crowded, and eventually our waitress came over and hinted we should leave... and by hinted, I mean she gave us all free drink tickets for the bar.

4.0,2/19/2013,"For a trendy, young spirited, energetic, let loose kind of Sunday morning drink and fare devouring session, there is one place and one place only. Lower East Side's, Essex is the name in the Bloody Mary and egg game. Walking into the industrial two-story, loft style restaurant, one feels as if they've stepped foot into a metal and concrete jungle of forced fun.  I say, ""forced fun"" because at Essex, patrons receive three breakfast libations with brunch.  Choose from the spicy and simple Bloody, the ""put your game face on,"" Screwdriver, or the classic and bubbly, Mimosa.  After finally making our way up to the second floor (with a less than ideal wait even with reservations), a Bloody Mary was in order.  For two bucks extra, I upgraded my Bloody to a ""Bacon Mary,"" a very intelligent and rather obvious decision, I'd say.  Did I mention the waiters keep no track with how many drinks they've poured you?  Forced fun indeed, if you can keep up!    With a menu that requires heavy drooling on your shirt, there is something for everyone at this Jewish and Latin inspired brunch and lunch hotspot.  I ordered the special of the day: Seared Scallops served over potato pancakes and two poached eggs.  The gorgeous golden-crusted scallops cut like silk and tasted so divine with the yolk from the poached eggs and the crispy, perfectly greasy, potato pancake.  I was in pure culinary bliss.  This dish was so tasty in fact; I took almost an hour consuming it.  I wanted to really savor one of the top 10 brunches I have had to date.           My friend, Megan ordered their Crab cake Benedict.  Though she felt the egg was cooked just the way she loves it (she's a sucker for a really runny yolk), she was a bit disappointed with the crab cake.  After taking one big bite from the yolky, crabby, hollandaise madness, I understood her minor heartbreak.  Though seasoned quite well, the crab cakes were in need of some more crab and less filler.  Other than that, this Benedict was scrumptious.     Mimosa and Bloody Mary refills to my left and right, we could've chatted and chuckled in our cozy spot for hours.  Essex is a place for partying and eating simultaneously and I think that's the point.  Solid fare, exceptional service and fabulously fun ambiance exists here.  It is not where you go for romance.  It isn't even where you go for the most extravagant kind of feast.

I had heard mixed reviews about the food, but loved what I got! The vibe in there is super crowded and somewhat trendy. It's got a lot of natural light and the noise level is pretty high for a brunch place (then again, its kind of like being at a bar in the middle of the day). We sat in the upstairs area, which was cool because it has a balcony that looks onto the rest of the restaurant below. I started out with a bloody mary that was delish-- had a nice kick and lots of horse radish. Just the way I like em. I got the mexican eggs, my date got the eggs benedict. Both were very tasty. Loved their sides of potatoes and beans. We switched to mimosas, and were actually each able to squeeze 4 drinks, rather than 3, out of our waitress.

Granted everyone else in the place seemed to be enjoying themselves. perhaps it was the horrible tasting mimosas, screwdrivers, or bloodymaries that come with a $24 brunch entree. I must say the mimosas tasted REALLY BAD, but got the job done when thinking about my Blood alchohol level. I was buzzing for about a solid hour and a half. The food was ""eh"" at best. Was not impressed at all for the ""fancy/ trendy"" environment it boasts. My GF and i came rather early 11:20 ish. and seats were already filled, so we sat at the bar. Bar staff was cool and staff in general seemed decent, but i was NOT impressed to say the least. about 20 minutes later there was a line of about 10-15 ppl. early bird catches the worm i guess. Maybe im a bit biased because i prefer more of the home-ly feel to brunch spots, or at least a less rowdy diner, but honestly the quality of the food and drinks does not match the ambiance its trying to show. Im more of a regular eat and chillax type person so being in ""the new hot spot"" wasn't for me.

3.0,1/27/2013,"last time I had Essex was over 5 years ago, my sister introduced me to this place and it had been one of my favorite brunch spots, one that I held fondly in my memory for a really long time until I would one day come back and eat at this place (I only come to NY about twice every year).  Fast forward to current day, a more older, experienced me, with the savvyness of a yelper, and this place is now just an average place (food wise) to me. The atmosphere of the place is really awesome, it's in a loft-style venue, big open tall ceilings with 1st level and 2nd level seating. The energy is awesome, you definitely get the NY vibe here. Food wise I thought it was just ok. The Lobster benedict is a pretty good brunch item. The other popular dish that many people get here is the Mexican Brei, which is basically just a huge omelet w/ chorizos, something I could make at home. I don't get the hype about the potato pancakes either, I thought it was rather basic. So my once fond memory brought me back to reality that this is a good brunch place, but not amongst the better ones I have had. I do give this place props for making their mimosas/bloody mary's strong, most places skimp on that when it is included in the meal.

Once we inquired about our reservation status, we were given ""free drink tickets"" from the hostess, which was a nice gesture, except once you sit down the drinks are basically unlimited anyway.

Lots of good brunch options; I went with the chocolate chip banana pancakes. While our cups were rarely empty (with the exception of my friend who ordered a greyhound, waited 25 minutes, then received two at the same time), the amount of time that we waited for our food was RIDICULOUS- I mean over 75 minutes ridiculous. After waiting so long to sit down and ordering immediately, they was absolutely no way we should have waited this long to eat. I don't know if the waitress forgot to enter our order, if it got lost, or what, but we waited an eternity and never even got an apology. Our waitress offered to give us each 2 free drink tickets at the bar afterwards, but we weren't really interested in hanging around Essex after spending over 3 hours there (for what we thought would be a 90 minute max brunch.) One member of our party shared this with the waitress, who agreed to take 10% off our check. A nice gesture, but overall I was very disappointed after hearing how great brunch at Essex is. My food was good, but it's difficult to say if it's because I was ravenous after waiting 2 hours to eat, or if the quality of the food was actually good.

2.0,1/9/2013,"I went here once a few years ago, and seemed to remember having an enjoyable experience with good food. Unfortunately, last Sunday when I came here for brunch, I did not have the same experience. It's quite a shame that the food did not match up to the social ambience/lofty feel of the restaurant. Such a cool, unique LES spot deserves the same quality of food IMO! The last time I was here, I ordered the eggs, sunny side up, which came with a salad, fruit and roasted potatoes. First of all, I had asked for toast on the side. Apparently they don't have toast! Ummm what? They do serve brunch, right? Secondly, the egg white part of my eggs were really thick! I hadn't really ever seen anything like it. I think it made it taste more egg whitey than yolky (and we all know that the yolk is the best part!). Third, my potatoes looked so sad! and they tasted sad! They were kind of soggy and bland, not at all crispy or seasoned like I've had at oh the other hundreds of places that serve brunch in new york. My friend ordered the deep southern brunch that came with the chicken fried steak and biscuits and gravy. Now being from the south, i know my chicken fried steak AND biscuits and gravy. The biscuits and gravy were passable, at best. The chicken fried steak didn't taste anything like chicken fried steak.. again, it was just another sad piece of bland meat wasting precious space on our brunch table. and to top it all off, the orange juice in the mimosas were so watered down that it was basically like drinking water! they must get their orange juice from orangina or something. again, what a shame since this place does have arguably one of the coolest set ups for a Sunday morning brunch...",1,0,0,Van-Ann B.,"TriBeCa, Manhattan, NY",120,107,12
3.0,1/9/2013,"Was a little disappointed yesterday when we were notified that they recently changed chefs, so a lot of their old items (which we loved) were not there. The new replacements were just okay... I guess the best thing we ate tonight was the $1 raw oysters, and the ever so addicting sauces that accompanied them.The mussel dish with white wine and shallots were just okay. Mussels were bland, but the shallots were good. Sauce was just bleh. Usually my friends fight over the mussels, but tonight we had a hard time finishing them.We also ordered the filet mignon, which was just alright. The mashed potato and Brussels sprouts came out nicely. The crispy chicken with i think couscous was okay. The crispy skin on the chicken was yummy, but the couscous was flavorless.Service was great, there really wasn't much people dining there on a Tuesday night.  A little disorganized though, because different waiters keep coming to our table and asking if they can remove some plates..I will definitely be back for more oysters!",1,0,0,Tiffany C.,"New York, NY",203,314,441

1.0,12/27/2012,"We decided to eat at Essex on Christmas night since we were not able to go back home for Christmas. We made the reservation for 5 people at 7:30. We arrived early and were seated early. We enjoyed the decor and the amazing ambience. We ordered our food around 7:45ish and order more cocktails. (Lets just fast forward this story). Our food didn't arrive until 9:30. Our server, Summer, lied to us and said that they had no more bread to bring us while we waited for almost 2 hours for our food. Then said the reason the food took so long was bc the computer frozen, then backtracked and said the Internet went down, then finished up by saying it was just her fault. Needless to say, we were not happy so we called a manager over. The manager, Sue, came over and did not make the situation any better.She ended up blaming the server for everything and she said she had nothing to do with this situation. She became very loud and was waiving her fingers in our faces saying she was in the back running food so there was technically no manager for the night. Sue was very unprofessional and did not handle the situation accordingly. As a manager you should never place the blame on another employee of the restaurant... You just need to own the mistake and make the experience better. Conclusion: I doubt we will be going back to Essex to eat and we told Summer the manager had blamed her for everything and she does not deserve to work at a place like this. We told her she should start looking for a new job where management knows how to do their job and how to protect and take care of their employees.

3.0,12/25/2012,"I think the key to a great brunch is that you get to eat something you can't make at home. If I'm game for heading out on a Sunday morning, it's because I'm interested in hanging out with my girlfriend and other friends, and having great food. We had heard great things about Essex. And they took good care of us. My main gripe is that as they got busy they lost our food order, leaving us sitting there for way too long. After a while, we asked what was up, and they got our food to us quickly. And, they gave us an additional drink on the house. The best brunches are when you order something that you can't make at home.

4.0,12/23/2012,"This is a review for Saturday Brunch. I was pleasantly surprised as many of the reviews I read for brunch were that this place was a subpar boozy brunch spot. That's definitely false. I came here with a 2:30 (prime brunch time) reservation with 3 of my friends with little expectations based on the reviews I read. My group was a little late and arrived at 2:45. They won't seat you until your whole party is present, which is understandable. When the whole group had arrived, the hostess promptly seated us. The seating wasn't ideal. I mean, It is a tight space. No complaints though as the service from our waitress and the busboys immediately made up for it. The waitress promptly filled out flutes with mimosas and kept them filled for the entirety of the meal. It's basically AYCD. You can also switch between screwdrivers, mimosas and bloody marys if you so desire. The food was great as well. They have a little something for everyone on their weekend brunch menu. All in all, I would advise you to check it out for yourself and definitely make a reservation.

I had the hash over three eggs, which was just OK but the beef was kind of stringy and dry, and I don't like beef jerky in my hash, yo.Drink options are screwdrivers (for those of you who mean business), mimosas, and bloody marys. My friends said the marys were decent. Apparently Essex makes a bacon-vodka bloody mary but they were out of the infused vodka that day.

The complementary onion rolls are awesome!But good onion rolls and a nice waitress isn't why I visit a restaurant. The food was pretty average. The Deep South (chicken fried steak with eggs, sausage gravy and biscuit) was deeply disappointing and not southern at all. Crappy cut of steak, bland gravy and frozen doughy biscuit. The highlight of the dishes in my group was the Mexican Matzo Brei - scrambled eggs, with tortilla crisps, monterey jack, avocado, black beans & pico de gallo.

4.0,9/18/2012,"5 Stars for this place's consistently amazing Wednesday Night $18 lobster special. You get a healthy sized 1.25 lb lobster with fresh corn on the cob and deliciously seasoned potatoes that makes you wish you had them for breakfast. This pairs well with any of their super reasonable bottles of wine. My friends went especially nuts for the fact that happy hour prices are honored at your table until 8pm, meaning you can experiment and explore the menu of half priced cocktails (most are good - a few are hit or miss) at $5 a pop as well a good selection of $1 east coast or $2 west coast oysters. Any other night, dinner is pretty reliable though I highly recommend having a reservation, especially on the weekends. The wait staff is hit or miss occasionally being a little slow with water refills, but the bus boys are super attentive and at times guilty of pulling your plate prematurely before you've had your last bite of food.For appetizers, I really enjoyed all of the potato pancakes and salads. For mains, I recommend the baseball steak with lobster mashed potatoes or the wasabi crusted salmon or roasted duck breast. I've always been way too full to even try dessert, though they all look pretty delicious. Overall this place is great if you want a solid dinner before hitting up all the nearby bars without completely blowing your money.

3.0,9/18/2012,"Okay, so I had a reservation for a Saturday at 2:30; when we got there the place was mobbed and had to wait at least a half our to be seated.  The biggest problem I had was not the wait time, it was the fact that the hostess stand is positioned half way through the restaurant and with the crowd, you could barely get through.  Once we were seated our table was within the crowds, people were bumping into us, until about 3:30 when the crowd actually died down. I do like this place and would probably go back though because the mimosas were strong and good and the food was great and how can you beat the price! $22.95 for unlimited mimosas and a plate of brunch food?! however we were also short changed on our bill by $20.. luckily we noticed it!

3.0,7/23/2012,"The food here was amazing, but I had to deduct a star because of some of the silliness involved with this place:- $23 flat rate for brunch that includes 3 drinks: if you don't drink, like me, this is a ridiculous waste of money- cash only- close quarters force you to listen to annoying hipster/food snob conversationsNow that I got that out of the way, let's talk about the positives, which do actually far outweigh the negatives here.So yeah, for those of us that aren't alcoholic, it would be nice to be able to order items a la carte off the brunch menu without being forced to pay for drinks we don't get. I would have ordered and enjoyed much more food if I didn't have to pay all that. Sure, I get that a lot of people find this to be the most amazing deal ever since it's really cheap for all that alcohol, but what about fatties like me that just want to eat a lot of good food?OK, now really, onto the positives.To start off, for the complimentary bread you get an awesome really soft, slightly warm, oniony roll. Excellent start. For our entrees, we got the Chocolate Chip & Banana Pancakes and The Sunday Platter (house-cured salmon gravlax, whitefish salad, fresh cream cheese, capers & Kossar's bialy). Both were delicious and really satisfying. The pancakes were very generous on the chocolate, which was melted and spread nicely throughout the middle of the pancakes. The lox and the whitefish went really good together on the bialy. We actually asked for some more of the delicious complimentary onion rolls to use to make some sandwiches with the additional lox we had, and they were nice enough to give us a couple more.We also got the much talked about potato pancakes - they were OK, but nothing special (I mean, they're fried potatoes, so clearly they taste very good, but whatever).If I decide I want to brave the hipsters again and come back for dinner, where I am not forced to pay for alcohol, I might add a star if the dinner menu has food as good as I had at brunch.",4,4,2,Mike C.,"Forest Hills, NY",5000,1694,69834

3.0,7/16/2012,"I'm not sure whether to be annoyed at this place for messing up so much, or to commend it for (sort of) making up for it each time. Probably just annoyed since there are just as good brunch places that don't mess up, period.One time, the waitress spilled a drink on my friend's shirt. But then she spent the next 15 minutes or so knelt behind him, dabbing it with baking soda trying to get the stain out, and then I believe she said they'd cover the dry cleaning bill. Spills happen and the response from the service was good, so this was nice.Then just yesterday, we waited for our brunch food for more than an hour, which is when I flagged down the waitress and asked her what was going on. She said it should be no problem, that our food would be out soon and she'd check with the chef. Well, she came back and apologetically told us that they actually completely lost our order, in addition to another table's. We literally saw two tables arrive, order, get their meals and drinks, and leave, before we even got ours. I wonder if she would have even noticed if I hadn't said anything.She tried to make up for it by saying they'd comp all our drinks, but unless you're ordering Bloody Morty's all breakfast, that's a pretty useless offer during brunch hour, considering we were dining on the fixed-price brunch menu which already included all the drinks that we were ordering at the time (mimosas and bloody marys). I think two hours of our time wasted, with completely no information or updates initiated by the waitstaff, is worth more than four saved dollars.I like the atmosphere and great natural lighting of this restaurant, their unlimited brunch drink deal, and their 3-hour open-bar + dinner prix fixe menu, but thinking about it, the food is only mediocre. I've had a handful of the brunch meals, and the steak for dinner, and I wasn't really satisfied with any of them. Also, the mimosas are also often served lukewarm. Gross. And cash-only for brunch, another minus. It's not a dealbreaker, but consider the competition that does accept cards, always.

4.0,6/29/2012,"I was contemplating on giving this space a 3 star but after much pondering I decided on a 4. For the girls monthly dinner I arrived an hour early. What do I do? I engage in happy hour. I ordered the mango lava lamp and their tilapia & mango ceviche. Now many of you yelpers out there know that I despise cilantro. Of all herbs I cannot stand cilantro. So one would assume I would not enjoy their ceviche. BUT BOY OH BOY let me tell you this ceviche was delicious! It had ample amounts of tilapia, mango, tomato, onion, avocado and cilantro. I didn't even mind the cilantro. The chips it came along had such a spice to it - it balanced out the herb. I have never had bits of mango in ceviche but it complemented the tilapia. The tilapia was cut in squares, juicy and tasted so fresh. LOVED IT! The mango lava lamp was a tad strong which is not bad for a $5 cocktail. However I do think their other drinks are a lot better. I tried the King George, Pickled Saint and the strawberry mojito. The king george was weird tasting - champagne and red bull. It is an odd mix. My favorites were definitely the pickled saint and the strawberry mojito. I would lean more towards the pickled saint because it was so refreshing and light. Definitely a drink for a workday happy hour. Finally my party arrives so we ordered some appetizers and entrees. For appetizers we ordered the crab cake and the lobster mash potatoes. Both were delicious. The crab cake app is a singular crab cake with hearts of palm salad underneath. Pricey but tasty. I lovedddd the lobster mash potatoes. They put ample amount of lobster meat in the mash potatoes. (I just wished they put it in a nicer bowl for presentation.)Entrees - we had the baseball steak, lobster mac & cheese and the pork chop. Out of all of the plates the pork chop presentation looked the best. The baseball steak was cooked and seasoned like any normal steak so nothing too remarkable. I'm not normally a fan of pork chop because most restaurants tend to overcook it and becomes really dry. This was the case. The spinach and creamed corn did little to help - I think the corn had too much cream (sort of lost the corn flavor). The lobster mac & cheese was very cheesy with cold haricot, edamame and citrus salad. The lobster mac & cheese was the sloppiest looking plate. I didn't think the dish was bad. I liked the mac & cheese and I think the cold salad tasted well against the dish. (After much thinking I would definitely prefer the appetizers over the entrees.)We also tried the the oysters: east and west coast. My first time - not bad...not bad. Not really sure what to think of it. For dessert - we ordered the molten chocolate cake, the banana foster and the coconut and mango sorbet. My favorite was definitely the banana foster. All of the desserts were presented beautifully, the banana foster and sorbet were in martini glasses. Both of the sorbets tasted exactly like mango and coconut but in sorbet. Delicious! The banana foster had a bit of rum in it (from what I tasted). I don't remember what the molten chocolate cake tasted (so obviously not memorable). Not big on the restrooms (you know me and restrooms). The restaurant decor is simple and clean which is nice. You could never tell it is a restaurant from the outside. It looks like some factory. We went on a Monday night so the place was pretty empty. I wonder what it looks like on a weekend. I would definitely come back to check it out during the weekend. Also the reviews I had read previously was for brunch so I might want to check it out. I never knew there were $1 oysters around the city so not to sure if this is the spot - but definitely keep an open mind and try it out! ~happy eatings!",1,0,1,Rosa C.,"New York, NY",397,236,27

2.0,6/13/2012,"The gist? My friends and I went for brunch and I thought the food was rather forgettable, the service inconsistent and the Bloody Mary one of the worst I've ever had. Now, the experience wasn't ALL bad (good company, after all), but I just can't see the appeal unless the bottomless (read: NOT bottomless) brunch beverages alter your perception.The good:-Bright and sunny atmosphere. Our balcony view of the craziness below was a prime spot too.-The large portions of food. If you're going for quantity vs. quality, this will do the trick. My Mexican breakfast scramble wasn't bad either (I'd give it a 6 out of 10), though I did drench it in hot sauce.-Our second server. Very attentive and nice.The not-so-good:-The reservation policy. Like one of the other reviewers said, the policy of charging you a percentage if your whole party doesn't show up causes unnecessary stress. It's a bummer when places make you put a credit card down for a reservation... but it's even weirder here because apparently it's cash-only when the bill comes. And even with a reservation, we still had to wait to sit down in a room full of empty tables. -Our first server. Our waiter had a really hard time explaining the no alcohol thing clearly. (Note that on Sundays, NYC cannot serve alcohol until noon, so you're effed when you unknowingly make a reservation at 11 a.m.) We were obviously confused and feeling short-changed since there was no alternative price listed for non-alcoholic brunch, but he didn't offer us any answers. Instead of simply letting us know what was going on, he seemed to just pass our table off to another server (who was much better, as noted above). She explained how drinks work pre-noon and it was sorted out, but it wasn't a great first impression.-The (not) bottomless beverages. I'm gonna be real with you: since the food is kind of mediocre, the biggest appeal of this brunch is getting tipsy during it (all brunches, really). To be fair, the menu doesn't say bottomless. It says brunch includes three drinks, but from the other reviews and accounts of friends, it sounded unofficially bottomless. However, our drinks didn't start until 30 minutes into our meal so we were asked to vacate our table for another reservation after two drinks (one of mine being that terrible Bloody Mary). Our server set us up with tickets to each have one more mimosa at the bar, but still... not bottomless. Sad face.",5,2,0,Annie D.,"Minneapolis, MN",2864,914,2633

The $1 raw oyster was tempting but I didnt think it was that fresh or tasted as good as it should've. We also ordered the mussels in tomato chorizo sauce and cheeseburger empanadas. I didn't like the sauce that came with the empanadas, its not what i was use to and it didnt compliment it at all. The mussels were a little tasteless. I felt that like it was a soup and with every bite must come with the soupy sauce for it to have any flavor.

1.0,6/6/2012,"Dude gross. Don't do it. Came here for brunch and one word summarizes that whole experience: MISTAKE. At about $35 a person after tax/tip, this meal was not worth it and food was barely edible.  You'd actually be happier taking $35 and putting it through a shredder and going to McDonalds for an Egg McMuffin. There was a hair in one of our friend's dishes.  Looking back, this hair might have been the most appetizing ingredient from the meal.  The poached egg on my Eggs Benedict was overcooked so the yolk was solid. Come on, Cooking 101.  It was unlimited ""fresh"" squeezed orange juice that Sunday, but I never even asked for a refill because something tasted off.  Setting is nice though, with a spacious light-filled loft interior, but ambiance will not override the disaster in front of you.  At least the bar has a TV so you can follow a sports game instead of trying to stomach your breakfast.  No wonder they offer all-you-can-drink mimosas here for drunk brunch; you literally have to be blacked out wasted, to the point where your taste buds are numb from the alcohol, to eat this food.  So appalled!",4,3,1,Shelley W.,"Palo Alto, CA",121,39,27
4.0,6/4/2012,"Update- came back for another birthday brunch and things were much better. I got the Vegan Matzo Brei which was delicious and creamy even though it obviously had no cream. Other diners raved about the French Toast and the non-vegan Matzo Brei and of course, the bialys are too die for. They don't serve them hot but maybe they aren't supposed to be?? My only complaint is that the waitress didn't give me any cutlery and it took me about 10 walk-bys to get her attention. In her defense, serving a restaurant full of AYCD'ers is no easy task. She probably thought I was flagging her down for an extra mimosa :). Waa!! I was so sad to eat here yesterday and have a really bad experience. I've been to Essex many times in the past (though not for about 6 months) and that is the only reason I gave it 2 stars instead of 1...hoping it was an off day.First, arrived to find the place full of SCREAMING drunks. They probably wouldn't have bothered me but we had a reservation and had to wait 30 minutes so the group of guys in lacrosse jerseys by the bar got really old really fast.Next, the brunch price is now $27.95. That's fine- still not a bad deal- but their website still says $22.95. They updated their website to include a Memorial Day 2012 special (that was last week!!) so you think they'd at least update the brunch price while they were at it...I can't imagine the price jumped $5 in one week. The host of this brunch sent an email telling us how much brunch was ""all-inclusive"" but was completely wrong because of the website and half the group had to go run to the ATM...it's also Cash Only. Next, they wouldn't allow us to split our bill (even though the group was 20ppl and 5 of us wanted to split off so we could leave early). Next, my potato pancake dish was just gross. The ""spinach-shiitake-black bean hash"" looked like someone mixed frozen spinach with canned black beans and let them sit together til they were the same temperature. The ""apples & honey cream sauce"" was congealed and cold. Couldn't eat it at all.My fiancee got a Lobster Benedict which we sent back because the Lobster, egg and english muffin were all cold - not room temperature but actually cool to the touch- and chewy. They get credit for filling drinks quickly, but the food was just not what it used to be.

5.0,5/31/2012,"Went with my best friend on a wednesday night to take advantage of their lobster night deal. It was exactly what we needed after a long day at work. Between the two of us we got:- A glass of champagne, a glass of wine, a margharita ( all1/2 off cuz of happy hour)- 2 lobster dinners ($18 each yum!)- a dozen oysters ($1 each all night long) - fried calamari- peanut butter 'sigh' pie - cappucinosOMG it was amazing!!! The drinks we good quality, the lobsters were big, juicy, and fresh and not rubbery.  Served with perfectly cooked corn on the cob and roasted potatoes. The oysters were so so fresh! Although they could have done a better job shucking, there were a few that were a bit beat up. But i'm guessing with the amount of oysters they shell out in one night, those pour shuckers are in the back shucking away fast and furious style! They serve 2 sauces with the oyster, a red  wine vinegar sauce and a spicy cocktail sauce (divine!). We even started to dip our bread in the cocktail sauce after all the oysters were gone. I was afraid the peanut butter 'sigh' pie would be too heavy, too sweet, or too thick. It was AMAZING! Apparently while talking to our waiter we learned they get it special ordered from Sugar Sweet Sunshine bakery down the street. It was almost like a mouse, light and creamy and peanut buttery. WIth a light graham cracker + brown sugar crust. It went perfect with my cappucino (perfectly made by the way). The only things that were 'ok' was the bread  they bring to the table: bread should be warm and toasted, and the be warned, that is Mayo not butter in that little sauce cup with the bread! Also the fried calamari was just so-so, standard calamari, nothing special. Service was great! We had a reservation but my friend showed up an hr late, and she still upheld our reservation and seated us the second i said ""ok we're here and we'll sit now"".

It's half off speciality drinks, which are pretty good and $1 oysters, depending if you like oysters or not, but I love them. I will say they trick you a bit, $1 oysters are East Coast oysters and the West Coast oysters are $2.

To start, we all shared 3 different potato pancakes: one topped with goat cheese, another with salmon and caviar and the last I think with applesauce and caramelized onions--the goat cheese one was my favorite (they may have been on the specials list, since I don't see them listed on the regular dinner menu). My favorite drink (ordered on a whim) was hands down the Mango Lava Lamp. The table's list of entrees is as follows: the grilled free-range half chicken with porcini mashed potatoes, the manchego mac n' cheese (one with lobster, one without), the cajun spiced catfish over shrimp, potato and scallion hash and the wasabi-crusted atlantic salmon over sauteed veggies and himalayan red rice. I myself ordered angus ""baseball"" steak with lobster mashed potatoes, asparagus and mushroom-peppercorn sauce--it was pretty satisfying and tasty. Aside from my own dish (since I pretty much sampled everyone else's too), my favorites were the porcini mashed potatoes (which came with the free-range chicken) and the manchego mac n' cheese with lobster. We saved room for dessert and decided on the bananas foster and the molten chocolate cake to share. They were ok, but nothing I was overly impressed with. I wasn't much of a fan of the odd interior design/layout of the restaurant (it's bi-level, with lots of seating on the ground floor and it looked like maybe a few tables on the upper levels on either side; at the time we went, one group took over one side and was having what looked like a birthday dinner; maybe I wouldn't have minded the layout that much if we had sat upstairs), but otherwise I had a decent time at Essex.

We ate fairly early (9ish), we had a reservation and the place wasn't crowded on a Thursday night but I've seen more than a few places take that same scenario and make a mess of it, so I was pleased.The warehouse height of the ceilings and the comfortable seating make you feel like you could be somewhere in Brooklyn, minus the hipsters. A portion of their drink menu comes by the pitcher and I recommend taking advantage of that (since you were going to do that anyway). The salmon was decent and I enjoyed the fries (but this isn't really news. I almost always enjoy fries).

We were seated right away, at a high table in the bar area which did not seem an issue at first until a large party came in and drowned out any hope of hearing conversation. It is a nice atmosphere with a good going-out vibe. Service was good and quick, so a plus for that. We ordered two of the specialty cocktails, which were tasty but were overpriced for what they were. The food was decently good but nothing I would come back for. We got the short rib slider appetizer, which you would think might come with more than just 2 sliders. Thankfully I looked inside mine before I bit into it because it was the fattiest piece of meat I have ever been served, more fat than meat to it. Almost inedible but I tried to salvage a bit so I could eat it. The calamari was quite good with the best part being the dipping sauce. We got the mussels with the tomato chorizo sauce, which were the highlight of the meal. Very tasty. They no longer serve sweet potato fries, so we added the regular fries which were very oily and not impressive. Lastly, we split the napolean cake entree with spinach, asparagus, truffle oil. This was a tasty dish and the vegetables were very nice, but the potato cakes were quite oily.I came here for brunch 2 or 3 years ago and really enjoyed it, but now I understand why they are known for their brunch and not dinner. Overall, a decent meal but with so many other places to try in NYC, nothing made me want to return which is why I cannot give more than 3 stars. Go here for brunch or drinks with a good bar scene, skip the dinner.",1,0,0,Lindsay P.,"Manhattan, NY",9,10,0

What the hell is the point of a reservation if you have to wait an hour?? It was embarrassing cause I set it up. The only reason its getting 2 stars is because once we did get sat, our server was AMAZING and so was the food. We got refill after refill of mimosas and bloody marys.

3.0,4/11/2012,"Wow did we have an interesting experience at Essex.First of all, I gave it three stars b/c the food was good (not amazing) and those three drinks with brunch for around $23 are phenomenal.Now to the nitty gritty. My group of seven arrived around 10:45 on Easter Sunday. We had an 11AM reservation. When we arrived the staff was still setting up and not really seating anyone. While we were waiting I observed a woman who I took to be the manager yelling at a few frightened-looking waitresses and running around with a sour look on her face.We were seated and our waitress informed us that she could not serve us alcohol until noon since it was Sunday - an old NYC law apparently. Ok, no big deal. We'll take our time we said, the restaurant is empty anyway. Our waitress just smiled and said ok but if it got busy she'd just give us drink tickets for the bar. Fair enough.I'm not going to lie, we stalled a little but it did take some legit time for our group of seven to settle on orders. While we chose our food we ordered coffees. While we were reading the menu the angry woman I saw when I first arrived came over to our table and proceeded to half-lecture, half-yell at us saying that we needed to order and that the customers would soon be busting the doors down to get in so our table would be needed. We took a look around the 2/3 empty restaurant and sat stunned. I felt like a school kid being yelled at by a teacher, not a 20-something patron trying to enjoy her brunch.Needless to say when she finally walked away we were pissed. Our waitress seemed apologetic but what could she say with her boss lurking nearby. RIght when we were about to place our order the waitress had to run and get something. In that 2 minute gap the angry manager came back and started in again. She said over and over how many people were going to be coming in and that we had to order NOW (note the restaurant is still mostly empty). One of the guys in my party finally  had enough and told the woman firmly that we were just about to order and that our waitress had walked away. She said something snide and walked away.The rest of the meal was pleasant. The angry woman tried to curry our favor with speedy refills and a couple smiles. We were not amused. I have only been treated that poorly at a restaurant once before, nearly 2 years ago and I haven't been back since.It's such a let down when you have a good meal and great company and the customer service is just awful.",3,0,0,Bethany P.,"New York, NY",143,359,14

We did not have to ask for more, they noticed that our glasses were a bit shy and they brought over another one. On to the food...no complaints, just praises.

That's the reason why it's 2 stars and not 1.That being said, the brunch food was not good at all :( I tried the potato pancakes as well as the lobster eggs benedict with potatoes and both were very disappointing. My poached egg on my benedict was entirely cooked, and the lobster was barely covering the english muffin. The potatoes were hard and overcooked. The potato pancake was decent but is something I can make (hash browns) at home. Because it was easter brunch the bill was $27 for an entree and a drink, and with tax/tip it came out to around $35 a person.I like the idea of boozy brunch here - I think it would be fun but until they redo their food, I don't think I'll be wanting to come back here.",0,0,0,Joyce H.,"New York, NY",468,553,272

I asked our waitress, who was extremely nice and helpful, for some recommendations, and decided to try the duck, and decided to order the $1 oysters because, well, they're $1. The duck was EW. SO much fat it was painful to swallow (that's what she said?) and on top of that the dish was around $20. All the other dishes looked fairly unimpressive...I had a taste of the pork chops which were meh at best, the mac and cheese looked like easy mac with lots of melted cheese on top, and the burger looked like any other johnny rockets burger.The whole place was extremely loud and rowdy, and on two occasions someone screamed really loudly. So basically, this place gets a 2 and not a 1 because the waitress was soo nice considering the rowdy crowd, and the oysters weren't half bad.

I thought the sangria could have used some more wine, and the food, a little less soy sauce. I had the wasabi-crusted salmon with sauteed veggies over Himalayan red rice. You know those wasabi pea snacks you get in the Asian grocery stores? Yep, that was the crusting. Besides the fact that the salmon was cooked well with a nice crispy skin, the soy sauce was overpowering on the sauteed veggies and red rice. Overall, there was nothing outstanding about Essex, other than the 45-minute wait for our food, and the waiter nearly smacking me in the face with the plate as he was handing me my dish. But the next time I come across this place when I am in the area, I will just walk past it knowing that there's nothing really special inside, just like the way it looks on the outside.",0,0,0,Colleen S.,"Manhattan, NY",33,58,55

4.0,2/16/2012,"Ohio girl alert! One of my favorite things about NYC is the brunches. You seriously cannot get brunch with 3 bloody marys for $22 in Columbus. Won't happen. My friends that brought me to Essex warned me that we could be in for a long wait, but we arrived around 12:30 on a Saturday and waited only about 15 minutes. (Now, I'm told this is the exception.) Overall, the bloody mary's were just okay. So, if I were rating based only on those this would be a 3 star review. However, the food was fantastic and the service was prompt and very friendly. It was packed beyond belief as we were leaving and that was probably around 2 or so. OMG. Just remembered...one drawback was the teeny tiny bathroom.

4.0,2/15/2012,"I love and hate Essex. And here is why:My friends and I made reservations for 4 at 2:00 pm for brunch. When we got there, we had to fight the crowd of waiting customers at the bar to get to the hostess. Since it was a Sunday, the subways were messed up and one of us were late. The hostess wouldn't seat us until all of us were here. And even after the last of us arrived, we still had to wait another half hour for a table. Lesson to learn: if everyone arrives early, you may be seated on time.On the bright side, the $23 prix fixe brunch comes with three drinks. We all ordered mimosas while waiting at the bar, and our three drinks turned into ""we will fill your glass when it's starting to look empty.""Essex is always bustling with people during brunch time. However, we were seated upstairs and it was pretty comfortable. We all ended up getting the lox, eggs, and potato pancakes because it was absolutely the best thing on the menu. The potato pancakes were to die for, and one of my friends actually ordered more! However, if you aren't a fan of eggs, smelly fish, or fried food, there's plenty of other breakfast foods like pancakes and waffles.Overall, if you have some time to enjoy a long brunch, this is definitely your spot.",0,0,0,Jacqueline M.,"Brooklyn, NY",46,34,0

3.0,2/8/2012,"Came here for brunch last Saturday for a friend's birthday.  Made a reservation, which was probably one of the smartest things I've done.  We were sold on the $22.95 brunch that included 3 popular brunch libations. I indulged in their lobster benedict and was not disappointed.  I had heard great things about this brunch spot, but was weary that it was just a fancy brunch spot that might serve small portions on giant white plates (you all know what I'm talking about)On the contrary, they serve generous portions of food - 2 lobster benedicts, home fries and mixed greens and to top it off, my mimosa glass was never empty.The only qualm I have was being kicked out of our table after we were finished eating.  As each person is entitled to 3 drinks, one of our diners was still working on their second and asked for the third.  The waitress then presented him with a ticket to get their drink at the bar because 'they needed the table.'  I get it, every restaurant needs to make money and turn tables over.... But it's not like we were one of those tables that linger and hold up precious dining space in order to chat about inane subject matters; the busboy had literally cleared our plates before we were asked to get up.The place was packed, but I think beginning-to-end service should still be the crux of any dining establishment.  Yes, you feed your patrons, but in the end it's your patrons who feed you.",0,0,0,Monica H.,"Manhattan, NY",30,93,0
5.0,2/7/2012,"This is THE boozy brunch spot, and this is coming from someone with a lot of experience. Huge menu selection. Unlimited mimosas, blood mary's and/or screwdrivers. Awesome ambiance. And friendly service. A couple things: for the love of god, try the pancakes. I am an egg person, period. I always get eggs. But, when my friend and I geniously decided to split and omelet and the chocolate banana pancakes, I literally gobbled down my share of the pancakies within minutes. I wore those chocolate chips on my face with pride. Second, try all three of the drinks. I'm also not a bloody mary person, but this drink was a perfect blend of spicy and alcoholic. Yum. My BF deemed his screwdriver not strong enough and asked for his next refill to have more of a kick: I kid you not, they brought him a glass of vodka with a splash of orange juice. They don't skimp on the details here. Third, don't even THINK about coming here for brunch without a reservation. That being said, we were all 45 minutes late (I know, I know.... we're those people. I still blame the F train) and the restaurant was still able to accommodate us. Again, very friendly people here. Finally, and this might be the most important, you CANNOT drink alcohol until noon. NOON. Meaning, if you have an 11am reservation, that's right, you won't be served the boozy portion until noon. So, make a reservation for 11:45am to beat the 12/12:30 rush.

4.0,2/5/2012,"The awesomeness of this place as a brunch spot is obviously well documented  (and the praise is appropriate, and well deserved), but for the purpose of this review I wanted to focus on my dinner from a few hours earlier this night, and specifically the great service that was provided. Seriously, my group and I were admittedly lacking of certain courtesies tonight, and they put up with everything without any attitude at all. For starters, I changed the time and size of our reservation with a only a few hours notice - no problem. When I arrived 15 minutes late - only to find out I was the first person in our party to arrive - I asked how long they could hold our table, fully expecting a curt reply, maybe to the extent of ""not much longer"". But all I got from the host was a warm smile and a, ""No problem at all, just let me know when your friends are here"". And when my friends finally got there another 15 minutes later, short one person, they sat us immediately (even got an awesome table, not pushed away in a back corner or anything). Already this is rather impressive, especially considering it was a Saturday night. The place wasn't completely packed yet, but was getting pretty close, so I don't think it was particularly easy for them to manage this. Then throughout the dinner service they were friendly (and prompt), coming back to take our orders multiple times, because we took forever to getting to decisions, and then because not everyone was ready as we finally started ordering. They accommodated odd change requests to the food, such as getting the fried calamari without breading (I know, don't ask) with not much more than a quizzical look. They were on point with water refills. And when we were done, the place was very packed, but there was no pressure/ suggestive glances our way, as we sat there and chatted for quite a while longer. Also, when they did mess up, and brought me the wrong drink order for my second one, they took it off our bill without my having to ask (the green zinger is delicious btw).Now I realise much of this is how things should be done, but let's face the fact that it's not necessarily what we've come to expect from extremely popular and busy restaurants in very popular neighbourhoods in this city. So they deserve a lot of credit for maintaining such hospitality, and such a friendly demeanour. Not to mention the food is fantastic, and very well priced (great oysters, salads, and orzo with mushrooms). This has always been a great fun place to swing by, and for me they exemplified that tonight. Sure won't be long before I go back again.",3,0,1,Zayed K.,"LONG ISLAND CITY, NY",56,76,245

We only had to wait about 10 minutes to be seated for our 3:30 pm reservation and were taken to a table in the downstairs area. Yes, this place is loud but that's to be expected with boozy brunch.

On the menu it's clearly stated that your brunch only includes 3 drinks - your choice of bloody marys, mimosas or screwdrivers. This isn't terrible unless you make the mistake of ordering mimosas. Our server would refill our glasses before we were done with them. When we asked him about this he assured us that he always did this and would refill our glasses four or five times to make up for the difference.

1.0,12/25/2011,"This review is based strictly on my experience, not including the food, because we walked out before we began.We had a brunch reservation. It was my first time at the restaurant. When we walked in, the host podium was located in the middle of the restaurant, not right by the entrance. This seems like terrible design, given the hosts are supposed to greet and guide incoming guests. I had no idea who to talk to or where to go. Nor did anyone approach us, so we stood around by the door for 5-10 minutes until we had to approach what looked like a host podium, where who looked like a manager and a hostess hovered. Even when we approached them, they made zero eye contact...(hospitality industry...?) If you want to be that sort of fancy L.E.S. establishment you're going for, maybe the hosts should have a basic dress code... that's not an American Apparel ad?They sat the three of us on a table for two, facing another table (which was very close and awkward). Anyway, the lady who approached us at the table (server? manager? don't know) was kind and understanding when we explained we were leaving.",2,1,3,Anna S.,"Brooklyn, NY",19,32,0

2.0,12/22/2011,"I have attended Essex Restaurant once before for brunch, and was happy with my experience. Also, for some reason, ""word on the street"" is that this place is amazing for brunch. A bunch of friends and I decided to have a girl's brunch to catch up and figured Essex would be a great choice because of their great selection of food and 3 brunch drinks with every order.I must say, this will be the last time I ever go to Essex for brunch. I ordered the Lobster benedict and was not all that impressed. It came to the table with barely any lobster on it. I am used to ordering lobster benedict with a lot of lobster! There were small shredded pieces loosely sprinkled onto the english muffin and covered in the egg to camouflage the missing lobster. I expected to received many more chunks of lobster.Overall, the flavor of the dish was good. The potatoes were also very succulent. But, I  still just can't get over the lack of lobster that I paid $2 extra for. To make my experience even worse, the waitress only gave each of us two out of three rounds of drinks and tried to rush us out of our table. Since brunch included 3 drinks per person, I inquired on my third round, and was told that she needed us to pay our bill, and that she would give us drink tickets to get our round at the bar. This was absolutely ridiculous, because when we got to the bar, it was so over crowded, without a seat in sight, or even a spot to get in and order a drink! The waitress could have easily brought us our round while we were sorting our bill, but decided to be unaccommodating. My friends and I just decided to give up our last round and leave this joint because the scene at the bar just seems too stressful. So long Essex, you were good while you lasted!

My overall opinion...it's fine and dandy as far as boozy brunches go, but beyond that it's nothing special. I came here mainly because it was one of the only places I was able to make a reservation at within a week's (or month's) notice at any of the trendy Lower East Side brunch spots. Most don't even accept reservations. Since I'm not too keen on the whole wait two hours to eat thing, I decided to come here. My friend and I waited about five minutes once arriving to be seated. We were taken upstairs and seated right near the mimosa mini-bar. (Score!) The drinks got me buzzed pretty fast. Our waitress came over quickly to take our order and the busboys set us up fast despite the packed house. I scanned the menu for my favorite brunch options. No omelettes? Or pancakes?! Weep :( I went with what I thought sounded great but ended up just being....eh. It was eggs with avocado, pico de gallo, peppers, beans. I thought it would be a burrito without a tortilla. The meal seemed to be churned through a blender though. There were barely any avocados on the dish.  It didn't taste bad, but definitely not what I was craving. At the end of the meal, the waitress came over and bribed us to move to the bar with drink tickets. They really want to turn tables over here. This isn't a place to sit and hang out all day, unless you plan on buying food and drinks continuously. I did get pretty drunk off my four mimosas though! Of course immediately following brunch I came home, took a nap, and popped some Advil to relieve my hangover from the cheap champagne.

Finally 3 hours later we get a table and then i realize that people don't go there for the food! Its all regarding the drink tickets.

2.0,11/11/2011,"With all the trendy places littered about the Lower East Side, I am a bit confused as to what all the excitement over this place is. I wound up here with friends on a Saturday night pretty much because it was the one place that had a table for six (without reservations) at around 7:30 pm... Everywhere else was telling us we would be out of luck until at least midnight, so we were ecstatic when Essex said they could take us.That atmosphere is very industrial/night club and definitely seems geared more toward letting the fashionistas be seen than serving up good food. The music playing was quite loud, and while it wasn't deafening, it definitely meant we had to nearly yell at one another to have a conversation... and it only got worse, the later it got. Maybe the staff at Essex are going for a trendy, romantic place, but it really just felt like this wasn't a place to eat dinner.The one thing that struck me when I was looking over the menu is that everything seemed to be very reasonably priced; I expected prices to be through the roof, but the cocktails, apps, and entrées were much cheaper than I expected. The cocktails themselves were actually very delicious (the blood orange cosmo was not a mistake), but I was disappointed that our waitress was fairly in the dark when it came to asking about non-cocktail bar selections. My husband wanted to order a whiskey or bourbon, and our waitress didn't really know what was on offer, until she grabbed a menu, and even then, couldn't really answer any questions (like the vintages) about the liquor on that.As for the food, this is where I was really underwhelmed. We ordered a few apps, and they were teeny tiny, and while fried mac & cheese kabobs may sound delicious, these were seriously bland and insipid. My mussels & fries that I ordered had good flavor (though the fries were only mediocre - not nearly crispy enough, nor worth the extra $3!), but the mussels themselves were very tiny and shriveled, and not as succulent as I'm used to. My husband ordered the pork chop and found it very tough; he would have sent it back had our server ever appeared again... Needless to say, she wasn't present very often, so the opportunity never arose, so thank goodness his sides were tasty and well-prepared!Overall, I just wasn't impressed with Essex as a dining spot. I could conceive of coming back for drinks, maybe, but even though brunch is supposedly amazing, nothing I ate was sufficiently tasty that I would have any interest in trying the food again. This seems like a place that value style over substance and as a restaurant, I have to say I don't get the appeal.

Nice big chunks of lobster with most bites was pretty heavenly.  While not a michelin restaurant by any means. It's a good local LES spot. It's good. Nuff said.Wednesday special. 1 1/2 lb lobster.

4.0,10/30/2011,"I went to Essex for brunch recently with some friends and we really weren't expecting much from the food.  I mean, $22.95 for a brunch that includes three drinks?  How good could the food be?  I'm pleased to report that we were very pleasantly surprised by how awesome the food ended up being.  I went with the potato pancakes - crispy on the outside, soft on the inside, and all around delicious (especially the apple & honey cream sauce).  The side of shiitake-black bean hash was an odd pairing with the potato pancakes, but it was still quite tasty.  I sampled my fellow diners' dishes - chocolate-banana pancakes, Mexican scramble, and manchego mac & cheese - and all were delicious.  We all enjoyed the wonderful mimosas, which were refilled from a pitcher.  Essex lost us a bit in the end, though, when we were asked to give up our table for drink tickets.  That part was fine - what was not fine was the rude bartenders who initially screwed up our drink order and, when they finally gave us the screwdrivers we ordered, seemed to have forgotten to include the vodka in the drinks.  All in all, though, Essex was a solid brunch spot and I would definitely recommend giving it a try.Tip: remember that brunch is cash only!",1,0,0,Annette M.,"New York, NY",228,263,0

Is. Not. Okay.  When we asked the waitress why this had happened, she informed us that they were out of home fries and that we ""should have come earlier."" (Maybe if we hadn't waited twice as long as we'd been told, we WOULD have been there earlier.)  When we pressed her for other side options, she reluctantly brought us a plate of fruit, but told us that was all that she could ""spare.""The visit was rounded out when the three of us decided to split a giant pancake, after admiring the one that our table neighbors had ordered, and we were, once again, given the wrong order.  It was pretty much the cherry on top of a series of unfortunate events, although the taste of the pancake (when they finally got it right) did a little to erase the bad taste that was left in our mouths.",1,0,0,Alaina W.,"Brooklyn, NY",18,42,4

4.0,9/8/2011,"Brunch here is something you need to plan ahead. Reservations are your best bet which can be made through Yelp (aka OpenTable) as well. If you're planning on coming on a Sunday, plan at least a week ahead as the 12:00 pm slot and thereafter get filled fairly quick. Slots from 11:00 am - 12:00 pm don't tend to fill up as quick since alcohol cannot be served before noon on Sundays (as per New York state's blue law). It's especially anti-climatic if you come here for their brunch special before noon and have to wait for your alcoholic beverages. We had reservations for 11:30 am, but could not be seated until our whole party was there. Conveniently, the rest of our party got there only a few minutes before noon, so it didn't take long for our drinks to be served after we were seated.The decor is minimal with large white brick walls and a few plants for aesthetics. There is a bar area that serves double-duty as the waiting area. It can get very crowded during brunch hours, almost to the point where you feel like you're in a club and you can't really walk around. There are three areas for seating, a section beside the bar, and two areas located on the second floor (one in the front and one in the back).The brunch special is $22.95 for any entree, with several items having an additional surcharge, and also includes 3 bloody marys, screwdrivers, or mimosas. But don't worry about the 3 drink limit as the waitress will frequently come by to refill your drinks with disregard of how many drinks you actually had. The Bloody Mary and Screwdrivers are served in shot glasses with a lot of ice making it hard to drink without the straw but the alcohol content was decent. Just make sure to drink it fast so it doesn't get watered down. Meanwhile, the mimosas are served in tall champagne-like glasses making consumption a whole lot easier. The Bloody Mary was probably my favorite since I really enjoyed the spice kick factor. Also included in the brunch special is coffee or tea which is promptly served upon being seated. That being said, table service is great as the waitress will check up on your frequently, partly because they want to make sure you are happy and to get you to leave as quick as possible (read on to find out why).I ordered The Aristocrat, potato pancake topped with house-cured salmon gravlax, salmon caviar & poached eggs. Two perfectly poached eggs, with the egg white nice and soft, and yolk creamy without one bit of it being overcooked or solidified. The eggs were complimented with fresh salmon caviar. Biting into each egg was an explosion of salty and juicy goodness. Yum! The salmon gravlax, which is cured salmon, was fresh. The potato pancake was perfectly crisp on the outside and very delicious. Overall, the Aristocrat is a solid dish that makes that steep $22.95 price tag feel a lot more reasonable.I also tried the 3 eggs any style with fresh fruit and breakfast sausage served with mixed greens & home fries. The scrambled eggs had a nice fluffiness,  and the chunks of home fries were cooked to softness and subtle spiciness. It's a solid dish that won't disappoint, but it's fairly easy to get this as dozens, if not hundreds, of other breakfast establishments. At $22.95, I would recommend ordering a more delicately prepared and intricate dish.By 1pm, the front bar was packed. As soon as we all finished our meals, our waitress dropped off the check. After 10-15 minutes she noticed we still didn't pay for the bill and came by again and gave each of us a ticket for a free drink at the bar. It was her polite way of saying, pay and leave so that we can serve the next guest. We felt a bit rushed, but I understand the business semantics as they don't want people just sitting away the day taking away business.Essex is a solid spot for brunch, with solid dishes that won't disappoint. Although drinks are limited to 3 varieties, the lenient restrictions on 3 drinks a person are definitely worth noting. It's a great place to meet up with friends though don't expect a cozy and quiet meal here. If you haven't been here, I recommend checking it out.

The mimosa was too strong, the screwdriver was diluted, and the regular orange juice was not even cold. The food was decent, but was not worth the $23 even if it included drinks.

I'd describe this place as hipster chic and classy. Brunch was only 22.95 and had really great options for breakfast (very fancy options), I had the french toast with fresh fruit and banana cream. It was YUMMY. You get 3 choices of drinks, bloody mary, screw driver, or mimosas. The drink weren't unlimited and you only get 3. The drinks were nice and strong.This place is well worth going to, I spent 30 dollars for breakfast (this includes tip and tax) and had three drinks included with my breakfastBeautiful art work and a very open space.

2.0,8/10/2011,"Yup. Came back and still shitty. Holla at Amal if you read this! :) Why would I come back you say? Well, I went to the Yelp Elite event across the street last night with my bf. He went to the Groupon Buy it Now section and got a free groupon for $30 worth for this place. It was convenient because it was right across the street. Yes, it was Wed night and the place was not filled to capacity, and we sat upstairs which is probably the most ignored section (like 15 tables per waitress- silly). BUT does that honestly justify an 1 hour wait for food? he whole damn dinner was almost 3 hours and then I had to trek all the way uptown to the UES only to get a crap night of sleep and wake up grumpy now writing this review at work. That being said. Allegedly, a health inspector came in 10 min into our meal (he sat next to us like the big bad wolf... scaring patrons and staff alike. Our waitress was so fearful and whispered into our ear...""it's his reason the food is taking so long..the chef had to stop cooking...""...and when I asked about a meal update after waiting 35 min, the hostess wouldn't even mutter a word). Jesus people! I know a health check is important but I find it very hard to believe that a the world had to stop because of the health check guy... I mean that was really bad for their business. I quickly noticed that it wasn't just us but EVERY table was waiting in agony. Yes, we got lots of free crap bread (room temp white loaf with butter ) and eventually fried calamari.. which was prob. the best thing I had- with some like of lime/chipotle dipping sauce. The calamari was tender and golden fried- good while hot- but it's hard to fuck up that. When the food finally came it was just ok. I got the warm goat cheese salad- on arugula, with walnuts and beets. I was expecting a crouton goat cheese type thing (you know breaded and fried for 3 seconds..very Barefoot Contessa..yum) but it was not crispy and I think baked. The beet was attached to the cheese and did not have any flavor. The dressing would have appreciated on the side- it was a raspberry vinaigrette.I also got the famed potato pancake with sweet onions and applesauce. Onions were too sweet and buttery- but that's not their fault, just not my thing. The apple sauce was good- but it was probably Mott's. The cake itself was too fried- it washed away the flavor of the potato. The greens were greens. My bf got the grilled half chicken with porcini mashed. I got the mashed p's (thanks the strong albeit bitter flavor of the porcini) was the best thing I tried- that and the fried calamari. He thought the chicken was good but it was too fatty for me. It was a good portion though. Good thing we only paid $10 for dinner. If we had to cough up a full price for a 3 hour dinner and mediocre food, I would have calling up the manager this morning. Safe to say I ain't going back- they can't do brunch, and they cant' do dinner.The waitress was sweet though.

1.0,7/27/2011,"Anna is the WORST hostess I've ever encountered in any nyc establishment. It's amazing she still has a job. I went out to Sunday brunch at Essex for the first time last week with a group of friends and we will not be returning. She was extremely rude to us when we were simply putting our name down to wait. She miscalculated the wait time -sure, it's Sunday and busy so that was understandable but she didn't have to be so nasty about it when we asked for an update 20 minutes past the time she originally told us. During our meal (cash only and a locked in price regardless of what tiny dish you choose mind you) our waitress accidentally dumped 2 full mimosas on me. I was soaked and our sweet waitress felt terrible as it truly was an accident. Although I didn't love getting soaked, everything up until this point was ok- not great but at least ok. The food came- again, just ok. The really appalling part came when we were finishing up our meal. We had just generously tipped our waitress and were finishing up our drinks when Anna came over and told us, not asked, for us to finish up our drinks at the bar because there was a 4-person reservation waiting for our table. Umm, excuse me? First off, there were many tables around us that had been there far longer than we had been (the cash hadn't been out of our hand for over a minute), there weren't any seats at the bar or space to finish up our drinks because that is where everyone waiting for tables is (and we'd already spent enough time getting shoved by her in that crowd when we were waiting for our table earlier), and lastly, you'd think she would have been at least a little bit nice to a table that got mimosas dumped on them. We were seated right next to the hostess station and although she spent most of her time dancing around, she definitely saw that. All in all, terrible hostessing. The waitress was sweet. The food was decent but unless you get good and drunk off the 3 drinks included in your price- it's really not worth  the money.

And they do not skimp on the champagne!So on to the rest of the experience...one of my best friends and I decided to go here on a whim one Saturday afternoon and actually reserved a table on Opentable 1 hr before we were going to show up. It was probably the best decision we could have ever made, because as we passed lines of disgruntled brunch-folk crowd waiting around for a table, ours was right there for us (Use Opentable for brunch when you can people!). We had a table at the top of the restaurant, which actually overlooks Essex (kinda cool, despite the fact it's not really the prettiest view). She ordered the Eggs Benedict and I ordered the Egg white omelet, which while taking a longggg time to be served  the portions were really quite decent and included a side salad and hash browns, and both of us were really happy with the meal. On the side we ordered one of the potato pancakes, because being the Jews that we are, we had to test it out.

I thought about City Crab or FISH... but I decided that I wanted to try something new.  I found a thread on CHOWHOUND about ESSEX's $1 ALL-Day-THURSDAY oyster happy hour.  I figured that there would be no way I'd make it in time for Ten Bells' HH so I decided ESSEX it is!I ordered 20 Blue Point Oysters which came with two sauces: a mignonette type sauce with chiles or jalapeno because there was a nice kick to it & another topping that resembled a finely diced salsa fresca - both were wonderful to pile on each oyster.  For an appetizer it was a toss up between the calamari with avocado/jalapeno dipping sauce, the crab cakes on hearts of palm, or the tilapia & mango ceviche.Being that I was feening for ceviche all morning, that was the natural choice.  But the choice fish wasn't too appealing to me, only because in my cultural, Tilapia was always considered a poor man's fish.  In the Philippines, Tilapia is one of the cheapest fish that you can find plus its farmed.  To this day, my parents think its crazy that Tilapia is on mainstream menus... although it is meaty and flavorful and easy on the pocket.  I asked the waitress which of the three she recommended - and without hesitation, she said CEVICHE! and so, Ceviche it was!The ceviche was pretty good.  I liked that they used a partialyl ripe/green mango. I was worried it would be a super sweet ripe mango that would over power the entire dish... the green mango added bite and a refreshing flavor.I also did not make it to happy hour on time, but my kind waitress gave me my first bottle of beer at 1/2 price anyway... Service was great, there was no room at the bar but the waitress gave me a table with no fuss or pressure to order anything from the menu.  The food came quickly and every four minutes someone was refilling my water cup =0)The couple in front of me ordered the Swordfish over a seafood bouillabaisse...

2.0,6/16/2011,"I came here for dinner a little more than a month ago for a friend's birthday. From the beginning, there were problems.Through some planning mixup, my friend's boyfriend reserved 17 seats for us for dinner in the bar area instead of the restaurant area. We didn't mind this so much... until our hostess informed us that there weren't actually 17 seats and ""usually some people stand."" After much struggling on both sides, we were finally allowed to push enough tables and chairs together for 14 people while the other 3 sat at a higher cocktail table with stools near us. Then, to make matters worse, the same hostess informs us that our party of 17 doesn't ""get a server,"" and we have to order from the bar. 17 people having dinner and drinks have to order from the bar? Really?I had a quick chat with the manager.When I returned to the table, a friend asks me if I ordered something. I half-jokingly replied that I ""ordered us a waitress."" The *oh-so-lovely* hostess is walking past us at that point, and I guess somehow interprets this conversation as being about her(?), and snottily interrupts to say, ""I'm not a waitress, I'm a hostess"" with a mocking smile. Don't worry, I set her straight, too. The good news is that our server for the rest of the night was wonderful! Very helpful and attentive. Some other positives:- Jalapeño margaritas - if you like jalapeño/have a decent spice tolerance, I highly recommend it. Unlike any other drink you'll order, and actually quite good - unless you hate that kind of spice, in which case you should avoid because it's strong and will probably make you sick.- Tasty scallops app with watermelon, croutons and some kind of vinegar - loved the flavor and texture combinations- Tasty duck entree Unfortunately the food wasn't actually good enough on the whole to bring this up to a 3-star. The mussels in particular were disappointing. The supposed ""white wine broth"" tasted more like chicken broth. We had also ordered a round of peach margaritas and, while strong, they did not taste anything like peach.

2.0,6/4/2011,"Chose Essex for its seemingly enticing, varied, and well-priced brunch menu, which included 3 cocktails (your choice of bloody mary, mimosa, or screwdriver) and any entree for $23.  Met up with a girlfriend for a 3pm reservation on Sunday of Memorial Day weekend.  We didn't anticipate too much of a crowd, being that it was both a holiday weekend in the city and on the later side for brunch.  I got there around 2:40 (unheard of for me - I'm typically 10-15 minutes late for EVERYthing, shamefully), at which time the entire restaurant was absolutely packed.  I mean bursting at the seams with people, and LOUD as all hell.  This did not make for the best first impression, especially for someone desperately seeking a cool, relaxing reprieve from the sweltering city heat.  In fairness, the crowd did slim down significantly by the time my friend arrived 20 minutes later, and we waited under 10 minutes to be seated.  I do have to make note of the clientele, because it was just SO homogenous that it was actually off-putting.  The crowd was dominated by young women who looked to have been imported straight from the Hamptons' club scene, with a smattering of their similarly dressed male counterparts.  I don't recall seeing anyone I would have pegged for over 30 anywhere in the room, and my friend and I may have been the only people there whose outfits could not have translated into nightlife attire.  Now, mind you, we are both native Long Islanders, but, as my friend so eloquently put it, ""I stayed in the City this weekend to AVOID the Long Island vibe, not to be smacked in the face with it!""... or something like that.   So, just a word of caution to anyone looking for a ""low-key"" type of atmosphere - this ain't it.On to the food!  It was good..enough.  And that's all it was, hence my rating.  We shared the eggs benedict with spinach and the mixed greens salad with steak.  The high-note for us both was that the steak was well-seasoned.  We wished for more pumpkin seeds in the salad, and actually, more greens as well.  We found the salad portion shockingly small, and were very glad that the egg dish came with some greens on the side, or we likely would have requested more.  We were given bread upon being seated, and that too, was just fine.  I had both mimosas and a screwdriver, which basically tasted the same.  Shout out to poor quality liquor!  But that's to be expected in an all-inclusive brunch, so I'm really not complaining... Really!  My friend had some bloody marys, which I hate and she loves, and she said they were totally satisfying.  Overall, we agreed that the brunch was a good value, and might return for that fact alone, despite the food leaving something to be desired.  ""Not every meal needs to be a gourmet, life-changing experience!"" we reasoned.  So if you're looking for a place to have some light and standard brunch fare and get a little tipsy, and you can put ambiance aside for the sake of your wallet, Essex should suit you just fine!P.S.

I had the catfish which was tender and flavorful in all the right ways. The only smudge on the evening was that the mojitos seemed to be universally disliked.

3.0,5/27/2011,"I came here of their  oyster happy hour, which is a pretty sweet deal: $1 oysters ALL NIGHT Sunday through Thursday; drinks 1/2 off 6-9pm[1].For happy hour, they have one West Coast variety and one East Coast one. The West Coast oysters were Hama Hama (from the Hama Hama river on the Olympic Peninsula of Washington State): they come in a beautiful sand-green shell, are small in size, with firm meat, briny flavor, and light finish.The East Coast oysters were Blue Point (from Great South Bay in Long Island): larger in size, very mild taste, bland and boring[2].My jalapeno margarita ($10) was not bad at all: I like spicy drinks, and this one definitely had a balanced kick to it that went well with the oysters.While sipping my margarita and enjoying the oysters, I couldn't help notice their extensive brunch menu. I don't believe in brunch, but I feel that I could potentially revisit my beliefs at this place.The best seats in the house? By the bar, of course!-------------------------------------------------[1] The $18 Maine lobster plus potatoes and corn on the cob dinner special that they serve on Wednesday night sounds sweet as well.[2] Blue Points can be a bit of a hit or miss, unfortunately.

Everything was OK but nothing blew me away. I would have given this place 3 stars except I tried ordering a virgin cocktail (allergic to alcohol) and the bartender said he couldn't do it.

4.0,5/25/2011,"Essex is located in the lower east side, in a big loft, adorned with white-painted-tennis balls on the wall.  The vibe is cool, casual, young, and chill. The lighting is on the darker side. The music is inviting, with a mix of top 40s and 90s.We came here for a 8pm reservation.  Upon arrival, the hostess was non-strategically placed in the middle of the restaurant, past the bar, down the skinny walkway, leading to a traffic jam while waiting 30 minutes for the table.  Aside from that fact, the restaurant was very open and spacious.  Good for groups up to 8.Now the best thing about Essex is their happy hour.  Half price drinks daily until 9pm.  Since it wasn't until 8:30p when we got sat, we quickly ordered 3 rounds of mojitos and downed them like water, partly to meet meet the happy hour deadline, but partly because the mojitos were very good.I ordered the cajun catfish with shrimp, over scallions and hash ($18).  The catfish was moist and tender, with just the right seasoning.  The portions were just right.  My friends ordered the chicken and they enjoyed their dishes as well.In summary, the vibe at Essex was very cool.

This place looks like Willy Wonka threw up! Can you actually get the bedspins while still out on the street? Whoa, candy cigarettes and pop rocks! Maybe not a good idea right now.But back to Essex. Had a 3:00 reservation and entered into a crazy cramped and loud bar area. Checked in with the hostess and was told it would be a few minutes. Had to wait amongst the LES scenesters and play body bumpers for about 15 minutes or so alongside the crowded bar. I felt bad for those sitting at the tables along it as all of our asses were constantly pushing into their faces and backs. Nothing like a face full of ass with your omelet!Hostess came by and rescued us from this mass of humanity and led us to the holy grail of seating - a table right in front of the bar on the upstairs level! I was so happy I wanted to jump for joy. The waitress that served our area was absolutely kick ass! She was funny, cool, friendly, and Australian. We joked around with her the whole time we were there. Along the way super strong bloody mary's and mimosa's kept magically appearing on our table. I must admit, they are very liberal about the three drinks with brunch here as I lost count after the 6th or 7th glass. Yes, this was power drinking, and I watched the heavy alcohol pours they were putting in each glass. Wonderful! I am going to request a table by her again no doubt! I think I blacked out at one point during the meal.Oh, we did actually eat. We ordered the Mexican Matzo Brei - scrambled eggs with tortilla crisps, monterey jack, avocado, black beans & pico de gallo. Perfect meal with about 10 bloody mary's! We also ordered the three eggs poached with fresh fruit & chicken apple sausage and potatoes. Both plates were decently tasty and filling. A few onion rolls were also placed on our table when we sat down. More then enough food to help soak up all the alcohol we consumed.But there's more! When we received our bill we were given tickets for two more drinks at the bar. Brunch is cash only and at $20 it is a bargain considering all the drinks we had. At this point crowd had dwindled down a bit and we grabbed two seats at the bar and resumed drinking. After a few more our waitress saw us as she walked by and we waved hello. Before we knew it the bartender told us another round was on the house gratis from our waitress! I felt like we were in a dream of an alternate NYC where fairies and alcoholic sugar plums danced happily all around us.I do have to say we had a great afternoon brunch here. You do get a lot for $20. It is very crowded and loud, so reservations are a must. What is great is that brunch is served 11-8 PM so getting there after 3 or 4 also seems like a thinner crowd situation and a more relaxing time to arrive. I know not everyone will have the same experience we had, but be friendly and outgoing with the staff and you never know - drinks might magically appear! Man, am I still heavily buzzed! The wheels on the bus go round and round, round and round. Mmmm.....Ho Ho's. Yum.",18,35,16,Phil H.,"New York, NY",5000,3324,13021
2.0,4/1/2011,"Brunch at Essex was one of the worst brunch experiences I've had in NYC.My grievances:1. Even with reservations at 2pm, we still waited 20 minutes in the most claustraphobic, awful waiting area in the front bar area.  There was almost no way to move through - control your crowds!2. Speaking of those crowds... we were nicely seated in the middle of that crowd at a table that obvious should not be there when that packed.  Due to how crowded it was, one of my friends couldn't even lean back in his chair and I was MISTAKEN FOR FURNITURE.  A guy just started leaning on my shoulder and when I turned to glare at him, he said, ""Oh man, so sorry!  I thought you were like, something to lean on!"" - NO.3. This magical land of never-ending mimosas never happened.  To be fair, the menu clearly states the brunch includes 3 mimosas, but for how crappy the location of our table was, you'd think they would have been a bit more generous.  You could also tell they were in a hurry to flip tables as quickly as possible.The food itself was pretty good, but nothing is worth that clusterf**k of a waiting area.  I'm surprised it's not a fire hazard as it blocks the entire entrance.  Don't come here for brunch unless you enjoy being treated like cattle.",0,3,0,Phillip L.,"Brooklyn, NY",47,269,50

AMAZING.. they were so strong I had to stop after 2 screw drivers!The scene is vibrant and loud which is fun if you are with a group of friends.The only bad thing is it is very tight so you get bumped into a lot from people trying to get to their table and there is no place to put your bag because a table of 4 literally only fits 4 people and their food.",0,0,1,Diana H.,"Lebanon, NH",209,381,14

Portions were a bit on the small side though, but I'm not complaining since we had such great deals with the oysters and drinks.This is a divey type place with a chill ambiance. By dive I mean that the bathrooms aren't the cleanest - okay they're darn right disgusting. And this isn't the place for a romantic date since the ambiant noise can reach 100+ decibal range.

My favorite menu items include the burger, the manchego mac & cheese, the Mexican Matzo Brei, and the chocolate chip pancakes.

They have a 3 limit max on drinks but when we went most of the servers were walking around with pitchers of mimosas and would just pour whenever they saw we were running low.

3.0,3/22/2011,"I've been to this place for happy hour, dinner and a night out on the town. The ambiance of the place is very warm, comforting and ideal for a date if need be. It can also get loud especially during happy hours which makes it a fun place to be. Typical of LES places, it is long, deep and narrow. Excellent happy hours on Thursdays. One of the better deals in the city with specialized cocktails. The food here during dinner is quite good. Thursday specials for dinner are their $1 oysters, now if only I could determine what type of oysters they are.... but for $1 that's an absolute bargain. As the night progresses, there will be a DJ spinning some records which I guess turns this place into a lounge kind of place. In short, this establishment is a swiss-army knife.

5.0,3/20/2011,"Essex is one of my FAVORITE RESTAURANTS!! Their food is always consistently good and their slews of drinks are absolutely amazing. To start off, their drinks are always delicious and full of flavors. I strongly recommend their fresh watermelon martini. Not only is it mouth watering, but it's also refreshing!!! Their espresso martini is also very good and it's perfect especially after a meal. As far as their food, their crab cake over hearts of palm salad ($11) is a definite must!!! Unlike most places that use claw or rib meat, they use JUMBO LUMP instead. Not only is the meat more high end, but it taste much sweeter and more mouthful.The décor of the restaurant is equally impressive. Although the outside of the building might look deceiving, the inside is quite the contrary. It's chic, modern, down to earth, yet fun, trendy and spacious. I especially like the mezzanine because it offers different perspectives of the restaurant depending on where you're seated.  Let's just say that this restaurant is seriously the perfect synergy for anyone who is looking for good food, but who is also on a tight budget. All in all, I highly recommend this restaurant to anyone, because it's really that GOOD!!! _________________________________-Brunch: $20 includes 3 drinks (bloody marys, screwdrivers or mimosas)-Lobster Night, includes potatoes and corn on the cob: $18-Oysters All Night Happy Hours-Half Price Drinks (6-9pm/Sun-Thur)",1,1,1,Nga C.,"Brooklyn, NY",524,480,2034
1.0,3/20/2011,"Four stars for foodOne star for initial service... Which overrides the food in this case...I recently hosted my sister's bridal shower at the Essex knowing that she really loves this restaurant. I had booked the party over a month in advance and was under the impression that this place had experience with big groups... After all, their website advertises ""balcony brunches"" for large parties... Apparently I was wrong!! When our 27 guests arrived on time for our reservation we were not even greeted by a hostess and were left standing in the doorway for about 30 minutes because (as one rude hostess put it) the manager made them seat people on the wait list despite the fact that a large party was on their way. Did I mention that many of our guests were from out of town and that we were paying CASH?? When we tried to get answers as to why our tables were not available the hostess remarked ""if you've ever been here before then you should know that we always have to wait."" And when we requested to speak with a manager she said the he ""probably won't want to talk to us."" What kind if manager refuses to speak with a customer... Especially when it concerns close to 30 meals paid in cash????  In all fairness, there was one hostess that was much more pleasant and seemed to actually understand the concept of customer service... This second hostess graciously offered us some sort of apology and eventually got us to our tables and pointed the manager out to me.... To be frank, the manager is a huge PRICK with dirty teeth and a bad attitude. First of all, when I approached him I asked if he was the guy in charge and he LIED saying he was not the manager of the restaurant (even though the hostess said he was). And he immediately blamed the situation on me. In order to accommodate our party (that I had booked way in advance and confirmed days before), he ended up moving other customers mid-meal... Saying things like ""you don't want to sit next to this party anyway... You know how a bunch of women can be"". I was left to apologize to those tables and thank them for their understanding!!! He also called my sister a nasty name and gave us such attitude the entire time!!! He insisted that our party was incomplete which is why we were forced to wait so long for a table(ok, so only 25 of the 27 were actually there on time... Big deal! We agreed to pay for the 27 meals regardless!). BUT once our party finally got settled, our waitress and  bus staff were so so nice and very helpful. And the food and drinks are quite good. The manager did end up giving us a discount (at first he tried to offer us a free round of drinks... Even though their brunch comes with drinks anyway... What a f-ing douche). Bottom line here: Good food but be warned that you may still end up leaving with a bad taste in your mouth. And the manager should probably be fired or at least take a course in customer service.",3,0,0,Joanna C.,"Boston, MA",5,64,0

Regardless, it's still a good deal.The drinks were okay but my entree was phenomenal. Based on the reviews here, I ordered the potato pancakes and I was definitely not disappointed.

There are plenty of brunch places in and around the Lower East Side that are not as busy, have good but-mostly-lacking-in vegan-options menu and allow one to indulge in a two hour all-you can-drink brunch cocktail fest.  Let's face it, brunch is not always about the food, but which place has the best return on investment in terms of booze.  I was not the one making plans, so I suspended my boycott and I'm so glad I did.  Had I held steadfast I would have not learned of the few vegan dishes on the menu in addition to the liberally flowing cocktails.  There would be no substitutions or a meal made up of side dishes.  Oh no, not here.  In addition to the full on vegan meals on the menu, tempeh bacon was a side dish.  You had me at hello.I ordered the Vegan Mexican Matzo Brei sans soy cheese, of which I am absolutely not a fan.  It doesn't melt and tastes like plastic.  I can only imagine what happens when introduced into your digestive system.  Not sexy.  Essentially, the Vegan Mexican Matzo Brei was like if chilequiles and the traditional dish had a baby.  Tofu was used in place of scrambled eggs, softened tortilla chips in place of bite size pieces of matzo and it was dressed with tomatoes, onions and cilantro.  On the side were sauteed spinach with shittake mushrooms and a generous pile of avocado.  The only suggestion I would make is if there was a dollop of tofu or cashew sour creamI left full, happy and a little tipsy.   The true signs of a good brunch.  It was a lovely surprise and I'm actually be willing to continue to suspend the boycott, though I won't just go and wait hours on end, congregating on the sidewalk in front in hopes of getting a table.  There must be reservations.Brunch is $20, is cash only and reservations recommended knifestylesofthefitandfa…",0,0,0,Shana R.,"New York, NY",123,23,8

HELLO!?!  As much as I wanted to speak out against the actions of the host, I decided to keep my composure and just enjoy the evening with some good food.  Unfortunately, that didn't happen here.  Oh, by the way, we weren't even seated right after the two guests that came after us... Anyways, the appetizers were a tease to the nightmare that was to come.  We ordered steamed mussels with chorizo in tomato-basil to start off the meal and it was the only good thing that satiated our hunger. Typically when my boyfriend and I had come here in the past, we'd order the steak or pork loin.   This evening though, we decided to switch it up.   My boyfriend ordered the manchego macaroni & cheese with edamame, haricot vert and citrus salad.  I ordered the half-pound Angus burger topped with mushrooms.  When our food came, I was pretty disgusted by the presentation of my boyfriend's dish.   The mac & cheese looked like it was pressed down on the plate and was shaped into a pancake.  And the edamame and salad was composed of the following: boiled edamame and string beans--it looked like baby food.  Really Essex, how could you serve this?  My burger on the other hand, looked pretty good, but small--looked as if I could finish it up in four bites.  Whatever, it's all about quality to me... Too bad it was nothing more than bad though.  The burger tasted like burnt charcoal.  My boyfriend (who practically eats anything) didn't believe me, and took a bite.  He thought it was disgusting (and if he thinks it's bad, it's DARN BAD).  Oh, and as for the burger bun, it was mushy and moist.  The bottom bun was actually pastey.  I was inclined to send the dish back, but being that the burger was small to begin with, it looked as if half of it was eaten so I didn't bother.  We sat for another couple of minutes before asking for the check to move on to another restaurant.  Essex, good bye, and good riddance!!!",1,0,0,Jessica M.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,1,0

A party of 2, we had the semi-circle booth table to ourselves the whole time we were there. We took our time ordering, starting off with their $1 East Coast oyster specials (yay!) and making our way to calamari and scallop appetizers.  The calamari was the better of the two appetizers.  Slightly spicy, super crisp and flavorful and ample in portion, it's so worth the $11.  But, by far, the highlight of the HH is their unbelievable half off drinks specials.  Their watermelon martini is probably the best of its kind-- it's super fresh, refreshing and perfectly sweet.  And if you're like me and don't like sweet drinks, try their green tea martini or their Blood Orange Martini.  Definitely coming back here again for quality time with friends over drinks.",0,0,0,Mona L.,"Los Angeles, CA",189,314,45

The seafood pasta special I had last night was fantastic too, but I remember the waitress telling me that it was with linguine and I somehow got angelhair.

It does get fairly crowded on weekends, but the ambiance is great and the service is excellent.  The entrees are good for what you get, and they refill your drink before you know it.  Because they are booked back to back, they often have to ask you to vacate your table.  But, they give you a drink ticket at the bar, so rather than feeling angry that you are basically being kicked out, you are more than happy to vacate the table (might also be the 3 cocktails that you have consumed). If you are looking for some top notch brunch place, this probably isn't the place for you, but if you are looking for a fun place to go for a boozy brunch with friends, this is the place for you.  I will definitely be going back.",2,0,0,Yoon U.,"New York, NY",14,74,1

We also got steamed mussels in red sauce, which were so good.  The red sauce has sausages and onions in it, which was also a nice little pleasant surprise. My friend told me they used to have curried mussels, but now they only offer them red or white.Essex has a big open loft feel to it.  The ceilings are really high and there is even an upper level. It wasn't crowded at all in terms of personal space, but there was definitely a substantial crowd, especially for Tuesday evening.

1.0,3/2/2011,"A group of friends and I went to Essex on a recent Saturday night for dinner (6 of us). Overall the experience was subpar and I would not eat here again. The food was bland and really uninspired. 3 of us had the chipotle pork loin, 2 of us the potato layered thing and 1 of us the salmon. The pork was really nothing special. It was not marinated and the chipotle sauce was clearly added after cooking. The sauce, the only real flavor, tasted like a cheap store bought variety. It came on a bed of corn/mushroom salad which was decent. Also, the waitress asked us how we would like the pork cooked? Like we were ordering steak? Isn't that tantamount to asking ""how would you like your chicken cooked?"" The potato layered thing was soaked in oil. The description on the menu promised truffle essence, I assure you there was not a hint of that delicious truffle oil smell or taste. What a pity because the bland taste of that dish really could have used some nice truffle oil flavor. I didn't try the salmon, but my friend who had it said it was ok, not bad, not good. The service itself was terrible. The waitress was constantly reaching in front of us (pouring us water while we were cutting our food). When pouring the wine she dripped water from the wine bucket on my pork.  The real nightmare came when we ordered desert. It took 30 minutes for the waitress to come out and explain that they ran out of one of the pies. We changed it to a cake, 20 minutes later the deserts came out (excuse was: the chocolate molten cake takes a while to cook. BTW the center was warm at best and we ordered that 50 mins ago!). We were offered a sorbet dish as an apology, which was nice.  That dish itself was ok, strawberry sorbet was kind of gummy and freezer burnt, but the passion fruit was good. It took another 30 mins to get the check after repeated attempts to flag down the waitress. Atmosphere is weird. Music is loud (like being in a club). Bathroom is in front of resto so you have to push your way through the heavily overcrowded bar area to get there. I would not recommend this place. I will not be going back.

3.0,3/1/2011,"After checking out the Essex Street Market, we had walked past this restaurant and decided to give it a try after seeing the menu posted outside.  Had a reservation for 7 on a Saturday, and arrived around 6:50, upon which the restaurant was oddly somewhat empty, with the exception of about 5 ppl at the bar.  We were informed that our table would be ready at 7 and asked to wait by the bar.  Jumping at this opportunity to run across the street to pick up some cupcakes from sugar sweet sunshine, one person in the group stayed at the bar, while the other three of us left for 10 minutes.  Much to our surprise, when we came back, the bar area was packed, yet the tables were empty.  Suddenly it was a mad rush for everyone to be seated at 7.  Logistics-wise, probably not the best way to seat people, but if the food proved to be good, then that's all that mattered to me.What we ordered:- Fried Calamari - what can I say?  i love fried calamari.  This was not the greatest calamari - it seemed soggy and not well fried- Seared Scallops - this was one of the tastier dishes - scallops were well cooked for the most part- Pork belly sliders - the meat itself was odd, some parts were super dry and stringy, while other parts were melt in your mouth.  seemed as though it was thrown together with leftover scraps of pork belly.  smothered in a very heavy bbq type sauce which was a little overwhelming.- Tuna sushi spring roll - exactly what the name implied - nothing special- Cheeseburger empanadas - not like a traditional empanada.  very heavy on the outside crust, minimal meat filling.  disappointing- Essex Famous Potato Pancake with onions and apple sauce - again, nothing special.  greasy and heavy.  I'm hoping it was just an off-day with the deep frier- Cuban sandwich - this was just ok.  again, exactly what you'd expect- Cajun spiced catfish - this was actually the best dish - the tastiest.  the cajun spices were a little overwhelming, but a welcome change from the items listed abov, and the shrimp and potato hash delicious as well.Ended the meal with a coconut custard pie and molten chocolate cake, which again, were nothing special.  Overall, the food was just average.  Nothing I really disliked, but nothing that really stood out.  This is not a place I would go out of my way to revisit.  With so many other options in the lower east side, I don't think I will find myself returning in the near future.",0,0,0,Pam W.,"Manhattan, NY",1,16,0

I should stop using the excuse of ""seeing friends"" to do brunch in NYC, especially when I don't even like brunch foods.Went here for a very late (2:45) brunch reservation. Unfortunately I got there 10 min late and our 3rd party member got there 30 min late. We decided to wait it out for our reservation.But while we were waiting I realized this is not a place I would ever go to on my own. I showed up in my hoodie and jeans, because come on, it's a friggin' Sunday brunch and my lazy day. I was really the only one. People here were overly trendy, even for NYC. If not for the sun beaming through the windows, I'd say we were at some hip lounge/club filled with finance dbags and girls doused in makeup and fake tans. I kind of lost my appetite a little just rubbing elbows with everyone. And rub elbows we did. There was absolutely no place to move while we waited and the hostesses, and waiters were constantly shoving their way through us.And finally the coup de grace. After waiting another 30 min (it is now 345), we were told to wait by our stairs by the hostess, so we could be seated at the upper balcony. After 5 min, we see a party of 3 go up. She had given our table to someone else!!! When we asked the hostess about it she just mumbled and walked away.

This place seems to be much less of a sh*t show than what I've heard the brunch is like. They have a nice wine list. Unfortunately I picked the bottle and i ordered something far sweeter than my friends and I typically  like. Oops! But that's my fault not the restaurant's.  We had the calamari as an app. (I personally think that's a boring choice when there are so many more interesting options like cheeseburger empanadas!!) I didn't choose the app but as far as calamari goes it was done really well. Right proportion of crispy breading to chewy inside. It was served with this amazing avocado habanero sauce. Only problem was they serve the sauce in much too small of a bowl. We needed more half way through. On to dinner...  The potato cake napoleon has so much potential. Fried potato, asparagus, mushrooms, spinach. Such great ingredients. But unfortunately it's super bland. According to the menu it comes with truffle oil, but I definitely didn't taste any and that's a hard flavor to miss. Shane(my buddy) got the lamb. My other friends, Joe and Tom both got the salmon. Shane seemed to like his dish a lot, though for me it was a little fatty. The salmon was great and it came with this wasabi sauce that gave it more than a little kick!!

2.0,1/9/2011,"Despite lowered expectations after prior experience, Essex's brunch manages to continue its ability to underwhelm. Their salmon gravlax remains salty and lacking freshness. Home fries came soggy and bland. And if poached eggs weren't the easiest thing to prepare, they could have quite easily fudge that up too. Even if one were to be safe with the Angus burger and fries, the only compliment made was for the gruyere cheese. But then again, let us ignore the food for a moment. Albeit easy to do, the coffee tasted terrible - like a cross between Tim Horton's and Folgers Crystals. (No offense to those who enjoy either one of them.)For a twenty dollar brunch, I don't believe it is unrealistic to expect good food, good service, and good ambiance.

4.0,12/28/2010,"I wasn't exactly joking around when I told friends during lunch a few weeks ago that Yelp was starting to take over my social life, and since I don't have many friends to begin with, it really meant that for better or worse, Yelp was starting to become my social life. I suppose, in an attempt to seem less like a socially inept loser who sits in front of his computer in his Transformers boxers all day, what I really meant here is that I have been spending more and more time with other Yelpers. And so when I started wondering what I would do with myself on Christmas Day when most of my friends are sure to be having family time, it seemed completely natural that I would stumble upon information that would lead me to have lunch with a group of Yelpers at Essex on Christmas Day.To the disappointment of children and Christmas enthusiasts all over NYC, we did not have a white Christmas this year. But this was good luck on my part since I woke up late and had to get from Flushing to the Lower East Side where Essex is located. The subway wasn't going to do the job. It's Chinatown shuttle to the rescue! The weather was good and the roads were sparse of other vehicles; the driver took advantage of this good fortune and the shuttle arrived in Chinatown in 20 minutes flat. I didn't even have time for a proper nap!By the time I walked over and reached Essex, all the other Yelpers were already there. And wow it was packed! I was extremely glad that Janeen B. had the wisdom to make a reservation. I guess many other New Yorkers preferred to spend Christmas afternoon with friends brunching at a swanky spot in the LES over a few bloody maries or sangrias. I squeezed into the seat next to my Cantonese bro Will C. and my first order of business? Screwdriver, please. My drink came within minutes and it was very tasty indeed.  I perused the menu while I chatted up with the other Yelpers and as soon as I spotted that one of the ingredients in the ""CEO"" was chorizo, I knew I had to order it. As I am writing this review now and looking at Essex's menu online, it reads that the CEO comes with chorizo, scrambled eggs, and onions served with corn tortillas.  But I distinctly remember there being no onions, and instead there was fried potato pieces.  Maybe the potatoes were only for the Christmas menu?  At any rate, the wait for our food was not long, and we had good conversations and good bloody maries, screwdrivers, and mimosas to accompany us.  The chorizos turned out to be diced and scrambled into the scrambled eggs, and the potatoes were of a reddish colour.  I was not sure what seasoning they used for the potatoes that gave them the colour, but I did like it a lot.  Fried potatoes are often very dry, but what was served at Essex was not.  Scrambling the chorizo into the scrambled eggs was a nice touch - delicious, but living in Queens, I've definitely had better chorizo.Conversating with other Yelpers while we continued our merry making, aka drinking and eating, I was very impressed with how well our waitress handled the busy and full tables for which she was responsible.

However I ended up here for dinner, perhaps I will make the journey down here for a super rich brunch one day.  This place is relatively small, dimly lit and a little loud but .. I suppose its fine with the space provided.  You enter through this totally incased brick building the windows are set high so dont expect a view of the outside world from inside this restaurant.  The bar is located directly on the right hand side. Then tables follow, I noted that there was upstairs seating but maybe they only utilize it when there is a bigger crowd. (also I was there fairly late on a Tuesday) THe menu is fairly straight forward, they give you a paper list of specials then a wine list and a normal menu which is basically half food and half drinks.  After scanning the menu for more than the normal time I ended up ordering the 'Roasted Duck Breast' It comes on a bed of bok choy and a little duck spring roll on the side. Quite a lovely presentation and tasty dish.  The sauce that it is served in was tasty as well. .A soy sweet sauce that the duck sits in.  WIthout the sauce I imagine that the dish would be quite bland and boring.  Perhaps if I ever venture back here again the server mentioned that the Spicy Chipotle Pork Loin and the Burger were the specials of the place.  Burgers I feel are so casual.. Who knows, maybe their burger is out of this world and I really missed out though!Anyways, the meal was great, and the place is really great too.

I made the mistake of getting the blueberry pancakes which were probably one of the worst pancakes I've ever had. The only redeeming thing about them was the fact that the blueberries in the pancakes were real. Seriously you can make better pancakes with packaged mix. It was dry with too much flour and basically I got a mouthful full of sticky bland dough. Sigh. But I won't judge an entire place on one dish, especially since everyone else seemed to like their Eggs Benedict or whatnot. The THREE drinks also helped. The only weird thing was that they had to charge $25 each on credit card when in fact it was only $20 per person, and since we didn't have cash on hand we paid $5 each for a group of 20 people just for the privilege of using our credit card.

3.0,9/4/2010,"Went here for the infamous brunch. Not impressed. Here's why:-It's like Club Brunch. The loud music was annoying. -They have fancy palm pilots to place orders, but they messed up one of our orders. I think a pad and paper works better.-The salmon in my dish definitely came from a can. That's not forgivable.On the plus side, the place has an energetic vibe, and the 3 drinks were pretty good.

4.0,8/30/2010,"I was pleasantly surprised at how good dinner was at a place that has been much better known for brunch (to me at least). I had a Groupon for $30 for Essex and went with my dad and my husband to try it out. Since the food was fairly reasonably priced, we decided to just go for it and get a pitcher of margaritas since we were getting $30 off. The mango margarita was killer...really heavy on the booze but the mango juice made it very drinkable and the sliced limes in the pitcher were a nice touch. It would not have been worth the $50 price without getting $30 off though. We got the cheese plate which was pretty good...standard selection but the honey and the apricot (I think) compote were really good. I got the potato pancakes all three ways and all were delightful. The best was the potato pancakes with a huge pile of smoked salmon and salmon caviar but the others (sauteed onions on one, goat cheese & arugula on the other) were really good as well. The potato pancakes were fried golden and crispy most of the way through with a nice and soft center...exactly the way I like them.The mussels in white wine sauce were one of the better iterations I've had recently...heavily spiced broth with all good decent sized mussels. There was not a bad mussel in the bowl.The bread and butter was actually one of the highlights of the meal particularly when used to sop up the broth that the mussels came in!I don't know if I would go back here just because there are so many restaurants I want to try in any given week but I did really enjoy dinner.",0,0,0,Tara L.,"Jackson Heights, Queens, NY",158,593,17

3.0,8/29/2010,"Two Stars for a bad brunch experience,  four stars for an excellent dinner.  Let's average that out to three stars.Bought a groupon ($15 for $30) here for their famed brunch. My friends and I wanted to try an NYC drunk brunch and Essex seemed like the place. Let me just say that Essex is NOT said place.Made reservations for 11:30 on a sunday. Place was packed even though you can't actually drink until noon. (I did not know this until I got there, but they were kind enough to serve us coffee and tea for free until we could start in on our three drinks.)$20 for all entrees and that includes drinks. This would be a good deal if the food had been up to par. I got steak and eggs which I believe was a couple dollars more. The steak was rubbery, and eggs were ok. Honestly there was nothing special about the food. Drinks were strong. That is what is important I can imagine when it comes to this. I had read that no one really counts how many you get, but I actually wound up with less than my three per person alottment due to the poor service. The waitress had attitude, and worst of all when I tried to use my groupon she informed that I couldn't.  This was in small print on the groupon itself, and completely my fault for not seeing that, but still, I was not enthused about A having to pay full price for brunch and B having to come back to a place I didn't really like in the first place. Well months later the groupon is about to expire and I drag my boyfriend down for dinner. Needless to say Essex during the week is a completely different experience. The restaurant wasn't crowded and I was easily able to get a reservation day off for a wednesday night. On wednesdays they have an $18 lobsters special which had I been in the mood I would have jumped on, but I had my eye on the $13 mac and cheese. All of their drinks are half off till 9pm, and we took advantage by trying a few cocktails. These were all fantastic, much better than the generic mimosas served on the weekends. And at $5 a pop, pretty reasonable too. Boyfriend got the burger, and was very satisfied with it, I watched him devour it in a matter of minutes. Mac and cheese was delicious as well.They also have $1 oysters all night which we tried, and they were great too, if a bit on the smaller side. Still at that price I am not complaining. Service was a complete 180 from the brunch experience. Our waitress was attentive, and friendly. Plus the atmosphere was quieter, and more relaxed than the hectic weekend crowds.  So the bottom line is this go to essex for dinner, and avoid their brunch.",1,0,0,David W.,"New York, NY",238,148,14

Heck, wheres the liquor?!?!Blackened Catfish:  Salty.  If it was the seasoning, they need to cut back on it or not add salt to their mixture because I felt more dehydrated than after running a mile.  The potatoes were borderline cooked/uncooked.Squid ink ravioli stuffed w/ a seafood mix:  Bland, tasteless, and the inside was so overcooked it felt like eating a hard cheese.Salmon:  Well done when asked for medium.Fried calamari:  Why did mine come w/ tomato sauce when it says it's suppose to be habanero avocado?  Another order came out fine.  Seems either the batter wasnt made properly or the fryer wasnt hot enough because the crust just flaked off and I had more fried batter on my plate than squid?Oysters:  Ran out of West coast oysters, fine.  But why are the other ones the size of quarters?  Looks like they sliced one in half and put 2 on some empty shells.The service was good in the beginning.  Our waitress was nice and attentive.  The food runners and bus boys looked like they could care less about any and everything.  Just dropping the oyster plates randomly at the table.  Cousin had to ask 2x for a refill of fries when it should be automatic cuz it comes WITH the mussels as a side.  I had good expectations of this place because the atmosphere is nice and great for a dinner date.  Unfortunately the wait time for the food on a fairly empty restaurant greatly dissappointed me as did the food.  Didnt think I'd spend 3 hrs at this place.",1,0,0,Vic L.,"Jackson Heights, NY",77,21,0

I don't know why but when someone says ""raw bar"", I think of a scattering of lemon wedges & shells, and just sitting at a bar with a bib while the guy chucking oysters right in front of you is filling your plate one half shell at a time. in other words, MESSY. that's definitely not the vibe here. it's typical of nyc restaurants - dim lighting, nice décor and tiny tables. FOOD:ok so don't judge me when I list down all we ordered for two people.40 OYSTERS - humid afternoon, horrendous day at work, $1 oysters. so perfect.SCALLOPS OVER CROUTONS, WATERMELON, PEACHES & BASIL - this was okay. sounds so amazing on the menu... but what a letdown. the scallops were way overcooked and didn't taste fresh. ehhhSTEAMED MUSSELS WITH WINE, GARLIC & HERBS - I LOVE steamed mussels. I love mussels in general! i was also kinda dissapointed by this - surprising since HOW IN THE HELL CAN A STEAMING BOWL OF MUSSELS BE SO DISAPPOINTING?! IT tasted okay at best, but the mussels were super tiny!!! I had a similarly-sized bowl at Cassis for brunch once and the mussels were much bigger. here, they were tiny and even though they were drenched in broth, they didn't taste juicy to me.FIRECRACKER BBQ SHORT RIBS - I thought this was the best dish - which was funny because we came here for the seafood and ended up liking the meat the best!SERVICE: I could tell that the server was slammed since we were seated on the 2nd floor by the entrance and there's a big party of at least 10 girls next to us. she was nice but could have been more attentive (I felt bad because she was all flustered as she tried to open our bottle of reisling)PRICE: the whole thing ended up being $200 with tip, for two people who can eat like a whole battalion. keep in mind we also got TWO BOTTLES OF REISLING. it's not bad but I wouldn't spend this much again at this place especially because of the tiny mussels and the dissapointing scallops. although, I WOULD come back here just for oysters. xoxo",0,1,0,Paola S.,"New York, NY",247,131,50

I had a Ciroc white grape martini and my companion had a pear mojito. The oysters were fresh and perfect, they have a homemade cocktail sauce which really makes them pop in your mouth (thats what she said). The diver scallops were the only low note in a meal that was otherwise spectacular. Considering we ordered almost all seafood, we were surprised at how they were able to really deliver on all the dishes. The crabcake was amazing, well seasoned, browned, and complemented perfectly by the underlying salad. The catfish, though a tad bland, was perfect for me because I'd rather my fish underseasoned than over, so you can actually taste it.  I wasn't a huge fan of my martini, and should have stuck to my old standby - a margarita. (Tequila is my main squeeze) Plus with vodka, if Diddy can't get it right, who can? (SO kidding).Essex is apparently also a great place to get your mack on - during our short meal in the lofted dining space, we were able to witness one gentleman lay the game on a young hussy sitting alone.

5.0,7/3/2010,"The Lower East Side is a neighborhood I have always viewed through the fuzzy, otherworld-y lenses of a sufficiently, and thus happily, drunk person. And this is during the daytime. The reason for the daytime good time has always been brunch at Essex, my favorite place to stuff my gullet on weekends. Whenever Essex comes up in a conversation with friends, it is always accompanied by a knowing nod and, ""Essex: great place to get trashed before 3 pm. Essex."" Like we're in Zoolander or something. It's not that the drinks are particularly creative or particularly tasty, although their mimosas are far from disgusting. It's that their drinks are potent and plentiful, and in this city what more can you ask for? But lest you think I go just to throw back shots of orange juice-flavored sparkling wine and complain about how the neighborhood's not what it used to be (like I'd know), the food itself is fantastic. You pay $18 for a prix fixe menu and ""three"" complimentary drinks. In reality, they'll top you up like it's water. The food is solid, hearty brunch food with the slightest tweak to send it to the next level. I always get The Aristocrat ($2 extra), which is poached eggs, gravlax, and salmon roe over their specialty, potato pancakes, served with a small salad and sour cream. Friends that I've gone with have ordered the omelets and the mexican matzo brei and no plate has gone back unlicked. OK, I exaggerate. Only a little.I've only been once for dinner during a $1 oyster night (accompanied with the tartare trio and -- of course -- potato pancake w/ salmon) and it was pleasant enough. The oysters were fresh, though on the small side -- basically, you get what you pay for.  I much prefer the casual vibe of brunch, although it does get jam-packed and noisy and there isn't a real waiting area. The place gets tons of light which stops you from feeling stifled in such a small, crowded restaurant. In short: bring cash, bring friends, and be prepared to wait.

5.0,7/3/2010,"Love love love Essex!  Was in town from D.C. and 3 of my local friends recommended Essex for brunch.  My friends have good taste - it was fabulous.  If I tried to envision what I want in a brunch place, this is it. The space is great, the scene is fun, the drinks are flowing, and - even better - I wanted everything on the menu. Ended up with steak and eggs.  So so good - perfectly done and a great cut of meat. And eggs. And 3 drinks. For $20? I mean seriously.Went back another time for dinner - totally different vibe and another amazing menu. It's what tons of chefs try for and don't quite reach;  food that's inventive and interesting - your old favorites with a twist - but isn't trying so hard to be hip that it's over the top. This is seriously fantastic food - and I want more of it. Try the caprese salad - the homemade mozzarella is melt in your mouth amazing.

1.0,7/1/2010,"Been here dozen of times, especially for the $1 oyster special.Last Thursday, 8 of us went to have oysters and 5 of us got food poisoning the following Saturday. Body aching, etc and some of us were sick up to 4 days later...I won't begin to get into it. For those of you that have unfortunately experienced food poisoning, you get it. Those of our party that didn't get sick seemed to have not eaten the last plate that was served to us.Once I called the manager to let him know, he completely got defensive and was pretty much accusing me of lying saying that if it was food poisoning it would have happened the next day. Excuse me, we did our research and it can hit up to 72 hours later and for 5 of the 8 of us to feel the exact same symptoms on the same day. Hmmmmmm? A little more than a coincidence, don't you think? Another thing he said was something to the effect of we serve over 200 oysters in a night and only 5 of you got sick so what am I supposed to do? I mean really? How bout you handle your food correctly?Because they have this special every week, they need to know to be really careful of what they are serving their customers and how they handle raw food.

I've been to brunch a few times and never had a hassle. Even the time they needed our table (way after we had finished our meal and really were just sitting around talking at that point), the hostess apologized, asked if we minded moving to the bar and gave us a whole row of drink tickets. This after a non-stop waterfall of mimosas. Now that's service! Can't really say the same about dinner though. The few times I did have dinner there, I was less than thrilled with my entrees. The blackened catfish over shrimp was dry and salty. I didn't even make it halfway through. And although the Wednesday night lobster special was good, I've actually been to places with even better deals.  HH however, is great. Half off drink specials until 9pm. We've made it one of our regular Thursday night spots. Most of the drinks on the menu are great. I'm on a mojito kick and mango is my current favorite. Not too crazy about the jalapeno mojito though. As far as appetizers go, I can only say this about what I've tried...- trio of steak, tuna, & salmon tartare: yummy. Yummy every time I've ordered it...and for those of you that are iffy with steak tartare (or any of them for that matter), I've asked them to switch it out for either another salmon or tuna and they're really good about doing so. - the fried calamari is eh as far as calamari goes, but the habanero-avocado dip that it comes with makes it a little more worth getting. - jumbo lump crabcake over hears of palm salad: although not that jumbo, is still yummy. - short ribs over polenta in a porcini mushroom sauce: in my opinion, everyone should try this. It was that good. Portion size wasn't bad either. - seared diver scallops over croutons, watermelon, roasted peaches & basil: really good. The scallops were done just right and the watermelon & roasted peaches sitting on top complemented it so well. - cheeseburger empanadas: a little on the dry side.

What a bummer and my bad for not reading the fine print! Since they couldn't cut us a break I ended up giving my Groupons away. We were the first ones to get there and we were seated at one of the smaller tables by the bar.  We ordered cocktails at half off - $5 for a Blood Orange Cosmo and a Ginger Pear Saketini. Let's just say my friend and I were both tipsy from 1 drink each - either we're lightweights (high probability) or they were generous with the alcohol. The drinks were good - mixed well and almost couldn't taste the alcohol. We had: Potato Cake Napoleon, Mussels in a white wine sauce with garlic with a side of fries, and the special of the day Lobster and rock shrimp ravioli with a white cream sauce. The Lower East Side doesn't disappoint - good value for the dollar. Potato Cake was delicious - came with asparagus and other veggies and the texture of the cake itself was soft but with semi-crunchy edges. Mussels are my favorite so I ended up finishing the whole pot myself and shared a few with my friends. These mussels aren't the big/tough/rubbery kind - it was the petite small tender juicy kind. I drenched my fries and bread in the broth. It was a never ending pile of shells of which the waiter kept switching out. It would have been great having an empty bowl to put all the oysters as oppose to a small plate. Lastly, the ravioli was surprisingly light considering it was covered in a cream sauce. There were 4 huge raviolis on the plate with rock shrimp and some other seafood on top. We were provided a fine meal and we were satisfied. No room for dessert and no tolerance for extra drinks.

3.0,4/27/2010,"Groupon on vacation! I had originally bought 2 groupons for this restaurant because we were planning on having 4 people. When our 4th couldn't make it, we technically could only use 1 groupon. I explained the situation to the waitress, that we were from out of town, could we still use the second groupon. She looked at me blankly. Ok.... We sat on the second level balcony, which was prime for people watching at the bar. Our waitress was a little goofy, I think she was new. I was also a little disappointed that we were basically at a two top with three chairs, but we love each other so closeness is ok. Thurs night = half price drinks and $1 oysters. I had two watermelon martinis that were yummy (even though the second had a lot more booze) and tasted my friends' blood orange cosmo and green zinger (green tea vodka, pimm's, mint and lime) which were both tasty. I started with the warm goat cheese salad with beets that was fantastic. The beets were slices covered with toasty warm goat cheese. I wanted everything on the menu, but decided to share the three ways potato pancakes. Can I just say, I have never had a deep fried potato pancake? I was expecting something crispy but thin. This was super crunch on the outside and really greasy. And I don't recall goat cheese on the one that was supposed to have it. I also ordered a side of plantains that came with a salsa with hearts of palm, onion and tomato. It was a nice salsa, but plantains need sour cream. They just do. My fellow diners had mixed feelings about the food as well.

Brilliant!!! In my opinion, this fact alone is the draw of this place - but the food is also pretty good to boot.  My eggs benedict was very tasty but admittedly not any more distinctive than what's served at other brunch spots.  My friend, however, ordered the Mac n' Cheese with Chicken Apple sausage and  although we were already really full from all the food and drinks, we wanted seconds (esp. the sausage!).  We also ordered a side of the potato pancakes with apple sauce and it was a delectable combo of savory & sweet flavors.One more piece of advice before you go....brunch is cash only, so make sure to hit up the ATM prior to getting there!",2,1,0,Joanne L.,"Wantagh, NY",16,29,1

First, she plopped down my martini glass on our crooked table and just stood watching me repeatedly move it so it wouldn't slide off... and when it inevitably got jostled and spilled all over the table, i had to flag her down and even though I specifically requested a wet rag, she gave me an adjacent table's napkin and made me clean it myself.  On top of that, she was really overselling (unconvincingly) to the point of telling me that a dish had ""a lot of flavor!"" Uh... great. It's a flipping restaurant. I hope it has flavor.Another thing that really ticked me off was even though we had a reservation for 2, we got seated at a table of 2, set for 2... with an extra chair.

(Plus, the hostess looks uncannily like Natalie Portman. Very striking)Service was nothing to rave about, but it was adequate. I had refills when I needed them and our food came relatively quickly. They take orders on a touch screen phone, so we actually thought our server was being really rude and unprofessional when she walked up to our table, until we realized what she was doing! Startled us, but it's a cool idea.$18 prixe fixe, an entree and 3 mimosas/bloody marys/screwdrivers. I wish that they were bottomless, I really do. The mimosas were all right, not as good as some I've had, but not awful. They're not true sticklers for when they cut you off, some of the my friends had a fourth refill, but I, oddly, was cut off at three. It's not consistent, so it made me a little peeved that my friends had four and I only had three. But, nothing that brought me down from the great experience.I had banana chocolate pancakes, and they were quite ingenious! Usually the mix-in's in pancakes are quite visible and sink to the bottom-- but these were almost like stuffed pancakes! I don't know how they managed to keep it all so centralized, but it was delicious. Fluffy and a great ratio of ""mix-in's.""

Very efficient in that aspect.  If you go, I would always recommend that you make a reservation through Open Table, otherwise you might get stuck waiting in that awful entry way (next to the smelly bathroom) with pushy pepole for a very looooong time.  Also, try and get a table on one of the upstairs balconies.",0,0,1,Step C.,"New York, NY",34,36,2

It also helped that i had a Groupon coupon. We ordered a dozen bluepoint oysters for $12. She had the blackened catfish over shrimp, potatoes and scallion hash. The catfish was cooked and seasoned perfectly. It was very moist and flavorful. Usually when i try catfish at other establishments, they tend to overcook it and it tends to be very dry. This was flaky, moist, and succulent. The shrimp were cooked well too. I didn't try the hash, so I can't comment on that. I ordered the colorado lamb chops with sauteed spinach and ricotta gnocchi. The lamb chops were cooked a beautiful medium rare. The crust of the chops were a tad over seasoned with the salt, but it was still very tasty.  The spinach with mushrooms had a nice flavor.

Is it really worth it if your waitress is going to tell you that you need to hurry up and order and can still get your free drinks but have to have them at the bar which is crowded with terrible people? I THINK NOT!  And the food was.... fine. I had a standard lox benedict with potatoes. But unfortunately, ""fine"" food for a place like this is just not good enough. Look, if I can't talk you out of going to this place (you have some friends that just OMG OMG ""HAVE"" to try it) just make sure you arrive with a full stomach and bring an Encyclopedia to read while you wait. Prepare yourself for the likely possibility that you're going to have a waiter/waitress that sucks.

3.0,3/7/2010,"A little disappointed with my brunch experience here, probably because I was expecting it to be amazing. I ordered the crispy potato pancakes, which were good, but not particularly impressive in my opinion. I kind of wish I had ordered something else after I started eating it. The mimosas though were fantastic and definitely heavy on the champagne =P. We didn't get our full 3 glasses so our waitress gave us drink tickets for the bar. It was kind of obvious at the end that we were being pushed out as our waitress kept coming back as we were finishing our drinks to take some plates away, to take some silverware away; etc. I'm also not a fan of their cash-only policy for brunch. The space itself is bright and trendy, with an industrial feel. There definitely started to be a crowd out the door as we were leaving, so try to make a reservation or you might have to wait awhile to get seated. And don't worry about coming before noon on Sunday, there's complimentary coffee/tea/soda before noon until they can serve you your alcohol =).",0,0,0,Vivian L.,"San Francisco, CA",153,330,43

TWO HOURS LATER (there has never been a case more suitable than this for allcaps) fatigued and broke because we spent all our money on $3 mimosas at the bar (cheap, but we had many) we finally resorted to taking one of those little tables across from the bar. So we waited two hours only to be seated in the crowded waiting area. Fail.I ordered steak and eggs, medium rare, and it came out without a hint of pink. I have no qualms about getting the food the way I want it when I'm sober, much less after 7+ mimosas, so I sent it back and another came out fine.The waitress was incredibly considerate and attentive. My mimosa glass was never empty. She earned this place 2 stars. The 3rd is for the hollandaise.Good food, good atmosphere (ladies on the prowl, go with a girl friend, you are sure to get chatted up) and good price (as long as you don't spend all your $$ at the bar during the wait) but either make a reservation the day before or go with a big group cause it was absolutely not worth the hell we went through.",1,0,0,Courtney D.,"Brooklyn, NY",29,35,0

1.0,2/21/2010,"We had reservations last night at 7pm. Waited at the bar after letting the hostess know we would like to sit. Strawberry mojito was watery and tasteless, kettle soda not strong enough. Mango mojito was better but needs improvement as well. By 7:15 and 2 walks over to the hostess stand (about 5 other tables were already sat) we were still waiting for our table. I was totally ignored and was told one more minute. The place was empty so i didn't understand the wait. Finally we were brought upstairs to an empty section and shown to a 2 top, there were three of us. I can understand if the place was packed but if the restaurant is empty we want a table we can fit more than 2 plates on. We informed the hostess that the table was unacceptable and received an argument and nasty attitude from her.

Bringing a big group is probably better and you'll have a lot more fun, especially with bottomless brunch cocktails (3 drink limit but they lose track from all the refilling they do). Makes for great conversation in an already noisy establishment. The Bloody Mary here is bloody good!Trendy crowd. Walking through the group of people waiting to be seated at the bar, you could feel the ego in the room. Good music, funky arthouse vibe in a space that feels like a warehouse.Great, lively atmosphere. Tall ceilings with 2nd level dining on both sides of the restaurant.

2.0,2/5/2010,"My girlfriend and I went to this restaurant for dinner yesterday. That being said we arrived at about a quarter to 6 for a 6pm reservation. It's a nice cozy atmosphere. The bar tender/waiter told us immedeately and rudely that they were closed when we checked-in until we told him we had a reservation. He looked like we were bothering him. We sat and waited at the bar until they opened and were seated at about 6:10, but the kitchen didn't open until 6:30. We were seated in a section that was apparently reserved for a party that we were not invited to so we moved. The waitress couldn't give recommendations because she was a vegitarian (but she and the hostess were the nicest people there, but no common sense). The food took forever to arrive and wasn't that great. The check took even longer (about 40 min.) and the waitress didn't look twice or say ""thanks for coming out"", ""its not you its me"", or ""I hope you die"", or anything as we left. The staff acted like they were all millionares and this was just a part-time gig and I should be so glad that I was graced with their presence.Also while we were there a chick slipped and hurt her neck on the floor and had to be taken to the hospital, guess the floors are also slippery.

3.0,1/30/2010,"With specials everyday except for Fridays including Oysters, Mussels, Maine lobster, Brunch and Drinks looks like Essex has opted for calling attention of New Yorkers with great deals. Brunch is the headline at Essex, as shows that more than 70% of the reviews describe brunch experiences; and having take a look to some of them I'll keep on mind Alex C. quote ""went there for brunch. food, 3 stars.  price, 5 stars"". Since during regular brunch time Essex is packed I like the fact that they offer a Sunday Sundown brunch starting at 4pm until 8pm. But talking about my times at Essex my rate is actually 4 for the Lobster night, but 2 star for drinks that happened randomly on a Friday night because Le Lupanar was totally empty.  On Wednesdays night you can have one Lobster, served whole in the shell, for just $16 coming with corn on cob and potatoes and if you go between 6 to 9pm you can also have half price drinks; which actually happen from Monday through Thursday. That night our server extended us the special price for drinks after 9pm. Our lobster was juicy, tasty and well cooked; very tender and fresh. The size is enough for dinner, will not induce food coma, tho. Our waitress was very friendly but a bit slow. Essex has an upstairs level to be seated which has the disadvantage that the servers will not be frequently around and if you need them you will have to go downstairs or just wait. The place was packed and I think there isn't too many servers to handle it. We were waiting in the bar area until our party was complete and a bit more until our table was ready even although we had a reservation. I didn't mind at all that day since the waiting time at the bar was nice.  Don't miss to take a look around; I loved it. Open space, Loft type and impressive luminosity that will not bother you. Walls and ceiling are creamy-white but they did a great job with the contrasting furniture, very modern and in dark wooden, dark floor and even a red wall; white lamps however and tall plants in green that I always like to see. I find downstairs dinning room perfect for a group of friends but although not having servers around could be a disadvantage, I still prefer the terrace upstairs for intimacy, the lighting is just soft, giant windows, transparent curtains. Dating space. A friend of mine have been there several times for the Oyster special night and he keeps telling that is really good as well. The same friend however was back for the lobster another Wednesday and they run out that night having to order items from the regular menu and he wasn't that impressed. This fact has been stopping me to go back and try something different.   The wine list is really good. I can recognize some good Spanish wines, I was happy to taste a Rosé ""Marqués de Cáceres"" from La Rioja. Its an sparkling wine served in a flute glass, sour and sweet. Of course Pinot, Chardonnay, the regular types but also Zinfandel wines, the variete Shiraz, Albariño, my favorite white wine and if you like bubbles you have several Champagnes to order . Drinks other than wine are pretty standard, either during the happy hour or any other time. My vodka with cranberries during the Happy Hour was served with too much ice. During our random drinks night I tried the Ginger Pear Sakétini and although I liked it, the flavor wasn't well balanced to my taste. It was very strong. I think they used dry Sake. The Strawberry Cream Martini had a weird flavor. With prices between $9 to $11 is not expensive but having around places as White Star, same price but a recognized speakeasy as good as M&H, I don't have any doubt about what should be my destination.    The place was always loud, in particular that Friday night and the crowd was in their 20s and 30s, mostly groups separate by genders, flirting between each other [wink] Based in my visits to Essex and reading others reviews my mental resume should be: Yes for lobster. Always book a table. The service has things to improve. Maybe brunch and if this happen will be late on Sundays.

Since I had just ran a 1/2 marathon that morning, nothing sounded more disgusting than alcohol so maybe this review will deserve a revisit on the point of sheer value for alcohol consumption. Maybe the nasty, sub-par food becomes edible after 3 beverages.I hate the layout of this restaurant, the huge crowd waiting by the bar, and how this is the most unrelaxing place to ever have a leisurely brunch experience. Even when you are in the upstairs area, you feel smooshed. And I hate to smoosh with people i don't know!Brunch is served on Saturday and Sunday from 11:30am-4:30pm and then they also have ""Sunday Sundown"" brunch from 4:30pm-8:00pm. Again, the main draw is definitely the drinks. The food was disgusting. It was like greasy eggs, nasty potatoes. Fruit salad that was mushy and not fresh. I ate maybe 4 bites and didn't bother to look at the rest. Will try to give it one more chance, but basically the two stars are for the facts you can make brunch reservations online through OT (rare) and the other is the service is really friendly and not the typical disenchanted hipster I tend to find (and really dislike) in this area.

Both times, we have been underwhelmed by both dishes.For the Deep South, the biscuit was dry and a far cry from the buttery delights of actual southern cuisine, the steak was dry, and neither could recover because they did not put on enough gravy!!!For the Aristocrat, the eggs were over-poached to the point that the yolk of the egg was solid.The ambiance and energy is great once you have a table, but the food is not worth it.

Good thing my mexican omelette style dish was gigantic! Complete with beans and everything else all folded in, I was happy that Matt had to help me out with this one! And their pancakes??

The menu is a combination of brunch and dinner and you also get three drinks (your choice between a bloody mary, screwdriver and/or mimosa) during the course of the meal.  For starters, we ordered the fried calamari with a habenero-avocado sauce and the potato pancake sampler.  I really liked the calamari--i could have just ordered that for myself and be happy, but i shared with everyone.  The potato pancakes were pretty good.  I wasn't a big fan of the goat cheese, but everyone else seemed to like it.  My favorite was the gravlax. As for the main course, it was a hard choice to make after looking over the menu.  It all looked pretty good, but in the end, I chose the wasabi-crusted salmon with the braised veggies. The portion was a little small, compared to the other dishes--it made me feel a little inadequate.  At least the salmon was fantastic--it was cooked perfectly to my liking and the crust was amazing and not at all sinus-clearing spicy.  In the end, I had a pleasant experience.  I really didn't have a big issue with making reservations, like some other people seem to have. Yeah, I had to wait like an extra 20-25 minutes or so, but we were a pretty big group and they needed just one table, and those folks at that table were just saddling up by the time I got there.  And we were waiting for 2 other people to arrive and they finally did right when we were getting seated.

I'm only docking a point for the mediocre service).  The eggs in my dish were super overcooked... almost rubbery.  The potato pancakes that my friend got as a side ($4) weren't much bigger than potato chips.  Some of the food that I saw coming out looked half-way decent, which made me regret my order (the Southern breakfast).  But still, if you can't cook eggs, you shouldn't serve brunch.The only point in returning would be to get drunk on $3 brunch drinks at the bar, but then, that's probably never going to happen.  Maybe 10 years ago when I thought drunkenness was super rad.  The $18 brunch is definitely NOT worth it.  Not worth the wait, not worth your money, not worth your stomach real estate.",0,0,0,Evan W.,"Manhattan, NY",24,87,8
4.0,10/31/2009,"My foodie road dog, and I decided to have Brunch at Essex.  I rarely travel below Houston St., so I was looking forward to this trip to the L to the E to the S! I knew in advance to make a reservation. So I went to handy dandy Opentable to make a reservation.  Even though I secured a reservation I knew I would still have to wait.  So be forewarned - a reservation will get you in, but not necessarily at the time you booked.  If you have after Brunch plans, please be sure to manage your time wisely. Essex's entrance is located on Rivington St., despite an Essex St. address.  This entrance was formally the northern entrance to the Essex Street Market.  Once you turn the corner onto Rivington, you know you've arrived, as you'll be met by a swarm of people waiting to be seated. I fought my way to the hostess stand, in the middle of the restaurant, and was told it would be another 10/15 min. Not bad as I expected an minimum of one hour.  I used the time to check out the space. Once you're inside the restaurant space is light and airy, thanks to the large windows on the Essex street side of the building.  To your right is a big well stocked bar, straight a head are the main dining and rear loft dining areas.  Above the entrance is the front loft dining space.Opposite the bar is the ""tennis ball"" art piece, which I fail to ""get"".  I'm pretty quick and usually get modern art, but I need translation for this piece.  This piece looks like a double fault to me!  We're seated at a table on the rear dining loft.  Even though noise rises, I feel the loft spaces are not as loud as the lower level.  Our Server Cat (who might I add was fab-u-lous) greets us and gives us the rundown on how brunch works.  Before we had to time to thank her, two mimosas appeared, hey it doesn't hurt to sit next to the bar.My friend ordered the Eggs Benedict and I ordered a salad, one egg over easy, a side of chicken apple sausage and an order of plain pancakes. My salad arrived, it was nice light and refreshing.While awaiting our entrees we struck up a convo with the ladies next to us.  One ordered the Mexican scramble, and claimed it is super popular.  The other order the French Toast and for a minute I wondered if I made a mistake as the French Toast looked sooooo fluffy and light.  She said that the French Toast was really good, but the sauce was way too sweet for her taste.Our entree's arrived, sans the egg and sausage.  A few minutes later the sausage arrive.  About five minutes later a rock hard fried egg appeared and was quickly sent back. The egg returned and finally I just told our server to take it off the menu.  How can you not prepare an egg over easy??  The Eggs Benedict smelled wonderful and my pancakes were huge, light and fluffy.  They get a solid 9.  If the butter was softer and syrup warm, they would have received a perfect 10.    I was underwhelmed by the chicken Apple Sausage, as I've had better.Overall this is a nice spot and despite the minor snafu's the food is solid and very good portions for the price. I would head here again as I like the fast paced energy and free cocktails.  If you're looking for a laid back brunch spot, this is not the place.Note:  Brunch is Ca$h only.",0,0,0,KennecteD ..,"New York, NY",47,102,432

3.0,10/21/2009,"Per some friends' suggestions, my first food stop after getting off the plane at LGA was to hit up Essex for brunch. I was assured it was a solid value and there were plentiful mimosas. Sounds good to me; sign me up! I was also warned about the wait (even with a reservation, which we had). No big deal. I wasn't THAT hungry anyway! It's all good because there's some prime people watching in here. Those on post-date meals, those on first dates, gal pals in to gab, it trended to the young and not-so-family oriented. Oh, and this isn't the place to have a quiet intimate brunch, as it gets a little noisy in here.About twenty minutes after our reservation time, we were seated in the upper loft portion of this lively, industrial like space (curiously decorated by tennis balls on the exposed white brick walls). Great, a better people watching vantage point! Unfortunately I wasn't drinking (some freak hormonal thing I've since taken care of), so I was stuck drinking OJ in this mimosa wonderland. Unfortunately, their OJ is only okay in the mimosas, as this was maybe two clicks above Tang on the juice spectrum. Oh well. It was wet and didn't taste horrible. I could manage. My friend, on the other hand, enjoyed her mimosas thoroughly (and even got started early at the bar while we waited to be seated)Being the chorizo whore I am, I ordered the CEO (which I guess is short for chorizo, eggs and onions). It was served with corn tortillas so I could kinda make my own lil breakfast tacos. The food wasn't GREAT but it wasn't bad either. Just good enough for me to eat it and not complain, I guess. My friend had some salad with chicken and pumpkin seeds that she was raving about, so at least she was happy with her food.I think I'd enjoy this place a lot more if they upgraded to real OJ (and kept that as refilled as the mimosas) or I could belly up and enjoy the cocktail portion of the meal. And maybe pick some other brunch delicacy as my choice was just alright. So far, it's not bad, not great. Just adequate.

A DJ spun that night, filling the open, well-ventilated space with low-key tunes. Low-key was good, as we could easily carry on a conversation. Definitely a relaxing place to lounge.A flatscreen above the bar played sports, without sound - do those things need to be everywhere?Our accommodating - and super cute - pixie of a waitress told us her name was Kat.

However, you can't beat the practically bottomless drinks, which come to your table faster than you can ask for another. And the drinks are quite strong!My two largest beef(s?) with this place:1) Our waitress rushed our ordering and rolled her eyes when she left the table. Yes, I know Essex is busy, but at the time, Essex was not. And her behavior was off-putting. 2) This place takes itself so seriously. There are staunch rules about changing your party number and how much you're charged if X% of your party is missing.

4.0,9/1/2009,"Very trendy place in the same building (but separate entrance) as the Essex Market. The brunch is their biggest draw but unless you go on Sunday before they can legally serve alcohol the wait is ridiculous. The brunch is $18 and comes with 3 drinks but it doesn't seem they were really keeping track of how many they were pouring when I went (that's a good thing). The biscuits and gravy were good but was just a small side of the dish with a small portion. The place is beautiful, especially when you get to sit at one of the lofts and overlook the whole place. The food was nothing amazing but it wasn't disappointing either. If the lines weren't so long I'd definitely make a couple more return trips.UPDATE: I came back for dinner with a Groupon-like deal. I had a great scallop and risotto meal and my girlfriend loved her burger. We split a lobster mac and cheese that was packed with fresh lobster meat.

She always had a smile on her face, and if I were her...weaving in and out of the hungry masses of pissed off people waiting to eat...I would be a lot less sweet. We had to wait about a half hour for brunch which was fine, we totally understood but when we attempted to order drinks for the bartender..he was kept telling us we had to wait and that there were many people waiting..and never came back to our group and was very rude when we kept asking if we can order drinks, just grunting and not responding to me. There were only about 12 people around the bar at this point.  I honestly felt like he wanted to lose costumers. In fact if you go into Essex and see a short, balding man behind the bar flip him off for me. I couldnt believe how rude he was.

The place is located in a loft restaurant with two upstair lofts and a central area, all decorated in modern decor. They have quite a selection of brunch items that can be ordered and it is $18 with three mimosas. My first mimosa was warm which I find unacceptable. Just like white wine should always be chilled to really get the right flavor, champagne is the same way. I was forced to put ice in it because I just cant drink a warm mimosa even though I would normally never put ice in it. The mimosa pitcher should definitely be placed on ice if not being served immediately. The refills all came chilled thankfully and they filled them well. Throughout brunch, you could hear the pop of the champagne bottles being opened.We were served onion bread while waiting which Im not too fond of (dont like the onions) but I ate regardless as I was hungry.  I ordered three softly scrambled eggs and chicken sausage which tasted quite yummy. I would say that they overcooked my eggs though. I like them very lightly scrambled so they are fluffy and soft.

I ordered Potato Cake Napoleon Layered with (sautéed spinach, shitake mushrooms, asparagus & truffle oil). Describe as three potato pancakes staked with mushrooms, spinach and asparagus layered between them. To begin, the dish arrived cold. At this point there is no need to discuss the under/over cooked veggies or the greasy flavorless potato pancakes because cold food is just unacceptable. The taste of truffle oil was oddly missing. Oddly because it practically ruined my boyfriend's side dish that didn't mention having truffle oil in it. My boyfriend had the Grilled Half-chicken (with mixed vegetables & porcini mashed potatoes). This is dish that if you cook it incorrectly, speaks volumes about your entire menu. It's grilled chicken, and what we received tasted boiled without seasoning and left outside to dry in the sun. The final touch was the truffle oil that was mistakenly left out of my dish an showed up in his mashed potatoes rendering them inedible. Sorry Essex, the meal was so embarrassing, we can't even give you a second chance.",0,0,0,Elizabeth C.,"Manhattan, NY",28,50,0

Essex has a great selection of entrees ranging from $16 to $20 and you get pretty much as much as you can drink while you are there. Arriving later in the afternoon works to your advantage as you aren't hurried out the door as fast but the cut off time of 4:30 quickly approaches. Everyone at our table tried something different. I had the southern because who doesn't enjoy sausage and white gravy! Good home cooking your mama would approve of! When I go back I am so having the crab cake benedict. I don't think my friend enjoyed me staring at her meal so intently. With most of the meals you get a green salad and homefries. I tried the homefries but was not as impressed as they had a red pepper taste to them. I guess they use that instead of ketchup for the stickiness effect.

4.0,4/13/2009,"This review is only for the brunch. I love this place for three reasons. 1. Unlimited Cocktails! First of all, the Prix Fixe brunch with unlimited drinks has to be the greatest of all God's creations. I know technically you only get 3 drinks in the Essex brunch plan but I've never left with fewer than 4 screwdrivers floating amiably in my stomach. It's pretty easy to get unlimited cocktails but do you really need to start off your Sunday with more than three strong vodka drinks? Yeah me too.2. They have screwdrivers. Almost every other ""booze included"" brunch plan limits your options to wussy mimosas or dreaded bloody marys. I hate bloody marys. Also, I'm not a scientist but I'm pretty sure that the shot of vodka in the Mary is way more alcoholic than the splash of cheap champagne in a mimosa. Any brunch plan that understands that alcohol dependency doesn't always go hand in hand with a love of tomato juice get's a thumbs up from me!3. The food is great. The menu has a wide variety of options but I generally stick to the Mexican Matzo Brei because it is so freaking good. I'm a sucker for Mexi breakfast options and the Essex really hits the spot. The potatoes are wonderful as well. Oh! and you get free Bialy type roll jam packed with onions before your meal. The only problems I have with this place are the crowds and occasionally the service. If you sit in or near the bar you are going to be surrounded by the hundreds of thousands of people waiting for their table and it can be a bit uncomfortable. Those loitering masses are also probably the reason why the servers seem at times confused and overwhelmed. Don't worry this is only a problem while you are sober.

Now even though the wait is long, the food gets to the table soon, and for $16 w/o tip, you get three cups of alcohol, you can choose between a Mimosa, Bloody Mary, or Screwdriver, for the non alcoholics there are Orange Juice... and of course water. The deal is this, if you switch drinks from the original you order with then there is a surcharge, personally, I enjoyed the screw driver with a French toast dish. This place has a website that you can make reservations online, so if you want breakfast with alcohol, then this is the place for you! also if you make the reservations, and not the right amount of people showed up, they can apparently charge you for about $20 a missing person. That's what my acquaintance said, after two of my other friends didn't make it.

The food tasted good. Did the mimosas cloud my better judgment? I'm not sure, but the warm and fuzzy alcohol related emotions could not disguise the frozen onion bread and cold butter served as a starter.

They won't seat you until everyone is there, so we had to make them wait nearly half an hour until one of friends got there. Once he arrived, they seated us immediately. It was pretty impressive considering the huge line.The Mexican Matzo Brei was SO great. It's basically this eggs, black beans and matzo pile with a side of avocado and tomato salsa. Delicious. One of my friends got the potato pancake dish with apples and honey cream sauce, and it was amaaazing. We all really enjoyed our food, and the drinks weren't bad either.After we paid, a couple of my friends were planning to meet up for a mimosa. They needed our table, so the waitress gave us a few free drink tickets to make up for the inconvenience. So nice! We got seats at the bar downstairs and had a great time.

While I'd like to say this was fantastic, it was honestly kinda weird.  There was a strong bitter taste and the mint was reminiscent of a Mojito gone awry.  I chose wine as my other drink, and was happy with my selection.  Overall, they do have an interesting and pretty extensive cocktail menu.  Surely many of the drinks are yummy.  I just chose wrong.We started our meal with something healthy to share, the Cheeseburger Empanadas, which were loaded with cheesy and beefy goodness with a dipping sauce to boot.  Next, I had the Roasted Duck Breast with duck spring roll, which was tasty and cooked well.  It was fun to have the spring roll in addition to the sliced duck breast.  Two people at the table had the Herbed Colorado Lamb Chops over sauteed spinach and ricotta gnocchi.  I didn't taste the lamb, although both friends enjoyed it.  I did try the gnocchi, because they had been prepared in a way I hadn't really come across- Cooked, maybe fried, they looked like little browned dough balls and tasted great!  Very interesting side dish.  Lastly, my friend tried the Goat Cheese Stuffed Chicken Breast with asparagus and roasted potatoes.  This was a yummy dish, and as my friend is a huge fan of sweet potato fries, they let her substitute that in for the potatoes.   For dessert, we all shared a piece of the Peanut Butter ""Sigh"" Pie, and boy was that good.  I think the sigh must be the feeling of relief from opening your pants.  Very rich, very tasty, very good!Overall, a nice meal at a nice restaurant.",3,3,4,Gretchen W.,"New York, NY",40,121,7

Dishes were: Ribeye Steak with eggs, The Aristocrat, mac & cheese, and eggs benedict with salmon.  We received complimentary bread while we tried to decide on what to order.  The bread was horrible.  It was a type of jewish bread made with a lot of onions in the middle and garlic on top.  It was an innovative touch to the regular bread basket but it's not something I would go back for.  Too much onion in the middle and the onions carried such a pungent flavor that it tasted more like onion then bread.The eggs benedict was okay; it was decent.  You can never mess up eggs benedict since it's such an easy dish.  They gave a salad and potatoes on the side.  The potatoes was not good, instead of regular potatoes, they make their potatoes with a spicy sauce that do NOT mix with the eggs benedict.  Ribeye steak with eggs:  was an extra $2.  The ribeye steak was so very thin, totally not worth a $18 brunch item.  It looked more like flank steak plus it was not seasoned and cooked well, so the steak actually came out to be very old and no flavored once chewed into.The Aristocrat: an extra $2.  This was an innovative dish of Eggs Benedict except that the poached egg had no holladise sauce and the english muffin was subsitituted for a potato pancake.  The potato pancake was really good, although it was a bit greasy, but it tasted exactly like a big hash brown.  Mac & cheese:  made with Mosiago cheese.  was really good.  I believe this was one of my favorite dishes.

2.0,11/24/2008,"This is a review for the Essex brunch. I've never been here at night so I can't comment on that. I'm a little ashamed to say that I've done this brunch twice now, and have tried to do it three times. The first time was pretty decent, and I got a nice buzz on from unlimited mimosas, which were actually refilled often, and ate some decent brunch food. It was loud and we had to wait about 15 minutes to be seated, but overall it was a pleasant experience. The second time I tried to do brunch here with a larger group (6) and we tried calling ahead from about 11am on and no one would answer the phone to take a reservation, so we figured we'd just go down there and see if we could get in. We arrived at about 2:30pm and they told us it'd be over an hour wait. Yuck. So we moved on and went elsewhere...Recently the BF and I decided to try our luck again thinking, since we were just a couple like the first time we'd be able to get seated faster. Again we tried to call but no one would answer the phone. We arrived at Essex at 12:15pm and were told we could be seated in 45 minutes so we decided to put our names in and wait around. Well 45 minutes came and went and we weren't called to be seated. Meanwhile many many groups came in after us and were seated. After another 10 minutes, we inquired with one of the hostesses just to make sure we were still on the list and she told us that yes, she had one party before us and we'd be next. OK, so we continue to wait....After a few minutes she came over and told us that actually there were two lists and laughed like ""oh, hehe, silly us...."" but there was no apology or food forthcoming. Finally BF went to talked to the other hostess (the one who originally quoted us 45 minutes) and explained that we'd be waiting an hour and a half. She seated us right away and we were served.So, moral of the story, the food here is pretty OK and you can get unlimited booze. However, they serve no booze before noon, and anytime after noon it is so busy you will not be able to get anyone on the staffs attention. The servers are completely outnumbered, and it's just chaos.

Sadly, if you are a busy graduate student with lots of work to do, getting sloshed at noon may not be the best way to start your day.Things I liked:1. The Mimosas. Pre-made? Who cares! Champagne tastes good at any time!2. The chocolate pancakes with banana comfit. Do you like your breakfast sugary and full of calories? This one is the way to go!3. The crabcake eggs Benedict. Really a pretty good deal. Crabcakes on their own are often $16 and this meal comes with the english muffin, eggs, arugula salad and home fries. Plus the aforementioned mimosas.4. Supposedly you get 3 glasses free with your $16 meal. I think I had 5. The good thing about pre-mixed drinks is that they have a pitcher..and they just kept refilling our glasses. Yikes!Things I did not like:1. We had to wait almost an hour to get seated. This is AFTER we tried to make reservations, were told they did not accept them and then see people waltzing in the next day to claim their spots. Hm. Maybe you can only make reservations if you're special?2. It's really crowded and they're obviously trying to flip tables as quickly as possible.

Since they couldn't kick them out we had to wait.Half an hour passes and at this time the host asks us if we wouldn't prefer to just eat at the bar since it is open. I say we prefer to sit at a table since we haven't seen each other in a long time and want to catch up. So then 45 minutes go by and the host comes up to us and says he feels really bad we have been waiting so long, so he tells us to sit at the bar AND ORDER ANYTHING ON THE MENU FOR FREE-- there is such a thing as a free meal!!! So we get our mimosas (which the bartender kept refilling every 5 minutes), I order the crispy potato pancakes with sauteed apples and honey cream sauce and spinach-shitake black bean hash. I only ate the potato pancake (I am such a big fan of potato pancakes!) I am not a big veggie eater, so I left that to my brother. It was soooo good! My brother ordered the salmon platter (what else would you want to eat newly arrived in NYC?!) and it came with this white fish spread which I had never tried-- spectacular! So we left completely smashed and vowed to bring our jewish mom back for the potato pancake and chala french toast... Our second time at Essex for brunch was much easier to be seated. I ordered the mac and cheese-- so gooey and cheesey and delish! The chicken apple sausage tasted like chicken-apple--haha- amazing! SO GOOD! One of the people who was with us that day is alergic to literally anything and everything, and our waitress was so nice, she kept going back and forth from the kicthen to our table to try and find something our friend could eat without dying or chocking.... She ended up just having eggs and fruit. They were so cool about it though, and very helpful. Definitely one of the best places for brunch since there will be something for everyone!OH- and BRUNCH IS CASH ONLY!",4,2,3,Nicole C.,"New York, NY",124,299,3

Admittedly, it's gotten quite popular so the wait slowly gets longer and the service lags every few times I go because a few people on staff call out last minute and they're understaffed (I always find myself chatting up our servers there so I get the scoop). The entrees are delicious. I've just about everything on the menu. The drinks can range from being watered down to so strong that you only need one... but the mimosa pitcher never stops pouring so it's well worth the $$. Make sure your whole party is there when your table is ready or else they won't seat you!

Service was ridiculously slow even though the bar was pretty much empty and not even half the restaurant was full. It took over 10 minutes for someone to even approach us to take our drink orders once we were seated.Food was really ok, nothing great. The only thing I had that was exceptional was the scallop appetizer. They were out of a bunch of things on their menu. I was told this was due to Sunday brunch. Why stay open for dinner then? I guess they're just serving whatever is left over. The only thing that remains great are the drinks and happy hour. Which is all I'll be going back here for. 2008 review:Planned a small birthday dinner here for a friend and couldn't be more pleased with everything about this place. First off - the drinks. Mango mojitos were awesome and the sangria (had the red) was absolutely the best I've had. Which finally knocks Tapeo, Boston's off the top of my list after 10 years! Watermelon martini was strong, but too sweet for me.Food - Very fresh mussels, calamari with the most unusual dip: avacado with habanero. Potato pancakes were to die for. My favorite was definitely the one with sauteed onions and apple sauce. For entrees, i shared the sea bass and the lamb chops, both of which were good, but i could have kept ordering appetizers instead. Had the apple tart for dessert. Deelish.I have to say, the service really completed our evening. Our waitress was so attentive and very patient (what with 9 women who couldn't stop chatting long enough to order!). We were never left waiting for anything for any period of time. We were ordering sangrias by the glass when our waitress stopped us and suggested a pitcher so it would work out a lot better for us. We would have racked up a ridiculous bill instead! I seriously haven't had such great service for a while. Best of all, at the end of the night, the price was right.

I used to think it was an over-hyped trying-too-hard-to-be trendy yuppie hangout but a few months into neighboring with this popular hotspot, I changed my opinion.Dinners are good, although weekdays are quiet. Their Lobster Night isn't a bad deal. The lobster was cooked nice and tender and came with two sides. For only $16, I couldn't really complain. I've gone on all-you-can-eat mussel nights and they really do stay true to their word and continue to bring you little metal pot after pot of juicy mussels with flavorful broth. The quality was okay but the broth made up for it. The stuffed chicken was pretty good as well, as is their sangria and all appetizers (I think they have happy hour half-off drinks from 7-10 pm).The best part about this place is their brunch. I think Sundays are overrated because you have to reserve a week in advance and still have to wait for a half hour to two hours at times. Saturdays are quieter and although the food and deals are the same, it just doesn't say NYC Sunday Brunch.They have a $16 brunch which includes 3 drinks (the waitresses are clearly well-trained on the term ""fill to the brim"",  not to mention no one's counting anyways) and the entree of your choice (some have a supplemental fee). Try their classic breakfast with roasted potatoes, spring mix, eggs your choice, and delicious sweet and savory chicken apple sausages. The Salmon egg benedict is perfection (just enough texture explosion of smoked salmon, creamy hollandaise and soft poached egg), but I was not impressed with the Lobster egg benedict which was a bit on the dry side and no true outstanding flavor (and not enough meat to give you that bang for your buck, you know?) .Mimosas/Bloody Marys are average, but really, who is complaining about alcohol with brunch?

5.0,7/5/2008,"reservations, shmeservations. while i often forget to make a rez for brunch here, it is highly encouraged as many of the starving, hungover masses who gather in the hallowed entryway of essex are turned away for not having the foresight to call ahead. however, you can have reservations and STILL wait for more than 30 minutes to be sat. but just wait it out. brunch here is well worth your time. shuffle your feet, gossip with your friends, and wait for it. wait for what? many many many drinks. they say 3 come with your food-$16 for the whole shebang. but really, your friendly waitperson will just keep refilling and refilling your glass-so whether youre swilling bloody marys, mimosas or screwdrivers, be prepared to have many. the food is also really tremendous. not overly fussy, everything is quickly and expertly prepared. when i didnt eat the meatz i would always get the tempeh bacon which was the best fake bacon i've ever had. these days, i'm partial to the chicken apple sausage which is enough to rouse me from bed on my most hungover of days. sitting upstairs at essex and having a languid, leisurely and boozy brunch is one of my most favorite things about living in new york. i'll see you on the line.",2,1,3,Amy S.,"Brooklyn, NY",263,311,270

2.0,6/15/2008,"I've gotta say, with all the good reviews this place got I wasn't all that impressed and here's why:The Good:1. Cocktails: Watermelon martini - so tasty with real watermelon chunks!  Strawberry Mojito - not the typical mojito with some kind of carbonation going on in there, but it was really good2. Decor: interesting set up with a balcony seating in the front and back of the restaurant.  AND tennis balls on the wall!The BAD & UGLY (Yes, they get grouped together)1. We got our drinks menus first, which isn't a bad thing, but the reason they didn't give us the food menu at the same time is because they ran out!  And we had to wait a good 20 minutes before getting out menus.  They had several large parties that night, but how do you run out of food menus before drink menus!!  2. Service was sloooooowwwwwww.  Usually you just have to make eye contact with them or give them the little nod and you've got their attention, right? Umm....I guess this waitress just thought you were hitting on her because we literally had to wave our hand in the air to get her attention...several times.  Towards the end when we were paying for our bill, we just brought our bill to her because our arms got enough of a work out.  3. Food: the food wasn't necessarily bad, but I wasn't all that impressed.  Sweet potato fries - oily and flimsy.  I like mine with more crunch to it. Crab cake - bit more bread crumby than I would like altho it def had some good chunk of crab in therepotato pancakes with salmon and caviar - their ""signature dish"" and it was actually a decent dish.  goat cheese stuffed chicken - ehhh...not impressedI don't think I'd come back for another meal, but my friend said they have a great deal on Tuesday (I think) with $5 martinis (try the watermelon!) and unlimited mussels and fries.  That would prob be the only reason I'd come back here again.",1,1,1,Denise C.,"Boston, MA",18,135,9

I am (un?)fortunately one of the latter. This place is one of my favorites. The first time I went in, you had to squeeze through all the population of the lower east side to give your name to a hostess who looks either hungover or drunk herself- whatever, respect. I did not have to wait long, because my friends had already waited the prerequisite 2 hour wait. Prince and Michael Jackson's great hits were blasting, while I sat down and was served booze immediately.  If you go, make friends with the mohawked mimosa server named Rez. He will make sure that you in no way thirsty (nor sober). If he is tired, he will literally set down a pitcher of mimosa for you to ravage on your own.

4.0,5/7/2008,"Even though I frequent Essex, I didn't realize what a loud, LES scene this place was until I brought my mother when she was in town. It's kind of like how you don't realize how truly offensive certain rap lyrics are (I don't give a f*ck if this chick was my own mother, I'd still f*ck her with no rubber and c*m inside her and have a son and a new brother at the same time, and just say that it ain't mine) until the song comes on in the car, and you hear Mom gasp. Still, a good time was had by all.This is a brunch where you can get drunk without much difficulty.  You're most likely going to be standing at the crowded bar for anywhere from 20 minutes up to 2 hours waiting for a table.  And although only 3 Bloody Marys or Mimosas are included with your brunch meal, no one's counting.  Downside: the Marys are pretty watery and not that great.*  My primary reason for going to this place, as opposed to a couple better options in the neighborhood, is the cheeseburger. It's GOOD. Juicy, Worchestershire flavor, and more often than not it's a perfect medium rare. Get the egg on top. Live a little.Warning: if you order off the brunch menu, you are paying for those 3 Marys/Mimosas, regardless of whether or not you want them. Mom didn't.__________*I have to disagree with the people that loved the Bloody Mary here. Since moving back to NYC from NOLA, I've found good Bloodys hard to come by (and no one has the spicy beans).  However, Yuca Bar makes a tasty one, and the Crustacean Mary at Alias is what's good.",23,32,19,Peter D.,"Brooklyn, NY",4675,3021,10459

The perfect amount of time to enjoy my first Mimosa of the day.After being seated, I realized that maybe I shouldn't have had that mimosa because the $16 brunch menu comes with 3 refills of either a Bloody Mary, Mimosa or some other drink I can't remember now. I only remember these two because I had the Mimosa's while my date had the Bloody Mary's. I used my quota and left very happy. Probably another reason why they get 4 instead of 3 stars.The portions were perfect, if not as large as you would get at a diner.

Today I had 3 poached eggs over coarse-grained potato hash topped with pulled corned beef brisket. D-A-M-N good... Then I popped a few Lipitor to counteract the cholesterol. Other top picks: The Aristocrat (potato pancake topped with house-cured salmon gravlax, poached eggs & salmon caviar) and the Deep South (chicken fried steak, gravy, eggs any style, heart attack). The wait, even with a reservation, can be a bit long for some, but $3 drinks at the bar ease the pain. Usually quite the scene with a few B/C-list cameos here and there.

They are perfectly fried, aren't rubbery, and come with a delish avacado dip (which surprisingly pairs nicely with the calamari). I then ordered a beet + goat cheese salad (yum) and the mash potatoes (yum) for my main dish. The second time I came here I ordered Steamed Mussels...should have stuck to the mash potatoes. The mussels were extremely sandy, fishy, and the texture was mushy. I'm usually a huge fan of mussels but it is safe to say that I will never order them here again. For dessert lovers - selection is very minimal and nothing exciting. The atmosphere here is great....good for dates, girls' night out, and big group dinners.

Although my first white wine was a little warm, the waittress ensured the second was perfectly chilled. It was decently busy, but our server did her best to take care of things. The bus boys were good about getting dishes cleared (especially as we stacked up the shells).

Then takes the ketchup (that we reclaimed) off our table so she can refill it, again, no questions asked. I was just kind of annoyed at this time. Two minutes later, how are you doing? then takes salt and pepper. COME ON! Just ask and we'll say ok. One more half assed drink refill and a check. Working sundays has to blow. Working sunday brunches when all customers get at least 3 drinks b/c they are free, blows more. Being a beeatch about it and therefore only getting the requist tip amount, blows the most. She blows but the place itself is fun for a drinkfest brunch if you don't mind waiting in lines that last hours.",0,1,2,Meg P.,"New York, NY",29,176,0

4.0,2/23/2008,"clear your day when you have plans for brunch at essex.  sundays are fun days with this amazing $15 brunch complete with three cocktails that are almost never just three.  the servers are attentive to your table and like to keep all glasses filled to the brim.  the complimentary bread that tastes like an everything bagel is the perfect beginning to your meal.  my highest recommendation is for the mexican matzo brei, a wonderful twist on huevos rancheros with tortilla chips and cheese mixed in with eggs and black beans.  best when visited with a big group of friends, but depending on the time you go beware of the wait.  try to make a reservation a few days in advance.  the space is artistic and hip with high ceilings and good natural light.  the music never makes any sense, but the patrons hardly notice.  they are too  busy laughing, drinking, and wondering why they didn't listen to me when i said to clear their day.",1,1,1,sarah m.,"Brooklyn, NY",8,15,0

We had a spacious roundish table that allowed all of us to see each other and have 1 conversation. I hate long tables where you can't even see the people sitting on the same side as you.I started off with the lobster spring roll. It was delicious. Lots of fresh lobster meat and salad wrapped in rice paper. For my entree I had the mussels and frites. It was huge! Tons of mussels cooked in tomato wine broth and crispy fries.Dessert was heavenly. We ordered 3 desserts and the 5 of us devoured it in like 5 minutes. It was so much fun. We shared the banana foster, black and white cake, and apple pie crisp.

We queued.  And we watched the staff eat...in front of us.  They weren't hurrying.  I've worked in the food and beverage industry and I know what it's like to be working on an empty stomach, so I think it's a good idea that they eat breakfast beforehand.  But if the restaurant opens at 11am, it opens at 11am, or five past 11, after they've eaten.  Everyone shouldn't have to wait 15 minutes to watch them eat.  I thought it was rude.  Oh, and not everyone got to eat.  That guy cleaning the tables upstairs, and that one downstairs? Yeah.  Familiar scene.The food itself was decent.  The 3 drinks are a waste on me, although you can substitute any for a glass of orange concentrate or plain black coffee.  They don't serve any other coffee bevs.  I guess it speeds up orders.  Oh, no alcohol served before noon.  Not that I mind.The room itself is nice with two split levels and a lot of natural light.  This I like.",1,0,1,Domu A.,"Singapore, Singapore",13,46,40

I had a great time at dinner here last night with my girls from San Francisco (including a fellow Yelper Denise). They were all visiting for one reason or another and it was like old times back in the Bay Area. We laughed, we talked, we ate and then ate some more. It was a great restaurant to do some catching up. The restaurant wasn't too loud but it was still lively and our waitress was attentive and fun. The dinner entrees were pretty good but the appetizers/starters were probably better. But hello, let's not forget most importantly, half priced drinks from 6-9pm. And their $1 oysters all night! My Spicy Chipotle Pork Loin was pretty good and the dozen Blue Point Oysters were yum yum. My friend's Cuban Sandwich was delicious, too!

Catfish? who knows....everything that it was served with was pretty overpowering) that I ordered was in this too-salty creamy sauce that was not sufficiently described in the menu--there was no indication that there was a cream sauce involved...and it was just....not that great. Maybe I should have stuck with my original choice that the waitress warned me was very spicy. Admittedly, the appetizers i shared before this dish--the tilapia ceviche and especially the scallops with watermelon  were really tasty. I will give this much hyped spot credit for dealing pretty well (none of the attitude that I was expecting) with the fact that the pretty large party that i was a part of wasn't actually ready to sit down until nearly an hour after our reservation time (yeah, well, that's b/c they won't seat you until everyone's there!) and I did very happily indulge in a $5 (half price) blood orange mojito while i waited for the late comers, along with those too-tasty homemade potato chips at the bar.

It was a deal, but the 1/2 an ear of corn is a BAD idea out of season.  And, of course, if you drink you spend at least $40 on the signature cocktails.    Then I started going for dinner. I was still pretty poor so a friend and I would get the goat cheese salad (yum yum! warm little browned pucks or goat cheese!) with beets, one appetizer(something different every time), and and entree to split (usually the chicken).  Always good, all of it, though I adore the short rib appetizer with spicy hush puppies. Once I got the sheep's milk cheese salad instead of the beet/goat combo and I was having salad envy all night of my friend across the table. But then he envied me when I got the cheeseburger empanadas.  And rightly so. I thought they could have been cheesier, but were pretty yummy and the sauce was like a home-made version of ""special sauce"".     Finally I managed to get to a brunch for the first time ever in living in NYC for over 5 years (I work weekends) and I ordered the ""Southern"" somehow my table's orders got messed up and we got a huge apology and got to drink as much as we wanted during our wait. I was tanked when the food FINALLY came and tore into it like I hadn't eaten in YEARS.    First time I have eaten edible biscuits-n-gravy in NYC. Kiss my backside old devil moon!  The portion was not of gargantuan southern proportions, but was exactly enough that I felt satisfied and not miserable.

First off, let me say, my compliments to the DJ, or whoever put together the playlist.  Great music!  Just turn it down a little.  I couldn't even hear my Scottish Conqueror, and he was right in front of me.  Kudos for the $4 Midori sours.  I actually didn't mind the teeny glasses.  And kudos for having that HOTT bartender.  Muaac!My reservation was at 2:15.  A couple of us were late, and the hostess of course would not seat us until our party was complete.  Translation: This establishment is full of shit.  Or maybe just the hostess.  Since one of us had texted to say she was running way late, I changed the reso to three.  She said to come back in when the third arrived, so we did just that.  When I said the fourth would meet us there later, the hostess was quick to say ""Well, she won't be able to sit down or eat anything"", which I thought rude and stupid because there was room for her.  At least when our friend arrived, we were able to get her a chair, and the waitress gave her a mimosa for free, which was way nice of her.  But what kind of shit was that for the hostess to say?  Anyway, she told us to have a seat at the bar and she would seat us in TWO MINUTES, which turned into about 20.  Add another 10 to get our order taken.  Add yet another 20 to get our food.  So 50 minutes of pure waiting around.  Of course, I thought the food was going to be special.  Nope.  I ordered the Southern, scrambled eggs, sausage patty and biscuit with gravy.  It was good, but my mistake to have ordered something southern in New York.  I should have known better.  They did keep the mimosas coming, which was great, of course, but we wanted to try one of each drink.  Nope, it didn't work that way.  Check out the looks on my friends' faces in the local photos.  That says it all.  Anyone who says they like brunch here must just like the drinks, and I'm with you on that.  But you can't honestly like the food here, or at least think it is a stand out.  FYI: Not that good.  The drinks are definitely its strength.The waitress was not bad, but didn't really go out of her way either.  When we were finally seated, they brought us the bread, but no plates for the bread.  The Scottish Conqueror did not have a knife.  The waitress brought plates, but one had egg and parsley on it, so she brought another, dropped that, and then brought another.  Just not her day, but we tipped her fairly well anyway.  They did keep the mimosas coming, but the water came in those same teeny glasses, and they didn't keep that coming.I think we all left with headaches.I'm glad you others had a great time there, but maybe we didn't have the ""big spender"" looks on our faces, we were not a big group, or something.  I don't know.  But I do know that next time I come to this area to eat, I'll just go have a kimchi hot dog around the corner and polish that off with a Sugar Sweet cupcake or two.2.5 stars, rounded.",8,7,5,Maria M.,"New York, NY",245,509,53

4.0,6/25/2007,"Ah, brunch, how I love it. I rarely end up going, for some reason, so when I do I like it to be good, with a side of laidback. We were seated quickly for having seven people, which was nice. The price is reasonable and my standard three-egg breakfast was good. I like fairly straightforward breakfast food when I go out, because I like it and I rarely cook it for myself. My eggs were a little weird but not bad-tasting (I'm not a fan of clumping them all together in a giant egg with three yolks. Just a personal preference.) The bacon was good and the potatoes were okay. Some of the more complicated meals that my tablemates were having didn't look so great, to tell the truth, but could just be because of my preference for a basic breakfast. One friend had some potato pancakes that were way too big and a little over-fried for my taste, and I think hers too, given the look on her face. The Southern breakfast next to me just looked like gravy central, but I guess that's the point. I think someone else got the Mexican and liked it, and my other friend had a steak salad that she cleaned up. The green salad on the side of my eggs was a nice touch, and the dressing was good. So overall I'd give the food three stars, as no one was completely disappointed. Service was low-key and attentive, and there was the reputed ""topping off of drinks"" for no extra charge. The original versions of the Bloodys were quite watery - definitely nothing extravagant, and I love them so that I'd almost rather pay for a good one when I get to go out to brunch. But it's all the name of the game at Essex, and the Mimosas were good, so that made up for it (I switched after one Bloody Mary.) The space is really bright and pretty, and busy in a comfortable sort of way.

Then for dinner I had the baby lampchops, which were cooked so they were crispy along the outside and tender in the middler - this was with 2 chorizo dumplings which added a really interesting flair to the mildness of the chops.They have a nice dessert selection too - for those of you who want to includge - a peanutbutter sigh pie, which I'm told makes you sigh!  And for the Uber-diva LESer like me - a small Black and White Cake - which is similar to the cookie - but bigger, and really, really MOIST!  Highly recommend for the cool vibes, fun eye candy - big dinner groups or romantic tete-a-tetes!!!",1,0,1,Rachel B from LES B.,"NY, NY",747,127,20

(And that last one doesn't even SOUND like a good idea. I digress.) Same with Cucumber Vodka saketinis and Pomegranate Martinis. SOUNDS like a good idea. Not really great in reality. But honestly, this is the case with many drinks around the city, and those places don't have a 3 hour $5 happy hour drinks with $1 oysters on Thursday. Okay, the oysters were a bit gritty, but they were good nonetheless. The service was friendly, though a bit overwhelmed. And the decor is suprisingly open and airy for a LES establishment. And though I didn't love those two drinks, some of the others were more promising.

We had a great chipper waitress on the upstairs side above the restrooms though I can't remember her name at the moment.

I've also tried the gnocchi app (decently good but nothing that exciting) and the potato pancakes (again, all right, but not so good I'd order it again)... the vibe here is fun, and I love the decor, so that bumps it up from 3 to 4 stars... oh, and the dollar oysters!",1,0,0,Yee C.,"New York, NY",38,124,0

2.0,10/28/2006,"two things about this place annoy me.1. they start brunch at 11:30 and boast how they include 3 drinks. but then they won't/can't serve you until noon, which is really awkward if you get there right at 11:30. perhaps this is only a problem for me, since it seems like people in nyc generally like to eat their meals a solid 2-3 hours after everybody else.2. they're only cash only at brunch? WTF? we got there at 11:30 and got our food. the potato pancakes were ridiculously awful. potato pancakes are supposed to be potato patties filled with oniony deliciousness. this was frozen home fry grated pieces, formed into a kind of ball and deep fried beyond recognition, so any attempt to stick my fork in it to eat it would result in shards going across the room. it was coupled with like a spoonful of black beans. i was expecting a lot of food so i was seriously disappointed. and then we had to wait until noon to order our drinks, and our waiter was totally trying to push us to leave because it got super crowded. and then we got our drinks and they were really watered down! so despite hoping to leave this place full and buzzed, i left it still hungry and with no buzz to speak of despite downing 3 mimosas in less than 5 minutes. judging from the other rave reviews, maybe i just had a bad experience. i'll definitely consider trying it again, and hopefully i won't be disappointed again.",3,3,0,Laura A.,"Philadelphia, PA",95,703,42

There wasn't enough broth and I was bummed because my friend loves to soak it all up with the bread and I didn't want to short change her experience. So... I sacrificed my share of broth and ate the majority of the mussels instead. The dish satisfied the craving though... it wasn't that fabulous. We had a potato cake with goat cheese and that was very tasty.We made the mistake of ordering a potato napoleon though and didn't care for it. The spinich in the dish was garlicky good, and the potato pancakes they used for the napoleon were good too... but... no, I wouldn't order it again.Our waiter was new but he was pleasant and accomodated my pregnant woman request for watermelon from the bar.

Can't say much about the drinks here because I wasn't drinking, but my friend tossed down about a half dozen blood orange mojitos - made of fruit so real that he found orange seeds in his drink.Service was adequate, and the decor is industrual-like with exposed pipes and high ceilings. It's unlike many LES restaurants because it's not tiny - you won't have to worry about bumping elbows with the people at the next table.

Possibly the best calamari I've ever had! The Jewish and Latin twist on their dishes makes for many a yummy treat! Towards the end of dinner the music became even hotter and crowds started rolling in to just enjoy the bar.

We exhaustingly waited for over an hour and a half for a table, but their $4 mimosas, bloody mary's, and screwdrivers held us over for 45 mins of our wait.  They have a great brunch selection, and surprisingly though it was crazy busy--service was great, attentive, and fast!  The crowd is fashionable and fabulous--and apparently this is the place to be for brunch.  Even groups of guys take up spaces at the bar to enjoy downing screwdrivers for hours at a time.  It's the perfect Sunday substitute for football off-season!  I'd recommend definitely attempting to get a reservation for brunch but still bring comfy shoes and patience!",7,0,4,Gabby D.,"New York, NY",220,303,131

4.0,11/14/2005,"Jewish and Latin food. Great for Sunday brunch. This is the lower east side, and as brunch is a staple on the weekend agenda, it gets crowded. But have no fear..there is actually a Sunday brunch bar scene here. I kid you not. Sure, people have traded in their Foster's and Martinis for Bellinis, Mimosas and Bloody Marys', but it's a 'scene' nonetheless. The hostesses are a bit disgruntled, and often confused, as I've found. They can't quite get the table availability right for the 2 upstairs sections. But the food is quite good, once you get seated and sorted. I love that the Matzoh Brie, which is a traditional Passover breakfast dish made with crumbled matzoh, egg and milk and sort of fried like a fritatta, is almost sacreligious in its accoutremant of chicken apple sausage. It feels naughty. They also have a Wednesday night Lobster special for $14, with each addt'l lobster only $8. I have yet to try this, but I hear it's pretty decent.Let's review....Jewish/Latin fare that comes with quite a 'social scene on the Lower East Side. Sunday brunch is literally a party thrown by a famous DJ.' As a famous NY columnist often says, 'Only in New York, kids...only in New York.'",1,1,1,Sarah O.,"Cary, NC",79,147,4
