3.0,5/2/2019,"Good Greek spot, came here during lunch on a Monday and appreciated how quiet the place was. Close to Times Square but not in the center of the chaos. Everything was good but nothing really popped. Love the ambience and the fancy decor. Would come back and try the fish next time. We got the 3 spreads- hummus, the caviar one, and eggplant. All 3 was amazing but loved the caviar one the most - it's a bit of an acquired taste. The plates were really small for the price. The flamed cheese was meh but put on a little show. Meatballs were under seasoned. I liked the chopped octopus salad, we shared it among 3 people as a side.",0,0,0,Florence V.,"Dyker Heights, NY",116,73,295

Fried Haloumi was tasty and flambéed with ouzo for extra drama. My free range chicken was juicy and perfectly cooked accompanied by lemon potatoes.

3.0,2/13/2019,"My fiancé and I ate dinner here a few nights ago before going to a show at Carnegie. We arrived a few minutes late for our reservation and they seated us right away. They brought us menus and water. Some bread and tahini. All good things. Then we ordered their highlighted wine, which was good. However, the woman who brought it to the table struggled to open the bottle and made a mess of the cork. When she poured the taste there was a piece of cork in it that I pointed out. She seemed offended and even more offended when I aske her to decant the wine. And, was rude about the whole thing. The food was good. We had the haloumi for appetizer, then chicken and seafood pilaf for dinner. All tasted good. But, we felt very rushed and like it was a catering hall, where different people run past your table dropping food, picking up plates, filling up water and wine glasses. That's another point of contention I have they poured the wine glasses so full that it was inappropriately full, almost 3/4 full, like a catering hall with no class would do. I gave 3 stars because the food was good, but the service is seriously lacking, no one was polite, no one spoke other than to take our order and just made us feel rushed. Not my idea of a nice dinner.",1,0,0,Sunita S.,"New York, NY",92,140,39
4.0,2/10/2019,"We had a 630pm Thursday reservation and were seated promptly. This is a great Greek restaurant that I have been to many times. This time I was with a business colleague and friend. My friend is from Bermuda and he asked for a meal that he can't get there. I chose the restaurant. Ambiance is mid town New York, high - endy restaurant.We each started with the grilled octopus which was wonderful. Deliciously seasoned and a good portion. Sometimes you order this dish in other places and get one small, dry octopus - not here. These were plump and tender, crispy on the edges. How come I can't make it this way at home?  I have tried.Mains were moussaka and lamb chops. My moussaka was great. Don't let the modest size serving dish fool you there is plenty of lamb and other good stuff in there. My friend got the lamb chops which he loved. I could tell he liked them as the rib bones were gleaming when he was done. We ordered a Macedonian cabernet. It complimented the lamb dishes perfectly.  The Greek wine list always amazes me when I come here. They have the best selection of indigenous Greek wines I have ever seen, in or outside the US.Service was professional, pleasant, helpful and authentic.We then got a small cheese dish which went very well at that point of the meal. We were dining not rushing as we had not seen each other for quite a few years and were enjoying catching up.We finished up with a Greek port-like drink, recommended by our server.

4.0,1/13/2019,"Came here with a group of 5 people and had no issue getting seated. They are also listed on opentable so you can double dip rewards if you know how. The place has tons of seating. Definitely a well established restaurant. I only tried the braised beef short ribs. Meat was extremely tender. No bone. Sauce was excellent. The polenta was decent, still felt a little grainy. I think the portion size was slightly on the smaller side. A little bigger piece and it would be perfect. The restaurant is pricey but rightfully so. The service was okay. They were professional about it or at least tried to make it appear that way but the body language and tone was a little off putting. Yes we appeared to look like we're a younger group but still didn't feel a homey environment.I think the dish I had was solid so I'll probably come back here to try other things.",0,0,0,Leo O.,"Queens, NY",200,518,1703

Being in midtown, this place is overpriced. My dishes were okay, and honestly the service was crappy. The people were generally unfriendly and when you're paying that much, you really expect the experience to be on par.

The portions were TINY.  Sometimes that's ok if the taste is exceptional, but that wasnt the case. The appetizers were tiny. We ordered an appetizer and 2 entrees. One of the entrees was a salad. It literally had a few leaves of arugula and 4 very small pieces of butternut squash for $18. Absolutely ridiculous. We travel the world and have eaten at Michelin star restaurants. This was unacceptable. The fish was ok at best as far as flavor and again for $29 it was a tiny portion with 1 beet cut up. There's a wealth of restaurants in NYC.

We came on her recommendation since she had been here before. We sat at around 4:30 and ordered drinks but waited to order food until the dinner menu was available at 5:00. The warm bread and hummus that they brought to the table was delicious. We then started with the spanakopita. It was small but just enough to have an app before our food. It was crispy on the outside and perfectly seasoned on the inside. For my meal I ordered the cannelloni stuff with braised lamb and covered in a cheese sauce. It was fantastic! The lamb was tender a extremely flavorful and the cheese sauce complimented it perfectly and wasn't overpowering. I also had the Hydra Breeze (love St Germaine in a cocktail) and a Tito's Cosmo and both were made to perfection.

Food is not bad but not noteworthy at all,  truly nothing spectacular.  For the prices they charged, you'd be better off going to other Greek restaurants, and there are better and more reasonable ones. They got a huge list of wine though, all written down in a seemingly unending compilation. I wonder who has time to read thru the book, so good luck and oh, do bring a magnifier for that.  Unfortunately, our first-time dining experience at this place was made memorable only because of the company, not the food nor service.",0,0,0,Lily T.,"Manhattan, NY",1,39,0

4.0,12/9/2018,"A cold day in Manhattan is the perfect reason for escaping to Greece. Since I can't afford a ticket to Crete, I end up at Molyvos.My server recommended the octopus which I felt was a bit too adventurous for me.I ordered the moussaka which is real comfort food. I taste ground lamb, cinnamon, bechamel sauce, peppers, tomatoes, potatoes and Eggplant.    The potatoes are silky and melt in your mouth. There are roasted tomatoes on the bottom. It is deeply satisfying. The moussaka has been made with love.I ordered a terrific glass of red wine which cuts the richness of the dish. The wine list is interesting and populated with lesser known Greek wines. The portion is large and enough to feed two. The lunch menu seems pricy to me.At lunch there is an interesting crowd of older people, families with children and men flirting with the bartender.

5.0,11/25/2018,We came in from California for the Macy's Day Parade over Thanksgiving and made an advanced reservation at Molyvos. The reviews are inconsistent but we decided to give them a try. They did not disappoint. Service was on spot. The food was absolutely wonderful. We went with the prix fixe menu for Thanksgiving dinner with wine pairing. Everything was sooooo good! They are an upscale restaurant but some people did not dress for the occasion. We did. There is a lot of scaffolding around the city and it appears that there is a lot of restoration work going on. This did not distract from the ambiance inside. The photos people have posted are just like the interior of the restaurant. Spacious. You don't feel like you are sitting on top of each other.

They cook it with olive oil, garlic, oregano, bay leaves and I don't know what else magic but it's perfectly charred on the outside and tender all the way through and expertly seasoned.

It's one of those things you can't stop eating even if you wanted to stop. Next we ordered the Kumato tomato salad. It was so good my husband and I just started laughing because we couldn't believe the taste. It instantly brought a smile to our faces. A great way to start the meal. Finally our entrees. I'm not a huge seafood person, so I decided to go for the half roasted chicken. I didn't want anything to heavy that would put me into a food coma during the show. It was so good. The taste and moistness of the chicken was perfect. And let me say.. it was HUUGGE. I could not finish it. My husband opted for the grilled octopus just because that's his all time favorite food in the entire universe. He claimed it was not the best he had but it was definitely up there in terms of taste. The one comment he added is he would like it more crispy.. but that could just be a personal preference. The Greek wine was fruitful but dry. Perfect for my taste.

1.0,10/19/2018,"I love Greek food, but we had the most horrendous experience at this restaurant last night.  If I could have left zero stars, I would have.  I ordered the Lamb Souvlaki ($36), and my husband ordered the Moussaka ($32).  The prices are outrageous, but we figured this was par for the course for a gorgeous looking restaurant in Midtown Manhattan.  Nonetheless, we were expecting a nice portion at this price - but that was only the first disappointment.  2 tiny skewers of lamb on WOODEN skewers no less - sitting on a small portion of asparagus arrive.  I didn't want the rice, and opted for asparagus instead.  When I ordered the lamb, the waiter asked specifically how I would like it done - and I was very specific when I answered ""Medium"".  I even elaborated and said I wanted it pink inside.  Disappointed in the puny portion, I figured I'd start with the asparagus.  It was okay.  Then I cut into one of the 6 - 8 tiny pieces and it was hard to cut.  VERY tough.  I saw that it was well done, overcooked in fact.  I cut another piece open and sure enough - no pink.  I called the waiter over - and I APOLOGIZED - saying that I was very sorry - but I had ordered it to be pink inside and showed him that it was beyond well done.  He said no problem - I'll bring you another plate. Get this... He returns with ONE skewer with a few stalks of asparagus.  I said - excuse me but there were TWO before... what happened to the other skewer?  He look annoyed, and returned it yet again.  Now he brings out another plate - with 2 skewers of the smallest pieces of meat you could imagine.  Smaller than before.  I removed the meat from one skewer and to my horror, the pieces were RAW!  I called the waiter over again, and told him this was absolutely ridiculous.  HE DID NOT APOLOGIZE to me - but looked annoyed.  They were about to get me yet another plate when I said - forget it!  Just bring me an order of Moussaka that my husband ordered, and was already done eating.We waited a lot longer than it took to get his order... and my husband made a crack about them adding some unwanted ingredients to mine to make it extra special.  They finally bring it out, and honestly, it looked a lot different than my husband's had.  We both looked at each other and giggled nervously.  I tasted it... and it seemed okay.  The waiter came by and asked if it tasted good.  I said, yes it did - but it looked a lot different than the one my husband had.  He said (I swear) ""It IS different"".  I asked him how, but he didn't answer.  Now I was paranoid, but I finished it because I was famished.  It was just okay.  VERY greasy.  Definitely NOT worth $32.  Insane.  No one ever apologized.  No one offered a complimentary anything for going through this horrible experience.  Nothing.  Never again.  Be warned.",1,1,0,Nadine J.,"Matawan, NJ",53,9,0

Yogurt Samer:  three different flavor (one of the person in my party didn't think it was anything special compared to the Greek restaurant in Astoria) Chocolate Cake:  for the birthday girl (when I made the reservation ahead of time, I asked if they did anything for a birthday and I was told I could purchase a cake and they'll be happy to put a candle on it, which I appreciated!!!) Greek Coffee:  can asked to adjust the sugar (I'm not sure if it was good since I've never had Greek coffee but I'm not sure that I am a fan) Hot Tea:  came out in teapot, was cute!Our bill (with 2 glasses of wine and a mojito) came up to around $310 (20% tip).Service and food was good (but I wouldn't say it was out of this world).  It's a nice place to stop by if you're in the area for a show.  The waitress was attentative and asked if we were in because of a show and what time our show was (to make sure we had adequate time).  The hostess was also friendly and great!  We finished our meal, left at around 7:30 PM and was perfect to walk down to Carnegie for our show.",1,0,1,Wendy Y.,"Queens, NY",35,66,94
3.0,9/16/2018,"Went here after a Broadway show with high expectations of amazing fare but it was just average. I'm a huge fan of Mediterranean/Seafood but wife and I were not wowed by anything. Certainly delicious, but not nearly as fresh or tasty as our go two go-to places in NJ. We went at 5pm on a Sunday (dead in there) so got seated right away. I did like our server; we explained our allergies and things we can't have and she went out of her way to verify that what we ordered would be okay (thank you!). The meal starts with a basket of assorted breads. We ordered vegetables, saganaki, and spinach pies to start. The vegetables were cooked the way we wanted (all sauces on side) but way overpriced, the saganaki prepared normal (delicious!), and the spinach pies were a waste. Four small pieces to share, and its tastes and reminds me of the bulk pack you buy at Costco. There was nothing memorable there, and it wasn't steaming hot. For the main we ordered the Lavraki (which we typically order at any Greek/Mediterranean restaurant) but I didnt find it nearly as fresh or tasty as our local places (at double the price) with no sides. Also ordered the lobster special stuffed with crab and scallops. We enjoyed it but again not wowed. Its probably a 1 1/4lb lobster; they crack the claws and tails so you can easily take out the meat, and there is stuffing in the middle with breadcrumbs on top. I wish they did a better job of cleaning out the ""green"" stuff in the middle of the lobster before stuffing it.Ordered the lemon garlic potatoes and greens on the side. Greens were salty but tasty, and the potatoes were okay, but way down on my list of best places to buy lemon potatoes. They were mildly garlicky and lemony, but mushy.  At $24 we were very underwhelmed. Baklava is just one or two small bites, and very sweet. YMMV if you like that sweet but we dont. The places is very nice inside, but the food quality and preparation we experienced did not warrant the cost. Had high hopes for this place, but cannot recommend it. This is a restaurant that is part of the Livanos group, so if you are looking for a different upscale restaurant, I would recommend going to Ouisa (also in midtown on the west side) instead here.",0,0,2,Giovanni T.,"Pomona, NY",10,140,688

I ordered the octopus appetizer which was beyond lovely especially with its large size for an appetizer. I got there at at weird hour, in between lunch and dinner so the place was pretty empty. They have an extensive  wine list with different Greek wines to try by the glass or the bottle. If you're feeling adventurous and want to try something your palate may not be used to, try the Vidiano natural wine. Greek wines are a world different from what many are used to, and so delicious once you try different types and understand them. I'll definitely go back to this place again.

4.0,5/30/2018,"I avoid Midtown restaurants. Sure, maybe I'm missing out on a few must-sees here and there, but I'd much rather spend my time in another neighborhood. I also tend to find that pre-theater fare is far less exciting than what one might find on a dinner menu downtown. The food tends to be boring, with speed often being prioritized over precision/craft. Perhaps Molyvos is close enough to the gravitational pull of the Columbus Circle heavy hitters to get some of that magic. While it's definitely more fitting for a more buttoned-up crowd, there's still a lot of enjoyment to be had here. The menu is varied and the classics are well-executed. If you're into Greek/Mediterranean food and find yourself needing a pre-show or business dinner restaurant, Molyvos is a solid pick. My aunt arranged a lovely party for my grandfather's 90th birthday here on Monday night. After sipping some champagne we sat down to our table apps: and assortment of dips (hummus, taramosalata and tzatziki) as well as some spanikopita triangles. The dips were fresh and tasty, which appeared to be homemade. Passing the dips test is very important for a Greek restaurant, and quality was not sacrificed here. The restaurant itself is quite large, which is to be expected for a pre-theater venue. Refined but not uppity, certainly approachable for the type of folks who want a good nosh before their Carnegie Hall night. It's hard to speak for the service here, simple because our night was planned out beforehand, but from what I can tell, it's efficient and well-timed. Our wine glasses were refilled at a good pace but we were never given too much at a time, allowing the utmost enjoyment of our experience. Because I myself did not order the wines we drank on this particular night, I cannot speak to the types. They were pouring one red and one white, both of which I tried. I know very little about Greek wine and honestly don't even know if the wines they were pouring were Greek, but both were very tasty. They paired excellently with all of our courses.Food-wise, too many options to choose from at Molyvos. There's a sizable list of small plates AND appetizers, plus a bunch of entrees--all of which look mouth-watering. That tends to make my head spin, so luckily I didn't have to do much deliberating during this meal. We had a pre fix with options, so I got to try pretty much everything delivered. Other than entrees, the meal was served family-style. Our eats, below:Greek Village Salad (Kumato Tomatoes, Cucumbers, Peppers, Red Onions, Kalamata Olives, Lesvos Feta, Red Wine Vinaigrette): A-/AStraightforward but integrity was upheld. The only real complaint was the absurdly large, rectangular block of feta placed atop the salad. While I'm rarely one to complain about too much cheese, this was a bit excessive. I prefer things to be in proportion to one another. Feta is an integral part of a classic Greek salad but we had to take it upon ourselves to slice it like butter before consuming, and there was still too much. Otherwise, everything was yummy. Grilled Octopus w/ Marinated Chickpeas, Baby Artichokes, Tomato, Red Onions, Celery Leaves, Cretan Extra Virgin Olive Oil, Citrus Juice: A-The only reason I give this an A- and not an A is because I'm incredibly picky when it comes to octopus. It's probably my favorite food and I order it often. Pretty standard preparation, nice presentation (sorry, no pictures this go-round), solid flavors and decent execution. The octopus itself was well-cooked and well-seasoned and went very nicely with all of its accompaniments. Sea Bass with Mashed Potatoes, Peas: AOne of the lighter entrees on the menu, and very tasty. Another fairly simple preparation but that doesn't mean flavor needs to be sacrificed. The fish was cooked perfectly and had that wonderfully subtle sweetness that sea bass tends to have. I'm not a huge mashed potatoes fan but I liked these a lot. Not to heavy but still quite flavorful--very well done. Grilled Baby Lamb Chops w/ Creamy Wild Mushroom Potato Cake, Baby Greens, Ionian Garlic Sauce: ARich, hearty and delicious. I didn't try the potato cake, but the bf gave it two thumbs up. The meat itself was juicy and flavorful, and even the older folks abandoned their silverware at the ends, opting for hands-only to get the last little morsels of meat off the bone.",6,0,3,Molly T.,"New York, NY",887,464,1480

The salmon was too rare.  I Asked for medium rare but it was very rare & tasteless And it was sitting atop of an abundance of  beans.  Huge giant beans.  Lots of them & nothing else.  I didn't know it would be served with giant beans or I would not have ordered it. It totally overpowered the fish. I just don't think it is something I'd ever pair with Salmon.  The dessert of baklava was not fresh.    None of the food compared to my last visit.  The service was a bit slow too.,0,0,0,Kathleen C.,"Brick, NJ",12,14,2

3.0,2/6/2018,"Recently in New York, my partner and I were looking for something a little different. We happened to start thinking about Greek food, and found Molyvos on 7th Avenue.An attractive restaurant with a very full menu. We felt we'd stumbled into something interesting. And we weren't alone. We arrive for our 6:30 reservation (yes, early but we were leaving to return home early the next morning) and found a very busy restaurant, which, while we were seated, filled to capacity. Reservations (we had them) would be highly recommended.On to the food, we started with the hummus - Chick Peas, Sesame Tahini, Garlic, and Extra Virgin Olive Oil with fresh vegetables for dipping. Very tasty Hummus.Next, I had some lentil soup, a favorite of mine. Unfortunately, I can't recommend it. It was watery and flavorless. My partner enjoyed Mitilini Meatballs - lamb and beef, in a Tomato Red Wine Sauce. Unlike my soup they were most enjoyable.For our entrees my partner had a house specialty, Moussaka - spiced ground lamb and beef with potato, eggplant, pepper topped with a wonderful yogurt Bechamel sauce. It was great.I had the Grilled Black Sea Bass served over a creamy Rice Pilaf. The fish was cooked perfectly and had great flavor.One major draw back was the service. We waited quite a while between our appetizers and our entrees.

I also ordered the spanakopita and Greek fries. The spanakopita was light and flaky with a distinct hit of mint. The Greek fries were just ok. Limp but maybe they are supposed to be. Not sure. I expected them to come covered in fresh feta but they did not. Ladies room missing one sink knob and the first stall has no lock at all. Fantastic location on 7th between 55th & 56th.

One of my tests of a restaurant is how they treat a woman eating alone. I was treated like a queen. This time I tried the village salad.  Normally, I don't eat salads that contain feta because I find feta too salty.  I mentioned this to my server when she suggested it, but she assured me that the feta was from Samos and not very salty.   She was right: it was delicious. The simple dressing complemented the vegetables and cheese nicely: oil, vinegar and herbs - not thick and gluey.  And  the prawns were so good on Tuesday that I had to have them again.

I visited when I was staying at the Wellington Hotel, and stopped down for what I thought would be a late (930 pm), but nice and relaxing dinner. The waitress didn't know how to explain anything on the menu, and when I ordered two small plates as appetizers, I told the waitress I would likely order more and to leave the menu with me. She did, and then she never returned. Nor did any of the 5 or so employees who passed my table rushing around. And they weren't even busy (5 empty tables around me). The $15 cocktail was watery; the fava bean spread was bland; and the spanakopita tasted like it came out of a Trader Joe's box. I wish I could review more, but I wasn't able to try anything else. The waitress never came by to ask how anything was or if I wanted anything else. The only thing that was good about this evening was the Graviera cheese with thyme honey. Although I didn't taste any thyme, the cheese and the honey was good--hard to screw that up.

I wish the service could be the same. I had to call the waiter multiple times for water and our check, which took time and experience away. I was also not that keen on how our waiter rushed us with everything as if he wanted us to finish ASAP which I would totally understand if it was crowded... but it was far from that.

Anyhow, I was seated and presented with menu and wine list. Although I wanted to try a Greek wine, I opted for something else. I think the waiter called it ""house lemonade!"" It was great; it tasted like more like a tropical drink than lemonade but it was so good! The warm bread bowl that was brought out consisted of a mix of an herb-y (not sure of the type of grain) and mini pitas served with one of their signature Greek spreads. For entree, I had the pan seared sea bass and rock shrimp on a bed of creamy rice pilaf. It was fantastic!! There were a couple of people who came around and provided service. The chef (I believe he was) came out as well to ask how was everything. The dish really gave me so much taste and flavor to savour. The creamy pilaf was delicious and the fish seared perfectly.

This area is inundated with either high-end destination options, cheaper but v. noisy (and impossible to book) mom+pop options or outright Times Sq tourist traps...Molyvos is neither. The decor, food and service is quite upscale but the prices and menu are all within reach and grasp and the service was attentive and even impressive.The lamb chops were perfect as were all the appetizers we ordered.

Overpriced with small portion, entree did not come with any sides which we need to spend $20 bucks for 2 sides. The Brussels sprouts came in decent size but the wild green is sad looking swimming in the small bowl. My second disappointment is the $21 grilled octopus only came with 3 small heads with a few tentacles! A glass of house wine is $14! My grilled Sardines are not much to write about which made me miss the Sardines I had in Spain even more!

I had the Molyvos version of a sundae which was probably the best sundae I've ever had- amazing baclava flavoured ice-cream and fruit encased in filo pastry-excellent flavours... I forget the name of it but my daughter had a dessert with ice-cream , apple and spices- equally delicious. Finished off with a nice strong cappuccino and a Greek port.

I'm sorry I don't remember the male bartenders name, but he was very funny and charming. After our 4th ""just one more"" they said ""if you would like a dessert wine we would love to buy you one"". This place taught me to appreciate lamb, their sagonaki (sp?) was delicious. Brussels sprouts were perfect. Only thing I wasn't a fan of was the avgolemono soup.

The grilled salmon was cooked perfectly, the meat was tender while the skin was crispy. And dessert was, in my opinion, my favorite part of the meal. The lemon rice pudding did not taste heavy and the sour cherries truly made the dish.

It's such a long name for an dish. It's a warm appetizer wrapped in phyllo. I didn't really tasted the mint, which is fine because it's not empowering the taste of the vegetables. Summer Vegetable Sampling: grilled eggplant, zucchini and squash, roasted cauliflower, asparagus, spring onion, Molyvos hummus & red onion apricot compote, pita bread. The vegetables were nicely cooked, the zucchini melted in the mouth, the apricot compote added a nice touch to the hummus and the eggplants slices were delicious drenched in olive oil.Baklava: walnuts, pistachios, wrapped in phyllo, spiced honey syrup. This is one of those desserts that leaves me thinking ""Why did I ordered this? Now, my stomach feels so heavy that I'll never order dessert again."" because it so dense and sweet.

We were all very appreciative of how helpful they were in this process even though the people was not necessarily meant for 11. The spreads that we ordered as appetizers were all very delicious. The feta cheese was amazing - one of the best fetas I have ever had. My favorite was the eggplant spread and the hummus was great as well. I got the summer vegetable selection (don't remember the name of the dish exactly) for my main course and it was awesome. This was a spread of fresh grilled summer veggies with hummus and apricot compote on top. It was exactly what I was in the mood for because I had already eaten a lot earlier in the day and wanted something light. The reason why I'll give this place 3.5 stars is that the waiter recommended a dish to my mom that ended up being very heavy and cheesy (some traditional Greek dish that he insisted was the best in all of NYC) when she asked for something light as a suggestion.

Came here with a friend before the Stephanie Blythe recital on Friday evening.We caught an earlier train so when we walked early we knew we'd have the luxury of not having to rush. We took in the whole three course meal and both really enjoyed it. The pita and dip they bring to the table is quite tasty. I started with the crab cake and my friend started with the grilled octopus. Everything about the crab cake was delicious and I even finished all the sautéed veggies that came with it, which was pretty unlike me. The real star was the grilled octopus which my friend was nice enough to give me a taste of. I didn't believe all the other reviews, but this is like the best thing on their menu. It is a can't miss!For dinner my friend had the moussaka and I had the calamari pasta. I can't speak for her meal but I was a little disappointed by mine. The tomato sauce was a too tart and watery. Orecchiette was overcooked and thus did not stand up well to the sauce. The calamari was good though. That can go south fast being very rubbery but it was cooked perfectly.For dessert we split an enormous and delicious baklava. My after meal espresso was delicious and even had the wonderful crema! ALL the wines are from Greece and the Florina Rosé I ordered was perfect.

On the menu at $40 are soft-shell crabs which the waiter assured us just came in season  & are wonderful. Unfortunately they were mushy and tasteless. Just the other night at Shun Lee  we had soft-shell crabs that were exceptional There  is no reason for a Greek (specializing in fish) restaurant to be serving this type of food.

It was so strange that I only took a few bites. The pilaf seemed to be cooked in a thick sweet syrup. The mushrooms were completely overshadowed by the overpowering sweetness. I suppose it was the vinegar reduction, but it made the whole dish really unpleasant. My dessert was a semolina custard that the waiter suggested.

With a wonderfully modern decor, great service and excellent food, I would recommend Molyvos to anyone looking to satiate their craving for modern Greek in a sophisticated urban atmosphere. I took my wife and some friends (to celebrate their recent marriage) here for dinner for restaurant week and the experience was great. For the first course I had the Macedonian Meatballs - these just tasted like your classic Italian meatball in tomato sauce but were executed to perfection and quite tasty. For the second course I had the roasted chicken and I must say, while chicken usually suffers from being bland and tasteless, Molyvos did not disappoint. The portion was large, perfectly cooked and abundantly flavorful. The accompanying lemon potatoes were also well done and the perfect complement. My friend had the salmon souvlaki which I would also highly recommend. Cooked just right with highlights of charred flavor throughout, the salmon just melted in your mouth.

5.0,1/24/2015,"My husband and I were in the city for a weekend getaway. We decided to come back to Molyvos because we liked the restaurant from our last visit. Also, it reminded us of being in Greece from a recent vacation. When we walked through the front doors, we were greeted with 2 hostesses smiling and welcoming us to the restaurant. The atmosphere was very welcoming, comfortable and not overly bright with nice background music. We were seated by the window where we sat the last time we were here. It's a great spot to people watch. When we were looking at the menu, they brought out a spread to sample and a basket full of warm pita bread. We decided on some appetizers:We asked the waitress to choose 3 different type of cheeses that she thought we might like. A platter came out with Kasseri - Sheep's & Goat's milk cheese, medium-hard pale yellow cheese and sour cherries spoon sweet. Fresh Mizithra - Sheep & Cow's milk whey cheese, soft, sweet Mavrodaphne roasted sweet potato. Ladotyri - Sheep's milk cheese, olive oil cured hard salty cheese and Meyers lemon spoon sweet. All were very good and different from one another. I preferred the first and last cheeses. I didn't like the texture of the middle cheese, it reminded me of either cottage or ricotta cheese. Next we received the grilled octopus, which was very tender and delicious. It paired nicely with the arugula salad, blood orange and citrus vinaigrette. Lastly, we had the Greek Salad which had Kumato tomatoes, cucumbers, peppers, red onions, Kalamata olives, Lesvos feta and red wine vinaigrette. The portions for the appetizers were big enough that 2 people could share. We received our entrees, but we were getting full from the pita bread and appetizers. We ordered the stuffed red peppers: basmati rice, eggplant, zucchini, tomato and Manouri cheese. Also, we ordered the pan roasted stuffed pork chop: Hylopites, wild mushrooms, Kasseri and pistachios. We took a few bites of our delicious dinner and had them wrapped up to go. We were just so full from the appetizers, but we look forward to the left overs. We passed on dessert but it looked really good from the table next to ours. Our waitress was knowledgable, always available if we needed something and our water glasses were never empty. The prices are reasonable but if you enjoy a cocktail or two, it will increase your check quite a bit. I hope you enjoy your dining experience as much as we did!

5.0,12/13/2014,"Finding a good restaurant near Carnegie Hall is not difficult.  Yet selecting the right place for enjoying a delicious meal before curtain time can sometimes be daunting, especially during the holiday season.Molyvos, a Greek restaurant not far from Carnegie Hall fit the bill recently. The restaurant is a classy white tablecloth establishment which while authentically Greek, is decidedly not your typical Taverna.  On the recommendation of a fellow Yelp review, I choose the Chicken soup, Kotosoupa Avgolemono which is a melody of egg, lemon dill and chicken. The soup was amazing and savory.  My wife chose a roasted Butternut Squash soup.   For entrees, I stayed with a nice Moussaka while she had the Stuffed Red Peppers with a blend of Eggplant, Piperies Yemistes.  We each had a glass of Greek wine, may I say from those vineyards of distinction, not the usually avoided earthy reds.  Wines by the glass, from a small but specialized list, were presented in proper stemmed glassware.  The actual wine list is amazing and exclusively Greek selections.  Service was smooth, friendly and with good client interaction.  Given the ticking clock before the performance, we were going to skip dessert, but the Baklava which we noticed being served at another table, made the case for us.  Sumptuous and not the standard small honey drizzled pieces but really a lovely pastry presentation, which we shared.  Normally, I would have finished with a fine Cypriot Commandaria wine, but that's for next time.",0,0,0,John M.,"New York, NY",0,43,0

My husband and I have been there several times - with our kids, with his clients, by ourselves - and every time it's been really wonderful. First off, it doesn't bear a trace of blue checked tablecloths and paintings of yiayia; the interior is tasteful, New York, refined, but still has a touch of Greece. The drinks are good, and they have carefully put together an almost entirely Greek wine list - ask for recommendations. The grilled octopus is amazing, the greek salad is so fresh and good, the haloumi (fried cheese - just get it) is so so delicious. We've had a variety of fish for main courses, and they've all been prepared very well. And nothing finishes things off better than their baklava and masticha (a pine flavored after dinner drink.)

4.0,8/21/2014,"I've gone to Molyvos for years.  At some point it either changed hands or changed chefs and isn't quite as good.  On a recent visit, I was disappointed to find that my favorite dish, the stuffed cabbage, isn't on the menu for summer.  However, this did force my companion and I to try something new, the Saganaki.  It was flamed at the table and delicious, much less greasy than other Saganaki I've had.  Companion had the Greek ""cannelloni"" for main and only thought it was okay. I had the grilled octopus salad, which I thought was great, chopped nicely and well-flavored. I also had their lemonade, a favorite I always order.  Our server, as all the servers are at Molyvos was friendly and helpful.  However, the hostess, like all their hostesses was a major bitch.  I don't understand how a restaurant can routinely hires hostesses that are as nasty and depressing as they do.  Two criticisms, Molyvos is a real pain about seating before their official open time.  If you arrive 3 minutes before their official time, they won't seat you.  This is incredibly stupid, it creates congestion in their not huge entry area, it pisses you off, and there is no real reason not to do it as nothing is happening that close to tart time.  Second criticism, I considered ordering their Greek salad, which is great as a main course for lunch but they don't offer the option, as most other Greek restaurants do of putting fish or chicken or meat in it, to make it a real meal.  I also generally wish their lunch menu had more lunch-type offerings at a lower price, it this was an $86 lunch for too people, which is ridiculous.",0,0,0,Nicole R.,"Mountain Top, PA",44,16,0

2.0,3/26/2014,"Food is okay, but not remotely good enough to justify the prices or the crappy service. As usual with Manhattan, you're paying for the real estate and not for the food. The result is that they have to make a ton of $$$$ with every cover, and it shows. Service at Molyvos is that creepy combination of fawning and brusque that you always get at these corporate-account places: first they're smothering you, then trying to hustle you out. Waiters will invariably interrupt your conversation, often quite rudely, and then try to take your food away three or four times while you're still eating. They're also shameless about trying to rack up the bill: we ordered enough meze to feed a small Greek army, and the waiter sniffed about how we weren't ordering entrées. By the end of the meal you feel like you've beaten off a sleazy, supercilious panhandler. I can't even blame them: this is what Manhattan real estate prices turn people into. Food-wise, Diane Kochilas is a brilliant recipe consultant--her wild greens and winter squash pie is tender and complex, light and flaky, not-too-oily perfection. (The usual meze were the usual, no better or no worse than what you'd get at any decent Greek joint.) But if you want good Greek peasant food, with Kochilas's signature creative mixture of traditional and healthy, just go to Pylos.

4.0,3/2/2014,"Another New York City restaurant that caters to the over 50 crowd and looks at anyone younger with a certain skepticism [can they afford to pay the bill??] With that said, the food was absolutely delicious while the service could use some work.I had the ''caviar"" mousse [$8] which is served with pita and their house bread. Both were equally soft and tasty. The caviar mousse reminded me of lox spread in texture and in taste. It's kind of a big portion and with the bread, you can easily fill up on this spread alone. I also had the grilled baby lamb chops [$38] which came with potato, frisee, and a eggplant salad. There were 3 lamb chops, all were charred perfectly and seasoned so well. The meat fell off the bone and what didn't, I really wanted to gnaw at, but self restraint in a classy establishment.  Honestly, I could have done without the dessert. I had the baklava [$9]. The highlight of the dish was the phyllo dough and the honey syrup. Otherwise the filling was kind of clunky and bland. I've had better in mom and pop cafes. Regarding service, I came on a Friday night at around 7PM, I asked to the hostess if I could see at the bar and she looked at me as though this question has never been asked before. The bar was full but she told me I could sit at one of the seats right off to the side of the bar [where no one provides you with service or even knows you exist]. Finally someone got up and I took his space. I asked the bartender to recommend a wine that was semi sweet to which he replied in a pretentious manner, ""we have hardly any sweet wines."" He chose one for me which was still palatable and not overly expensive. He did lighten up through the rest of my meal which I appreciated.

5.0,2/24/2014,"Molyvos was a complete surprise to us. Not the ""it was better than we expected"" kind of surprise. We expected to be having dinner at my parents' house - in Atlanta. Georgia. Nowhere near 56th Street in Manhattan. After two cancelled flights because of fog at LaGuardia (a third world bus station located in New York City), we used Hotel Tonight (an awesome app) and found a cheap room at the Lexington Hotel (see my review on Yelp). We wandered around after checking in and stumbled onto Molyvos.They promised a twenty minute wait, and it was indeed twenty minutes. The hostess kindly let me plug my phone in to charge at the desk.We  were ushered to a nice two-top near the windows. It was a beautiful setting - a little more upscale than your typical Greek restaurant. There were no blue and white banners, although as in most Greek places only men took orders or carried food (that I saw). There WAS a display of the fresh fish available that night, and the fullest wine list I have ever seen in a greek restaurant. Most of the choices were from Greece. Knowing nothing about Greek wines, we put ourselves in the waiter's care. he asked a few questions (how full bodied, what price range) and we ended up with a fabulous bottle. Of course when we asked for him to decant it, he poured the entire bottle into the decanter - no filter, screen or any effort to keep sediment from going into the decanter. Still it was deliciious!We shared taramosalata (roe spread) which was a little creamier (and a little less fishy) than I like but it was delicious. We also had mizithra - something new to us. It is whipped fresh sheep's milk cheese, served with roasted garlic - yum - and oven dried tomatoes. Awesome. While we debated whether we should save half of the spreads to eat with bagels in the morning, we finished them.I had the grilled baby lamb chops - which were awesome. Perfectly done and  delicately spiced. They were served with potato cakes, frisee and delicious melitzanosalata - grilled eggplant salad. My wife had the grilled stuffed lavraki - Mediteranean sea bass wrapped in grape leaves. We both anticipated little dolmades filled with fish. Of course, when we were in Northern California years ago, we decided to stay in the Curly Redwood Lodge - made from the wood of a single curly redwood tree. We envisioned the Keebler Elves' tree house. We got a motel with lots of redwood panelling. The fish was whole - with the spine removed ( a few stray bones were a distration) - and delicious, resting atop the grape leaves in which it had been wrapped. It was stuffed with vegetable rice pilaf and had a nice Santorini white sauce.Dessert was an incredible apple and caramel phyllo creation with cinnamon ice cream for me - awesome. My wife had a warm semolina custard.

First the Chicken soup is the best I've ever had in my LIFE.  Fresh and lemonny, shredded chicken, light creamy broth, i think spinich, dill, cilantro, something like that, not sure on all the ingredients, but I know the flavor profile was PERFECT.  I wanted to LICK the bowl.  I had just a taste of the grilled octopus, tender, moist, meaty and delicious. Bread and spread, yummy too.Entree was the striped sea bass over a bowl of perfectly cooked mushrooms and stuff (again not sure what was in it, but every bite was DIVINE.  The fish was grilled and cooked perfectly. Both nights I sat at the bar, first night bartender service was terrible,  they took 15 minutes to even acknowledge my presence.  I would have had another drink and an after dinner drink had they ever even asked me if I wanted another one.  But they never did so I said forget it.Second night, Milan was working and he was so charming and delightful that he saved the 5 star rating that was going to be a 4 for the bad service the night before. Restaurants managers should realize the fine dining is about the total experience and should monitor staff to ensure consistency in  service levels to compliment their fine cuisine.

2.0,1/31/2014,The only thing that arrived quickly was the check.  What happened to Molyvos?  They used to be good.  Instead they seem to be cheaping out on their food.  The bread was just awful.  The mussels ok but just barely.   The wine by the glass is awful and overpriced.  Surely Greece has some decent wines?  I will not go back to Molyvos again. It just makes me sad.,2,1,0,Bonnie E.,"Manhattan, NY",451,82,0
5.0,1/21/2014,Molyvos has been a staple on the Greek food scene in NYC for more than 10 years and to me it is still one of the best meals in Manhattan. The restaurant is warm & inviting with top both service and food. Highlights for me include the octopus salad at lunch and at dinner the fried cod or the lahanodolmades. They are amazing! The wine list is 100% Greek and there are many excellent options to chose from. Molyvos is probably one of my favorite Greek restaurants in NYC and I hope it will also be yours.,2,0,2,Andrea E.,"Town of North Hempstead, Long Island, NY",0,11,5

5.0,1/15/2014,"This restaurant is stunning, with vaulted ceilings and lots of marble and granite.  The waiters wear these kind of patronizing little outfits, but whatever, I was totally into it.  They also seem to be actually Greek (or else good at faking it), which is helpful when navigating the wine menu which has tons of fabulous, unpronounceable Greek wines. To start, I had the beets on this creamy yogurt-like cheese.  The plating was beautiful and it was fresh and delicious.  I then decided enough with the healthy, light food and stepped up my game to the lamb shank in a clay pot with lentils for my main.  It was, hands down, the best lamb I've ever had.  I'm getting hungry right now writing about it.  The lamb basically fell off the bone into this complex, sort of smoky sauce.  Absurdly good.  For dessert, we shared the apple crisp, which was also very yummy (although the star of the show there was the candied apple on top of the cinnamon ice cream.)We waited a little while for our food as we were there during prime pre-show time, but the service was outstanding and they kept us updated on when our food would be arriving.  The prix fixe menu looked pretty serviceable and reasonable, also, so I would definitely come back to check that out.",4,1,0,Erin E.,"Boston, MA",335,264,9

We also got the omelette, same. There is a complimentary bread basket with the brunch, some coffee cake, cheese muffin and whole grain mini muffin. I didn't like any of them... The flavors didn't work well, I don't know, it may be made in the house but it tasted factory made ya know? Also, we had tea and coffee.... Not included with brunch, that kinda sucks. $5 for tea? It hurts a little. For brunch time, you really should have a hot drink included, how expensive is hot water?! Overall, service is great, food not so much, a tad bit expensive for what you get.

3.0,12/17/2013,"I am dying to go back to this very stylish, beautiful midtown Manhattan eatery, even though I only gave one star. I was fortunate enough to have drinks here on 11/20/2013 at their well-stocked, fashionable bar. However - I was unfortunate enough to be in direct earshot of the most obnoxious, loud political rant I've ever heard (at least while away from AM radio). It's especially unfortunate because this distracts from the cosmopolitan setting, Manhattan ambience and all the effort put into it over the years. To be clear, the blast of political rant came from - are you ready - not a drunk patron, but from the bartender. A strapping, ruddy young guy in his early 30s. You must know who you are, but does your manager? You couldn't possibly think you can actually stay in business and rant your rhetoric from behind the bar, do you?""Sara Palin didn't actually say 'I can see Russia from my house,"" he bellowed. ""You know that, don't you? It was Tina Fey from Saturday Night Live.""

The moussaka was homey enough but again, it wasn't amazing. The dessert was beautifully presented-- especially the Baklava. It was a bit cloying but very delicious. I had ordered the parfait which was equally sweet but addictive. It was basically just custard but the phyllo crisp was a good textural balance.

4.0,10/28/2013,"Great Greek cuisine with a wonderful dinner setting. I came by on a Thursday night with two of my lovely girlfriends and had a great time! Everything we ordered was cooked exceptionally well from beginning to end. We ordered the grill octopus for appetizer, which was cooked just perfect - flavorful and tender, and 2 tapas: meatballs and grilled shrimp. The tapas were served tapas style as small bites, which was nice to prevent us from over-indulging and ruining our appetites. Although the tapas were small in size, they definitely packed a punch as the flavors were bursting with so many different aromatic spices.For our mains, we ordered the Lamb Shank (so good!!) served with orzo, the Lamb Chop and the Moussaka (highly recommend if you're a fan of eggplant and potato!). We all licked our plates clean and were stuffed silly but couldn't resist getting a taste of their desserts. WOW! If you're a fan of almonds, the almond cake (Ravani) will be a sure hit. They also had a special that evening which was a hit in our group ... an apple tart served with ice cream (sounds so simple but as you take a bite, it will really blow you away!!) My friend also ordered the Phyllo Pocket which was served with a warm semolina custard - also quite good and not too sweet.Two thumbs up for an overall great Greek dining experience and an even better Girls Night Out!!",5,2,2,Diana P.,"Forest Hills, Queens, NY",51,263,1003

Both the calamari in sauce and the octopus were really nice apps (and they take the skin off the octopus thankfully). My moussaka was decadent and rich and all the fabulous things a moussaka should be, and my dinner-mates were also happy with their lamb/ bass choices. The pita just begs to be eaten. And the wine list. I got lost in there the minute I opened it. Like thousands of Greek wines. Who knew? The waiter gave us a really good recommendation in the $80 range.

For starters/small tapas, my lovelies and I, got :Meatballs - good amount of herbs and spicesGarlic shrimp - light and scrumptious, wasn't too heavy on the garlic and cooked very wellFor entree, I got the mousaka which is similar to a lasagna with eggplant, cheese and grounded lamb. It was alright. Both my besties got lamb related dishes and they all ate until nothing left on the plate (lamb shank and lamb chops). The dessert is a must! I tried their special of the night which was an apple strudel, topped with a cinnamon/vanilla ice cream and an apple crisp.

4.0,9/6/2013,"One of my most favourite Greek restaurants in the city! I think Molyvos had a makeover. I came here a year ago and recall the restaurant being on the casual/semi-loud end, I was surprised to see that the ambiance is now elegant and quiet (but definitely not sterile at all!). Here are some of the highlights of my meal:1) Bread Basket: Molyvos serves two choices - olive bread and pita slices with a roasted red pepper garlic drop. I love that both choices are fresh out of the oven!2) Greek meatballs: All I can say is that this dish is a pure taste of home. Meatballs are one of my go-to dishes at restaurants and Molyvos meatballs would be one of my top picks. 3) Garlic Shrimp: Our waitress highlighted this as a must-have and she was right. One of the best garlic shrimp dishes i've had! The shrimp was crunchy and just oozing with tomato/herb flavor. 4) I wish the portion sizes for the meatballs and shrimp were larger. It falls under ""MEZEDES"" so it lives up to its tapas portion. We received 4 little meatballs and 3 pieces of shrimp. I could definitely have eaten BOTH on my own. Must get more if you're sharing! 5) Grilled Octopus: Also another must-have recommendation on their menu. Note to yelpers that their octopus has a little more charred taste compared to other places, but the meat is very tender and the dressings bring out the flavor. 6) Our party of 3 shared the Claypot Lamb Shank, the Roasted Niman Ranch Pork Chop and the Grilled Fish Selection - All dishes were a hit. I would have thought that one dish would be less appealing,  but this was one of those meals where everything lived up to (or even surpassed) expectation. The lamb was cooked so thoroughly the meat was falling off the bone and the pork chop was incredibly juicy!Dessert for me was just average. Then again, I'm not normally a huge fan of Greek desserts because I find them too sweet. Our table shared the layered chocolate mousse cake and the molyvos sundae. Both combinations were unique, but not particularly memorable. All-in-all a very homey meal and a great place to bring the parents.

The stools are high, but comfortable. The chairs/table were comfortably laid out and it didn't feel cramped. The water glass was never empty (very important), and the server was nice and attentive. She did, however, forget to bring out the order of coffee, but she also didn't try to charge us for it, so maybe she completely forgot about it?The meatballs were very nice, fresh, not too compacted, and the tomato sauce it came out in was very well balanced. The spinach pie appetizer was good, but not that much different from a good frozen spanakopita. The baked eggplant was very hot, but was a good portion and quite filling.

As a vegetarian, the number of options were limited.  When asked by the hostess, she gave me only one option even though I could do other salads.  For Appetizer, there is a vegetable selection which comes with feta cheese.  Also, the Hummus dip is really good.  Lentil soup was average but did have a tinge of black pepper adding a kick to it.  The stuffed peppers is the only entree you can have -- lack of options did have me troubled but this dish is extremely well prepared and very appetizing.  Highly recommend it (not that you have an option if you are a vegetarian).",0,1,0,Ankan J.,"Manhattan, NY",145,181,404

2.0,3/22/2013,"We dropped by Molyvos tonight because it's the only restaurant that we were familiar with in the area. It is an upscale spot and we were not exactly in the mood for that. I think you would come to Molyvos for their fish, and I regret not having ordered a good plate of fish. Instead, I had free range chicken, which was good but nothing to brag about. The portion was very big and I could not finish it. Hubby ordered the moussaka not knowing what he was going to get. The dish was good but you better be hungry and ready for some HEAAAVY food. Not joking. A layer of cream or cheese on minced meat. The dish was smaller than my chicken but hubby walked out of the restaurant a bit woozy. Our friend got a plate of fish and the portion of it was just right and it looked quite good. As an appetizer we got a plate of hummus which I found too grainy for my taste and very bland. We also had grilled octopus legs, which was quite yummy but again, nothing to brag about. The experience was really a big ""Meh.""

2.0,3/22/2013,"I went to Molyvos years ago for the restaurant week lunch special and did not write review back then because first, I was not a Yelper, and second, I was neither impressed nor unimpressed, it was a decent food, but nothing special.  Yesterday, we were invited for a business lunch (thank goodness, I was not paying out of pocket) and now that I am on Yelp and still was not impressed, I felt like writing a review.  We shared appetizers-hummus, eggplant spread, tsatziki and spinach pie and while they tasted OK, there was nothing exceptional about them.  Put it this way-if someone were to line up this food against hole-in-the wall Greek/Turkish/Mediterranean place, I would not be able to tell the difference.  For the main course, I ordered the octopus salad, again, it was OK, but nothing special.  The service was also OK, nothing special-the coffee came much later than the dessert and we had to ask for the milk twice.  I honestly don't understand all the hype about the place because neither the food, nor the service/atmosphere were something you could say ""Wow"" about, which is sad, because often, I discover a place through a business lunch and become so impressed that I take my husband there and depending on how expensive it is, we either become regulars, or, go there on special occasions.  Of course, if I am invited to Molyvos for a business meal again, I will go, but I won't be spending my hard-earned money here.",0,1,0,Baby S.,"Oceanside, NY",0,698,0
3.0,3/16/2013,"This is acceptable Greek food if you are in the area, but nothing spectacular. The problems:Pros:- Good selection of fish, served de-boned- Grilled prawns were great- Octopus was ok, nothing noteworthy though.- The oil on the table was surprisingly very good- Dessert was reasonably goodCons:- Served pita slices instead of a real rustic Greek bread - When you see this in a Greek restaurant, it's normally a bad sign as it's trying to please American's false perceptions of Greek cuisine, rather than trying to re-create and share authentic Greek cuisine.  - Poor selection of meze and appetizers, cold meze like melitzanosalata was quite poor- My fish was served with mustard dressing instead of oil and lemon...a 50$ grilled fish can't be tasted with mustard, it's wasting a great piece of fish. I hope they don't serve the rest of their fish like this. In a Greek restaurant, you shouldn't have to even ask for oil and lemon, it's implied.- Boring, dark ambiance playing jazz music- Expensive, but it's NY",0,0,0,Greg P.,"New York, NY",1,51,0
2.0,3/15/2013,"I don't know a good word to describe my experience, but I was truly bewildered by the manager's arrogance.  Despite the tight tables, and I do mean that your elbow is touching the next person, my colleague and I felt that the food was adequate but certainly overpriced compared to other restaurants.   We were offered the bread basket, but we said no thank you we have a food allergy.  The waitress asked if we would like to have a plate of cucumber instead and we were both very pleased to see that she came up with a creative idea and we accepted the offer.   At the end of dinner, the bill arrived with a $5 charge for the few slices of cucumber we had in place of the bread.  Thinking this must just be an error I asked the waitress who said she would need to ask the manager.  This took 10 minutes.  I saw them speaking so i was suprised when he approached our table that he smiled, or should I say smirked, and said ""I heard you have a question"".  To cut to the chase, Dimitri (the manager) insisted the cucumber was not free, it is a side dish (which was not indicated as such on the menu) and he insisted to remove the charge.  The $5 is not the issue.  The quesion is why would a manager create negative reviews over a mere $5.   Really????  You have to question his ability and the restaurants understanding of repeat patronage.  But since they seem to survive on tourists, they clearly don't care much for the people who could be regulars.  Dimitri, your $5 cucumber cost you a lot more than that",0,1,0,Bertie B.,"New York, NY",0,31,0

I arrived on my Dahon, which I folded and put in its bag before carrying it into the restaurant. Folded up it's still pretty heavy and bulky. I was delighted that the coat check girl was so accommodating in taking it into her little space at the front of the restaurant.As always, the service was very professional. A variety of staff were wonderfully attentive to our needs but not overbearing or intrusive. We were seated in a booth (always a bonus in my opinion) near the back. Though the decor is a little bland, the room is comfy and pleasant, and even with a packed house the noise level is low. The tables are fairly widely spaced (yay!!!). This is a restaurant where you can have a conversation and not feel you are sharing it with ten other people. We started with cocktails. My cucumber martini was delightful, though perhaps a little sweeter than ideal. My husband had some kind of orange fizz concoction he drained in no time. The octopus appetizer was perfectly prepared and presented. Two of the entrees we had chosen weren't available. I am going to chalk this up to the hurricane disrupting supply but I'd like to be able to try the lamb stew and the salmon another time. As it was, everyone loved their meal. My mother raved about the moussaka; my husband adored his fish (branzino?) prepared in tomato sauce; my 18 year old son had the chicken and declared it good; and my lamb shank was tender and tasty. Oh, and we ordered a side of horta - seasonal greens - which I highly recommend. There was a bit of cheese in there . . . yum.This restaurant is a good solid choice if you happen to be in the area. I mean, I don't go out of my way to go here. It's a nice place to go with family or even to have a meal out alone. It's not terribly creative or trendy. It's not a scene.

2.0,8/30/2012,"I dined at Molyvos for a business dinner with a group of 6. The restaurant came with high recommendations so I was looking forward to an excellent dining experience. The visit started out nicely with an attentive server that quickly passed out menus and took our drink orders, and for me, that is where the nicely part ended. It took more than 10 minutes for the server to return with our drink orders and probably another 20 minutes before he returned to take our meal order. The appetizers took another 30 minutes or so to come out and about an hour and 30 minutes for the actual meal to be served. I was completely underwhelmed by the appetizers, soup and main entrée that I ordered. The appetizer, a lemon chicken soup, was way overboard on the lemon. Yes, I understood what I was ordering but I might as well have ordered lemon juice with a string of chicken. The server agreed to replace the soup with their tomato soup but it was served cold (although it is meant to be a hot soup) and so after the first bite I gave up on that as well. The other appetizers including short ribs, which came out cold and way over-seasoned, and the tzatziki dip was bland (I've had better at Greek restaurants at a mall). I ordered the roasted chicken as my main course with potatoes and again was completely underwhelmed. The meal was served lukewarm at best and while most everything else was over-seasoned this dish lacked any seasoning at all. The chicken was tasteless and tough and the potatoes were limp. I know it sounds weird but I don't know who else to describe it. One of my dining companions that ordered the same entrée also commented on the level of dissatisfaction with this particular entrée.While I was musing over the entire experience, it occurred to me that our server had never returned to refill our water or other drinks.

First off, I was a little turned off because it was a Saturday night at around 8:30 and there were so many empty tables.  They said they are crazy busy before shows and then after that they never really pick up for the rest of the night.  This was the first time I went there, and I remember trying to make reservations in the past and never being able to get one for a friday or saturday night.  They apparently renovated, so now maybe there are more tables to fill?There is authentic greek music in the background, decor is blue and white (comfortable pillows along the bench side of the tables), there are fresh fishies on ice waiting to be thrown on the grill, and the bar area is really nice.  The food was pretty great if I do say so-great flavor.  We shared the Dolmades (grape leaves) and Greek salad- amazing dressing!  My mom got the roasted chicken and I got the Lamb shank with orzo-both great dishes.  Slightly over-priced, but what do you expect in this neighborhood.  I guess I just knock off one star because it's not that incredible family-run restaurant that I'm always hoping to walk into when I try Greek food...",0,0,0,Nikki S.,"Waltham, MA",21,53,0

That said, the population of patrons are mostly non-Greeks and much of the waitstaff is not as well. This doesn't take away at all from the gastronomical experience. I went last night and had the simplest lightest dinner that could be ordered - the Patzaria me Roka salad (beets with arugula, oranges and mini Kefallograviera cheese ball croutons) a side of Feta and a glass of dry white House wine. Coupled with the bread and olive oil, my tummy was satisfied. The desert menu had some very creative takes on traditional Greek deserts. I was most impressed with their version of Ravani, an almond flour based cake steeped in fresh orange marmalade like syrup and dolloped with vanilla and yogurt cream. With a metrio Greek coffee it was the perfect ending to my meal. The previous time, my boyfriend literally licked his plate of Arni Yiouvetsi clean.

We were promptly seated, our somewhat grumpy waiter attended to us, and thus we began...Bread basket: served with melted/whipped Feta cheese/roasted red peppers. Certainly a decent start. Wine: glass of Pinot Noir from Corinthia. Very good, my favorite part of the meal. $14/glass. Salads: About $15/each, and totally soggy. I had the traditional Greek salad which consisted almost entirely of soggy tomatoes and sparse cucumbers, and my dining companion's beet salad was...ok. Nothing impressive. Main dishes: I had the cabbage rolls, which were literally soaked in this heavy yogurt sauce. Perfect for the 90+ set, not so delectable when you have all of your own teeth. DC had the lamb ragout pasta which was a bit better, but still nothing extraordinary. Dessert: Greek yogurt with honey and toasted walnuts. OK. Pretty good, and when you are ordering yogurt for dessert it certainly isn't going to blow your socks off, but I think there was probably ONE toasted walnut crushed and sprinkled. Blah. More nuts! Total bill: $123 + tip. I'd skip it and find something else. The price doesn't really shake me (from what I hear, whaaaa...Midtown is expensive? no way), but the service a bit gruff (though certainly adequate), and the food is really the big miss here.

4.0,12/6/2010,"I'm very glad I ignored some of the negative comments and gave this place a shot because it really satisfied my Greek food craving.To drink, I went with my waiter's recommendation, a glass of the featured syrah. It was full-bodied as promised and I thought it was very satisfying--so much so that I'd buy it to drink at home. I started with the Greek salad, which is loaded with red and orange beefsteak tomatoes, a huge slab of feta, excellent dressing and all of the other ingredients traditionally found in a Greek village salad. The basket of toasted pita and whipped spread (feta and tomatoes perhaps?) was a nice change from the sesame seed-crusted Greek bread and olive oil you usually get in a Greek place. My entree, the lamb shanks, was flavorful and tender, served over orzo in a tomato sauce that had just a hint of nutmeg; it was delicious and on the verge of being too large (I didn't quite finish). I wish I'd had room to try the baklava.I think Molyvos is very close to deserving 5 stars. The food is on par with some of the best Greek food I've ever had, and with a Greek Mom, I have had lots. However I had to ask for bread which is supposed to be served gratis to everyone, and I agree with some others that the prices are a bit high for Greek food, so I'm going with 4 stars.

But this is an expense account kind of place, a restaurant your heart sinks to encounter, because the only reason you're in here is that you're having a lunch meeting with a business contact. You're not even going to enjoy the food and impeccable service anyway, because you're wondering ""How do I ask smart questions while I eat this shrimp kebab?"" or ""Who's paying for this expensive lunch anyway?""That said, I'm sometimes able to push work out of my mind long enough to appreciate the little things about Molyvos: the roe dip in the appetizer platter.

5.0,6/6/2009,"I love that Molyvos has the Restaurant Week lunch special all year long. Unlike other RW menus, the food on the menu is actually really good! The service is always very nice, which is a plus. I love the atmosphere and how even the plates, glasses, and whatnot have a very rustic Mediterranean feel. If you're not going to drink wine, definitely get the iced tea. It's so refreshing, with mint and a cinnamon stick. For starters, both the Horiatiki Salata (a Greek salad) and Dolmades Lahanikon (stuffed grape leaves) were really good. I love that the salad had a huge piece of feta cheese, I was pretty much in heaven. The grape leaves are better at Milos, but still well-prepared. I can't get enough of the olive bread, it's such good stuff. For a main course, the Pastos Solomos is good if you're in the mood for something light. Basically, it's a plate of smoked salmon with arugula with yogurt sauce and some capers. The catch of the day is also good -- sometimes there will be some unusual fish worth trying. The baklava is amazing and probably my favorite part of the meal.  There is so much walnut and honey going on, but it's not overpoweringly sweet -- it's perfect. The ravani is also good, it's an interesting take on the karithopita walnut cake. The food is pricey and it's a step up from the mom and pop restaurants in Astoria, but it's definitely worth it.",3,0,0,Dana F.,"Queens, NY",665,925,146
1.0,5/28/2009,whoa   so sorry   waited a year to get in   too busy for reservation last yearstarted with a bad table in the back opposite the waiters station  whileworking on the grilled octopus  (very good by the way)  I noticed thatthe waiters  who did not have much to do were standing there watchingus   so I said  whatta ya going to do stare at us thru the whole mealI asked the hostess to move us to a better table....very nicethen came the beet salad which was so small it was a jokeand the lamb ribs  which were so sweet and weirdly spiced we didn't want to eat them.... So I asked for the manager Evanggelos who wasvery nice and I told him our problem...  the salad was a joke  I told him that I thought that it was a sample of the salad i was going to get and the ribs were disgusting and We just didn't want to eat here now and I didn't know what to do.....He apologized and took the food we didn't eat off thebill and asked us not to leave  but to order the entrees and if we didn'tlike them there would be no bill.    The lamb chops were actually goodso what you sear them on each side   DUH  but the portion was so stingy3 little chops for $32  tiny portion of smashed eggplant and a little potatocake    Puh-lease  the moussaka was over spiced with cinnamon andnutmeg and I don't know what else.  My friend wouldn't  eat it.  grossmy Greek ancestors were spinning in their respective graves like arottisserie .  I could see why the place was half empty...

3.0,4/11/2009,"The outside and front of the restaurant gave this rustic, mediterranean Greece kinda feel. I was seduced... so we went and dined.We were seated towards the back of the restaurant. It is a huge place but as you walk further along, the space becomes more dodgy in a  gold-plated railings, red velvet curtains and ugly carpet kinda way.They offer a $35 prix fixe menu on top of the regular menu. I got the dips for starters, grilled fish for entree and yogurt for dessert. The dips were decent and I can't help comparing it to those at Pylos, which were better. Not sure what kind of fish they served me but it was white-fleshed and cooked well, but not much flavor. The fish came on a bed of vegetable stew which went well together. Very Greek grandma cooking feel.Others at my table got the chicken and orzo which was tasty and again, very home-style. Desserts were basic and our tab came up to $200 for 4 before gratuity. A little pricey for the quality, lacklustre service and ambience. It'd earn an additional star if it was cheaper and less dodgy.",0,0,0,Melissa T.,"New York, NY",3,65,0

Not exactly an intimate setting, it felt like a big chain restaurant.Next, the waiter came to tell us about the special and he was constantly shooting nervous glances around the restaurant, it seems like he couldn't maintain eye contact. Not very professional.The menu seemed relatively comprehensive and authentic. I ordered the free range chicken, and it was pretty tasty, but not memorable.

3.0,3/12/2009,"I think maybe the misunderstanding with Greek food is that it's tasty and great to eat, but I don't really know if it's meant to WOW you. How often do you hear people say that Greek is their FAVORITE cuisine? I mean, unless of course they are Greek. The restaurant is big. I imagine you can get in pretty easily without a large wait. We had a reservation and came before a show so it wasn't crowded, but it wasn't completely empty either. There's a great Mediterranean beer list and my boyfriend and I went with some Greek beers to stay true to the cuisine. The waiter was friendly and helpful in helping us with the beer selection. There are plenty of wines to choose from too. Boyfriend went with the Pre-Theatre/Restaurant Week/Appetite Stimulus menu for $35 and we picked basically all the things with the additional charge (salad and baklava). I really liked the feta on the tomato and cucumber salad and because it comes with so much feta, we were still nibbling on it by itself after eating everything else on the plate. The chicken and lamb chops were both cooked perfectly and were amazingly tender. I noticed other people had some complaints about the baklava, but I think it's kind of hard to screw up baklava and it has great flavor no matter what you do. I guess you could say it's a little pricey. Our bill came out to a little over $100 for 2 people including tax and tip. Honestly though, you're in midtown, it's in a tourist heavy area and this is New York City. I'll go back here if it's convenient or if Boyfriend's parents come to town (they love Greek food), but I don't see myself rushing back any time soon. 3.5 Stars because I have no complaints, but I wasn't WOWed either.",0,1,0,Crystal T.,"New York, NY",28,88,0

One of my friends paid the $2 supplement for the salad (there was A LOT of feta cheese on it), and the two other ones got the stuffed grape leaves, which they really liked.The entrees were good, but the portions were somewhat overwhelming. I got the fish, which I really liked, but I couldn't even get close to finishing it because I wanted to save room for dessert. One of my friends got the chicken, which she said wasn't anything special, and the other two got the Lahano Dolmades, which they raved about.For desserts, I got the baklava, which was a little sweater and denser than I usually like it. Two of my friends got the Galaktoboureko, while the other got the almond cake, and I think their desserts were better than mine.All in all, the food was good, but I wasn't super impressed.",2,0,1,Anuja G.,"New York, NY",47,123,7

She had the chicken dish, which she liked. The desserts were great, I had the custard in phyllo, which was excellent, and she had the almond vanilla cake, which was good. The namesake drink was quite good...kinda like a mint julep, but stay away from the Obama unless you are in the mood for some jungle juice Hawaiian Punch. Its a large place, but well sectioned.

3.0,1/28/2009,"I decided not to go to Anthos for my boyfriend's birthday dinner (also coinciding with restaurant week! SCORE!) and try here instead. While I was a little annoyed at the hostess bouncing our reserved seat from the back of the house to the very front (not my choice at all), I was pleased with the overall ambiance. The waiter looked to be annoyed when my boyfriend was not able to choose a beer once he came to the table. My fault for hogging the drink menu too long. He quickly turned and walked away.As for the food, the warmed pita with the surprise olive loaf slices were a great way to start. The dolmades where flavorful with the lovely hint of sweet followed by the tart of the lemon rind. We both ordered the lamb shanks, which was very surprising to receive enough food to go two meals. At least for me anyway. The meat fell right off the bone and the heavy tomato flavor of the sauce made the meal almost stew like.The baklava was nice to look at. The thin-crusted tower was very dense and hard to eat without breaking the whole thing apart. It was complemented with a very light honey sauce.Overall the food was good for restaurant week even with the baklava and lamb shank adding on a total of $8 to the $35 pre fixe, however, I would need to try other items off the regular menu to really determine if it is worthy of such heavy pricing.

3.0,9/26/2007,"We went to Molyvos for a late dinner after a show. My uncle had heard great things about it and wanted to check it out as he is a Greek food aficionado. It was practically empty when we got there at 11:00pm on a Saturday, and we were quickly seated and our drink and appetizer orders were taken. The waiter then disappeared for way too long and took forever to get our food orders. After we ordered, the apps were brought out - tzatiki was good but the portion was tiny, cheese and olive platter was excellent, greek salad was good (despite containing a little bit of lettuce!!!) but not great (tomatoes were slightly mushy). After apps, the maitre'd approched our table and told us that there had been a little mix up and our orders hadn't gotten into the kitchen in time - - - and now the kitchen was closed. No good. So while he was able to provide one and half of the four entrees we had chosen, two were unavailable and we could only pick from two menu items to replace them. My fish was no longer available and I ended up with the Lahano Dolmades (cabbage wrapped ground lamb, beef, pork and rice, with a yogurt garlic sauce). I hated it. Sauce was bland (not ""spiced"" as claimed), filling was mediocre and cabbage leaves were soggy. However, the entrees that were ordered and available (grilled chicken and lamb shanks) were tasty - especially the lamb shanks, which fell right off the bone. So I'm giving three stars- the manager was very apologetic and gave us our entrees for free, but the overall service was spotty and only half the entrees were acceptable. I might go again if someone else wanted to - I think it has 4 star potential, but service and some food quality needs to be stepped up.",1,0,0,Melissa P.,"Charlotte, NC",25,154,8
5.0,7/5/2007,"We stopped in here looking for just a bite to eat, and Molyvos hit the spot.  Start with the cold mezee, with flavorful spreads of tzatziki and melitzanosalata that blows Kashkaval's out of the water (ok Molyvos is twice as expensive...but I pay for flavor).  The spreads here are delightfully addicting.  The house cured salmon and the sashimi quality tuna with pickles and chickpeas were also quit tasty.  But, the real stars are the scrumptious spinach pie and the just crispy enough piping hot saganaki.  I will have to come back hungrier so I can try the fish entrees.  I was getting jealous as I saw the entrees go to other tables.The wine list here is great-with lots of unusual Greek wines and for the non-alcohol drinkers, the lemonade was  super-refreshing and for dessert the smooth creamy and thick greek yogurt with honey and berries hit the spot .Service was efficient and the space was spacious (a rarity in this neighborhood) .  To top, it off ,Jackie Mason ate at the table next to us.",1,0,2,Jasmine M.,"Manhattan, NY",160,364,0
5.0,5/10/2007,"Went to Molyvos on Easter night with the Greek girlfriend.  We had a really good experience.  They treated us like family, with the introductory ""Christo Anesti!"" to the goodbyes.  The food was delicious.  That night it was a prix fix menu.  It was a total of 5 courses.  I loved the food so did the girlfriend.",0,0,1,Guillermo T.,"Brooklyn, NY",6,16,0
3.0,4/13/2007,"was taken here for a birthday work lunch. I enjoyed the food quite a bit actually, I had the minced lamb (?) ravioli I think and to start I had some very good saganaki (had a undercurrent of sly alcohol taste because that's what they cooked it in). Its a large place, all in all with the diverse menu I might try it again sometime. Ask about the playing card (it was a king of something) that is stuck to the wall somewhere on the left if you go back a ways.",0,0,0,Victor L.,"Brooklyn, NY",340,1059,14
3.0,3/14/2007,"I ate at Molyvos for the first time recently and my experience was pretty much on par with what everybody else said:  the food was outstanding and the service was a bit sketchy.We had to wait forever just to get the intial water and bread on the table, and the woman who waited on us was skittish and not very versed in the menu...when we asked for explanations on the wine list or on certain dishes she didnt seem to know what she was talking about.  There was also a long gap between getting our apps and our entrees...so much so that we had to ask about it.But, the food was absolutely outstanding...all around the table.  The baklava for desert was also the best ive ever had.So, its kind of a ""what are you willing to put up with?"" scenario:  If you dont mind waiting the food is worth it.Oh and as an aside, Paul Newman was eating just a couple tables away.  I was tempted to go ask him if I could borrow some salad dressing but thought better of it.",1,0,1,Jon M.,"Charlotte, VT",27,379,4
2.0,1/23/2007,"I wanted to like this place.  I really did. I heard such good things about it.  So when I saw it on the restaurant week list I jumped to make my reservation.  Sadly, Molyvos did not make the grade.  The food was ok.  My appetizer of a Hariatiki Salad (chunks of cucumber, tomato, red onion with a small block of feta) was an additional $4 to the prix fix menu.  I can understand supplements, but for cucumber and feta? It was good...but I'm still confused why cucumber and tomato warranted extra  cost.  Perhaps they were special... who know.  The braised lamb shanks were so soft, the meat fell right off the bone and melted in your mouth. Soft and creamy orzo complemented the dish well.  My dining companion ordered the stuffed cabage leaves and while they were good, the flavor of the stuffing was overpowered by the heavy sauce.  When these type of things are so heavily sauced, you can't help but wonder about the quality of the ingredients and why they're trying to hide it.  Dessert was good..rich and creamy yogurt with a sweet quince spoon.  The sweet of the quince perfectly complemented the tang of the yogurt. So why only 2 stars you ask? Because I don't care how good the food is, nothing could make up for the absymal service we received.  We were seated in the front room which was emptying out as it was after the pre-theatre rush.  We were not offered a beverage or a glass of wine while we perused the menu.  When our waiter came to take our order he rushed us through ordering all three courses.  When my companion asked the waiter the pronunciation of the yogurt dessert he looked down at his pad and said ""Yogurt"" (gee thanks asshole).  When we asked him to reccomend a wine (which we had to practically grab his ankles to keep him from walking away after taking our food order) he pointed to a wine by the glass and said ""its like merlot"".  We ordered two glasses. If the schmuck would have reccomended a bottle we would have ordered it.  It happened to be a good glass of wine but most definitely NOT a merlot.  After that we never saw him again.  Busboys cleared and served, refilled water glasses but our waiter never approached us once during hte rest of the meal.  Never to ask if we wanted another glass of wine (which we would have had), never to check to see if we were enjoying our food (we were), never asked if we wanted coffee or perhaps an after dinner drink or ouzo or something (again...we would have had it if it was offered). Instead we were left alone with a clear table and empty water glasses for about 15 minutes when the waiter placed our check on the table without so much as a goodnight or a thank you.  Now I am not one to tip poorly...ever.  I was a bartender, my brother a waiter and my father a bartender for about 40 years.  How well I ate as a child depended on how well dad did behind the bar.  So it actually causes me pain to leave a low tip.  This time? No pain involved.  We left a minimal 10% but ONLY because we knew it would be split amongst the busboys.  If not, I would have left nothing.  I don't care if its restaurant week and you're bothered by all the ""cheap"" people coming into your restaurant.  We all know its not that great a deal. Dinner for two with a glass of wine and crappy tip still came to over $60 per person and did not merit that kind of service.I will never be back...and I will never ever reccomend it.  And if I see that schmuck of a waiter on the street I'll smack him for ruining what could have been a very nice night for two friends that hadn't seen each other in a long time. Oh well...at least it gave me something to Yelp about...",4,1,2,Maryanne N.,"Keyport, NJ",38,169,0
4.0,8/31/2006,"I've eaten here a few times, but for some reason I always feel way too young to be eating here.  It's a fancy greek place with basic greek food done up right.  I've only been for lunch, and I'm sure the location makes it quite the power-lunching spot for the Midtown West set.  But everyone here seems to be 40+ and in a suit (not that there's anything wrong with that...) and this is appropiate, I suppose, because both times I was eating here I was with 40+ year/old men in suits.  One my old boss, and one an older singer friend.  They have a pretty good lunch prie fixe special that doesn't totally break the bank.  And they're baklavah is outsanding.  I'd definitely give it a shot, but it sure made me feel young...",3,3,4,Sam P.,"New York, NY",1869,875,636
4.0,8/31/2006,"I just love this place.  I have been here several times over the years and always say to myself that I need to come back more often.  The problem is that it is not in a part of town that I spend lots of time in after work.Enough about me, the food is great.  You can sit at the bar, which has lots of seating and friendly bartenders, or you can sit in the restaurant itself which seems to go back forever.Some of my favorites--Keftedes with Red Sauce (lamb meatballs), Grilled Octopus, and the Saganaki (the infamous flaming fried cheese).  The fish and lamb entrees have all been impeccably cooked too.I will be back soon...",1,0,1,John H.,"New York, NY",55,49,0
2.0,8/28/2006,"Sadly...nothing remotely Mezze was on their Restaurant Week Menu (3 courses for $35), a menu which should, in my mind, showcase what the restaurant has to offer to draw you back again after restaurant week to spend more of your hard-earned money.Molyvos fell short... the Lentil Soup was tasty. It came with a Lagana bread, toasted and some olive tapenade. I'm allergic to olive meat (olive oil is A-OK) and I asked to have the tapenade spread left off (sad olive allergy)... instead they just decided not to bring the bread.The Lahano Dolmades (Cabbage Leaves Filled with Ground Lamb, Beef, Pork & Arborio Rice with Spiced Yogurt Garlic Sauce)... the garlic sauce was distracting...just OK.The dessert was...eh... I did have a glass of wine that was decent...but the waiter never came back to us with what it was called...he just asked what we like from Italian wine and brought us what he thought we'd like. Bummer...it was good...I would have loved the name of a Greek Wine that I liked.Basically - I can't recommend the place to anyone...perhaps at some point I'll go back and try the Mezze Plate...",1,0,1,Kimberli M.,"New York, NY",124,423,156

Molyvos is not really a takeout kind of place...at all, but I'm sure that Tony gets to do whatever he wants.Fish at Molyvos is the real attraction - we ordered a whole dorade and our friendly waiter expertly fileted it at our table for us. Dips were fabulously tasty - taramosalata, tzatziki, eggplant and yes, the saganaki was incredible and impressively flaming. We skipped dessert, but I'll be back for the famous baklava one of these days. Maybe Tony will join me for a coffee.",0,0,0,Christy V.,"Boulder, CO",384,514,339
