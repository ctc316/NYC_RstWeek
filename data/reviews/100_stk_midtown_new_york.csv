1.0,4/22/2019,"Came here TONIGHT to celebrate my boyfriends birthday along with my brother and that's was the worst mistake! I called the restaurant to inform them that I was running late and the hostess said it was fine. We arrived and she said ""Your NOT on the list but it's ok we have open tables because it's a slow night"". Once seated she told my brother ""your not allowed to wear that outfit but it's slow so it's fine and remove your hat"". We were skipped and waited longer than 20 mins for a server not even being offered water. We eventually left , I informed the hostess that we were unhappy and she didn't even bother to ask any questions. I do not recommend this place! Very racist and RUDE. Wish I knew the Hostess name I would love to report her! STK midtown is not the place for young African American people!

We started off with the tuna tartar, caesar salad and burrata. The tuna tartar was okay, the caesar salad was tasty but way over dressed. The burrata was quite nice.I ordered the 12oz filet and was a bit more than medium rare. The flavor was def there and was nicely seasoned.

4.0,4/7/2019,"Sooo it has changed so much since I been there four ago. The atmosphere had a different vibe. The waitress we had which I already forgot her name was great ! So kind and helpful, always checking in with us. Made sure the steak was at a right temperature to refilling our drinks. There was an a group of two parties fighting with each other and they had to make one group leave. I do not blame the restaurant fully for this but it use to be businessmen and women, a sophisticated vibe and now I saw younger guys wearing Addias hoodies and sneakers. Things you should not be allowed to wear. I look at it in perspective, if I'm paying $300 for a meal there should not be certain things going on. The manager I think (she was blonde) apologized and our waitress for the situation going on which was out of their hands. Yet like I said they should watch more who they let in. The food was great, even though I liked the asparagus better the last time. Overall it was good experience and o really appreciate the staff there.",0,0,1,Alyssa G.,"New York, NY",17,52,36

4.0,3/18/2019,"Recommended by the concierge at my hotel when I asked for a good steak on arrival and I wasn't disappointed.  I was on biz so sat at the bar, it was Monday but even so there was a good vibe.  They have got the setup spot on here with a good lounge mix with lively restaurant.  Music added good vibe and volume just right.   Had the NYK strip with asparagus and Brussel sprouts - all of it was lovely.  The steak menu options looked great - the strip was a good size, I'm a big eater and I was very happy.Some minor gripes - the bar seating isn't comfortable for eating at the bar, something to do with room for legs and height of the bar to seat, I felt like I was having to lean to get to my food.  The sides are pretty expensive but also HUGE! Definitely sized for sharing - which makes them pretty pricey for sides -$15 each.Bar service was friendly and attentive.  It's well worth a trip, but maybe best with 2+ rather than solo.Bon appetit!",0,0,0,Michael O.,"Beverly Hills, CA",0,7,0
4.0,3/18/2019,"Took a trip into the city with my boyfriend and planned days prior to eat at this establishment. I've been waiting a while to try their famous steak and enjoy a wonderful meal. I made a Saturday night reservation for 2 at 9:15 on Thursday evening. I received a call the next morning confirming my reservation. We arrive on Saturday at 9:15 and had to wait about 15-20 minutes after checking in with the host. There were other guest waiting as well. When it was finally our turn we were sat by the window out looking the streets, their were large flower bouquets in the middle of the dining area and the music was great! More hip hop and modern pop. The waiter was great and they always refilled my water without asking! Our steaks arrived quickly and were cooked to perfection!

1.0,3/7/2019,"I was pretty appalled by my dining experience at STK. I do not think I have ever felt so disappointed by a dining experience, food and management in my life.This restaurant is extremely aesthetic pleasing and very well designed. However, the appeal of this restaurant ends there. My father and his friend had made a reservation on Tuesday night and then invited me to join them. Their reservation was originally for two however an hour before I was two arrive they asked the FOH staff if they could add a person. They told them this would not be an issue. However, upon arrival they could no longer accommodate this request which was surprising because there were several empty tables visible to us that were never filled during out hour and a half long dinner. I have no problem admitting this was somewhat our own fault but FOH should have been more responsible and apologetic. They made us squeeze into a table for two and basically brushed it off as our own fault. The food, highly disappointing especially for the price. I had the market fish, which was halibut, and it came tepid, lacking any flavor and as dry as sawdust. I believe this fish was frozen. My companions ordered steaks and sides. The sprouts and creamed corn were good. The steaks, one was good the other was tough and unexciting. After eating we were joined by another person and moved to an empty bar (next to empty tables that would have seating three people easily) to order drinks. At this time we asked to speak to a manager just to speak about the issues we had. We did not go in guns a-blazing, we were actually all pretty happy to be with each-other and just wanted to alter management to FOH issue we had...However, this manager was the rudest more passive aggressive person I have ever met. Worst customer service ever. I strongly suggest they fire this man. He basically blamed the whole situation on us. Said there were no empty tables (even though we could see them during this conversation), and then claimed they have comped out drinks... which they hadn't at all. Even more so we had this conversation while our bill sat on the bar in full view so there was no confusing this fact. He only apologies after my male companions asked him to leave as they were upsetting an already bad experience. People or yelp, do not go here. People of STK, fire your manager.",1,0,0,Davis T.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",215,82,26
2.0,3/7/2019,"Wasn't the best experience for me.. brought my boyfriend here for his 29th birthday. So upon arrival the restaurant was quiet & a completely different vibe from the last time we had come, cool, we were there to eat anyway. The bread comes, cold and whatever creamy stuff it had in the middle was gross. Our food took over an HOUR to come. It was so bad that our waiter kept telling us, it'll be right out until he seemed embarrassed and stopped coming to our table completely. No waiter meant, empty glasses & clearly we were having drinks and would've liked a second one, we even had empty water glasses. A whole hour and 15 minutes later our food comes , after we watched all the patrons who came in after us get their food in a timely manor. I was ready to walk out at this point but the waiter gave us a free extra side which was good (but did not apologize for the ridiculous wait)... I cut open my steak and it is cold and bloody, I ordered medium which means I don't want my steak squirting blood on me. I was so disappointed but was trying to save face for my boyfriend, then the waiter forgot it was his birthday & came over and asked if we wanted desert.... like um I told you when we first got here that I wanted ""the cloud"" after we were done eating. But I wouldn't remember that 2.5 hours later either.

2.0,2/28/2019,"Nice ambience but the service wasn't great. We ordered the Shaved Brussel Sprouts to start. The salad was bitter and it really could have used some sweetness from the barely there apples and almonds to balance it out. I got the wagyu flat iron steak as my entree and it was not cooked evenly. I asked for medium and as I sliced from left to right, you could see that it was progressively cooked: raw and bloody on the left end, medium rare in the center, and medium on the right end. I wanted to send it back to be cooked more and the waitress was nowhere to be found. When the table next to us was served, we asked the server if he could get the waitress for us. She came and used her cellphone flashlight to look at the steak and asked me ""that's too rare for you?"" I felt that was a silly question given that the blood was oozing too much for something that should be medium.  It was too raw to even be considered medium rare. Once the kitchen returned my sliced up steak, it was actually tasty. It didn't go well with the salty chimichurri sauce. It was better with the STK sauce which was sweeter and tangy.",0,0,0,Wendy M.,"New York, NY",2,60,289

5.0,2/21/2019,"I'm not usually one for steakhouses, but STK Midtown is one of my favorite restaurants in NYC! Its big, beautiful space makes for the perfect atmosphere for having a business lunch/dinner or just enjoying a meal with friends.I have been here a handful of times, and each time the food is superb. A dish that is a MUST-GET every time is the cream corn pudding- it's a dish that I dream about and continuously crave. Not the healthiest option but definitely worth the calories!!!On this visit, we started with the burrata, which is served with pomegranate and pear. I've never had fruit with burrata, but it was delicious! Perfect combination of sweet and salty. We split it among 4 people, but it only comes with 2 pieces of bread, so I would recommend for a group of 2.I got the Lobster on brioche for lunch. It didn't come in a brioche bun (which I was actually happy about because that's usually too much bread) but instead came on buttered toast. I paired it with fries, and they're shoestring and so good. There was plenty of lobster inside the sandwich, and I ate every last bite! The rest of my crew got the STK salad (had a nice amount of steak on it) and the classic burger (delicious and big!).Overall, another fabulous experience at STK, and I can't wait to go back (for my cream corn)!",0,0,0,Elizabeth F.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",1,9,20

3.0,2/13/2019,"Trendy midtown steakhouse with decent food / less ok serviceExperienceThe evening started off on a negative note. It was Thursday of restaurant week, and I made a reservation at 8:45. My entire party arrived on time, but our table wasn't ready for another 30 or so minutes. I guess this is a product of it being restaurant week and the place being packed, but waiting 30 minutes despite showing up on time & with a reservation is a bit excessive. The crowd leans older and trendier, so maybe you'd get better service if that's  your aesthetic. The hostesses are kind of unfriendly as well, but I'd say that attitude is pretty standard for ""clubby"" types of restaurants in the city. At the very least, I'd expect the hostess to offer to check our coats while our table was getting ready, but she just kind of acted like I wasn't there. To be honest, the food was fine, but the atmosphere was too much for my taste (akin to other clubby restaurants such as Tao).  The DJ is loud. I came with a group of 4 people and could not hear what anyone was saying. After a while, I just gave up trying to speak the rest of my group and essentially only had a conversation with my friend next to me, which was kind of annoying. A positive, however, is the venue. I loved the way the tables were laid out and the décor is also pretty on point.FoodMy review is of the Feb. 2019 restaurant week menu. I had fried oysters, branzino/brussel sprouts, and a warm chocolate chip cookie for dessert.Appetizer: fried oysters. The portion sizes were small, but they tasted great. See photo below. There was aioli type of  sauce on top that was super delicious.Entrée: I had a seared branzino with brussel sprouts. It tasted pretty great but was way too heavy (TBH if I wanted something heavy, I'd order a steak). I think the reason for this is because they used way too much butter. Even the Brussel sprouts were bathed/soaked in butter, which made the dish yummy but also somewhat unappetizing. The fish was cooked well and had a crispy skin. Just...lay off the butter.Dessert: The desert was probably the best part. The flavors were standard but classic. I ordered the warm chocolate chip  cookie which was a cookie-muffin hybrid. It paired nicely with the vanilla ice cream on the side. Despite being full, I quickly ate the whole thing (as did the rest of my group).",0,0,0,Anushka M.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",320,14,18

2.0,2/9/2019,"STK happy hour  in SoBe is awesome! STK Midtown drink and bar food portions are smaller, cheapening the experience. The bartender stiffed me on the drinks and the happy hour menu portions were much smaller in comparison. I poured the drink into another glass without the ice in front of the manager. It was maybe 8 oz at the most. Wouldn't even fill a martini glass!  The other bartender continued to serve the same small size so it's obviously what they are told to do, stiff the customers a few ounces each. Cheapened the whole experience... Even the mini burger meat and mini steak quality was inferior to SoBe's experience. The oysters were smaller. SoBe served water to everyone.

3.0,2/4/2019,"I came here during NYC Restaurant Week on a Friday night. It was very busy as expected at 6pm, but we were seated very quickly for our 6pm reservation. The 3 course menu included a variety of their most popular items like the tuna tar tar and steak sliders for extra and the regular salads and fried oysters to choose from, main course included their 8 oz strip steak, chicken, fish, and veggie choices and finally dessert was either chocolate chip cookie with ice cream or key lime cheesecake. The food was nothing to rave about. It wasn't bad, but we had higher expectations. We ordered medium well steak and the outside was burnt and the inside was more medium rare.

I must say the place is very nice on the inside, good music played while we were there.  Pros: Ambiance very niceRachel our server was very kind & attentive Food was slightly better than average, i had the strip steak, brussel strouts, fingerling smash potatoes, and added 2 grilled shrimpCons:Grilled Shrimp were definitely overcooked and taste was overwhelmed by the char on themPlate presentation of main course was severely disappointing, for a steakhouse the presentation was quite frankly unacceptable.Bread wasnt brought to our table in timely fashion, tables that were seated after our table were served bread. I had to ask the gentleman that brought the appetizers to our table for the bread, he looked perplexed when i did so. I got our server's attention and she too couldn't understand why our tanle hadnt received any bread.  She went ahead and made sure it was brought to our table.For dessert we finished off with their keylime cheesecake.

1.0,1/23/2019,"I came to STK Midtown very enthused to enjoy a nice steak since I had heard many nice reviews about this restaurant. The venue has beautiful decoration and a live DJ. Unfortunately, our waitress seemed less than joyous to be serving us. She was flat-out peeved that we were asking her questions about the menu. She somewhat  appeared upset that I was even there.                                    My girlfriend and I ordered appetizers, main course and dessert, but our waitress seemed too entertained gossiping with her colleagues to bring us our food out. Our neighboring guests arrived at their table 30 mins after we did and left 30 mins before us. Our steaks came out cold which mean that they were ready and she just wasn't paying attention to us. Our dessert which was suppose to be a warm cookie came out 25 mins later and frozen in the middle.  We were there for 2 hours and never got any water refills and when we asked for some sprite/ginger ale she sucked her teeth. The neighboring guest turned to us and asked us what was her problem with us, we shrugged and said she must be having a bad day. Ultimately, not our fault. Also at the end when she brought us our almost 200$ bill she was super nice because she wanted a nice tip.                                  Honestly this is the first time I've said this but this lady was African American and seemed to be upset to be serving another minority couple. Message to the waitress - You should be profesional and serve us the same she would have served another couple, I could've gotten the same cold steak with better service at the neighboring Applebee's or chili's for a fraction of the cost.                                    All in all, im pretty sure the restaurant is amazing and the food looked delicious if we got in within the 10-15 mins it was cooked.",1,0,0,Jose C.,"Old Saybrook, CT",188,2,0

Only one person ordered a cocktail and one couple shared a meal which had to be sent back because the steak had an extremely heavy charcoal, burnt taste.

So personable. We got oysters which were super fresh and of course the steak. The filet was probably the best steak I've ever had! They offer small medium and large options. I ordered the small but definitely would recommend medium if you're hungry. Their mac and cheese side was incredible as well! Lastly, their music selection at this place is next level.

3.0,1/14/2019,"Since the price point of STK is comparable to Del Frisco's I am comparing them in this review. The food was good, not great, not bad. My husband was NOT a fan of the steak, said it was way too fatty. We should have ordered the filet. That was our mistake. We sent back the truffle fries, the presentation was cute, but I literally didn't taste or even smell truffle on them. Initially, it was something I wasn't going to complain about but felt compelled to say something. The waiter validated my opinion, not sure if that was simply to be kind or if he genuinely agreed. The system of essentially forcing you to ""wait"" for your table at the bar, despite being on time for your reservation and spotting tons of empty tables, is transparent and borderline offensive. Another funny tidbit-there was no attendant in the ladies restroom, only in the men. So, ladies..that is what they think about us and our tipping.

3.0,12/23/2018,"Overall, had a decent experience, but had to notch down on value and inconsistency (the inconsistency of service from our observation). Checking in was a bit chaotic. We got seated about 25 minutes after our reservation, which wouldn't normally be a problem if my wife wasn't 8 months pregnant, but we were told initially it would only be a few minutes and decided to wait it out. They sat us down promptly after I told them ""my wife is pregnant"" (probably should have just told them at first). While waiting we noticed there were people waiting with reservations ahead of us. One couple lost their temper and left after telling the host they had been waiting more than 30 minutes just to get seated for their reservation. Hostess did nothing to stop them, but then again they were wearing Santa hats... I would've probably let them go back home to the North Pole as well. Rating Scale - Yelp Style 1 to 5Ambiance - 5Very chic modern design. Definitely a sweet date place. Wife couldn't stop taking pictures of the flowers, bar and restaurant. I'm sure I would have gotten lucky after dinner if I didn't get lucky 8 months ago.  Food - Overall 31) Bread - 4.5 The bread was amazing. Soft, fluffy and warm. Some type blue cheese sauce on top with a chive dipping sauce. It's free, but we had to ask our server for it cuz he forgot to give it to us initially. Wife doesn't normally like bread but she inhaled this like a Roomba on steroids. 2) Grilled Octopus Starter - 5By far the best dish of the night, grilled perfectly with squid ink sauce. Mmmm. 3) 18 Oz Dry-Aged Bone-In Strip - 2.5We were a bit disappointed with the steak given a $72 price point. For 18 oz, seemed pretty small and came out luke warm. Meat was good but I'm sure it would have been better if it was hot. Other steaks around us looked bigger and much better. Maybe poor selection on our part?4) Creamy Yukon Potatoes - 4Really good gooey mashed potatoes. Scraped the bowl down clean and would have even licked the rest out if it if we didn't have a couple on a date sitting right next to us. 5) Mushrooms - 2.5Nothing really special about this one. Just sautéed mushrooms. Have had it at a hundred other places. 6) The Cloud Dessert - 5 for show 3 for tasteThis was a fun experience, but a bit sweet for our palate. The wife had to get a shot of it though, which is why we ordered it. Service - Us 4, Others 2Seems like we lucked out. Our waiter was good and attentive given how busy things got. From the moment we arrived we kept overheating complaints from others. The table of six next to us were already seated and got their appetizers shortly after we sat down. By the time we ordered and finished our apps and entrees they had not yet gotten their main courses. They had a show they needed to get to and after the two hour mark the patriarch started fuming (luckily his wife calmed him down). The food finally came out they gave everyone the wrong entrees and they had to leave before fully finishing meal to catch their show. Shortly after, we heard another lady behind us complain about a mistaken order. A bit hesitant on if we'd go back again. $72 for a relatively small, luke-warm steak. Things were unorganized and service from our observation was inconsistent and would hate to be on the short end of the stick from that aspect.",3,0,0,David L.,"Manhattan, NY",0,6,1
2.0,12/23/2018,"Went for a Christmas dinner last night and this place seats us all the way in the back in what was very obviously a party room, separated from the vibe of the real restaurant. On top of that they have the AUDACITY to sit us at a table set up that was basically a WEDDING COCKTAIL HOUR SIZE TABLE WITH A BLACK TABLE CLOTH OVER IT. There were several tables like this set-up, and everyone who was forced to sit there was obviously not happy about it. Our waiter was very nice, BUT was also obviously new/nervous and overwhelmed. The meal teetered on the line between comfortable pacing and just bad service.Yes, the food was good (tho not great). I understand it's Christmas and they want to maximize capacity etc., but for a $500 meal you're going to sit us at some fake ass table like that in some annex of your restaurant? I don't think so. Partial blame is on me for even allowing my party to sit down. Would have complained immediately, but we were on a schedule and didn't want to wait a prolonged period in the busy restaurant.

For appetizers I ordered the lil burger and ravioli and there were only 2 pieces in each dish so not sure if it was worth the price. If you get the steak the sauces and sides are separate fee.

1.0,12/10/2018,"I just wanted to start off by saying, never in my life have I written a YELP review. I normally am not the type of person to complain about these things because I used to work in the restaurant industry myself. I went to STK Midtown last night for dinner with my mother and my high school aged sister. My mother has been there once before for drinks and bragged about the atmosphere. First off, we had reservations at 7:30 and was not seated until 8:15. No big deal, except our table was ready the entire time. Annoying. Once we were seated our server was below average. She barley checked up on us and took our appetizer order after about 30 minutes. Getting the bread was another 30 minute wait.All three of us ordered medium filets. We all asked that the filets be prepared medium. We ordered 3 sides mashed potatoes, lobster mac and cheese, and brussel sprouts. The mashed potatoes you buy at grocery stores and heat up in your microwave we're better. The mac and cheese also tasted like it came out of a Kraft box and they threw a few pieces of lobster in there. However, brussel sprouts were pretty good. When our steaks came out they were EXTREMELY rare. Like grossly, rare. We asked the server if they could cook our steaks a little more. She also agreed they were very under cooked and gave us plates to put our raw steaks on to bring back to the kitchen. Kinda weird, but whatever. Twenty minutes later she came back with the steaks in which they were STILL undercooked. The meat was purple. Not exaggeration. We were clearly annoyed, but were nice girls so we just informed the manager about the situation. The manager pretty much told us he's sorry we didn't enjoy our food and hopes we come back again. Like dude, you can't be serious. Whatever. We got the check and all they did was take off 20% of our total. Mind you, we were paying easily over $300 for literally microwaveable sides, and raw steak. I kid you not, the steaks were untouched. I love meat. I really, really do. Never ever ever in my life have I been grossed out from meat like this. No joke, I'm debating becoming a vegetarian. After we got the check, we told the waitress that it was absurd that they didn't take anything off so she took off one steak. Great! So now we paid, $270 for two untouched steaks and microwaveable sides.  Unless you want to throw away money and leave hungry and grossed out, this is not the place for you.",0,0,0,Gabrielle P.,"Broomall, PA",0,1,0

Although the place was loud, the music added to it and made it better. The place gave you energy! People watching was off the charts. I had bags from the hotel and Eric helped me check them. Everyone was friendly. We were seated pretty quickly. I had an OpenTable reservation. Markus our waiter was attentive. My cousin had been bragging about the bread all day! But when it arrived, it wasn't hot. Marcus brought more that was warmer. We all ordered the bone in filet and it was good. I ordered blue cheese crumbles on top but this was crunchy. Not sure what it was. And it wasn't melted or hot. We got four sides: Brussels, Mac and cheese, mashed potatoes, and creamed spinach. None were very hot temperature -wise. I loved the mashed potatoes most but all were very good. I'd like to return and hang out at the bar. It was three people thick the whole night.",1,0,1,Maria-Elena T.,"Arlington, VA",357,1001,2856

We waited an hour and a half on bar for our table (mind you we came in while it was pretty empty and we had reservations). We waited for bread for about 20 minutes and we had to ask 3 different staff members. Our appetizer (Octopus) was ice cold! We had to send it back.

The bartender was really sweet and helped us right away. A few minutes later they sat us at a really gorgeous spacious booth. Amy was our server and she was great. She even wished me a happy birthday. We informed her that we were in a bit of a rush as we were catching a broadway play and she was able to get our food and drinks out to us fairly quick. The atmosphere is beautiful fun and hip. The music was great and we thoroughly enjoyed ourselves. We shared the porterhouse steak with Alaskan king crab and a red wine sauce mac and cheese and Parmesan truffle fries for our sides and everything  was so delicious and flavorful.

It was a relatively quiet night since he mentioned there's usually a DJ there. Onto the food...we started off with an app of grilled octopus which was amazing. Tender and flavorful and just enough. I ordered the wagyu skirt steak with bone marrow and my bf ordered the special - butcher's cut ribeye with truffle butter. Both were amazing tender and delicious cuts of meat. The only ""throwaway"" dishes of the night that we didn't finish off were the sides of parmesan truffle fries and the brussel sprouts. They weren't bad, just not as delicious as the rest of the meal. We finished off dinner with a lovely dessert of warm chocolate chip cookie with vanilla ice cream along with some coffee. Overall perfect evening and memorable dinner.

The first time was right off my flight from Los Angeles, I was starved and really needed something yummy but not heavy, I had the tuna tartare and the sliders... Second visit, I sat at the bar after to much shopping and walking in heels, I was quickly greeted by Jennifer, who Let me know that I made it right under the wire for happy hour (half off almost everything at the bar). I took Jennifer's recommendation on the Caesar salad (the yummiest Caesar ever) and tuna tacos, she also made the drink called, I think, dirty pearls, it was perfect. I found sitting at the bar so cool, I felt though super trendy, it was comfortable, and I know that had a lot to do with who the bartender was.

5.0,9/7/2018,Before I get into my review I have to do a shoutout for my waiter JUSTIN! He accommodated us with such professionalism! He was able to tell us about all the steaks and how they are prepared.I personally went with the wagyu steak selection! It was prepared medium. It melted in my mouth. Justin paired my steak with a complimentary wine. I believe it was a Cabernet Sauvignon but I forget what brand. Since I went with my cousin and my brother I tried their steaks (Sirloin & Dry-Aged Delmonico 14 Oz) they were both great but if i had to compare it to the wagyu. The wagyu is a MUST! Especially if you have never had it before. It's a great treat! The complimentary bread was topped with a butter that went well together. The Cesar salad was like any Cesar salad...nothing spectacular. And Mac and cheese and fries were good and had enough of everything. The cocktail I had for the night was Calm before the Storm! The prefect Summer drink! I have tried their strawberry cobbler previously and I personally didn't like the graham cracker on the glass. Overall experience...it was great.

This restaurant is a nice romantic place to go to for the views though I think its everything else about it is not much to rave about.First the most impress thing about this place I feel is the views. Across the whole restaurant they have huge windows across the walls to show you the view of 43rd street. Its really nice and is a lot different from other restaurants I have been to.Besides the nice views though it has a very modern atmosphere inside of it. Honestly, I wasn't really impressed by it. To me the atmosphere felt kind of lifeless and dull. It doesn't really give me any type of feel except ""this is modern architecture."" Totally the opposite of a rustic restaurant which I usually prefer.The food here was ok I suppose. It certainly had good presentation which I have to give it brownie points for. The actual food though again didn't impress me though. The shrimp appetizer doesn't really give you a lot of shrimp (I think it was like 3?) and my steak was a little tougher then I would like. The dessert was really good though.Overall STK Midtown is a nice date spot but it is personally not the type of restaurant I would go to to enjoy myself.

It was definitely not the place to be if you were looking for a quick lunch. The staff took their time and allowed us to enjoy a nice meal without feeling like we had to rush back to the office. The fries were massive- these are thicker than steak fries so having an order by itself will be like eating an entire potato with your burger... unless that's your thing -  no judgement. When we were ready to settle the bill, our server took a liking to us and brought us over some coffee on the house- the coffee was delicious (also, it goes without saying- be kind to people who are serving you!

4.0,8/22/2018,"STK is a REALLY cool place with an excellent vibe. I would give the decor and interior a 5++. Our service was excellent as well. We started off with the short rib ravioli (come with two, we added one more since there were three of us) and the tuna tartare. The ravioli had a really unique and excellent flavor. I also really enjoyed the tuna tartare, although there was not necessarily anything special about it compared to other places. I then had the shaved Brussel sprout salad which was AWESOME. It comes with goat cheese and almonds and the almonds just really added a unique element. For my main I had the branzino which was a special that night. To be honest I wasn't particularly impressed. It was good, don't get me wrong, but nothing special for the price.  My dad and his wife got the 16 Oz ribeye with truffle butter and the sea bass. The ribeye was TO DIE FOR. It was easily the best part of the night so far. We also ordered the truffle fries which were not very good. They look like big cheese logs, but are fries. Pass on them. For dessert we tried the Dulce donuts and the salted caramel bandino. Both were UNBELIEVABLE. Drinks, SO GOOD. Our table had the basil margarita, watermelon lemonade, and a dirty martini and each was phenomenal. The reason I didn't give this 5 stars was simply for the price. Although most of the food was good (especially the steak!) I don't think it was worth the price. I recognize it is New York, but even for New York the price was high for something that was not out of this world. The bill in total was well over 550 dollars.

Anyways, our dinner reservations was for 7:15pm and we got there at 6:35pm. Since he couldn't find our reservations on his end, I told him I'll cancel the reservations and rebook it then. At this point, I was a bit annoyed. I mean you have 3 hostess upfront and there's a line to check in to our dinner reservations. If we weren't waiting for our friend, we probably would've left and went somewhere else. Since our friend was still on his way, we just stood aside and waited. As we were waiting, we notice the front desk area was getting crowded and one of the hostess told the guests to move aside, didn't seems too friendly either. I mean where can these guests move to when you won't seat everyone until they all arrived? It seems so unorganized and not so professional. My husband and I got a drink at the bar area and we ended up getting a table since we stood around the bar for a bit and the bartenders didn't seems like they were even looking up to take our drink orders either. And it wasn't that busy at the bar. So we ask the waitress if the table was available and had to get our drinks through her.

There was a DJ playing at 6:30 pm. It felt more like a nightclub than a restaurant. When I arrived for my reservation, my table wasn't ready, so I waited about 5-8 minutes. I got a great table! The rest of this review will go downhill. I waited at least 10+ minutes for my waitress to greet me and another few minute for a glass of warm water (it was 90+ degrees outside so I was thirsty). About 10-15 minutes AFTER that, she took my drink order. The drink came very fast to the table with bread service. The bread with cilantro dipping sauce was the highlight of my meal! Oh and they charge you for the bread service without asking you. A BIG NO NO!!!!! It was restaurant week, but I decided to order off the main menu. Another mistake. I ordered the Sea Bass with lemon aioli, heirloom tomatoes, and wilted mustard greens. When my meal arrived, there was no aioli, the greens were burnt and they was NO SEASONING! It was so bland I had to ask for salt and the aioli. Thank goodness I ordered the mushrooms on the side, because they were much better than my fish. When I complained to my waitress she clearly did not care that I was an unsatisfied customer. I did get the last laugh though.

We got the short rib, Caesar salad, sea bass, Mac & cheese and a bunch of other sides. The sea bass was the tastiest dish and it was kind of like a play on a fish sandwich. I once paid over $100 for a ""cheesesteak"" from an upscale steakhouse here in Philly and it was INCREDIBLE! So paying for great food isn't a problem.

2.0,8/1/2018,"First off, I really wanted to like this place. Service is very good, waiters are attentive. Ambiance is awesome, the decor is top notch. Food presentation was pretty good. But the main reason to go to a restaurant, the food, was very disappointing. I came here for restaurant week dinner, opted for the Angus cowgirl upgrade for an additional $30 (because i LOVE steak), and the wagyu slider for an additional $5. For two people I spent $150 including tax and tips, which is a great price for 3 courses at an upscale steakhouse. IF THE FOOD WAS GOOD. My date got the cod croquette for appetizer which was overly salty. I got the wagyu ""lil bgr"" which is a slider with what is I guess waygu beef. The sauce overpowered the wagyu beef which defeats the purpose of having the slider made of wagyu beef.Moving on to the main course, my date got the dry aged strip. She ordered medium well (I know, that's an abomination) but they gave her a steak cooked medium rare. When we told the waiter, he said ""we make our medium well pink in the middle. That's not the definition of medium well buddy. We hate  sending food back, but we had to. The kitchen pretty much threw it under the broiler for little longer to burn the outside and better cook the inside. Not what I expected from a steakhouse, any other steakhouse would have cooked up another strip, but maybe that's just what i'm used to. For my cowgirl steak, I really regret paying more money for this nonsense. There's barely any beef flavor. On a nice piece piece of ribeye? How? I'll admit it's very tender, but for a steak to lack much beef flavor... I might as well drink a smoothie. Main highlight of the dinner was a huge letdown. I would like a moment of silence for my wallet. Dollars have been wasted on this steak. On to last course, dessert. The part of the meal to ease you back into reality with a good impression of the meal. The lasting impression to a good meal, or a saving redemption from a mediocre meal. We tried both the sorbet and the warm chocolate cookie. Sorbet is not bad, it's subtle fruit flavors, refreshing for a warm summer day. The warm chocolate cookie... I've had better at Uno's. The waiter hyped it up saying it's to die for. I really love a warm cookie with ice cream in the middle, and it's really not that hard to do. Might have been because we did the restaurant week special, but mine seems like it's been sitting a little. The chocolate cookie came in a cup shape, with a scoop of vanilla in the center. This dessert would have been awesome if the outside wasn't hard like a crunchy cookie, and if the inside was soft and warm. I didn't even finish it, and i am a huge dessert guy, I finish anything sweet, even if I'm full. Overall, a very disappointing meal in a very classy restaurant. I came in with dreams, and walked out with crushed dreams. Hopefully everyone else who comes here has a much better culinary experience than we did. To me, I would not consider this establishment a serious steakhouse. More of a hip date spot to show off on Instagram or something. When you take away the service and decor, the food is below average. When you factor in the price of the food, it is embarrassing. I almost feel scammed.*** Edit: The response from management seems to be a generic response to seem like they're trying to resolve a problem.

3.0,7/30/2018,"Let me start by saying, I am a huge STK fan. I have been to the Vegas location, and the meat packing location and now the midtown location. My sister and I had reservations and started out our evening at the bar to have a drink before dinner. The bartenders were very busy, so we had to ask for drink menus. After standing there a few mins, we had a couple of questions about the drink menu. I tried to ask one of the bartenders a simple question, and was rudely cut off with ""he'll be with you in just a minute"" while pointing to another bartender. We finally got drinks served, but felt as if we were a hassle to the bar staff, and they were put out. The restaurant was 1/3 of the way full at 8pm, and we asked to be seated at a larger empty booth instead of the small tables lined by the window all crammed together. These tables were loud, and no privacy between you and the couple sitting next to you. We were told no, that we can't sit at larger booths because they are reserved for larger parties. Ok, that's understandable. We sat there almost until they closed, and none of those booths were ever filled, and the one that was filled was by only 2 people. So that was annoying, since we were told 2 people can't sit in those, and clearly they had seated 2 people there right in front of us. We didn't know our waiters name, no introduction, had to ask for water, no desert menu offered, and had to ask for check. The food was good, as STK always is, but for the price we spent on food and cocktails, service should be way better than this.

Next I got their cowgirl steak, and it was a little burned on the bottom, and the taste was decent at best. I joked about getting some A1 steak sauce, but I was only half kidding.

The tuna tartare was clean & tasty as well! It's unfortunate my experience wasn't as pleasant due to the service. Not only was my steak temperature wrong but also my dessert order was wrong as well.  Although The server was nice enough to let me keep the other dessert & bought my order out. as well. Another issue was I requested to take the delicious garlic bread home instead of finishing at the table but the server never gave it to me and completely forgot. I also requested more of the sauce that came with it and again, was completely forgotten. The decor is beautiful & the DJ was very good!

1.0,7/28/2018,"STK Midtown is one of the worst restaurants I have EVER been to - total incompetence from hostesses to food preparation.  Seriously, all they need to do is take and honor reservations and cook the steak to temperature.  How hard can that be?STK Midtown features 45 minute wait times with reservations and of the the ~6 times that I have been to their various locations, they have cooked the steak properly MAYBE once the first time.  The bread with blue cheese is just plain nasty.STK has NEVER been great, and now it is full of downscale clientele that dont know any better.  Look at the reviews for yourself.  AVOID OR YOU WILL REGRET IT.  Never again.",0,0,0,Fiona S.,"New York, NY",0,5,0

Indoor and outdoor seating which I took advantage of on a nice day eating outside. The inside has some nice decor though, with the right touch of lighting and house DJ and full bar. Service was on point and attentive. Had a glass of Rose and Chadonnay during its social hour (their version of Happy Hour). Half price for any drink $17 or under. Order their little burger and truffle fries for starters. They weren't kidding when they say little as the burger was tiny but good, especially with the sauce they offer. The truffle fries were good...but only 4, eh, still worth it though. For those 4 they tasted great. Then had the 8 oz skirt steak which was prepared to close to perfection. Flavor, tender, juicy and good portion. I was definitely pleased with my meal. Everything came to a little over $60 which actually was around if not a little less than I expected to pay for all that I ordered.

3.0,7/7/2018,"STK was a classic Midtown steakhouse. Overall it's definitely pretty pricey so would only default to coming here for a business meal as it's not as worth the price.We ordered the oysters and tuna tartare to split as an appetizer. The oysters were the highlight of the meal. They were plump, not briney at all, and flavorful. The sides accompanying them were perfect. The tuna tartare was pretty good. The fish was definitely fresh but they could have given more taro chips to eat with the tartare itself.I ordered the au jus sandwich which was the biggest let down of my meal. They pre-soaked the sandwich then wrapped it in wax paper so the bread got extremely soggy and the whole thing was falling apart. My favorite part of an au jus is dipping the crusty bread into the sauce for a flavorful bite but couldn't get through this sandwich as every time I touched it, clumps of bread were stuck to my hands.The service was decent, our waiter wasn't very flexible (ie. putting steak on the salad or tuna on the class STK salad, even when we offered to pay more). The salads were small compared to the size of a side that came with the sandwiches. The fries were crispy and thin which I enjoyed.",1,0,0,Dina K.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",359,88,203

4.0,6/27/2018,"I can understand why some may not love STK. It's a bit pricey and full of guys in suits, but if those things don't bother you, then I say GO FOR IT! We started with the Alaskan King Crab. It's a small plate (about 2x smallish pieces of king crab leg), but it was delicious. Meat was slightly sweet (in a good way), and when dipped in the mustard sauce it was divine. Very well balanced and refreshing. For entrees, our table had the Grilled Lobster Salad, the 10 oz Loin, and sides of the lobster mac & cheese, the parmesan fries, and the sweet corn pudding.Now let me tell you... That sweet corn pudding is what dreams are made of. It doesn't jump off the menu as the most optimal side, but honestly, this dish is a star. It's a little sweet, a little salty. The texture is very reminiscent of creamy, buttery grits with fresh corn kernels mixed right in. It's also served in a small cast iron pot, so the outer perimeter has a nice crispness to it. We also really liked the lobster mac, the lobster salad, and the loin steak (do note, I intentionally left the parmesan fries off of this list. It was too potato-y for our liking, but could be good if steak fries are your thing).The lobster mac was creamy and had big chunks of lobster mixed in. The lobster salad was refreshing and had a great mix of flavors and textures. I'll be honest, I'm not an avid salad-eater. Yes, it makes my insides feel better, but it's rarely my first choice. BUT I could eat this salad everyday. And that loin steak with truffle butter - we were very into this. If you get the corn pudding, I recommend adding a small dollop of it to each bite of your steak.TL;DR: A little expensive, but if you have a decent amount of $$$ to throw down, it's worth the experience. Don't skip the sweet corn pudding.",2,1,1,Alexis Y.,"Brooklyn, NY",213,33,21

Probably the best I've ever had. $22 for a half dozen. The steak was excellent as well. I loved my skirt steak with the Alaskan king crab Oscar. My date got the 10oz filet with the peppercorn. It was also excellent. The only thing I wasn't crazy about was their lobster Mac n cheese. I thought it was ok. Definitely needed more chunks of lobster. The service was top notch.

We ordered a porterhouse steak Medium Rare, it came out Well Done. It'd be a different story if they didn't cut the steak, but since they cut and plated it, they knew what they were serving and served it anyway.  When we pointed it out, they agreed it was unacceptable and brought out a new one in 5 minutes that was grey on the outside and blue inside. Again, if they didn't cut and plate the steak, it would be a different story, but they knew what they were serving and served it anyway.  When we pointed it out, they agreed it was unacceptable.

Sides were Mac and cheese (everyone loved them) mushrooms and creamed spinach were all tasty. Steaks were cooked to perfection. I also enjoyed the selection of steak sauces. Most steakhouses turn their noses up to the thought of steak sauce. Here you are encouraged to try some out. The only negatives were the price and our server could have been a little more attentive.

1.0,5/21/2018,"Couple weeks ago I organized my husband's birthday and we were 9people. We all were very excited to have a nice night with great food and impeccable service as what STK is known for (at least what we thought). I organized the night with their event planner and we got a special menu, which is perfect for large parties.When the server arrived, he wasn't very cheerful and he seamed kind of annoyed or not in the mood... he showed up with the bottles and rudely asked what we are going to drink. Some people chose wine/ beer or prosseccos. The server started poring prossecco to a large glass of wine, one of my guest requested for a champagne flute, and there server rudely replied that prossecco is served in a wine glass. I think the staff needs to be a little bit more educated. Yes, maybe this type of wine usually is served not in a champagne flute, but in a special glass, which is a tulip shape, but never in a large open wine glass, because the aroma and the bubbles escape quickly. However, I had a feeling the server wanted to save his work serving us drinks and pour as much as he can and come serve us as less as possible. Once my guest insisted for a flute, the server's reply was- I don't have 12 flutes and angrily walked away. I'm sorry, but I wasn't aware STK is not well equipped with any restaurant's necessities. And after all, the restaurant seamed not that busy on the night. He came back maybe 7-10min later, even in worst mood... with the flutes, and pour prosseccos to some of the people and disappeared again. We were waiting for him for some time before we could start the evening with a birthday cheers for my husband. Finally, when we were ready to order, I asked him to ask our guests what would they like for the mains and he rudely replied to me no need to ask because it's a family style. I said- oh I was not aware of it. He rudely replied to me again- you signed the contract you should know. I'm sorry, but really.... that's the service I'm getting?!?! The treatment from a facilities that I'm a customer... saying the truth, I wasn't aware about family style and I looked over and over again on ""my contract"" and still hasn't seen that. At the the end of the day, it worked out well the family style, and it's not a bad way of doing it, but since I wasn't aware of it and the rude reply from the server- it made me very sad and very upset at the same time. He just had to tell me in a nice manner that usually everything is served in a family style, and we would be just fine. We are very chilled and cool people. We want to have fun, enjoy and make everyone happy around us. We go out to nice places and we know what to expect. But this is not acceptable. The food was delicious! But the service- awful- from the begging to the end. Our deserts were served on a dirty table, my friend's cookie was placed on a piece of lettuce... it's not a pub or a fast food restaurant. I didn't know that STK standards fell so low.And the worst part of the night- the next day when I texted all my guests for attending the night, everyone replied- the night was great, but they all wished our server was nicer. Too bad! Not coming back there again! My office is right around the corner and I thought it can be a great place to bring my customers, but it would be an embarrassment.

The food, the service, the plating the ambiance..everything was simply magnificent!!We started off with bread and a short rib ravioli appetizer ( a little slighted with the amount of ravioli) the meat was delicious, almost had a sweetness to it but it was great-- i just wish it was a little more in the plate for the price. For our main dish i got AND TOTALLY recommend--  a Loin Steak with Alaskan King Crab topping, chimmy churry sauce and asparagus. The steak was seasoned so well my mouth waters from just thinking about it! it was so filling i had to take the rest home!  My husband got something similar- a sirloin steak with Alaskan crab ""Oscar"" i didn't try it for my self but he agrees a really great choice! To end our wonderful night we had coffee and Sticky toffee pudding - i first thought because of the name it was going to be a pudding like plate  but it had a cake and ice cream on top of it ( pictures listed below) im so glad it didn't come out the way i thought-- it was way better then we expected!

5.0,5/3/2018,"Never ever a complaint here. As I get older, I'm starting to love this location more than the downtown location. The downtown location is nice because they have a rooftop but it often feels over crowded. The midtown location is always spacious even when it's packed. I come here strictly for the Mac and Cheese. I love how they serve it in a Staub dish which, I believe, allows the flavors to saturate the macaronis. My second favorite dish here is the parmesan truffle fries and the mini burgers. All three of those dishes together make a perfect dinner for me (maybe add a salad or something  so you don't feel guilty). Everytime I come I have to ask the waiter not to judge me for ordering 2 or 3 Mac and Cheeses, it's that good. I crave it. I dream about it.

2.0,4/29/2018,"The STK in Las Vegas is one of my favorite restaurants.  So, when we were deciding on places to have dinner in NYC, there was no question.  I wish I would've read some of the reviews before choosing. We made our reservation for 5:00pm on Thursday.  This gave us plenty of time to enjoy our dinner before the show we were going to attend or so we thought... definitely was not the case. We arrived on time but much to our surprise our table wasn't ready.  The hostess said it would be a few minutes & the other girl at the front started running around rampant.  At 5:15pm we still hadn't been seated.  The hostess called a manager for assistance but no one responded.  She ended up sitting us herself.  By this point, it was almost 5:30pm & we felt as if we were going to have to rush through dinner.  This was super disappointing as we had no time to order appetizers.  The waiter came & took drinks orders right away.  When the drinks arrived, he took our orders.  Our entrees arrived fairly quickly but there were issues.  We ordered Mac & Cheese & Corn Pudding and were provided forks to serve each with.  When I told the waiter, he found nothing wrong with it & said he would ""try"" to find spoons. I don't understand how he thought it possible to serve either side using forks. He ended up bringing back spoons but paid no attention to the fact that we could've used another round of drinks & more water.  Needless to say, our experience kinda sucked.  I expected better from a restaurant with such a great reputation. I guess that standard only applies to the Vegas location.  The only good things were the hostess who did a job that wasn't hers & my steak being cooked right.  Other than that... nothing.  When I'm in New York again I definitely won't be going back here.  I wish I would've read some of the reviews before choosing.",0,1,0,Andrea D.,"Las Vegas, NV",95,7,0

All were very good. My husband ordered ceasar salad, porterhouse steak and garlic broccoli. His salad was very small, his steak ordinary and the broccoli was definitely not good. We voiced our opinion of the broccoli to the manager thinking she might take it off the bill but she only said she would tell the chef. The worst part is that yesterday my husband spent the day sick as a dog, from what we have to assume was food poisoning, might be the recent lettuce recall or the egg recall.

We split the bill per person and the server charged me for the entire bill on top of charging everyone's cards for their individual totals AND taking the cash. When this was brought up, a manager came over and instead of offering me anything for the major inconvenience and ""mistake"", she came with her business card and said I could contact her if I have any questions. All I was offered was a voucher for a free bottle of prosecco at my next meal. I informed her that I WOULD NOT be coming back and I would like the bottle as I leave. (Thank you for offering me the cheapest & most available bottle - not a grand gesture). She kept saying she didn't understand what I was asking for or what I wanted. I kept saying that I wanted to know what could be done for the inconvenience of CHARGING ME $700! I was very displeased that nothing was offered to me until I brought it up. I am not interested in a free drink or dessert - as I clearly am trying to leave by paying my bill. And a free menu item is something that Applebee's does, and I expected much more from an establishment of this caliber.

2.0,4/13/2018,"Three of my girlfriends and I came here for a birthday dinner on Thursday night.Food/ Drinks: 2/5We ordered a bottle of Tempranillo for three of us and one ordered glasses of Pinot Grigio... no complaints here other than the fact that it took way too long for the drinks to come out. Also the dishes provided were super oily...Baby Gem Caesar Salad- 3/5Pretty standard Caesar salad. I liked how the lettuce was crispy though it was slightly heavy on the dressing.Grilled Octopus- 4/5A surprise treat, the octopus was very tender and had a lovely subtle taste. It was also accompanied by crispy bits of pork belly which was a nice salty complement along with the pickled onions.Porterhouse- 1/5This is such a sad excuse for steak- I have literally had better meat at chain restaurants. We ordered this to share but the steak was extremely rubbery and fatty. We could not believe how shockingly stringy and tough the meat was. We got the chimichurri sauce and STK sauce- the chimichurri was ok but the STK tasted like glorified BBQ sauce. Sea Bass- 3/5This dish was a nice palate cleanser, the fish was flaky and well cooked. Nothing too special but a welcome reprieve from the steak.Side of Mushrooms- 4/5This was pretty delicious! Fresh mushrooms with a deep umami taste, seasoned perfectly with salt and pepper.Chocolate Cookie & Ice Cream- 3/5 Pretty decent dessert! The cookie was super sweet and chocolatey, melted into the iron pan. With the melting vanilla ice cream on top, each bite was pretty yummy. Ambience: 2/5The decor is chic and beautiful- this is definitely a swanky place to see and be seen. However it is super loud that you can barely hear your fellow diners and the service is abysmal. Starting from the rude hostess- yes it was busy in the bar area but honestly, the seated table section is quite small and should not be so hard to manage. We had a reservation for four at 7:30PM. The hostess said they were waiting for a table to clear and it'll only be a few minutes, pointing to a group of guys in the corner. Although, a few tables away was a blatantly empty table for four. We asked if we could be seated there and she said no we will get you seated soon once the current table pays their tab. It is now 8:00PM- the guys in the corner are still there and the empty table for four still there. We ask again, hello when will we be seated? The reservation was for 7:30PM and it is now past 8... they finally seat us AT THE EMPTY TABLE THAT HAD BEEN EMPTY FOR THE PAST 30 MINUTES with no explanation.Our waitress was fine and helpful whenever she was at the table. Though again, the dining area is so small we couldn't understand how it was so hard to find a waiter throughout dinner.I would never come back here- there are plenty of steakhouses around that will provide much better service and much better quality food, especially at these prices!",2,0,0,Jinny C.,"Queens, Queens, NY",1,49,290

The main issue we had was with the server. For being a fine dining restaurant and having customers going in there having certain expectations she looked like she had just woken up. Not presentable at all, to say the least. We right away ordered drinks and told her we were also ready to order dinner. Her response was that she would be right back after putting down some menus that she was holding in her hand. I then see her walking around, checking on other tables (which is fine) but then I also see her going over to the bar and chatting up with her coworkers like she completely forgot about us. After about 15 mins she finally came back to our table with our drinks and took our food order. Shortly after that, we received our appetizers and that is when she asked us if we wanted another drink. Both of our drinks were at least half full or even fuller!!!! She was not even paying attention to us, just trying to up-sell. We then later got our food and she then again was trying to up-sell us on extras when we already ordered more than enough food for 2 people! Absolutely absurd! We came in here thinking we would be dining in a fine dining restaurant and what we experienced was having a unpresentable server who only wanted to up-sell us.

3.0,4/8/2018,"So I came here to celebrate my birthday, I've visited a lot of steak houses in the past and wanted to check out STK. I had a reservation  on a Saturday for 10pm. Kind of a late dinner but I had brunch and a show prior, so yeah it was at the perfect time for me!!The hostess was very warm and inviting, we were a bit early, but didn't have to wait long for our table. As we waited there were so many different smells going around and lots of bread. I was hungry!!We finally got seated, and our waiter Justin dived right into the specials, lots of seafood which I am allergic to and I stated that to our waiter Justin. So we ordered our food and beverages and everything came out perfect. BUT we didn't get our BREAD. The bread looked so good with a green dipping butter being passed around everyone's table except ours. I was wondering if the bread was complimentary because the way it was coming out of the kitchen I don't believe EVERYONE ordered it. So we asked a random server(because our waiter was never around) was the bread complimentary and he looked confused and ask if we received any bread. By now we're on dessert. So he  asked our waiter Justin to give us bread to go, and Justin had a little attitude. Why I don't know, it's not like he had to go and make it himself.He than bought the bread in a to go box WITHOUT the dipping sauce. So now we ask our waiter Justin can we have the dipping sauce as well he paused and gave us a real not so pleasant look on his face said ok and  walked away. We were shocked like did we miss something? Like why was he rude like that? My partner bought t me to this restaurant for my birthday to have the whole STK experience and unfortunately it was not the full experience. We shouldn't have to beg for something that is suppose to be complimentary. Oh I did taste the bread the next day and it was delicious. I can only imagine if I ate it when I was hungry, in the restaurant when it was fresh and  hot. The food was GREAT. the sirloin, Mac and cheese, and creamed spinach. We did have a glass of bubbly at the beginning, and ordered a cocktail during our meal, but we got the cocktails for dessert because Justin forgot them.

We asked for the other 2 sauces thinking they made a mistake but the waitress and manager said that's the chefs version of those. Ew.

The drinks were very good but I didn't get to try the steak  until my friends birthday. Hoooooolyyyyy shhhhhh... Yeah, I snacked down on this thing like it hurt my feelings in third grade and I can finally get my revenge. The red wine sauce made my life better if only for the night. Eating this steak was like making out with a smoking hot princess. Good job to you both, you deserve one another. The price is a Kings ransom but you will gladly pay (if you can afford rent that month). Love the cream corn and the brussel sprouts.

Long story short I was disappointed because the bar is the first stop in the restaurant and usually sets the tone for the rest of the experience. We couldn't find a manager either.

3.0,2/12/2018,"I ate here with my girlfriend the other night . We decided to try something new because we were celebrating a special occassion on this particular night. First off i want to say the ambience at this location is beautiful and very cozy. It is great for groups or couples. Our waitor was very nice when he was around but was inattentive to us for the most part and we had to bother other staff members to keep sending him over. No one seemed to have knowledge of pairing wines with my meal as i like medium body reds that are not dry as an after taste but they were very nice and gave me a few to try till i found the right one. When it came time to order entrees our waitor didnt write anything down ( which is ok but you better make dam sure the order comes out perfect ) and we both ordered steak entrees to be cooked medium. when our entrees came mine was a little overcooked  but my girlfriends came completly rare and almost looked seared. It took a while to get a hold of waitor to get it cooked a little more and i wound up eatting by myself and so did my girlfriend because it took a while to get back. Eatting by yourself isnt fun when your out to have a good time and celebrate. This would never happen at Ruth Chris or Blackstones.... just saying. But when the entrees were corrected they were delicious and the truffle fries were good. We ordered the STK ICE for dessert and when it came the presentation was so beautiful that ofcourse we had to take a picture. It came with 3 mini icecream cones with each a different flavor on a custom stand. UNFORTUNATELY i am a firm believer in what looks good doesnt taste good as good. This theory never disappoints. As soon as i tasted the cone I could tell these cones were pre-scrooped and stored in the wrong freezer because it tasted like complete FREEZER BURN. Dont be cheap when you charge a premium and invest in an ice cream freezer especially if you have a pastry chef. The proper holding/serving temperature for icecream is 10 degrees. What a turn off this was because no meal is ever complete in my eyes without something sweet at the end. Overall I think this place is worth a chance. A place like this comes with a premium for service, freshness and status. That was something that was lacking this night and experience.",0,0,0,Raff B.,"Commack, NY",123,9,2

I was really caught off guard by this since I was under the impression that this was a high end restaurant. I was still hopeful and I followed through with my reservation although I had a gut feeling to make a new reservation elsewhere. My boyfriend and I arrived and went to to the front desk where we were greeted by someone that seemed really impatient also which made me think that this may have been the person on the phone call earlier. She was impatient and unprofessional. We waited to the side to be called. When we got down to the back where our table was, our table was not clean or ready. We had to wait for someone to do so. Once we sat down, we were greeted by our server who spoke extremely fast like we were being rushed, to the point that I couldn't understand a thing she was saying. I kept having to ask her to repeat her self. Between her fast speaking and the music being loud, things were off to a bad start. To start our order, they brought us out water and when I went to drink it, the glass smelled really weird, in a bad way. Both glasses smelled the same way. I was completely turned off at this point. We then started looking through the menu when we realized that their prices did not match the service we had received. Don't get me wrong, I don't mind paying a hefty price for food if 1. The food is good and 2. The service is exceptional. To be quite honest, I've been treated better at a franchise restaurant. We decided on this moment that this wasn't a experience that we wanted to continue and we left. Our date night that we had been looking forward to had been cut short abruptly.

The meatpacking district was fully booked so we decided to come to the midtown location. From the minute we walked in saw a huge difference between the quality of service. The server came over, asked us for drinks and then our drinks were finished and then decided to take the order. The server did not even have specials, which on a Saturday night seems kind of surprising. He also never checked in to see how our meal was. The food was very good but still overall disappointed with the lack of hospitality.

However, it was basically deserted lol. Keep in mind this was a Tuesday lunch at around 3 PM so I can say I was surprised. The lunch prix fixe menu was $42 which is reasonable considering how nice the place is so we ordered off that. The tuna tartare app is solid. The right amount of everything and I would definitely go back there if the steak was good but unfortunately for me it fell flat. The steak frites done medium was way too chewy and it lacked any real flavor. I had to coat each bite with a green sauce they gave to even finish it. The portion was fine for the steak but my friend's tuna tartare was ridiculously small. Basically 5 pieces/bites of tuna and an average salad with it. I know we are ordering off the lunch prix fixe menu but still, 5 bites of tuna is no ones dinner in my book. The dessert said desserts to go but I don't remember receiving or was offered anything...maybe I misread. Not sure.

The short rib raviolis were also very good, but there were seriously only TWO small ravioli in $26 dish! That ended up costing $15 PER RAVIOLI!

1.0,1/27/2018,"The food is excellent, but the service is atrocious. There are plenty of venues nearby where, for the same price, you can get food that is as good or better and you won't have to deal with horrid service. I've been visited by waitstaff more at a Chick-fil-A than I was at this establishment. I will never return to this restaurant.We made a reservation, arrived on time, and then proceeded to wait for 45 minutes for a table. Our water glasses were empty for nearly the entire meal as the staff took unacceptably long to refill them. We had been seated for more than twenty minutes before we saw a waiter for the first time, and it was another fifteen minutes before bread was brought to the table.The music was so loud we had to shout at each other to be heard. I understand that there is a bar/lounge adjacent to restaurant seating, but the result of the arrangement is to make the experience akin to dining next to a DJ booth, and as a consequence, wholly unpleasant. The tables are far too close together and thus our already strained voices had to compete with the intolerably annoying diners seated less than one foot away from us. This may have been an aberration from the norm, but the other clientele were pretentious and rude - what I'd expect to find in college at a party hosted by a fraternity of ill repute. The unacceptably loud music blended with shouts about a ""$19,000 pay raise,"" a list of all the Michelin Star restaurants the diners next to us had ever visited in a trivial and smug contest that would have been amusing if it had not been conducted at 120 decibels (probably so the rest of the restaurant could also hear), a similarly ludicrous exchange about every famous person they had ever been in a room with,  and how one of the women, newly pregnant (and very persistent that her steak be cooked through but seemingly unconcerned about fetal alcohol syndrome), could leverage her pregnancy to get seats for the rest of the group at a busy bar.This dining experience was more than disappointing, it was entirely unpleasant. This was the first and last STK I will visit. If you're considering a chain steakhouse, do yourself a favor and go to the incomparably superior Ocean Prime or the reliably excellent Mortons. Alternatively, try one of the many other steakhouses in midtown that overwhelmingly outperform this establishment. I don't think I'd return here if I was paid to.",2,1,0,Michael S.,"Washington, DC",203,1,0
1.0,1/26/2018,"I've previously visited this restaurant. I was very pleased with the service and my meals. But today it was different. The two hostess were trash talking about the customers as soon as you walk in. My son, A BLACK young man walked in wearing a hat. They asked him to take it off, he did. But when we looked around the room, there were about 10 white men wearing hats. My son put his hat back on because he's suffering from alopecia and of course he's feeling insecure.  The floor manager came to our table and told him he couldn't wear his hat. Several times. My son asked why everyone else was wearing hats. She again asked him to remove his hat. He then politely told her to go ask the 3 WHITE men across from us to remove their hats and he too would remove his, she DID NOT. IN FACT SHE NEVER APPROACHED THEM. THEY WERE NOT ASKED TO REMOVE THEIRS WHEN THEY WERE SEATED EITHER!! THANK YOU FOR RUINING MY BIRTHDAY YOU RACIST BITCH!!! Our server was wonderful. That's the only reason you're getting 1 star.

First, they didn't let us finish our appetizers and brought the steak without even asking and cleaning the table. Second, after I kindly reminded our server about my friend's Birthday, he brought some dessert before we even finished the steak. He literally threw something with a candle on the table on his way to another table without saying a word. I felt really bad and embarrassed in front of my friend that moment.

We had some salad and cocktails to start, and they were pretty good. Salad was super fresh and crispy, cocktails were strong and high quality. We ordered some side dishes to share, and we all ordered different kinds of steaks. The side dishes were great, and steaks were juicy, tender, and flavorful. We all enjoyed the food. So, why the 2-star review? Well, the service was horrible. And I mean HORRIBLE. For the first time, I received a really bad service here, which was very disappointing, especially when we were bringing guests with us... I remembered how great the service was before, when we were being taken care of by female server. The same could be said at the STK Orlando as well. But, this time, we had a male server and he had bad attitude, and was rather rude. He did not come check on us much at all, we had to constantly look for him or ask other staff to get him for us whenever we needed something. It made our experience here at STK Midtown a bit sour...

We ended up renting out the whole restaurant to accommodate for our large group and we ended up using every table in the space. We were able to have a photo booth with the large area near the front of the door and then kept the rest of the front space open for the happy hour portion of the lunch before we sat down at our tables to eat. The section of the room was large enough for our 130 guests to easily maneuver around the bar area to talk to others. Lunch was a set menu with starter options of shrimp cocktail or caesar salad. Entree options included a 10 oz. filet, chicken, or a vegetarian option of mushroom risoto. For such a large group, I heard very few complaints from those who ordered the steak about being served the wrong temperature meat. Kudos to the chef for being able to keep all of those straight! We finished the day with passed desserts of strawberry cheesecake and caramel brownies. All in all, everything was delicious and it is quite clear that the management group here is seasoned when it comes to hosting large events.

After we told the hostess we had a senior citizen in our reservation, we were sat DIRECTLY in front of the DJ. Hostess was very rude to us when we were seated as well. The general manager avoided us after asking a few times to talk to him. There were a number of drunk customers who were dancing right in the middle of the dining area.

So I guess that's not an option.Again, I am not one to leave reviews - it takes a lot for me to do it. But STK was a very rare (no pun intended) exception.

Given the vibe and what I believe your intent to be as an establishment, I'm going with a 2 star review. We started by standing at a round, high top table at the back bar - totally fine. We then ordered a round of drinks - martini glasses were nowhere to be found, so we had alternate glasses - also fine. A seat opened at the bar, so we stepped up and ordered another round. The overall vibe is a bit pretentious - and that's based mostly on the patrons. The staff is fine - Christina, (at the back bar), was cool. I'm okay with a pretentious vibe, as long as you play it right. We ordered ""lil"" sliders... which apparently came 2 to an order, but, I also saw an order going to a table with 3 sliders, (totes confused). If you don't have a calculator handy, I'll do the math - that's $11 per cold slider. That's right, folks... the two cold sliders that we received were $11 each. And the flavor was bland - definitely nothing to write home about.Kind of bummed that our tab, (not including tip), for 4 average cocktails and an order of x2 (cold) sliders came to $98.",5,0,1,Tara C.,"Brooklyn, NY",150,138,152

The parking situation is extremely tough, they are location in midtown Manhattan.  With that said, there are many public transportation options available.  The only negative was that is was noisy and I had trouble hearing everyone at the table, which is not good when you are trying to conduct business.  Overall, I would recommend this place to others.  Happy Yelping :)  Very nice place, pricy,  loud.",13,9,14,Joey A.,"Brooklyn, NY",455,134,649

I'd say any time after 7 on a weekend it is fully booked. If we go before then, there's a decent crowd but not crazy packed.The pull apart bread with blue cheese butter and some sort of green oil (maybe chives?) is actually to die for. I dream about it. So delicious!I always get the filet and add on truffle butter for $10. Red wine sauce pairs perfectly, IMO.For sides, my go to is the mac and cheese. I have also tried the mashed potatoes, spinach, and brussel sprouts. All are good and a decent size portion to share btwn 2-3 people. If you get asparagus, they give you a ton but I found it to be too lemon-y for my liking. I've tried to truffle fries but they weren't anything to really brag about. Good but not to the point that I'd have to order them again.The place is pricey- a glass of wine will run you upwards of $15 and the specialty cocktails are closer to $17+. We usually end up spending around $100 pp when all is said and done which I guess is average for a) a steak dinner and b) a midtown restaurant but just be prepared to spend a pretty penny.On weekends, the have a DJ in the evening so if youre looking for a quiet dinner, this isn't the place.All in all, I would recommend.

2.0,10/22/2017,"Please note that is not for all STK's in Manhattan.  My partner and I LOVED the STK in Meatpacking.  Even after 4 years, him and I still talk about that experience- food, service and ambiance, everything was excellent.  Then the STK in Midtown ruined the STK name for me. For a bachlorette dinner, a few girls were super excited to go to STK.  The bridal party had made reservations through a friend and we were told we would be taken care of.  Our reservation was at 8:30pm, I got there at 8:15pm and waited for the rest of the girls.  8 out of the 9 girls got there exactly at 830pm.  When we checked in, apparently we were told that we were not allowed to be seated until our entire party- which I would understand if we were missing half.  But this is ONE person and this was a for special occasion.  Fine, so we waited outside and the last person arrived at 8:45pm.  One of the girls went back in to tell the hostess and we were told we had to wait.  We didn't get seated until 9:30-945pm!  Apparently there was another group that was on our table for 3 hours and didn't want to move.  What a lame excuse. Anyway, we finally got seated, and this is when the horrible experience continues... - Server never greeted us with a kind smile or even with a name.  They handed out the menu (btw, for 9 girls, we only got ONE drink menu).  \- We had to wait about 20 to put in our drink order. The bride ordered all the starters for the table.  And after quite sometime we ordered the entrees. - The starters were delicious, that was definitely the best part when we finally got to eat after a long wait to get seated.  - After the drinks came out, the server NEVER asked how our drinks were.  Yes, granted only 4 out of the 9 girls ordered drinks but still.  Apparently, when we made the reservation, we were told that we were going to receive a round of champagne for the table. Instead the server said, instead of giving a round of champagne to everyone on the table because only 4 girls ordered drinks, he puts in the same drinks for the four girls, leaving the rest of the girls just with water glasses.  First of all, if the restaurant planned on changing from the round of champagne to just giving the girls who ordered drinks, then at least ask if the drinks they ordered before was good.  A couple girls hated their drinks and regret ordering it.  They didn't even drink the second round because they HATED the first round. - We were chatting and trying to enjoy our starters, there were still food on the plates when a bus-man decides to quickly removing ALL the plates.  With food still on the plates!  He didn't ask whether we were done with it or not.  He moved so fast to remove the plates, we literally had to grab the plate back and tell him we're still working on it. One of the girls literally still had her fork in her hand and the man tried to take her plate away.  ASK first!  And same goes for entrees!  Almost all the sides and everyone still had food on the plates and 2 bus-men decide to quickly tried clear out the plates.  I still had HALF my filet on my plate and he takes it away, I had to pull it back and tell him I was still working on it.  He started to take the sides, and literally three girls had to stop him.  He was clearing everything so fast, we lost some food because we couldn't tell him fast enough.  Honestly, we felt so bad for making reservations at this location.  The bride to be was trying to keep a happy face however we just felt horrible.  Out of all the choices of restaurants, the bride was so excited to go to STK.  We just made reservations for the wrong location.  Will never recommend STK Midtown to anyone.",1,0,1,Jennifer C.,"queens, NY",261,7,11

They also have a wonderful private dining rm where we hosted events for our clients. Last Thur I went there with a colleague and from the moment we entered the space my mood was ruined: the hostess was on her phone barely looking at those who walk in, I was the 1st one to say hello and distracted her from the phone. Then she told us because we were 10 min early (!) she needs to cancel our reservation - to which I jokingly asked if we should go for a quick walk and come back to satisfy her need for punctuality needs. She offered us to go to the bar  and have a drink. The bar was  packed with screaming after work crowd, so we politely refused. She warned us again that the reservation will be cancelled because we came in early. Ridiculous. Finally we were seated. We had tuna  tartar (mediocre), short-rib ravioli (delicious) and split a filet mignon (pretty good). Our waitress was very attentive and caring.

Right off the bat, the steaks did not look the same as they did last time.  It definitely did not seem like a delmonico cut.  We did not complain about it as we just don't like to send food back.  The bone marrow, however, was bloody.  I have had bone marrow before (at STK), but never had it dripped blood into the plate.  We had to send that back.  The manager came over to check on us and we just said it was a little bloody to our tastes.  He said he'll send another one out.  The next one came (much later) and a little better, but still it was under cooked.  We asked for the bill, hoping (not assuming) that they would do something about the bone marrow; they did... they charged us twice for it.  -_-  We had to send the check back as well..  I hope this was just an off-night as this was one of my favorite places for steak.",0,1,0,Nelson L.,"New York, NY",28,141,23

Water was filled up promptly whenever our cups became empty and she was always available when she was needed. Food was also brought out after a reasonable time. The 3 stars was for the food itself. I was expecting a lot more from a steakhouse with the standard of being in New York since its known to have delicious steak. My group ordered the porterhouse to share, mac and cheese, side of broccoli, and Beef tartare to start. Most disappointing was the porterhouse, which was ok but for the price you're paying it was definitely not worth it. It was ordered medium rare, very dry and tasteless, we got little to no flavor from it. I've ordered porterhouse at other steakhouse for the same price and got much better quality, which is why I was not happy with this one. Sides were also good but not great, and portion sizes were not filling enough. Beef tartare was good, no complaints with that.

If you care about the food quality and service quality, there are many many many better choices in New York City to get a great steak. Many. Did I say many?STK  delivered 2 of 5 of us medium-well steaks despite our order of super rare, so two of us asked for new steak.  This was a business dinner and I hate to ask for a new steak, but it's not like they were ""a little"" overcooked: they were incredibly overcooked. Not edible, and certainly not something you should suffer through for over $60 for a simple ribeye. It took them over 25 minutes to bring the new steaks out for the two of us, & at that point everybody else had eaten and dinner was preparing to wrap up so and we declined to eat 'em. Over the years I have eaten steak at virtually every good New York City steakhouse; Ben Benson's, the post house, Smith and Wollensky's, Peter Lugar's in Brooklyn, Del Frisco's, Keen's, Old Homestead - You name it, I've been there (even if my spelling is off).The steak served by STK to the  3 people at our table whose steak wasn't incorrectly cooked looked to be the kind of thing you would expect to get at a national chain restaurant. I don't know, maybe something Applebees serves.So - The place was rocking, & had a great DJ. If all you care about our appetizers, drinks, and ambience, it's probably worth checking out.

The hostess said, ""nope that's the design on the table"". It was dirty for sure!!!!

1.0,8/21/2017,"A delayed bus left my family and I without a lunch reservation on Friday afternoon in New York. Saw that there was a nearby STK with extended lunch hours so decided to head over. I ordered the Filet Medallion and a side of Sweet Corn Pudding.QualityAlthough I am often skeptical of chains, I have had nothing but good experiences at the two  STK locations in Miami. So at an odd hour and with no other plan in place, STK Midtown sounded like a good option. Unfortunately this particular location did not live up to the lofty expectations set by the other ones. Right from the start I was disappointed when I learned that there would not be blue cheese butter bread. I got two explanations, one that it was not served at lunch and another that it is only when the crowd is busy that they make it. The bread is such a signature item and was immediately what came to my head when I decided to go to STK, so needless to say it was a huge blow. But I figured once my steak came out everything would be fine again. That however turned out to be wrong. My Filet Medallion was overdone and so dry. I lathered it in blue cheese butter, but theres only so much a sauce can do for a bad steak. The Sweet Corn Pudding was fine as a side, but I came to the restaurant thinking about the bread and steak, and both were far below even average.QuantityThe Sweet Corn Pudding side was enough for two people to share. The Filet Medallion is definitely on the small size, but it was a good portion for lunch.ValueWhile in line with other steakhouses, STK is definitely an expensive meal. While they were running promotions for lunch and restaurant week, they did not really have steak options on those menus. I am perfectly fine paying the higher price for a high quality steak, but that was not what I was given. Also, if you are paying these prices, not providing bread feels wrong.AmbianceSTK Midtown is located in Manhattan very close to Bryant Park. It is a very busy area, but finding the restaurant is a bit tricky because of its location in the building. When you enter the space it is dimly lit, giving a sophisticated vibe. The front area of the restaurant has some seating, but is setup more as a lounge with a long bar. We were seated in the back area, which was arranged for lunch dining. They utilized a lot of couches, which clearly was not a big hit with many patrons requesting to sit at tables. The ceilings in the back area are very unique as they have a curved design with a black and white contrast. Much like the other locations you get the feel that it could easily be converted into a club with just a moments notice. The music was a mix of house tunes, which also seemed to fit the feel.CrowdThere were a good number of folks having lunch. It seemed like it would be a popular spot for a business lunch and most people were dressed up in suits. However, they seemed under staffed for the number of people dining, which definitely was an issue. It also seemed obvious that many people wanted to sit at tables, but despite multiple requests they refused to spread to that area.ServiceThe service at the Midtown STK is absolutely horrendous. The girl that was working at the front desk could not have been ruder if she tried. But she was still one-uped by our unbelievable pretentious waiter who managed to completely screw up one of our orders. He ended up bringing out a dish that was not even on the menu and then tried to argue that it was ordered. My mother was too nice to complain, but I immediately said that she did not order that, to which he defensively tried to argue that she did. He also proceeded to say it was a better dish than what she ordered anyway. Not wanting to have to wait even longer for a new item my mother chose to eat what had come out, but I was upset. I would have assumed that dish would at least be taken off the bill, but instead they gave us brownies. Now I though a dessert would be an elaborate dish, but these were little tiny cold brownies in plastic bags. I was ready to speak to a manager, but my parents did not want to get in a fight, so instead I left unsatisfied and angry.ParkingI cannot even begin to guess the best plan for parking in this very busy area of Manhattan. I assume garages and lots are available, although not in the immediate area.ExtraPoorly prepared food and horrendous service make STK Midtown a place to absolutely avoid. It is very sad to say this because I really have such good experiences at the Miami locations. But it really was the argumentative and standoffish attitudes of the staff that left me shocked. This is not a place to waste a moment of your time, and from reading other reviews it appears my experience with the service was far from an anomaly.",4,2,3,Ryan F.,"Forest Hills, Queens, NY",351,949,2069

The steak was good, but I would say not quite at the level of BLT or Benjamins.  Service was spotty - sometimes friendly but sometimes with attitude. They put blue cheese on top of the bread and we asked for one without cheese (due to lactose intolerance) and the waiter rolled his eyes and stalked off. It was restaurant week, but the waiter didn't mention it at all - we had to ask (we didn't end up going for a restaurant week dinner but would be nice to see the options rather than feeling like they were being hidden away).

The steak was good but i wasn't a fan of the""sides"". I had the dry ages T-bone steak with filet mignon. For the sides we went for the creamed spinach and truffle ""fries"". The fries were very large and I would call them potato cubes, they were very bland as was the creamed spinach. The service was not that great; our waiter was very dry and unfriendly/unenthusiastic. There is a manager that goes around to tables and makes awkward 'trying to be funny' conversations with patrons. I could've done without that.

We were starving and watched as other people sat down, ordered, ate and left. The server did not even provide bread until after the entree came out so we were extremely hungry. Ontop of that I had to ask for ketchup three times and the asparagus had a long black hair in it. I also had to point out the charge that remained on the bill by accident after the server told me he would absolutely be removing the side with the hair. They didn't waive anything on the bill even the asparagus hair until after I pointed it out and offered a round of drinks to make up for the terrible service which was a really poor offer considering we had no time as it was since the food came out so late and it was also 1:45pm on a Wednesday.

A wedge of iceberg lettuce with sliced cherry tomatoes, bacon and crumbled bleu cheese. I want more of it even now.16 ounce sirloin was certainly tender enough, VERY flavorful, and perfectly, evenly cooked throughout. Certainly on par with the better steak houses in Manhattan. jalapeño grits were good but I don't think I would order them a second time. Once was enough, but nothing here was close to bad.

4.0,5/30/2017,"I've had more steak in NYC than I expected because apparently it's important to all my overseas visitors to have steak in NYC. This place was bumping on a Thursday night when I came.The restaurant has three sections - the bar at the front, the lounge area in the middle and the dining area at the back. You can order from the same menu anywhere you sit but I recommend making a reservation if you want to get a table. The restaurant was pretty loud, I had to yell for my friend to hear me. We started off with some complimentary bread - pull apart bread with cilantro oil/ chive sauce. I can say that this was one of the best complimentary breads I've had. I'm still thinking about it now! The presentation was so cute, the bread was fluffy and warm, and the sauce was tasty. I knew immediately that everything else was going to be great. For our appetizers, we shared a Lil' Brgs and Grilled Spanish Octopus. The sliders were delicious. You can taste the quality of the wagyu beef but the special sauce didn't blow me away. The grilled octopus was fresh and tender. I really liked the capers, pepadews and Castlevatrano olives that went with the octopus. For our mains, we shared a Skirt Steak and a Rib eye. The skirt steak was on point, you could really see and taste the marbling of the fat. It was juicy and flavorful. The Rib eye was good but Del Frisco's was better. I definitely preferred the Skirt Steak between the two. We also got the wine sauce and au poivre sauce for the steaks. The steaks were great on their own but the sauces were nice too. My only complaint is that the skirt steak was quite small so a medium rare came out closer to a medium for us. For sides, we got the Parmesan Truffle Fries. They were interestingly shaped like little rectangular wedges. I didn't usually love thick fries but I did with these. They were crispy but filling and flavorful in each bite. I couldn't stop eating them. Finally, for dessert we stuffed ourselves with the Sticky Toffee Pudding. The pudding was fluffy and caramely sweet, paired with some sweet cream ice cream. There was some crunch from the burnt sugar too. Loved it to end the night with.Personally, I liked the vibe of STK but I didn't think the loud music was appropriate for a proper steak dinner especially if you have to constantly yell for the other person to hear you, but overall great food and service.

The grilled octopus appetizer was also tasty and was enough for 2. In regards to the main course - aka steak - the menu is unique where you choose the size, topping and sides. The menu made the entrees sound more enticing than the actual product but it was still great - I mean, we went to a restaurant named ""STK"" afterall.This place is definitely not for anyone on a budget - its a splurge that was satisfying, but not anything wow-worthy.

When you coming back from Florida my friends had put together a dinner at their newest location in midtown . Fortunately I just came back to New York after going treatment for cancer and my hair was not up to par well up to my standards. I didn't get a chance to shave it so I throw on a hat. We entered the restaurant and we waited a few minutes while they're getting a table ready. We proceeded to the table and sat down received your menus. I security guards approach the table and requested that I remove my hair. I responded and he told me that it is not allowed in this establishment so I pointed to another table where the woman was wearing a fedora. He provided no explanation but stated if I don't move my house I would have to leave. I wasn't able to remove my hat hatch because I was missing patches of hair from chemo because I was battling cancer at the time. The security guard then escorted my party and I out from the restaurant! I was truly embarrassed and horrified of what they had done to me! People all around us were staring! I found this very troubling & I was horrified!!! Basically this establishment was pushing me for having cancer that's how I felt!,10,1,0,Elio V.,"Red Bank, NJ",1062,75,151
4.0,4/8/2017,"Holy cow.....the decor is really special, and so are the almond shaped booths they seat you in (whether you are a party of 2 people or 8).  The food; albeit pricey, is just delish.  Our favorites include Bone in Rib Eye with crabmeat on top, mashed potatoes, truffle fries (without the truffle oil) and the brussel sprouts.  Appetizers were pretty good, but 2 scallops for $22.00 or 2 sliders for same price in my opinion just wasn't worth it.  For dessert, the small  cones are so fun, and the apple crumb dessert was delicious.  Chocolate chip/ice cream was just okay.With this said, there are two very different takes on STK Midtown.  On a Saturday or Sunday at 5PM, STK is quiet, not at all busy (they are just opening) and you can hear each other speaking.  You can actually have a conversation. The servers are warm, yet professional and will take the time to explain menu items and even just talk for a few moments.  On a Saturday or Sunday or a week night after say.... 7:30, there is a DJ and the music is LOUD and just gets LOUDER AND LOUDER with each hour that passes making it all but impossible to have a conversation, .....and the waiters are in a hurry or just aren't able to talk because they can't hear you and you can't hear them. The music they play happens to be really great music; just way too L O U D!!!!!We had purchased gift cards for the holidays and had 'earned' quite a few gift cards to use.  Because of this, we met Travis, one of the managers at STK midtown.  He would sign off on these gift cards and would stop by our table to say hi and even emailed me to 'thank us' for coming in.  Very, very accommodating and very nice.  If you have the $$$ and you're looking for Special - Enjoy!!   STK Midtown offers special...but only if your going at an 'off' time.",0,0,0,Donna G.,"Bellmore, NY",56,19,3

The only thing that was excellent was the service. Our waiter was very quick and attentive. The food was the problem. The bernaise was disgusting - it tasted like tobasco sauce. We let the waiter know. He apologized and brought out an alternative sauce - peppercorn. That was also gross. It tasted like canned roast beef gravy with some fresh pepper. We ordered the bigeye tuna tartare, blue iceberg, filet, and lobster mac and cheese. I also ordered a drink - the raspberry fizz. The drink  was well made and delicious. Everything else was just bleh or worse. It's pretty much (bad) chain food quality now. Sad because the atmosphere is very nice.

It was a lovely gesture and really shows how much they care about customer service.  I'm sure it's never easy asking customers to move, especially at such an expensive restaurant, but I understand when you have people waiting.

For dinner my BFF & I both chose the sliced filet mignon, w a side of fries. There was fish & chicken also on the menu- but when your in STK, it's for the juicy, tender, and mouth watering steak! Dessert was good, but menu choices were a bit of a let down. Apple cobbler a la mode or a spread of three different Italian ice creams. I mean really- no chocolate choices?? We went for the baked apple. It was good, but chocolate anything would have been better. Restaurant Week dinner was priced at $42, not including tax & tip & drinks.

So horrible . Thank god my bestie who is from Switzerland also speak French and is a well established business man demanded to see the manager immediately. Young gentleman in his early 30's came to our table, really sweet French accent so my bestie started speaking French to him, and complained about the service, table etc. We then moved to a beautiful spacious table which usually seats five persons. I think it was from there the night turned around hmm VIP service, the manager himself was at our service. I must say the food was  great I had steak  the wine list is   not really top selections and the few on the list most they didn't have. But for me once I have few glasses of champagne am like whatever,I said what the heck. We did get a really good bottle of red wine after a few sorry we don't have that at the moment over all I would say for the young hip dont really care about wine list and service yes nice place for dinner  but if you are someone of class, wants great service, top wine list and attentive server please this is not that place.

3.0,2/7/2017,"Came here as a group of 4 to check out their restaurant week menu. Check-in was interesting, given the fact that our table wasn't ready by our reservation time, told to wait in the lounge area by the hostess, then scolded by the waitress for sitting in her lounge when it was for ""people ordering drinks only"". We were seated approx 10 mins later. The dining space is stunning. It reminds me of the newly renovated oculus at the WTC. The booths with the extra large flower arrangements are also a very nice touch. Menus were brought out, all but the restaurant week menu which was confusing. We had to ask for it specifically.. I guess they weren't making it known that they were offering restaurant week? Anyways we go to order, one item was already sold out from the restaurant week menu... and also ordered a few extra sides. Our dishes come out, except for the sides which we were told fell off the conveyer belt. Was 3/4 done with my steak before the sides came out. Restaurant week menu: - steak was good,  but I've had better. The skinny cut fries was the real winner of the dish. - highly recommend the beef tartare - romaine lettuce salad also very good - skip the salmon dish, chicken dish was average, the spinach that comes with both is very very flavorful - desserts included sorbet and apple crumb cake with ice cream. Nothing special Non restaurant week items: - bread for the table - divine- Brussels sprouts with pork - skip. Not a whole lot of flavor and seemed like Brussels sprouts weren't cooked long enough. Hard to eat- truffle corn - GET THIS - max and cheese - GET THIS Don't come here for restaurant week.  Consider coming here only it's on someone else's dime. Otherwise not worth the price.

2.0,1/29/2017,This is a tough review and should easily be 5 stars but the TERRIBLE SERVICE needs to be called out here!1st- we arrived ontime for our reservation and were told our table would be ready in a minute or 2. We used that as an opportunity to grab drinks at the bar. We were 2 couples and out for my wifes bday so we were enjoying the bar and catching up with friends when realized we had been sitting over 30 mins. I RE-CHECKED in and it seems they gave our table away and basically took us out of the system for some reason. No problem table would take a few more minutes but we were in no rush. No apology.. just a smug attitude from the hostess with the white funky glasses. 2nd- after being seated near the door it took a server a good 20 mins to take our drink order. When he finally brings the drinks we notice the table is wobbly and the martinis are spilling over with every movement. After another 15minute wait the server finally comes back and says the table top is messed up and he will tell the hostess to move us. We eat our apps and finally another table opens up. Again no apology!3rd- we move to the table in the middle and apparently the servers or hostess didnt relay the message of whats going on so now we are sitting there with no server. They bring us more sparkling water(leave the other 2 bottles at the other table) and dissapear for 20mins again. We have no cocktails no food and once again no apology. I eventually grab what i think is our waiter and politely ask if we are going to receive any food or should we just leave? The manager comes out and offers no excuse just more attitude like somehow we are an inconvenience. The food eventually comes and this us why the place got any stars at all. The food was excellent! All meals cooked perfectly!While waiting for UBER we actually met the chef outside and told him of what happened. He the 1 person who did his job correctly offered apologies and he was very nice. We complimented his food and told him he was talented.The real dissapointment was they didnt even offer a round of drinks or a dessert or an apology. Just the attitude of hey its STK so deal with it!

2.0,1/10/2017,So this was a review for awhile ago. and I definitely have not gone back since. STK is not longer in my recommended for places to go. The quality of food has gone down significantly. I ordered a 32 oz porterhouse for lunch. there were about 6 tables total The Porterhosue was overcooked with little to no sear. Normally I would have asked for it to have been taken back and then explained what was wrong with the dish. But simply put... I did not have time. It was a lunch break. It already took an hour for the porterhouse to come out. I didn't have time for another one to come out. So I jut ate it. The creamed spinach.. Hmm not as flavorful as I remembered. Apparently they no longer give bread (the best thing there anymore apparently) but they did make an exception I guess after hearing me complain a bit how we weren't being service quickly. This is lunch service in Midtown NY. you're expected good food and quick service. I ordered a $100 32 oz porterhouse with creamed spinach for 2 at lunch.

The white walls were splattered with a red looking substance. The cocktails made were mediocre. I've never had a margarita made with soda water until STK and it was awful. When we were seated they gave us one dinner and one lunch menu. Waited a while for a greeting and to take our order. Ordered two filets, Mac and cheese and cream spinach. The filet came out the wrong temp and too rare for our liking. The server never checked back so we just ate the parts of the filet that were the correct temp. The creamed spinach came out when we were finished with our meal, tried it anyway and it had too much nutmeg and the spinach was gritty. They offered to comp it due to the poor timing.

Located a few blocks away from our hotel and steps away from Bryant Park, it's easily accessible no matter where you stay in Times Square. The DJ was already bumping some tunes when we arrived at 7 pm with a mix of 80s and early 2000 dance music. It felt like a small tribute to George Michael and then mixing in some Madonna. The restaurant was already packed and got even busier as the night went on. The music slowly increases in volume as the night wears on giving you a great club dinner vibe. Service was outstanding, our server was very attentive, gave great recommendations and checked on us just enough to not be overwhelming. The food is some of the best I've ever had, the filet with truffle butter topping is mouth watering, I savored every bite! The sea bass was cooked perfect with just enough crispness.

3.0,12/19/2016,"Perfect description: Overrated. My boyfriend and I love steakhouses. Always looking to try a new one. STK was very expensive. Willing to pay the expensive prices, it wasn't worth it.Frigid cold try sat us right by the entrance of the front door, after walking through the restaurant to the restroom I was disappointed bc the middleOf the restaurant is completely different, great ambience and scene. We were seated at the front door, felt the 20 degree breeze. Front seating was awful.Next was the service. The waitress was very sweet but she was no where to be found. We had employ glasses sitting in front of us and would have probably spent another 50-60$ on drinks if she stopped by more often.The salad- we ordered a $17 wedge salad that was SMALL. The portions on everything were SMALL, actually pathetic. I truly was shocked at the portions. The table next to us orders a petite filet and even their expression next to us was almost shock. Again, I order the filet everywhere I go so I know sizes. This place was a rip.Most important- the steak. It was OK. Steakhouses are our thing and I mean it the food was just OK. It was slightly undercooked for Medium-Rare and it always wasn't the best cut of meat. I've had better at many other steakhouses for less money and/or the same price. This was my second time at STK and my opinion was the same the first time. I hoped for a better experience this time but there is no point when there are phenomenal steakhouses around for the same money.

4.0,12/19/2016,"If you happen to be at STK Midtown, I would assume one of three scenarios:1. You're on someone else's expense account, possibly traveling for business.2. You're trying to impress a (possibly soon-to-be) significant other.3. You and I live in different worlds.With that being said, however, STK should cover you in a handful of scenarios, as long as price is not a constraint. The venue is ideally located in Midtown Manhattan, just a few steps away from Bryant Park, and boasts a modern bar/lounge area and an impressive dining room, complete with comfortable booths and expansive tables; you won't find the typical two-seater here.Should you arrive for dinner, there's a number of selections across their menu, which has elements of your typical modern ""American"" cuisine, with hints of a Pan-Asian influence, as well as a dishes that are more commonly found in your traditional steakhouse. It's certainly not the most uniform menu, but the variety is certainly appreciated, and will ensure that diners can find something to their tastes. I would recommend starting with their Tuna Tartare, which comes elegantly presented in a two-layer cylinder; the bottom features a creamy avocado base, while the tartare is plated on top and served with taro chips. It's a light, yet balanced bite that plays the texture of the components against the sweet-savory flavors in the soy-honey emulsion. As scallops are one of my weaknesses, I couldn't avoid trying the Seared Scallops as well, which were perfectly seared and tender in the center, and were smartly paired with a creamy cauliflower puree and topped with braised red onions.I've had duck in numerous instances and forms over the years, and I can say that STK does this protein justice. The Spiced Duck Breast is served with two pieces of the protein cooked to a medium rare with a crisp, well-seasoned skin. It's paired with a tart red cabbage slaw and an apricot pistachio chutney, and the sweetness and nuttiness of the sauce highlights the best of the duck. The Glazed Beef Short Rib is nothing to scoff at either, as I appreciated the tenderness of the beef and the red wine notes evident in the sauce, but I definitely have to give a nod to the duck - especially as I can remember that dish months later.As for dessert, the Orange Dream Cheesecake might sound better suited on a kids menu, but I can assure you that it's not the case. Imagine a modern cheesecake, served in a multi-layered cylinder, topped with whipped cream and bruleed oranges. It's a perfect balance of sweetness and acidity, and manages to be rich and indulgent without being heavy and dense.As a whole, I have to admit that I was impressed with STK. The dishes, while definitely being at the higher end of the price spectrum, are well conceived and executed, and the ambiance is treads the definition of ""modern elegance"" surprisingly well. Should you get the opportunity to make a visit here - don't hesitate on it.",17,10,10,Lori L.,"New York, NY",2244,608,6827
1.0,12/18/2016,"I've been here many times, unfortunately tonight was a disaster. The entire restaurant is freezing cold, even the waitstaff and ""management"" agree and mentioned that they too are cold and have gotten a cold. So uncomfortable.

The food which is usually very good, arrived cold,  all in all it was a horrible dinner. Management couldn't do anything the temperature or the cold food.

4.0,12/14/2016,Went here for my boyfriends birthday. I have to say it's a little expensive but the steak was good and the sides were small but also tasty. I liked how there was dim lighting and a dj playing music to put people in the mood. The dessert was over priced and there was 6 of us and they brought out 4 ice cream cones which was pretty stupid. It's a trendy place so I brushed it off. I had a good night and I went there once more after that experience.,0,0,0,Lolita L.,"Brooklyn, NY",402,212,97
5.0,12/14/2016,"Let me start off with the ambience and the interior design of Stk. I'm a big fan of contemporary, open concept design and stk is just that. The high ceiling and the open design makes you feel as if you're entering into a grand place. I'm a big fan of the energy the place gives off. Also, the floral arrangement is wonderful! Next comes the food. Be prepared to pay a bit, but it's worth it. My friend and I started off with a few drinks. He got the cucumber stiletto and I got the strawberry cobbler both of which were great choices. The complementary bread with blue cheese and sauce was an excellent start to the food adventure we were about to commence. For those that don't like blue cheese, it is a very subtle taste you'd barely know it was there. Give it a try! We also ordered the lil' brgs and the toppings were wonderfully paired with the tender beef. We both ordered the filet medallions, I got rare with red wine sauce and he got medium rare with bearnaise. We got the truffle fries with Parmesan to share. The meat was very tender and we made sure to savor every bite.

Food was solid.  We had a variety of steaks, salads and sides, which everyone was pleased with.  Service was good.  The waiter made sure that he noted that the sprouts had pork in them, which was important to one of our party, so points there.When places are priced like this you generally get something special from the chef, like palate cleansers or small bites, which it seems like they would be totally capable of doing, but don't.

We were with a group of 6 and 4 of us sat in the bar area for drinks. I asked if the red italian blend was fruity and if it was more full or medium bodied and got a ""yeah"" for a response. They don't seat incomplete parties, which is understandable but then once all 6 of us were there, they still would not seat us until we settled our bar tab. It would have been much nicer had they transferred our drinks (like any good restaurant does) OR at least give us some warning that we'd need to settle up instead of us waiting to flag down the waiter to bring us our bill.

The restaurant is beautiful they have a DJ there after 5 I believe, and it's a lot of people that come in there right after work,  from the hustle and bustle of Midtown and it makes the place buzzing. I had a reservation, but yet when I got there they didn't have my table ready, which was an inconvenience, but I just went directly to the bar. It took about another 20 mins to be seated which was rather long to me considering I had a reservation before hand, but the music and glass of wine I ordered appeased me for the time being. Once I was finally seated, I waited another 15 mins, before I was acknowledged by a sever. At that time, I probably should've gotten up and walked out, but I was hungry, and didn't feel like going on a hunt in heels for more food. However, I was able to stop a busboy and ask him to grab a server for me. I then was finally brought out some bread, by the same busboy, and about five mins later my server finally came to the table. Another 5 mins later another server came to my table asking if I was ready to order. They clearly had some miscommunication going on in the back. I was happy however once I was able to order and get my short ribs that I had being dying for. They are always tender, well seasoned, delicious. Everything was going rather well, until it was time to get my ticket. That took longer than it should have, so again I was disappointed at the way service was executed during my visit.

4.0,6/11/2016,"Right in the back of the iconic white-curved building, the Grace Building, lies the infamous STK. I have been here three times and it has taken me those three times to finally write a review. Two of times were during lunch and one other time during dinner. My first experience was not as amazing as my rating, but I grew to accept it more as I had the opportunity to come back. As you see the name of a restaurant, you would automatically think STK is derived from the word ""steak"", so the steak must be nothing but the best here. I had the steak here and sadly to say, I definitely had better elsewhere where a steak is more flavorful and delicious. If I remember correctly, the steak was acceptable but not overly amazing. It was a tad dry; but then again if it really caught my taste buds, I would have remembered. Apple and Endive (gorgonzola, walnuts, duck prosciutto) garden salad + shrimp:   This is definitely one of the most delicious salad I have ever had, but then again, I don't ever go out to eat just a salad. I was recommended this and I was feeling that I should be eating healthy and I did. In my salad, I have opted in to add shrimp for $12. The shrimp was definitely a decent size and blended well with the light dressing, walnuts, and duck prosciutto. ** After checking the check and asking the waiter, the $12 shrimps were ""jumbo shrimp"", and it was for two shrimps...the most expensive shrimps I have ever eaten in my entire life. In addition, I was able to try some of the fries from my co-worker and boy, are they on point. The french fries were very thinly cut and seasoned in a way that beats every other fries place I go to. Every time I pass by STK and see people eating lunch, I can't stop thinking about how delicious the fries were. Dinner: Spiced Duck Breast. I have been craving duck ever since I was taken to my first French restaurant and had duck. The duck here is amazingly delicious - Very soft and flavorful. If I ever come back for dinner, it would be a hard decision for me to either pick the duck or try something new..",0,0,0,Irene Y.,"New York, NY",271,73,772

The waiter was knowledgable and charming. We had the incredible tartare, seabass, steak and yuca fries to name a few and each bite got better. The music played in the background while we ate, laughed and enjoyed the atmosphere. Definitely a great date night or place with your girlfriends/friends.

The creamed spinach was really good as well. We each got a cocktail, which were both strong and tasty. Although the menu is a bit pricy, we felt like we got our money's worth at STK.

Great music, they even had a live DJ who got quite a few people dancing. The food was great, steaks were cooked perfectly and even the duck we ordered was deliciously tender. Amazing sides as well, make sure to get the sweet corn pudding. Dessert was good too, we got the warm donuts which were yummy. One thing we did not like was that we had to pay extra for the sauces and any of the sides. Also, the cocktails are watered down and pricey, best to stay away from them.

Waist size not wallet. But when that little baby meat was placed before me I was like ...OK not THAT cute! I asked for medium well and the outside was charred a bit much.

Despite all this it was tolerable and figured not like the food go to waste or complain.When we finally asked for the check it took over half an over to get to us. Bill was $400 (not too terrible) between 6 of us and we figured to tip the waitress over 20% as it is a fancier establishment.

The only issue I had was one of the managers walked back and forth and I didn't see him come stop at anyone of the tables and ask if everyone was satisfied with their meals. It was quite disappointing especially for this establishment. I asked the waitress if the manager can come by. He came by and we did express how we felt about him coming by and asking patrons if they enjoyed the meal. He said we looked like we were having a good time so he didn't want to bother us. I said it's always appreciated when a manager wants to know how everything is. He said he would buy a round of drinks for us when we were done. As thoughtful as it may seem, it would've been nice if he would've bought us a round of drinks to our table as opposed to waiting for us to pay our bill and then moving over the bar. I don't think it was a great approach but everyone is different. We explained to the manager we have our coats on and it's time for us to go.

5.0,1/20/2016,"Okay Let me first start off by saying that I am EXTREMELY picky when it comes to restaurants. I don't have a particularly eclectic palate so I pretty much eliminate all the funky new mix restaurants from my list of options. I settled on STK because looking at Google maps it was one of the few places that popped up but the photos of the interior caught my attention. I was out celebrating two of my best-friends' birthdays and this was the only place that had a menu that seemed to semi-satisfy them. Upon arrival (we were 20min late for our reservation- Saturday night 6pm) we were seated in less than 15 minutes. Our waiter Jermaine was exceptionally attentive and very knowledgeable of the dishes and the wines that would go with them. But now on to the better part. My group consisted of 5 highly inquisitive and excitable ladies. We kinda tended to talk over one another and ask him question simultaneously. A few even went to go as far as to raise eyebrows at the menu prices and ask him about sides being inclusive to meals (something you would find at an olive garden maybe) He was honestly really patient and tolerated every bit of it. Now for the food. It was DELICIOUS! I ordered the Chicken w/ jus naturel and kale and macaroni and cheese on the side. Everyone got different sides to share. The macaroni and cheese was great, the parmesan truffle fries were all right. (Not very truffle-y but the name sounded fancy). I liked the mashed potatoes but my friend who ordered them said they tasted like the boxed Idaho mashed potatoes because they had a thin consistency. The blue cheese covered pull apart bread they serve as you wait was to die for. They will offer drinks for the table to share but beware a sparkling water goes for $9 a bottle and since we were a table of five we had 2 for $18. We told Jermaine that we had two birthday girls and he offered us a round of shots but we declined because of the price (we felt we had spent enough) and he later surprised us with shots on the house. SO. Overall. Venue décor? Gorgeous. Food? Delicious. Ambiance? Popping. And the DJ was amazzzzing that night. Would I come back? Most def.",1,0,0,Sophia B.,"Shirley, NY",0,3,0

Glass of wine recommended by our waiter was very good. I ordered the Sea Bass, and honestly the best sea bass I have ever experienced. My daughter and husband both ordered steak which they loved. We also ordered sides of asparagus and Yukon potatoes. I did not realize the potatoes would be whipped and mashed but there were no lumps to be found in the dish. Although not what I expected, it was good. The only disappointment to me was their dessert selection. I am big on tiramisu or red velvet, to my surprise they had neither. My husband ordered a big Bon Bon filled with ice cream and strawberries. The waiter poured hot chocolate on it to 'explode' it open. Presentation was beautiful but this dessert was so sweet I could not eat it. My daughter had the candy dessert tray which she enjoyed.

4.0,1/12/2016,"Brought my mom here for dinner before a show. Although she was uncomfortable at first with the pricey-ness of the place as it was my treat, I told her to knock it off and get something delicious! We both had a glass of wine - our waitress was very helpful in steering us in the right direction. She even let us taste the different wines they offered for me to see which one we liked best. Which at $15-$18 per glass, that was very appreciated. The complimentary bread was delicious. Pull-apart with blue butter (bleu cheese butter!) and a chive oil dipping sauce. Delish!We both got filet mignon medallions, I got the blue butter and she got the Bernaise sauce to dip. We also got the creamed spinach and Parmesan truffle fries to share. I would perhaps try another side other than the truffle fries they were (slightly) disappointing - I've just had much better. But the presentation was excellent.We had raspberry sorbet to cleanse the pallet.All in all it was a great experience. Only thing was towards the end as the place got packed (around 6:15/6:30) we saw our waitress less and less so it took a while to just pay the bill. Glad I got to see what all the talk was about!",8,2,5,Samantha S.,"Staten Island, NY",5,6,5
5.0,1/11/2016,"I wanted to surprise my boyfriend for his birthday with a top notch place where we both have not gone to before. STK was that and even more, it was beyond excellent and superb service and our server Adrian did a great job making us feel  more than welcomed and answered all of our questions with menu items.  Please note that even though the address states it's on 6th Ave, you have to walk towards 43rd Street to get to the restaurant. As we enter we were greeted and seated right away for our Tuesday 8pm reservation, the décor of STK Midtown is gorgeous. Contemporary modern look, the oval ceilings look as if it was if they were trying to get the look of a steak bone and having the black drapes all around made the white pop out even  more. As soon as we were seated we ordered our drinks and minutes later we received their complimentary warm bread with pesto sauce, it was the perfect amount I might say since by the end of our dinner we were stuffed.Drinks:The boyfriend got the Strawberry Cobbler that consisted of Belvedere vodka, muddled with real strawberries and a graham cracker rim, something I love to come back to because it was that good.I got that Cucumber Stiletto, any drink that contains cucumber and St. Germaine is a winner in my book. The perfect combination of Ketel One Cintroen, muddled cucumber and mint was more than I can ever expect.Appetizer:We got the Tuna Tartar, one of the best ones I've ever had and it has a lot to do with the special honey soy sauce on the bottom of the plate that with every bite it tasted like sushi.Entrée:We decided to share one of their large meat options; we got the 24 oz. porterhouse steak with lobster topping and STK Bold and Chimichurri sauces. For sides we got the Truffle Fries and Mac & Cheese. Everything was perfect I was beyond stuffed by this point and we couldn't finish the rest of the delicious steak.We had to make room for dessert though since I wanted to end the night with some sweets for the boyfriends' birthday, our choice was the Champagne room, it comes with hot chocolate to melt the chocolate layer to get to the strawberry ice scream inside.Thank you STK Midtown for this amazing experience and we will make sure to come back soon and Adrian thanks for the complimentary champagne glass that went well with our dessert.",14,1,5,Lisa R.,"Queens, NY",455,214,335
4.0,1/10/2016,"Came here for a friend's birthday dinner. The food, for the most part, was really good. The complimentary bread (arguably the best part of the meal) with pesto sauce was SOO GOOD. Our waiter offered us another serving of the bread because my friends and I devoured it within seconds. I got the chili rubber rack of lamb and it was phenomenal. The outer layer of crisp complimented the juiciness and tenderness of the meat. The lamb also came with couscous (which I'm not a big fan of) but nevertheless, the lamb was amazing. I had a piece of the steak and it was ok. Personally, I prefer the steak from Peter Lugars or Smith & Wollensky. The sauce was a tad too sweet for my likings. The mac and cheese was really good. Cheesy, but not too cheesy, and had just enough salt. Initially I thought the parmesan fries were going to be amazing. But the overwhelming scent of parmesan was a major turn off and the saltiness only negated the taste of the actual fry. Not worth the money at all.The mashed potatoes were good, but nothing too special. I would recommend the champagne room for dessert and the ice cream sampler. 4 stars instead of 5 because the service was soooooo freaking slow and the music was too loud. You literally had to shout for a person next to you hear you. Overall the dining experience was nice but I doubt I'll ever come here because there are far better places worth the money. Maybe I'll come here during restaurant week for the lamb.",0,0,0,Andrew O.,"New York, NY",7,64,56
2.0,1/10/2016,"I went for an event called Our Family Dinner, for which prices started at the dollar bill Grant is on. The restaurant and utensils were very clean; the service was excellent-excellent (shoutout to the bartender who told me where to sit to be fed first); and the food was decent for a mid-range chain; but the restaurant did not provide the dessert that was included with our three-course menu and I, a lightweight eater, left hungry.The restaurant served us family-style without prior notice, a first for OFD I'm told, and all of the steak was prepared medium-rare. These both came as surprises to all of the guests I spoke with.In my table's case, we also had something resembling popovers, a caesar salad, salmon--4 pieces at a table of 8-- creamed corn, sauteed greens with garlic, mashed potatoes and mushroom risotto. The sides came in portions fit for one person. Again, we were 8 at a table. The dessert menu for the event listed fried churros, which I love and was looking forward to, but no dessert was served. They gave us a salad of lettuces instead. I had a great time at OFD, but I don't feel that STK Midtown upheld its end of the partnership. I'm the kind of person to get full after eating six chicken wings, and I left STK hungry. Even in NYC, and at comparable steakhouses, a Grant is too much to pay to leave hungry.I'd visit again only for that bartender, and only if I want to shell out the bill Andrew Jackson is on per cocktail, and only if I wanted to be in a pretty place.

4.0,12/3/2015,The meal was very good but it definitely isn't up there with the elite NYC steakhouses.  The meat lacked that omg taste but it was still very good.  I have always felt with a steakhouse why should I pay for ok when excellent or amazing is really the same price.  STK is relatively the same price as the famous NYC spots but the atmosphere is anything but classic steakhouse.   They do have some moderately priced options.  They had a house DJ who was playing a great mix of music but it was on the loud side.  The room was very cool and modern.Apps:Bread: I am a sucker for fresh baked bread.  It was very good.Shrimp Cocktail - 3 shrimp for $19.  The shrimp weren't as big as I had hoped and they tasted fresh but had a snap to them that wasn't great.Lil BRGs -  I had high hopes for these but I was pretty disappointed.  The thing that bothered me most was this is a steak house but they give me a well done burger?!  That's a Lil BS! Main:Bone in Ribeye -  I am also a sucker for Bone in Ribeyes.  It was perfectly cooked and tender but it lacked the crisp exterior and some seasoning.  It was very good but again if you haven't been to Brooklyn for steak you will think this is amazing.  For those of us who have we know the difference.Fries - they weren't my choice to order but glad we did.  They were excellent.,2,0,0,Jeff G.,"Forest Hills, Queens, NY",162,208,259

I can see it might be a romantic idea to be so close to your partner while eating. I was with a friend and we both wanted elbow room, and didn't want to be so intimate. The hostess gladly moved us to a large booth. Our server was Rachel . She was super friendly. For starters I ordered the Tuna Tartare. It was delicious. My friend ordered the shrimp cocktail. It came with 3 large shrimps. For entrees I ordered the Big Eye tuna cooked medium. It was only OK. I should of ordered the steak instead. My friend order the recommend 12 oz bone in filet Mignon medium rare. It was a nice piece of steak but the ends were over cooked. We told the waitress and she did offer to bring out another steak that was pink all the way through. Since it was late we opted out of that . The sides were asparagus, and broccolini. They are good. My favorite was the dessert ! They have an amazing bantam cream pie in a jar. With a unique lemon meringue with a little bite at the end. A must try ! Over all a good experience.

I came here with my coworkers, and we each ordered different dishes to try, but the one that stood out the most for side dish, definitely were the mash potatoes and green pepper grits. Just a heads up, there is a dress code for dining inside, preferably ""upscale"" as they stated in their website. Lucky for us, we just finished working and had our suits on and the ladies, all looked like they were ready to paint the town, looking ""fabulous!!""Until then, Cheers ~ :p",14,5,9,Edwin R.,"San Francisco Bay, CA",114,1069,8928

The restaurant is beautiful. The only reason I'm giving this a 4 instead of a 5 is because I felt the steak was not on the same level as other high end steakhouses.

As my entree, I had the short rib which was free of the jiggly pieces that are often attached, and it was a succulent, generous portion.  I also sampled a piece of Mike's spiced duck which was delightful as well.  We split the jalapeno grits and haricots verts as our side dishes, which complemented our respective proteins nicely.   I forget which potables Mike imbibed but I had the Strawberry Cobbler Martini which, again, was tastier than I remembered...and I loved it last time.  That may have had something to do with strawberries being in season.  No birthday would be complete with a special dessert and the birthday boy struggled to pick something from the menu because it all sounded so good!  Ultimately, he selected the Meyer lemon cheesecake which had a fluffy, light consistency, and came with strawberries and a chocolate that said ""Happy Birthday"" on it.  It was picture-perfect and I will no longer only associate Meyer lemons with soap.  I could not have asked for a better dinner.  Thank you, STK Midtown, for such a wonderful experience, and happy birthday again, ya big Chooch!",7,2,4,Caroline B.,"New York, NY",457,1247,36

2.0,5/9/2015,"We had previously went to the STK in the meatpacking district and had an amazing time & I was trying to locate a place to take out my hubby to celebrate a huge success he had at work, so I made reservations at STK Midtown & requested one of their big plushy booths. I gave them a head's up that we would be there for a big celebration which I also called to confirm a few hours before along with the booth request.When we arrived, we were actually seated in the front area at a rather small table & my husband is a rather tall guy with long legs, so he had to squeeze in there when the hostess seated us.  I didn't want to make a big deal of it, but strike one. Plus a minute later they sat a family next to us with a toddler...I felt like I was at Applebee's especially when they proceeded to take out a plethora of toys for the infant to play with...mind you, this is at 9:30pm on a Friday night.  Not the most romantic setting for a couple celebrating & hardly what we envisioned.  Thank u STK Host Staff for disregarding my numerous requests & your lack of customer service.Next, we selected our champagne from the nice list they had and the waitress brought out the rose instead of the brut & had to go back to get the correct bottle which only prolonged the much anticipated toast I was waiting to make all night.....Strike Two. Our appetizers were excellent, Alaskan King crab, tuna crudo and east and west coast oysters.  The west coast oysters happened to be my favorite, Kushi, and last night they were on point!!  I loved them so much I had to order an additional half a dozen & the order came right out, however, they brought out the east coast in error and when I told the waitress, she said no, those are Kushi, I very politely said I am certain these are not Kushi and are east coast.  At this point in my life, I know the difference between East & West coast oysters especially what a Kushi looks like, my favorite oyster...Strike Three.....anyhow, she said I'll be right back and left the oysters on the table and obviously went back to the kitchen to see who was right....she came back a minute later to collect the oysters and apologized for the mistake.  She said the kushi's would be immediately out and no joke, we waited a total of 20 minutes....at that point, I didn't even want the oysters, my tummy was growling for the main course!  And if it weren't for the happy occasion, I would have canceled or complained, but they finally came out and were amazing!!The skirt steak was okay, have had better, but loved the porterhouse...the mashed were awesome and the asparagus were good.  The banana cream pie in a jar is outrageous!!!  So, I would have to say, the food and vibe  are stellar, but the waitress we had and host staff leaves a lot to be desired.  There were even additional mistakes (on the check, with the wine, espresso, it was pretty ridiculous actually) but I don't want to bore with the details.....The best part of the night was the exceptional tunes played by the DJ (old school hip hop and other old school jams) which was the only reason that I didn't let the below average service sour our experience, but we will not be returning.STK in the meatpacking district is a much better experience & there are so many other options as well....",6,2,2,Jessica B.,"Astoria, Queens, NY",39,47,101
2.0,5/7/2015,"I was very surprised to be a paying customer at this place, but I was not surprised at all by the rating I wanted to give by the end of the night. STK's concept is ""not your daddy's steakhouse."" So it's a little strange that one exists in this location, the district of dads on expense account dinners/lunches. I don't find the concept itself gauche per se, but the execution of the concept is truly offensive. According to the STK people, women want to pay too much to go to a steakhouse and wait 2 hours for half portions of steak JUST so we don't have to eat steak in a dark, gloomy restaurant full of wrinkly men with bellies (oh, except that they're here too, ladies).  First, the good: the reservation was for 8 and we ended up being a party of 12 for a birthday. The host did not miss a beat and within 10-15, mins we were seated. It all went downhill from there. No one ordered more than 2 courses (thank god). The dinner took 3 hours to serve. It took half an hour to serve the drinks and half the table ordered wine by the glass. The steaks were all 10 secs away from frozen, and plated with nothing more than 2 strands of picked onions.I don't get it. You were on notice that there was at least one BIG group coming in (the room we ended up in was a result of cancellation, so in theory, the kitchen should have been overprepared for us). When you offer a reservation and charge a service fee for big groups, I expect that those things serve a function in your operations rather than an arbitrary obligation for large groups. We actually expressed our discontent to an employee, presumably a manager, who came by. We did not mince our words. All that was done? The steaks were taken to the back and reheated, along with the plates (presumably in the broiler), which obviously ruined the meat. No other check up followed, nothing to comp for the horrendous food service. The fries were terrible, the steak tartare was a mush, the soft shell crab was not fresh. The best part of the meal was the broccolini. Btw, the floor to ceiling glass windows in the private rooms? Would've been a good idea if this were a top floor restaurant, but on street level?

We went with the jalepeno grits and the lobster mac n cheese for the sides. An absolutely amazing dinner.

3.0,4/17/2015,"Being that this STK is in midtown, do not be surprised by the amount of suits (mostly 30s-40s) present on a Thursday evening for after work drinks or client meals. I expected a few more ladies but maybe that's more of a Friday Girls' Night Out kind of thing. The décor here is modern and intriguing, very fitting for a snazzy chain such as STK. The three of us were seated at a plush half booth by the entryway immediately upon arrival, despite being 20 minutes early for our reservation.  I can appreciate this especially because the bar was packed and being seated felt like the more comfortable choice. Service is good here; the servers are just attentive enough and are quick on their feet. One thing of note: a bit of polishing up is needed as one of the servers accidently stuck his thumb in my friend's blue butter while placing it on the table and made for a very awkward presentation. So how's the food? Pretty good.  Among the 3 of us we ordered a skirt steak, filet, and bone-in rib eye. All cooked medium rare and tasty with the exception of the thicker ribeye which came out a tad too rare. We sent it back to the kitchen, which our server graciously accommodated.  The gratis bread is adorable! I'm not a fan of blue cheese or chive but it's one of the more unique bread options I've seen. The jalapeno grits are skippable (although very warm and comforting if you're craving grits..just don't expect much jalapeno flavor), the mac and cheese is like any good ol' American mac and cheese, and the grilled asparagus gives the meal some nice greens. Our drinks were also well made with my White Orchid being quite refreshing if you are looking for something ginger-y and light.I'm glad I finally crossed STK off my list, but since NYC has tons more steak options to offer it's not likely I would return.

When we finally sat at a table, the drinks were adequate but overpriced; bread was good, but had to ask for it; and the steak, at a steak place, was so so. The staff seem like good people overextended in a place that may be trying too hard. Though they did try by covering our first drinks.

3.0,4/6/2015,"IN SHORT: STK transforms the concept of the original, old-moneyed steakhouse into something young and swanky. The result is food that feels less experienced than its storied elders.THE STORY: Even in its Midtown location, miles away from its juiced up, nightclub of a sister in Meatpacking, STK still doesn't know whether it wants to be seen as a serious steakhouse or simply a raucous destination before the night's revelries. As such, arriving for dinner here still feels like unwittingly stumbling into a party you weren't invited to, and never wanted to go to anyway, particularly as you notice the DJ booth in the center of the large, dark space. As you watch someone spinning the turntables at 7:30 on a Friday night, you can't help but wonder if it's all just a huge joke, if someone at The ONE Group is laughing at the absurdity of a space like this right next to the corporate bastion of the Grace Building, and across the street from the powerfully glistening Bank of America Tower. For all of its emphasis on scene, it appears that STK has judged its surroundings in error, as the space never seems to be filled to capacity, and reservations are perpetually available at the very last minute.It is unforunate, this seemingly dishonest pursuit of a nightclub's atmosphere, because some of the steaks on STK's menu are actually quite good. Whether STK's cultivated crowd actually notices the nuances of texture and adept handling of temperature in their steaks is up for debate. But the 10 oz. filet I recently sampled was richly seasoned and cooked to a luscious medium rare, more or less fairly priced at $46. I've had a lot less for a lot more. In order to cater to various appetites and budgets, though, STK organizes their steaks by small, medium, and large, and also offers cheaper proteins if you are not interested in turning steak into a pregame-like detour of the night.Some appetizers are playful like the Foie Gras French Toast, but others fare less well, like the Parmesan Truffle Fries that desperately yearn for more salt and more nutty Parmesan to better balance the oddly dense cuts of whole potato. Yet despite its lack of inspiration and earnestness in dining, STK does deserve credit for transforming the tradition of the steakhouse into something new and sexy. If only it could still cater to the other young workers in the area who are just looking for a steakhouse to call their own.",2,2,3,Ali M.,"New York, NY",31,234,245

I personally loved the ceiling design - super cool. The DJ played great music and it was at a reasonable volume where you didn't have to struggle to hear your partner or walk out with ringing ears. We walked out smiling ear to ear instead!We started with the raw bar seafood platter for two which contained seafood that was deliciously crisp and fresh and the presentation was beautiful. The mussels were my favorite. It contained a variety of dipping sauces, all different and delicious in their own unique ways.We shared the 10 ounce filet mignon, which they offered to slice upon discovering we would be splitting. This was super convenient and it also allowed us to see our meal cooked to perfection (medium rare). We also ordered the cream of spinach, which melted in your mouth, and the mushrooms for our sides.The staff is extremely attentive and answered any questions we had, as well as detailing the specials of the day in mouthwatering detail. I'll be sure to order one of those next time I'm in!Even the General Manager came over to stop at our table to ask how everything was. It was a really nice change of pace to see a GM really taking pride in his job by walking around and not being in an office somewhere. He was excited learning it was our first time there and we were more than happy to tell him we would be back again!The only negative thing I have to say is there was a table of three women cackling on to no end, speaking and laughing extremely loud - to the point where many diners had annoyed looks on their faces and I was thankful we weren't seated directly next to them.

SHOCKING! She made it for the day He called but repeated back to him Saturday. So she told him sat. And made it for Friday.  Just confirm your reservation in advance.

My date and I started off the evening at the bar where the lovely bartender made a deliciously refreshing cocktail. We were then seated at our table where my date and I started off with tuna tartar, sliders, and a combination of east and west coast oysters. The tartar was on point but the sliders were excellent. As we were transitioning to the entree (a big ole bone in steak for two) our lovely waitress Erin went above and beyond in helping me decide on the right glass of red wine to accompany my meal. Now for the entree we shared a juicy bone in steak that nearly knocked my socks off as well as the Mac n cheese, creamed spinach, and Brussels sprouts sides. All three were great but the Brussels sprouts were hands down the best. I'm so glad Erin recommended them. Well, I was certainly in a food coma after all that but I couldn't turn down dessert.

Our server was Lenny, he was patient with us and very informative with all the questions we had. Plus he made sure everything was taken care of correctly, even if a food runner was assisting him.    We were starving from walking around the museum all day and Lenny saw how much we enjoyed the bread and offered us a second helping. The food was amazing. Steak cooked to perfection. I got the medium sized filet. My husband got the rib eye. For sides we got the mashed potatoes which were velvety smooth and buttery. Mac and cheese- soooo good. And the brocolini. For desert we had the pumpkin donuts which were good but not as good as my husbands dessert which was the molasses rum cake... Yummy!

4.0,12/21/2014,"I went here for lunch with my coworkers, so I'll review it as a LUNCH spot - since I've heard different stories for dinner time. It has an average noise level and is full of other professionals in the area dining. Our table ordered the seafood appetizer (oysters, tuna, shrimp cocktail and crab legs). I love that is was made to order and was fresh. Only complaint is that the oysters weren't super, super fresh like they are in the summer time. Thankfully we had that as an appetizer because I got the beet salad with shrimp which was DELICIOUS but not for someone that was expecting a full meal. It was fresh, shrimp was charred great and very flavorful. The service was a little off. We were having a leisurely lunch and the waiter pestered us 3 times in a row within 5-10 minutes though we were still looking at the menu - then failed to check on us much after we ordered. However there were larger parties at the restaurant, so completely understandable.I'd go back and venture during dinner time since the food was very fresh and good.",0,0,0,Gabby S.,"Brooklyn, NY",2,85,7

Staff were very attentive and the place is gorgeous. The architecture is pretty cool as well and it just looks like a place where fun happens.Onto the food. The complementary sweet fluffy bread is to DIE for. So good I ate three ""rolls"" and had to force myself to stop and save room for steak. It comes in a green cilantro butter dip that is also to die for, the combination of which is an explosion of many flavors light spices with a buttery texture.Apps: we got a seafood platter, they come with mini Tabasco sauces that were cute/funny. Their oysters were really good but could do a little better job of cleaning so you don't eat broken shell pieces. The jumbo shrimp were indeed jumbo. The red tuna sashimi were really good as well and taste much better to me than what is usually given at a sushi restaurant. Crab tasted like crab, gotta dip in the right sauces. Everything was just very fresh, and with seafood in particular you gotta go fresh.Entree: I got ribeye and it was DELISH. A huge 20 oz chunk of meat fit for a king. They have their own steak sauce and it was really good. You could also use the green butter sauce on this as well which is a nice change. A friend got duck which was really nicely cooked as well.Sides: we had potato puree, cream of spinach, all typical stuff...Spinach was especially amazing. Potato could be a little more fluffy. We also ordered truffle fries and these are behemoths of fries. They were like logs. Each order is about 8 or so of those logs, and they were yumz. We also got mac and cheese which was really good, as I do like the crusty top.Dranks: we had two reds and one was apparently Charles Krug Cabernet Sauvignon, that was my fav by a long shot.

As an appetizer, we got the shellfish platter for 6 people, which was honestly enough for the table. Super delicious - some highlights were amazing tuna sashimi and crab. Finally, I got a medium filet mignon with bearnaise sauce, which was perfectly cooked.

4.0,11/6/2014,"Came here for a work-related dinner and thoroughly enjoyed the meal.For appetizers, we split the shellfish platter which was good but nothing extraordinary -- the jumbo shrimp was probably the best thing on the plate but oysters were less than mediocre. Note that they charge per person partaking in the platter.We ordered parmesan truffle fries which had a consistency more similar to yucca fries (thick, starchy), creamed spinach with fried onions, truffle mac & cheese and wild mushrooms as sides which were as indulgent as they were delicious.I got the bone-in filet (medium) which I found to be good but once again, not extraordinary. Our waitress highly recommended we outfit our steak with toppings and a choice for 8 sauces which I found odd since I was always a taught a good steak needed none of that. In any case, I went with the peppercorn crust and STK bold sauce which ended up being poor choices -- the peppercorn was a bit heavy and overpowered the steak and the ""STK bold"" sauce was comparable to a toned down version of A1. Steak itself was tender and cooked to perfection.They sat us almost an hour after our reservation which was absurd but bar area was fun and the entire time, the music was perfect. Service itself was good, when our waitress was around but there could have been a bit more attention. Had to flag down staff twice for more water.Because there are so many antiquated steakhouses in New York and STK is all over the country, I don't think I would go again in NY voluntarily but would not be opposed to going at all if someone suggested it and/or if in a different city. All in all - great ambiance and solid food. Also, I don't think I spoke to this enough  but the DJ was REALLY good like I wanted to inquire about their info and go to any place they DJ'ed.

Although, when you combine the two - maybe it bumps the overall experience down to a 3? I don't know how to describe this place. Is it a restaurant? A club? A bar? It's some interesting hybrid of the three which makes it a little less appealing to go to for dinner. It's VERY loud. The DJ played great music but it's certainly not ""dinner-at-a-steakhouse"" music. There were people dancing their hearts out right next to our dinner table. I have to say, I found it all fairly entertaining (my favorite pasttime is people-watching) but it wasn't the best atmosphere for the business dinner we had there. The food was excellent. I had the bone-in ribeye with bleu butter, and shared a variety of sides with the table. Of particular interest were the spinach and the mac & cheese. Also, the mashed potatoes were so creamy I was beginning to doubt they were actually potatoes. We really enjoyed our meal. The wine selection was a bit disappointing, although the few selections that I did try were delicious. I am just used to seeing a few more options than what they had, and found the wine list very hard to read as it related to prices vs. the year of the wine - which brings me to my final point... the prices here are a bit out of control. I am not from New York and don't dine there very often so perhaps they're on par for a steakhouse in NYC, but I was blown away. $30 just to have truffles shaved on a steak? I'll pass, thank you.All in all, I had a good time here and really enjoyed the food... might not go back for a casual, relaxing dinner ever again but it's certainly the place to go if you want to get your groove on in between courses.",1,1,1,Melanie D.,"Providence, RI",121,191,5

We quickly ordered and got started with our meal. Tuna tartare to start and a 20 ounce bone in rib eye with yukon potatoes and wild mushrooms on the side. All in all, the meal was good. Not the best, but not the worst, just alright and passable. The tuna tartare was good, but there was a ton of avocado and not enough tuna. Maybe i should have mixed it a little better, but I was always left with a mouthful of avocado and as a person who doesn't love avocado (i know, i'm crazy), it wasn't the greatest dish. Our steaks came out and while it was cooked perfectly as ordered, it just wasn't amazing. Something about their steaks just don't even stand up to those from Del Frisco's or other steak houses. The juices were running, the flavor was alright, but the STK sauce was quite delicious. I never use sauce, but I couldn't have finished the steak without it. As far as the sides go, the mushrooms were delicious and the mashed potatoes were not creamy enough and just kind of bound together like glue...We finished the meal with pumpkin spice doughnuts which were delicious. Dare I say they were better than the main course? All in all, service was great and Ryan did an amazing job at meeting our every need. The food definitely wasn't the best, but it wasn't the worst.

3.0,10/3/2014,"My rating would honestly sit somewhere between 2 and 3 stars, but I gave 3 stars since the manager, Inga, did her best to take care of us yesterday evening.  While the atmosphere is definitely poppin' and the music is lounge and almost club-like. The night started off with the live DJ spinning 80's/90's music and moved into current music.  Service - we requested a table around 5:30 for 7 and were immediately seated, but were told that we would essentially be ""kicked out"" of our table at 7:15pm for another reservation.  7pm came around and the servers came around to ask if we were supposed to leave at 7:15.  The leaving of the table never happened, probably because they saw that we were racking up a bill that was probably more than 5 of their tables combined.  Our server was very rushed the entire night and wanted to take our order for all drinks, appetizers, and entrees for the entire evening in one shot.  He probably didn't realize we were planning on ordering the whole menu or something, but regardless, the entire night seemed rushed and for as much as the food here costs and as much as we spent, I would have expected far, far better service.  I was constantly having to hail people over to the table to help us.  I did most of the ordering and instead of just listening to me, the server kept trying to tell me what I should order and kept suggesting I add more and more things to my order.  I ordered 1 thing of each thing and somehow, we were presented with multiple orders (mac and cheese, lamb chops, octopus, and foie gras).  We ended up with many leftovers at the end of the night.  These guys must think that if we're going to spend so much already, it's okay to throw a few extra dishes here and there even though we didn't ask for them?  I understand that some of these dishes were small, but we weren't really trying to get it so that everyone could have one full piece of every appetizer and etc.The prices here are really $$$-$$$$ (mostly $$$$) and for that price point, you would expect the food to be far superior than it actually was. Very disappointing, really.  I would also like to note that all the dishes were not hot, some actually quite cold, and at most lukewarm.  Shellfish platter - $29 per person - tuna sashimi, tiny tiny oysters, jumbo shrimp, and crab.  Crab was extremely salty, tuna - better at sushi houses, the oysters were so small I wouldn't say it's worth it, and the jumbo shrimp was standard.2 whole lobsters split in two - $72 each - the first piece I ate was undercooked.2 dozen oysters $72 - oysters were so minimal on the shellfish platter we ordered 2 dozen more - all tiny, as expected.Beef tartare $20 - would not recommend - not a memorable dish.Tuna tartare $19 - tuna over avocado - this was actually one of the most liked dishes of the night.  Who doesn't love tuna and avocado?  The taro chips were probably unnecessary.Foie Gras French Toast $22- I've never had grilled foie gras, but this was gross.  The foie gras and the sweet french toast just did not mesh well.  Do not recommend.  Somehow we ended up with two of these orders.Cripsy pork belly $19 - I only had a small piece, but yes, it was crispy, and the fat to flesh ratio was spot on.3.5 orders of scallops $72 - waiter decided to give us multiple orders Octopus $22 - again, somehow we ended up with two.  Too salty and you taste more of the burned grilled flavor than any octopus (tiny tentatcles)Kobe steak $36/oz x 8 oz = $288 - obviously, this was the star of the night.  Well seasoned and very soft and tender pink inside. I've never had kobe beef before so I can't compare it to anything, but it had a smoky flavor that tasted like bacon.  Based on the other dishes though, I'd safely say that if you were to have kobe steak, maybe go to a steakhouse with a better reputation of producing juicy steaks.14 oz Delmonico $65 - forced on by the waiter when I tried to order a porterhouse - was not juicy, didn't have much flavor, not worth the money.Spiced big eye tuna $37 - not the best I've ever had, but acceptable.  Tuna quality is questionable.Grilled lamb $45 x 2 - I've had far better lamb for sure.  The umami moment did not happen for me here as it usually does when I have good lamb (Fogo de chao)Spiced duck breast $34 - should be called spiced duck fat.  Do not recommend.Truffle mac and cheese - $52 x 2 - so I wanted to order mac and cheese.  Then the server suggested truffle mac and cheese, so naturally I said yes!  What he didn't mention was that truffle itself would be an upcharge for $40 each.  I ordered 1 mac and cheese and ended up with two, with expensive white truffles over each.  Only two bites were eaten from both.Short rib $35 - if you get this as an entree, prepared to be starving after.  This had the best flavor of the meats (minus kobe)*Coffee/tea never came.Desserts $12 each - not worth getting any of them except maybe the brownie... and I've reached the 5000 character limit",14,5,2,Allene T.,"Manhattan, NY",2170,1311,3573

It was cooked to the perfect temperature, moist and juicy. I loved it! The sides were great as well! The dessert was tasty though it looked more beautiful than it tasted. Sometimes, I prefer a straightforward dessert (chocolate lava cake!) than something that tries to be something fancy through presentation. This is a ""see and be seen"" steakhouse. People come here to rub-elbows not necessarily to inhale steak. If you're looking for a place like that, go to Wolfgang's - this is a good choice when you want something trendy.",1,0,0,Liz B.,"Manhattan, NY",332,220,909
4.0,8/26/2014,"Coming to STK Midtown with the right expectations and the right frame of mind will really help you with your experience at this trendy Midtown restaurant. While most steakhouses in NYC have the reputation of attracting the walking dead, STK has quite the opposite.Like the patrons it draws every Thursday night, the space itself is quite easy on the eyes with its black and off-white color combination with copious amounts of leather furnishings throughout. There are two private rooms available for personal or corporate events with multiple food and drink packages to choose from. The management team is very courteous, professional and helpful in this regard. In my opinion the bar scene is really where this establishment shines- here, it's easy to pop in for a bite and enjoy a stiff cocktail while perusing the attractive assembly without completely breaking the bank. Note that this is a frequent hotspot for Wall Street sales guys so there are often men in suits cavorting about throwing lavish amounts of money on company plastic... Naturally they could care less about the extravagant numbers they're racking up while entertaining clients for dinner. Yes the food is overpriced (for example, $12 for a simple romaine salad comprising of about 4 leaves) but you already knew you are paying for the scene more so than the cuisine. That's not to say the food isn't yummy (STEAK STEAK STEAK) but you are not getting the full bang for your buck... but with the crowd the way it is, you might just get your bang later.

3.0,8/13/2014,I made a last minute reservation to this location on a short girls weekend in NYC. Typically in other locations I've visited we've been seated with no issues but this particular location makes you wait until everyone in the party is in the restaurant. Unfortunately for us this was a busy Saturday night in the city so we ended up at the bar for about 30-35 minutes until finally the waitress gave up and seated us. While we waited we had what I believe were Hennessy mojitos that were actually pretty good. The location is huge but the ambiance was really dark and clubby. As it was a Saturday night we didn't mind. There was also a dj so it came off as more of a lounge than a restaurant. Our waiter was awesome and the food came out quickly. I felt like the brussel sprouts could've been better but the steak was standard and cooked perfectly. I felt like the wait staff got a little pushy towards the night as we ordered more drinks. The place was going to be open for a little longer and we were continuing to order as they rushed us after every drink. Overall I think this location fits in line with the other STKs in the chain.

When we were seated our server was great. Very informative and attentive, stopped by our table multiple times to find out if we needed anything and to make sure everything was ok. We both ordered skirt steak, mine with asparagus and my boyfriend ordered the truffle fries. The steaks were very good and the asparagus was very tasty.

Also, while i love good music in a restaurant, beware that it turns into a club-scene around 9/930pm and you will not be able to hear your neighbors speak - so you may want to consider this depending on the company you're with.But again, food & wine is always top-notch here.",0,0,0,A G.,"Manhattan, NY",0,15,0

Our waitress was kind enough to bring us a second one because it was so good. For dinner, we both had the medium skirt steaks with mac & cheese and parmesan truffle fries.

The truffle fries were ok. As for our drinks, I had the passion forward which was strong and tasty, and my bf had the top dog which he didn't really like. The only complaint I have is that the drinks have way too much ice, but besides that we had a marvelous time. It's important to note that I really cannot get over the amazing service.

The least favorite of the steaks was the Kobe beef steak, the texture and taste of it my friend did not like.  For sides, we shared the wild mushrooms and the truffle fries which were my personal favorite.  Overall, this place is great if you're looking for a fun dinner, with good music, food and cocktails!   P.S: Try the Green Intensity (vodka, fresh lime, jalapeño, basil)- perfect balance of flavor and spice......

1.0,5/19/2014,"It was a Sunday evening and I had just spent a day in the city with my wife and 2 year old son. We were trying to decide where to eat but everyone had between  a 30-60 minute wait. We called STK and asked about the wait time for dinner, the lady who answered the phone said they had seating available and wanted to know how big our party was. Once I mentioned I had a toddler she said "" Oh, we actually don't have a high chair"".. I responded not a problem, he can stay in the stroller. Her response was ok, come in we'll figure it out (I also want to mention we weren't dressed for a fancy dinner, just jeans and sneakers).Once I arrived I was seated quick and surprisingly offered a high chair by one of the bus boys (Strike 1). We were recommended the specials of the day and given menus, after placing an order for appetizers, drinks and entree the wait time began.A couple was seated not to far from us (Well dressed) after our order was placed. To keep my story short they had appetizers and steak before we were even served our Bone-in rib steak. We waited a total of 20 minutes for appetizers, 50 minutes after appetizers for our steak. I drank my first mojito quick and it wasn't even acknowledged by the server (Leonel) or his manager. They kept walking around checking on other tables and ignoring us, we were never even approached about the delay. After getting the server's attention and ordering my second mojito I waited for 15 minutes to be served. It was frustrating to see the server ask tables next to us if they were good or needed anything and never checked up on us for anything. I did a great job entertaining my 2 year old son that was cranky and tired. He was quiet and calm the whole time (I should of let him scream and create a scene). In the end the food was delicious but with such poor service it leaves a bad taste in anyone's mouth especially after spending $216 (not including tip) for 2 people. I gave the appropriate suggested tip (which I hope goes to the bus boys and chef). Before I left I told the server about his poor service and he apologized and went to get a manager (He never came back).  Tip: Be prepared to spend money and dress to impress if you want to be recognized.",4,0,1,Leonel J.,"Rego Park, NY",16,4,1

The burger was ok, the frois gras added absolutely nothing to the flavor/texture. Had a salad with the burger.

The venue itself is beautiful but the main seating area can be a little tight for larger groups (unless you're in a booth). The bar area is great and very spacious.

They gave us a great little booth for two and our waitress was so sweet. She gave great recommendations and was very friendly. The drinks were delicious (and strong) which was a plus. I got the skirt steak with blue butter dressing and my boyfriend got the filet with king crab on top - TOO good. The fudge dessert was amazing. The white chocolate with cheetah print was so cute. DJ Martial played the best mix of music which caused people to drunkenly dance; it was great. There was no judgement! Everyone was having a great time. Such a classy but laid back place.

It's covered with a lot of garlic and pesto (not sure?). There are also side dips that tasted like green onion, I really don't know what it was. But the bread was really flavorful and pungent, so I only scooped out one ball to eat. Definitely not a good smell to have in your mouth before finishing the rest of your interviews.I ordered off the $26 prixe-fix lunch menu for restaurant week and ordered:Pumpkin squash soup - so good! The chunks of goat cheese bursted in my mouth and added a great texture to a perfect ""autumn tasting"" soup.Duck confit - Some parts of the duck were dry, but really tender on the inside. The ""winter vegetables"" were really salty and I couldn't really eat them all. It was okay.Sorbet trio - Nothing special. It came with blackberries and a mint leaf.

The architecture, specifically the ceiling, is pretty cool. Anyway, service was outstanding from start to finish. The host and waiter were extremely gracious and polite. Seriously, give these people a raise. For restaurant week, you get an appetizer, an entree, and dessert for a flat fee of $25 (lunch). My friend and I both got the pumpkin squash soup for apps, which was my favorite part of the meal. I got the duck and he got the chicken paillard. I felt my dish was just okay. It tasted like chicken and had chunks of fat around it. It was nothing to write him about. As for dessert, STK gives you sorbet (only option), which was, again, nothing special. I felt I could get the same thing at Ralph's Ices. So all in all, one star for ambiance, one for service, and one for that soup. Otherwise, the food didn't blow me away, and I think my friend agreed.

I ordered the ""medium"" sized steak. My steak was the envy of the people who ordered small. For $5 more you get double the ounces for the skirt steak. Trust me its worth it. The sauce (which you have to pay for) chimichurri was nice. The parmesan fries were amazing. The truffle taste was interesting. I should have shared but it was too goooood. I also ordered the bag of donuts. I think I would have it enjoyed it more if it didn't have the filling. The bread they offered was good too. The waitress was ok, but mildly neglectful. The music was on point.  I would recommend this place for really really special occasions. Also you have to pay for all of your sides separately $12 a pop, so if you are going with other folks let them know that so they aren't surprised. If you don't get appetizers and just do a steak, side, and dessert,  you are looking at $50 for just yourself easy...so I wouldn't recommend it for those who are budget conscious.",0,0,0,Mel D.,"Brooklyn, NY",22,62,13

We were in terrible traffic (3 blocks from the restaurant) and called the restaurant at 5:30 to notify them we were nearby but in a lot of traffic. The hostess answered the phone (very abruptly) and said, ""15 minutes, that's all you have, otherwise we give your table away"". I understand that you might have a policy, but for a ""nice"" restaurant you'd think she would've been a little nicer! Obviously this put a sour taste in our mouth right off the bat, but we ended up making it at 5:45 on the dot (to an empty restaurant nonetheless, very frustrating!). There was no where to check your coats, according to the hostess, so we sat at a table with our coats on our chairs (was this a $50 dinner or $350?...the latter). Our waiter was nice, drinks were OK (my martini was actually bitter and not tasty at all, barely had 2 sips, and the waiter didn't ask once if there was something wrong with it).Apps were excellent; tuna, shrimp cocktail, kobe burgers. All great. Sides were small but delicious and steaks were great. Not excellent (Uncle Jack's, Keens, all much better).Desserts were terrible, not to mention the fact that our waiter offered us our check, and we had to cut him off to ask him for a dessert menu.

2.0,12/11/2013,"On a recent Tuesday evening, I had arrived with two of three of my guests at 5:45pm for a 6:00pm reservation. Upon entering the cavernous, extremely loud STK, one is greeted by a gaggle of hosts/hostesses.  Since my fourth guest was in transit, we were denied a table and summarily dismissed.  We were instructed to have a drink at the bar, while we waited.  We were also told that the coat check was downstairs as apparently there was no one available to check coats.  Nice.This is where the fun begins.   In order to get to the coat check, one has to battle through the huddled, after work masses as the stairs for the coat check are on the far side of the bar area.  So if you want to check a coat, prepare to fight your way through the crowd.  What a great way to start an evening of ""fine"" dining!Having accomplished our coat check, no easy task, we apprehensively appraised the teeming bar and estimated that it would be a good 15+ minutes just to get our cocktails.  Even if we had managed to secure drinks, there was no place to enjoy them as the bar area was more crowded than the subway at rush hour.  Since we were actually there for dinner, not post work libations, the logical answer was to be seated at one of the many empty tables throughout the restaurant.As such, I approached the young queen that I had spoken to upon check-in and requested that we be seated at our table so that we could enjoy a cocktail before dinner.  He then asked me if my final guest had arrived, which he had not.  He then proceeded to lecture me that under no uncertain terms could he make an exception for us.  Since my reservation was literally for the first seating of the evening and that there were many open tables, I pleaded with him, and he smugly said, ""NO"".  Let's just say that this a-hole set the tone for the remainder of the evening.Since there was no way that my guests and I were going to battle the bridge and tunnel crowd at the bar, we simply stood around waiting for our remaining guest, who showed up at 6:05pm.  We were then promptly seated by our sad little host, who seemed very pleased with himself that he made us wait.The evening continued to go downhill from here.  Of course at this point, we were all desperate for a drink.  From the time that our server approached us to actually getting our drink was 40 minutes.  This was typical of the piss poor service and timing that we experienced all evening.  Our air headed server, seemed stressed, ditsy, and flirty all at the same time.  The flirty part comes from the open buttons on her shirt and the silly banter that she awkwardly thrust upon us all evening.  It was a total FAIL.In all honesty, the food was pretty decent.  It is what one would expect from a typical steakhouse in NYC.  That being said, it did not compensate for our poor start, the awful service, the bad timing, and the booming music, which made conversation virtually impossible.  This is especially the case when considering the price point.  For my party of four, the total bill for the meal with tips and drinks (including a couple of bottles of wine) was about $800.  The bill itself was not a problem for my party, but the combination of all of the other issues leaves me no choice but to give this place two stars.Based upon what we spent, I would assume that my party and I are exactly the types of guests that  STK would want to attract on a regular basis.  However, at the price point, there are much nicer, much better establishments to choose from in  our fair city.  As such, I plan on never returning to STK, and I would strongly suggest if you are considering this restaurant that you take a pass as well.You've Been Warned!!",4,1,1,Tim S.,"New York, NY",3,100,0

That said, my co-workers who do eat meat REALLY enjoyed the place so I'm adding this to my rating.  We met here after a meeting ran late - there were probably 20 of us and we arrived just a few minutes before their scheduled closing and they were super accommodating to us.  Based on the excellent service we received, you would never had known we arrived so late or stayed so late.   The food was served on a perfect schedule - no one waited too long for anything.  The waitress also asked if I wanted my salad with my sides or an appetizer - not all places will ask this so it was nice.  The waitstaff was so attentive you didn't even realize they were there.  Wine glasses were filled and you never saw anyone pouring ... you'd talk and then look over and your wine glass was full again.   A it dangerous if you're driving since you can easily lose track of how much you've had, so I cut myself off early. That said, I'd wholeheartedly recommend STK to my carnivore friends.  If you're a vegetarian though, I'd try to steer your dinner companions elsewhere so you can have a more satisfying meal.",0,0,0,Leilani B.,"Cliffside Park, NJ",131,138,92

They have the best truffle parm fries in the world. and they stack them on a cute little pan. some swear Delicatessen or other places have the best truffle fries? NOPE, right here people. They also have the best sweet corn pudding. i know it sounds wierd but get some in your mouth and you can thank me later. Their cocktails are really amazing too. something with strawberries and another with ginger. Don't rmb the exact names but the whole list is worth trying- those are just my 2 favorites!Unfortunately I don't eat beef and I haven't had any of the entrees here so I cannot comment on that, BUT i have had the lumb crab salad and amazing. REAL CRAB - I know this bc I'm allergic and one bite my tongue starts to itch but who can resist good seafood? i pop my benedryl and keep on going into town with the salad.

1.0,9/15/2013,"My husband and I recently had lunch at STK in Manhattan and were sorely disappointed. We ordered the special of the day, lobster cakes, and after watching  the waiter put them down on two other tables before the made it to ours was a little disconcerting.  The lobster cakes were all cake and no lobster, it was all filler and very little meat, they must have tried to stretch the lobster from the lobster cobb salad the day before.  Next we ordered a filet which was okay but grossly under seasoned, something Tom Coliccio seems to be fanatical about, I was looking forward to something that was seasoned perfectly and would melt in my mouth but instead got a bland piece of meat whose texture was acceptable but nothing remarkable.  The parmesan truffle fries were fine, they left a salty coating in my mouth from what I consider too much parmesan.  All and all our experience was very disappointing, the $165.00 we spent on lunch was a waste of money, the food left much to be desired and the service was mediocre at best.  Tom Coliccio needs to spend more time at his own restaurants and less time judging other peoples food.  After eating at his restaurant I can't take anything he says seriously on Top Chef.",0,0,0,Liz S.,"Saratoga, CA",1,15,0

I felt completely taken care of and unafraid to make requests--for a trendy, upscale restaurant, it is markedly devoid of pretension, which I loved. Jenn went above and beyond to make sure everything was to order, and even threw in an upgraded dessert to compensate for a painful surgery recovery process that she identified with.

1.0,8/15/2013,"Avoid the Gilt City promo- it's a waste of time and money. My husband and I were excited to try a new (and glamorous) steak house- being big fans of Wolfgang's and Striphouse. This seemed like a nice deal (2 apps, 2 drinks, a steak to share, 1 side, and ice cream) for $120 + tax and tip. We arrived and were promptly seated by a very nice hostess, great. Our cocktails and wine arrived quickly but our waitress obviously had trouble hearing us over the LOUD Bon Jovi and Journey bumping through the speakers over our heads because our order got mixed up. We had to move tables before the apps arrived since ours was off-balance and I didn't want my drink to end up in my lap. Apps arrived, tuna tartar  with avocado was fine and the other one was wrong- we sent it back and she was very apologetic. 10-15 mins later the replacement app arrives, scallops, beautifully cooked but in a sauce that tasted better suited for a desert, some impossibly sweet white vegetable puree with roasted tomatoes. Pretty but not that tasty. Hearts broke when our main finally arrived about 15 mins after that- porterhouse for 2 with creamed spinach- it was COLD. Like, colder than room temperature. It had clearly been sitting for a time and was served on a cold plate. I have never been to a steakhouse that didn't serve fine cuts of meat on HOT plates- that's really the entire point right? Came with a tiny sliver of pickled red onions (about 5 cents worth) and two mini ramekins of sauce- the au poivre was just ok and the chimichurri was tasteless herbs floating in oil. Pass on that. So we kindly let the waitress know that cold steak was not going to cut it, again- she was very accommodating and I think must have gotten reamed out by her boss since when she returned to the table she looked pretty upset. 10 minutes later the replacement arrives, along with a replacement spinach (nice but not necessary, it was too buttery and salty anyway). The steak is just warm....this time....but we are hungry and can see that this is a losing battle- won only by the overweight, balding, finance guys with their 25 year old Match.com dates paying full price for warm steak. So we eat the entire thing, have another glass of wine, eat half the ice cream (which was definitely not made in house) and get the check. We tipped her well....and were surprised that the mgmt showed no interest in these issues. Maybe a comped glass of wine? What we were drinking certainly was not expensive and the glasses were under poured. Overpriced, over-hyped LOUD with a club atmosphere. Pass!",1,0,0,Katherine B.,"Brooklyn, NY",4,34,0
2.0,8/14/2013,"STK-Midtown.....yeah... not that great. It's Restaurant Week so I'm trying to go on some culinary adventures to places I can't afford to normally. If they are good enough I'll come back and splurge. That's my idea of Restaurant Week anyway.So I kept hearing about STK, STK, STK so I'm like cool it's on the list let's check it out. Made a reservation for lunch at 1:15 today. The décor is absolutely gorgeous and I would love to have a large function here just from an aesthetic perspective. The host was pretty cute (in a male model way if you like that sort of thing) and led my friend and I to our table. Perused the lunch menus and after 20 mins our waiter finally came over to take our order after my friend had to wave him over...hmm I said to myself. He has 12 tables I see but 20 mins? I order the heirloom tomato salad, steak frites-medium, and it comes with a trio of sorbet. Friend ordered the same but with the Caesar salad starter & supplemented with the creamed spinach. We get our complementary bread and it was delicious and soft and spot on to the reviews. 10 mins later our salads come out. (Let's note that they were brought out by the ""assistant"" / busboy / water guy as our waiter was wandering around our section not really doing anything). His Caesar was good. My tomato was tomatoes and cheese w/ some arugula and a breadstick. Not particularly inventive or overly delicious. 20 mins later our entrees come out (again brought by the assistant/busboy). Steak was a small portion (6 oz) but the chimchurri sauce and onions made it tasty. The shoestring fries were good though a bit salty. The creamed spinach was not good. It had a bitter taste which I couldn't figure out and was more runny than creamy. At this point there are about 4 tables left in our section... 20 mins later our waiter (and busyboy) come to clear our plates and give us the check. Now my friend is annoyed because our waiter has barely been attentive the entire period. So we speak to the manager, Ricki, and my friend voices his opinion. Ricki is very apologetic and seems genuinely concerned that we didn't have a glowing experience so she goes to get her business card to give to us. In the meantime, our waiter has so generously brought the sorbets to our table. These were actually the best part of the meal. Really creamy and full of fruit flavor and the mix of the coconut, mango, and raspberry? worked very well together. Ricki comes back to our table w/ the check and has generously applied a discount and hopes that we shall return. Me... I'm not so sure I will. I'd almost be willing to come back if the prices were befitting the level of food or service which they clearly weren't in this case.

5.0,8/9/2013,"STK Midtown is an experience that everyone should have. From the excellent wine (thanks Jay) to the awesome DJ cranking out songs you know every word to. Our server, Cameo, was excellent and catered to our every need. The restaurant was very crowded from the time it opened to the time we left 3hrs later- and for good reason. We ordered the beef tartar and the foie gras French toast for appetizers, but accidently were brought the tuna tartar. As my companion put it, it was the most delicious mistake. Upon bringing it to Cameo's attention, she quickly went to the kitchen to get the correct dish and allowed us to enjoy the tuna tartar on the house. Although our entrees took a while to arrive, we didn't mind one bit because of how much fun we were having. The steaks here are fantastic and cooked perfectly to temperature. As the last donut was pulled from the bag, we thought our experience had come to an end but SUPRISE! Waiters appeared with sparklers and a tray of lemoncello shots! What an evening!

4.0,8/6/2013,"Bread: Dinner rolls with parm and butter, and this green aioli sauce. I ended up slathering the green aioli over everything. Can't get over that herb aioli. I wasn't a huge fan of the bread simply because it tasted... half-stale? It wasn't as soft as I was expecting for a dinner roll. Anyhow.Appetizers: Hubby ordered their sliders, which were *super tiny* but packed with flavor, and very juicy. Too bad they were the size of two bites, and the hubby ended up having another round of dinner rolls. I had the tuna tartare AND the seared scallops (hello seafood heaven.... eating on a giltcity voucher meant TWO fish apps for me!). Tuna tartare was fairly bland tasting with the avocado. The soy sauce it came with was tasty but needed more sodium. Seared scallops were perfectly cooked, soft and dissolving in your mouth. None of the rubbery texture that I've had at other places, and full of flavor.Main: Steak! We ordered it medium, and it was quite enough to share with a side of Bearnaise sauce (in hindsight, if I didn't have 2 appetizers, I'm not sure if I would say that the steak was big enough for the two of us). As side dishes go, the mac n cheese was solid fare, and the parmesan truffle fries that were stacked like Jenga blocks were tasty, if albeit a bit dry from being, well, a form of starch. It was weird though, like they were blocks of yucca instead of potato (okay, who cares, they're both starches, I know, but seriously, I would've pegged them for yucca fries if I didn't know better).Dessert: miniature ice cream cones! Definitely delicious. My husband loved his sprinkes (or was it M&M's?) and the cookies n cream cone. I had the rocky road one. All cones were filled with this rich chocolate mousse in the bottom, with a melon-ball sized portion of ice cream perched on top. Tasty? Yes. Well proportioned? No.Water service was good, specialty cocktails are tasty too. Hubby had the White Orchid (which smelled a bit too much like kitchen cleaner for my taste), and I ordered the Strawberry Cobbler which was nice, especially because of the graham cracker rimmed glass. Very tasty.Good food overall. I enjoyed this much more than some of the other trendy-nightclubbish dining establishments I've been to. We went in the early evening (6p) so there was none of the rubber necking and night-clubbish sound/atmosphere that makes it impossible to have conversation.

Constant picture taking by girls to post to instagram to say that they were there, etc. Might sound bitchy, but I tend to judge a place by the amount of people you see taking pictures of their food. There was a lot of that nonsense going on. We enjoy nights out often and like more intimate environments where we can forget that there are other people around.

I would have preffered to pay 60 and get a protion that was larger than an appetizer course.I seriously think my halibut wasnt even 4 ounces.  I thought big plates and small food died out years ago.The Pinot was great and my friends steak was good as well but the cow it came from must have been famished.The biggest let down was the service. our waitress was pleasant enough but when she realized that we were not having dessert she didnt offer coffee, she just brought the check without us even asking for it. In addition they cleared our wine glasses and settings without so much as asking us if we wanted an after dinner drink. So the 2 of us paid our $400 tab and got out (rushed out) of there in less than and hour and 10 minutes. by the way we had reservations.",0,0,0,Nick H.,"Bedford Hills, NY",0,3,0
3.0,4/20/2013,"Let me start with the food ... The food is excellent; however, the atmosphere kills it. I went with a friend. We go out once a month to get away from life, talk about what is happening, and have an adult beverage. The issue with STK Midtown is you cannot talk. The Music is SO loud that my friend, who is a short table's length away, can hear about 1/3 of what I am saying. The music seems pretentious because it is supposed to be a Steak House; however they have a DJ. This DJ does not know his craft at one point he mixed a song by the Archie's, with a song with Rihanna.   The scene here is 20 somethings. My friend used to own a music shop and he had to tell me who sang that song. I doubt any at the bar knew it. Finally I think STK Midtown is trying to do too much. It really has a muddled identity. I cannot figure out if it wants to be known as a dance club, an after work hang out joint, or a steak house?",1,0,0,Michael N.,"Brooklyn, NY",34,71,60

Unlike other steak house, it's got very modern decor, younger nicer looking crowds, more importantly the steaks are also very good. Could be a little pricy but it's definitely worth it.

We were slightly disapppointed with the Strawberry Rhubarb cake (BF loves rhubarb and you don't see it that often) bc it didn't have enough strawberry/rhubarb.

3.0,3/14/2013,"I was underwhelmed.I know that most people that frequent any STK locale is preoccupied with the scene. However, as a foodie, I'm more concerned with the food,which is ultimately how I'll make my judgment call as to whether to ever frequent again. Came here on someone else's dime (post a friend's speaking engagement) lol and ordered a cocktail (an interesting gin-based take on the mojito), strip steak, mashed potatoes and mac and cheese. The garlic bread (#divine). The sides were delicious, but the steak was almost inedible. It may have had something to do with the fact that I ordered mine medium and usually I order it medium-well. Poor life choice. It was so late and I was so mentally taxed that I didn't event feel like sending it back. And so the beautiful struggle began, literally.I struggled to even cut the steak with the steak knife provided. Chewing was even more of a task. It took forever to eat what I managed to. Took the rest home to have the next day. Heated it up in the microwave and it shrunk....I just can't.

3.0,3/8/2013,"Just around the corner from my office, STK always struck me as a place that caters primarily to people eating on the company's dime. I've been here for drinks a couple of times and while it is a nice spot and the champagne is deliciously bubbly, it's not quite my scene. Most of the people here are in work clothes and in their 30's. There is a good amount of seating and space though, perfect for large gatherings of coworkers.I came here for lunch a few days ago with a few coworkers and my opinion of STK did not change. The bread they gave us before the meal had nice presentation (essentially challah like bread baked into a souffle dish drizzled with white melted cheese on top), but I didn't care for the flavor. It tasted too much like goat cheese, though it was soft and obviously fresh. I had the Jumbo Lump Crab appetizer, which was light and good. The melon and grapefruit added a particularly nice touch and the crab meat was flavorful. Definitely the highlight of the meal. I also had the Black Sea Bass lunch entree, which was well-cooked, but nothing close to mind-blowing. While the food was decent, it was definitely overpriced.

The music is average but I could tell at night it gets pretty loud at night.For restaurant week, you get a 3-course meal for $25. I had the salad which was literally just a plate with a huge piece of Romaine lettuce (no tomatoes or anything) lol. It was ok; I'm not a salad person. Then I ordered steak (medium) with well done french fries. But I actually got a well done steak. No biggie because it wasn't burnt. The steak was nice and long, juicy and really tasty. The french fries were sooo good I ate it all, ahhh! There was also an option to pair your meals with wine ($16) but I just had water (a lot cheaper and I was on my lunch break). My friend had the soup, and steak. She enjoyed her meal as well. For desert there was only one option: sorbet. The plum/purple one was the best.

And it is much quieter during the day so you can entertain clients. And I do give a thumbs-up to this place for the warm bread that comes in a metal tin straight from the oven.However, I tried the skirt steak ($24) for a 6oz. I ordered it medium rare and it was served tough and well-done. The creamed spinach ($9) was poorly prepared. Although well-seasoned, the cream as rather watered down. The burger was OK and did come a nicely toasted brioche bun, but once again they messed up the grilling and served my medium burger as well-done. Service was good and our waitress was sweet and attentive. But for the price I paid, I expected much better from STK. Turn down the heat on your grill!!",2,0,1,Annabel A.,"New York, NY",47,161,0
4.0,12/21/2012,"87/100Flavor: 9The flavor here is pretty much ALMOST perfect. I think what drops it one point from perfect is due to the quality (which I address below). Seasoned nicely, nice full flavor, and cooked close to perfect (a slight bit of bleed-out, but nothing serious). The bone-in rib eye is delicious. I ate every bite. Even the fat was, for the most part, really yummy. One or two spots were a little tight, and the fat cap was a bit on the small side, but still - a very tasty meal. The steaks even come with two complimentary sauces. I chose the blue butter and the horseradish sauce. The horseradish sauce was the big winner, and it was similar to the cream served with our oysters. When it comes down to it, though, I barely used either sauce. Not necessary with just good tasting meat.  Choice of Cuts & Quality Available: 7The selection here is great. On the regular menu they have two types of rib eye: bone in, and cowboy (differing mainly in size). They have a porterhouse for one, and two sizes of filet. I didn't notice a solo strip on the menu, otherwise that covers the basics. In addition they also have some braised beef, which is nice. The only draw back is that the steak I had was a bit tight in the main part of the cut. A little tough, or grainy. I think that has to do with low intra-muscular fat, or marbling. With more of that, the meat becomes more tender and flavorful. Perhaps some more aging is necessary.Portion Size & Plating: 8At 20oz for the rib eye, 24oz for the porterhouse, 34oz for the cowboy, and 10-14oz for the filets (boneless or bone-in conundrum filet), the portion sizes are nice! The sides were a bit on the small side, but our waitress Katheryn alerted us to that and recommended we order two sides instead of just one.Price: 9Prices are fair. Our steaks were $49 a piece. Not cheap, but not pricey either. use your own judgment regarding flavor and quality ratio for the price. I, personally, probably won't come back, given the other places I've been to, but it certainly isn't a bad meal at all. The martini was $15, also average. Sides were a bit hefty at $12 for a relatively small portion size. They were tasty though.Bar: 8The bar here is pretty cool. There are two bars, actually; one toward the front of the restaurant, and one in the back. I had a drink up front: the bar is a nice white marble counter. They serve a nice martini, and there is a good specialty cocktail menu too. I don't think I'd hang here often after work, but it is a decent joint for a drink. Specials and Other Meats: 10On special there was escargot for an appetizer, a boar chop and porterhouse for two for entrees, and lobster mac & cheese for a side. As far as other meats go, there was plenty of duck on the menu, some pork, chicken, lamb, and braised beef. Not too bad. They offer a $65 price fix deal too; four courses. but it is probably best to pick the fish entree, because the steak entree they offer is a measly 4oz filet. TINY!  Smaller even than Shula's! Apps, Sides & Desserts: 10To start, we had a dozen oysters, which consisted of half east coasters and half west coasters. Both were mild, creamy, crisp, cold and delicious. They came with a really amazing light, airy horseradish cream. For sides we had sauteed broccolini and creamed spinach, of course. The spinach was low on cream, which I like. Very tasty, though a bit salty. The broccolini was perfect; firm but juicy, with a slight char, and accompanied by some crisp fried onions. For dessert we had the bag-o-donuts (Ayyyyyyyyyy... Fuhgettaboutit!!! You fuckin' FUCK!). They were MINT! They were filled with a nice cream sauce, and came with jelly dip. COME ON! Perfectly fried.Seafood Selection: 8For seafood there was only tuna and a market fish (which I didn't catch - BUDDUM TSSSSSSSSS). Plenty of shellfish and raw bar selections, with three sizes of seafood platters available. Service: 10The service was great! Our waitress Katheryn has been in the business a while, and it showed. She was helpful, attentive, and gave us the perfect amount of space and privacy to enjoy our meal. She was helpful with the selection of food, and answered all our questions about specials and menu items. The table bread was really nice: warm, fresh baked in a small cast iron pan, covered with melty butter. But the down-side --- served with a very bitter parsley pesto oil type of deal. It needed sugar or salt to cut the bitter. Ambiance: 8The ambiance was okay. It was a modern joint; not a traditional steakhouse vibe. High ceilings, elegant decor, lots of big glass floor-to-ceiling windows, etc. My friend and I commented that it felt like being inside of a whale; not a whale's vagina (San Diego), but a whale - like the mythic/Biblical Jonah.

2.0,9/15/2012,"Food:Mediocre food, every dish was extremely salty, and there was nothing special in the food. We had the chef's set which was a four course dinner. For the appetizer I took the beef tartar which was good, however not the best I have had. The second course I had the duck pot pie where the breading was more like a crunchy cookie and the seasoning for the pot pie was extremely strong and after going through half you can only taste the heavy seasoning. The main course we had to butchers cut which was wagyu beef. The steak was very fresh and you can tell the meat was a prime cut, however the way it was prepared was extremely salty and takes away from the flavor of the steak. The steak came with mashed potatoes that tasted like potato powder you mix with water (and you only mixed it half way). For the fourth and final course, I had the house sorbet which was the only item I finished entirely and would say was good (still not great)Atmosphere:The only reason why I am giving STK 2 stars is for the atmosphere. It was recently remodeled and I must say the decor and the feel of the restaurant was very relaxing. The DJ was not the best, however song selections was simply top 40 of early 2000 to 2012.Service:Simply put, our server was not attentive, we just came from the bar as we had to wait for our table so we did not order drinks at the table. Upon hearing we were not ordering drinks he immediately made a face and walked away. He returned to be extremely unhelpful. When asking what is better or what he would prefer he always provided the canned response ""everything here is great, nothing here is bad"". Clearly he was mistaken. The only time the service was fast was when the server went to swipe the credit card, he took the card and returned within 20 seconds.Bar: *****If this review was based on the bar I would give this 5 stars in a heartbeat! During our wait we went to the bar at the far end as it was less crowded. I was feeling a little under the weather due to biking around central park and the bartender was extremely attentive, made me a great drink, glass of water and promptly brought out some bread to try to help me feel a little better. The bartender was extremely attentive and gave us suggestions on appetizers to choose from as well which is very appreciated.All in all, for the price we paid the final verdict is simple: Not worth the value, I would rather go to outback as the flavor is better, however if I was to choose quality I would go to Ruth's Chris.",0,0,0,Vincent W.,"Brooklyn, NY",43,18,0

Keep that in might, and make sure you have a reservation or you will wait a very very long time. Service:  Overall the service was great. Our waitress was very attentive and no one ever went without a full drink or massive amounts of food. Vibe: Trendy, cool décor, very packed, very very packed. The crowd at the bar is meat market meets call girls. You can't tell if the majority of the women are 'working' there, but a good deal of people we meet/observed were on the line of green card hunters. The other portion of the girls were on the hunt for a sugar daddy. Get it girl get it. The men were well dressed, most likely well paid douche bags, with a few hotties thrown in there for good measure. Food Suggestion: Order lots of apps and sides to share Jumbo Lump Crab-- yummy, awesome bite w/lemon Smoked Buffalo tomato -nice fresh tomatoes, homemade cheese, tasty!!Tuna Tartar --great, fresh, good amount Lil' BRGRs - cute little bits of burgers :) nicely cooked Wagyu!! Main: Steak! DuhhhhhFillet -10 oz -nice huge cut, very little fat, Medium Rare, perfectly cooked Foie Gras as a topping on my steak?? Ohhhhh yes baby!! Huge amount, ummm umm good Steak Sauces: I like the chimichurri - nice fresh herbsLobster --yum! Yum! Yum! Me like butter Seared tuna -cooked perfectly nice flavor Sides: Lobster Mac & Cheese ---Incredible Brussel sprouts -not like your mama makes them, lots of flavor, great sauceTruffle fries --tasty, nice seasoning Mixed mushrooms-- magical shrooms??

She just kept dropping off napkins to the table so my friend could clean herself up. Unbelievable. We thought for sure the manager would be over to comp something from our bill but that never happened. It wasn't until we asked to speak with a manager that she was even aware something happened.

He got their medium sirloin with a bernaise sauce. Had asparagus & mac n cheese as sides. I highly recommend the mac n cheese. While we were having this fantastic dinner, the DJ seemed to play every single one of my favorite 80s songs, including Sheena Easton's ""Strut""! We didn't stop moving in our seats the whole time.

4.0,5/10/2012,"This is not your rough around the edges, sawdust on the floor kind of steak joint.  It's pretty much the polar opposite with its uber modern and upscale decor.  The old cliche saying ""you get what you pay for"" really applies here, because with the exorbitant prices you get a beautiful and eclectic interior, beautiful and eclectic food/drink, and beautiful and eclectic people.  The strawberry cobbler is an brightly colored drink and the graham cracker crumble around the brim of the martini glass is genius.  If you can get over the girly look of this drink, it really is quite delicious and creative.  Located in The Grace building, I came here with a couple co-workers on a Wednesday evening and the bar area was packed to the brim at 6:00pm.  It was mostly filled with banker types in suits, probably due to its proximity to BofA's offices and other financial institutions.  Fortunately my friend had the hook-up and was friends with the manager, so we were promptly seated at one of their cozy booths for 3 without a rez.  Man, the world is really all about who you know. The food was actually pretty solid and our server was extremely friendly and attentive.  The complimentary bread they bring out was off the chain!  It must be baked in house, cause it comes in this flower like shape that facilitates you ripping off a pre-buttered ""petal"" and dipping it in this flavorful cilantro or parsley and oil dipping sauce.  It was so light, airy and moist that I wished we didn't order like gluttons because I would have gladly polished off every last piece.  We started with the shrimp cocktail, three wagyu sliders, and the tuna tartare. The shrimp were huge and I liked how they took the shell off all the way to the end so you can savor every last piece of these bigass shrimp without fighting any exoskeleton.  The sliders were melt in your mouth quality American kobe beef and came on a glossy and perfectly browned sesame seed bun.  The tuna was also well executed with an Asian flair, served with a soy honey emulsion and avocado, all brought to your mouth on a crispy taro chip. For our main courses, we ordered the special porterhouse for two and the Bonito Crusted Big Eye Tuna.  For sides we got the broccolini and the lobster mac and cheese, which came with a half lobster tail in the shell just chillin on top of this wonderfully creamy and crusted M n' C.  The porterhouse wasn't Luger's quality, but it was damn satisfying and I feel that beef in general has a pretty narrow band from the worst to the best when it comes to these high-end cuts.  The tuna was a nice kicker, but the porterhouse was the real star here.  I highly recommend the STK bold sauce to give your steak that little something extra. An unexpected surprise came at the end with a dessert sampler and these puffed pastries which came with a vanilla custard and another type of dipping sauce.  I was fully induced in a food coma at this point that the details are hazy, but it was a deliciously sweet end to an over-the-top meal.    The bill was pretty outrageous, especially with the three Macallan 12 neats I got for $17 bucks a pop and the lobster mac and cheese at $39.  But this isn't the type of place you come to without expecting to drop some serious coin.  So come prepared to make it rain, and if you do you'll have one of those upscale, she-she kind of nights that only a city like Manhattan or Vegas can give you.",2,0,0,Eric H.,"Wilton, CT",581,169,1530

The first time I came ""early"" for a work function and a bunch of us wanted to order some appetizers to pick on while were having drinks by the bar. They said that the kitchen wasn't open and would take orders to serve us when the kitchen opened in an hour. Unfortunately, they failed to realize their celebrity guest was being served food. Uh huh.The second time I walked in with a friend on a Tuesday evening around 8:30pm for a table. I was told that they had no tables available and that if I put my name down they will come look for me at the bar. We had drinks till around 10:30 and decided that they either they (1) did not attempt to look for us or (2) did not realize we were at their 2nd bar in the back. It's your restaurant! I hope when you say bar you realize there are two bars you should check!?! Irregardless, it was getting late, we lost out appetites and decided to just not bother and give them a pass. Maybe it was just some missed communication. Today I decided to meet my Fiance and sister (who was in town for the day) to have a lunch before it was time for her to depart. We came in and was sat. We waited for a waiter for a while until the manager came by to take our order. After the order was taken we were provided bread for the table and our salads. The salad was very good (that's why I gave them 2 stars!) We waited for another 40 minutes for our entrees before we started asking for it. We noticed other people getting seated after us were served their entrees! I understand restaurants aren't fast food places but it is during lunchtime and we were giving them the benefit of the doubt before getting anxious. Anyhow. After more than an hour we had to ask them to pack our food to go. Unfortunately the sister was going to miss her bus.

We arrived a little early to grab a cocktail and look over the menu. But i must say the first thing we noticed as we walked in was just how sharp the restaurant looks. We both kept saying to each other "" this place is really cool"".The hostess was pleasant and seated us just as we were finishing our drinks, which were priced decently for an upscale restaurant in NY. When it came time to order our server was very helpful and knowledgable with the menu items. He recomended the lil' Burgers which were really tasty. My girlfriend loves tuna tartar and was very happy with it as her starting course. As for dinner my 14oz bone in filet was delicious, cooked perfectly the way i like it (medium/rare). My girlfriend was very pleased with her 10oz filet, also cooked just right. As for our sides we chose asparagus, sweet corn pudding, and mac & cheese. All of these sides dishes were very tasty, but the corn pudding was our favorite. We were fighting over it towards the end of the meal. It was just something different that was prepared so well.We say... GET THE CORN PUDDING!!For desert we chose the chocolate s'more since we are both fans of a good brownie, and boy was it good.

3.0,2/21/2012,"STK is more of a club that also serves decent food.  Not in the same league as Del Friscos, and probably not as hip as the other STK location downtown.  That being said, it's a fun time if you're with a group of friends, or want to impress a date by showing her how much money you can blow on a single dinner.  I went with a group of business partners, and we started off in typical wall street fashion by ordering a round of dirty martinis, and multiple appetizers.  The drinks, and apps were all above average.  I had the tuna tartare, which was slightly too salty, but very tasty, and presented well.  The oysters were fresh, and the blue cheese/iceberg wedge was simple but very good.  I originally ordered a 16oz strip steak for my main course, but the waiter arrived with a 10oz strip explaining that they ran out of the 16oz.  When I told him that I didn't want a 10oz steak, and to bring me something else he got flustered, and seemed upset that I wouldn't just accept something I didn't order.  After exchanging a few words, I ended up getting a 16oz ribeye instead.  I ordered medium with a side of STK bold sauce, I got medium rare with a side of bearnaise.   I tried some of  my friend's fillet, and it was actually cooked perfectly.  Everyone also seemed to really enjoy the sea bass, which I didn't try personally. The lobster mac n cheese was the clear cut favorite as far as side dishes went.  I would definitely come back with a group, but only if the scene is just as important to people as the actual dinner.  STK is alot of fun, but not quite in the top echelon of NYC steakhouses.",1,0,0,Mario F.,"Manhattan, NY",55,64,0

My bone- in filet was cooked perfectly and the array of sauces were nothing short of complimentary, with the au poivre the front runner. For sides - we did not skimp... the truffle fries + sweet corn pudding was decadent and delicious however just the right size for sharing. For dessert, the bag of donuts was clever and tasty! I would definitely recommend this place for both lunch and/or dinner",0,0,0,Natalie G.,"Manhattan, NY",0,2,0

2.0,2/12/2012,"What was ordered: Tuna Tartar, Seared Big Eye Tuna, Pomegranate Glazed Duck, Birthday Cake for dessert.For starters, everyone else's reviews are pretty darn accurate. Music was too loud. By the end of the night, I had a raspy voice having to yell at my boyfriend just to say a sentence. Before seating, I had a pineapple-vodka drink which was very good and my bf ordered  LI Iced Tea which was EXREMELY sweet. At the table, we had pull-apart bread topped with salted butter and served with a side of green mystery sauce: tasted like ikra (pink caviar) to me. No idea what the green oil was. The bread was a total FAIL. It tasted old, broke up like it was stale. The Tuna Tartar appetizer was the BEST part of the dinner. It melted in your mouth. It's served with plantain chips. Highly recommend this appetizer. My Seared Big Eye Tuna was definitely overpriced for the size - I downed it in like 5 minutes. And the butter inside the puree served with the tuna overpowered the taste of the tuna which was cooked more than I had wished for (medium rare). My boyfriend enjoyed his Glazed Duck, but would have preferred the skirt steak if they HAD ANY (they were sold out, HA!). For dessert - Birthday Cake: Nothing special. Hated the pink buttercream, but the chunks of caramel inside made it better. The buttercream tasted I accidentally got hair conditioner into my mouth.",0,0,0,Leslie A.,"Rego Park, NY",131,18,0
1.0,2/12/2012,"All the bad reviews are spot on. STAY AWAY from this cheesy overpriced excuse for a steakhouse.  We came with a group on a Saturday night (early 30's and love food and a good time) and were shocking to find a cheesy lounge/club filled with 40-something B&T clientele.  I don't know the last time I saw so many scantily clad older women in one place...was bizarre.  Food was fine but way overpriced for the quality and overall experience.  We wanted to split a couple of porterhouses for the table and they conveniently were out of the 24oz size and cajoled us into getting the more exp 32oz size at 105$ a pop.  I didn't hear my hubby agreeing to this or I would've surely stopped him - what a rip-off and a cheap trick!  And on top of that, food took wayyyy too long to arrive.  This place is an embarrassment to the NY city restaurant scene.",0,0,0,Marianna M.,"Manhattan, NY",111,33,0

Lots of middle aged bridge and tunnel types trying really hard to be cool. There was a group of women in their 40's that for some reason the restaurant management thinks it's super cool to let them dance on their incredibly expensive banquets to quite possibly the worst DJ I've ever heard (think Sweet Home Alabama, followed by Justin Bieber) The server said it happens all the time. It is expensive but we expected it, 6 people we spent almost 1k. A manager came by say 10 mins after we paid our check and told us they needed our table! He said he'd buy us a round of drinks for the inconvenience, apparently it was limited to some disgusting tequila shots...really? We spend 1k then you tell us to get the F. out, and you're too cheap to actually make good on your promise!",2,2,1,Chris W.,"New York, NY",0,8,0
1.0,2/4/2012,"What happened here?! My lunch experience here was so horrible, and nothing like my previous experience at STK in meatpacking.  We went for restaurant week and the service was a bit slow for a typical business lunch timeframe.  The mixed green salad was OK, and the dressing was the perfect mix of sweet and tart but they loaded way too much on... no one likes drenched leaves.  I ordered the burger and it was dry and flavorless beyond belief (I asked for medium rare).  Such a terrible burger, and the fried tomato on top did nothing for enhancing the excitement or flavor.  And the fries? I swear they bought them from McDonalds - identical and equally as pitiful. How can a steak place get a basic burger and fries so incredibly wrong?  I am so upset I spent money on this burger - I actually feel badly for anyone who orders one.  It's not going to be revolutionary, I promise you that!  Let's hope this midtown version of STK works out their kinks in order to be successful.",1,0,0,Ash C.,"New York, NY",72,301,6

3.0,1/29/2012,I went here for restaurant week. I'm probably not the bet person to review because I don't like steak.  However I got the mixed greens salad which had way too much vinegar for my Taste.  My friends got the romaine alas but it was literally just strips of unchopped lettuce with dressing on top.  I don't like to have to work for my food.  I also ate the organic chicken.  This was moist and flavorful and not bad at all.  All of my friends got the skirt steak.  They're extremely tiny.  I would never lay $29 for them.  Also one of my friends got theirs medium well and it was completely charred.  Now for the good stuff.  The decor is sleek and sexy.  Also the dessert was banging.  I had a smore brownie with peanut utter and ice cream.  It was a decent sized portion as well.,1,1,0,Katie D.,"Teaneck, NJ",154,121,43

2.0,1/26/2012,"STK Midtown is a trendy lounge masquerading as a steak house. Don't be fooled.No reservation? On a Monday evening, the hostess gave us a look of death as she looked at her appointment book, then told us to wait at the bar.Ironically, there were more empty seats here than a subway car with the smelly sleeping vagrant. Why the wait? Why the attitude?We sat down and enjoyed the trendy ambiance. The dining room looked cool but as we ordered dinner, everything was an upsell. The best part of my experience was the seafood platter. Expensive, but excellent.Sadly our steaks were overcooked. They were sent back and this problem was rectified but everyone one else had finished dinner by then. Fries were a jenga looking puzzle and were terrible.... truffle oil parmesan or not.Overrated. If you're going to charge Capital Grille or Del Frisco's prices, you better learn from them, execute and provide the grand dining experience. Not your daddy's steakhouse? Sure, but at least his was great.IFHTP 1",6,5,1,Peter K.,"New York, NY",342,478,2495

4.0,1/19/2012,"This restaurant is a touch of volume away from perfection.  I took my girlfriend here for her birthday after canceling previous reservations at ""the view restaurant"".  At STK Midtown I had a welcome feeling from the moment I walked in the door as I was greeted by the manager and staff...(i never had that happen before ever)  I explained that I was a little early for my reservation but they had no problem seating us a little early.  The waitress took her time explaining the menu and frequently visited to check on us.  We ordered the mini burger appetizer which to my surprise was cooked medium rare.  Ive never had a burger that way but instead of being turned off I figured, no guts no glory and I ate them!  To my surprise they were pretty good.  Very very tasty.  Also on our table was the very stylish truffle oiled fries.  They had a unique taste that I found quite delicious.  Dinner was lamb for me and skirt steak for her.  The lamb melted in my mouth.....i had it prepared medium.  Best lamb I ever had.  She had skirt steak which I tasted and I thought it was ok, simply because I'm not a skirt steak fan to begin with. However, it was very well prepared and (not) over cooked.  We finished the night off with a surprise, compliments of the manager himself.....champagne and a delicious ice cream treat.  They helped me make it a night to remember!  My only complaint would be that we ate around 6pm and the music was just one touch too loud and at times conversation with my girlfriend was a little difficult as she wasn't right next to me but across the table from me. So in summary STK Midtown is not your daddy's steak house, it's cool, it's new, it's fresh, it's a place I look forward to visiting again in the near future.  Oh yeah.....the bread thats served just before dinner must go.  I like bread that can make me forget about the wait for dinner to be prepared.....the bread made me wish dinner would hurry up after 5 minutes of waiting.  Get the bread right and win the people!   :-)",1,0,0,Cody H.,"JAMAICA, NY",14,40,80
3.0,1/15/2012,"Had heard about STK from a friend who lives locally and wanted to check it out.  We were eating before a show and decided on a whim to eat here... Accommodated us easily without a reservation, but it was just before 6:00. Interior  was modern and spacious. Good music but a little loud for easy conversation. For some... That might be seen as a plus!About the food.... Starters were pear salad, romaine salad, tuna tartare and beef tartare. Pear salad a little sweet to me, romaine pretty average, beef good, tuna excellent. Entrees were filet and duck. Duck was so outrageously good!!! Now I know what you are thinking, you're in a steak place, should you not order a steak? That was what I thought, I was wrong! The duck was hands down the hit of the night. Will go back just to order it myself. Filet was good too. Sides were asparagus and creamed spinach. Small portions, nothing special.One last observation, ordering was complicated. I asked for my steak medium rare and my waiter went on to tell me that they have a different system, something about medium plus, rare plus plus and on and on. Music too loud to hear what he was saying and seriously.... Medium rare... You know what I want, don't school me on ordering a steak!",1,0,0,JENNIFER T.,"Northport, NY",55,42,0
3.0,1/12/2012,"STK Midtown well it's a STK and its midtown so what did you expect Jersey, Eurocentric clientele extra flashy like and midtown commuters.  At any rate great location, easy access, decent interior design, good carnivore products, a DJ and a well crafted take out located outside.  Overhyped sure, expensive however creative drinks and the later it gets the better the eye candy gets.  The interior is that of the inside or a cow carcass or maybe its inside of a whale, the bartenders are mixologist and seem to be fairly attentive, the restroom is located downstairs, there is an attentive restroom attendant and a coat check yada yada.  Here's the deal you will drop dough if you go I have been here a few times after work for drinks and apps it was a decent time.  The D-Bag and Financial set will love this place due to the fact they are one in the same.  If you have an out of town guest that you are trying to impress they will also love this place.",0,1,0,Windell C.,"New York, NY",146,200,0
2.0,1/10/2012,"I'm going to come down kind of hard on this place because it deserves it.I spent last Friday evening at this establishment at the bequest of Aaron P. who, having his first birthday celebration in New York City since moving here, wanted to make a hella big deal about it. I often avoid restaurants this fancy because I find that, with all the hustle, bustle, and headaches that come with it, it just isn't ultimately worth it. Even though it was Aaron's birthday and I had a fabulous time with him and his friends, it was sad that this place kind of proved me right. It's here that you'll never EVER have more water spilled on you by a water re-filler man than ever before. They should provide towels. Seriously.The food was amazing, though. I'd be remiss if I didn't mention that. I got whatever the smallest kind of steak was (a 'baby' something) and got it well done (really, the only way one should order meat in this city). I also got a side of mashed potatoes, which may have been one of the top 5 best decisions I ever made. I've never had potatoes that good in my LIFE. The cocktails were strong, but at 20+ for each one, they better be.Our waitress was, for lack of a better term, stupid. She was constantly stressed out, and even rude to me when I asked her for a drink  while she took my food order (she told me she'd have to come back, then never asked me again). We were a group of 13, which granted is large, but was it her first day? She kept. Messing. Up. She should have had her crap together. She clearly didn't. On a personal note, spending that amount of money? I asked for their 'guest' wireless password. She wouldn't give it to me. F@#$ you, lady.Despite amazing eats, I would never go back here.

3.0,1/6/2012,"Ok having been at STK in Mepa I wanted to see how good this one would be. Bad experience #1 whoever the Hostess is said coat check was downstairs but then proceeded to seat us saying she would take our coats down for us. She never came back with a number ticket. ????? Like how are we supposed to get our coats back teh end of the night? Then in against their ""policy"" to go get our coats back for us ..umm just bring us the tickets! Did she? No. The poor waitress who was helping us couldn't get anyone to look at her or help her and that rude hostess was even ignoring her! So we ended up dragging all our bags downstairs to the coat check to get our coats back. Go back upstairs and sit down. Meanwhile we left our water and bread up there unattended. UGH! ok.... so already started out bad. FOOD The bread was just ok. The side dipping sauce was gross. The mixed drink I had was the stawberry muddled one. Eh was just ok not impressed for that price! Had the mixed green salad. That was good.Tuna tartar decent... amazing? No. Filet 6oz I asked for medium rare it came out mooing at me. I'd stick with medium nextime. The side sauce I forgot which one I had started with an A was bland. Steak itself was just ok. Maybe I shouldve gotten a topping added but I didnt want to spend the extra 6 bucks LOL The cream spinich had no cream! I wouldnt get that again. maybe Id try the potatoes instead.The layout of the place is stupid. I hate the decor.. but that doesnt really matter. What sucked was the bar spilled over into where people were eating. I think everyone just wanted drinks at the bar cuz that was PACKED!!! Like 4 deep. Coat check is in hell. Its all the way downstairs.. just seemed inconvienent that you need to walk into the whole restaurant to drop your coat off in the basement. LAME. ALOT of SUITS... Music I think started up good around 7pm. That was good. Overall... had a rough start. Ended ok. But for 164 bucks I expected ALOT more. Yes I'm picky BUT I tell the truth. I think this is just gonna either be a bar scene OR good for a date BUT it was loud in there we had 2 sets of girls on either side of us. OMG couldnt hear a thing my guy was saying. I wish the staff was more organized and helped there own. The poor waitress was running all over the place and seemed uninfomed. The hostest was a joke.

On the contrary, I think the food there is great and on par with any other respected steakhouse I have been to. To start, they bring you some complimentary monkey bread which was moist and delicious. There was a subtle hint of bleu cheese flavor on the top and it was served with a parsley dipping oil. I preferred it with just salted butter, but it was still good regardless and a nice way to start the meal.For the appetizer we split the Foie Gras French Toast. This was okay, but not as amazing as I had hoped. The foie was a bit on the dry side and the pairing of the foie, toast and apple was just not cohesive. The main course definitely did not disappoint. My grilled skirt steak was perfectly seasoned and cooked to the right temperature (medium rare). I opted for the small portion and it was perfect. We ordered three sauces and the STK Bold was definitely the favorite. When they say bold, they mean bold! It had the perfect kick and really complimented the steak. The other two sauces were nice as well, but the bold was the best. Our sides were also nice. The corn pudding is a favorite of mine and I remembered it from the Meatpacking District outpost of this restaurant. It is sweet and creamy and the corn flavor is perfect. I could eat a whole bowl of this and I must say, I almost did. The creamed spinach was good, but not really memorable, and the mushrooms were in a creamy gravy type of sauce which was quite nice. Corn pudding all the way, though!For dessert we had the mini ice cream cone sampler and it was a nice small end to the meal. The rocky road was great and the vanilla was quite mild but tasty. The mint chocolate chip was a fail tho and reminiscent of toothpaste. It was more like spearmint chocolate chip and I was not a fan. Overall, though there were a couple of misses, and a couple of just okays, the good parts of this meal shined and I would definitely recommend it and come again in the future.

The small tables by the front, then the bar and then the large tables.A group of 5 showed up and asked for a table. the maitred' said that she will have to ask a manager since we didn't have a reservation. Not a problem right, the place was at least 60% empty, so we concluded that it was going to be a no brainer. They asked us to sit at the bar while they find a table, so we did and looked around and most large tables were empty, the small tables also empty..WTF Anyways after we ordered a few rounds we were seated. The food is good, not great, prices are wayyyyyyyy over exaggerated, portions are ok. A biscuit was 12 bucks. Cant say anything about the drinks since we got bottle beer.I get it, make people wait, so they can spend money at the bar, so you can look cool and keep appearances, but on a Monday night when you are empty and its 10pm. just sit people down and have them eat for crying out loud.

The space is beautiful, the ceilings are massive and the venue spacious, it's modeled after the interior of a whale.Cocktails here are unique, crisp, and potent. The best one I had was the Green Intensity - definitely check it out. I would come back here for that cocktail alone. It's got Grey Goose vodka, green chiles, basil, and lime juice. Its refreshing, spicy and addictive. For starters the crispy shrimp are excellent. The sliders are also delicious. I had fish for my main course and I don't think it is still on the menu, but my friend had an excellent steak - - which they are known for, so it definitely will not disappoint. We tried the birthday cake for dessert which comes out with purple frosting and sprinkles, and it tastes delicious.
