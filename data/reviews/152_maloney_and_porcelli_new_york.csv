5.0,4/19/2019,"This place is INCREDIBLE. This was the best dining experience I've ever had I kid you not. The weekly wine dinner is truly the best deal in the city. The staff is friendly, patient, and attentive. Best customer service in the city and incredible dishes and wine. The oysters and scallops 10/10.

3.0,4/10/2019,"As much as I love the place and the atmosphere, I have to say, I ordered a very pricey prime ribeye steak, medium rare. It came out medium at best, bordering medium well.  Disappointed. We are talking a $69 steak. They were responsive and offered to replace it, but 20 minutes later when my replacement steak came out my dinner companion was done.  Sorry, a high end NY steak house, you have to be able to do a Medium Rare steak.",1,0,2,Chris C.,"Placida, FL",46,528,1061
4.0,4/3/2019,"Great spot for a business lunch - be sure to make a reservation as it gets very crowded around this time! The food was really good. I ordered the ""hay stack"" salad with chicken (apple, walnuts, shredded cabbage, carrots, pomegranate). I wish the menu had descriptions of what was in the salads since I had to ask what was in most of them. I probably wouldn't come here on my own since it is pretty pricey but since the company was paying for it, it didn't matter. The staff was very friendly and it was convenient that they had a coat check as well! Again, great spot in mid-town if you are looking for a business lunch!",1,0,0,Morgan F.,"New York, NY",224,103,33
1.0,4/1/2019,"One of the worst meals or is the proper verbiage underwhelming meals I have had in NYC by far. Bone in Rib Eye was one of the most bland tasting pieces of steak ever, which is hard to do. Grilled Asparagus was over cooked and tough. Would recommend skipping this restaurant all together. The price for the quality of food is not worth it. Service was ok, not worth the 20% of the meal price.

3.0,3/13/2019,"We had the $85 all you can drink wine option with the appetizer, entree, and dessert option. AppetizerAlaskan king crab leg. Lots of crab but it came partially FROZEN. I can't taste the flavor let alone bite into ice hard meat.   Would have been much better if they had properly thawed out the king crab. Also who serves king crab with a side of sauces, it should be properly enjoyed on its own with lemon. The 16oz prime rib steak was good. The meat near the bone was the most flavorful, tender, and juiciest part. It took a lot of will power to finish it, but you can also take it togo if you want. A bit too charred on the outside.Black currant sherbet for dessert. Three large scoops that were delicious. Can really taste the black currant flavor.The wine we had was the La Segreta Rosso. Cheap, red blend that was light and easy to drink. Overall, loved the company more than the actually food itself. Free flowing wine always makes for a good time.

3.0,2/22/2019,"I finally made it back to Maloney & Porcelli recently, and it's been a place I have been wanting to revisit for some time. The last (and first) time I went, I remember vaguely enjoying the food but definitely enjoying the all-you-can-drink wine special even more...so I figured it might be best to return under more sober circumstances to see what it was like. The getup feels like old-school NYC, with a nice bar in the back that folks can sit around entirely to take in a drink after work or before sitting down for dinner. The drink selection isn't super-broad - a handful of the big-label beers and 'macro crafts', if you will, along with some pretty standard cocktails. Similar options are available when you sit down, although if you can get a seat upstairs, I'd go for that - I was there on my previous visit, and it definitely feels more spacious than being on the ground level, where many of the seats are underneath the upper level and thus feel a little more cozy (or cramped?). Service wasn't anything too special - again, pretty generic steakhouse.As for the food, I'd say that the steak was a tad disappointing in the end. I went for the dry-aged ribeye, and while the flavor was quite good - as well as the cooking of it (medium, which I prefer despite it not being what purists are a fan of) - there was way, way too much fat on the cut I was served. Eyeballing it, about a third of the cut was inedible as a result (at least for me - I hate trying to chew through fat)...a bit of a shame given that the actual meat on the steak was quite good! Of the entrees I sampled, I would say the whole dover sole (which was de-boned tableside quickly and neatly) actually had a very nice flavor to it and was quite delicious. The rest of the food was what I'd term pretty standard steakhouse fare, whether it be the appetizers (lobster meat that wasn't as fresh but still tasted good in clarified butter; lump crab meat that was definitely fresher and tasted quite good) or the sides that came with the main (sauteed spinach was solid; the French fries were a tad lackluster). The one bite I thought was quite nice (and might be off-menu...one of my guests had the inside scoop) were toasted garlic knots that were cut in half. I'm used to having the heavily-oiled versions at local Italian joints, but these were nicely-crisped and had a faint hint of the garlic and olive oil that I'm used to these being drenched in.I've been to better steakhouses in NYC, but for a place that is close to the workplace and will be a bit quieter than other spots (ahem, Del Frisco's) that are virtually impossible to converse at, Maloney & Porcelli is a solid choice for an old-fashioned surf and/or turf meal. Prices are a bit on the higher side, but this is NYC after all - so it's not anything you would not expect at a similar restaurant in this area.",1,1,1,Asuka N.,"New York, NY",371,1653,169

3.0,1/25/2019,"I'm being nice by giving them 3 stars to be completely honest.Everything was AGGRESSIVELY OK at best. Came here for restaurant week since it's just started. For a steakhouse, the steak was disappointing to say the least.  First course - Rock Shrimp Cavatelli. Was not too bad. It was basically a tiny serving of pasta with a creamy cheese sauce, garnished with tiny pieces of shrimp. My boyfriend had the Oyster Casino and he didn't think much of it. Second Course - Filet Mignon. VERY disappointing. I asked for medium rare. Skin was black and had to scrape some burnt edges off to get to the meat. Was actually reddish pink and looked right, but was way more chewy and tough than it looked. My boyfriend had the same and he had the same thoughts. It honestly felt and looked like it was just cooked way earlier and preheated for us to eat for that dinner.Third Course - Banana Cream Pie Ice Cream. Didn't take more than 2 bites. I wanted to like it so bad since I love banana cream pie. But this just tasted like plain ice cream that was mushed together with preserved artificial bananas. Boyfriend had the Apple Cider Donuts. Donuts were good but not great. Portion only came with 2 small donuts Sides - Ordered an extra side of Yukon Gold Potatoes in Gorgonzola Sauce. Potatoes were not seasoned at all and were barely covered in the sauce. On the bright side they had a nice crisp to them. But overall, not worth the extra $15 for a side dish. Would not come back here again. And DO NOT recommend for restaurant week.",0,0,0,Natasha M.,"New York, NY",0,3,4

4.0,12/21/2018,"My girlfriend picked this restaurant for us to dine at for my 30th birthday. We aren't from NY and had no idea other than what other Yelpers had posted to guide us here. We came into the restaurant as tourists on vacation and fell in love with the taste of the food. As newcomers, we quickly learned every dinner entree was in the $50-65 range. If you order a main dish you wont receive a side like a salad, potatoes or vegetable. Everything is ""a la carte"" as our waiter told us several times. If you want a side expect to pay around $14 (sharable size). The final bill for two people is about $200 with an average desert cost of $20 (no free birthday cake here). I really enjoyed the 8oz steak I ordered in the surf & turf dish. She ordered the thick sirion but liked my steak better. This place absolutely kills you with the cost inflation on thier food but it's juicy, high quality, flavorful food. Our waiter ran around from table to table the entire time we dined here. He rushed from customer to customer leaving us waiting for quite a while. We used open table off google to reserve a table on short notice with no issues. I can't compare this steakhouse to others in the area but I left thinking about how I just had one the best steaks in my life but also paid the biggest dinner bill I've had in a long time.",0,0,0,Ken K.,"New Port Richey, FL",42,94,252

I've experienced better service at chain restaurants - which is truly unfortunate. At surface level, it may sounds petty, but I struggled even to get a second drink. I watched another table receive water refills twice in the time it took for me to get served. The plates came and as the waiter ""escaped,"" I stopped him to ask for another drink. It came and my other glass was left there next to my new drink. After our plates were collected and we were read through dessert, we said ""no thank you, we're set to go,"" it took another 40+ mins to receive a bill (I had to eventually stand up and ask for one as no one was checking on us).

Even the gentlemen sitting next to us in the bar said the bartender was at the end of his rope. We then saw another patron at the bar get up and go to the manager. It was not fair to the manager to have to cover for this guy. On to the food. My steak was just okay. Not cooked to my medium rare request. The server seemed overwhelmed also.

1.0,12/15/2018,"I'd like to start by saying this place held a special part of my heart for several years. All of that came crashing down last Friday. My ex and I had our first date here. We have both moved on, but met for lunch here to catch up (innocently). They allowed a company to hold their Christmas party here during lunch. Whoever made that decision should be summarily fired. Either close the restaurant for the private party or make them hold it at night during the week. Not both. We ended up sitting at the kitchen bar. In a way it was fun to be right where the food was being prepared, but then again, not really. Because we saw EVERYTHING. * One guy who was clearly a regular was allowed to get plastered at the bar. He literally didn't move the entire time we were there and he was there before us. * One of the servers was yelling at the kitchen staff for things that were not their fault. In a place that has clientele like this, you'd think the servers would be above that. I will say I have huge admiration for everyone in the kitchen staff. They were working their tails off with the seemingly neverending orders coming out of the machine. * My burger came to me almost raw. I ordered it medium with very little pink. * We had to wait a lot to do everything. We were prepared to do that since it was supposed to be a nice leisurely lunch, but given the chaotic atmosphere (and that most of the people there were drinking and therefore didn't require waitstaff but the bartenders) how long we had to wait to order, get non-alcoholic drinks,have our dessert order taken, get the check, etc. was ridiculous. I wish things had been the same as the first time. In a way. I mean the menu hasn't changed in like 4-5 years. I get sticking with what works, but a little change can be good.

The ambiance definitely was that of an old school steakhouse but the menu was limited. To start my meal I was served warm breadsticks. The breadsticks were pretzel sticks and would have been better served as a roll. The entree I tried was salmon served with polenta along with a side of creamed spinach I got. The salmon was small in size and rather dry. The waiter asked my preference and when I told him medium I thought the kitchen staff understood what that meant, apparently not. The polenta was creamy but barely was served as what appeared to be 3 oz. The spinach was creamy but flavorless. This place was unadventurous indeed.

4.0,12/10/2018,"Note: Came in for Thanksgiving dinner. Great food, but a little too quick. We had reservations elsewhere for Thanksgiving but after walking by it a couple days before decided to change our res. Very glad we did. They offered their full menu on Thanksgiving plus a couple holiday plates on a condensed menu. The other restaurant was only a prix fixe which I wasn't super into. It was surprisingly not full in the early evening, maybe was busier earlier or later. We ordered two dishes to split, the Thanksgiving plate which was all traditional Thanksgiving goods and I got a nice prime rib. The Thanksgiving plate was a great mix of everything you'd want. The steak was a great size, cooked perfectly medium rare. I went with the wine they had open and were pushing and it was a solid choice to pair with the meals. The ambiance inside was great. It had a nice vintage upscale feel. Not the cliche ""hip"" everyone is pushing for with American restaurants, this one has a nice old school vibe. Perfectly lit, plenty of decor tidbits throwing you back to a different time. A well placed bar right in the middle which helps break up the space a bit. We had an old school booth on the side which felt a bit more private. There are some larger tables to accompany larger parties as well. The servers were ok, not super friendly, but maybe they weren't stoked to be working on Thanksgiving, or maybe not as happy that it wasn't packed. The only thing I'd ""complain"" about is that the food came out incredibly fast. I was actually surprised they cooked the steak that quickly. When you're spending $75-100+ per person, I think pace is nice. I don't want to feel like I'm in a chop shop being moved in and out. For example, we ordered, less than 3 minutes later we decided to get an appetizer, he said the steak was already on so they'd bring the app and other dishes out altogether. Ummm, ok, did you literally run back there?! Anyway, I'd definitely recommend. I'd be back, but having not been to that many NYC steakhouses, I feel obliged to check some other places out too.",18,8,14,Sean M.,"Dublin, CA",548,500,1129
2.0,12/5/2018,"**UPDATE** within 10 hours after eating a salad from this restaurant I got SICK AS A DOG!! I thought the alert on lettuce was over. Before dining here I had black coffee for breakfast and trail mix during the day. Nothing before or after dining here. I am not trying to attribute personal responsibility to the restaurant however, I called after I was feeling better no one called me back, hours later I decided to call back. I spoke to someone named Alex and I went over the story again and he said 'oh yeah we got your message I will tell the chef and have him call you back. His delivery was so dismissive this is what's upsetting. I do not want other people getting sick if there's a possibility that the salad or lettuce that they are using is causing illness. A more appropriate response may have been 'I'm sorry that this happened to you and I definitely will speak with my manager and the chef about this hopefully it wasn't our salad that caused your illness but we will definitely look into the matter' Etc.. or maybe it's just me!? Well 15 minutes later someone named Aaron called 'this is Aaron from_________, how can I help you?' Uh I don't want help! Again 'Alex told me about your experience _________' This is one example of what could be said. I didn't want anything I was just giving them a heads up. Probably a NYC thing!This restaurant decorated beautifully especially at this time of the year.  The staff was prompt, friendly, helpful and professional. Me and my dining buddy had a great upstairs view looking down on the entire dining room and lovely holiday decor. If found the menu to have enough options listed however nothing truly I spy. I went for the Crackling Pork Shank, it's basically a shank slow cooked with the skin attached then deep fried so the skin will crisp. The meat inside was tender an juicy but it lacked flavor. The sauerkraut u Dee the shank was flavorful as was the spicy apple sauce.i really enjoyed the Five Leaf House Salad. My friends salmon was very small and she was unimpressed with its flavor and the choice of one bread.

So of course me and the people I went all elected to go with that option.The pretzels and mustard butter they bring to the table was amazing because I've never tasted something as good as their mustard butter.-For my appetizer I got the giant shrimp cocktail which was 4 huge pieces of shrimp served with 2 sauces.-For my entree I got the Crackling Pork Shank and one of the people I went to dinner with got the Prime Sirloin because we agreed to split each in half. I read so much about the pork shank that it was no way I wasn't trying it. Everything I read about it was true and it didn't disappoint in the slightest. It was the best pork shank I ever had from the perfectly crispy skin to the delicious and well seasoned meat. The sirloin was amazing as well cooked medium-rare to perfection. With dinner we had sides of creamed spinach and Yukon potatoes and both sides tasted good and are definitely big enough for table sharing.-For dessert I had the warm apple tart with vanilla ice which was tasty and a great end to an amazing meal.-Throughout dinner our waiter was always on top of things with keeping our glasses of wine filled without us every having to ask.I give this place 5-stars across the board and will 100% be returning because it's a cant beat deal with top of the line service and food.",1,0,0,Mark S.,"Queens, Queens, NY",10,158,258

It was completely soft. My friend got the red velvet cake which was totally dried out. Both desserts tasted like they had been on display for a week lol.

I have only been for their Wine Dinner special - after 8:30pm you can get almost any appetizer, entree, dessert and unlimited pours of wine (white, red, prosecco) for $85! And the food is actually really good! It's not the absolute best steak I've ever had, but it's pretty great, they cook it perfectly, and their food in general is really tasty. Their customer service is also fantastic. Their waiters are all extremely accommodating (and do not skimp on the wine pours at all), but their staff in general is excellent as well. Due to an unfortunate occurrence at Quality Italian (feel free to see my review for that), at 10pm this past Saturday we called Maloney & Porcelli to see if they could fit 10 of us in last minute, and they accepted us no problem, and we didn't even need to make a reservation. They were extremely friendly and welcoming when we came in as well... a completely different experience from the general customer service at Quality Italian. We were still there past closing due to our late arrival, and they did not in any way make us feel like we should rush to leave, and were very kind to us on our way out as well.

Definitely a steep price tag but you do get your money's worth since aside from ~bottomless~ wine, you also get an appetizer, entree and dessert! For our appetizers, my BF and I shared the scallops and the shrimp cavatelli. The scallops were so soft and well made, and the sauce it came with was honestly amazing. The cavatelli was delicious as well and surprisingly had a little spicy kick to it. For my entree, I got the Filet Oscar and was pretty underwhelmed. For starters, the kitchen accidentally made my steak well done instead of medium rare and so they had to send it back to the kitchen. Even when I got the actual medium rare steak, I wasn't too impressed. It was pretty dry and the fixings on top were too rich and creamy. For the dessert, my BF and I split the ice box chocolate cake and it was incredibly decadent. So rich and sweet, although by this point I was so full I could barely swallow anything.

We went here for dinner after an event at Radio City & although we got a table pretty quickly without reservations the overall experience was below satisfactory. The waiter took forever to bring us menus and bread. He rushed all the questions we had about that menu and the different steak preps as if he had somewhere else to be. Then the best part was our order was taking an extremely long time to come so they brought a pizza saying it was complimentary from the chef.  After 30mins our steaks finally came and not only was my 14oz Filet Oscar not what I ordered it was charred like a hockey puck when I requested it be cooked Medium.

3.0,3/27/2018,"First impression...the restaurant is quite dim. It's a romantic setting- but hard to read the menu if your eyes are bad. We were seated in the corner table. Immediately, I noticed that the chair is very uncomfortable. It is slippery and has no cushion. Or perhaps I just don't have enough of my own personal cushion. Haha! There is an old school/God Father/ Italian theme, hence the old hardwood chairs. Considering the price and the average 2-3 hours a customer spends dining, I believe comfort is important. We attempted to order a bottle of wine. However, our 1st selection was unavailable. Then our 2nd selection was also unavailable! The 3rd selection was the charm, I reckon. My hubby said it wasn't good though. D'oh! We ordered the shrimp cocktail. That thing was massive! Awesome and Yummy! I don't know how, but I must of gotten confused while looking at Yelpers photos and the printed menu. I proceeded to order the crispy pork shank. And when they brought it over- from afar, I thought it was a crab! I was actually excited hahaa! Thought I lucked out and they got my order wrong. But anyway, yes it was a ginormous crispy pork shank! Man, it was intimidating- scary! I didn't know where to start or how to start! WTH! The shell/pork skin was broiled so crispy that it was actually hard to even eat. It's like chicharrones but this was one super hard, it could be a weapon! It was cool looking though. I eventually got brave and cut the crispy skin off. Well actually, I opened it up- as if it's a shell. The meat was oven hot and tender. The meal came with a side of apple sauce. It was an interesting pair. The meat wasn't marinated enough, so I guess the apple sauce was support to be the dip? Not sure. The dish was ""aight"". I wouldn't order it again. It was much to ginormous. If I was closer to home, I would have taken it and turned it into pull pork! Seriously! But I was about 2500 miles from home. Felt bad wasting half of the pork. Dessert time and there's no cheesecake?? I don't recall ever going to an Italian restaurant that doesn't serve cheesecake...so we got the apple tart. It was ok. Edible but nothing spectacular. Overall, I wasn't too impressed with this place. I could go elsewhere and get the same food for much less and probably get cheesecake 2- and a more comfortable chair.",0,0,0,Roni K.,"Fremont, CA",34,159,698

1.0,2/13/2018,Came here for restaurant week and was very disappointed with the service have been to Smith and Wollensky and it was the exact opposite. We were seated at 630pm and did not get our apps until 740pm. Marcos our server was no where to be found. Our entrees def came out before our apps Bc the food runner looked at us bewildered and then disappeared with a cart. Must have been our food because my surf and turf looked like it died twice. My filet was charred and the lobster was dried out. They messed up in the kitchen and put all our entrees back under the heat lamps. Marcos didn't apologize he tried to make jokes which didn't make any of us gals giggle. He tried to fix it with a scallops app for two when we are four. Nice gesture but we wished it was a round of drinks instead. The food runner was more attentive. Lol We weren't even offered coffee with our dessert. We ordered sides and drinks it wasn't like he couldn't have increased his earnings. I can't believe took that long. I didn't mind because it was a girls night out. But won't be returning should be ashamed of yourself for ruining food and bad service. Not worth my money I'll go back to Peter Lugers.

4.0,1/25/2018,I checked out this steakhouse with a few friends for restaurant week. The ambiance is nice there were many people who were having business dinners as opposed to those attending for RW. The staff is great! The restaurant was packed but In spite of this they were very attentive and we were seating quickly. Now the food. I ordered from the standard menu as opposed to the RW menu. I decided to get the dry age meatball as an appetizer.A dry age prime rib steak cooked medium with whipped mash potatoes as a side. The meatball was flavorful and delicious as were the whipped mash. The steak however was a bit undercooked for my liking. It seemed to have been cooked rare as opposed to medium. Also the in house made steak sauce wasn't to my liking either. Unusually sweet for a steak sauce. So unfortunately the steak by itself was a bit of a letdown. For dessert I ordered the red velvet cake which was moist and delicious. At the end of the dinner our bill came which came out to approximately $400+ for 6 people (5 out of 6 were ordering from the RW menu). Overall I'll give this place a pass since the staff was amazing and most of the food was up to par in spite of my disappointment with the actual steak everything else made up for that.

4.0,8/12/2017,"Went by for an early dinner and sat solo at the bar. I was welcomed right away and the restaurant has a typical old New York vibe to it. I ordered the lobster bisque. Had a beautiful presentation and very fresh lobster. Flavors were on point. Still it just was a tad bland too. A slight kick upward on salt or spice might've sealed it for me. For entree I ordered the roasted carrots (a tad too sweet but LOVED the way they roasted them). I also got the roasted chicken entree. Again great prep with the crispy and juicy chicken. If the chef reads this, try thickening the sauce a bit. The sauce would be amazing with a more gravy like sauce texture instead of being so watery. Also, again, the chicken was a tad underseasoned. Just a slight amount more seasoning would've taken two of the dishes from a 7 to a 9. Fixing that sauce would take that chicken to a perfect 10. Great old fashions here too by the way!

4.0,7/28/2017,"4.5 Stars - We chose Maloney & Porcelli for RW because their menu had so much variety. The portion sizes were bigger than we thought it would be which is always a pleasant surprise. The shrimp cocktail was actually jumbo shrimp unlike some other places that say it's jumbo shrimp but then serve much smaller ones (size definitely matters when it comes to shrimp cocktail am I right girls?). I don't usually rave about salads but the tomato and grilled peach salad was so refreshing for a hot summer night, and it was also a good size. I would go so far as to say it was divine! I want to eat that salad every day at home as an entree salad with grilled shrimp or sautéed scallops! The grilled peaches had such a nice char flavor...can't stop thinking about it! Entrees wise, we had the prime rib, the scallops, and the pork chop. All were cooked to perfection. The only complaint heard unanimously around the table was that the cut of prime rib wasn't great, specifically that the meat was stringy. My mom had a piece that had a vein she couldnt cut through with a steak knife. The pork chop was a pleasant surprise. No one gets excited about pork chops but after having a bite of Maloney & Porcelli's I will actively look for pork chops on restaurant menus. Desserts were just ok, we were so wowed by the apps and entrees our expectations were raised when it came to dessert. Again, they definitely did not skimp on portion size, the coconut layer cake was a huge slice of the cake. I don't like coconut so cant really comment on taste. The Panna Cotta was fine and the Chocolate Ice Box cake was too rich for my liking. Still thinking about that salad...",1,0,0,Alice Z.,"Manhattan, NY",156,50,931

1.0,7/2/2017,"I don't know how this place can have such a high rating. Went a month ago, ordered 2 filets. One was ok-ish, the other burnt all over. Not just charred (although even that would be unusual) but blacked on the sides all around. It smelled like burnt barbeque. Meat spongy, flavorless, weird. The dessert and wine good. Ladies bathroom dirty, papers on the ground as if nobody cleaned it the whole night. After the dinner felt very heavy and rushed home.We went a week ago again to give them the Second Chance. What great people are we, right? ;-) I told them to be careful and not burn the filets. The filets came cold inside, spongy / chewy and flavorless again. I had to spit out a bit of fatty meat and didn't finish my steak. I would use that kind of meat perhaps for a stew. Felt sick afterwards and instead of our usual after-dinner walk with my man we rushed home to be close to the bathroom just like the last time after dining there. Thinking about it, even the mashed potatoes were bland and weird. Wine was good. But we go to steakhouses to experience great meat which simply did not happen here.We are not going back and waste further hundreds of dollars for a sub-par experience. After these two instances, we definitely prefer other steakhouses in NYC. I just don't understand what kind of steakhouse is this supposed to be.

I wasn't fond of the flavor either, it was my first time not being able to eat my entree lol. But my sister and father's steaks looked slightly juicer than mine.

5.0,6/16/2017,"5-stars for this amazing restaurant. We had a great time and trying to make the nightly wine dinners our ""thing"". We went 10mins before our reservation but got seated right away. This place is huge so it shouldn't be a problem anyway. We got seated upstairs that was lovely. They started us with some breadsticks (read chewy pretzels) and honey-mustard butter. I don't like any of them but my boyfriend devoured those breadsticks. For appetizers we had prosecco with the crabcake and the spicy sopressatta pizza. The crabcake came with grapefruit and avocado and was beautifully made. It was a riot of flavors. It went well with the prosecco. The pizza was one of the better pizzas I have had. It was the perfect amount of spice from the peppers and the shaved fennel complimented beautifully. I ordered the surf and turf for my entree and my boyfriend had the aged prime rib steak (it's huge; heads up). My filet mignon was done right. My lobster was grilled/ broiled (I'm not sure how you cook them) perfectly. It came with butter and a lemon slice. It was a delicious meal. The fact that the wine dinner costs you 85 but you can order anything off the menu (except the angry lobster and the porterhouse) is impressive. The prime rib was also done to perfection. Their dessert choices are amazing. I went for the apple tart that comes with a generous scoop of vanilla ice cream. Crisp, not gooey apple slices and delicious, creamy ice cream. My boyfriedn took the almond ice cream. They gave three scoops and toasted almonds as the garnish. While I took some red wine with my steak, I went back to prosecco for my dessert.

They kept rolling their eyes and covered their face with the menus making faces as if they didn't want to serve us. Little that they know that I also work in the restaurant industry, so I know that they were talking and mocking us to the other servers. Clearly pointing and having everyone look at our table and laughing at the service station was extremely obvious and unprofessional. They made us feel like we weren't good enough to be there, and that we weren't going to spend a lot of money, even though our bill was well over $400. The food was okay, not the best seafood in NY that's for sure. Their pretzels appetizer was extremely hard and stale, tasted as if it was 1 week old.  Sadly, Red lobster is so much better. Overall, I would not recommend eating here. The food was pricey for such mediocre taste and the staff were extremely rude and disrespectful.",2,1,0,Arianna G.,"Plano, TX",108,7,2

2.0,8/23/2016,"The food is pretty good and plentiful. However, it comes out too fast, at least at the ""unlimited"" wine tasting dinner. Big problem is the word ""unlimited"" has a clear definition, except at M&P, or at least under the guidance of our stern waitress. God forbid you ask for a refill while you are still eating dessert. We were told they were not supposed to pour after dinner. I pointed out that dessert was included in their definition of dinner, since it is part of the three-part dinner offering, and we still had plenty of dessert left to go. She then said they were not supposed to pour after the last course had been served. If they were going to define ""limited"" in that way,  they should damn well make that clear from the get go. No, we weren't looking to stay all night and we're not 20-somethings looking to get boozy at an all you can drink brunch; but grown-ups looking to enjoy a Friday night evening out. Enjoying wine throughout the course (and all the courses) of our dinner seemed like a reasonable expectation. She did (grudgingly) pour me another glass; my companion not so lucky. A complaint to the manager got us an extra glass. If we return, we will ask for better pacing. Also, some really tacky, loud people better suited to one of the nearby Irish dives helped diminish the experience. Restaurants -- not just this one -- are purporting to offer a certain kind of experience to guests, and at this price point they should try to create an atmosphere of civility and subtly underscore it. Otherwise, it undermines the experience of other guests. Restaurants should not be afraid to wean themselves from inappropriate guests. There are plenty of people willing to pay for the experience they have been ""promised.""",2,0,0,Patricia O.,"Manhattan, NY",2,47,2
5.0,8/19/2016,"Came here for Restaurant Week dinner and extremely delighted with the experience. We were seated in a section under Roberto and Emile and very lucky we were because they are phenomenal waiters. Our cups were refilled frequently and they weren't pushy for our orders. Starting off with appetizers, outside the RW menu, thick cut bacon was super delicious and moist, but highly overly salty. It serves maybe 3 comfortably, so 2 is ample for a large party to sample. Fries were disappointing, not worth trying, although one order serves 7. From the RW menu, it was shrimp avocado salad, bacon BLT, meatball with mozzarella fondue cover, heirloom tomatoes over focaccia. Bacon with the BLT was honey glazed and crispy. Meatball was large and rich with tomato flavor. The focaccia came with peaches slices, it was so refreshing. Overall, delectable and pleasant. Entrees were the delectable porterhouse, rib roast, and tuna. Porterhouse was so thick and juicy. Excellent size and sauce serving. Rib roast was tasty, although smaller serving. It was 2 thin-medium slices coupled with a nice slice of layered potato. Tuna was excellently seared plus coupled with tartar. Plus, adding in wine will add a low $8, bringing RW dinner to $50. Very worth it, Roberto helped with suggesting a savory white wine. Finally, dessert consisted of thick chocolate cake, coconut cake, and I pannacotta. The chocolate cake was so decadent, you need to let it rest in your mouth to appreciate the mix of chocolates and then appreciate the thickness. Coconut cake was light, fluffy, right sweetness, but the side of passionfruit puree was too tart. Pannacotta was perfect to close the night with its lightness and palette cleansing smoothness. Throughout dinner, Roberto and Emile were attentive. Although there were some hiccups with our orders, Roberto more than made up with it with complementary foods. We really appreciate the thoughtfulness, super thankful for the chance to enjoy plenty of food. Maloney and Porcelli is a definite place to return to enjoy high quality meats, exceptional service, and delicious desserts. We look forward to our next dinner date reservation, and will do so in Roberto and Emile's section. Absolutely splendid.",0,0,0,Kenny L.,"New York, NY",125,307,294

Immediately I noticed one thing.... the AC was broken on one of the hottest humid days in NY and it was dinnertime. The servers were extremely apologetic and offered us free drinks and were on top of refilling our waters that we kept drinking b/c it was just so damn hot. Appetizers - Ricotta flatbread. It was very difficult to cut and it tasted cold and bland. Slightly disappointed. Entree -  I ordered the pork. It was tender, and tasty.. BUT near the center it was slightly pink and when i accidentally cut the bone it was completely bloody... My friend got the prime rib steak and it was cooked to perfection. Maybe a little heavy on the garlic, but delicious nonetheless. However, i couldn't finish my meal as it was too hot to continue.By the time dessert came around I really wished I had ordered the panna cotta than the chocolate cake. I was sweating at this point. I had a few bites of my cake. It was ok, but not mind blowing. Overall the service was great, but I expected more from this place.

4.0,7/27/2016,"We went for Restaurant Week yesterday and were very pleasantly surprised. The RW menu was prominently framed in the window outside, and it was at the both place settings on our table. The portions for every course were large, unlike those at some restaurants that participate.We absolutely HAD to get the Thick Cut Bacon from the regular menu as a starter to share. It came with 2 very satisfying pieces of delicious bar bacon. A win for sure! Our waiter, Caesar was very helpful in answering questions about wine, and I had a glass of a California Cabernet Sauvignon for $8, while my friend had an Amstel. For our RW appetizers, she selected the Avocado, Shrimp Salad, Pea Shoots (great fresh citrus dressing!), and I had the Dry-Aged Meatball, Mozzarella Fondue (great quality meat and fresh parsley mixed into the salad was delicious!).For mains, I got the Berkshire Pork Porterhouse w/Fennel & Cherry Peppers - it was perfectly cooked and the basil and fennel flavors really made the dish pop. My friend ordered the Creek Stone Farms Rib Roast w.Potato Gratin. The meat was very tender and plentiful, but was a bit too salty for my taste.Dessert is the reason I am giving 4 rather than 5 stars. My friend's Chocolate Ice Box Cake was huge and dense, but not bad. My problem was with the Vanilla Panna Cotta w/Orange Sherbet I ordered. the description did not have any mention of nuts. When it arrived at the table, I  informed Cesar of my nut allergy and asked about the nut crumble. He assured me that he had confirmed with the pastry chef that there were ONLY ALMONDS in the crumble. Unfortunately, there may have been some cross contamination with Walnuts/Pecans (that I am highly allergic to). The dessert was delicious, but unfortunately, a few minutes later, the roof of my mouth and tongue started getting irritated and swelling. I informed the waiter to ensure that anyone else asking the same question would be able to avoid this awful ending!This otherwise, wonderful restaurant experience was followed by a run to Duane Reade and an immediate dose of liquid Benadryl while still waiting to pay for it in line!

Of course, staying at the New York Palace right next door made the decision easier, but it was my conscious decision after reviewing many of New York's finest venues. At first I was also considering some of the younger, modern decor filled places, but something in my gut told me that this is about quality. And quality should win all the time.Boy, was I right. The minute we stepped in, the hostess greeted us with a big smile, which made us feel good. She led us to a great table upstairs with the right lighting and distance from the stairs and the restrooms as I had requested. Now, enters Miguel - the man who guided us through our dinner to make it a memorable experience.Miguel asked if I wanted to look at their wine, some appetizers and what not, all without forever hovering or pressuring. His demeanor was professional and words were witty. He made my wife and I feel very relaxed, and enjoyable. And since he found out about our special occasion, Miguel treated us with a shrimp cocktail with lump crabs. It was so fresh and tasty. I had a feeling the rest will be all good that night.I went with a bottle of red wine from Napa, and enjoyed the complimentary champagne as well. The entrees that we ordered were also magnificent. I mean, I know red meat - and they knew what they were doing. My wife loved the small Classic Filet and I also enjoyed my larger steak. It was huge for a filet mignon. I already had close to 2 bottles of wine, bread, and shrimp/crab, but I had to finish it. Everything was amazing.As I mentioned, all of this good food and wine, even if the setting looks nice, would mean nothing if the person helping you with the experience sucks. In our case, Miguel just hit it out of the ballpark with his professionalism and brief but witty conversations. BTW, towards the end of the night, a couple got engaged on the first floor - the same night my wife and I said our vows. It made us laugh and smile.

5.0,2/10/2016,Great food for restaurant week! Great atmosphere and the waiters were fantastic. For appetizer I ordered the steak tartar and it was delicious. Interesting take with the potatoes underneath. My friend ordered the lamp for appetizer and that was fantastic. The crust was very crispy and the meat was tender and juicy. We ordered the aged prime rib and that also was delicious. The portion size was much larger than I expected. Finally for dessert. The coconut cake was out of this world ! I was going to order the panna cotta but I am glad I ordered the coconut cake. It was very light and tender and paired well with the tangy citrus sauce. Overall this restaurant was amazing.

4.0,2/7/2016,"**WINTER 2016 RESTAURANT WEEK REVIEW**For my Mom's birthday this year, we decided to take her out to restaurant week, which just so happened to end on the same day - so it worked out perfectly!The birthday girl wanted steak so when I was researching participating restaurants, I saw that Maloney & Porcelli had really good reviews. Plus their menu looked really good, so that's how we decided on this place.I made a resso through open table weeks in advance (since spots during RW tend to fill up quickly) for a Friday at 6:30. (FYI - if you plan on driving out to the city, metered parking starts after 6 pm. I saw this tip thanks to a fellow Yelper). It wasn't too packed for a Friday but did start filling up more later on.To start, they bring your table a little bucket of soft pretzel sticks with butter that has a hint of mustard (?). I really liked this because a) I haven't had soft pretzels in the longest time. b) they were warm and fresh. c) it was a nice change from the boring bread that other places normally bring out for you. I wanted to eat more of it but I didn't want to fill up on the food that was to come. And using the pretzel sticks as indication, I knew the meal was going to be good.For my appetizer, I had the parmesan-crusted Australian lamb chop with mustard seed & mint jelly. This was excellent. I don't normally eat too much lamb because most of the time, they have that gamey taste that I don't like. But this one was not gamey at all. It was cooked perfectly and the parmesan crust made the outside crispy. I wasn't a huge fan of the olive/tomato/cucumber salad it came served on top of but it didn't matter. The lamb chop was the star of the show anyway.For my main, I went with the prime rib roast with pommes Anna because what else would you order at a steak house?! (The seared tuna they had available sounded pretty good but I learned my lesson a few nights before when I decided to order the fish of the day at Delmonico's....don't ask..) For those of you who don't know what pommes Anna is, which I didn't until this night, they are layered potatoes cooked in a lot of butter and then baked/fried until they form a cake and the outside is golden and crispy. I had never even knew such a thing existed but I sure am glad Maloney and Porcelli introduced me to it! The crispiness went perfectly with the tenderness of the prime rib, which I ordered medium rare. It came with a beef reduction sauce on the side, which was just okay. In my opinion, the steak didn't need any sauce anyway.Finally for dessert, I decided on the vanilla panna cotta with orange sherbert. This was good too. If you've read any of my other reviews where I've ordered dessert, you'll find out that I'm not really a big sweets girl. But both the panna cotta and the orange sherbert weren't too sweet for me. One thing I should mention is that the panna cotta tasted more like a vanilla yogurt. I didn't mind it too much though.I should also tell you that during RW, they had a special where if you paid $48 (instead of the standard $38), you could get a glass of one of two wines they've selected. I really liked the entire experience I had at M&P. I read on their site that they have an $85 special for an appetizer, entree, dessert, and unlimited wine. Now that's my idea of a well-balanced diet!",1,1,1,Mel T.,"New York, NY",444,1319,3267

I had the Peekytoe Crab Cake which had lumps of crab, crispy and beautifully topped with micro greens. This dish was good, but I wish I had ordered the Yellowfin Tuna Tartare. I had a bite of the tartare from a friend's dish and it melted in my mouth. The blend of raw tuna on top of avocado with a savory sauce was delectable. For my entree, I ordered the Roquefort-Crusted fillet, medium rare of course. The blue cheese was a bit overwhelming, but presentation was fun! All steaks come with a pick with a potato chip on the top stating how the meat was cooked. I should have gone with the Dry Aged Prime Sirloin though, there's always next time!Dessert, I choose the red velvet cake. They really put this desert on a pedestal, all for me.

2.0,12/1/2015,"Quite disappointed with Maloney & Porcelli. I came here with my entire firm for our holiday party. We had the upstairs portion to ourselves with coat check, cocktail hour and a prix fixe dinner menu. I was pleased with the cocktail hour and hors d'hoeurves, with choices of lobster roll, mushroom pate, sliders to name a few. Dinner is where disaster struck. There were no vegetarian offerings for my friend and coworker, and she was served a mish-mash of side vegetables piled on a plate. She poked at it a few times and had it taken away.When I was ordering off the prix fixe menu and the waiter stopped to confirm, I repeated my dessert and he interrupted me saying ""stop telling me that"". I had hoped that was just an audible error on my part, but my coworker later on told me he had heard and was shocked that the waiter had said that to me. This definitely put a damper on my impression of the service.As for my food, I had the shrimp cocktail, filet mignon, and apple tart. The shrimp were plump and very tasty, and the apple tart was delightful as well. Unfortunately, the filet (medium rare) was a miss. There was no flavor and the sauce it was served with completely unappetizing. I ate half of it and did not feel compelled to continue.

However, they did accomadate our request to be seated in a booth instead so we were thankful for that.Overall the prices did not justify the dining experience. The waiter was nice but just there to do the job at the minimal level. He obviously cared way more about a family that sat next to us who were probably old customers. The pork shank was good but I would disagree with other yelpers who said this is the best in NYC. David Burke Kitchen makes one that blows this out of the water.

Now, repeat after me: ""I refuse to spend top dollar on dining experience and receive the worst imaginable service""My review isn't food related; the food was in line with my expectations, good, not great; But we came here with a company of 14 to celebrate a birthday of our dear friend which turned out to be quite disastrous.I must admit, I don't know the name of the waiter, the very same culprit that ruined our evening; it was an Asian gentleman in his late 40s - perhaps I go too far by calling him a gentleman.They sat 10 of us down while we were still waiting for our remaining four guests. It is fairly reasonable understanding in this town to expect some level of service before the entire party shows up, so we've asked this fellow to see the menus and perhaps get some wine and cocktails prior to dinner. This is the brief synopsis of the dialogue that went: A: ""I cannot pour wine until everyone is here""Q: ""I'd like to see the menu and perhaps order few cocktails; we didn't expect you to pour anything nor did we order wine yet""A: ""Why do you need to see the menu; like you don't know what you're going to order""Let me pause for a second and explain; we all have seen the rough-around-the-edges type of a waiter who is abrupt but means well and strives to deliver quality of service; this guy wasn't it; he intentionally went on to be rude an obnoxious for the next 10 minutes while we were speaking to his counterpart and maître-d to figure out the situation.As we learned, supposedly there is a wine dinner special that includes certain amount of courses and unlimited wine. Now it is all clear why this guy is being obnoxious, he is approaching out table with the expectation that we're here with some evil plan to take advantage of the special and potentially empty up their wine cellar. It becomes VERY clear that without our knowing he is implying that at a fixed rate everyone gets something expensive and there is no need for us to see the menu ahead of time and he isn't going to serve the wine before we place the order. I wouldn't go into further logistics of the nasty conversation that took place over the next 15 minutes but as you may imagine this attitude would ruin everyone's mood; instead of good quality birthday fun.Relatively eager to please maître-d took the position that we were NOT supposed to be treated this way and he will get us a different waiter who will serve us best. However, while we were introduced to a different waiter the other guy was still lurking around our table and assisting with bringing out our dishes. I'm fairly certain that he had one purpose that evening, that is to make our dinner horrible. I'm pretty sure he must've spat in our dishes or did something behind the scene to diminish our experience. Before this major rant gets out of control I'd like to address the management of this place.Dear sir/Madame, While you may not care about an occasional negative review, you absolutely have no idea of what's going on in your establishment. Your staff lacks training and most of all basic people's skills. Such experiences, as expressed above, directly reflect on your expertise and ability to manage a high-end establishment, which unfortunately isn't great.Please take an effort to show that you care and have an occasion conversation with your staff in hopes that no one again has to go through the similar experience in the future.As for me, I will never visit another Michael Stillman's restaurant again and go on to promote my experience to my colleagues and friends that visit so many of your restaurants in the NYC area and beyond.Be well, and take care.An unsatisfied customer.",5,2,0,Vadim B.,"Manhattan, NY",28,35,0

The lobster bisque was really good and had nice sized pieces of lobster. I sampled a filet that my wife had, and that's what I should have ordered. It was great and cooked as ordered.

3.0,8/3/2015,"My husband and I went here for restaurant week dinner tonight. We would definitely recommend this restaurant and this would have been a four-star review if it weren't for my husband's entree (more on that later) and our disappearing waiter, who didn't check in with us at all during our meal. Based on the other reviews I get the sense this is unusual at this restaurant and it didn't really bother us much, we just would have expected more attentive service. On the plus side, water glasses were refilled frequently. We started with the burrata, accompanied by toast and red pepper jam (we asked for it without the prosciutto), as well as the halibut gravlax. Both were excellent. For my main, I had the whole branzino with caramelized lemon, which was prepared perfectly - moist, flaky, seasoned just right...delicious. My husband had the prime rib, which was really disappointing. I know other reviewers have liked it, but he found it to be an inferior cut of meat -- very fatty (not in a good, marbled kind of way) and just not that tasty. And, while he ordered it medium rare, it was way more done than it should have been. It's too bad, for a restaurant known for good steak. Desserts were pretty good; my husband had the cookie assortment, which was yummy, and I had the coconut cake, which I would have like to have tasted more coconut-y but it was fine. We'd definitely come back - most of the food was really good and we just wouldn't order the prime rib again.",0,0,0,Amanda R.,"Manhattan, NY",0,2,0

Here is what we got: Shrimp cocktail - plump and juicy Meatballs - flavorfulHalibut gravlax - a little salty but melted in my mouth Entrees:Ribeye with lobster - ribeye was juicy & tender, lobster was cooked well Lamb shank - meat fell off the bones and very juicy. The mint julib added more sweetness than mint flavor, but was a nice touch. The cooked vegetables lacked texture and soaked up the salty juice, so was difficult to finish. Dessert:Ice cream and sorbet - mint ice cream lacked the full flavor, ginger sorbet was very pungent, and raspberry sorbet was just perfectChocolate cake - very heavy and rich, but not so sweet so could enjoy more than a bite. Coconut cake - the coconut was very subtle, without the shavings I would have missed it. All in all, the entrees and dessert were the most ""creative"", but the entrees were solid.

For $38 pp, we ordered the veal meatballs and the prosciutto for starters, however, they were out of the the prosciutto, so, we ordered the shrimp cocktail. Because they felt bad that they were out of the original order, they gave us more shrimp! We also ordered cocktails to go with our appetizers, but again, they were out of the whiskey my husband ordered, so, they gave us wine on the house and was very generous with my husband's other choice of whiskey. For the main entree, we ordered the Colorado Braised Lamb and the Creekstone Prime rib with 2 sides of creamed spinach and button mushrooms. I'm very particular about how my lamb is cooked, but Maloney did an exceptional job! The prime rib was amazing as well. Creamed spinach was good, but I would recommend the button mushrooms! For dessert, we ordered the sorbet and ice cream and the coconut cake. The sorbets were a bit too tart for our liking but the coconut cake was soft, moist and delicious!

My friend and I were enjoying dinner at the back corner of the first floor on the bar counter overlooking the kitchen. It was great seeing all the chefs prepare the food and get an idea of what to order just by watching all the food leave the kitchen. We were shocked towards the end of the meal when out of no where a large roach flew onto our table and crawled along the edge before disappearing. That has never happened to me ever so I was stunned still and when we both snapped out of it we immediately told the staff and got out of there. I do give them kudos for getting the manager quickly to take care of our check but I don't accept this reasoning ""this is NYC and it happens sometimes that's hard to avoid."" Well I understand it's a dirty city but I won't accept that of any restaurant I eat at. I did give it 1 star however because we'll it's the lowest rating allowed but even so the food was good. Although the taste is tainted by thoughts of what other critters may have been walking around in the kitchen that I shutter. But in the spirit of yelp I ordered the chicken parm and a salad that my waitress assured me was not big. Well the salad she recommended turned out to be a meal sized salad and I felt guilty not being able to finish it because I still had my chicken to eat. I did look pretty ridiculous with what was basically two dinners in front of me for myself. I think it's safe to say I probably won't be coming back.

Then back in November I ordered the lobster bisque. Apparently the new chef did not get the memo that a bisque is a cream-based soup, not stock-based. Oh well.However, on my most recent trip, May 21, 2015, I ordered the fresh lobster and green beans amandine. When it was ready the waiter brought a table over to my table on which he then cracked the lobster and pulled out the meat. He must not have been very used to doing it yet--it took him a little while and he dropped some shell on the floor, but no big deal. The lobster was delicious but the greens beans were unbearably salty.The shocker however came with the bill. When I travel on business, I have a per diem, so I am very careful. This was a two-pound lobster (no wonder I couldn't finish it) for $50! At no time did the waiter ask me what size lobster I would like or inform me that the kitchen only had two-pound lobsters or anything like that.

It's not a long list, but there were quite a few that caught my attention, particularly, their Heirloom Beet Salad.And it definitely did not disappoint. I was thrilled with my meal. The beets were roasted to perfection, and accompanied by complementary textures of crunchiness that made it really wonderful. I also ordered a side of old fashioned creamed spinach and that was phenomenal too! For a steak house, I was very impressed with how they showcased vegetables, and offered something for even the non-meat eaters.For dessert, I was absolutely spoiled and got to try the Ice Box Chocolate Cake, as well as the Wood Oven Apple Tart. A note of caution for those brave enough to order the chocolate cake - it is rich. Seriously, I think the cake alone would have been filling in it of itself, and it was absolutely delicious. The apple tart was superb as well, and the ice cream just made it perfect.

4.0,3/16/2015,"Usually I try to stay away from restaurant week because of the small portions of mediocre food... But wow! Did this place prove me wrong!I came here with my girlfriend for a surprise birthday dinner after work and this place had the perfect atmosphere for a Friday night out. The restaurant was warmly lit and filled with a good mixture of couples, coworkers and families all cheerily laughing and having a good time. The food here was surprisingly satisfying for restaurant week. They started us off with their warm straight from the oven pretzel breadsticks served with honey mustard butter. I could have had a whole meal with just that and my girlfriend would tell you that I did!My girlfriend ordered the shrimp cocktail for appetizer and those three shrimp were the largest shrimp I've ever seen!! I ordered the beef cappracio which was good but not as good as the shrimp. For the main course I had the perfectly cooked ribeye with roasted potatoes. The meat was tender and the potatoes were crunchy. It was a little on the salty side but it was delicious. My girlfriend got the lamb with a side of apple sauce. At first I thought it was a weird combination but the tender lamb which fell right off the bone along with the sweet and tangy apple sauce  were like heaven in my mouth! For desert I had to get back at my girlfriend since she's obviously ordered the better two dishes that night. I took a chance by ordering the coconut cake while she ordered the chocolate cake. That coconut cake was the perfect ending to the perfect meal! It had the perfect amount of sweetness and it really hit the spot. We finished every last drop of it! Definitely need to find the recipe!

4.0,3/9/2015,"Time to close off restaurant week with class - if you're looking for amazing steak and great service, this is where it is at.  We made a reservation for 7:30PM on a Friday and it was packed.  The bar was filled with chatty men in suits and the tables were full of couples, friends, and families.  The light was very dim and the entire place was lit by individual candles covered by a lamp-shade, I'm assuming to dim the brightness of the flame.  The décor is nice - dark wood and brass embellishments everywhere, along with statutes of animals like fish and lamb (my friend jokingly said: ""It's all the animals they serve on the plate!"").Their restaurant week menu was pretty good with a lot of variety for your seafood lovers and meat lovers.  Unfortunately, no vegetarian option but a good choice of meats.  They started us off with soft, thin breadsticks and honey mustard butter (which was amazing).  For my appetizer, I had the shrimp cocktail - three jumbo sized shrimps resting in ice with half a lemon on side and cocktail sauce, along with a spicier sauce, but too spicy for my taste.  The shrimp was so fresh and tasty!  Mostly everyone around us ordered the prime rib-eye, which was also very delicious.  It is not a huge slab of steak, but rather two medium-sized pieces that were cooked and flavored very well.  The accompanying potatoes were all the rave at my table because they were nice and toasted on the outside but soft on the inside.  And for dessert, I had to get their chocolate ice box cake.  It was a pretty good-sized dessert.  Laying in dark chocolate syrup and topped with a meringue just made this rich dessert just a great ending.  Overall, the meal was very hearty but there was very good portion size.  The presentation was certainly plain but not lacking in the flavor factor.  The service was also very good as well.  For some reason, they did accidentally charge my friend $15 for her beet salad, which was included in the menu, but made quick amends.  Also- their bathroom is strangely placed in their basement (sitting on the top floor means going down two flights), but it's clean and it has a couch for you and your food baby after!  Haha.",0,0,0,Janice F.,"Manhattan, NY",573,503,401

Anyway, as we were ordering, the waitress says ""oh the steak is actually a roast beef, is that ok?"" ... uh, no that's not ok. It's not steak! If I'd known there would be no steak, I'd have gone to a place with steak, ya know? But I digress..We ordered lamb shank and chicken under a brick, which were both very good (even though it wasn't steak). The lamb fell off the bone and the chicken was crispy on top and tender on the inside. We got sides of creamed spinach and tater tots - spinach was pretty good though a little watery and tots were too overdone in my opinion. Neither side was good enough to be worth the $11-12 it cost.Overall, pretty good food (though I can't speak to the steak), good service, nice ambiance.",0,0,0,Liz Z.,"Chicago, IL",731,87,142

I'm not quite there at that level as this was my first visit but it has potential to be on my regular list. Let's be real no one can afford a high end steakhouse in their rotation of regular restaurants, well I can't at least. So restaurant weeks is a perfect opportunity to get a taste of the other steakhouses out there without breaking the wallet (unless you are shameless dater and out to get a free meal - I'm not balling at that status yet haha) So my partner in crime was nearly 30 minutes late for our reservation, but the hostess was nice enough to seat me nevertheless and I was thankful because it was really cold out and didn't really want to stand by the door, but not sure if waiting 30 mins at a table by myself was any less embarrassing - oh wells. My guest arrives and we are served some soft pretzel sticks with this sweet mustard butter, CRAZY good! Appetizers - I got the shrimp cocktails - 3 huge shrimps and my guest got the beef carpaccio, both very good. Then came the entree, so to be fair my waiter did warn me the supposed bone rib eye steak was more of a slice of a prime rib, but why go to a steakhouse if you are not ordering steak, this was the only beef option for restaurant week.  The meat was ok but portion wise I devoured it in less than 10 mins. My friend got the brick chicken, skin was crispy and had this really nice lemon garnish.  I also ordered the scallops appetizer off the restaurant week menu - the pumpkin puree was wayyy too sweet and the scallops weren't exactly hot - so it was ok.  For dessert I got the panna cotta and my friend ordered the coconut cake, I wasn't blown away but my friend loved the panna cotta because of the almond brittle on top. I wish I would have stopped after the appetizer of shrimp cocktail, the rest of the meal was ok but nothing extraordinary. I heard that the Pork Shank is the star of the show so may need to visit outside of restaurant week to try that. But I will say all throughout the night my waiter was super cool, my water glass was filled maybe 6-7 times :) I drink ALOT of water and he filled my glass up everytime without asking. He also was very attentive and just very friendly to the surrounding tables which seemed like he had developed a base of regulars.

4.0,2/18/2015,"***ALL YOU CAN DRINK 3 Course Dinner*** $79, enough said....but I'll say a bit more anyways.Please keep in mind, my review becomes less reliable as the night goes on....you should probably disregard my desert comments as they are most likely confabulated. Maloney and Porcelli: the venue is your classic looking old school NYC steakhouse. That's the vibe. Spacious, waiters and to my surprise, waitresses, dressed in suits.  I came here with a large group from work, 11 to be exact.  I can't say Maloney's is up there with the other steakhouse great, you know the ones, but the all you can drink factor is for sure worth it if that's what ur in to.#House red, white, prosceco: which ever you want. Drinks stop at the desert course so take advantage. But stay classy, it'll be a shame if they take away this wonderful and unique deal for a few.  20% of my groups who partook in all you can drink did not make it out in great shape, shame on them. #3 course dinner:This is not a prixe fixe, even though it is.  What I mean is that you actually get to pick from their entire menu, 1 app, 1 entree, 1 desert. The only entree not included is the surf and turf (which is fair and quite reasonable), and sides no included.  But with that said, I got the lobster as an appetizer and huge bone in ribeye for entree.  Shared a giant cherry jubilee for desert. - cold lobster app: solid start, nothing special, good cocktail sauce with mild horseradish taste- bone-in rib eye: can't say enough about the CHAR. Something that I think every good steak should have. The best char I've had perhaps ever. With that said, the meat itself (cooked medium rare) was not as tender,fatty,flavorful as I'd hoped for. Still excellent, and the etoh helped.- cherry's jubilee....too enibrated to comment: i took a picture. comes in a giant glass goblet, supposedly for two.  They prepare the cherry's tableside with a portable stove, flames ablaze and all.OVERALL: I'd do it again.",0,0,0,George T.,"New York, NY",547,236,1196

4.0,1/23/2015,"Let me start by saying this place deserves 5 stars for service. The food, however, is more of a 4, so I gave it 4 stars.I came here for a work dinner and I have to say service was on point. All the waiters were super friendly and super helpful. Our water glasses were constantly filled as well as our wine glasses. Since the restaurant is known for their pork shank, but not everyone wanted to order their own pork shank, the waiter had a good idea of ordering one for the table and cutting it up.  I have to say that I didn't love the pork, but it may have been because I got quite a fatty piece and I'm not a fan of the fat. Other appetizers we ordered included the gnocchi, crab cakes and veal meatballs. All were good and after appetizers I was pretty much full.For entree I ordered the Angry Lobster. I asked the waiter if they could de-shell it for me. He said that for presentation it comes in the shell, but it's cracked and they give you a tiny fork to pull out the meat. Honestly, I still struggled with the lobster, but one waiter did show me how I was supposed to use my forks (one holds it down, the other pulls out the meat) and another offered to help me. In the end I ended up taking half of it home, partly because I just couldn't pull out the meat, partly because I was already full from the appetizers. I did ask if they could pack it up WITHOUT the shell which they kindly did. Also with dinner we ordered the creamed spinach and the tater tots. Both were good though I could only fit a few bites into my stomach.Finally for dessert (because I couldn't resist), I tried each of the ice cream flavors. The $100,000 bar was by far my favorite (don't worry, all 3 flavors of ice cream are only $10), but all 3 flavors were good. They also come served on a brownie. I apparently don't have this separate stomach everyone has for dessert, but I wish I did so I could have finished everything it was so delicious.The restaurant was a little loud so it was hard to hear any conversation that wasn't right next to you, but overall it's a nice setting and I would recommend giving it a try.",2,1,0,Siri C.,"Frisco, TX",53,225,0

The décor was nice, and we got a window seat. Our server greeted us immediately and explained the ""unlimited wine"" dinner option to us. For $80 a person, you got unlimited wine, with any appetizer, entrée (excluding the surf and turf) and dessert. How can you beat that? We started with the gnocchi and lobster bisque soup. The soup was excellent. Very creamy with a good taste. It could have used a little more meat though. The gnocchi were in a chicken stock with heirloom tomatoes and peas. They were made and cooked perfectly, but I wasn't really feeling the dish. And the fact that there were only 6 gnocchi (I counted) included I wasn't impressed. For our entrees, I had the beef wellington and my wife had the filet Oscar. Both were huge! The wellington was very well done. The pastry was light and flaky. The steak was a perfect medium rare inside. The filet Oscar was also good perfect, and had a generous amount of crab meat. For our sides, we had the tater tots and the thick cut bacon. I can honestly say it was the best bacon I have ever had. Why don't Philly steakhouses off this? The tater tots were also good, but nothing special. For dessert I have the red velvet cake and my wife had the 100k bar ice cream. The ice cream was excellent. The cake was also huge. I took most of it home and had it for breakfast. Now for the wine, I drank 6 glasses (don't judge me I was on vacation) and my wife had 4. Our total bill was $210.00. That is an amazing deal for NYC.

4.0,10/27/2014,I came here last minute after work with my boyfriend on a Friday night because he was craving steak and i had read about their $85 prix fixe wine special. It came with ANY app entree and dessert per person with 4 different wines. Once we told the waiter that's what we were going to do he poured us the prosecco before we even picked out our meals! Now that's what I'm talking about. We got refills before we even finished the appetizers. We got a white wine with our apps and then 2 different reds with our entrees. It was bottomless. Let's just say I was tipsy before the entrees even came out. All the wine was very good.. For the food we ordered :Scallop appetizer - very delicious Lobster cocktail - it was just like it sounded. A safe pick on my part but at least they didn't overcook the lobster. Sirloin and rib eye steaks - they cooked it to medium rare as requested hallelujah! It upsets me so much when I get overcooked steak. I expected to like the rib eye more but ended up liking the sirloin more. It just tasted more flavorful to me. The steaks here are great but there are better steaks in nyc. Creme Brulee - I liked that it was layered which made it more unique. The vanilla and pistachio levels were great however I found myself skipping on the chocolate level with the berry/cherry compote? Jus my personal preference though. Chocolate cake - this was my least favorite part of the whole meal. It was just super sweet and heavy but not in a decadent rich good way. We ended up taking it home..

The food included appetizers, entree and deserts. Everything was delicious. It was a slow night which probably helped us getting special attention and excellent service, the glasses were being refilled automatically. The food was coming out timed just right. We had a great time. You've got to try the cherries jubilee desert which is for two persons but actually it's more suitable for 4. It's being flambéed and prepared table side. Super delicious ice cream with cherries, whipped cream and Orion's. By the way, the crackling pork shank, rib steak and The Oscar steak turf, steak tartare were all excellent.

4.0,8/10/2014,"I came here for restaurant week and it was amazing and beyond my expectations. I do lots of research and try to make my money worth for these restaurant week deals and this place is worth every penny. To start, I got the diver sea scallops app. It was a good size, plump, and perfectly pan seared. It was served over a sweet based creamy corn chowder. I then ordered their 10oz filet mignon. And i must note most places don't offer 10oz..they offer 8oz or even smaller or they charge you a supplement fee that's half the price of your meal. It was grilled exactly how I wanted it and how steaks should be ate , at medium rare-rare. Lastly I ended it with their salted caramel icecream with coffee crumble on top. And it ended absolutely amazing. As we were dining, the table next to us ordered the bone-in crackling pork and it looked like the most juiciest and tender slab of meat as they were cutting it off the bone to serve. This was not a restaurant week item, but I'm already planning my next visit there with the pork as my victim.",5,0,0,Rebecca T.,"New York, NY",57,45,51

From the raw bar (very fresh and well presented) to the salads, to the steaks, to the sides its all delicious. The wine list is solid as well.

I should have known it was going to be a bad experience when they sat us up against the cash register so I could hear all the credit card authorizations vibrate through my head. Nice waiter but really lame food. A martini should be served in a martini glass, not a fish bowl-don't mess with a classic.

Had a large table of 10 people, all ordered from restaurant week menu except for one steak tartare and a few side dishes. Scallops app was quite good, filet mignon was a bit chewy though moist. But not even good enough to finish. Dessert was nothing to write home about - in fact I sampled all the rest. week desserts and all were disappointing. Creamed spinach side dish was very tasty, tater tots burnt, dry nearly inedible. Waiter had an attitude and yelled embarassingly & unprofessionally at the dessert chef right in front of our entire table after we made a small complaint about finding a piece of plastic in one of the desserts, making us feel horrible for complaining; we later apologized to the dessert chef. I was also eaten alive by a mosquito during the meal, making me question the cleanliness of this establishment.

2.0,7/22/2014,"My review is focused solely on the Restaurant Week menu. I had the Diver Scallops on chowder, filet mignon (medium rare), the chocolate ice box cake, and a glass of the cabernet wine. The scallops on chowder was good, nothing amazing. But I have to say I was sorely disappointed with the entree and dessert. The filet mignon did come out cooked to order, but it was very chewy, veiny, and did not have much taste to it. I have had both buttered and regular filet mignons before, but this really just did not hit the spot. I actually got tired of eating it and didn't even finish. I had hoped the dessert would make up for it, as I love chocolate cake. However, again, I was disappointed. It was rich, but it was neither fluffy or the brownie like texture. It was very odd. Again, I took a few bites, but did not feel compelled to finish eating it. Maybe others will have better luck with the restaurant week menu here, but my sister and I did not enjoy it at all. You might have better luck just ordering off the regular menu here since it seems like they did not pay much attention to the restaurant week dishes.

My. God. This stuff was like crack!  I almost picked up the dish and licked it clean!  For dessert, we had the Zoot Suit Crème Brulee and the chocolate cake.  Both were amazing, but after all the other food and countless refills of our wine, we just couldn't finish them.I would be remiss if I didn't mention the service here.  Any time we were low on water or had an empty dish on our table, there was someone there to take care of it.  Our server, Russ (?), was great.  He pointed us in the right direction on every course, and made sure we never ran out of wine.  As we were finishing up, and the restaurant was emptying, he came over and chatted with us for a bit.  The manager came by to make sure we were happy with everything, and even gave Russ permission to have a shot of Jameson with me!  The return to our hotel was celebrated by slipping into a food coma, and the hangover I had the next day, as I was being touristy and walking across the bridge, was absolutely excruciating, but it was all worth it for such a wonderful dining experience!",4,2,2,Steve T.,"Carrollton, TX",11,9,0

After reading the reviews here I decided this would have been a great place to go to have a good time, eat some good food. Sure enough we go have a good time and no one really complained about the food. I on the other hand had the crackling pork shank and it was DISGUSTING. Very fatty and oily and the skin tasted awful. I pushed through it and finished it because everyone seemed to be enjoying their food and I didn't want to make a scene. We ended up having dessert which was the best part. I would recommend  the red velvet and chocolate cakes if you had to go there. They were very good, The wine was bad and the sides were all cold when they got to our table. As bad as all of that was everyone still said they liked the place and the food was good and they enjoyed it,This is where everything gets bad though.

And you can choose from their full menu for appetizer and entrees. For appetizer, I had the colossal lump crab which was great! My friends all had different appetizers and enjoyed their dishes as well. I had their rib steak medium rare. Rib steak is basically rib eye with the bone. It wasn't the best rib eye I had. Need a bit more seasoning I felt. But it hard to go wrong with a nice cut if beef. As for the wine, you can have all four types of wine or just stick to the ones you like.

We came here for a much needed date night and both took advantage of the $79 wine dinner special. If during your visit you see that special running, trust me and go with that. It's a steal: there are absolutely no restrictions whatsoever. ANY appetizer (even raw bar!), ANY entree, ANY dessert and unlimited wine. And GOOD wine, at that!Our server, John was a delight. Very polite and knowledgeable, and funny! Once we told him we were ordering the wine dinner, he immediately filled our glasses before taking our order, saying ""I couldn't take a wine dinner order without you both having glasses of wine in front of you."" Ha! He also indulged our inebriated inquiry about why they have a steak named after the star of Perfect Strangers on their menu, although I forget his answer at the moment. Blame it on the alcohol ...Our orders included the lump crab from the raw bar, and the halibut gravlax with creme fraiche and horseradish granita to start. The angry lobster and the filet oscar, medium rare for entrees. And the apple tart, and zoot suit creme brulee to round out our meal. EVERYTHING was spectacular. My filet in particular was cooked to perfection, and easily the best steak I've ever had. I was already planning my return visit before the main courses hit the table.And when they say unlimited wine, they mean it. Every time I went to the bathroom, my wine was refilled when I returned to the table. I don't think my glass was ever empty. I'm not sure how many glasses we had, as they were constantly full. Needless to say, we were quite giggly and tipsy by the end of the meal.We did order two additional things that ironically were the only two items that we weren't floored by. The half dozen oysters were very tasty and briney, but rather small and overall unnecessary. I also ordered the gruyere souffle for the novelty of it: I'd never had a souffle before and was excited for my first experience. While it wasn't bad, I realized that I guess I don't particularly like souffles. It wasn't what I expected and I wouldn't order it again. But, that's just a matter of preference and in no way a reflection of the restaurant itself.We definitely got our money's worth and enjoyed a wonderful evening with great conversation and food in an old school atmosphere. I loved the classic uniforms, the rolling carts for food and drinks and the dark cherry wood ambiance. I noted that the restaurant listed it's dress code as business casual, and we dressed the part. I was somewhat surprised and annoyed to see stray t-shirts, tank tops and flip flops amongst other diners. Come on: you're going to eat a $65 steak in $5 sandals?! But alas, we were situated in tourist central midtown and I suppose they must be accommodating as such.

The wood oven tart was okay--I thought the apples could have been cooked a little more. That could just be a personal preference though.The one off-note of the evening? This high-end restaurant served a small mug of hot water with a Lipton tea bag when I asked for tea instead of coffee after dinner. Most places bring you a small teapot with a couple choices of, at least, a mid-priced grocery store brand to choose from. I'm sure coffee drinkers won't care, but it was just so out of sync with the restaurant's upscale image I think it's worth noting.As for service, wine glasses were refreshed before they ran low and service overall was impeccable.",1,0,0,Tracy N.,"Raleigh, NC",16,26,17

It stacks up to smith and wols, the palm, all the best places. Go, is basically the move. Make a res but go early and have a drink at the bar. Small aside, when I asked how the filet mignon was prepared the server plainly stated ""get a ribeye, that's the move"". I can't decide if it was a little too ballsy, or just enough balls.

4.0,12/26/2013,"Went here on a whim to satisfy two things we needed that night: 1.  Steak... 2.  Steak!The cut of meat was not bad, should have got the Crackling Pork Shank which 2 people at my table chose and boy was that delicious ( almost as good as the one from Sofrito).  But I was at a steak house so I had thedry aged prime sirloin bu i wish i had tried the Bronson Pinchot, not the ""Charles Bronson"" as i saw someone else on here say.  (Bronson pinchot from the old show perfect strangers) Ok back to the review.  The Dry aged prime sirloin was just ok. I start my review from looking at the char, this steak seemed overcooked already.  my first cut into it revealed the following:  a Medium to Medium Well center with barely any pink left even though I ordered it Medium Rare, I even said, ""maybe even closer to rare is fine"".  Having said that, the steak was decent but a bit chewy and i found it odd that my cut was about 30% fat.  I will say that one other person at my table ordered the same thing and it came out as medium rare and while there was fat, as there should be, it was not nearly as much.  Would i give them another shot? yes so that i could have the Crackling Pork Shank or the Bronson Pinchot.",0,0,0,Ron L.,"New City, NY",22,22,2

But that aside, the Crackling Pork Shank is all it's cracked up to be - a   most amazing dish. The combination on insanely moist braised pig and incredibly crispy flash fried skin is irresistible. Also amazing - the Bronson steak. Cause how couldn't a steak named for Charles Bronson be great.  Sort of steak dianey but less creamy, spicier and with peppers. Or maybe that's a bad description.

3.0,12/16/2013,"This was a tough review to write for a lot of reasons. We came here for an old friends 30th birthday and had trouble being seated; waited roughly 45 minutes. At the end of the meal they did comp us tons of food for this inconvenience which I really respected. The service here was amazing. The wait staff had tons of personality, really cared about what we wanted, gave great recommendations and were always around for a wine refill. The only caveat was that my glass of water was empty more than I like, but with a group of 18, that can happen. I had the crab cake appetizer which was overcooked, devoid of flavor and unimpressive. I had the steak with the weird name (richot something?) which was actually quite nice. Perfectly made, great seasoning and good portion size. Not the best steak I've had but I enjoyed it with a glass of cabernet which they kept refilling. This dinner was overall a great night with great friends and the wait staff got us a table overlooking everybody else without anybody around us to get annoyed by our boisterous antics. In that vein, I will give them a respectable 3 stars but was overall unimpressed with the meat and appetizer. The desserts were a step up with the velvet cake, apple tart and banana ice cream being very good. Not exceptional but definitely better than the appetizer and possibly rivaling the steak! The soft pretzel stick appetizers were a nice touch as well.Overall, with the plethora of steakhouse options (esp in Midtown), I would find it hard to recommend for someone to come here to spend good money on good meat. It's a safe bet but the food definitely needs to improve. Not that they will ever be short on customers with this location. Again it bears repeating, the service here was excellent from the first steps in the front door to the wait staff to the bartender while waiting to get seated.

4.0,12/14/2013,"This has always been my favorite of Alan Stillman's restaurants. I had not been for a few years so I suggested it for a reunion with colleagues from a former firm. We were promptly seated despite the 1 pm rush on a pre-Christmas Friday. Service was swift and professional from the get go. The soft pretzel sticks were delicious, even more so with the compound butter (mustard and horseradish I think). Wedge salads were crisp and generously sprinkled with blue cheese and bacon. The tomato slices were lackluster but it is December. Beet salads were attractive. The main event , a rib steak in my case did not disappoint. Well crusted it nonetheless remained juicy although it arrived medium and not medium rare. It was remarkably lean for a tender rib steak, and I did not end up with a plate of expensive fat. Kudos to the ranchers and butcher responsible. A portion of salmon filet seemed ridiculously small. As we  are all of an age where cardiac health is a concenr we steered clear of the signature pork shank. Sauteed spinch and home fries, the steakhouse standards were well prepared and nicely seasoned. A colleague enjoyed his filet with Roquefort, and a lobster salad was a great presentation -- not sure how much there was to eat though, Double espressos were disappointingly small and not up to the caliber of the food. Only one of my colleagues plumped for dessert - a handsome sundae like confection built on creme brulee. It tasted good but I would have preferred the simple elegance of a plain creme brulee.

5.0,3/19/2013,"Maloney & Porcelli is a steak house located in midtown with an elegant decor and feel to it.I went last Friday as part of Wine Week for a business lunch and I absolutely loved everything about my dining experience. This establishment deserves nothing but 5 stars all around!For starters, we enjoyed platters of cold seafood which included lobster, shrimp, crab legs, and oysters. Of course, there were also 3 sauces available for dipping. It was seafood heaven on a plate! During this time, some of my co-workers and I tried different white and red wines off of our wine list.I knew I was going to stuff myself from the appetizer alone so I decided to go light on the entree. I ordered the Peekytoe Crab Cake as an entree. It had grapefruit and avocado inside. There were 2 portions since this had been served as an entree. They were the most delectable crab cakes I have ever had. I was truly impressed, to say the least. The staff was nothing but pleasant from start to finish. They were very attentive and the service was rather quick seeing as we were a table of 12. Kudos to the wait staff for keeping our plates and cups full simultaneously. On a side note, they also indulged us in our request for their insanely large pepper grinder to be brought our for a photo op. Even more kudos to them for that!For dessert, I indulged since I had what some would call a light meal being that I was in a steak house. I ordered the red velvet cake with a scoop of ice cream. The presentation was just beautiful. The red velvet cake portion can serve 3 or 4 people and it was more than enough for me. The cream cheese frosting was to die for! It was not only beautiful, but delicious, which is what I really care about truth be told.If you take a look at the menu everything is reasonably priced, the food is great, and the service is amazing.

5.0,8/6/2012,"I had a nice friday night business dinner during restaurant week.  The dark classic older feeling restaurant that is Maloney & Porcelli can give you the impression that it is stuffy.  However, stuffy it is not.  The wait staff is accommodating and adheres to old school traditions that you will find in another steak house but sitting on the upper level and overlooking the restaurant gives you a feeling that the place is relaxed and spacious.The Summer Gazpacho w/ Cucumber Sorbet was daring and interesting.  Not daring in the jump off the roof sort of way, but daring in the hey, this is a cool cold soup sort of way.  It was tasty.The 10 oz Filet Mignon was just that, a 10 oz Filet Mignon.  No more, no less.  It was cooked to perfection and I added a side of asparagus, which had cheese on it.  Yum.The Zoot Suit Crème Brulee was by far the most interesting  Crème Brulee I have encountered.  In fact, while the other items were fine but not outstanding, this dessert was an unexpected superstar.  It had multiple layers, full of taste and colors.  There were berries on the bottom.  A mixture.  The menu did not explain what it was, and I can not do this item justice.  It was great.  Great as in, you reluctantly go on a blind date with someone's friend who they describe as ""nice"" and you actually want to see her again...this week, and not because you are hard up or desperate.  That is what happened to me, except substitute the girl for this Crème Brulee.  The Gazpacho was good.  So was the steak, but we had our moment and well, I have already moved on.But that Zoot Suit...that Zoot Suit keeps M & P in my thoughts...",6,4,4,Jamel O.,"Jackson Heights, NY",2620,919,212
4.0,8/2/2012,"I came here for Restaurant week and boy, was it the right decision! The lobster ravioli with summer corn was out of this world! The ravioli was perfect with big chunks of sweet lobster inside, and the corn was so sweet. Definitely 10/10. The hanger steak was very tender and perfectly cooked. Also, unlike other steakhouses they had the perfect charred crust. The fries that came with the steak were the best I've ever had. Super crispy but soft on the inside! Lastly, I had the creme brulee. Honestly, it was the weirdest creme brulee I've ever had, because it came like a trifle. Vanilla, Pistachio, Chocolate, and then Strawberry jam. I guess it was like neapolitan? Anyways, it was good. Not great but good. The service was the best part. I had the funniest waiter ever. He would start a conversation with us, and we would laugh for a good 15 minutes. He was warm and very attentive.

3.0,7/25/2012,"We landed up at this restaurant for dinner and were pleasantly surprised to find the restaurant week going on. They offered a steal of a deal..35 bucks for an appetizer + entree + dessert with a glass of wine for an additional 10 bucks ! While I would give them 5 stars for offering this deal, the reasons for lowering their rating outnumbered this one. The appetizer was good, the fish was average (overdone and not tasteful enough). The steak I hear was not good either...we had some wasted portions leaving our table. The desserts were a mixed bag...they had run out of creme brulee :(and their cake portion was way too big - I'd have preferred 1/4 the size with a scoop of vanilla ice-cream on the side instead). The sorbets I heard were a sad deal as well. To top it off, when I ordered my second glass the hostess tells me...I hope you know the second glass of wine will be at full rates !

2.0,7/24/2012,"I've always referred to yelp for my dining options, and have never before felt so compelled to write a review. I came here with my family for dinner over the weekend for Restaurant Week 2012. It was a good deal for a 3-course dinner for $35, and it was my first time at the restaurant. The restaurant itself was very nice, and the host and hostess at the front podium were extremely nice and polite. However, the same cannot be said about my actual server.Like Kelly D., we also experienced sub-par service, and my waiter seemed annoyed that I asked for the Restaurant Week menu, though I did order sides from the regular menu. Additionally, he did not really check up on us throughout our 2 hours at the restaurant. The busboy, who brought out the cart with the dishes, was nicer to us than the actual server. It was the busboy who stopped by our table to ask if we were okay, and if we needed anything else. When I asked for the check, the server simply placed down the check, and did not speak another word. Even after leaving a generous tip, he did not even acknowledge us as he walked by as we were getting up to leave the restaurant. I don't think he spoke more than 5 sentences to us during our entire time at the restaurant. I've worked as a hostess for an upscale midtown restaurant, and I've worked during past Restaurant Weeks. Yes, the meal is cheap, but many people try out expensive restaurants during this week. Some patrons even become return customers from sampling the menu during this week. I think its a terrible idea to ignore customers who come for Restaurant Week, as you never know who will become the next regulars at your restaurant.In any case, the actual food was decent, though I've definitely had better. We ordered the 10 oz filet mignon, which was decent. A bit on the dry side, but the texture was ""like butter"", to quote my brother. We also had the soft-shelled crab with summer greens, which was cooked just right, though a bit carby/salty because of all the breading used on the crab. The chocolate cake was a bit too chocolately for my own taste, though I'm sure chocolate enthusiasts will love it.We came here for a nice quiet family dinner, and quiet it was, as our server didn't speak to us. If you come here and order from the regular menu, I'm sure you will be acknowledged by the waitstaff. However, I would urge you not to come for Restaurant Week, as the service is terrible. I'm pretty sure I'll never come back, because the food was mediocre, and the service was possibly the worst I've had.",2,0,0,Nini M.,"Manhattan, NY",0,2,0

Ok so I booked it. I really liked the layout and openness of the place, so points there right away. The bar was also a nice place to hang out. We were seated as soon as we were ready so no issues there. We had a really nice waitress who was most helpful and the guy who took our order was very sharp, like a stage actor almost, but issues, it's just another way of doing things. I really liked the wine list, it was approachable and had enough that I like. Since we were there for the ribeye we all ordered it, cooked in different styles. My first reaction was, oh, tastes like Del Friscos (you know me!). As I went further in I thought it was a bit less cooked than how I wanted, but good anyhow. If you're wondering, is it a life altering experience, I would say no. Is it good steak, yes for sure. The sides were good too. Oh btw, for those who are steak snobs this is grain fed and dry aged. I recently had a ribeye that was grass fed and also dry aged, which was probably the best tasting ribeye I have ever had short of Wagyu.So here it is...The Good- Food- Service- DecorThe Bad- Nothing reallyThe Ugly-Too many guys in suits!Note: Go and check it out",0,0,0,Sabin C.,"Scarsdale, NY",93,326,547

And, I won't forget how after a couple of months, one of my friends just couldn't take hearing the vegetarian anthem anymore and took me out for a steak; that feeling of satiety seems to still hit me every time now. And since I am older, my diet doesn't include a lot of red meat but when I hunger for it, I got to have it. So, obviously we enjoyed the food, had a great wine and the service from start to finish was excellent. Definitely another place that I would recommend to friends.

I've really had a great dining experiences with each visit. The venue lends itself to the suited up after work businessmen in midtown, but the aura doesn't feel pretentious, just classy. The food is flavorful and abundant, and the service has been accommodating and patient. While the price tag may feel steep, the environment and cuisine should validate the bill.Even though there was only two of us sharing the booth, we more than filled up the real estate on the table for four. We ordered the Tuna & Avocado Tartare, Shrimp Cocktail and Carmelized Sea Scallops for starters. Then moved to the main course where I ordered (for a second time) the Cajun Filet Mignon cooked medium rare, and as tender as it comes. While the Cajun Filet was delicious, I still envied the Bone-In Rib-Eye my friend had ordered. We complimented the red meat with Roast Asparagus, Whipped Potatoes and Old School Mushrooms to share. The meal did feel heavy, but at the end of the day, that is to be expected. That's usually enough food to require a nap halfway through.We even tried to save a little room for desert as we polished off some ice cream atop a warm brownie, but there were more decadent sweets on the dessert menu for your personal fancy.

1.0,1/3/2012,"I'm vegan and gluten-free so keep that in mind when you see my rating. I went with a large group for dinner and called ahead of time to warn them about my dietary needs. On the phone they assured me they would be able to accommodate me (in hindsight, I suspect they didn't want to lose a table of 20 on a holiday). I'm sure the waiter understood my requirements because he made sure to warn me about options that had dairy, egg, meat, or gluten during service. I was still served something with dairy in it which was very unpleasant for myself and my friends later in the evening. The restaurant didn't have any options dedicated to persons with special dietary requirements and literally served me ramekins filled with every side dish on the menu. Each one was tasty, cooked appropriately, and non-offensive to my Celiac's disease; 2 kinds of mashed potatoes, creamed spinach (probably the offending dish with respect to my lactose intolerance), asparagus, mushrooms, and mixed beets. I started with a salad of fresh greens which was tasty but boring. My meal ended with a bowl of mixed berries which were appropriately ripe and fresh but still, boring. I would give that part a 2. In terms of quality of ingredients and preparation. For what I paid I would at least hope for some creativity and excitement.The rating I give comes from their apparent lack of effort and attention to detail. I could have baked a lovely shepherd's pie with the ingredients as presented or a hearty potato spinach lasagna with the whole ingredients. Instead I got 6 bowls of almost safe food.

5.0,7/21/2011,"I'm really surprised to see the meh stars for Maloney and Porcelli! I came here last night to try the restaurant week menu and thought it was thumbs up.I'll start with the first pleasant surprise: IT WAS NOT HARD TO GET A RESERVATION FOR RESTAURANT WEEK. With other places but you need to seriously book places 2 weeks in advance sometimes! Here, my bf reserved a spot for 2 a few days in advance, for prime time, 8pm on a Wednesday and had no problems. Originally, we had Thurs for 8 with no problems, and then switched it to Wed. Check!When we arrived, the house was pretty full though. Note this is your business dinner place, not a date place. I mean, yeah I knew that I still got some raised eyebrows from the outfit I was wearing from the 60+ crowd. Not that I was wearing anything inapprops, just a peach sundress! Anyway, the decor is somewhere between a steakhouse and old American diner. Nothing to rave home about, but the booth we got was spacious and the bathrooms nice and clean. The bread at the table was a sliced, warm loaf of pretzel bread (it wasn't pretzel, but tasted eggy and soft, similar to pretzels), and these big, house made tortilla chips.. or more like just fried tortillas. The butter mixture had mustard in it- so for that, I wasn't a fan (hate mustard). But, I guess that furthers my pretzel bread thesis. We ordered from the restaurant week menu. Our waiter told us it was $24 originally, which we knew was wrong (it's $35 for the dinner 3 course) but he came by around minutes later to correct us. I would come back to try the regular menu as I'm told the pork chop is their known staple. I had: 1. Corn Bisque with Lobster Fritters 2. Halibut with Summer Risotto 3. Sour Cherry CrispThe corn bisque must have had strained corn juice because there no pieces of corn but it was really good. Not very creamy like most bisques. Still very flavorful though. They'll put fresh pepper in it which was nice. The lobster fritters were yummy- packed with lobster and corn. It was indeed fried (like a hush puppy) but didn't taste overly greasy. The halibut was the best part of my meal. I'm surprised at a steakhouse doing a delicate fish so well. The halibut was flaky but not overdone so had a good texture to it, still. It was simple and not seasoned much but had great natural flavor (just a bit pan roasted), and atop a DELICIOUS creamy risotto. Risotto was buttery, with nice veggies, and corn pieces. The sour cherry crisp had merit, but it was on the crumbly side- meaning it was a bit drier than I was expecting. But, that doesn't mean it was bad. I was expecting more goo. There was a lot of fun stuff in it- crumble, REAL (not canned) sour cherries, chocolate pieces, and nuts. A must-try. Coincidentally, I saw a gf dining here at the same time (shout out to Buo Z) and she said the coconut cake was really good. She also said she had the surf and turf and the lobster tail was dry... ok enough reviewing for other people lol. My bf had: 1. The house green salad2. The filet mignon (10 oz I think), medium rare3. The trio of sorbetsThe house green salad was a bed of fresh, nutty, mesculin greens. The dressing a light, sweet balsamic. It was simple and plain- definitely a DIY salad but my bf's on a diet. It came with one slice of a beefsteak tomato.... juicy. The steak I didn't try- yes, I always take heat at steakhouses because I don't eat steak. My bf said it was good though- not the best he's ever had but not bad. He's a ""ribeye guy"", quote. He was a fan of the steak sauce though which was smoky and sweet. I did try this a bit.The sorbets were good, palette cleansers- again with the diet theme. There was coconut, peach and blueberry. All good representations of the flavors. Service was fast (I mean, FAST!). I mean it's RW so they have everything ready to go but I think our whole meal took like an hour and 15! Our waiter was really charismatic and nice- and he didn't look down upon us when we didn't order wine.Interesting part: My bf didn't order any sides for his steak, because of the diet theme. A waiter (not our waiter, who is a nice Australian guy) came by to give us two sides- the creamed spinach and mashed potatoes. He said, ""Aw, your steak looks so lonely."" We were weirded out for a moment because really, it wasn't a money thing, we just didn't want any sides (well my bf didn't, I'm pretty down with creamed spinach and mashed p's). But we took them anyway. And they were good! The creamed spinach, especially, which was buttery, and creamy, and had finely chopped spinach and broccoli (!). The mashed potatoes were great too- with chopped chives, and black pepper. They were the creamy kind, not the chunky kind. When the bill came, we figured the sides would not be on there, but it was. Awkward! We told our waiter and he apologized and correct it. They weren't cheap- $11 each. My gf told me they gave her free sides too, so I guess it's all in good spirit.He got a nice tip.",4,4,2,Stephanie Y.,"New York, NY",878,1242,25

The couple hooked an iPod up to the speaker system, which made things much more personalized and probably more enjoyable than the stock playlist. The party was more of a bar and h'ordeuvres affair, but I can say that the food they brought around was AMAZING. My favorite item was a goat cheese and spinach pie, but also notable were a tuna tartare and a beef kebab (I only ate the veggies off of it, but it was amazing).

4.0,7/21/2010,"3.5 stars...I went to Maloney & Porcelli for lunch the other day for their restaurant week special. I really enjoyed my experience there and I found the portion sizes to be more generous than any of the other upscale restaurants I've been to. They were also the only restaurant week participant I had visited to offer a selection of discounted wines (they had 3 to choose from) as part of the menu (they rounded up from $24.07 to $30 with the wine). They also participate in the restaurant week dinner but the menu is practically the same so for $11 less the lunch is a much better value if you can fit it in.The decor here is very traditional and classic (I think it would really fit in with diners in the 40+ crowd). They had all the things you'd expect from a nice restaurant but the one thing that I thought was out of character was that the menu, wine list, and bill were all presented in a cardboard type of folder. Usually restaurants of this caliber have these things either bare or within a leather folder of sorts. I was going here by myself for lunch and had made a reservation (for 1) but the place was pretty empty so I realized it wasn't necessary. When I arrived the hostess got my name, saw my reservation, then asked if I wanted to wait at the bar for the rest of my party to which I had to remind her that I was the whole party. It felt like the scene from Forgetting Sarah Marshall (kind of sad, kind of funny). For all the tables they had available in the restaurant they sat me next to the cupboards that held things that the waiters kept going behind me for. They didn't need me to move or anything but it was mildly annoying and I'm surprised that's where they put me.In terms of the food they started me off with a bread basket that included a whole loaf of dense homemade bread and thin wafer like crackers (just like the Indian pappadom but without the spice) with a honey mustard butter. I would have much rathered regular butter as I hate mustard but it was an interesting twist none the less. I started with a corn bisque with corn and lobster fritters. The 3 tiny bite sized fritters were served on the side and though they were very good and the fresh taste of lobster was there I was hard pressed to see much meat at all (perhaps because they were too small to physically fit much of anything in there). The corn bisque was absolutely amazing though, especially with the bread. For an entre I got the halibut with the corn risotto. The portion of fish was pretty large and was well seasoned though I think it was a tad overcooked. The risotto was amazing and complemented the fish perfectly. For dessert I got the chocolate layer cake that was served with a small scoop of toasted banana ice cream. The cake was incredibly dense and the portion was giant (about the size of a piece of Juniors cheesecake but ever more dense and filling). The dessert really put me over the edge and I wished I had showed up more hungry than I did (I thought I learned not to show up starving to an upscale restaurant when I went to Aureole and even Delmonico's).Yes Maloney and Porcelli isn't perfect but overall my food was very good, portions were good, and it was probably the best restaurant week deal I had found yet. They might be a tad too expensive for me to come any other day but I'll definitely keep them in mind for the future (especially future restaurant weeks).UPDATE: This was my third time going to Maloney and Porcelli for restaurant week, this time was a little different from previous experiences. The service was among the worst I've ever had, considering the restaurant was near empty I have no idea why the service was so inexcusably bad. Also because of construction on the subway below the restaurant there was banging going on the whole time, very annoying. In terms of food I ordered the same thing as I've had in the past but the soup wasn't that hot, the lobster fritters were a little greasy and had no visible lobster in it whatsoever, and the ice cream that accompanied the chocolate cake was one of the worst ice creams I've ever had. The main course (halibut with corn risotto) was still quite good, but they really dropped the ball this time.",1,0,1,Matt E.,"Brooklyn, NY",785,2205,1856

Honestly I don't have much of a sweet tooth but these were so intense. The coconut cake could only be inhaled if accompanied by some coffee drink.

1.0,7/16/2010,"Never again.  Not with my money, or anyone else's.In a nutshell, the affable and sincere service and comfy seating could not save us from the horror of microscopic appetizers, a flavorless steak and dry pork ""signature"" pork shank.First the good:  You'll never wait long inbetween courses.  The staff are right on top of clearing off your table and  seeing to it that whatever you ask for, you are given.  However, this place should be about food and that area is, unfortunately, an epic fail!  When you arrive at your table you are given a larve 16"" x 20"" menu of wines, a smaller foldout menu of mixed drinks and, after you ask, a much smaller menu of actual food.  The message is clear:  WE WANT YOU TO ORDER WINE!  I didn't.  I had to drive that evening.The two quarter-sized carmelized scallops we were served ($16 ) were bland, arrived on our table luke warm and were waaay too small, even for an appetizer portion.  The wild mushroom cavatelli ($15) with chirozo, although savory and rich, was also about 50% smaller than it should have been.For the main course, my dining partner ordered the crackling pork shank which was properly huge but was served fairly dried out.  If you're on a lean-meat/no fat diet, order this pork shank because it definitely is LEAN!  I ordered the large rib steak and although it was cooked medium rare, as I had asked, the steak managed to have absolutely no juice, fat or any other type of moisture that one would expect from a rib steak.  Very depressing.  The sides were a surprise hit, however.  The creamed spinach was creamy, nicely seasoned and not-too salty.  The M&P signature balls were also great but needed another portion of dipping sauce.   For dessert, I had the cherry crisp and my dining partner had the carrot cake sundae.  Both were good and nearly worth the $10 price.Another oddity, we ordered several bottles of Pelligrino and not once did I ever see a bottle opened on front of me.  The bottle was brought to the table already opened AND with the label removed from the bottle.   Hmmm strange.  Especially since each bottle as $8.75!!!In short this joint's management needs to up their game.  In our current economy, it's no time to be serving dry meats, small portions and questionable water.  NOT at the price they're charging either.  We had NO alcohol and our check was $190 (before tip).",3,0,0,Bobby M.,"New York, NY",0,16,0

Maloney & Porcelli really embraced the restaurant week spirit.  Good job team! Huge regular sized portions...specially priced (in a good way) wine offerings and delicious dessert.  You got the real deal experience without shelling out the real deal bucks.  As many people have mentioned the squash ravioloi was AMAZZZINGGG (tks for the tip folks!), the steak was delicious and the salmon hard to be outdone.  Coconut cake was sooo good and I would have inhaled the whole thing if I weren't already filled to the brim from my appetizer and entree.The only reason Maloney & Porcelli doesn't get 5 stars is b/c without restaurant week all this would have cost a pretty penny...... launching it into a whole new echelon of restaurants where I factor decor and ""cool factor"" into if I'm dropping that much coin.  In that case, it would still be in the running but not my definitive pick.",1,0,0,Jennifer Y.,"New York, NY",182,619,2

Usually when we go to nice places, the food tastes really good but the servings are tiny (especially the dessert!)  Not here!We started off with a basket of pretzel bread, which came warm and soft (it passed our squish test) It came with a wasabi/horse radish spread that I really liked!I ordered the caramelized sea scallops and the 10 oz filet mignon, while my girlfriend got the kabocha squash ravioli w/ apple & chorizo and the atlantic wild salmon. The ravioli was my favorite, but the scallops were just as delicious! I wished I had gotten the braised short ribs instead of the steak though; it was very plain, and the portion for the steak wasn't as big as the other entrees. The salmon came in 3 pcs and tasted amazing! For dessert, I got the coconut cake, and my gf got the pear and fig crisp. For some unknown reason they also gave us a complimentary 3rd dessert, their chocolate layer cake, so we definitely had our fill of sweets for the night! The coconut cake was fluffy and sooo GOOD, and the pear and fig crisp was warm and gooey, just how I like them. The chocolate layer cake came with a scoop of banana ice cream, which was a great combination. I wish I could say we finished it all, but I gave up on the chocolate cake.

The ravioli was probably a little more unique but they were both delicious. My entree was the braised short ribs, which came with a quinoa type side and a tomato sauce. They were tender and flavorful but just a tad salty. For dessert I got the coconut cake which was soooo gooodd. Not only did it taste delicious but they give you a huge slice!

To me, it was disgusting.  The pork was dry and flavorless, the skin was so gross and I could barely even stomach the apple sauce that was included on the side. ick!On the other hand, I am rounding up one star because my friend J.'s dish was excellent.  He ordered the lamb shank and it was savory and juicy.  Additionally, our dessert of molten chocolate cake was divine. Service was decent, but the noise level was almost deafening as the bar scene downstairs seemed like the ""it"" spot for every superficial banker in midtown...Ok, maybe I could round up to three stars because it seemed like my food was just a fluke and it's not the restaurant's fault that it's a popular spot to see and be seen, but it seriously put a damper on my experience with a restaurant (and dish) that I was really looking forward to trying.  Thus, I'm sticking to two.

4.0,1/31/2009,"Double disclaimer: I came here for Restaurant Week, so my review lacks the expensive punch of the regular prices. And I don't eat steak.That being said, I also expected to not really like Maloney & Porcelli. My friend told me to choose a place, and I decided on M&P solely for the horseradish whipped potatoes. Meanwhile, I was expecting a stuffy crowd of suits swilling back Johnnie Walker Blue Label and bragging about the latest merger deal they brokered. Most of the clientele was indeed of such a variety, and the jockey statues, wood finishing, and beautiful porcelain plates and gleaming silverware definitely gave the place an old boys' club feel.However, it wasn't as tight-laced as I expected; my guess is that the combination of Restaurant Weekers and the awesome staff kept the place from being overbearingly highbrow. Even though my friend and I arrived 10 minutes early, our hostess apologized profusely for not having a table ready; the upstairs host joked with me about my name; our waiter kept complimenting us; and our waitress apologized for an extremely drunk patron who had stumbled into pretty much every table on his way to the bathroom. It was a really nice surprise to have such great staff at M&P.And now, the food. For an appetizer, I had caramelized scallops, which were incredible; the garnish, which had tomatoes, pineapples, onions, and pine nuts, complemented the fresh scallops perfectly. My friend loved her ravioli. As an entree, we both had the salmon with horseradish whipped potatoes; it was INCREDIBLE. I cannot overstate how good this dish was. The salmon was fresh and flavorful, which is so difficult to find, and the whipped potatoes were a delicious treat below the salmon. For dessert, I had the chocolate cake, which was standard, but my friend had the fig and pear crisp, served warm and delicious.The only thing that bothered me was that it was really loud inside, and the upstairs portion is very warm. No wonder that one guy got so drunk.Bathroom Grade: 7/10. A nice bathroom, with a chaise to lounge on and cloth napkins to wipe your hands with, but the stalls are entirely too tiny.

It had the typical ""upscale"" steakhouse look to it, and the expected clientele to match. If you want to perfect your fake business laugh, this would be a good place for it :)The service was great, the cold seafood .. lump crab, crab claws, and lobster were all fantastic. I was super surprised and impressed with that. Even the bread basket goodies were tasty. The cocktails were strong, shaken & poured tableside, which I like. So the steak must have been great, right? Wrong and yuck! I ordered a very rare 10oz filet, and get a very rare 10oz filet.. yay :) Until, I actually tried it. There was nothing cool about the center, the entire piece of meat was just ""blah"" warm.. like the temp leftovers would be by the time I tossed them to my pups. It had a really odd metallic, raw meat/blood kind of taste to it. I know very rare, pretty much means raw, but I've never had it taste like it was going bad, which is how this seemed. Like when you smell meat to see if it's fresh and it just doesn't seem right. I ate maybe two bites of it and just let it sit there, the waitress didn't ask if it sucked and I didn't complain, just declined to have it wrapped.  My daughter however did enjoy her medium rare filet and I think she pretty much finished it all. So maybe I just got a random bad piece of steak, who knows. Oh and the sides, lol. The mashed potatoes came floating in some sort of green liquid. It wasn't described as such on the menu and the waitress didn't tell us what it was when she put it on the table. One of us tried a tiny bit and it was agreed we would be better off just letting those sit there too.

Of course, I was completely, head-over-heels enamored with the city, so in my mind this restaurant could do no wrong.I've been back a few times since then, though, and it's always lived up to the insane pedestal I placed it on back then. I didn't realize until recently that it was owned by Smith & Wollensky... I'm trying not to let that bother me, haha. So anyway, the things that most deserve mentioning about M&P:1) Whipped potatoes. Taste like heaven. Best things ever, on any menu, anywhere.2) WINE DINNER! Yes. Do it. It's worth it. They actually bring you a little too much wine. My mom had to help me finish all my ""tastings.""3) I miss the dessert that involved donuts in a paper bag.

On a recent visit, I had an absolutely massive rib eye; it was so substantial that in spite of dining at noon, I was gut bustingly full as I sat down to Valentine's dinner at 10:30 that same evening. I say this without a pinch of sarcasm. The meat was perfectly charred on the outside, but juices poured forth from the inside, which was a lovely, warm, red medium-rare - perfectly done.

We were escorted to the beautiful room upstairs with a big skylight and a long bar on one side.  I ordered a well-made Chopin dirty martini, and my boyfriend's Johnny Walker Blue Label on the rocks was filled to the top. Oh, did I mention this was an open bar? Indeed. The passed h'ors deurves were decadent.  The miniature crab cakes were all crab and no filler, and the peking duck wrap cone was sweet and crisp.  Tuna tartar was outstanding, as were the mini lobster rolls.  We were especially fond of the sushi cart that a nice gentlemen wheeled over to us with different types of sushi which used buckwheet noodles in the place of sticky rice.  Wow, it was a surprisingly great touch. The tables were handsomely appointed with champagne and wine.  We were offered a choice between salmon, rack of lamb, or filet mignon.  As a poor entry level, I had to chose the steak and red wine to match.  We were served an appetizer of shrimp cocktail with four absolutely gigantic prawns.  Next, a plate of romaine lettuce covered in a lemony cesar dressing and parmesan flakes.  Finally, the steak arrived, and what a steak it was.  I thought that my shrimp had been large, but I was blown away by this filet--  It was like the size of a small child. And guess what? It was fabulous. Perfectly medium rare, oozing with juice, and steaming hot which is impressive for large, private party.  I looked at my boyfriend, and we both grinned maniacally while we ate up our steaks.  I knew it had to be a $40 steak, and when I checked the menu this morning I was right.  And it was worth every (free) penny.  The steak was served with family style portions of fantastic creamy whipped mashed potatoes and creamed spinach, which was nice but maybe a little too mushy paired with the potatoes. Dessert was a warm individual chocolate cake that when cut into oozed out hot chocolate ganache served over vanilla ice cream.  I was stuffed by then, but made a pathetic effort to keep eating. The service was friendly, quick, and very attentive.  My boyfriend and I couldn't believe how wonderful the party was, and he had to hold my hand when he walked me out because I was floating on cloud nine.  If I could afford Maloney & Porcelli (if only I could afford Maloney & Porcelli!), I would go back for any special occasion I could think of to sample more of that decadent filet mignon.",4,4,4,Lindsay K.,"New York, NY",457,567,7
