4.0,3/15/2019,"This restaurant has solid choices and is a place where I'll take picky eaters or a group of people (4 or more). The dining area is wide and spacious, so you never feel you're sitting on top of other groups (a hard find in Midtown). Sure, it's further away from the Koreatown locations, but is sorely needed in Hell's Kitchen. Some standouts on the menu include the dukbokki (spicy, chewy rice cakes), the pajeon (savory pancakes), and the japchae (grilled noodles with veggies). I am a fan of the bossam and the bibimbap (regular or hot stone). I love ordering the bibimbap because it's huge portions but since all the ingredients are fresh and healthy, I never feel like I'm overdoing it or picking something boring like a salad. This place is a trusted favorite in the neighborhood - I'd be truly sad if they ever closed because then I'd struggle to find a place that could sit large groups easily.",0,0,0,JoAnn A.,"Manhattan, NY",1,32,0
4.0,3/11/2019,"We loved this place. Right in heart of theater district. Really good food, not overpriced, and excellent service. Happy hour daily from 5-9 a huge bonus! The only negative I can say is that you have to cook your own food and the sides were quite small. For a group of just two it's ok, but anything larger would be distracting and a hassle. But reasonably priced, great drinks and food. We would go back",0,0,0,April B.,"Staten Island, NY",7,96,0
5.0,3/8/2019,"Wow ! I literally have no words for what I just experienced . It was beyond my expectations. The decor is standard , it's a good size restaurant. This was my first time at Bann and I would gladly return again . Half of my husbands family used to/currently work at Bann and recommend to go eat . I was a little skeptical at first since I can't eat seafood nor like too much spice. Either way , I went , and I don't regret at all ; the Lychee Martini is so good . The BBQ ribs are bomb . We got the medium BBQ which is family style . Awesome experience cooking you're own meat . You're meat comes marinated ready for you to just cook it . The best and best was the desserts . I got the hot chocolate cake and it was bomb . My husband got the trio which is good too , my sister got the ice cream and my brother in law got something called dragon and it was good as well . In other words , this place is good . I highly recommend it!",0,0,0,Jenny H.,"Flushing, NY",23,45,173

2.0,2/3/2019,"Terrible service!For starters we were seated 30 minutes after our reservation time. We ordered fairly quickly, received our appetizers after about 20 minutes and then waiting another HOUR to receive one of our two main courses. It took one hour to receive the raw meat we ordered to cook at the table! They didn't even need to cook anything on the kitchen!

I haven't really ventured beyond their bi bim bap as it's so good. The Dol Sot is the best.  The only knock is the prices. You can get equally good Korean food for cheaper in K-Town, but if that doesn't deter you, then Bann is definitely worth a visit.",1,0,0,Randy H.,"Brooklyn, NY",20,214,51
4.0,12/28/2018,We have been here several times and it is always good. The atmosphere is nice. We opt to order off the menu rather than doing the barbecue at the table option. The Bann Tofu is delicious-lots is veggies in a fantastic soy-ginger sauce. The side salad they serve you has a great dressing-sort is sweet and spicy. Don't miss their bao buns-to die for! The Korean ribs are also delish. We found the sushi to be okay-sauce was lacking and fish to rice ratio was off. We were also very disappointed with the shrimp dumplings-the filling was tasteless and spongy and the sauce was lackluster. We also ordered the crepe brûlée trio for a refreshing dessert. I like that portions are generous but not overwhelming.,0,0,0,Susan A.,"Easton, PA",5,240,35

3.0,11/18/2018,"Bann is a nice korean restaurant in midtown. It is a bit more geared towards non-korean and as such, while they have authentic menu and the setup is a bit more americanized than your traditional korean restaurant in ktown, it feels a bit healthier but doesn't taste as good.

Four of us went and three of us got the bento box option, tho with different choices in each. We all devoured our meat items --- tender, flavorful, and juicy are the words. I got the Bul Go Gi -- sliced beef rib eye with korean bbq, which was way beyond my expectation. The food portion sizes here are generally big. We all felt like we could not eat any dinner that night.The little complimentary appetizers provided were not the best in my opinion -- they only offered three very tiny dishes, but it might be sufficient for someone else.Another plus is how classy this place looks.

1.0,10/22/2018,"There's a reason why this restaurant exists on the outskirts of K-Town. It sucks.I went in thinking the food may be fusiony but more so in the traditional and modern sense. Instead, the food was completely inauthentic and, well, abominable. Luckily, my friend and I (both Korean, btw) skipped out on the barbecue because the apps we ordered were inedible. If you can't even do kimbap or seafood pa jun right, I doubt you'll do K-bbq any justice.Kimbap:1) The sushi rice was too wet, thus making the seaweed wrap soggy.2) The sea bass tempura roll was tasteless and just awful. Eating it felt like eating just some moist, wrapped rice.3) The bulgogi itself had flavor but this is not enough for me to say it was great. I've had amazing kimbap before but this wasn't it.4) Came with a wasabi/maybe hoisin sauce, which was disgusting. One does not need sauce for kimbap, let alone this one.Seafood pa jun:Barely had any seafood in it. Also flavorless. Tasted just like bland, fried, thick dough with scallions. Wings:Edible but nothing about which to write home. Came with a weird blue cheese sauce. What is this? Buffalo Wild Wings?The best part of this meal was the $5 bottle of Kloud for HH. Sad but true.Long story short, go to K-Town for Korean food.",2,0,0,K P.,"Norwood, NJ",0,46,6

Friendly service, the BBQ smell not as strong compared to most of the restaurants in K-town. That's one of the main reasons I love this restaurant plus the food is good and reasonably priced.We usually order spicy honey chill glazed crispy chicken wings for an appetizer which is the bomb but wanted to try something new this time. We ordered a soft shell kimbap which was a disappointment. I barely tasted the soft shell crab only the skinny fried crab legs were wrapped inside.We also ordered pork belly and miso hot stew for soup.  I could taste the freshness of pork belly after cooking and dipped with oil and salt then wrap with lettuce, kimchi, and radish. It was to die for... The miso soup stew just the right saltiness which hit the spot with soft tofu, pork, zucchini, mushrooms, onion and grill chili in it.

We were invited by a relative who works in Manhattan. The place is clean and spacious. There weren't many customers. The meat cuts were the same as many Japanese BBQ places therefore much higher quality than other Korean BBQ restaurants I have been to. The other common Korean dishes we ordered were all of high quality. In the end, kids ordered three deserts. At first we didn't expect much from a Korean restaurant.

2.0,8/18/2018,"I came here for Restaurant Week yesterday. The menu online looked good but that's where it stops. This restaurant is not authentic Korean BBQ. First, not one employee there is Korean. The host looked like he was the chef or someone who worked in the kitchen because he was wearing a chef coat. There only 3 side dishes that accompanied my BBQ bulgogi. Usually I get several small dishes, not 3. And for sure, one of them isn't supposed to be broccoli. At every BBQ restaurant that I have been to, the waiter cooks the meat for me. Not here... I had to do it myself. Thankfully, I've been to Korean BBQ restaurants in the past,so I had an idea of what I was supposed to do. And since the flames were coming from the ends of the grill, my meat burned at the end and was raw in the middle. If someone didn't know any better, they would be fine here. But from someone who has been to K-Town, this is not Korean BBQ. For $42 per person, it was not worth it and I could've purchased a la carte for a lot cheaper bill.

5.0,8/14/2018,"Holy shit my dudes, it boggles my mind that this place has fewer than 5 stars.This is BY FAR the best Korean restaurant I've been to in the States, and the second-best overall (the first being in Seoul). Came with a (picky) relative visiting from Korea, and he agreed that it was some damn amazing Korean food -- not just ""good Korean for America,"" but ""good Korean,"" period. Ordered the kimchi jjigae, dolsot bibimbap, + yukge jang -- all authentically flavorful without being oversalted. Highly, highly recommend the kimchi jjigae if you're craving something spicy. Really liked the chicken option for the bibimbap as well, as I rarely find good bibimbap with non-beef protein options. Sauvignon blanc was also good and crisp. Interior was spacious, beautiful, spacious, ornate, and did I mention spacious? The one NYC restaurant where you won't be knocking over other people's drinks with your ass when you stand up to go to the bathroom. Service was smiling, efficient, and helpful.

4.0,7/29/2018,"So it's NYC Restaurant Week and perfect timing for our quarterly meetup to try new cuisine. We decided to try Korean cuisine for lunch. From the Asian archway to the artwork, including large sculptures, the restaurant was gorgeous. As you enter through the lounge and bar, you immediately notice the large capacity of this mid-Manhattan eatery.I loved my appetizer, which was the Dak Nal Ke (spicy honey chili glazed crispy chicken wings with pickled daikon cubes). Beautiful presentation and bold flavors. My entree was when things got really interesting. I noticed a metal enclosure in the middle of every table, but did not put two and two together until much later. I was puzzled as the server brought a tray full of ingredients (including vegetables, white rice, and our pre-seasoned raw fish and poultry) in small plates and placed them on our table.Since we ordered the Korean barbecue (salmon and chicken), we had to cook it ourselves. LOL! When it comes to cooking, I am still at the beginner level. Thankfully, with the coaching of my friend, all went well. Delicious! We thoroughly enjoyed every bite. It was such an unexpected, but pleasant surprise. It was like a hibachi, but I was my own chef without the training or techniques. What a great experience! Psst...it's definitely a great place for a date. Our prix fixe 2-course lunch was just $26, but then we decided to splurge and order the dessert course for an additional $3 based on the recommendation of our server. Such a worthwhile decision! We preferred the omija dragon (puff pastry with omija berry mousse, fresh strawberries and vanilla ice cream) over the banana sabayon (silky banana infused whipped custard with berries and sesame cookies). The omija dragon was refreshing and cool, especially after a spicy appetizer on a hot summer day. The banana sabayon reminded me of yogurt. FYI, the prix fixe 3-course dinner is $42.Hands-down, this was a memorable experience that I will definitely rave about beyond Yelp. I would have given a perfect score, but our server briefly forgot about our drinks. You can definitely tell that this place has loyal customers, because  there are chopsticks in boxes with customer names hung on the wall near the kitchen. Wow!

This place was so tastless, for lack of a better word that I was dumbfounded to know that the owner is Korean.  Not only do they not serve the variety of banchan, (just stale cubed radish & kimchi) but they don't even have naengmyeon, which is a staple at any Korean Bbq spot!! The only thing that was heavily marinated were their eel buns & even that wasn't any good. The kicker is the waiter gave each of us tongs....yeah, self serve!!!!!!

All-in-all, we were happy with the food.For drinks, I had their saketini, which was wonderful.  I loved eating the cucumber slices after finishing the drink and ordered a second one.  My friends enjoyed their cocktails, which like the food sold for $6 each.Service was a bit slow, but not too bad.  We sat in the bar area, and there was only one bartender.  He was friendly, and he never messed up an order, and our bills were divided correctly.  He also had the patience of a saint as we debated what we wanted.The décor was very nice.  They played background music that was loud enough to enjoy, but not too loud, so we didn't have to shout to each other.If you want to meet some friends and have a great time, the bar here is a wonderful place.",2,1,1,Joe L.,"Astoria, Queens, NY",152,368,1027

3.0,2/11/2018,"Came here for a friend's birthday! Stylish atmosphere, and we were seated relatively quickly.  I LOVE Korean food; Korean BBQ is always an exiting experience. However, I felt that everything was overpriced and mediocre. A good area, but don't understand why the food those prices for subpar food. I got kimchi Chige, and my partner got shrimp bibimbop. We shared dok bok ki. It was good, but that's a pretty hard dish to mess up. The kimchi chige was decent, but I was upset I didn't get my own rice. My partner's bibimbop was essentially fried rice. I was very upset by it.  Where was the stone bowl? The egg that would cook in it???  It tasted good, but so does Trader Joe's fried rice. This could have been our fault because we didn't get the bbq, but those at the table who had BBQ didn't seem to have anything special either. If it was half the price, I would consider going again. But for what we ate, and saw.... no.The decorations were beautiful, but the restaurant itself is very, very loud. Our server was great, but other staff was a bit intrusive. My partner only ate half his rice, and asked for the rest to be boxed. We never received it... a different server, said we could come back the next day for a fresh bibimbop, but really, I would have preferred my money back.

3.0,2/5/2018,"If you don't eat much Korean food then this is probably a good entry point. A suitable restaurant for the pre- or post-theatre crowd of tourists or out-of-towners. Trying the Kalbi Jim and Kalbi Tang, both were edible and well-seasoned. Not the best I've had, but decent execution. Agree with other reviewers this isn't as authentic a meal or experience as Ktown, and I missed my assortment of panchan. The panchan that we had wasn't bad, there was just wasn't much of it, and it was all vegetarian. A good amount of rice was served with the dishes though. ""Asian fusion"" is prob the best way to describe the decor--with intentional allusion to Asian fusion food which is often a mish mash of genres, techniques, and herbs & spices trying to be a mixture of multiple influences, but usually resulting in flavor without focus. It succeeded in establishing an oriental vibe, as authentic as Chinese take out is to real Chinese food. The service was effective. I felt no particular warmth or coldness.

We weren't given the restaurant week menu and had to ask for it ourselves. Food ($42/per person): Bo Ssam Bun (pork belly) Dark Nal Ke (chicken wings) - definitely have had better Bi Bim Bap - average but good portion size Omija Dragon - loved this dessert. The pastry was crisp and the berry mousse was refreshing but sweet at the same time The service was great, we were taken care of. I said don't come here for restaurant week is because it's not worth it. The reason my friend and I are so passionate about restaurant week is that we can afford to go to expensive restaurants that we normally wouldn't be able to. We paid $42 per person for dinner. If you order the same items a la carte, this is the breakdown: Appetiser: Chicken wings $13 Main: Bi Bim Bap $18 Dessert: Omija Dragon $8 That totals $39.

For appetizers, we got jap chae (a glass noodle dish - we got it with beef, but there's a vegetable version too). We also got the roast pork steamed buns. Three come in a serving. It was too spicy for my daughter, but she likes her food pretty mild. For dinner, she had bulgogi and I had the spicy pork. The meat is served raw and thinly sliced and you cook it on a grill that's built into the table. It's served with rice and lettuce for wrapping as well as kimchi and pickled daikon radish.

So I was a HUGE fan when Woo Lae Oak was open in Soho many years ago ... and I was told this was the "" sister restaurant"" and connected with that place. Trust me when I say- I was heart broken when Woo Lae Oak closed. It was in such a great location . Anyway lemme stop my rant lol. So - me and my one friend have been trying to find good Korean places similar to Woo Lae Oak every since. She did tell me about Bann a few years ago but we never went together.  So we searched high and low for good Korean places specifically to have delicious spicy pork. Most places were average or ok or the place was super traditional . I was looking for a Korean place with ambience and cocktails and slightly upscale. So finally - we decided to plan a dinner here! And I'm so happy we did! Bann is located on 50th street near 9th and 8th. Midtown is crazy most of the time. We were lucky to snatch up street parking for free but there are two parking garages on the same block. One that gave me a quote $25 on a Friday night thru a parking app. Just an FYI.  Otherwise there is a train stop for C and E one block away :)Bann is kinda in the cut... located circa Urban Plaza. There is a bar with bar tables when you walk. There is happy hour at the bar ONLY from 5-9! So worth it for you want cocktails like the delicious Lychee Martini which is the same when I was at Woo Lae Oak years ago . See happy hr menu in my photos Hall from the bar to the dining area were lined with boxes of chop sticks that belongs to frequent patrons JUST like it was at Woo Lae Oak There is a dining room in the back that has the traditional table stoves . You have the option of having them cook your food also but it's kinda fun to cook it yourself. The service was great. We were tended to right away and even the bus boys were very pleasant and attentive! The menu looked just like Woo Lae Oak from what I remembered.We decided to try the Bulgogi buns appetizer which were super tasty . Came with a total of threeMe and my friend both got the spicy pork. It comes with a salad and banchan. Even the ban Chan was higher quality than most Korean spots I've been too. Most of the time - I hardly touch the BanChan . You have the choice to get either white or multigrain rice. The spicy pork was so delicious and I was totally satisfied and happy.

It was my boyfriend's first time eating Korean so I was a little bummed, but all in all it was only fine. I would not return.Appetizers: Chicken wings and buns. I loved both, my boyfriend (who is a wing afficionado) was less than pleased with the wings. Wings were crispy and then covered in a slightly gooey, sweet brown/red sauce with sesame seeds on top. Had a nice level of spice and flavor but the sauce had a General Tso's chicken-esque feel to them. The buns were very fluffy, pork was thinly sliced (so no chunks of just fat, which I personally find gross). The buns also have a smokey sauce that is delicious and some crunchy pickled daikon is thrown in. Entrees: As everyone here said, the bulgogi beef is incredible. Wonderfully marinated, very thinly sliced so it cooks quickly, this is what you want to order - hands down. The Kalbi (which I had said was a nonnegotiable for our dinner because elsewhere I had had it and nearly lost my mind from how well marbled and tender this cut of meat usually is) was disappointing. It was cut in chunks instead of thinly sliced and had lots of gristle. It was the ultimate bummer of the meal. Still tasty but very chewy :(Dessert: I've never been keen on Asian desserts, this was in line with my expectations. The banana pudding tasted bitter like it was faintly flavored with liquor and the strawberry strudel thing was pretty dry and only mediocre.Service was fine for us, contrary to some of the reviews here. My cocktail was $13 and tasted pretty good but could have done better on presentation.My last remark will be on the palette cleansers/sides. This is one of my favorite parts of Korean food. These are a let down: kimchi, broccoli, pickled radish (which was also in our pork buns and served with our wings), and a side salad.It's a beautiful establishment and feels very fancy, but I would have taken somewhere dumpier for better quality food.

We had the mandu (dumplings) and chicken wings for appetizers and the dumplings were really great, especially with the sauce and seasoned/saucy lettuce they paired them with. Chicken wings were also good - just spicy enough for my tastes. Entrees: The Bulgogi was delicious with an amazing amount of flavor on the meat (and a TON of it) - this choice made the whole meal. I also love that you have a grill at each table, so you can cook the meat how you like it. We got the Bi Bim Bap in a hot stone bowl as the second entree, but I wasn't too blown away by it. It really lacked the flavor and spice kick I was looking for. To be a staple Korean dish, I just expected more.The desserts were good, too. Cool to try (banana sabayon - banana whipped custard with sesame seed dipped cookie; omija dragon - puff pastry layered with omija berry mousse, strawberries and ice cream) but not something I'd order again.The service was fantastic. Waters were never even close to being empty, our waiter made sure we had everything we needed and knew how to use the grill, and for such great attention the entire time, it never felt like too much. Overall, I'm glad I tried this place out during restaurant week so I could really get the full feel without paying an arm and a leg. I'd go back, but be strategic about what I ordered now that I know what's good and what's not my favorite.",0,0,0,Kaley R.,"Brooklyn, NY",164,264,392

1.0,6/18/2017,"The food was good, waiter was friendly.  The bathroom was unacceptable - My teenage daughter went to the bathroom by herself and the door had a strange handle, you have to push it all the way up anti clockwise to open the door  There is a sign that said push the handle up but a normal door handle up would be the original position of a door handle (not pushed down).  My daughter was stuck in the bathroom for 3 minutes without anyone hearing her cries for help, she tried to bang her shoulder against the door to get it open but no luck.  Finally someone opened the door for her from the outside.  I mentioned it to the maitre d', he just pointed to the sign as if why didn't you read that, the instruction was not clear nor conventional.  What if it was a 7 or 8 year old stuck in that bathroom?  My daughter now has a very sore shoulder traumatized.  Does this sound like a restaurant that takes care of their customers?  How much does it cost to install a normal door handle?  The door has a bolt, that means they do not even have to get a door handle that has a lock on it.  No food is worth a traumatized child.",0,0,0,Judy F.,"Manhattan, NY",0,5,0

I was mildly puzzled when I asked the bartender if he could change channels from women's collegiate softball to the NBA playoffs, he claimed he couldn't touch the tv. Despite this, I rate the HH a 5 star. As far as the dining room, it was nicely decorated and our server, Manny, was top-notch. The food, at least for me, was average. I had the already prepared pork belly. It was a plentiful portion, a little bit fattier than what I'm accustomed to. Sides of daikon and kimchi were fair, I've just had better (Koreatown in LA comes to mind). Others in my party of 6 got a variety of BBQ dishes. I noticed though that the 2 grills at our table were really small, and got kinda crowded with 5 people BBQ ing. After the meal, dishes were slow to be bussed from the table.

The bulgogi and salmon were also great, and I think just those two alone are perfect for two people. I loved the plum wine as well- it's not as sweet as it says on the menu but I prefer the taste of it to that of soju or makgeolli.

1.0,3/2/2017,"I was so excited to try some Korean BBQ on our business trip and introduce my colleague on how to cook dinner herself (exciting, right?). Unfortunately, we were left unimpressed.  First, there wasn't a lot of meat for $30, so be prepared to shell out $45/person on meat alone or fill up on the rice and veggies. Secondly, at other Korean restaurants I've been to, when you finish a veggie, they refill it. The waiters here did not. Third, keep an eye on these grills. The sides frame up pretty good while the rest of the grill isn't nearly as hot. It's a small grill. So we had to baby every piece of meat since it would either burn or not cook. Fourth, other places I've been to offer dipping sauces and salt. This place had none of that. Despite this, we couldn't pass up on the bar happy hour appetizer deals. Wish we had skipped this. The wings were ok. My colleague didn't enjoy the steamed pork belly buns. Dry small strip of meat with lots of radish/turnip. The ribs were the kicker. They had the texture of days old leftovers. This is the first time in my life I left an untouched rib on the plate. I mentioned to the waiter that the ribs were not good and old.

1.0,12/30/2016,"Stopped in earlier this week with my wife and three daughters hoping to have drinks and a few appetizers prior to catching a show. The restaurant looked inviting and the menu solid. We chose the restaurant based on the facts that they were advertising a handful of $6 appetizers and that there were only a few customers; we didn't have time to wait for a table. As soon as I took off my coat and let the waiter know we'd be keeping the fare relatively light, he suggested my family and I might be more comfortable in the bar, which is just a small sliver of an area with a few seats in the back. He said the $6 appetizers were only offered in the bar. I told him I understood, and we would order from the regular menu at full price. When he made the same suggestion about being more comfortable in the bar after I ordered drinks and three appetizers (about $65 worth), I offered to take my business elsewhere; he apologized and insisted we stay and enjoy ourselves. Within a minute of the waiter leaving our table, the manager came over and said if we were only going to order appetizers, we should sit in the bar--no longer a request. He said they were full tonight, despite at least 10 empty tables--only three other small parties in the restaurant. At this point, I left the restaurant after voicing my displeasure to both the waiter and the manager. As I walked out, the waiter said ""the water is on the house."" Classy. I have no idea how the food is, but the staff is rude and not welcoming. If you're operating a restaurant, you have to understand that not all customers will meet your spending expectations. Had the customer service come close to anything resembling decent, I'm sure I would be looking forward to a return trip for the full-meal experience and encouraging others to do the same.

I got the lychee martini, after being politely corrected for my pronunciation (leechee, not lye-chee), and it strangely tasted almost like a light beer. Not a bad thing? Anywa, on to the main course! I had the noodles with shrimp, and it was spectacular! I was so full, but could have eaten a ton more!The dessert included with the restaurant week promotion that I chose was the banana pudding. It was a bit unnecessary, because everyone was so full, but it was still very good. I wasn't a huge fan of the ""Sesame cookie"" in the pudding, but it was sitting on top and can easily be removed. It is very harsh tasting, which I'm sure is supposed to counter-balance the lightness of the banana pudding and strawberries, but I thought it was a bit excessive. Either way, the banana dish was also very good.They did not have a problem splitting our check onto ten credit cards(!), which I appreciated, as it made the whole process much easier.Well done!",2,0,1,Brian G.,"Astoria, Queens, NY",167,411,31
2.0,8/22/2016,"Overpriced and bad Korean/Korean fusion food.  The owner is very cheap.  Here's why:1.  We were seated next to the window and the table next to ours was barbecuing.  It was 86 degrees outside.  The air conditioning was not sufficient to cool the place down.  We were all very hot sitting there, making the meal uncomfortable.2.  The owner does not employ a hostess.  I was pointed to the main dining room to find my already-seated dinner mates (""Turn right at the corner"") The dining room is big, I was left to wander around.  Awkward.3.  Korean food usually comes with a ton of side dishes, our whole table ordered multiple entrees and there was one small container of rice for the four of us to share (instead of each getting our own bowl) and one small plate of sides (so tiny).  The quality of the food was also very...cheap.  I can't describe it.  Worst kimchee I've ever eaten.Service was very good.  I liked our waiter.",1,0,0,April Y.,"Manhattan, NY",0,196,0
2.0,8/19/2016,"Two stars because the food was actually pretty good. However, my good experience at the restaurant became bad due to the staff members. Our waiter was actually very kind at first even though it was hard for us to catch his attention since there were only two or three main servers running around handling all the tables while the rest were only allowed to bring us food but were unable to take orders and etc. Anyway, I ordered a to go order on a different bill to bring home to my sister at home at the end and then asked for the checks. When we got out check, there were two: one for the dinner we had with our party of 7 and the other was my separate to go check. There's a rule that if you have a party of 6 or larger then they charge you 20% gratuity so that showed up on our bill of about $230 I believe. But my to go order was also charged with 20% gratuity. I saw it on the check so I politely spoke to my server about it and said that there must've been a mistake since the to go order wasn't eaten here and I've never had that happen to me before. He responded that it's because we were eating here and so I told him that again that we didn't eat that order here at all. I order that separately because my sister hasn't eaten yet. He wasn't very happy that I wasn't going to give him 20% tip on two separate bills so he said with a lot of attitude ""fine then I'll go change it"" as he crumpled the receipt in my face to show how upset he was. He then came back with a new check with it taken off and threw it onto the table and rudely walked away. At this point, our entire party wasn't very happy with him so we didn't tip more than the 20% we already tipped. As we were leaving, my friends decided to have a drink in the other room where the bar was. After they ordered, the same server came over to point, whisper and laugh as he stared directly at us and told his fellow friend about us. I found that that was totally unprofessional to stand in front of a group of customers and talk badly about them right in front of them and to laugh, point and stare. It made my friends uncomfortable to enjoy their drink because they thought that maybe they were laughing because they did something to it. It would have been such a great experience if the staff members were more respectful towards their customers.",7,0,0,Anne L.,"Manhattan, NY",578,58,51

4.0,5/27/2016,"(I have to admit, I kind of felt like I was in an episode of Sex and the City)I had a date with a friend of mine and she suggested Bann. I am rarely in midtown and admittedly did not know what to expect. When we were escorted to our table, I was surrounded by high ceilings, huge pieces of E. Asian Art, large Buddhas, gorgeous archways and an aura that was perfect for a tv shoot. We were seated in the main dining room - it was relatively empty and the servers were really attentive (again, I'm usually dining at spots catered to hipsters in Brooklyn or family-owned restaurants in Queens, so I definitely felt pampered).  Our martinis were GORGEOUS. The lychee martini was perfect - not too sweet. My friend ordered the Saketini and it tasted like a spa. Then the appetizers came out... The presentation was enough to win me over. We ordered the ahi tuna sashimi, calamari and duk bokki. It was all tasty. The duk bokki was definitely not as spicy as it is at other Korean restaurants, nonetheless still tasty. It's important to note that this is an upscale Korean fusion restaurant. (I've stated in many reviews that my favorite Korean restaurants in the City are BCD Tofu House in Flushing and Cho Dang Gol in Manhattan. Those are excellent, though always crowded. I would go there for different reasons... Definitely not for drinks and appetizers). What is special about Bann is that those high ceilings, calming art, and ambiance create a *unique* space to bring out those fierce and necessary conversations that you can only have with your girlfriends.

Their regular white rice is really good of course too. Salad is great.The only downside is probably their tea, which always ends up overheating the cup itself but is itself not very hot actually.

4.0,4/30/2016,"While this was not the best Korean food I've ever had, it was solid and authentic enough and when combined with fast and attentive service, made for a very good dining experience.  To start, all tables come with grills which is not the case in all Korean restaurants- therefore we didn't have to make a special request.When we sat down a waiter came by right away to explain the menu and take our drink order.  We ordered various BBQ items including bulgogi and vegetables.  The price for the vegetables on the menu was a shocking $20 but it was a huge bowl of fresh veggies including beautiful, large mushrooms, peppers, carrots, plantains and more.  Maybe not $20 worth but certainly a generous serving.  The beef was delicious and it's always fun to grill your own meat.We also ordered the ginger soy glazed short-ribs which were not particularly tender or complex but were tasty nonetheless. The starter salads were fresh and yummy.  I missed the many small dishes of pickled veggies that are typical at authentic Korean restaurants but Bann had its own smaller version of these 'free' accompaniments.  We were in an out in under an hour and left feeling satisfied with the food.  Not a replacement for a Little Korea restaurant but we'll go back for a solid meal.",0,0,0,Roni J.,"Manhattan, NY",65,98,204

Happy hour is only at the bar - and they were disgustingly rude to guests saying that we are withholding space from other patrons (there was not a single soul waiting to be seated!). We felt so rushed and it was hours away from closing with no one waiting for a table, so why the rush, Bann?

So I took him up on his offer to go.I ordered the beef Bulgogi buns for appetizer. The sauce was nice ,lucid ,red, orange, and tangy. The beef was thin and a lean portion (thankfully) for an appetizer. Secondly, I ordered beef Bulgogi for the entree.  Everyone should keep in mind, you have to make the entree yourself, which is a different experience. That was a fun thing you don't do everyday. The sabayon is a great asset to the menu. It's light sweet, but not too sweet just right. I like that they added the fruit as well. It provides some type of acidity that the dessert needs. There is also a crunchy element to the dessert as well.  I left with a smile on my face. I say give this place a try, the service was inviting and it's a nice relaxing feel. I only give this place 4 stars and not five is because the meat could've had a little more flavor like a marinade instead of only relaying of the save to bring it out.",1,0,0,Quintin M.,"Seattle, WA",247,77,61

5.0,1/14/2016,"Yesterday was my second visit to Bann with a Groupon.  Happy Hour - I started in the lounge area with a few happy hour drinks at $6 each (regular price was around $12). The hot sake was good to warm up from the cold, and then I had two lychee martinis. They were good, and crept up on me so don't be fooled by the light sweetness. Dinner - Afterwards, we moved to the dining area which is nice and very classy chic, so don't come dressed in your sweatpants and a tee shirt if you don't appreciate a few awkward stares. My boyfriend and I both had the Dol Sot Bim Bim Bap with beef and it was delicious. Make sure to ask for the egg on the sunny side if you like it a bit runny and get it fried instead of raw. It was quite filling, but my bf was able to eat all of his, and still have room for dessert. I took half of mine home, and enjoyed it for lunch today. Dessert - We tried the Tropical Storm dessert ($9) which was amazing and a pretty large portion. It reminded me a lot of Halo Halo. The coconut ice cream has actual coconut pieces in it and everything together tasted really good. The total out of pocket for the meal, apart from the Groupon, would only have been about $15-$20, but dessert ran it up a few bucks more. The happy hour drinks were a completely different bill, and the Groupon does not cover Happy Hour specials, so I didn't include the money spent there in this review.",2,0,0,Lucy R.,"Manhattan, NY",180,13,18

3.0,11/28/2015,"This place is very confused in terms of trying to balance the virtues of an authentic Korean bbq location and one that appeals to Westerners. Now, I understand that saying this is very controversial. As the two are supposedly to be able to co-exist...however, this location makes it difficult because the dishes and the servings are very questionable. My friend and I came here and order the BBQ platter which was stated to be for 2-4 people. The dish was sufficient for 2 (and I don't eat much anyways) and out of the 4 types of meat on the dish only two were traditional (Kalbi and Bulgogi)....the Kalbi saved the day but the others (Salmon and shrimp) was mediocre at best (despite the menu having italics to emphasize that the dishes were very traditional and representative). The price of this platter at 95 dollars is ridiculous for what it includes. Further the 3 side dishes that accompany the meal is laughable.

My parents who are in their 70's don't care for this restaurant.  They would rather go to K-town to have good old BBQ and Chigae with a table overflowing with Banchan that includes raw crab and pickled raddish.,0,0,0,Susan L.,"Dix Hills, NY",168,450,576

2.0,8/23/2015,"My boyfriend and I went here for dinner during restaurant week. Decent Korean food is the best I could say. I started with the Cham Chi Hwe (ahi tuna) and my boyfriend had the Bo SSam Bun (pork belly steamed buns). The tuna was actually horrible, it did not taste fresh at all and had a slimy consistency. It was cut into thin strips that created a terrible texture to the fish. It came with a sauce on the side that was so powerful, it eliminated all taste of the fish, which was a good thing I guess in this situation. The pork belly buns were served thrown on a small plate and plated very messy and carelessly. The buns were very sticky and were undercooked. Still, this was better then the tuna sadly.For the main course we both decided to try the korean barbecue. I had the Dae Ji (spicy pork) and my boyfriend had the Bulgogi (rib eye). This was the best part of the meal and honestly the only reason why I am giving this restaurant even 2 stars. My pork had amazing flavor and was delicious. My boyfriend said his beef was amazing and he loved it. My only critique with the entrees is that the korean barbecue came with a lot of sides and sauces but we were given no direction as to what to do with them, so we ended up just cooking the protein and leaving everything else. For dessert we tried the carrot cake and banana custard. They were good but certainly nothing special. Even with the flaws in the food, I have to say my biggest issue with this restaurant was the service. We started with 2 different specialty cocktails. My boyfriend did not like his and immediately put it to the side intending to order a different one. The server never came over and asked him if he wanted something else, despite him making it very clear that he was not drinking his existing. I finished my martini and easily would have ordered a second, if I was even asked. These are 2 drinks that the server could have added to our check, if he cared enough to check in on us. No one there seemed to care about the diners or the experience they were having.Needless to say, next time we are craving some Korean barbecue we will head else where.",2,0,0,Molly S.,"Long Island City, NY",96,89,144

So I had a high expectation of this place when I visited for lunch on a weekday, but I was very disappointed. Because I went with a large group, we got several dishes to share: cham chi hwe (ahi tuna sashimi), mandu (fried dumplings with shrimp), dak nal ke (fried chicken wings), pa jun (scallion pancake with seafood) and duk bokki (spicy rice cake). They were all mediocre and bland in general, with an exception of dak nal ke which was pretty tasty. Then we got the large barbecue platter, which is an assortment of various meat, fish and veggie you get to grill yourself at the table. The meat and fish were okay, but nothing spectacular. At the $125 price tag, you can get much better quality in K-town restaurants or Gyu-kaku.Also, the service staff was rather cold and not so helpful with recommendations, despite the fact that the restaurant was practically empty when we were there. In sum, if you're craving Asian BBQ in the area, walk a few blocks down to Gyu-kaku (Japanese BBQ), or if you're in the mood for some Korean food in general, just walk a few more blocks down to K-town.",0,0,0,Elle C.,"Manhattan, NY",21,331,0

I felt that just 1 little bowl of rice was not enough for 2 people, but maybe I just really love rice & didn't want to share with my friend. Still, they could have offered to bring more plain, white rice when they saw I had demolished it before our meat was cooked.The salmon BBQ is a way better deal than the shrimp. Both are $26, but mine had only 5 shrimp, and my pal had 8 pieces of salmon. The glaze on the shrimp was too sweet for my liking, but the salmon was perfection.Actually doing the grilling yourself takes some practice, but it's fun! We learned to turn down the heat to a low-medium, and take our time grilling the seafood.There is a soy-ginger sauce that comes with the meal, and I could eat it by the spoonful. Also wish they would have brought more of that.The serving sizes were smaller than average, but tasty nonetheless. They always filled our waters, but we couldn't get the Happy Hour drink specials unless we moved to the bar.The only other downside was where we were seated. They put us along the wall, next to the bathrooms. We had a big tray to our right, where the busboys would toss the used plates from other tables, with used napkins and half eaten food near our faces.

The pajun was piping hot and served with a soy sauce with red chili peppers. The combination of the crispy exterior and the chewy, almost mochi like inside of the pancake was delicious. While I love the green peppers in the pancake, I thought it was a little overpowering overall.The bulgogi buns were served drizzled in sauce and topped with julienned daikon radish.

1.0,5/23/2015,"FAIR FOOD, BAD SERVICE AND QUITE LIKELY A SCAM. I was excited to eat at this Korean BBQ and had a Groupon for the meal. The waiter insisted on taking my phone to the register, even before I hit the ""view voucher"" button. When he returned to the table, he said that the Groupon had already been redeemed. I told him I had bought it 10 minutes before, and that it could not have been redeemed by anyone other than him. He continued to argue with me--which I now feel was an attempt to have me buy another Groupon or pay for the meal without a Groupon. Eventually, he acquiesced and we proceeded to order. The waiter continued to act indignant and made ordering difficult.The meal was fair and my brother and I enjoyed the Korean BBQ style dining. I paid with my card and left a generous tip, despite the shoddy service. I realized later that my card had never been returned to me and called Bann Restaurant to ask if they had it. They said they didn't have it among 20 CREDIT CARDS IN THEIR LOST AND FOUND, but took my information in case they had missed it. I promptly cancelled my card at my bank and was informed that someone had been making charges on it. 30 minutes after my card was cancelled, Bann Restaurant called me to say that they had found it. I asked them why there had been charges on the card, and they insisted that the card had been there at the restaurant the whole time. I told them again that there had been charges on the card and they didn't offer to explain why.Save your money, try a different restaurant.

2.0,5/22/2015,Bann... More like Badd Restaurant. I live in the area so I was looking forward to trying it out. After this experience I will either stick with Danjii or 32nd street. First of all we got served three ban chan.  I'm not sure what korean restaurant serves such few ban chan. The kimchi was really salty and the broccoli was bland. Secondly there was an eyelash in our main dish!  I told the waiter who then tried to convince me that it was HAIR ON THE SQUASH (I had ordered the kalbi Jim). I told him no that's an eyelash and took a photo because he pried the dish away and tried to run away with it. He came back and apologized and said the kitchen would make a new one... Which ended up taking 30 minutes. By that point we just wanted to leave. I'm giving it two stars because the lychee martini was actually pretty good.,0,0,0,Andrew C.,"New York, NY",56,8,4

1.0,5/10/2015,"To start off, we decided to try out Bann Restaurant after purchasing their Groupon (Pay $20 for $40 worth) offer.  This was honestly the worst experience ever. To start, as we proceeded into the restaurant, the atmosphere was dated and dark.  We then proceeded to the main dining area where we sat there for a few minutes with our menu.  After selecting our meal, ""Dol Sot Bbap (Beef) BBQ"" we waited for a few minutes for it to arrive.  So far the experience was OK.  Thinking back, once our waiter took our order, he vanished and didn't arrive back until it was time to get the check.  The meal well, for $23 dollar Korean BBQ Sizzling Bowl it was TERRIBLE.  The bowl was 90% rice, 5% vegetables and 5% beef.  As for the beef, I was expecting it to be just cooked - well it didn't seem to taste that way, it was cool (not even warm).  Since the bowl was hot, we decided to lay the beef around it hoping that it would quickly warm up. As for the rice, 20% of it was crunchy and burnt.  After chewing though the huge bowl of basically burnt rice and vegetables, my jaw decided to hurt.  As we came to a conclusion with our meal - being awful as it was we were excited that we had a Groupon.  That was suppose to soften the blow of eating a crappy meal since we were going to save $20.  As our waiter arrived, we presented our Groupon and was told ""today is a holiday, we don't accept Groupon on Holidays"".  I quickly looked to my wife and said ""Is mothers day an official holiday?"" - The answer to that is NO.  Mother's Day is an ""Observance Day"" not an official public holiday. You don't get a day off of work - its not Christmas, New Years, or Thanksgiving etc.  I asked our waiter Christian for a manager, and soon after Julie Choi came over.  I explained to her that we purchased a Groupon and was told it was not being accepted as today (Mother's Day) was a holiday.  Julie looked at me and said yes its a holiday. I told her, that she was mistaken that Mother's Day is an Observance Day and to provide a bit more clarity - I showed her the US Governments website which list all public holidays followed by Observance Day along with the Groupon that states holiday then goes on to list Valentines Day.  No where did they list Mother's Day.Julie then began argue with me - Stating that she didn't what I though or said, mothers day was a holiday and not an Observance Day.  She then proceeded to tell me that she was Korean and didn't believe in Christmas + talking about holidays around the world (WHO CARES).  Pretty much she started rambling about crap. I had gotten to the point where I was losing my patience and she wasn't worth my time.As a planner who works with many restaurants in NYC (both big and small), I have never experience such terrible service EVER. I will NEVER eat again at Bann Restaurant nor will I ever recommend it to any of my clients or colleagues.  The manager was terrible and should be fired - to argue with your customer when you are CLEARLY wrong was disgusting just like the meal we ate.I WISH I COULD HAVE GIVEN THIS ""0"" STARTS but Yelp doesn't have that feature.  Two thumbs down on Bann Restaurant and shame on their manager Julie Chio (if thats even her real name).Overall RatingService - Slow and unattentive service Cost - PricyTaste - BlandRecommendation - Looking for great Korean Cuisine, check out Don's Bogam - 17 E 32nd Street, New York, NY 10016.  We were introduced to this place by a friend of mine and loved it.  We had high hopes for Bann but got worst experience ever.",4,5,1,Dillon C.,"New York, NY",16,16,39

3.0,3/7/2015,"NY Restaurant Week food frenzy - Bann was Day 1 of 5 straight evenings of dining.The entrance to Bann isn't right off the street that the building is located on, even though there's a door (I tried to open it, it was locked, so embarrassing...); you walk into the rear of this plaza alongside the building, and enter through the back lounge adjacent to the main dining area.I arrived very early for my reservation, and I was immediately accommodated, which was well appreciated. The space itself was dimlit and relaxing, warm and open, with large windows that offered a nice view of the outside. The noise level was Average/Quiet, and it looked like single diners and large groups alike could be seated at a busy prime dinner time, which is nice plus.My server Christian was great; I asked for suggestions and he actually recommended NOT getting the Salmon Korean BBQ, which was interesting. I never had KBBQ before, so I was excited to try it for the first time. Apparently, beef is the way to go with Korean BBQ, so if you're not getting beef, don't bother with it; I respect his honesty in that.I found an alternative that was pretty good - Bann Gooksu - which was a stir fried noodle dish, loaded with veggies in a rich soy and garlic sauce. The entree came with a good-sized side salad, side of Korean cole slaw, a cold eggplant side dish, and a small side of diced cucumber. So much food! (I took the remainder of what I couldn't finish back home).Prior to the main course, I ordered the Ke Sal Mari as a starter (crab and leek wrapped in spinach crepes), which while very small, was very good. For dessert, I had the Carrot Cake.Overall, the servers and waitstaff were very friendly, and though the food was good, it didn't really knock my socks off.

Tender, fall off the bone pork, but I still licked the bones.The Kal Bi Jim short ribs were nice, tender and a good comfort food item, seasoned well, but didn't trump my ribs. The Korean BBQ seemed like work, although the side dishes were plentiful and wonderful looking, I realize I could go elsewhere for that.Carrot cake dessert was rich, moist, mega sweet, and pleasing to look at.

I had only tried KBBQ one time before and for the most part, I enjoyed the experience, but I was underwhelmed by the limited menu. Luckily for us, that was not the case here, at Bann! The menu is extensive and there is definitely something for everybody.We kicked off the meal with:- Bul go gi buns (beef), which I had really high expectations for, but it just was not the taste I typically enjoy. This opinion is probably just based on personal taste, not on the restaurant's behalf because most people at our table enjoyed them.- Shrimp + beef mandu, which were delicious. I personally preferred the beef dumplings over the shrimp, and the dipping sauce that came with both was delicious.- Vegetarian pa jun, which I thought would be identical to a scallion pancake; it was good, but the scallion pancakes I'm used to are better.- O jing aw tikim (calamari), which everybody seemed to love!- Dak nal ke, delicious chicken wings! A little spicy, but SO GOOD.We then moved onto the BBQ portion of our meal, ordering 3 of the large BBQ platters (each enough for 4 to 6 people), which includes: beef short rib, beef rib tips, filet mignon, duck breast, shrimp + salmon. All very tasty! I really enjoyed the marinade used on the meats, no complaints here whatsoever. The house salad included for each person with the BBQ platters was also good and very complimentary to the taste of the BBQ items.Lastly, dessert... The Soju Banana Sabayon was PERFECT and honestly, one of the best things I've ever tasted in my life. I would keep going back just for this tasty treat. DELICIOUS. All in all, dinner was great as far as food, drinks + service. KBBQ creates a great atmosphere for socializing and eating, since you BBQ your own food at the table.

The vegetables were the greatest disappointment which leads to why this is two stars instead of three.The Ban Chan was so mediocre!  Sliced cucumber with a touch of salt and something.  Kimchee was not spicy and tangy enough.  One ban chan was a sald wth dressing.  The veggies on the Bi Bim Bop where grated zucchini and carrots with no flavor and spinach that was defrosted and dumped on top.  It was meal without soul and purpose.One more thing I have noticed in midtown, the bartender was Russian(great guy, good service, no issue) but Russian in a Korean restaurant.  The girls at the bar, Russian.  Went to an Irish place on 41st, Russian.  Very weird vibe coming into midtown.Anyhow, drive further, get something authentic.  This was a huge disappointment and I have had better Korean 4 out of 5 places.",2,0,0,Tom K.,"Crystal River, FL",48,105,8

Everything is pretty modern, clean, and it wasn't really busy Service: (1/5) we sat down looked at the menu, decided what we wanted and then proceeded to wait 10-15 minutes for someone to acknowledge us. We finally decided to wave down a busser to see if he could get a server for us. 5 minutes later a server finally came over to us. We gave our orders in. As we were waiting for our food we saw guests coming in and were greeted right Away by the same server we had. Our server didn't check on us to see if we were ok like he was doing for his other tables. Every time we needed something we had to constantly wave him down or ask a busser. When we finished eating we got our check. Our server took our payment but didn't even have the decency to at least drop it off and say good night or anything like that. A busser came and gave us our credit card slip. Horrible Service. Food: (2/5) Food came out in about 15 minutes which was pretty good. The food was just ok.

4.0,2/4/2015,"I came here twice - once in HS, when I don't think Yelp existed or I didn't know if it, and one recently with an old client of mine that was visiting from Cancun. She was visiting and wanted Korean... I didn't want to take her to a place that I couldn't even handle ordering so we came to Bann, because it's a bit more ""Americanized"" and ""fancier"" though I knew it was going to be pricier. The ambiance is great, of course and we had a nice table in the corner. The waiter was very attentive and able to make suggestions for appetizers and explain what certain food was to my guest. We got the scallop appetizer and pajun, which I've had many many times but it really was one of the best I've had. Very doughy but still crispy in areas and filled with tons of seafood. The stuffed scallop was really tasty, as well.For entrees, we shared an order of kalbi (without bones), and dol sot bi bim bap. We stayed simple but it was delicious. The meat was plentiful (I thought it was going to be like... 4 pieces) and tender. We had to pack up most of the bi bim bap but the little I had, was good.I was very impressed and even though it's on the pricier side, it wasn't terrible (came out to around $120 total) as we had a good amount of dishes.I'm looking forward to coming here for HH as the sign was intriguing ($5-$6 cocktails, and $6 small bites).",2,0,1,Danielle T.,"Port Washington, NY",446,405,113

Came around Christmas time, the interior is SO beautifully decorated to a point that the ambiance itself is captivating. Very modern, very clean, gorgeous.

I try to never do that, but the staff was nonetheless courteous, professional, and informative, especially regarding the 700 questions I asked. Cannot remember the name of the drink I had, but it was both delicious and strong. You would be surprised how hard it is for bartenders to serve up equal portions of palatable and strong drinks, Bann did an excellent job! Felt the effects of the alcohol for sure, but didn't feel like I was chugging nail polish remover in the process. We went with the Korean BBQ options, but had the chefs cook it for us, due to time's sake. I got the boneless, beef, short-rib. DEAR LORD!!! This was definitely the most tender, flavorful meat I have had. Sooooo good. My boyfriend got the chicken, which was also good, but not as good as mine!

I filled myself up with the white rice and whatever of the beef that was edible !The waiter never came by to refill my water or ask me about the food !I finally asked for the check and to my surprise I was charged $13 for the spicy chicken wings that was advertised for $6 .When I questioned the waiter , he explained that that price applied only to the bar people and that the price for the dinning room was $13 .To add salt to the injury , I noticed a 20% service charge for a very meager service that I had received ! Again , questioning the waiter he stated to me that it was authorized by Living Social which after questioning Living Social I found out was a LIE !

Calamari was unremarkable and cut into shreds until unrecognizable. Vegetables tasted simply boiled. Almost every seat in this restaurant has limited leg space because of the grill in the middle of the table, making it very uncomfortable. The banchan (free small plates) are nothing to write home about -- which is sad, because they're usually the pride and joy of the house.

This place is really top notch. I've been about 6 times in the last few months and I live nowhere near this place. I hold Korean food to a very high regard, it must be tasty, relatively inexpensive and better than most places I frequent. Bann is absolutely worth trying. The atmosphere is very trendy and great for dates or social gatherings, I've brought my kids here and they are extremely accomodating as well, they provide training chopsticks and give the kids cups with lids and straws. Appitizers are really good, ranging from Jap Chae to other things like dumplings they have quite a few exotics mixed in such as Steak Tartare, and a chopped tuna sashimi style, main dishes are delicious and portions are huge, Korean BBQ portions for tabletop BBQ are decent enough to be shared with 2-3 people, and if you order more than one meat you will have more than enough food. Beers and Soju are available and the dessert selection is great. the molten chocolate cake is really top notch as is the banana soju creme brulee.Parking is fairly difficult if you go towards the middle avenues, however if you park closer to the west side it's easier to find street parking.

Once everything was on the table, the waiter never came over once and never refilled the water. We presented our groupon and when the bill came he charged us 20% gratuity already included. Nowhere on the menu/restaurant or groupon did it say that there was an added 20% gratuity. As soon as we mentioned this to the waiter he told us that was the policy and brought over a manager.

I recently went to Bann for dinner with three friends, and our plan was to order some Korean BBQ. We were seated at a table, and our waiter removed the cover from our in-table grill. I noticed that our grill pan was dirty and previously used, and asked our waiter to please change it out. His response was, ""Why?"", and I pointed to the grill and told him that it was dirty and not changed from the previous diners. The waiter said that it was fine, and that it was OK to use. I insisted that they change it out, and reluctantly he did so, but I was shocked at how difficult it was for them to fulfill my request. I literally could have taken a spoon and scraped up some gunk off of the surface of the grill. To accompany our dinner that evening, I ordered a bottle of red wine. After a short while, the waiter came back with the wrong bottle, and I told him that it was incorrect and that I had ordered a different bottle. He apologized and told me that they were out of the original bottle that I had ordered, but decided to bring this other bottle instead. This other bottle was more expensive than the original one I had ordered, and he decided to bring it out instead without asking me which other wine I would have preferred. The food at Bann is subpar compared to other Korean restaurants. The selection of ban chan (side dishes) is very limited compared to most other Korean restaurants in Ktown, and the portion of Korean BBQ is very small relative to the price. The food here is unnecessarily expensive, and you will end up leaving unsatisfied and hungry. To top off the evening, Bann charged an automatic 20% gratuity to my bill for a group of four diners.

The one star reduction is simply for the woman who answered the phone when we made the reservation (we told her upfront about our travelzoo deal and she treated us a little on the secondary side) and the manager who seemed extremely elitist but was still cordial and diplomatic. Whatever. Our waiter more than made up for it and I wish I could remember his name because he made us feel comfortable and put us at ease when we mentioned our travelzoo deal.

This place is overpriced and the food is NOT authentic. $18 for any of the soups and it tastes like a bad version of the real thing. If you go anywhere in Koreatown on 32nd between Fifth Ave and Broadway, you will pay $5-8 less than what you're paying at Bann and the food will actually taste like Korean food. The only reason I think people go here is cause of groupon deals (I saw a lot of people using the same thing I had) and possibly for business/birthday dinners. Yes, the atmosphere is nicer than a casual korean restaurant but why would you want to go to a place that overcharges and tastes bland and boring? It strikes me as a place that is more focused on presentation than the actual food. If you need a place that is just as nice with the atmosphere and presentation, there are other places on 32nd Street in ktown that I would go to. I haven't been writing many reviews lately because I'm lazy but I feel like I really wasted my money here and disappointed so wanted to review this place. The side dishes (banchan) sucked.

3.0,11/25/2014,"I agree with what other people say about this place. It's Americanized korean style food so you won't be getting that korean authenticity from it. Everything seems to be half way of what it's supposed to be. It's still tasty but not in the traditional way. If anything, ktown would taste just the same. The price is slightly more expensive than ktown for what you order, but I believe this is because of its location and the fancy ambiance. Haven't had the BBQ tho. Bbq is good is what I hear.

4.0,11/22/2014,"I got a Groupon, $40 worth of food for half the price. i went to Bann on Saturday at noon. It was quiet and the decor was nice, like most upscale restaurants in Hells Kitchen. I ordered steak tartare, fried rice, and o mi cha dragon for desert. It was a little over $40.Food: the steak tartare was a little frozen, it was good but wish it was served on right temperature. I had to wait a while to eat it cause it was a bit icy... and I also had to ask for some hot sauce to go with it. (Just my preference. I am Korean and Koreans like it spicy!) I wasnt given an egg to go with it. Maybe i had to ask for it? Overall, 3/5 Fried rice was very good. Generous amount, great taste with no artificial ingredients. Kimchi in the rice tasted great. 5/5But, kimchi on the side dish was not so good.... it tasted like Americanized kimchi, too sweet and dull. By the way there were 4 side dishes. They were all just ok. Lacked authentic Korean taste.:The desert O mi cha dragon which is a pastry puff with strawberries and cream was presented so beautifully, and it also tasted amazing. it wasnt too sweet, the pastry puff went well with the cream and strawberries. 5/5The service: the waiter did his job well. But his attitude was a bit sharp.. please smile next time! :) 4/5There was 20% gratuity... i guess it was worth it.Overall, good Korean food in upscale setting. if i paid the full price, i wouldnt be as satisfied, but with the Groupon, i think i had a good dining experience.",0,0,0,EJ C.,"Boca Raton, FL",16,55,114

4.0,11/5/2014,"I really enjoyed this taste of Korea in Manhattan. We had the option of cooking the food ourselves or having it come from the kitchen. We went with the later, as we figured they probably knew what they were doing better than us. Cooking yourself, definitely adds to the experience though!. The kimchi was fantastic, the bulgugi also very good, but what stood out the most to me, was the short ribs. What a tasty treat. I would have liked to have seen things a little spicier (more akin to the food I had in Seoul) but when I asked for spice they happily obliged. They had a very tangy house made ssiracha type sauce (which I thought was fantastic) and make sure you ask for the dipping sauce as well. Both of these accentuated the dishes and made them even tastier. The service was good and atmosphere also delightful. All and all we truly enjoyed this experience. We originally were going to get the small BBQ but our waiter advised us it would be too much food (made for 3 +). It is a good thing we didn't go that route as we barely could eat what we did get.

I was dressed casually and had a Groupon.  The waiter was very welcoming and asked if I had any questions about the food.  I explained that I had eaten a spicy pork dish in San Francisco the previous week and would like something like that.  He made a recommendation for a dish as well as a wine.  Fantastic!!!

The space is pretty big, plenty of tables that are flexible. So it can either be small group or also can accommodate large group of people as well.You can see partial of their open kitchen which is unique for a korean restaurant, and hey, that means they aren't hiding anything!

(And i never say this) were all very tasty.Both galbi & dweji galbi were fusion. So It was a different sauce they marinated in.Chicken wings were dipped in the spicy sweet sauce which was very delicious! Dolsot bibbimbab was full of veggies and the portion was huge!

Other than that, service is great! I've heard that people come here for Restaurant Week; I never have and I recommend not. The portions and what they offer are not worth the price. I personally love the Bo Ssam, Kimchi Jaeyook, and the Pork Buns as appetizers. I've pretty much had everything on the menu and because I'm Korean, there are certain dishes I would never get(Jap Chae, Korean Pancake, etc.) because I can just make those at home or get them for much cheaper elsewhere.I'm giving it a 4 because I've had some very bad experiences with the owner and that doesn't merit a 5 star rating.

Dining partner and I got a little ambitious, ordered the dukbokki and kimbap to share, dol sot bibimbap for him, and the jae yook for me. MAYBE the best dukbokki I've had thus far, although I wouldn't call myself a connoisseur. Incredibly light, fluffy rice cakes, mixed with sweet, spicy, red pepper sauce, bits of meat tossed in. Kimbap and bibimbap were solid but I wouldn't say that either stood out from their Ktown competitors. My jae yook was way too salty, someone was very heavy handed. I took a few bites and passed the rest along to my companion. Not a bad Korean spot outside of Ktown but not the best.

Everyone had something different..I chose beef, the bday boy chose lamb--both of ours needed to be BBQ'd, and the others chose pork ribs, chicken wings and whatever else non-memorable.Someone ordered a specialty rice which was AMAZING..a little spicy but the flavors hit the spot. The key dishes were the lamb--when BBQ'd right, the chicken wings and the Pork ribs. I'm not too familiar with the condiments they gave us but the spicy cabbage one worked well with the white rice--added a kick and punch.The bill was def $$$, unfortunately why they didn't get a 5 star from me--this would be better as a $$ due to portion sizes.Altogether, great atmosphere, especially for big groups, attentive and friendly waitstaff-they were quick in delivering and clearing tables, and can't forget the bartender.

4.0,3/10/2014,"Came here for dinner before a Broadway show! When I first Yelped the spot, I was quite hesitant, but I'm glad I went in for dinner regardless. This is located in the Theater District, so they are by no means catering to ""K-town customers"". And by that I mean, they're not exactly the most authentic! The portions are small and you do not get about 6-10 side dishes. On my trip here, there were only 3, but I only ever eat the kimchi anyways. Keeping these things in mind, I tried the kalbi ($30), spicy pork tenderloin (~$23/24), and the kimchi jiggae ($16). All the meats were delicious!! The kalbi had no bone, which was perfect since I didn't want to get my hands dirty. The spicy pork tenderloin was different from any I've ever had. I would assume most people like their pork with some fat in it, but I simply DO NOT. All lean and thin cuts of pork with just the right amount of spicy sauce. The kimchi jiggae was HUGE portion wise and was a little too salty (as expected). I actually took half of it to go so I could water it down for lunch the next day. Overall, A GREAT DINNER SPOT and for those thinking of a cute date spot, THIS IS IT! The atmosphere was very intimate. The lighting was (very) dim and romantic.

5.0,3/3/2014,"Came to Bann for Winter Restaurant Week. I knew going in that it was more of ""Asian fusion that leans slightly to the Korean side of the spectrum"". My friend has never ventured into Korean cuisine before and we were itching to escape from the cold and have a nice, relaxing, inviting meal. We reserved a table beforehand, which they honored as soon as we got there. The inside was very dim, very modern with Asian influence. I'm glad I came in my work attire. If I wore jeans, I would have felt under-dressed. We were led through a bar area, several side rooms and then sat in the main dining area. It was very spacious and intimate in nature.We received our Restaurant Week menu, which gave a nice assortment of options to choose from. Our waiter was very kind and patient when deciding what to order. And he answered some of our questions graciously. I ended up deciding on the Bulgogi Buns for the appetizer, the Kalbi Jim for my main and the Banana Sabayon for dessert.-Bulgogi Buns:Comes with two. The steamed buns were light, fluffly and held together despite the generous amount of beef rib eye and spicy daikon. It wasn't all that spicy in my opinion, but it delicious nonetheless.-Kalbi Jim:The star of the meal. If you're a meat-lover, go for the kalbi. You can't go wrong. They not only gave us a generous portion (considering it was a price-fixe), but it was also plated beautifully. The beef was incredibly tender yet super flavorful and that sake ginger soy glaze enhanced it all. I savored every. single. bite.-Banana Sabayon:I have to admit... this is my first experience with sabayon. For those of you that aren't familiar with this dish, it's a very light/airy custard served with fruit. I heard great things. Let's just say I was transported to heaven as soon as I took my first spoonful. It was super silky and decadent. And despite that I don't usually enjoy ""banana flavored"" things, I loved this.Bann may not be traditional, but it is delicious. From seeing what others have said, I can agree on the letdown of authentic options. However, from my experience here, everything was on par. No complaints from me.

Bann definitely know what they are doing. The Bo Ssam was very delicious and extremely fulfilling. It's good for two people. However, the waiter was very annoying in insisting that we ""HAVE"" to order at least 2 entrees (probably because he is afraid that our tip would be so small with just one entree). My friend and I have never seen a waiter so rude because you don't tell your customer what to do. As a customer, I order whatever I want. I have been here so I know that one Bo Ssam is good for two people. We went ahead and ordered 2 entrees anyway, only because my friend wanted to try more dishes. Anyway, the waiter kept on checking on us in a very annoying way and we were not happy about the service at all. I still gave it 4 stars because the food has never disappointed me. The Duk Gukk is especially good and anyone who prefer less specify Korean food should try this. My first time visiting Bann a few months back was very pleasant. We went for lunch and had an awesome and polite waiter. My friend even thought he was cute. But this time, with a different waiter, things were a lot different.

4.0,2/21/2014,I came here recently with my husband  before seeing a play and was pleasantly surprised. I had not heard about this place before but found it online when searching for Asian restaurants in the area. The restaurant is spacious and modern and we were greeted by a friendly host. We shared two appetizers  - ribs and fried dumplings and they were delicious. The ribs were tender and the meat fell off the bone. Presentation was also great. I ordered a beef stir fry and my husband opted for the Korean BBQ. He decided to let the chef cook it but was offered the option to cook it himself at the table. Lots of vegetable sides arrived with his steak and he was very happy. For dessert we shared a pastry and fruit mousse dish (I cannot remember what it was called) and it was excellent. Again the presentation was fantastic. We received great service from the waiter and busboys and they were incredibly attentive. My only minor issue was the cocktail I received. It was called Asian Glow however it didn't taste very strong. Perhaps it wasn't what I'm used you and it did taste nice but for the price I would expect more of a kick!

I don't know - it was like so smooth and tasty and slightly crunchy and melty and that miso paste you put in there - well, I think if it were legal, I might marry that sauce.So, for me, the meat was the main attraction - I don't know what they did to it before I met it - but I am glad they did.  I can't stop thinking about that Salmon.  Oh Salmon of my dreams, you call to meeeeeee.OK - I am going to stop now.  My friend loved his beef, but I draw the line at tongue, unless it's connected to a cute guy from Nicaragua and still very much alive.  We were totally full at the end of it - so no need for appetizer or dessert, which is cool, cause without my dear cousin Groupon, this place is a bit pricey.  But who can put a price on love, I ask you?",1,7,1,Steven K.,"New York, NY",233,127,42

I was so impressed with this restaurant the décor is beautiful and I loved the vibe of the place and the layout. I am a huge fan of Korean bbq so I was very excited every table has their own grill in the middle of the table. But we ended up ordering from the lunch specials menu which was very filling. The beef was soft and very well marinated. I loved the sauce that came with the Korean pancakes. I am not a huge fan of kimchi but their kimchi was very mild so I was able to eat it with the white rice. The Korean miso bean soup was a little spicy but tasty.

They need to turn their AC down or ON since people are BBQ'ing.  Must have been 80+ degrees in there. We were prespiring for most of the dinner.They bring you whatever meat item you order in a cute box. Meat isn't really seasoned with anything.  Also, our waiter didn't bring any sauces until we asked.  BBQ sauce is very watery and doesn't have much flavor. They brought out soy sauce as well.They give you plain white rice, cucumbers and about a tablespoon of Kim Chi. The lychee martini was really good and worth every penny of $11.  Nicely chilled with good flavor.The food is overpriced for the Korean BBQ. They need to give more sides and need to give something other than plain lettuce with 2 carrots and 2 cucumbers.They added 18% to our bill which was annoying since it wasn't written anywhere on the menu.

I made a last minute reservation over the phone the night before we went  and unfortunately when we walked in, they had no reservation listed under my name.  That was a little disappointing because there were no tables available and I had no proof either (opentable IS your friend marina!). They did have a long shared table facing the kitchen though and because we were pressed on time- we decided to suck it up and take it.We still received great service, awesome meal suggestions and enjoyed our time regardless of ""the view"". The grill space at our table didn't work either but hey, the grill in the kitchen was a few feet away so I didn't mind that they had to cook our meat instead.We ordered a round of specialty cocktails (nothing to write home about) along with a chicken rice bowl (DOL SOT BI BIM BAP) and an order of Korean BBQ, thinly sliced beef rib eye (BUL GO GI). The rice bowl was delish but lord almighty- the beef rib eye with sauteed onions was DIVINE- DREAMWORTHY- AMAZING! I promise you I'm not lying!

They choose a piece of art work to display on their wall and I think it means mortality. They also had famous celebrities sign some kind of wood box which they also display out in the opening when you walk in to be seated. (****) I sample my friend's dukboki and I didn't think it taste authentic. The sauce was very light (kind of like a brown sauce) and it wasn't that spicy. I had the fried chicken wings as my appetizer and I thought it taste good, but I had better. I'm guessing they didn't really stock in good chicken wings since I had difficulty getting all the meat off the bone. I think they used the sweet chilly sauce on the chicken wing.  The meat was very moist however so it wasn't dried at all. (***)For my Entree I had the Korean Grill (Rib eye). You have the choice to grill it yourself or have them do it for you in the kitchen. It comes with lettuce wraps, rice, and 3 small sides. The rib eye was very tender and juicy. Don't over grill it though otherwise it could get dry. Also they gave a chilly dressing salad. I don't usually eat salad, but this salad was sooooo good. (****)For Dessert I had the omicha berry cream & strawberry pastry. I would definitely get this again if I come here. Think of flaky pastry and ice-cream. Mmmmmm!

3.0,1/27/2013,"Originally from Korea, would be honest to review this place more than anyone else.As if Shun Lee West is a higher level of places in Chinatown, Bann is a higher level of those in Korea town. Service, interior, and ambience are all immecable. Not crazy busy and crowded like small, packed places in K-town; interior is very luxurious; and service is also great. But I would say food itself is not far better than K-town. Not 100% authentic taste, a bit americanized korean food (for example, sauce for Bo Ssam was like a mixture of little bit mayo and korean traditional bean paste). If you are looking for really authentic food, check out Danji (the only Michelin-starred korean restaurant in Manhattan) which is just two blocks away from Bann. At Bann, would recommend their noodles/rice/traditional entrees rather than barbeque grill menus. Bo Ssam(roast pork belly with lettuce wrap) or Kal Bi Jim(tender beef short ribs) for meat lovers. Jap Chae(stir fried glass noodles with vegetables) would be good for vegetarians.Dessert is also good (even though they are not related to korean traditionall food at all).

The Bul Go Gi was pretty good, the meat was well marinated and cooked pretty quickly.  Personally I've had better and worse Bul Go Gi, so it wasn't anything to rave about. The mochi green tea ice cream was a pretty good dessert to end the dinner experience.as for service, our server did an excellent job and was on top of everything, whether it was refilling the water, removing the finished dishes, noticing when our wine/alcohol was almost done and following up on that.  I don't recall at any moment that our server skipped a beat with his service.as far as price, has it not been restaurant week, i can imagine the bill be a little pricey.as for atmosphere, the restaurant's atmosphere was definitely just right for a romantic date.",0,0,0,Andy K.,"FOREST HILLS, NY",96,8,0

My buddy and I shared a Medium BBQ platter which had Shrimp, Rib Eye, Salmon and Short Rib.  All of the meat game pre-marinated.  The Short Rib was ridiculous.  So, so good.  What every marinade they use should be sold to cure cancer.  Keep it on the grill for 1.5 to 2 minutes on each side for medium/medium rare.  We also threw the short ribs in a lettuce wrap and ate it that way.  Out of sight.  The Salmon and Rib Eye were also really good.  Shrimp was passable.We were rushed so we didn't stay for dessert but it was a great place.",0,0,0,Chris S.,"Orlando, FL",91,291,16

1.0,1/16/2013,"I went to Bann twice (both times with a coupon of some sort --but this has no impact on the review) and both times, they were misses. The second time I bought a livingsocial for this place but I didn't even know I had been here before. If I knew, I wouldn't have bought it at all!I mean the place is big and decorated to reflect upscale Korean food HOWEVER, their food is mediocre, no where near upscale. If you think this place is good, you obviously have not tried Korean food in K-Town or Flushing. Their food is definitely not worth the price. I would not come here to eat even with a coupon again. Lesson learned. Now I have memorized this restaurant name to insure I won't make the same mistake again. They don't even offer Korean BBQ plates already prepared unless it's the weekend. If you wanted something like Bulgogi or Kalbi, it would have to be cooked in front of you. I didn't want it that day because I didn't want to get soaked up in Korean BBQ smell. Plus the waiter was like ""we only offer that during the weekends"" and I was like ""Okay....but it's Friday, it's not a weekend."" Understandable some people consider Friday a weekend but that is not entirely adopted by everyone so don't talk like I was supposed to know that this restaurant considered Friday a weekend. Food is also in small portions too. Save your money and eat some real Korean food.",0,0,0,Adelyn L.,"New York, NY",23,89,11

Big, modern space. I especially like their cod/daegu jorim and their Kalbi. Generous portions and refills of the complimentary salad. I think if you're looking for Korean food for people who aren't familiar with it or Korean food to impress a date, this might be a good place. I definitely think they do tone down the flavors (garlic, spice), but if you wanted the full authentic Korean flavors, best to go to Koreatown or even better Fort Lee or Queens.",0,0,0,Baek D.,"Brooklyn, NY",1,23,0

4.0,1/6/2013,"Great date spot that serves Americanized version of Korean Food. The place is a bit isolated from the craziness of Times Square which is good since I HATE crowds especially the hordes of clueless tourists thinking they're getting the ""New York"" experience by walking and dining in boring and ubiquitous chain restaurants near Times Square. I've actually been to this restaurant about 4 years ago but I didn't ""YELP"" during that time and I cannot recall what I ate. One of the roommates wanted to dine here since it's where many celebrities (both Korean and Foreign) have dined and lately KPOP World sensation PSY ate here too. As soon as we entered the restaurant, we were greeted by a Hispanic host/server/worker in Korean!! lol He even asked how many people in Korean which was funny since the only time I've seen Hispanic workers greet me in fluent Korean in a Korean restaurant  were Korean restaurants in LA California LMAO. Anyways, back to reviewing:The place itself has an elegant vibe with dark lights and with visible Asian decors all around the restaurant. Our waiter served us water as soon as we sat down, and promptly took our orders. He wasn't over the top friendly but that's kind of expected in a Korean restaurant in New York.  Anyways, we ordered 2 servings of Galbi for the BBQ, a Spicy Pork and Kimchi Dish as our entree to share, and ordered two appetizers of Bann Garibi or Scallops and Broiled Eel. The BBQ comes with a trio of side dishes serving basic Korean pickles and kimchi and served with a bed of lettuce, carrots, cucumbers, chili pepper, and Korean BBQ sauce Ssamjang. The Galbi was alright, nothing outstanding and the portions were a bit too small. The Broiled Eel (2 pieces) were marinated in sweet Soy sauce and served over sizzling stones which was appealing to the eyes. They were good but it wasn't anything outstanding.The Ban Garibi or Scallops (3 pieces) were memorable. These minced Sea Scallops with Korean Pine Mushroom were baked in a Light Shrimp Mousse which resulted in a creamy, soft, and delicious item.Spicy Pork with Kimchi dish was pretty good actually. It was  loaded with A LOT of meat,  topped with slices of Tofu, and  as an avid meat-eater, I was glad to see less Kimchi and more pork in that dish which is definitely a plusFor dessert, we got the following:Pineapple Sorbet= Roomie who got this regretted it as it wasn't anything special. Just three scoops of same ice creamSoju Banana Sabayon: Silky Soju & Banana Infused Whipped Custard with Mixed Berries & Sweet Sesame Dipplies Tuiles. Creative but the banana flavor was wayy too overpowering. Tropical Snow Dessert: DO GET THIS!!! Sooo yummy!!! Wow, just wow!!! YUM and so worth every $!!! It's a combination of coconut ice cream topped with shaved coconut milk, ice, jellied fruit, sweet beans & Vanilla Anglaise.Despite being a Korean restaurant, 90% of the customers were non-Korean. So if you're a non-Korean and new to the whole Korean cuisine thing, I suggest you try Bann before heading to K-town on 32nd Street to try the real deal. As a genuine Korean, I doubt I'll eat here again but will definitely come for drinks and dessert, especially the TROPICAL SNOW!!!! +_+",6,1,3,Old Fart M.,"Manhattan, NY",0,1148,11072
3.0,1/4/2013,"When it comes to Bann, it all depends on your point of view.  The main reason I eat here is  that it's ridiculously close to me, only a block away, where Korea Town (by far my favorite) is further away.  The food is what I would call ""good for American taste,"" in other words, not quite as good and not as spicy and flavorful as what you'd typically find in K-Town.  I found the tabletop Kalbi good, the Jap Chae too, the Kimchee Jige was quite serviceable, and the raw beef, excellent.  However,  I'd pass on the Bool Kogi (zero flavor), the Crab and Leek appetizer, the Gooksu, and the Mandoo appetizer.  You have to be particular here.  While the all-Mexican crew is quite adept at food prep, alas, they ain't Korean.  But if you stick to the tried and true, you'll be content.  Btw, the cocktails were good and the desserts surprisingly excellent--desserts normally never found in a Korean restaurant, and again, clearly a nod toward the more Western palette.",1,0,1,Robert K.,"New York, NY",11,85,88

The space was as elegantly decorated as I remembered. Service was also as friendly: I arrived 15 min before my reservation and the server had no problem with granting my request to get in early.

When she told me Korean was an option for RW I was surprised & a little nervous. However a new life resolution of mine is to try foods that I would not normally eat. I want to start this review of by saying I mean NO DISRESPECT TO THE KOREAN CULTURE OR ANY KOREAN PERSON with my review! When I first looked at the menu I said Oh Fuck There is NOTHING for me to eat here..  I seriously thought that I would have to get dinner after we ate here from lack of options for me. After reviewing the menu a ton more times I realized that I would just have to champ it out & try something. By process of elimination I had to go with the  Bo Ssam Bun : which was pork belly on a bun. I didn't know pork belly literally meant pork fat or BLUBBER on a bun as I renamed the dish. But seriously who feeds people just slabs of fat on a piece of bread & then puts spicy sauce on it! I'm sorry but that is just disgusting! For my entree I had Bann Gooksu which consisted of egg noodles and vegetables with a sesame sauce. The noodles were fine but there were way too many vegetables in it that wouldn't eat. i picked at it  & just ate the noodles & chicken, removing all the items I refuse to eat. For dessert I picked chocolate ice cream. Presentation was nice as it was served on a block of ice. I left out Ally's meals because I don't want to offend anyone else with my opinions on her wings.Service to be honest was sub par. The waiter was ridiculously quiet & distant. He didn't discuss the menu items with us especially when we made it obvious that we were way out of comfort zone. Water refills shouldn't take as long as they did, & we shouldn't have been treated differently then other customers in his section. We didn't get lessons on how to use chop sticks like other tables. Our waiter would creepily lurk over the table, not say anything & then just walk away. We didn't get asked if we like out meal, if everything was ok.

3.0,8/12/2012,"After a fantastic experience at Club A steakhouse during restaurant week, I was eager to try out another restaurant for some savory food that wouldn't break the bank. My Korean friend, who's staying in the US for a few months, was eager for me to eat authentic Korean food with her. It would be my second visit to a Korean restaurant, and I happily agreed. She picked Bann, which was also participating in restaurant week. Little did she know that the entree and dessert I would order would be the least authentically Korean dishes on the menu, to my disappointment- even though I enjoyed both of them.Me and her, and another friend were promptly seated and given the restaurant week menus. My friend was shocked to see that Bi Bim Bap, which is what she wanted me to try the most since it was a Korean staple, was offered during lunch but not dinner- why not? We may never know. I ordered Dak Nal Ke Ti Kim, which is spicy honey chili glazed crispy chicken wings, and even though it wasn't crispy at all, it was spicy and mouthwatering-ly sweet, a delicious combination. My friend tried one wing, and told me it tasted just like wings in Korea. So the appetizer was American-tested, Korean-approved, a good sign!Unfortunately, that was the only dish I ordered that resembled authentic Korean food. My entree was Korean barbecue: the Kal Bi (beef short rib), served on a hot plate with onions. As I tried it with rice and kimchee, it tasted... like a good dish, but a dish my mom or I could have made at home, and there was not enough sauce, either. Huh? My friend tried it, and confirmed my suspicion: she said it tasted nothing like Kalbi in Korea... and it shouldn't be off the bone. Oh well. However, I tasted her Un Dae Gu Jo Rim, which is black cod, and it was pretty good- she added that it tasted just like her mother's cooking. I also tried my other friend's spicy pork ribs, and oh-my-goodness it was so, so good- an amazing blend of spiciness and sweetness. Guess it was all about the luck of the draw, and I wasn't so lucky.For dessert, I ordered Soju Banana Sabayon, which was custard with berries, and it tasted like... ordinary custard. My friend tried it also, and actually called the waiter over to ask him why it was named Soju Banana Sabayon, since she couldn't taste any soju in it. The waiter explained that only a little soju was added to the custard, hence the misleading name.Yes, the food was good, and yes, the service was good as well,  but it shouldn't be about the luck of the draw, as I mentioned before. Every dish should be as close to authentic Korean food as possible, and not Americanized in any way. News flash: there are actually many Americans who love authentic exotic food, with all its spices and strong flavors, including me, which is what I expected at Bann.

3.0,8/11/2012,"I'm always in search of good Korean food, so I was really looking forward to eating at Bann with a friend for Restaurant Week.  We picked Bann based on its posted RW menu.  It didn't quite live up to my expectations, but it wasn't terrible either.For appetizers, we ordered the Bo Ssam Bun (roast pork belly and spicy pickled daikon with soy reduction on steamed flour buns)  and Cham Chi Hwe (ahi tuna sashimi over sliced Asian pear).  Neither was very impressive.  I found the buns to be kind of cold and the pork belly to resemble really fatty, flavorless bacon.  The entrees were much better - the Kalbi Jim (short rib and kabocha brasied in sake soy glaze) was really flavorful and tender.  My friend enjoyed her sauteed egg noodles, vegetables and chicken - her portion was so huge she had plenty for lunch the next day.Dessert was unmemorable.  The cocktail I had was delicious, though - the Asian Glow (ha!) which was soju, white peach, St. Germain, and lemon.  Really refreshing and yummy.Service lagged a little, but I give the hostess credit for being really patient - my friend was running almost half an hour late, and there was no problem seating us once she arrived.If you're in the neighborhood, check it out - but if you're looking for really delicious Korean food, head down to TriBeCa and hit up Kori.",1,0,0,Krista G.,"Hoboken, NJ",64,64,0

5.0,7/26/2012,"When my boyfriend moved to Hells Kitchen I did an extensive search of restaurants in the area. We love Korean BBQ in K-town, so when we stumbled upon Bann it was like a match made in heaven. ""High class"" Korean BBQ at it's finest. Some people might prefer the more authentic qualities to the restaurants in K-town, but Bann has quickly become my favorite Korean BBQ joint. We always start off with the Jap Chae, which are stir fried glass noodles with assorted vegetables and beef, and a new favorite pointed out to me by my foodie best friend, Duk Bok Gi, which are rice cakes sauteed in spicy red chili sauce with beef. If you like gnocchi you will love Duk Bok Gi because it has the same chewy consistency.The pork buns and most of the rice dishes are great as well for an appetizer/side dish. Although the pork buns don't really compare to say Momofuku, if you're craving those pillowy buns and the succulent pork, it will certainly satiate you. For our korean bbq aspect we usually do Kal bi (short rib) and Bul Go Gi (rib eye), although recently we've been doing their small special which comes with both Kal Bi and Bul Go Gi, plus shrimp. With the meats they give you traditional Korean BBQ sides like kimchi, etc. Plus a really yummy side salad with a sesame like dressing that I can never get enough of. Overall, I cannot say enough about the amazingly tasty dishes at Bann. If you've never done Korean BBQ I suggest you get yourself over to Bann ASAP, and if you have, I promise you won't be let down.",1,0,1,Rebeka R.,"Manhattan, NY",10,7,4
5.0,7/25/2012,"Bann has to be one of my absolute favorite restaurants in NYC. Every dish is just exploding with flavor. Every time I leave I am more full than I ever get on Thanksgiving and every other big eating holiday combined.Dishes that are a must try at Bann:Duk Bok Gi (rice cake sauteed in spicy red chili sauce with beef): I can never get enough of Duk Bok Gi. Whenever I go to Bann, I always order this while switching out the other appetizer that is ordered.The real winner at Bann though is doing the boneless beef short rib Korean bbq style. This comes with lettuce so you can make this into a heavenly lettuce wrap. Comes with a sort of ginger sauce and garlic oil that you pour all over. Absolutely fabulous. I can go on all night about how much I love this dish. My mouth is watering just thinking about it.Of course every other dish I have tried there is nothing short of amazing as well.

We both had the BBQ (Bul Go Gi & Kal Bi). A ton of meat, unlimited kimchi, carrots, cucumber, lettuce, etc.. for salads and toppings. Only annoying thing (very small detail) was they gave us a small amount of kimchi and others to start, but you can always ask for more and it's free. Desserts were an afterthought, the chocolate cake was the best. But it didn't matter, as the BBQ was huge and very filling.

3.0,7/24/2012,"Came here for restaurant week. Over all, the place is okay--it meets standards but it's not a place you'll remember. The food is good, but not outstanding. Service was okay but not mind blowing. For the appetizer, I had the Se Kal Mari, which was good starter. Just be aware that it's a very small portion (like four pieces) so it's good if you're not super hungry, but if you are, then I suggest getting the Chicken Wings (which are much bigger). For the entree, I got the Black Cod, which was prepared really well, but a little too salty and heavy on the Soy Sauce. But the whole thing comes with Rice, so it seemed  to balance everything out.Honestly, the best thing from the whole dinner was the dessert. The Pear Crumble was really good and not too sweet, which often is the case. Service was okay, but could be better. It took forever for a water refill and our plates were not served at the same time so it was kind of awkward--but eh, kind of prepared myself for that since I read that that was the norm at Bann.",1,1,1,Shireen L.,"Manhattan, NY",267,64,0
4.0,7/22/2012,"Came here for the first day of Restaurant Week and it was pretty damn worth it! Right off the bat, for $35 a person, you get a pretty damn good amount of food for what you're paying.For starters, we had the Bo Ssam Bun (roasted pork belly), and the Cham Che Hwe (ahi tuna sashimi). The pork buns were pretty tasty, but just a tad on the tiny side. Taste-wise, it couldn't dethrone Ippudo's pork buns, but it was very good to say the least. The ahi tuna sashimi has a nice sweet/spicy complement to it. The asian pear, combined with chili gave it a nice tangy sort of taste to it. Out of those two, if I had to pick one, I'd probably go with the Bo Ssam Bun just for the sake of quantity.Now the entree is where this restaurant week menu shines. Now there are tons of choices such as: cod, cold noodles, short rib and more, but what you want is the Korean BBQ. Go straight for the kalbi because that's where the money is at. It's a great cut of meat and tastes amazing. I was actually a little surprised at how much kalbi they gave us, considering we were here for restaurant week. In each of our portions, we probably had a good 12-15 pieces of kalbi inside. Combine that with a bowl of rice, and you'll be content after dinner. The kalbi itself wasn't too sweet nor salty. Toss on some garlic, miso paste, and wrap that buddy in some lettuce to have that true winning combination.For dessert, you had the choice between: ice cream, chocolate cake, and an asian pear crumble. The chocolate cake was not overly sweet. It reminded me of the chocolate soufflé at Roy's. On the side, there was a small scoop of vanilla ice cream to help balance out the chocolaty taste. The asian pear crumble is probably the best out of the three desserts. It's a little unique in the sense that you can get chocolate cake and ice cream anywhere, so why not give it a try.I must say the service here was pretty good. We were asked multiple times if we needed anything and if the service was up to par. Great attentiveness, cozy seating, and best of all, it's a 1 minute walk from my apartment. Bann is a good lingering feeling of what Woo Lae Oak used to be. I just now need to find the time to come back here.",5,1,1,Michael W.,"New York, NY",747,1029,240

Came here for restaurant week (7/18/2012) and I have to say, when I get rich I'm coming back here lol....I started with the Dak Nal Ke Ti Kim (chicken wings), and these were great! They came with a dipping sauce, which was ok but I didn't use it much because I wanted to taste the juicy saucy-ness of the wings. They only gave 4, and I wished I had more but it was enough considering I still had the main course and dessert coming up. My foodie partner had the Ke Sal Mari (crab) and these were tiny pieces of orgasms...seriously...but they were such a tease!I moved on to the Un Dae Gu Jo Rim (black cod) and OMG, talk about melting in your mouth! It was huge and I kid you not, I could've tipped the plate in my mouth and swallowed the whole thing in one big gulp. It was incredibly soft and the sauce was slightly sweet, yet complimentary in the best way possible. My foodie, since we wanted different dishes, had the Kal Bi Jim (beef short rib) and just like mine...SOFT!!! I love when my meat is soft and Bann did an excellent job appealing to my tastes without me even asking!For dessert we both had the Asian Pear Crumble, which was a square-shaped pear crumble (think of apple crumble, but with pears lol) and a scoop of ice cream, though I'm not sure what flavour. They went well together since the crumble was hot.They also have traditional Korean BBQ, and each table is equipped with its own ""grill"", and one of these blessed days I shall try this out.

4.0,6/4/2012,"I've gone to Bann twice so far and both times were delicious. I've tried Kalbijim, twice :), Yook Hwe Bibimbap, and Undaegu Jorim (Black Cod). They're Kalbijim was the most tender, best tasting Kalbijim I've ever had in my whole life! (And I've had A LOT of Kalbijim mind you.) For those who aren't familiar, Kalbijim is like the filet mignon of korean bbq. It's scrumptious and the portion is great for the price. Let's say it's about the size of ordering 3 filet mignons. Throwing caution to the wind, It's a bit salty but I don't mind, bc I mix it with rice and ask for extra salad.The Black Cod was tasty, but it had the same flavor that my grandma makes, which means it's awesome bc she's a wonderful cook. The fish was incredibly tender and there's a slightly spicy, traditional sauce that goes on top. I wouldn't order it again bc I can get the equivalent at home but for those who can't, it's a great choice.The Yook Hwe Bibimbap is something that I would have never ordered on my own. It's traditional mixed rice with raw beef. I've had horrible experiences with raw meat in the past and wouldn't normally take the chance but my bf loves it so I taste-tested. I admit, it was delicious. Unbeknownst to me, my chopsticks kept on dipping into his dish time and time again throughout the meal.

4.0,5/29/2012,"Bann is Korean with a dark, modern asian flair, high ceilings and clean sight lines. It is basically well plated Koren food, with some fusion ideas thrown in there for show. For the lushes, theare are lots of nooks and crannies to enjoy a drink with a secret somebody. And to top it off, it has fantastic ventilation and doesn't smell like BBQ, although many tables enjoy it. The ambiance definitely up this review up from a 3.5 to a 4 star review. Jon F. and I ordered:bann ri mi (minced sea scallop & korean pine mushroom baked in a light shrimp mousse)kalbi BBQ for the table (pork)soon dou bou (tofu stew)The appetizer bann ri mi made a dramatic entrace to the table - it was literally on fire, flickering and steaming! It was served in the scallop shells and was creamy, salty, and fresh. The three bites we had were really really delicious and worth every cent. The Kalbi was tasty and a really great quality cut of meat. The portion was good, but may be on the small side if you're used to eating at the Ktown super BBQ houses like Shilla. The soon dou bou, which is a classic, homestyle, and basic dish, was just okay. Compared to the other dishes, it was bland and uninteresting, and failed to impress. Part of it is the nature of the dish, the lower price point, but part of me wanted to see how they would interpret tofu stew into a more modern meal. According to Jon, the cocktail was also yummy. Service was good, but can be spotty when your waiter is juggling too much. The meal was very leisurely, but I know that may turn some theatergoers off. The bar is also a bit more narrow than the restaurant seating. For maximum comfort and enjoyment, get a table in a side room.",2,0,1,Suanne L.,"Brooklyn, NY",198,979,842

My roommate and I went and got Kimchi Chigae and Eun Dae Gu Jo Rim. Because this place alters the ingredients and flavors to be more favorable to a lot of people, it is slightly sweeter than traditional Korean cuisine.

The Eun Dae Gu, however, was most definitely the highlight. This was my favorite dish at Woo Lae Oak, and it remains the same at Bann.

2.0,1/18/2012,"I had dinner here recently and given that I've been to many Korean restaurants in Koreatown, and throughout the city - this one was in my opinion - is a miss. Perhaps the idea was to slightly upscale the dining experience, but it was definitely not up to par. The decor was nice - mood lighting, cool chill music at the bar/lounge area, the staff was friendly, but I found myself searching for the waiter too many times. The chef is very heavy handed with the salt/soy in the kitchen items, the roast pork belly w/spicy daikon (pickled) served in man tao (steamed flour buns)  was way too salty, the flavor was apparent, but the overkill on sodium destroyed it for me.  (In my experience with the majority of Asian pickled anything - it needs to be soaked in water before cooking and consumption - just like bacalao). I literally felt my blood pressure rising after the second bite, then finally, I removed the pickled daikon - it was better, but still salty for ""my"" taste, because on top of the pickled daikon being too salty the sauce was also salty to begin with. My main dish, the short ribs w/kambocha squash was not what I expected. The meat was tender, well seasoned, slices of short rib, off the bone, swimming in a medium thick broth reduction of soy and sugar with the squash stewed in it ... yes too salty again. Honestly, if they served the short rib with the bone on a puree of kambocha squash and reduced the sodium to half - it would have been an excellent dish. Had a taste of the hot chocolate cake, and it was very good -  not overly sweet.  My friends had the bbq short rib (cooked at the table) and it was actually good, but I have had way better, truly authentic bbq in Koreatown, of course with less ambience and service - but I would take better food over service anyday in this case. Conclusion - would I ever return? No. Would I recommend it - sure, but try at your own risk.",1,0,0,M. K.,"New York, NY",0,2,0
3.0,1/18/2012,"Meh.  I hesitate giving this three stars. This is a Korean-Americanized as fuck restaurant for people who've never been to a Korean restaurant where none of the staff speak English and/or don't speak English well.  That being said, it's fine for what it is, which from my assumption is to invite people not familiar with Korean cuisine into the delicious arena of barbecue and kimchi.  So fine, I support that enough.  Our cuisine is amazing and under-appreciated.I thought the decor was tacky as hell (a gigantic buddha?), the waiter asked if I wanted my Tanqueray and tonic with ""a twist"" and ""on the rocks"" thus maintaining my belief that Korean restaurants don't know how to do mixed drinks at all and you should stick to beer and sochu, and there were less than a handful of Korean speaking peeps up in there.My friend and I went for restaurant week, and she had never been to a Korean restaurant, and I rarely ever go without the aid of a Korean speaking family member, so I thought this would be a good opportunity.  And it's fine, but for real, find a fucking translator and go to Flushing, or if you can't bear to leave Manhattan, go to Koreatown if you want something more.  But I mean, for a first shot/an introduction, fine, settle with Bann.  Because that's what you're doing.We ordered the bo ssam bun, chicken wings and the bulgogi and kalbi.  Straight up, you get NO banchan.  We got both appetizers first and didn't get the banchan until the BBQ.  What?!?!  And you get very limited banchan - broccoli, kimchi and something else.  Bitch, please.  Give me that banchan or else.  Our table should have been FULL with them shits.I've also never seen a grill so low into the table, and again, the decor was tacky so the lighting was so ""romantic"" that I could barely see where we were grilling.   To the other reviewer who said the grill was too low to use his/her ""chopstix,"" it's because you don't know how to use chopsticks, son.So, 3/5 because it does what it should.  It's A-OK and that's all it is.",2,7,0,Jennifer L.,"Albuquerque, NM",82,369,402

3.0,11/10/2011,"Enjoyed our meal here and would happily eat here again if I need to be in the neighborhood, though I would not make a special trip to go back. The service was attentive and patient, especially as we were novices about Korean food. One caveat is to carefully consider the size of your group before choosing this restaurant (more below). The meal was priced reasonably for midtown Manhattan, but seemed a bit expensive for family-style Asian food, especially when you consider that we did much of the work of cooking (as one of our party pointed out). The mid-week noise level was very reasonable, especially after the pre-theater crowd left. I will leave the cuisine comments to others who have more experience with Korean fare. The food was not very spicy, but suited us fine. I suspect as others have commented that it might disappoint aficionados, but we enjoyed our dishes and the experience. My only nitpick would be that we ran out of lettuce leaves to wrap our barbecue and no more were offered. There was one bowl of rice and one of leaves for 5 people. The desserts were good, as others have commented.The one thing I did not see mentioned before is that the table arrangement can make seating a group of 5 (our size) awkward. Since the restaurant wasn't full at 8pm on a Weds, the hostess was kind enough to offer the choice of sharing 2 tables for 4 that were side-by-side, or having one person perch on the end of a 4 (which we did). The two-table choice seemed awkward for sharing food and cooking together, but putting 5 at a table for 4 was too cozy and crowded. The service staff tried hard to clear dishes and make the situation as good as possible, but I would not recommend this set-up. 2-4 people would work fine, and more than 6 could be happy at the side-by-side tables, but 5 was awkward (no fault of the restaurant).

2.0,10/2/2011,"Offering ""innovative Korean cuisine"" and falling into the trendy category, I confronted our dinner at Bann with an open mind and having as reference my previous experience at Woo Lae Oak, their sister restaurant and first opened, but closed now, that presented an interesting interpretation of traditional Korean cuisine in a beautiful space. Although it wasn't completely satisfying, there was a few highlights back then and potential in their food. At Bann however, seems like everything goes by the look, exclusively. The place itself is pretty but the concept is boring in a city like NY. Still, is something to enjoy. The style is very modern and we can apply the usual description. Dark, dim light, dark wood and predictable Asian theme ornaments. I wouldn't say it's intimate since the space is big and it doesn't really evoke any cozy or warm feeling. But you can find it to be a nice atmosphere. Perhaps, you could even impress someone if the intention is just to do it by the surface. Memorable? ... nothing really but, the Eel in sweet soy marinade over sizzling stones was above average. The meat was tender and flavorful, although a little bit sweet which happens usually with this dish not only at Bann The fish pieces were presented over two big round black stones that pleased our eyes. Beautiful and delicious; yes, it can be. Memorable ...  actually, thinking about it I'd say everything was, just because I found it not even close to what Korean food taste like, but also because of the unbalanced flavor profile. Duck breast with crispy daikon and greens in a Korean miso presented as a wrapped roll was completely tasteless and the wrapping thick and chewy. Difficult to forget indeed. My friends got really excited ordering a Conch spicy salad (Gol Bang Ie) which is sliced conch, pickle daikon and cucumber in chili sauce. Discordantly bitter and spicy, the spiciness was tolerable even for ""weak"" palates, but I kept thinking the spices can't be right. A little bit better was the Braised spicy chicken casserole with carrot and potato. The chicken and vegetables were well cook and tender. But once again the broth failed in being more flavorful and with the right mix of spices and also not as thick as is suppose to be. There was some banchan dishes, that included pickles and kimchee. The Kimchee wasn't right either. It lacked spiciness and enough fermentation time to produce the typical product. The desserts were stunning somehow. The look will impress you. I personally didn't find it too fine but excessive, not my style. Kids will feel extremely pleased by this. The O Mi Cha Dragon, a Chinese dragon avatar, is a puff pastry with layers of berry mouse and fresh slices strawberries. It was enough good. More impressive was the Tropical Snow. A ball of coconut ice cream topped and surrounded by shaved coconut milk ice, sweet beans and vanilla anglase. The recipient were is based is a huge ice bowl. Fascinating. Practical? not really when it starts to melt. But it was also enough good. I actually enjoyed the desserts even when I found it too sweetB-esides A-stethics N-othing else to N-ominate at Bann, but if you still wanna give a try keep it simple: barbecue.

2.0,8/25/2011,"Meh. I really have experienced better. The food was a smidgen better than I was expecting, considering how unimpressed I was with the actual restaurant. There are two entrances, which is a bit confusing, and though I came in through the ""main"" one, it took about 10 minutes of awkwardly standing around before the bartender went to find the hostess. She finally arrived and led my party of 2 to the back of the restaurant. The place is quite large! Unfortunately, the size and acoustics of the place gave it a cafeteria on a wet day feel. Something about the acoustics amplified every conversation, clink of silverware, and screams of children running around the place unchaperoned. A distracted waitress arrived to drop off menus about 5 minutes after we were seated. No greeting, no nothing. We were parched for water but didn't get any for about 15 minutes after being seated (and we had to flag someone down to ask for it). The waitress remained MIA at our table, though she was SUPER friendly to the Korean-speaking family sitting less than a foot away from us at a pretty much adjoining table (strange layout), which made it kind of awkward.  She must have forgotten about us because when she finally made eye contact with us, she hurriedly shuffled over to take our order. After that, we didn't see much of her. We must have had 3 or 4 different people come to drop off food, take away plates, but we never really saw her until the end-half of our meal, when she would come by and not speak, but only move the same entree plate a few inches here or there while we were mid-meal. She must have done it 3 times -- odd??  The food itself was ok.  The seafood pancake is a little thicker than traditionally normal, but it was crispy and satisfying. The kalbi was marinated well and was surprisingly tender. We also got the marinated cod and daikon radish which was not very good. I usually love this dish (how my mom makes it), but the fish was mush. I'm not sure if it's because the cod might have been frozen, but it had absolutely no texture and almost had the consistency of mashed potatoes. A real shame because the stewed broth had good flavor.All-in-all, I can't believe people would pay so much for a subpar Korean meal experience.  While I get that the ""ambiance"" is a big pull, considering that most of the better Korean places in K-town don't exactly cater to non-Koreans or have much to contribute to a date experience if you're looking for romance, I just didn't get Bann.  Thank goodness I had an OpenTable Spotlight coupon - otherwise I would have been pissed.  The bill, which we had to ask for after 10 minutes of waiting at an empty table, was for 2 entrees and an appetizer (no drinks) and came out to $88 (after the coupon, was $38).  Too bad the waitress decided to take it upon herself to include 18% gratuity (for a party of 2).  I get it (I've been a server before as well), she might have thought that with the coupon, we would have tipped on the after-discount amount... Too bad for her that my tipping default is at least 20%... but that assumption in itself was enough for me to just sign the damn thing and get out without adding anything on top of what she calculated.  Conclusion:  Food was ok, not really worth the $$.  Ambiance:  Way too dark, not really ""romantic"" with how loud it gets inside and all the toddlers running around unsupervised.  Service:  LACKING.",1,0,0,Alexa H.,"New York, NY",0,16,0

1.0,4/11/2011,"Terrible. Just terrible. I'm certainly not picky when it comes to Korean, but I've had much better for less. First, the atmosphere feels like I should be asking for bottle service, not dinner. Thumping techno, gaudy leather seats, it all kind of made me laugh. I let it slide because I had peeked at the menu and was actually excited. For appetizers we ordered Duk Bok Gi, Pa Jun, Dae Ji, and Beef Mandu (it was a large group). All four were somewhat bland and hardly memorable. The dumplings were probably the freshest tasting thing they had to offer. Then came the main attraction: Korean BBQ! If you've never had it, traditional Korean BBQ comes with raw meat that you cook to your desired tenderness on a propane grill that is built into your table. It's usually  pork, beef or chicken.  Along with your meat you are usually given several small side dishes of pickled vegetables (always some kimchi!), noodles, rice, etc. The selection will vary from restaurant to restaurant. We decided to order the largest platter, which included duck, beef, pork, salmon, and shrimp. The meat arrived and the grill was  turned on. to my surprise, when they took the top off the grill, it was much smaller than I guessed it would be, and deeper too. This proved to be a problem when four people were simultaneously trying to use it! The next issue was how they cut up  the meat. Generally, when I have ordered any kind of Korean BBQ, the meat is usually thin cut and somewhat fatty, so it cooks quickly and stays moist. Besides looking terribly unappetizing (the duck looked like turkey giblets), the cuts were so thick that they outside of the meat would dry out before the inside was cooked. The first piece of filet minon (I think that is what it was) I bit into was raw inside.  The small size of the grill did not help this, as you tried cooking the meat as quickly as possible so others could use it. The meat itself was not particularly flavorful either, and I got the sense that they were using cheaper cuts at this place. The worst part was the side dishes, or lack thereof. With our platter we were given a small plate with small piles of kimchi, cucumber, and pickled radish. For four people it was not enough. We had to ask for more at one point. With dinner I ordered a glass of white wine, and was given a sickly sweet glass of pinot that cost $11. I'll bet the bottle cost less than $10. When all was said and done, we skipped dessert  and asked for the bill. $336 for 4 people, not including gratuity. Not unexpected, but it hurt to pay that much for such a sub-par meal.So, let's review: terrible atmosphere, overpriced liquor, food that I could improve on in my own kitchen, awkward BBQ set up, lacking in side dishes, almost $100 per person.

A more trendy and less authentic taste and feel to it.First thing you might notice is there aren't a whole lot of Korean people eating here. It seemed like more a romantic date spot and less of a room full of grilled meats wafting in the air.Our waiter was very nice, but he did allow the kitchen to bring out apps and mains out at the same time. A bit of a pet peeve of mine. But not the end of the world.I would call this place exactly what it is...a Korean restaurant for out of K-Towners. A good first attempt of Korean without being to disconnected.The happy hour lychee martini's were really good.

3.0,2/1/2011,"All in all, Bann is a great Korean cultural ambassador.  I enjoy going there to see non-Koreans enjoying Korean bbq in a nice, dressy, upscale setting.  However, that means the flavors are catered towards more ""American"" taste.  Things are not as spicy as they should be, and instead taste much more sweeter than ""normal"" Korean food. Besides the food, the place is way too freaking dark to grill my meat!! We were literally hovering over the grill, squinting in frustration, to figure out if our meat was done.  I know that the dark, romantic lighting goes with the whole decor, but I JUST WANNA GRILL. Also, Bann is way too skimpy on the banchan (side dishes)...which is my biggest problem with this place.  In Korean restaurants, the patron expects the banchan to be refilled automatically throughout the meal, and this also doesn't happen at Bann.  When I go to Bann, I feel like that annoying customer who is constantly nagging at the waiter...but wait, that is all part of the Korean eating experience!!!That is why I only go to Bann when I am too lazy to go all the way to K town...I would rather eat authentic bbq in one of the smokey, loud, and chaotic gogi spots on 32nd st.",0,0,0,Jane S.,"Manhattan, NY",56,42,1
5.0,1/24/2011,"A modern Korean restaurant with trendy, upscale decor.  At first, I was skeptical of the quality of the food, as many times places like this emphasize style over substance.  The prices on the menu were also high, which increased my expectations, and thus my reservations about this place.  But, the Korean food here is AMAZING.The quality of the Korean food coming out of the kitchen here is better than what you would find in the restaurants in K-town.  Of course, there are high prices to match, but go on restaurant.com, buy a $25 gift certificate (use a promo code for 80% off) and spend it on here.Some highlights of the meal:1. Yook gye jang (spicy beef stew) - Normally, I do not like yook gye jang, as I have had it multiple times where it is bland, or too salty, or too spicy, or too watery.  But this is one of the best dishes on their menu, and one of the best yook gye jangs I have ever had.  The balance of the spice, the beef flavor, and the ingredients are perfect here.  The texture of the soup is smooth and delicious.  Not too spicy, not too salty, not watery, and not bland at all.  The beef is tender and well-cooked.  Captures the essence of a great yook gye jang.  Highly recommended.  2. Nak ji bokkeum (spicy braised octopus with noodles) - Skeptical at first, but the pieces of octopus here was cooked wonderfully and were juicy and flavorful.  High-quality seafood used here.  The noodles were of the right consistency and length, and the sauce used here from the braising of the octopus was bold and flavorful.The food was uniformly excellent.  In fact, afterwards, the gf and I ordered these two dishes again the next night.  Actions speak louder than words.  I can't wait to go back and try some of their other dishes sometime soon.",3,2,2,Albert S.,"Redondo Beach, CA",39,5,0

4.0,1/13/2011,"I am usually not a big Korean bbq fan, but I really enjoyed my meal at Bann.  Right next door to the Roundabout Theater and a bunch of other theaters, this is a great spot for pre-theater dining.  Yes Korean BBQ is ok for pre-theater dining with your fancy dress and suit because you will leave here smoke-free.  The high ceilings that allows for air to circulate and the smokeless charcoal grills inset into each marble table allows for a pleasant and fun dining experience.  The space is sleek and stylish.  Appropriate enough for a date.  The menu has a variety of options and would also be great for groups.We started off with the crab and leek crepes and the beef mandu.  Our waitress was very friendly and made good recommendations after we were quite indecisive. Unfortunately, the appetizers were served about 10-15 minutes apart. The crab and leek crepes were small but unique.  A nice start to the evening. The mandu were fine. I personally prefer Koreatown for it, but the mandu here were tasty and greaseless. For entrees, we decided to do the Korean bbq (although the stone pots of bibimbap passing by made me slighly envious).  The shrimp and beef were nicely spiced and accompanied by a salad with a sweet dressing.  We were also given lettuce, kimchee, some sauces, etc for us to make lettuce wraps or just to spice things up on our own.  Our waitress again was great and helped us start grilling, gave some suggestions on the best way to spice and eat our creations. She came over a couple of times to check up on us and to help us with our grilling.  Very good service. I really enjoyed the grilling experience. And I am a hard sell on these.  I always think..don't I go to a restaurant so that someone else cooks my food? But I thoroughly enjoyed my experience especially with the pre-seasoned meat.For dessert, we both got the Asian pear cobblers. These were pretty good, but would have been vastly improved if served warm.  I recommend Bann for a fun leisurely dinner with a trendy and stylish atmosphere.",2,1,1,Jasmine M.,"Manhattan, NY",160,364,0

4.0,12/19/2010,"So we went here tonight because I bought a coupon on ideeli for $60 which included a prix fixe menu for 2 and wine pairings. THE FOOD WAS  AMAZING. That being said, our waitress was not so great. Maybe she was't happy about the fact that we were using a coupon but once she took our order, she didn't come back for about 35 minutes. Also, I'm not sure exactly how the wine pairing was supposed to work BUT based on the way the menu looked, I should have gotten a glass with my appetizer and a glass with my entree. She said we only got one glass but fortunately my boyfriend doesn't like wine so he just gave me his. We ordered the Mandu and crab and leek crepes for apps, and the Bi Bim Bap and Kalbi BBQ for entrees. My bf has never had Korean BBQ before and he kept calling the Kal Bi ""outstanding"" which it was (esp. bc you can cook it to your liking). Since neither of us had ever cooked our own food at a korean restaurant before we just kind of stared blankly at our box of raw beef and flaming grill in the center of the table when the server brought it out. Fortunately, the manager (I think?) came over and asked us how we were doing and if our waitress had explained what to do (which she had not). He then proceeded to mix my Bi Bim Bap for me and cook 4 pieces of Kal Bi. He was incredibly congenial and we were very grateful that he helped us out in our waitress' absence. We ate till we were stuffed and then dessert arrived. It was amazing - boyfriend got the molten chocolate cake and i got the pear cobbler. Both were delicious. From start to finish, the whole thing took about 2 hours. We rolled out of there feeling fat and sassy and strolled over a few avenues to Rockefeller Center to look at the tree. Overall we had a good dinner. The food was great, some of the employees were very friendly and helpful, and the space was nicely decorated and rather romantic. Definitely a nice place to be on a chilly winter night. The bill arrived and we should have paid $126 for the food but bc of the prepaid coupon, we spent half of that amount.

2.0,11/8/2010,"Went here with family, pleasantly surprised by the decor and ambiance especially for what is essentially a Korean BBQ restaurant. The seating arrangement of the restaurant is not the most comfortable. We were seated in a corner and the booth-like seating for one side was squishy. The waitress was friendly except seemed young and not too experienced/knowledgeable. To be honest the people working there could have also doubled at any bar in K-town. We ordered haemul pajun, two jjigae, and the BBQ platter for 3-4 people. Pajun was good, but absolutely tiny. I understand that the more ""upscale"" a restaurant is usually the food proportions are going to be smaller than some family style restaurant, but still. It was the size of a kid's pan pizza. The jjigae's were pretty good, one of them had noodles that were overcooked. Be warned, the soup proportions are gigantic, not regular Korean style fare. Two for my family of four was way too much. The BBQ platter was decent as well. There was a good amount of kalbi, bulgogi, and tuna, but when it came to shrimp there were 4 measly pieces on the platter. It was filling enough for 4 though. All in all, the food is typical Korean BBQ restaurant food and your essentially paying to have it in a nicer restaurant setting. On a sidenote, my sister and I loved the fact that the grill had air vents built into it so that the smoky, grill smell wasn't absorbed into our clothes and hair. Instead of rising up, it went straight into the side vents inside the grill.

It is not too altered to fit the general public. Although it is not a Korean BBQ place with lots of side dishes and jjigaes, I thought the galbi and boolgogi here were very tender and delicious. They bring assortment of vegetables and rice in a small metal bowl.  They don't give it to you in abundance as the regular KBBQ places, but you can always ask for more.  The only downside is that there are practically no banchans at this restaurant. The only side dishes that came out was kimchee, kimchee radish, and broccoli. We ordered dolsot bibimbap (stone bibimbap). It was delicious. I thought it was cute how they ""carefully mix"" the stone bowl bibimbap for the customers and place a small portion on a plate.  Usually in most korean restaurants, we mix it ourselves and eat it from the bowl. The ddukbokgi- not so good.  They literally had no vegetables mixed with it. It was just dduk (rice cake) and the sauce. It was something I could've easily made it at home. For great ddukbokgi in Manhattan, go to boka or maru instead.Kimcheejjigae- I highly recommend it.  Surprisingly, it tasted just like the ones in regular korean restaurants. I thought they would alter the taste for westerners. Glad they kept the original taste. Overall, I think they did a great job in introducing Korean food to the public in a chic, fashionable manner.

3.0,9/9/2010,"You know, if I had to say one thing about the food at Bann, it would be 'subtle'.As complicated as the dish is that you ordered, and as many components as it might have, it just quietly sneaks up on you and envelops you subtly with its flavour. There's nothing that goes, 'Kaboom!', and there's definitely nothing wrong with that. I really enjoyed my stone bowl bibimbap that our server so nicely mixed for us. The accompaniments to the artisinal tofu were interesting too, but the tofu itself was bland and tasted like paper mache.This subtlety goes with the drinks too. My friend's asian glow drink was refreshing and my jalapeno daiquiri had a gentle heat to it. Very enjoyable. The desserts sounded mostly interesting but the one that we tried with the mung bean custard was quite meh.If I have to say one thing about the service at Bann, I probably wouldn't use the word subtle for it.

It came out to $30 (pre-delivery tip), which is pretty pricey for a soup and some rice noodles. Everything started off pretty well... the soup container had been wrapped in Saran so there was no chance of leakage. The dumplings were stored in a separate container from the soup.  The Jap Chae was stir-fried with fresh veggies and tasted pretty good in terms of texture and flavor (although it was a bit on the salty side). There was a small side salad with kimchi and pickled cabbage...Then... I open up the dumplings to put them into the soup... imagine my surprise when I realize that the skin of the dumplings was still uncooked... and basically stretched (not ripped) apart when I tried to separate them from each other. The dumpling skins were still white (and not the clear color of cooked skin for anyone who makes dumplings).  Not only is it inedible because it's not cooked correctly and the dumpling filling won't stay in its skin, but it was completely gross looking at the uncooked skin (about 50% of the skin of each dumpling was not cooked).Also, the soup was spicy even though there was no hint of that in the online description, which said ""Dumplings simmered in a savory light broth of daikon and pine mushrooms."" To be fair, it wasn't ""I need to dunk my face into a fountain of cold water"" spicy, but a warning in the description would have been nice.Still, $12 for an appetizer and $15 for a soup is a bit steep, even here in Midtown...",4,1,3,Nicole L.,"Philadelphia, PA",263,513,33

The one thing we got that we hadn't had before was the orimari (duck wrap). The pajun was good. Served on a hot stone plate, it had a nice crispy outside, lots of green onion and good amount of shrimp and squid. It was thicker than usual and also smaller diameter.We were not fans of the mandu. Filling was bit bland and the sauce reminded me too much of the thick breakfast soymilk you eat with chinese donuts.  Not a fan. The duck rolls were reminiscent of Peking duck, except the duck was served room temperature and no crispy skin, however it was wrapped in a thin wrapper with green onion and chun jang black bean paste...so I guess it could have been hoisin?

They are not claiming to be a Korean traditional restaurant, and if you want that, there are lots of places you can go. The reason to come here is to explore the fusion food and cool atmosphere. I thought the service was great, and actually the food was good. The reason I am not giving them 4 stars is that I honestly don't think I would go back. Not because there is anything wrong with them- I had a great evening there.

4.0,9/18/2009,"OK, so it's not 'traditional' Korean. They don't pretend to be, they freely admit to taking liberties with traditional recipes (although I was informed they are not 'fusion'). The atmosphere is great: tasteful, sleek, trendy. The wait staff in both the bar and dining room were very helpful, professional and knowledgeable. We started our evening in the bar for 'Happy Hour': five dollars drinks and small plates...think Asian tapas. We loved the dungeness crab rolls and tempura sea bass maki.The bass was very flavourful and very lightly coated. IMO the tempura could have  been thicker and therefore imparted more of the crunch I look for in a tempura roll...but surely I am being fussy. Drinks were nice; my companion loved her shoju cocktail, flavoured with lychee we think. We liked it so much we stayed for dinner and moved into the dining room. We decided upon the barbecue platter for two: bulgogi, short ribs and shrimp with all the usual sides: kim chee, daikon, cucumber, bean paste, etc. The meal was both delicious and fun...that's the idea right...to have a good time? We certainly did! The sake menu was a bit short: 10-12 items; but those chosen are true to type and of good quality. I chose a familiar junmai dai ginjgu. It was a little more than I usually pay, but the restaurant is beautiful, the staff talented, and you get what you pay for. Sure, it's not cheap eats. There are plenty of Korean places like that.

4.0,2/12/2009,"On a recent trip to New York, my family and I went seeking new dining experiences.  There's a relative scarcity of Korean food available in their home area of South Florida, where the general concept of ethnic diversity is Latin American vs. American (I mean, great Cuban sandwiches, but it really shouldn't be a treasured event to go get some Pho...) and a lot of people's ideas of good Asian food mean P.F. Chang's (I spit on P.F. Chang's!). Ironically, my parents, who have spent many years traveling throughout the Far East had never experienced Korean BBQ.  I found Bann through a search on my phone*, and we walked the short distance from our hotel to the restaurant. Bann is a marked difference from the usual Korean BBQs I frequent in Atlanta--the atmosphere is definitely more upscale, with modern design and attractive waitstaff.  When we entered, I noticed a high level of noise, akin to the earlier, less-crowded hours at a hip nightclub.  On that particular night, the clientele trended young--significantly younger than my middle-aged/senior parents, but since we were tourists, we took it in stride. We ordered a combination meal for four (unfortunately, something I cannot find on the menu available on their website), which came with tuna, bulgogi (marinated beef), kalbi (beef short ribs), and pork.  Presented with the usual variety of side dishes, my father, who generally just likes food he prepares himself, liked all of the food arrayed before us.  We ate well, and I'm sure Bann has made my father a fan of Korean BBQ.

4.0,2/2/2009,"so this isn't going to be a conventional review since i dined here under special circumstances, but it was so awesome i have to chime in. my cousin chose this place for the rehearsal dinner the night before her wedding, so it wasn't a normal dining experience since we had the whole place to ourselves. that being said, we had about 15 courses of awesomeness, so i think i got a fair sampling of what they have to offer. the restaurant itself is beautiful. the bar area in the front is inviting, and just large enough to accommodate big groups. walk through the little hallway, and the dining room is split into two big sections. i had a bit of a problem with the bathroom, which was far too dark and tunnel-y but overall it was great. now the food. each course came out back to back, and thumbs up to the servers. there were about 100 of us, and as far as i could tell, everyone was fed and watered, wined and dined, whatever you want to call it, with no complaints and no lags in service. so it's not traditional korean food, but obviously this place is far from traditional. i loved the presentation of everything, because while i love korean food, i have to admit authentic korean restaurants don't really take an interest in plating all their yummy food. my favorite restaurants in korea simply scoop/toss food into plastic/metal dishes. tasty, yes but visually appealing, no. standouts were the cod and daikon in the soy garlic reduction, ahi tuna with apples, the cold duck appetizer, and all of the bbq dishes. i noticed that they had the grills built into the tables, but our bbq dishes were brought out pre-grilled. so yeah, pretty much everything was awesome, and i wish i lived closer so i could eat here more often!",1,0,1,Jess R.,"Los Angeles, CA",229,172,21

3.0,1/29/2009,"Food 2.5: Decor: 4 Service 4: Price: 3If you insist on just eating traditional Korean cuisine, u should just stop reading the review and not visit this place. They do offer some of the traditional fare, but other than bibimbap, I find most of the food either sweeter, requiring more fermentation or bland. For example, kimchi is almost like a cabbage salad. Pretty tasty, but certainly not your traditional kimchi (it is not similar to gert-jeol-e, which is a kind of kimchi that is not fermented). The sauce that most meat is marinated with is slightly sweeter than usual. Some like it, some don't. I am of the former. I do like the ambiance of the restaurant though. Definitely somewhere you can bring a date without fear of coming out smelling too much of Korean food. Service is as good as the decor. Very attentive and professional staff. My friend has also told me that they are good at explaining the items in the menu. Which is a must because there are more non-Koreans in this place compared to the Korean restaurants in the K-town area.

I don't usually get bbq at Bann, b/c the other entrees on their menu are sooo good: short rib/kalbi, soy black cod, seafood pancake *yum*!!Took one star down for price, and because they always bring you your white rice with your salad....and then the rice gets cold by the time your entree shows up. who likes cold rice??",1,0,0,lillian l.,"New York, NY",0,96,34
4.0,1/10/2008,"Bann is a delicious Korean restaurant by the same team that brought us Woo Lae Oak.   Bann is equally tasty and hip as its NYC predecesor, but in a much less cool area.  The entrance is tucked away in a courtyard between two apartment buildings only a few blocks from the craziness of Times Square and is easy to miss.  Upon entering the restaurant, there is a spacious, but sparsely furnished, lounge and a well-stocked bar.  To the right of this area is a large, elegant dining room with beautiful cherry wood walls.  My one complaint about the environment was the fact that it was the coldest day of the season and the heat was not working.  They added a few space heaters, but they did not help much.  I had to eat with my coat on.  The actual waiter service was attentive and friendly, though.In terms of beverages, they have an amazing selection of saketini's, cocktails, and wines.  They also have some delicious tea.When it comes to food, the selection includes traditional Korean dishes, fusion specialties, and BBQ.  The menu is essentially the same as Woo's.  For appetizers we started with the Yook Hwe, which consisted of steak tartare, jicama, and basil wrapped in daikon radish and cut in large rolls, similar to a spring roll cut in half (and not fried).  The rolls were plated with a tangy ginger cream sauce.  Every component of the meal complemented each other and it was truly delicious.  We also ordered the Kimchi Soon Dae, which was slices of spicy beef sausage over mounds of red cabbage kimchi and drizzled with a spicy red sauce.  I usually do not eat sausage or spicy meals, but I must admit that it was very good and not overwhelmingly spicy.  We also went nuts and ordered the Pa Jun, which is a Korean scallion pancake.  It was very onion-y, but a little too greasy.  Every entree at Bann is accompanied by a delicious salad of romaine lettuce in a soy dressing, as well as a large helping of sticky white rice.  I ordered the Denjang Chige, which was a miso stew with tofu, beef, zucchini & green chili.  I was worried it would be too spicy, but it was not too bad.  The miso broth was extremely flavorful.  The beef was tender and made a good texture contrast to the crisp vegetables.  It was amazing!  My friend ordered the Dolsot Bi Bimbap, which was crisp rice cooked and served in a hot stone pot with vegetables and beef.  It was also very tasty.  The waiter adds spicy sauce to customize for your tolerance level.  You can also get the dish with five grain jasmine rice if you want to try something a bit healthier.All in all, I highly recommend Bann!",2,0,2,Alison C.,"Hoboken, NJ",1125,1410,640
5.0,12/22/2007,"My absolute FAVORITE restaurant in the city for a special occasion!  Anything to celebrate???? this place is fantastic... and not to mention my husband and i had our first date here....  It is korean BBQ.... they marinate  all of the meat in a sauce that you cannot even wrap your mind around... you cook it on a grill at your table... We always get the lettuce wraps... The pre-dinner salad is incredible (salad... i know... the dressing is unbelievable).  The atmosphere is very romantic and we always have a fun time, chatting, and cooking, and making concoctions of meat, veggies, and incredible provided sauces.  They have cocktails... like the lychee martini, and green tea inspired drinks... And the service has never failed to impress.... CHECK IT OUT!!!",3,2,3,Jenna C.,"Chicago, IL",589,618,22
4.0,12/8/2007,"No, this is not K-town.  No place in K-town would be this spacious and well-laid out.  Bann is the kind of place you visit to have a trendy/nice experience...and you just happen to be eating tasty Korean-lite food.The prices, for being a trendy fusion-esque Asian restaurant, are pretty decent.  I actually only had the glass noodle appetizer, and it was just the right size for me for lunch.  My friend had the bul gogi--and it was huuuge!  With the addition of rice, we figured she had enough food to feed a small family in her sexy doggy bag (that's right--I said sexy!).  Good Korean food (nowhere near the best, but such a nicer experience than eating in K-town).  Very solid saketini.  And *such* a hot waiter.  If you're in the area, and are so over Thalia or any of those other overdone pre-theatre places, I'd check out Bann.  If you want cheap, tasty, and super-authentic food while getting the eye from a hostess who can't wait to turn your table already...well, then go to K-town.",1,0,1,Barbara C.,"London, United Kingdom",84,226,4
5.0,11/7/2007,"Bann is Korean but what we were served was more like asian fusion.I was lucky enough to grab free dinner (it's called loading up on hor's devours) and free booze at Bann for a publicity event for The Farnsworth Invention. The event was held in the bar area rather than the main dining room. It was a tight squeeze but sometimes it's fun to be jam packed with people. Booze was free flowing with white wine, lychee martinis, cosmopolitans, and lemon drops. The lychee martini was very very good and the lemon drop was decent. If you arrived early enough (which I did), the drinks (wine exempt) were served in martini glasses. Towards the end of the night, the drinks were being served in smaller cups.  I think they just ran out of dishes. Wine, however, was in giant wine glasses. Filled! This was a night to get your slosh on. The food was free flowing as well. Bann did a great job of refilling the tables. There were two set ups- one with the warming dishes and the other was a buffet. On the menu was beef cubes that were stewed to perfection. The meat was really soft and flavorful. There were balls of black rice coated with sesame seeds. Those were tasteless. The califonia rolls and gyoza were standard (4 stars). There were little puff pastries filled with cream cheese and tuna. Sooo good. And to top it all off was spicy chicken, lollipop style. I had my fill and the drinks were really good. I didn't get a chance to see the real menu. This was all party food but since it was good, its an indication of what is yet to be served in the dining room.Bann is a pretty cool restaurant. The bar is dark but lit enough so you can see your partner. There are tiny tables along the walls which grant privacy. This isn't just a bar where you grab your drink and stand. You can actually sit and chill. In the middle there is seating where the benches are adorned with cheetah print cushions (quite comfy too!). Asiany scrolls and asian art are hung on the walls. Overall, Bann is nicely decorated. It's trendy and cool all while doing justice to traditional Asian art.",3,1,3,Rachel A.,"Brooklyn, NY",732,1493,1730
4.0,7/29/2007,"I went there twice for dinner. We had a great service. The place looks very nice. We had scallops, salmon and shrimps Korean BBQ. We also tried the first vegetable fried rice on the menu. But anything you take comes with  unlimited white rice and vegetables. All the food was DELICIOUS !! I just love it. You have to try this place !!The second time I wanted to try their desserts : I had this tropical coconut ice cream that came in a crushed ice bowl. I had asked to have the toppings of the side and I would recommend you to do the same because some of them are a little weird. It was good and original  but not amazing. My friend ordered a hot chocolate cake that they forgot to bring so then we received a complimentary ice cream  (red beans and vanilla beans) and they did not charge us either for the chocolate cake. I would say that overall desserts look nicer than they are good!To conclude, this is a very nice place, it does not smell, service is very good... Enjoy my friends!",0,0,0,Stella S.,"NY, NY",2,39,0
5.0,4/11/2007,"Everything I had was delicious! I'm Korean and from LA so I know my korean bbq! This was the first time I had really good Korean food in NYC, after several disappointments in the tiny area y'all call Ktown. I like the modern/fusion spin - the dishes tasted authentic but they also had interesting non-traditional items. I was there for an event, though, so I have no idea how pricey it is. The fact that you don't leave stinking like smoky meat is GREAT too.",2,0,2,Lin H.,"New York, NY",74,257,5
4.0,1/18/2007,"The problem with Bann is that people feel the need to compare it to K-town. I just dont think thats a valid comparison ... If you are looking for an authentic Korean meal with few frills go to K-town the food is great and the prices arent bad either. But if you are looking for a trendier night out with good cocktails and food that isnt quite so traditional I recommend you try out Bann (or Woo Lae Oak for that matter).I recommend the scallop appetizer, the Bulgogi is quite solid and if youre feeling a little crazy try the Tuna barbecue - yes Bann lets you barbecue things other than red meat and seafood.",2,0,2,Ashnil D.,"New York, NY",8,18,2
3.0,7/5/2006,"I wanted to love the place. Really, I did.  Bann is a part of the Woo Lae Oak empire and does succeed in combining modern design with Korean cuisine.  The menu does offer some interesting preparations of classic dishes as well as new twists with Korean ingredients, so kudos to that.  Only issue - most of the dishes are too sweet and prepared more for American tastebuds.  Don't get me wrong; I've been to Bann several times due to the proximity to Midtown and for the fact that you don't walk out smelling like a bbq pit, but for great Korean food, you're better off heading to K-town and wearing machine wash clothing.",2,0,1,Nomnom C.,"New York, NY",1,15,0
4.0,3/27/2006,"The theater district needed a grand, stylish, modern Korean restaurant, and the owners of Woo Lae Oak of Soho fame stepped up to the challenge. Bann's cavernous space is sleek, dark, and industrial with smooth concrete floors; cocoa-colored wooden chairs, tables and benches; imported temple tiles; hanging embroidered scrolls that serve as partitions; floor-to-ceiling rice paper-lined windows; and a translucent window that looks into the kitchen from the dining room.  The menu is no less elaborate; it's printed on rice paper and is bound in embroidered, leather scrolls.  While Bann has some repeat dishes from its Soho sister, its menu is completely in English with many additions of creative fusion dishes, and also boasts a huge section of seafood and meats (from scallops to sweetbreads) to order for the built-in gas grill at your table. If you're expecting traditional Korean dishes, you're better off going to 32nd Street for quality standard fare, but if you're looking for something more upscale, expensive, inventive, and influenced by other cultures, this is the right place.  The food we ordered was fantastic: moist shreds of Dungeness crab meat  and leek wrapped in tiny spinach crepes*, pan-fried, and served with a light mustard sauce; cold lobster meat and roasted beets wrapped in a paper thin slice of pickled daikon; their take on the scallion pancake which came out thick like a spanish tortilla (I prefer the traditional thin, pan fried kind); crispy oyster tempura balls with a silky tofu and prawn mixture inside surrounding the oyster*; a juicy beef and kimchi sausage* served over baked cabbage; braised black cod simmered in a spicy garlic soy sauce; succulent braised short rib that fell apart in my mouth in a sweet sake soy sauce glaze with pumpkin (which could have been a bit softer); a rich kimchi stew with bits of Korean bacon and onions (this is something you can get in any Korean restaurant, though); a side order of sizzling, slightly sweet 5 grain rice; and side dishes of assorted kimchi (normally free on 32nd street, $3 a pop here).  For dessert, the warm chocolate cake* was one of the best I've ever had: rich, but also light and airy...the center oozing with a milky chocolate sauce and served with a vanilla bean sorbet. If I can ever afford to go back (it was pretty expensive), I will definitely try the grill as well as some intriguing dishes like the seared foie gras over mung bean polenta, baked tofu with chili pesto rolled in phyllo pastry, and baked sea scallops with shrimp mousse baked with mushrooms. (*=my favorite dishes)",4,0,3,margie l.,"New York, NY",36,22,0
