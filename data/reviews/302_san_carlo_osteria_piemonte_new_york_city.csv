5.0,4/23/2019,"I'm so glad my husband and I got to experience this restaurant for dinner. It's a great neighborhood spot and very cozy. The owner came over and talked to us about the Piemonte region of Italy and made some great food recommendations that we decided to try. For an appetizer we shared the spinach, mushroom, and goat cheese salad. It was so different and the goat cheese was so creamy. For our entrees I had the homemade meat ravioli in a butter and sage sauce that just melted in my mouth. My husband had the rib eye and said it was amazing and cooked to perfection. For dessert, we shared the panna cotta that was in a strawberry coulis with crumbled pistachios.  One of the best panna cotta desserts we've ever had. We sat at the bar and our bartender had great recommendations for wines to go with our food. I highly recommend this restaurant.

5.0,3/11/2019,By far...my most favorite Italian Restaurant in NYC.  I always go here.  The TAJARIN PASTA is my ultimate desire here.  You can get it with truffles (when in season) but if you want a lesser priced check get it without the truffles and you'll still be satisfied in a most delightful way.  I feel like I'm in Italy whenever I visit here.  It's truly the best (& I mean everything on the menu is worthy of ordering).,0,0,0,Michael A.,"Marina del Rey, CA",213,54,3
5.0,2/25/2019,"I went to San Carlo 90 in Soho with a few friends a couple of nights ago. We not only had a fantastic meal but we could actually hear ourselves (in a full restaurant!)We had a meat ravioli with a butter-sage sauce, it was not only beautiful to look at, it tasted amazing! We also had veal Milanese. It was cooked to a perfect golden brown and I did NOT need a knife..it was like buttah, my fork was all I needed to cut this delightful meat. I'm sure if you don't eat veal, they can make it with chicken. But wait..to top off this delicious beauty of a meal, the deserts came out & i almost fainted! (Glad I didn't because my friends would have eaten it before they got the smelling salt!)The waiters were charming, knew their wine and were very helpful. The owner Moreno came to check on us and chatted for awhile. He's was so nice (not to mention easy on the eyes.)This place is my new Soho favorite and I will make any opportunity to travel from the ues to have this experience many times again. If you live around there, consider yourself lucky. If you're like me & live a #6 train away, it's worth the short trip. I would give this restaurant more than 5 stars if I could!

Crowds were standing around out front but a manager made eye contact and seated us immediately. From that moment, every step of the meal was flawless. Drinks, wine service, appetizers and entrees were all above expectation. Our server was just phenomenal. Very knowledgeable about the restaurant, honest about recommendations- and had the perfect timing of keeping us engaged without being overly-attentive. The shrimp risotto was by far the best meal of our 5 nights in Manhattan.My husband even got to share a drink with a friendly celeb sitting at the bar on our way out.

4.0,2/16/2019,"KenScale: 8.0/10After our marriage, my wife Jun and I had not been to Italian restaurants as often as we used to for a number of reasons, one of which is that Jun cooks some really delicious pastas at home that I am confident can stand up to any Italian restaurant in the city. For a casual dinner with friends, however, Italian restaurants do come in handy. One of Jun's good friends who left NYC a while ago was coming to visit and I figured this was a good opportunity to try one of the Italian restaurants in the city that we had not yet been. After some searching, I chose San Carlo Osteria Piemonte which focuses on cuisine from the northern region of Piedmont. It turned out to be a smart decision, as a lot of the dishes that we tried were quite delicious.My biggest complaint with Italian restaurants in NYC has been the overuse of salt and other seasoning condiments to juice up the flavor to cater to American diners. San Carlo thankfully avoids a lot of that issue, and retains great balance of flavor in its dishes. While Jun was preoccupied catching up with her friend on the good old days they parties in the city, I was able to focus a bit more on the food. I thought the vitello tonnato made with thinly sliced veal eye round was excellent in texture, and the tuna sauce provided just the right amount of flavor boost. Pan seared scallops that came with cauliflower foam, anchovies and garlic dressing and polenta chips was another winner in the appetizer department that I was glad to take two out of four on the plate while the girls were chatting. Jun can make a splendid meat ragu pasta that has drawn praise from our guests when we host a dinner party; if I am a pescatarian, I think the seafood ragu based rigatoni at San Carlo would have been a nice replacement. Between the two pastas that we had ordered, though, the one that I will keep thinking about will be the delicious spaghetti with anchovies and onions sauce that gave pleasantly earthy taste. The duck breast accmopaied by celery root puree and raspberry vinaigrette that we ordered as the lone main dish was serviceable in texture, but didn't outshine the previous dishes that we had sampled. For dessert, panna cotta with strawberries coulis and pistachio crumble is a must-order dish where the silky smooth panna cotta works beautifully with the crumble. Tiramisu is not a bad dessert to have either, although I feel like Jun and I had tried better ones at other places in and out of NYC.Getting a reservation at San Carlo wasn't too challenging but the dining room filled up very quickly during our meal so booking in advance is highly recommended. The restaurant has a typical downtown neighborhood restaurant vibe that will help with a pleasant dining experience, although the noise during prime time is something you will need to consider. There is a full bar at San Carlo, and the wine list is not surprisingly focused heavily on Italian wines (we tried an interesting syrah blend from Tuscany that really grew on me during our meal). If you are looking for a solid Italian dinner in downtown Manhattan at a place that is not super-crowded and somewhat off the foodie radar, San Carlo is an excellent option to consider.",2,1,1,Ken S.,"Manhattan, NY",512,612,4738

5.0,12/9/2018,"My wife and I were visiting New York City and wanted to find a good, unique restaurant in the Village at which to enjoy a special dinner.  This place was (nearly) perfect.Here is what stood out:- We had a reservation at 8:30pm on a Saturday night.  We arrived right on time, but the table wasn't ready yet so they found us a place at the bar.  We had already been drinking elsewhere before dinner, so we just waited for the table to vacate...maybe 15 minutes or so.- A sommelier came to the table really quickly...we wanted to order wine by the glass and he was knowledgeable and helpful, letting me taste one of the wines before I chose.- The food was incredible.  We started with the scallops appetizer...only got two of them, but they were amazing (actually a highlight of the entire meal for my wife).  Then we each shared the Spinach Gnocchi and splurged on the angel hair pasta with white truffles.  As expected, the angel hair was amazing, great homemade taste, and the truffles...what can I say?  They are what called me to this restaurant in the first place.  However, the gnocchi was really a surprise...some of the best that we'd had in a while.- We skipped dessert and just enjoyed a good cup of black coffee...yum!- Atmosphere was definitely New York sheek, lots of bustle but not too loud.  Service was really good...it seemed like several people were taking care of us, and they must have been watching closely since we always felt well tended, but no one was overbearing.Bottom line:  Top notch!",0,0,0,John M.,"Cardiff, CA",0,215,225

4.0,10/21/2018,"Short version: enjoyed my dinner, and I will most likely back--mainly for the wine and pasta. Back to our regularly scheduled programming: I went out with my people from nursing school, post graduation yesterday. It was amazing to finally catch up. As the resident foodie and yelper, the burden fell on me for a location. Enter San Carlo. Aesthetics and Ambience: the space is small, dimly lit and orchestrated to fit as maybe people as possible. I loved it. Food: we began with some antipasti of anchovie toast. The anchovies were extremely salty. And considering this was my first time trying them, it's safe to say I will not again. We also had una ensalada that was surprisingly tasty with a tangy dressing that I enjoyed. Oh! And there was plenty of complementary bread and oil. The carb lover in me did an internal jig.Moving on to primi. I had the Lasagnette Allo Zafferano Con Tonno di Coniglio. My first time trying rabbit. The lasagnette itself was cooked beautifully. I want to say almost al dente. The rabbit was slow cooked and a new taste-- it was good, just perhaps not something I'd have frequently. My friends had the spaghetti; secondi: merluzzo su variazione and the ombrina, brodettto di cavalo--cod and bass. Tried both. Absolutely lovely. Dessert: A delicious, espresso tiramisu; a flan that did not taste like flan (MY GOODNESS), and an affogatto that enthralled my taste buds. LET US NOT FORGET ALCOHOL: I had the Autumn de Turni-- it has bourbon and lime. I'll stop there because I already named what made it bomb: bourbon. French had the Bee's Tees. Neither one were particularly sweet, which I was content with. I chose the wine for the night, as I am wont to do: Parchehof Riesling. Light, airy. A delicious white that paired well with the majority of our dishes. Service: This is where I name names. Huge shoutout to Miko and Moreno. Moreno handle my libations while I waited outside for my late friends. You guys should know I don't do well with late company, so alcohol for the wait. Miko, my lovely waiter, was knowledgeable, attentive and sweet. Joy. A truly amazing Italian welcome. The boisterousness of the staff made it a comfortable experience. Okay, I'm done. As always, happy eating and drinking. MarieMG",0,0,1,Marie-Madeleine G.,"Brooklyn, NY",41,85,201

5.0,10/8/2018,"My boyfriend is from the Piemonte region of Italy, home of black and (rare) white truffles galore. So every time I rave to him about my love of all things truffle he gives me a ""you know nothing Jon Snow"" look. The food I've been eating doused in truffle oil he tells me, not even close to the real deal. This weekend, he finally got to prove his point. San Carlo is the namesake of a major square in Turin, from where the restaurant sources its origin and inspiration. For those seeking pizza and richer pastas, walk a few blocks down to Napoli restaurants like Song e Napule instead. San Carlo delivers a unique, authentic taste of Northern Italy - an entirely new flavor, for me. We started with the Tonno di Coniglio, a jar of poached, pulled rabbit with a side of picked veggies. Yup, poached, pulled rabbit. In a a jar. It's somehow more tender and decadent than pulled pork and yet not too heavy or fatty as pork can be. It's served at room temperature in an oil. The veggies add a nice acidic kick to the dish. For our mains, we had the Tagliatelle Al Brasato (braised boar) and from the Truffle Menu (swoon) the Tajarin Alba, angel hair pasta with truffle butter topped with fresh white truffle from the Alba region of Cuneo (just in case you want to know where to go truffle hunting). The waiter brings out the truffle and grates it onto the pasta in front of you. The braised boar tagliatelle was delicious too, but let me just get to the point of this whole review: the white truffle. In my experience with truffle, it's a flavor that kind of punches you in the face with the smell and taste. It hits all the right brain cells and taste buds. This was different. It was subtle, yet ultimately just as powerful. At first I didn't register much sensory information besides al dente pasta, light buttery sauce, and a subtle truffle flavor. But when I looked down, half the pasta was gone! The flavor was decadent, addicting, and umami without being overwhelming. At this point I realized the truffle flavors I had before were often likely synthetic, or at least, enhanced. Overall it was a truly new taste experience for me, though rather fleeting... The waiter brought us a tasting glass of a sweet moscato to close the meal and thus concluded my first lesson in truffle. It certainly comes at a cost... but I think it's a worthwhile investment. Until I can make it out to Alba with a truffle pig, San Carlo will be my go to in NYC to further my truffle education.",4,1,3,Jennifer D.,"Brooklyn, NY",947,354,618

My friend even pointed out how the quality of burrata was very average.Third, the Veal Milanese I ordered was very average and lacked seasoning.

My Beef Tart Tarta was delicious.  I had the Branzino - it was a filet - grilled with the a crispy skin. Absolutely divine! I felt like I was back in the South of Italy.  For dessert we had the white Chocolate mouse with compote grapes and a delicious crisp cookie.  Our Sommelier was amazing. He helped us pare our wines to the food that we were eating - Well done! Thank for recommendations!!! Our waiter he was nice, but didn't come up to us to ask if our food was good or if we were enjoying our time. He needs more customer service skills.

I'm a small person (not that should matter in any restaurant in this matter) and i was so worried that I would knock things over or elbow the next table lol.

Paid with my card and when it came back there was no original receipt. I was studying it and the waiter was standing over me ""tip included"".  I signed and he grabbed it off me.  I used the bathroom and realised the final bill was significantly more than it should have been.   I asked another staff member to see the bill again.  They started searching and the waiter came over. Found the original bill and then he went to another area scrunching that receipt up on the way.  Confirmed he had overcharged me. He then tried to give me$5 in change.  This did not cover the over charge. Started trying to tell me it was 18% tip Explained I was happy to pay 20% and I needed more change. Tried to give me $2 more.  By this time I was getting unhappy.   He knew he had deliberately over charged and was trying to get me out of there as quickly as possible.

5.0,8/29/2018,"Let me tell you about how much they care about your experience.I ordered a martini. I told the waiter Beefeater, because it's a solid gin that just about every bar has. Well, the bartender had two other gins that he thought I'd like better, so he brought me a FULL SHOT OF EACH to taste and choose.Now, I'm not a drunk.* So I would've appreciated the fact that they wanted me to sample better liquor options even if they didn't get me good and liquored up for the price of just one martini. But they did. And I liked it. And if you are thinking that my wife took advantage of me that night, you're right. It's not just the excessive amounts of gin though; San Carlo Osteria Piemonte also happens to be an excellent Italian restaurant all around. The hospitality is second to none, with the added bonus of just about everyone having a thick Italian accent. Our waiter accidentally slipped into rapid-fire Italian as he was explaining the Ricottina di Bufala, a beautiful ricotta that came in a bath of chilled cantaloupe soup that I had to try because I'd never heard of such a thing (worth it).The pastas are delicious. The agnolotti in butter and sage is simple and perfect, and the homemade tagliatelle with a wild boar ragu is everything I wanted it to be. But the the obvious dedication to diner satisfaction, and the warm welcome from each and every person in there, that's what makes San Carlo special.

Perhaps it's not as high quality, but it still added some meaty flavor to the dish. I'm surprised at how much steak I got for my appetizer. I was quite full by the time I was done with the steak tartare. I was initially concerned about the quality of the steak but it was tender. My mom got the veal and it was very tender. The veal on its own tasted bland, but if you eat it with the cream on the side, it provided the salt that the veal needed. As for the entree, the branzino was cooked perfectly although the skin was salted a little too much. I got the steak and potatoes and it was okay. The steak wasn't overcooked as I ordered medium, but I think they could've had a better cut and more flavorful. My dessert which was some kind of panna cotta was overly sweet. The tiramisu was quite nice and balanced out the other sweet dessert. I like this lunch spot and the staff are all very nice.",1,0,1,Nilsa L.,"Brooklyn, NY",58,295,352

5.0,7/31/2018,"This was one of my favorite dining experiences in NYC. Though we ordered off their $26 restaurant week lunch menu, my friend and I decided to splurge and order their beef tartare with black summer truffles (+$8), truffle pasta (+$12), and their steak. For starters, we definitely didn't expect there to be so much truffle on the dishes nor did we anticipate having their black summer truffles shaved directly into our beef tartare when the food was out in front of us. The first bite of the beef tartare with truffle was heavenly!!!! Melt in your mouth good, with wisps of garlic and pepper mixed in with each bite. My friend and I shared the pasta and steak as we wanted to try both. Again they shaved a healthy and sizable amount of truffle onto the pasta before we dug in. The pasta itself was cooked al dente though it was slightly on the saltier side. The steak was cooked to perfection! Beautiful pink center with a perfectly crisp and flavorful crust. We thoroughly enjoyed our appetizers and entrées! Just when we thought we couldn't eat any more.... their tiramisu arrived! Who knew it would be the perfect end to our meal? The tiramisu wasn't too sweet nor did it have an overpowering taste of amaretto which can taste bitter. Overall, I would rate this 10 stars if it were possible! I'd definitely come back for lunch or dinner regardless of restaurant week!

5.0,7/4/2018,"A really nice addition to the South Village dining scene.  San Carlo Osteria is a stylish and small space serving some very good food.  It is also nice to see dishes a little out of the ordinary.  Since they had a special truffle menu, we started with a dish of Tajarin with truffle butter that had shaved truffle on top.  It was probably the best taste of the night.  I would have happily eaten the whole thing instead of splitting it four ways.  The pasta was homemade and cooked so it was nice and chewy.We also shared a plate of Fried Zucchini Blossoms Stuffed with Baccala which were served with a sweet, sour and ever so slightly spicy sauce.  There was a nice saltiness to the Blossoms both from the batter and the Baccala stuffing.  They were also delicious.For mains we had a risotto with asparagus which was rich and tasted as expected, a full flavored ragu with shredded wild boar, Monkfish with a saffron potato sauce which may have been the best tasting entree, and Pan Seared Branzino which was very good, but my least favorite dish.  Given that they make their own pastas, I would probably opt for that on my next visit.  They make a spaghetti with black garlic and spicy breadcrumbs that sounds intriguing.Service was attentive and food came out reasonably quickly considering there was a party of 16 at a series of adjoining tables.There are lots of things I would like to try so I expect to be back.",0,0,0,Mark B.,"Short Hills, NJ",0,85,8
1.0,6/23/2018,"Really hated the bartender's attitude. He seemed upset the whole time we were there, would barely look at any of the customers although it was only 6 patrons sitting at the bar. He seemed too busy cleaning the bar area instead of giving service to the people. What I hated the most was the way he spoke to one of the waiters or busboys. He was very rude to him in front of the clients and made him feel bad. Then he spent minutes complaining about the same guy to one of his peers signaling him with his hand. He was speaking in Italian but it was very obvious to everyone. This made me feel very uncomfortable as I don't appreciate when staff gets mistreated.",1,0,0,Liliana Z.,"Miami, FL",44,88,77

When I arrived, I was greeted by the bartender and decided to sit at the bar as a party of one. It is a quaint restaurant that's not overly spacious but it does provide tons of outdoor lighting. I started with the Insalata San Carlo, which was nicely seasoned with pepper. What I enjoyed was that the salad wasn't drenched in dressing. I then proceeded to order the Tagliatelle al Ragu'. The entree and salad were delectable and didn't leave me with an empty stomach. The bartender went above and beyond to make me feel welcome and repeatedly refilled my water.

5.0,5/3/2018,"My husband and I live in the area and San Carlo is our go-to restaurant.  We have been coming here consistently since it opened and have always had a wonderful experience.  The service is always warm and friendly, they even treat our two year old son like he is a regular and always come over to say ""Ciao"" to him. The food is always delicious and their wine selection is great.  My husband loves the Vitello Tonnato.  The food is northern Italian cuisine (Piedmonte) so you get different flavors than you would at a southern Italian restaurant, which is a nice change.  When my parents come into the city for family dinners my father always wants to come here.  As he said ""they treat us like family, why would I want to go anywhere else.""  My husband is from Italy and when our Italian family comes to visit we always take them here as well because we know they will always be happy with the experience...and they are tough to please when it comes to food!  The owners really care about the restaurant and you will always see them there, walking around and making sure everyone is happy.  Their dedication to the restaurant shows in every aspect service, food and ambiance.  If you are looking to have a great night out, I cannot recommend San Carlo highly enough!",0,0,0,Ali B.,"Manhattan, NY",0,10,0

4.0,4/16/2018,"Another great place discovered by using the Hooch app!  I came here with two friends for a light dinner after attending an event nearby.  I decided to get Autumn in New York as my drink.  It had Bourbon, Red wine, lemon juice and cinnamon syrup topped off with some sliced fruits.  If an old fashioned and a Sangria had a baby this is what it would be.  Fruity at the start and a mild taste of bourbon in the middle finishing with a hint of cinnamon at the end.  For my meal I had the crema di riso venere con calamari e cozze which is a creamy soup made of venere, an Italian black rice, with squid and mussels mixed in.  The soup was extremely smooth and was quite hearty.  The dish was topped with some toasted venere which gave a fun texture contrast to the soup and added to the roasted flavors.  Calamari and mussels were tender and flavorful.  Only complaint here was that there was a bit of sand in two of the mussels.  I also go to try some of the branzino, porri e insalatina di finocchi which is Mediterranean Sea bass with leek emulsion, shaved fennel salad topped with black olive crumbs.  Fish was cooked perfectly and tasted good with the leek emulsion.  The olive crumbs seem to be toasted and do not really resemble olives at all, but was a welcome addition to each bite of sea bass and fennel salad.  The crumbs were crunchy and had smokey/toasty flavors with a hint of salinity.We were impressed with the meal so we decided to try the desserts.  The torta di pinoli con zabaione caldo which is a pine nut cake with a warm egg custard made with Marsala wine was our favorite.  The cake was soft and moist with whole pine nuts dispersed throughout.  It went well with the zabaione that was lemony and smooth.Service was excellent.  The first receipt we received did not have the Hooch discount applied, but it was quickly corrected once we pointed it out.  I'd stop by here in the future to try some munique Italian food.",2,0,2,Kelly D.,"Merrick, NY",223,260,865

2.0,3/24/2018,"Before ordering brunch, we looked around at the other other tables for guidance (saw indifferent looking heaps of pasta with red sauce and a plate of very flat pan fried chicken milanese) and decided to order the ""Catch of the Day"" (roast salmon, roasted fingerling potatoes and pan fried Brussel Sprouts) and a burger (topped with Gorgonzola cheese and sautéed onions with fries and small salad). The restaurant was about half full, mostly with Italian speaking patrons. Service was rather slow, and the food was intensely salty. The fries had more salt than one would get at McDonald's. I ordered the burger medium rare, but it was overcooked (past medium). And is there any need to salt ground meat before cooking when it's served with salty melted Gorgonzola on top?  I only tasted the other dish. Also too salty by 50%. Even though the salmon was fully cooked (a bit overcooked), and salty, I could taste/smell that the fish was slightly off, a day or two past prime, prior to cooking. The fish / potato / brussell sprouts portion was also too small for the plate (is there a legal minimum number of brussell sprouts to constitute a side dish?) With one glass of OK Pinot Nero wine, tax and tip, the bill for 2 was $55. We left the restaurant: (a) thirsty; (b) with more than our 2,300 milligram maximum daily allowance of sodium; and (c) never to return.

4.0,3/11/2018,"I was looking for a change of pace Italian restaurant downtown.  I came across San Carlo on a couple of sites.  It's relatively new and a little bit different, so we went for it.  Our party of 8 was seated promptly upon arrival.  The space was small and charming.  The crowd morphed from a mixed group into a younger, hipper crowd as the night went on.  Our waiter was a total character and a great guy.  He spent a lot of time with us and was happy to discuss the menu and wine list in depth.  Just like in Italy, he wasn't above an eye roll when he thought we were not with the program.  We almost asked him to pull up a chair.In spite of our charming waiter, the service was not quite up to the level of the charming space or the food.  It took us a while to get menus and a wine list. Bread and olive oil weren't served until around the time that we got our appetizers.  Most annoyingly, the appetizers and main courses were doled out over a long time.  There were frequent choruses of ""please start, don't wait for me to be served"" during the meal. This is a pet peeve of mine.  I don't understand how this can happen in an otherwise fine restaurant.  We drank a bunch of well priced Hilberg Barbera d'Alba.  The bread and olive oil were excellent.  I started with the salami and burrata- excellent.  My wife started with the eggplant parmigiana and loved it.  The pastas were very good.  I had a top 10 veal Milanese for my main dish.  My wife had tagliatelle with mushrooms and liked it a lot.  The Arctic char was very good.  The only miss was the bollito misto.  It was sold to my buddy as an authentic Piedmontese stew.  It was a sampling of meats with accompanying broth and some sauces on the side to season everything.  It was underwhelming.Desserts were really good.  The semifreddo was off the charts.  The pine nut cake was really good, as were the biscotti.  We finished everything off with some astringent grappa.  I was glad to be taking Uber home!This would be a five star restaurant if only the service was a bit smoother.  We had a great evening and a great meal, aside from some buyer's remorse over the bollito misto.  I would happily return.",0,0,0,Joel S.,"New York, NY",37,675,16

If you haven't been here, then you better call and make a reservation as soon as you're finished reading this review.I walked by this restaurant one winter evening, and it looked so cozy inside. What caught my attention was that they feature dishes from the Piemonte region in Italy, where my favorite Italian wines come from, which are Barlo and Brunello. I bookmarked it immediately, and had a reservation for the upcoming weekend made on Open Table. Super easy.It was a full house at 8pm, and we waited a bit to be seated. We got our wine at the bar while they prepared our table. From what I could tell, all of the waitstaff and managers were from Italy and spoke fluent Italian. Even a lot of the patrons dining were speaking Italian! I thought, this is a good sign that the food will be excellent. And it was. I felt like I was transported back to my time in Italy with the decor, the food, and the language being spoke throughout the restaurant. It was divine.

We took the 5:30 and were seated immediately when we arrived - and were the only people in the place for the entire time we were there! That being said, when we began to order appetizers for the table to enjoy before ordering our entrees, our server told us that he would prefer that we ordered all of our food all at once! I have never experienced that in my entire life! We ordered the charcuterie plate and zucchini blossoms, which were average. Our plates were whisked away as soon as we put down our forks! Our entrees (ravioli, agnolotti, scampi, gnocchi) were a also just average - nowhere near what others have raved about in their reviews.

And somehow adding mint to this dish worked very well with all of the other flavors. The gnocchi is so light that it literally melts in your mouth. And for our main course we had the branzino which was pan seared to perfection. I cannot wait to come back to this restaurant to try the other dishes.",0,0,0,Marisa T.,"New York, NY",2,41,16
5.0,10/17/2017,"This was our third time here and it cemented our opinion that San Carlo is one of the best dining experiences you can have in the city without going bankrupt. We took our friends out for a very long overdue birthday celebration. We believe that they were satisfied. So were we. First, they are very serious about wine at San Carlo. Their bartender/somelier  (I think his name is Felipe) really knows his wine and doesn't shy away from stating his opinions. Both wines that he recommended were perfect compliments to the courses that they came with. All four of us don't like Pinot Grigio, but last night experience was the second time that Pinot Grigio was the star of the evening (the other was in Georgetown 20 years ago). Veal with tuna schmootz was out of this world, marinated rabbit was missing acidity, zucchini flower rocked, and pasta truffle app was building the desire to freeze the other people at the table and have it all to myself. The pork chop was perfectly cooked but the t-bone cut was unusual and not easy to cut. My wife's grilled seafood was as good as it was last two times (you can't skip it).In the times when TV chefs control fine dining in our city and precious few independent ones are slaves of hair-raising rents, San Carlo offers real bargain and a treat. By bargain, I mean serious food at fair price. The place is not cheap by any means.",1,0,1,Ollie S.,"Forest Hills, NY",77,117,5

Service-20 minutes seated at the bar we had to flag down Danny for a drink and felt like we interrupted his mixology show for himself. The bar is tiny with 8 seats so as much as I'd like to try and give him a break .... I'm pretty sure he saw us sit at the bar. Appetizer- ordered the VITELLO TONNATO-hate to say it ....but I think my feline would walk away.Dinner - ordered the GNOCCHI DI CASTAGNE CON FUNGHI PURCINI - overcooked - overcooked-it was so over cooked I could have plugged a dripping pipe with it or put it on a pottery spinner and made a vase. I'm sorry I wanted it to be good but it was not and had service been warmer and a little more engaging I'd give 3 stars. Overall food should be good - you can get a little creative but San Carlo overdid it with way too many ingredients and variations on preparation that they lost focus on making a meal taste good.

5.0,9/9/2016,"This is my 3rd time visiting San Carlo and I am now convinced it is the top Piedmontese restaurant in Manhattan. It excels in both charm and gastronomy. The entire menu is authentically Northern Italian with tremendous attention to detail. Highlights include: Beef Fassone Tartare w/ Quail Egg (Sfizi), Agnolotti (Primi), Costato Di Manzo (Segnudi), and The Pere (Dolce). The wine list, however, is the highlight: They have a tremendous Gattinara (Travaglini) and Barbera d'Alba (Vietti) which both come in at a bargain under $70. It is curated to perfection and I am waiting for a special occasion to pair one of their nice Barolos with the Costato Di Manzo. Brilliant. The staff is unapologetic in their sincerity and commitment to the process of enjoying a proper meal. Moreno is the face of the restaurant and a true professional while Chef Riccardo has never disappointed AND makes an effort to come out of quarters to speak with his patrons about the food. The ambiance is not lacking and the size is perfect, seating about 40 max. + the bar. San Carlo is a can't-miss for all admirers of Italian cuisine, but especially those who have fallen in love with the food and wine culture of Northern Italy.

We were waited by a server with a man bun( fashion forward ) and departed with a smile from the host. Deep down, our stomachs were happy.",0,0,1,Khai L.,"Houston, TX",194,19,19

The fried zucchini blossoms are tender cheesy and wonderful, the agnolotti and the tarjarin are AMAZING, and the scallops and octopus appetizers are out of this world. Most notable, however, is the service. The chef has made the effort to greet my part every time we have visited. The waitstaff is so attentive and thoughtful, I have sincerely never had better service. The restaurant is genuinely excited and pleased you are there, and visibly displays their enthusiasm.

5.0,7/10/2016,"I was privileged to visit Osteria San Carlo on an awesome Sunday night in Manhattan. I am originally from Italy. I was born and grew up in Piedmont, so I went there with the highest expectations. In fact, the Osteria was suggested to me by my mother after that it was featured in the local section of a popular Italian newspaper. Given that the Osteria features Piedmontese cuisine, I went for the classics. I ordered a ""Battuta di Fassona"" (just with extra-virgin olive oil, salt, and pepper), Tagliere di Salumi, Agnolotti al Sugo di Arrosto, and Bonet. I felt like home. The food was authentic, well-crafted and served with style. The Battuta di Fassona (one of the best steak tartare) was just fantastic. The meat comes from a very tender cut. It was lean and tasty. The Tagliere di Salumi (Assorted Italian Charcuterie) hit the spot. It was a well assorted selection with prosciutto, bresaola, speck and salame. Back home we have a long tradition with Agnolotti al Sugo d'Arrosto, and the ones I was served were just super. Finally, the bonet, a classic dessert that met the highest expectations.The staff is courteous and friendly. They entertained their guests with accurate recollections from Italy, Torino (the first capital), and the origin of their food and their venture. San Carlo is the name of one of the best public squares in Torino, and I thought that the choice was a nice touch. Highly recommended.",1,0,0,Alessandro A.,"Durham, NC",89,4,0
5.0,7/10/2016,"This restaurant got some positive press in an Italian newspaper that an Italian friend forwarded over.  I took a quick look on Yelp and was surprised to see 4.5 stars for a new restaurant in Soho that I had heard nothing about in the NY food blogs, (I guess this is what happens when you aren't Major food group or Mario Batali and/or don't hire the right PR firm).Anyway we didn't have any plans so I though I would check it out and WOW were we glad we did. Every appetizer and main course was spectacular.  The oh my god you need to try this sort of thing.  It was also great to see lots of regional items that aren't regularly at other NY Italian Restaurants. Some of the standouts we tried  were Vitello Tonato, Roasted red peppers, Tunar carpacio on special, Pan Seared Scallops, Veal Angolloti and a few other things I don't remember.  Desert we had a cheese plate and the bonet was good, but not as good as the rest (I am not a huge fan of Italian desserts with exception of Gelato).On the critique on portion size from Alice T. I don't know why you would expect large portions if you looked at the menu, area and pricing.  I had no trouble being filled with an app+pasta.  There is a different sort of restaurant to go to if you want a massive american heaping portion of pasta with red sauce.  Silly for a ""Elite"" to criticize a restaurant for not being another sort of restaurant.  It's like saying I was upset they didn't have a burger and fries. As noted service was extremely gracious with the Chef coming out multiple times to converse with my father about his food allergy and then check the meal was OK.Some notes for improvement:1.  I don't think the restaurant is fully leveraging the New York Blog scene etc to fill their restaurant.  2.  The red wine list may be missing some lighter American pallet friendly reds (not us wines something different from Italy in that region).  It could also just be better wine list education for the servers. 3.  I Really appreciate their commitment to regional cuisine, but they weren't full until 8 or so.  I saw many potential guests read the menu and walk by.  They could maybe put on one or two more accessible dishes for the causal American to draw in the street traffic, but that is just food for thought.P.S. I am unsure why this is listed as a wine bar.  It's a full restaurant that you could use as a wine bar, but the focus is full food not wine with small apps.",1,0,1,Steven S.,"Manhattan, NY",172,69,1
5.0,7/1/2016,"My spouse and I were staying in Soho for July 4th weekend and decided to take a walk and look for a nice dinner spot. We happened upon San Carlo and were taken by the ambience - an intimate dining room with the outer wall open to the streetscape. We sat at a table in this open area, next to a couple of Australian expats and their well behaved French bulldog.The service was superb. Three staff kept us happy and well cared for.  We both ordered potato gnocchi with walnuts, and it turned out to be the very best gnocchi we have ever had. Soft and exceptionally flavorful. We added three side dishes that came out in small Les Creuset pots. All were quite flavorful: sautéed spinach, sautéed mushroom, and polenta. We left nothing on the plate. A basket of assorted fresh breads with flavorful olive oil, two large bottles of Italian sparkling water and two glasses of wine from a very solid list finished out our fare.This is a relatively new restaurant in a district not lacking for places to eat. However, the food and execution were exceptional and we will definitely return when we are back in NYC.  Good food plus a staff happy to see you!",0,0,0,Allen G.,"Waynesboro, VA",0,19,3

Had the large salumi, squash blossoms, veal ragu w angel hair and a special pasta with pumpkin and sausage and a nice bottle of wine. Everything came out fine, but nothing stood out as great. I will give it another try and update accordingly since it is new and Italian and about 50 paces from home.

5.0,6/6/2016,"There's no shortage of great Italian restaurants in NYC, but what really makes San Carlo stand apart is their great ambience and welcoming staff. I honestly can't remember the last time I received such amazing service. Combined with the intimate space, you really do feel as if you're in a romantic hole-in-the-wall restaurant straight out of Italy.San Carlo offers a series of small plates, so I would definitely recommend coming with a few friends to share. With a few glasses of wine (the pino grigio I ordered was one of the best I've had in recent memory), the food is perfect for a light meal and a relaxing evening.We tried:+Insalata Primavera: very light; the vinaigrette had a definite orange tang to it, which was really refreshing.+ Zucchine: the lightly fired zucchini were good, but the real star of this plate was the citrus-marinated shrimp. Left whole, the shrimp was really tender and light.+ Gnocchi: had to cancel out the healthy with gnocchi doused in a cheese sauce, but no regrets here. These melted in my mouth without being really rich and overwhelming.We were also treated to a delicious tart lemon sorbet, a perfect palate cleanser for the end of the meal, and a dessert that I can only describe as a chocolate flan. Both were very light desserts, but perfect for ending the meal on a sweet note.Again, our experience was definitely augmented by the warmth of the managers and servers (and their incredible Italian accents). I'll definitely be back for that wonderful Italian hospitality, and a few more gnocchi won't hurt, either.",0,0,2,Marina S.,"Brooklyn, NY",391,374,935

1.0,5/16/2016,"I was very excited to try this place and had made reservations weeks in advance so expectations were pretty high. We had to wait 15 minutes even with a reservation and the bar was full so we were kind of in limbo between inside and outside. When we were inside, we were always in somebody's way and had to keep moving around to let people pass. That didn't bother me much, and I didn't mind waiting but the hostess constantly reminding us how amazing the chef was and why the wait was worth it was pointless and only served to raise expectations even more. Heard her say the same to a few other people who were waiting. We started with the beef tartare($19!) and it was bad. Not terrible, just bad. Chunky, flavorless and altogether disappointing. We also tried the fried squash blossom which was good. Missing something I couldn't put my finger on but I wouldn't hesitate to order it again. I ordered the braised beef agnolotti and my friend tried to order the beef cheek but they no longer carried it(nor had they carried it for weeks but left it on the menu). She ended up going with the taglierini. We tried ordering wine four times(yup, four times) but each time our waiter informed us that they were out of the wine we chose without offering any alternatives. What the hell did he expect us to do? Throw a dart at the menu until we got lucky? Eventually, we settled on no wine since, you know...what the actual fuck!? Don't servers/restaurants make their living on wine? He didn't bother suggesting a single bottle. His service overall was unspectacular but not bad I guess. Water glasses were constantly filled and he seemed available enough, though annoyed when we asked for anything.  Both of our dishes were average-slightly below average and I can't be bothered to say anything else about them. Meh. Again, I was extremely excited to eat here and it couldn't have failed to meet my expectations any harder than it did. To be honest, I want to give them another shot but that's nearly impossible to justify in New York. I almost gave them 2 stars because the meal could've been more expensive than it was but with that being their only saving grace, 1-star all around.",1,1,0,Azim D.,"New York, NY",92,58,0
3.0,5/15/2016,"We had an enjoyable evening at San Carlo Osteria, but my friends and I were pretty disappointed in the food. The restaurant is small and has a very nice, lively vibe to it. The staff is extremely friendly. This is a fun place to spend an evening with friends. My hope is that, over time, the food will match the atmosphere.In terms of menu, the pastas seem to be the best bet. They do offer Tajarin, which is a traditional pasta found in all restaurants in Piemonte. I was surprised at the lack of rabbit dishes on the menu. Almost all traditional Piemonte restaurants that I have dined at in Italy feature ""coniglio"" as a main entree selection. The only Rabbit on the menu at San Carlo is an appetizer, served in chunks marinated in a jar.  Adding a rabbit entree would benefit the menu.While the entrees (fish and meat) were, for the most part, presented very nicely - most of the diners in my group gave average marks to the overall flavor of their dish.  The ""fried"" meat entrees were particularly disappointing.  We were at the restaurant on a busy night, so perhaps the kitchen was overwhelmed and the food suffered. The wine list was more than sufficient for this size of restaurant and there were several good options on the List at various price points.  I give the bar menu  5 stars for an establishment of this size.I will give it six months and go back and try this place again. There is potential here, and I am hopeful that this will turn into a very good place.",0,0,0,H K.,"Manhattan, NY",0,20,0

We showed up without a reservation on a Thursday evening and one of the handsome owners from Italy was happy to accommodate us, and found us a table straight away. I LOVED the ambiance, it small, quaint, romantic, and comfortable, I loved the candles on every table. I was smitten. I felt like I was in Italy too with the swanky Italian owner speaking to everyone in his sexy Italian accent and his gregarious personality. Excellent hospitality. Loved it. We started with the the fried squash blossom with mozzarella and basil. Lightly fried and bursting with flavor, the dish comes 2 per plate. I then had the pan seared scallops in sunchocke puree. OMG can I have 5 of these dishes? WOW. I believe 3 scallops came on the dish, lightly seared and the light sauce paired so perfectly with the scallops. For dinner I had the potato gnocci in a traditional Piedmont cheese with walnuts. I appreciated how they gave European portions because I could have easily eaten 100 of these and gained 20 pounds. The gnocci just melted in my mouth and the cheese sauce with walnuts...so outstanding that I need to go back and get more, excellent dish.For desert, they make Nutella espresso. Yes, you read that correctly. Espresso brewed with Nutella. It's like the skies lifted, this drink was so good. We had to have two each and luckily my boyfriend cut me off or I wold have had 5.I can't wait to go back with my boyfriend and my best friend.

I loved the marinated peppers, the vitello tonnato, and the scallops.  The pastas were all delicious -  the Tajarin (house-made angel hair pasta with chanterelles and veal ragu) is excellent and the gnocchi alla bava, was also a standout.  My friend had the gluten-free pasta and I couldn't believe it was actually gluten-free, it was that good.  We shared the bone-in veal Milanese - one of the best I've had in NY and a fish of the day, also very good.  My other friend is vegetarian and had the ratatouille which was surprisingly delicious dish and also good as a starter or a vegetarian side.  We had the Zabaione (a classic Piedmontese dessert), the Bonet and the Sbrisolona (a crumbly cookie / tart) served with coffee cream!
