5.0,1/4/2019,"This is a sad day that Union Square's iconic restaurant is no more. I have been coming here for a decade. The food is devine and the ambiance is inviting and very classy. Upstairs is the dining area and downstairs is a jazz bar with live music. From apps to cocktails to entres and dessert, everything I've ever eaten here was amazing.  I guess if you need dinner in Union Square now you'll have to go to McDonalds or Chipotle.",3,0,0,Kami S.,"Brooklyn, NY",191,186,428

3.0,12/19/2018,"Went for brunch with a group of 6 on Sunday at 10:30. The food was delicious but the service was lacking big time. The waitress was spaced out and barely checked on us at all. We had no spoons and despite asking for spoons, none ever appeared. We also asked for milk and sugar for coffee--the milk took way too long (coffee wasn't hot anymore) and the sugar never came. Very odd. The restaurant was not crowded and the waitress was definitely not busy. We were seated upstairs, which was beautiful, but overall experience was disappointing due to underwhelming basic effort.",0,0,0,H D.,"Fort Greene, Brooklyn, NY",2,8,3
1.0,12/16/2018,I usually do not write reviews but feel I must    I sat at a very crowded bar on a Friday afternoon.    The bartender dropped menu off n ran away.   After a drink I ordered a cold seafood salad.  I specifically asked if this was just sea food which it usually is.  He said yes.    I was shocked when it came.  No bread. And filled with some type of mayo  thing.   There were two shrimps n it  was truly horrible.   I told the bartender who said n did nothing but take it away.   This horror was 29 dollars.  I paid the bill n gave the bartender 10 tip.  Not even a thank you.   Will never go again.   I do not recommend this place.  Rude rude rude,0,0,0,Helene V.,"Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",9,3,0

3.0,12/13/2018,"My long time NYC friends were meeting for our biannual girls dinner. BWG was chosen for its selection of seafood and meat, and also we like to go alittle fancy when we get together.BWG has been around for a while and I have always wanted to try it. But alas, I think it has lost its luster.The restaurant still has a pretty glow. The bar was lively and golden. We were seated at a booth on the mezzanine. We were all comfortable. Our server David was attentive and pleasant.That all being said, the food left so much to be desired, especially for the price.We started with 4 different apps not one stood out. I was really disappointed in the ""lobster rolls""... mostly bread and mayonnaise. One of my friends ordered the scallop entree for $$$ 2 scallops!!!I had the swordfish...it was ok.Another friend ordered the branzini and left most of it because it was too salty.Dessert...meh.

The charred brussel sprout and kale salad with their fresh bread was the perfect gateway meal. The scallops and pork belly are a must - rich, silky fat with a little chase of the ocean. Equally as silky are the cheesy orecchiette resting on a slice of roasted winter squash with sweet sausage and the bite of bitter broccoli rabe. The food was just as magical as their interior and every person seated around us looked like they were celebrating life!",1,1,1,Julia F.,"Brooklyn, NY",122,200,62
3.0,11/23/2018,"I am writing to complain about how our seating was handled  for Thanksgiving dinner.  We were seated in the rear of the restaurant at a small round table, the people at the next table were getting ready to leave and we asked if we could switch to their table which was larger (there were only two people at their table).  We were told that we would be seated there as soon as they left and if we wanted to order something to drink while we waited.  We did order and after a few minutes someone from your staff came to our table and told us that we could not change tables because that one was reserved.  We asked if he had another table that was a little larger than the one we were at and he seated us at at a table near the steps in the middle of the restaurant.  The table was wedged into the corner of the wall and window and two people could not sit comfortably at it.  One of us was on the grating and the chair was not stable. There were many parties of two sitting at larger tables  so we were not asking for anything special.  I made a reservation very early on and expected to have a decent place to sit.

Bartenders had a good wrist mixing our martinis, and this time we had started with the East and West Coast Oysters (everyone seemed to enjoy West Coast the best), and dined on the Whole Snapper with Mango Salsa, which was superb, as well as the Lobster Ravioli and Black Bass.

3.0,10/22/2018,"(My review is in response to the recent menu change. Before the change I gave BWG 5 stars, this change has forced me to reevaluate my score to 3 stars. ) The Blue Water Grill use to be my absolute favorite brunch spot in the East Village. Beautiful atmosphere, brunch reservations, delicious menu and come weekends complimentary cocktails, coffee AND pastries all locally sourced. However, recently the restaurant has changed their menu in response to a competing restaurant shutting down- Coffee Shop. According to my waiter, Blue Water Grill has decided to change some of their menu items in an effort to absorb Coffee Shop's previous customers. But in doing so Blue Water Grill has diluted some of my favorite menu items; stripping them of all the things that made BWG special. I order the same brunch item every weekend- Eggs Benedict. Eggs Benedict is a staple in the brunch community and Blue Water Grill's rendition was not like any competing restaurant I know. For $20 you got 2 beautifully poached eggs served over a bed of thick pork belly bacon and 2 freshly baked buttery biscuits. And instead of regular diced potatoes you got a slice of this amazing potato pie! Memorable and an excellent deal. I use to look forward to my Sundays at the BWG. However, with the menu change, BWG's Eggs Benedict recipe has downgraded from freshly baked buttery biscuits to basic english muffins, from thick pork belly to canadian bacon, and from a potato pie to potato wedges. Hardly an original dish and hardly worth $20- (Yup, the ingredients got cheaper but the price stayed the same!) To be fare, this is exactly the type of eggs benedict I would expect Coffee Shop to serve, which is why I never ate there. I hated Coffee Shop. I found their food to be bland, boring, and over priced. So disappointed BWG. I hope you do not make any more cuts. I can only speak on behalf of myself, but I can tell you in your efforts to gain new customers you have lost a loyal one.",2,0,0,Elizabeth B.,"New York, NY",177,4,1

4.0,9/20/2018,I found this restaurant on a whim. I was going out on a date. We were going to Bar 10 I believe that's the name of the place. It was crazy packed. We pulled out our phones and Yelped near by restaurants. We found Blue Water Grill.  It wasn't quite dinner time yet so it was cozy quite very very nice establishment. I had the Lobster roll.

2.0,8/28/2018,"So I have been here a number of times, each one hoping this is the time the price is worth the quality, but it just never is. It is on the pricier side, I get that it is in Union Square and I would not mind paying those prices IF it matched with the quality and flavors of the food. The sushi here is terrible, definitely not fresh, and more expensive than local Japanese restaurants in the area. Their lobster bisque is OK, but as with everything on this menu, not worth the price. Their wine is also expensive; they do not have any 'more affordable' options. I have given up on this restaurant. There are so many better ones in the city and this one just falls very short each and every time.",1,0,0,Ariah D.,"New York, NY",164,23,6

2.0,8/26/2018,"It pains me to write this negative review, as I've been going to this restaurant for over 20 years and even had my wedding reception there.  The food is still very good, but the restaurant is swarming with what I believe to be fruit flies or gnats.  1 month ago I went there with my wife and father and we sat upstairs.  In the course of our meal, we killed 4 of them and saw another group of diners shooing them away.  I notified our waitress and the hostess, and assumed something would be done to rectify the situation.  Last night we went back, sat on the main floor, and once again the tiny insects arrived with our cocktails and stayed for the duration of the meal.  When we complained, we were told the restaurant was aware of it, and it was due to the doors to the balcony being open.  As though this was a normal occurrence with open air dining.  Bullshit.  In all my years I've never encountered a situation like this, and plenty of restaurants have open doors and windows.  Whoever manages this place is completely incompetent.  It's no wonder that the restaurant was empty on a Saturday night.  I predict they're out of business within a year.",0,0,0,Bill M.,"New York, NY",0,16,1
2.0,8/25/2018,"I see all the reviews for much higher ratings, but we were very disappointed.  We went to the bar for a quick drink and bite, around 5pm.  It wasn't full or busy, and we sat right at the bar, but the bartender didn't seem to notice us for at least 10 minutes.  Ok, drinks were good.  Oysters came in a timely manner.  But the other appetizers had not arrived after another 45 minutes.  During the whole time, our bartender ignored us, and she even spent time just chatting with the other bartender, who finally came over.   We inquired about our food, and was told 2 minutes, so we asked to have them to go, and wanted to pay the check.  Paid the check, and after another 15 minutes, the food arrived.   When we got home, we saw the incredibly tiny portion of the beet salad - almost laughable except that we had paid $15 for less than one whole beet, poorly presented.  Nope, Blue Water Grill is off my list for good.  Too bad - great decor and location, but not worth the feeling that we were just not important to them, especially to the female bartender.",1,0,0,Mary R.,"Carlsbad, CA",0,2,0

4.0,8/3/2018,"Came here for the restaurant week menu with a girl friend  on a Friday evening.  Booked the table at 6:15, got seated promptly when I arrived. The decor was a little on the traditional side - high ceiling and with the bright ceiling lights, it feels comfy with the sofa type of booth seating I got a table at.  So we decided to try the restaurant week menu along with some oysters. We got both the east coast, from montaulk, and the west coast from Washington, the Gigacup, they were fresh to my taste.  I had the sushi roll for the appetizer from the restaurant week menu and my friend got the walnut salad. They are not super delicious to my standard but we didn't expect much- simply because we were both starving. And the entree- we decided to try out the mussels and the branzino - they were both beyond our expectations! Mussels were fresh and the branzino was yummy as well. I especially like the sauce that comes w the branzino- it's very special with a tint of sweet and sour but you can't tell where the sour came from. And I like the bucatini as tender and it is a perfect match with the slightly spicy tomato sauce- they used fresh tomato in the sauce so we both were not disappointed with our dishes. One thing we were not particularly fond of , though, was that there was a fly , or may be a mosquito ?, flying over us almost half the time we were there dining. While certainly because of the spacious dining room, we didn't feel like being bugged, it's still unpleasant talking about the overall dining  experience.",0,0,0,Cindy C.,"New York, NY",9,35,23

3.0,7/25/2018,"I've been here several times and had I posted a review, it would have been 4 or 5 stars. I went for lunch and ordered off the Restaurant Week menu (I've been here before for Restaurant Week). This is the first time we didn't get bread, the portions seemed smaller, the salmon was overcooked, the sushi wasn't as tasty (guess smaller portions were a blessing) and the service was indifferent.  Note to whoever plans Restaurant Week, you should bring back dessert. I realize taking dessert off the menu is new and most participating restaurants are doing likewise however, put some effort into the initial two courses, and make them larger.  Had a posted solely using my most recent visit, it would have been two stars.",0,0,0,Filbert J.,"PRINCE, NY",0,12,0

This place is incredible, the interior design is warm and comfortable and the service is top notch. Our server Sara was very friendly and took care of our every needs, even going further to explain the menu in great detail and help us narrow down our selections. The appetizers here are very good. My mom enjoyed her crudite (fresh vegetables) while my dad enjoyed his Golden Sunshine Roll (filled with lobster, salmon and avocado). My brother liked his 6 pc. oyster platter (3 west coast, 3 east coast). I ordered the ceviche trio (salmon, hamachi, fluke). It was good and the portions were nicely sized.The entrees were also very good, though one stood out in particular. Both my parents enjoyed their chirashi bowls (assorted sashimi, avocado and tamago egg on top of rice). My brother seemed to enjoy his mussels pasta fra diavolo special. We also ordered charred broccoli and crispy cauliflower as sides. We didn't realize the cauliflower was fried but my brother didn't seem to mind as he ate most of it haha. I did snag a bite and it wasn't bad.Oh yeah I'm forgetting my entree (and the reason this restaurant gets 5 stars). I ordered the seafood cobb salad and it was simply heaven on a plate. It's like a regular salad this time topped with blue crab, shrimp, mussels and more delights. I even asked for lobster on top and they delivered!!!! All the flavors and fish just mixed nicely together. The seafood was fresh and cooked to perfection. The lobster was succulent juicy and to die for!!!This was a fantastic restaurant and hopefully I'll get a chance to come back here soon.

2.0,5/21/2018,"Itoday is the second time- Blue Water Grill was a huge disappointment-First the seat we got was not remotely what I requested- a 4 Top- closest to the windowWe got a pretty table but it wasn't meant for 4 people- after having waited 20 minutes with a reservation - we elected not to wait another 30-40 minutes- perhaps the restaurant was short staffed ? Our waiter was cordial initially but clearly either he's just joined but was definitely challenged-- the deal breaker was when I asked where the birthday dessert was- he replied the kitchen is closed- I reminded him of the fact that I requested this at the beginning of dinner- reminded him twice--and told him that's unacceptable- he was snippy & obviously had mentally checked out-This was a very special dinner- planned for a very close friend and her mom- both celebrating their birthdays.I found one manager- whose name escapes me- she stated the waiter told her we said we did not want dessert-??I advised I told both hostess & waiter 2X-that we were celebrating 2 Big birthdays.She the manager, too had attitude- albeit apologized- and responded by saying - well I can start a new check & go get you dessert from kitchen - this by the way us after we had to have coffee redelivered as it was cold- and we had paid our bill.At this point I told her I was surprised -she didn't offer a birthday dessert complimentary- but with continued bad attitude she said, they /the restaurant never offers birthday dessert free, it's our policy or it's written somewhere- something very ridiculous-I said it's not about the money- it's about the lousy service, a snippy waiter- ruining a celebration and quite frankly marginally ok food- when it used to be great- and the prices remain high and quality doesn't match up.A smarter business management decision would have been to comp something - to save a celebration.We're not talking a round of drinks requested for free- and it was to little to lateEverything here is headed downhill- ever since the renovation, the food quality hasn't been the same.I loved Blue Water Grill since it's opening.I've entertained my media clients for years and celebrated many happy times- so clearly I want to champion Blue Water Grill- The staff generally great - outstanding, has gone to having attitude and uncaring.Is the lesson to be learned, not have dinner on Monday's @ Blue Water Grill or never to come hear again -Because of the many good times- the owners, I hope things are resolved- and will engage with senior management - and will not return until a conversation takes place- tonight was a mess and ruined.

3.0,4/1/2018,"This is a really great place with a fresh menu. The food is delicious and every bite packs a fresh/ real food taste. The menu is not large so the options are limited however you can't go wrong ordering anything in any season. I would have given this place 5 stars however the service is inconsistent.  Kudos to the chefs but the hostess and servers need to learn how to work with the public. The hostess at the front desk greeted my party upon arrival and once she stepped around from her hostess station she looked my friend up and down and sized her up. The hostess did not smile so we were wondering what the unprofessional eye contact was all about. The wait staff is a hit or miss. You can have a great waiter/waitress who doesn't fully engage in conversation because it gets busy however they do not mess up your order and are accommodating. You can also get a waiter just as I had Wednesday night who is rude. He was nasty with my table because we just wanted to start with appetizers and decide on the entree later. I don't see this as an issue considering there weren't many occupied tables. We place our wine and app order and he took our menus out of our hands and walked away. We thought this was done in an abrupt manner but we laughed at it because we didn't understand what just happened and why the waiter was pissed. When it was time to put in an entree we had to tell another waitress to locate our server because it seems he had given up on us. When he came back over we were tossed between two options and wanted to be guided towards the better of the two. Our waiter was not helpful.. we then asked for the ingredients in one of the entrees and he yelled them at us, one.. by.. one until we just cut him off and said thank you. In a fine dining restaurant the wait staff needs to be able to communicate with the public and sometimes it's not what's being said but how it's being said. There was another table who had issues with the wait staff as well so I know that it wasn't personal. I will be taking a break from eating here because my last experience from very u welcoming.",0,0,0,Lindsay A.,"Lido Beach, NY",122,48,1

Service was attentive, although a little affected. The food was great!  The beet ravioli with goat cheese, figs and pistachios appetizer dish was delicious, the Shakshuka flatbread entree was very good, but really should come with at least two eggs - it's shakshuka after all! Finally, the honey glazed donut french toast with nutella, bananas and hazelnuts we shared as a dessert after was inspired!

The atmosphere of the restaurant is great for a crowd and the waitress we had provided great service and that's about the only thing good at this place. The food was VERY average. We got the seafood tower and a sushi roll as an appetizer, the crab tasted like salt and sushi roll was very bland. We ordered a round of cocktail and they weren't very good either, I ordered the ""CEO NEGRONI"" and it tasted like medicine but I drank it anyway, my second order was the Mezcal Julep and that was just as bad. Our main course was just as bad, I got a fish dish in a crockpot and the fish tasted like tank water, some of the others on table weren't very satisfied with their dishes as well ( Others ordered Squid ink Pappardelle, Swordfish and  Salmon (I think) ). I really don't recommend this restaurant at all, it's great for a group but you're not going to be very satisfied when you leave especially after you consider how you feel and what the bill is.

4.0,3/25/2018,"A couple weeks ago, I walked to my favorite bakery, as I do about once a week for a snack.  Upon my arrival, I realized that the store was dark.  Yes, it had shut down suddenly overnight, much like many other great places in New York City.  Thus, my personal mantra was confirmed: if you hear rumblings that a place is shutting down, you must make it your mission to go immediately.As I stared off longingly towards the empty counters of the small bakery, I knew what I had to do.  I made reservations for that night at Blue Water Grill.As you likely know, Blue Water Grill has been in a well-publicized rent discussion, which means it might not be around forever.  I figured it was my duty to go ASAP.  I made a same-day Saturday night reservation for two and went with one of my friends.  The restaurant is magnificent inside and it is HUGE.  We were seated quickly upon arrival.  I will say that the tables are rather close together; we got lucky and were seated next to friendly people, but don't expect much privacy here.  Our server was helpful with recommendations.  We ordered:SASHIMI GRADE FLUKE WITH BLOOD ORANGE & PONZU: Fun and fresh little appetizer.  Fish was very nice; the blood orange and ponzu accents worked well.  SQUASH APPETIZER WITH YOGURT AND POMEGRANATE: I ended up with an appetizer as an entree, and this thing was huge.  Squash three ways with light and fresh toppings.  Enjoyed this.  BLACKENED SWORDFISH ENTREE: My friend got the swordfish and it was very nice.  Although the entrees were fairly pricy, the size was appropriate.  BANANA ICE CREAM TOWER: Everyone seemed to be getting this, so we caved.  It's just as good as it sounds.  The shell was great.All in all, we felt that the quality matched the pricing.  This was a solid meal and I would be sad to see Blue Water Grill meet the same fate as my local bakery.",6,0,4,Jenn P.,"Manhattan, NY",285,134,933

He could tell I was upset and asked me to tell him where I wanted to sit. So I pointed out another table that I liked and we were seated there.

The pasta was the only disappointing dish - it seemed overcooked. Desserts were wonderful. I'm not usually a coconut person but the cake had a nice tangy citrus flavor to it. The chocolate was absolutely decadent. Only qualm is the service. My friend was left without a spoon for her appetizer for a good 10 minutes until we saw our waiter again, despite telling a busboy. There was also one person in our party waiting for their entree while the rest received theirs.

3.0,2/7/2018,"Blue Water Grill lucked out with a great location -- Union Square -- and a great setting -- an old bank -- and it's been complacently riding that wave for 20 years.I used to go fairly regularly back when I lived in the area, but hadn't been back in years.  With the convenience factor gone, I didn't feel compelled to seek it out.Went last night with a friend who lives nearby and, if possible, the food was even more boring than I remember. My salmon was so blandly prepared that it made me wonder if the chef forgot to season it.  The fish was accompanied by a few equally tasteless vegetables. That's it. I practically fell asleep on my plate while eating it, I was so bored.My friend was equally underwhelmed by her arctic char, which was similarly prepared, if you can even call throwing a piece of fish on a grill and boiling a few vegetables preparation.The only standout was the spicy tuna roll.  It tasted just like a spicy tuna roll that you get from any sushi joint, but at least it had some flavor.If it weren't for the prices (not cheap) and portion sizes (not generous), I'd be more forgiving because the food isn't terrible.  It's just not worth the benjamins.",1,0,0,Tamara L.,"Croton-on-Hudson, NY",1,43,36

The hostesses were overwhelmed, but kept ignoring us and seating others before us. Understandably, she wanted to seat the people who were badgering her first, but they walked in after us with later reservations. Didn't want to be rude, so just accepted it and was seated about a half hour late.We sat down, and the service was equally disappointing. Bread service never arrived to the table, while we watched all other tables served bread. We finally asked for it, and the busboy prematurely tried to remove it.2 of us ordered from the restaurant week menu, which was fine, but nothing to write home about. I was surprised at the limited entree choices on the restaurant week menu. The only fish choice was trout, which seemed odd given that Blue Water is primarily a fish and seafood restaurant. While yes, there was a pasta with shrimp dish, it also had sausage, which is not feasible for people like myself who do not eat meat.The other 2 of us split a sushi roll, which was way too tiny for $20; a rice paper roll, which was fabulous; the mini lobster rolls, which were good, but again did not justify the price point for the tiny portion; and the scallops. The scallops were $38 for 3 scallops!!! When three tiny scallops came to our table (at that price) we were utterly shocked. They were good, but not $12.67 a piece good... You would have think the waitress might have given us a heads up on the portion size given we were sharing.Desserts were very mediocre. Restaurant week people had the chocolate espresso cake, and the other two split the apple pie.

4.0,2/1/2018,"Came here for Restaurant Week lunch with one other person. The staff are pretty welcoming, so that was nice. Between the two of us, we split two rolls, a soup, a short rib pasta, a fish entree and two desserts. We were stuffed with the pre-fixe! A lot of the dishes we ordered weren't on the actual menu, so I'll just stick to general things about the food. I thought the sushi was well made- the fish quality was fresh. I didn't really care for my roll, but the Lobster roll (which is on the menu!) was delicious. The two main courses we had were well made as well, a tad bit too salty. For the dessert, the waiter misheard and gave me the wrong one, but she was nowhere to be found, so I just kept with it. My guest had the sorbets - the coconut one was particularly icy and not good, but the other two were great! One thing that really annoyed me was that people would keep asking if we were finished. With our main courses, 3 people asked within minutes and it made us feel incredibly rushed. Otherwise, decent service and decent food.

The smoked trout was good but quickly became overwhelming in taste that my family couldn't finish their dishes. We figured dessert would make up for it, but while the presentation was pretty the desserts weren't all that great. The lemon Meyer cake was dry, the chocolate layer cake was great, but the gelato on the side had almost a rotten after taste. When we asked our server, she acknowledged that the peculiar taste was due to it being a sour cream gelato.

We did however see him for the rest of the night drinking wine at the bar with two other staff members. We ordered oysters. They never arrived. We told the busser. Even though we saw him tell our waiter, he still didn't bother to come over. Another waiter, Ricky, came over and 'apologized' with two glasses of champagne. He then quickly went back to the bar to continue to drink wine with Billy and another staff member. When our food came out no one checked in to see how it was. No one offered to freshen our drinks. Thank God for the busser who at least brought me salt and pepper and refilled our water. He also was the one who brought us the $300+ check. I will never be coming here again. It was $75 for my over-salted fish and the worst service I have ever experienced in my 20 years dining in NYC. We were dismissed as soon as our waiter Billy took our order.

Located in the heart of Union Square, I've spent most of my 30s attending this establishment. Naturally, when my husband wanted seafood, I recommended this place. I'm sad to report this place has fallen off significantly. We were told that it would be a 10-15 min wait for a table. Not a problem for us as we were celebrating and decided to have a cocktail at the bar. About 7 mins later, after we got our drinks, we were told that our table was ready. The hostess reminded us to pay for our drinks at the bar before moving to our table. She ""reminded us"" 3 more times, which became kind of annoying. We finally decided that we should move to our table. I then asked the bartender to ""settle up"" with a check for the two drinks we ordered at the bar. The bartender took a while to tally up a tab as we kept getting bothered that our table was ready from the hostess. Again, very annoying. My husband finally got up and left more than enough money including a sizable tip at the bar. Two seconds later the bartender was calling the manager over to send us a bill for the two drinks. We both said ""it's on the bar...we were rushed over here!""  After that, we were presented with a ""brunch menu"" at 2:30 in the afternoon that had little to no options for high quality fish. In addition the waitress brought over tap water that had something nasty floating in it. We ordered a shared Taco, that was wrapped in a cheap soft taco but had decent pieces of fish (not worth the price). Not to mention, the food was accompanied with dirty napkins. We also ordered the seafood tower which wasn't bad but again, wasn't the best we've had. The best part of this experience was the coffee. It was actually good. The dessert looked and sounded tasty but was just a box of chocolate jello pudding with Oreo cookie crumbs, a 1/2 scoop of ice cream and a piece of chocolate with decorative holes in it.

One, the food was as fresh as it could possibly be, and two, it was clear that much care went into the preparation of these dishes. The Spicy Tuna, Union SQ, and Golden Su shine Rolls were all excellent and obviously fell right into the strengths of this restaurant. Again so fresh and just right flavor-wise. Had the Harissa Spiced Swordfish SkewerAnd the Ginger Soy Msc Chilean Bass, and both were solid main courses rounding out an extremely enjoyable meal. We also got an order of Baked Orecchiette to round out this belly boosting affair, and it was pretty damn good for not being an Italian restaurant. All along the service was sharp and perfectly in sync with our table's pace for the evening. Coffee was surprisingly good good serve fresh out of a French press, which was better than a lot of our boutique coffee shops, of which there are many now. That was a spot in brew! Deserts were just what you'd expect, the Valrhona Chocolate Mousse w/ oreo crumble and the Warm Peach Pie w/sour cream gelatoWe're so good we didn't even get past the second dessert offering!

It was flavorful and not too heavy which left room for dessert. We ordered lemon blueberry pie with a side of ice cream and the chocolate mousse which had a bit of sea salt sprinkled on top.  My spouse had an Irish coffee which he enjoys after a very satisfying meal.  The building is an old bank converted to an upscale restaurant with additional rooms that can be rented for events.  During our meal we were seated upstairs and had a good view of the restaurant.  Come out for a delicious meal after visiting the sights in NYC.,0,0,0,Alicia M.,"Walkersville, MD",0,94,70

2.0,8/18/2017,"I came here last week with a friend for NYC Restaurant Week and had high hopes for this place since it was reviewed pretty highly and all their food pictures looked good. Honestly, the service was pretty horrible and deserved a 1 star and the food was also just okay, 2 or 3 stars top. I don't know if the dishes were not as good because it was part of the Restaurant Week menu, but to say one of the highlights of the food was the free warm bread that came out first, is pretty bad. The server, our waitress was very inattentive, slow, and not very friendly. We tried waving her down multiple times and ended up getting the attention of other staff who had to let her know. My friend ordered a glass of wine, and when our waitress came by with the bottle and glass, she immediately poured the glass of wine without letting my friend try a little first. Our waters were also not refilled very often, they were left empty or almost empty a few times throughout the night. I'm not sure if this is the level of service this restaurant has overall, or this person was just very poorly trained. Either way, a change needs to happen asap. At the end of the meal when when she came to give us our bill, literally not a single word, she just came and left the bill and walked away. Not a single ""thank you"" or ""have a nice night."" It was pretty shocking, I don't remember the last time I had such terrible service at a restaurant. Now onto the food. For the appetizers we ordered the salmon roll and the watermelon arugula salad. The salmon roll was pretty good, but the sauce that came on it we felt was a little on the sweet side. The watermelon arugula salad was pretty good and very refreshing, it was a pretty big portion too! For entrees, I ordered the mussels and my friend got the chicken dish. My mussels were pretty disappointing because first off, there was barely any broth in the bowl so I tried to mix everything around to make sure everything was flavored. The mussels themselves were also very small. My friend's half chicken wasn't bad, it was actually flavorful and juicy, but the side of grits/mash potatoes (not sure exactly what it was) was not very good. I don't exactly remember what dessert dishes we picked but they were decent (I think it's hard to mess up dessert) both were pretty good, a little on the rich side so we just picked at it.Overall, I don't think think I would come back because of the horrible service and sub-par food.",0,0,0,Sarah C.,"Seattle, WA",232,132,1148

4.0,8/10/2017,"I wish I could give this place a complete 5/5. But sitting on the second floor at a corner table, we all left drenched in sweat because it was so hot. We asked about air conditioning and making it cooler, but things just seemed to get hotter as the evening went on.However, the food was absolutely fantastic. Like, completely on point. Some of the most well done dishes I've had in a while. My mother-in-law ordered the Watermelon Feta Salad. The way it was presented was beautiful - one large, full, circular slice of melon with all the other ingredients in top. She shared a wedge. I found the tomatoes to be the most flavorful tomatoes I've ever had in my entire life. Where did they get them??My mom and I shared the Tempura Cauliflower. It was nice, but couldn't really compare to that salad. And the ""tahini sauce"" it came with didn't taste very much of tahini. However, my entree and dessert were back to being awesome. I know it's a seafood restaurant, but I opted for chicken. Again, this was some of the best and most flavorful roasted chicken I've ever had. I don't think it's unusual to find a place that's capable of juicy, tender chicken. But I feel like actually seasoning that chicken appropriately never happens. For dessert I tried the Tower - A thin layer of Brittle rolled into the shape of a towers, filled with vanilla ice cream and banana slices, sitting in a pool of marshmallow fluff and drizzled with chocolate sauce. The bananas were perfectly ripe and and the Brittle had this great chew to it (it didn't break my teeth!). And, of course, I loved the marshmallow and chocolate.

1.0,6/24/2017,"What a sad and abrupt ending to a long term relationship.  We've been regular customers at Blue Water Grill since their 1996 opening (and to Metropolis which was there beforehand where I took my wife for our first date) and the location, setting, food have always left us with good memories (BWG was always on our short list of places for celebrations). In short, BWG was almost like part of our family.Unfortunately, the corporate brush off treatment we recently received was just so over the top that we would sadly advise staying away. On 4/14, we reserved a Sunday dinner table for a large party for an early Mother's Day dinner on 4/30 and I received an email confirmation. On 4/19, I abruptly received an email saying I had cancelled my reservation (really???). I called back immediately and the hostess told me someone at the restaurant accidentally cancelled my reservation but she was reconfirming me again and I received a second email saying my reservation was confirmed.  But within half an hour, I receive another email notifying me I had cancelled the reservation again(!!).  The restaurant manager (Stevey) eventually followed up by saying he was cancelling my reservation due to a corporate event (my interpretation - we decided to kick you out even though you reserved ahead of time because BWG lucked out with a last minute private event which can make us so much more money, your multiple confirmed reservations are worthless, and being one of the restaurant's longest regular customers pales in the face of corporate greed).  After a series of emails, he offered to ""help"" secure a reservation multiple neighborhoods away at sister restaurant Atlantic Grill in the Upper East Side (I have elderly parents so thanks but no thanks). He claimed to be sorry but the canned apology and explanation were so empty that it just compounded the negative feedback loop (how do you begin to explain sending multiple robo-cancellation emails and multiple confirmed reservations?!).So I've waited 2 months before writing this review, giving BR Guest and Blue Water Grill more than enough time to figure out how NOT to treat their customers and it's been complete radio silence. So my only advice is don't book any important events unless you're willing to buy out the entire restaurant for the night.  Apparently being even one of BWG's longest standing customers is only worth the courtesy of rebooking from Union Square to Upper East Side. And the welcoming ""B R Guest"" slogan clearly only applies to corporates.  What a sad ending to what was a ""go to"" place for us for over 20 years.",0,0,0,Walter W.,"New York, NY",0,2,0

Started with the Lobster Rolls, almost all bread with a small bit of lobster meat that was heavily mixed will filler and mayonnaise.Next up - Cauliflower - tasty, but deep fried,  nothing exceptional.2 sushi rolls - nothing special at all about them, fine, but for the price, I would have expected fresher tasting fish and/or a really special combination of flavors.Had the fish for 2 special, Striped Bass, stuffed with crab meat, prepared tempura style.  I knew it would be fried, but not as heavily breaded and deep fried - waitress described it as a bit lighter than it was.  Nothing wrong with it - a decent amount of crab meat stuffing, but for $76, I would have expected something more special.Asparagus - a few spears, mixed with an asparagus moose, just didn't like it, the textures did not (in my opinion) blend well.Nice waitress, but she seemed a bit overworked, and we waited too long for cocktails and wine, and to place our order.  The wine she recommended on the ""sommeliers list"" was out, so we ordered a different bottle. My wife's cosmopolitan was served in the smallest martini glass I've seen.Nice looking space, a good overall atmosphere, although the bench seat of our table was well worn.Bottom line, for the price, I won't be rushing back anytime soon.  I've had better food at half the price in many other restaurants.  Just nothing compelling about the experience and food.",2,0,0,Steven M.,"Baltimore, MD",0,10,3

I went here during restaurant week (yes I know, this review is a long time a-comin' but I've been busy!) and met a friend who was willing to help feed the foodie in me. We had a reservation for 7:45 PM, but were seated closer to 8:00 PM due to the sheer volume of people in the restaurant. For a $$$ restaurant, it was packed! Probably everyone taking advantage of restaurant week.. My friend and I were definitely on the younger end of the spectrum of diners in the restaurant, so we definitely felt out of place but our server was peppy and smiley and we instantly felt more at ease. I went with the oyster bisque to start, rock shrimp pasta as entrée and chocolate cake while he went with the salmon cucumber brown rice roll to start, smoked trout as entrée and the chocolate cake as well. We ALMOST got a bottle of wine and happy hour oysters too but figured we'd be full enough as it is. They brought out this heavenly bread roll with whipped butter that was so so so soft, and the warm butter spread seemed freshly churned and paired so well with that bread.. We asked for seconds! Our appetizers were brought out not too long after - my oyster bisque was very fresh, a little heavy on the sodium for my tastes but still well done. My friend's salmon roll was interesting, not sure how I feel about brown rice rolls because the rice gets super glutinous super quickly if not eaten immediately. Fish was fresh, though. Our entrees took a bit longer to come out, but I loved my pasta (read: rock shrimp is one of my favorites so they literally couldn't do anything to make me unhappy with this) and paired nicely with the marinara sauce. Pasta was cooked al dente, and texture was perfect with the shrimp. Friend liked his trout, it was SUPER smoky (like the smell of a bonfire in your mouth) but still tender and sweet. The dessert, let me tell you... that chocolate cake is to die for! Not a fan of the marshmallow puddle, but the vanilla ice cream and 3 layer chocolate cake combination was otherworldly.

The short rib rice bowl was a generous helping and cooked to perfection. I thoroughly enjoyed the blackened swordfish. It was layered with flavor. I couldn't get enough. We also had the charred broccoli and smoked mushrooms (loved the smokey flavor). In addition we had a sushi roll and a couple other items. Everything was wonderful! The seafood was so fresh.

Tonight was my first time back since they renovated last fall (and apparently also hired a new chef) and everything was thoroughly disappointing. The renovation itself leaves much to be desired, but more importantly, the food isn't nearly as good as it once was, and the service is an absolute mess. Took us 15 minutes to get glasses of water and menus on the table, and a half an hour to get our cocktails.

1.0,2/11/2017,My husband and I just came here tonight for an early Valentines dinner and I am so disappointed. I have no clue how all these good reviews are on here. The tables were so crammed up next to each other that literally the waiter had to pull the table out to let me in bc there isn't even space to walk between without doing some Tetris rearrangement. I was literally elbows length away from the next table. Also the food was just disgusting. Maybe we just ordered the wrong stuff but we had the lobster Milanese and a sashimi bowl. We never got the bread and butter which I did notice some other tables did receive. Service was so incredibly slow. Took forever to receive both apps and entree. Waiter never came to check on us after we got our food. When you are paying $30+ per entree you expect a certain level of service. Also it's incredibly dark upstairs.

I'll start up front with the NOT SO GOOD to get it out the way. 1. My waitress Katie P. was sweet but extremely slow and unattentive 2. The bathroom didn't have tissue it only contained a box of Kleenex on the floor3. I checked my coat and umbrella upon me asking, the hostess didn't offer it for me upon check in. However the couple that checked in after me was offered coat check which was odd. The manager Jon came and provided an amazing smile and asked if I needed any help, he ended up checking my coat and umbrella.My umbrella was also missing when I went to pick up my things it took some time to be located.

However the manager Jon came to save the day again.The GOODThe venue itself had such a welcoming ambiance, from the decor to the lighting. The food was amazingly fresh from the aroma to the flavor.

I decided to stay with the restaurant week menu so I could try more for less.Starter: Salmon RollSalmon was fresh, the ginger was full of flavor and the cucumbers inside the roll were perfectly crunchy.Main Course: Lightly smoked Brook TroutThis dish was awesome the watermelon radish, horseradish and creme fraiche were perfect compliments to this flavorful fishDessert: S'mores Chocolate TorteThis flour-less chocolate cake was so awesome with the toasted marshmallow on the side with some great gelato on the side with graham cracker crust.I opted for prosseco and Saint Germaine for my beverage and still water.All in all a great meal and I will return in the near future alongside my husband.",7,2,5,Bianka M.,"Charlotte, NC",329,529,2592

The roll was standard, very buttery and rich. The lobster and shrimp mix, however were a little bit watery making it very messy to eat and it didn't help that it sat on a long piece of lettuce and then on the roll. So, as you bite into it the excess liquid spills everywhere. It really does not need to be so watery. Juicy is good, not watery. It was tasted good, though. We also had the Golden Sunshine sushi roll as an appetizer and wow, that was one of the best sushi rolls I've ever had. It has lobster and salmon in it, was so soft and full of flavors; it just melts in your mouth. You shouldn't even eat it with soy sauce, to be able to enjoy all the flavors in its own.

3.0,12/26/2016,"We have eaten at Blue Water Grill every year in December for the last 12 years. We go every year as the place has always offered a festive holiday ambiance, good food at a relatively (NYC) good price, a children's menu for picky kids, and wonderful booths upstairs to fit our party of 6. The restaurant recently underwent some expensive renovations although other than a change in the lighting in the ceiling and a new wall papered space on the first floor I was hard pressed to see where the money went. Also, it seemed to me that the restaurant was less decked out for the holidays than it has in past years. A pleasant surprise for us was the same lovely waitress we had last year serve us again this year. She remembered our group and many details of our last visit even down to my son's root beer order. That was amazing and made us feel that much more welcomed. A dramatic menu retooling was also instituted with the renovations. To my eye there were less interesting offerings for higher prices. Kids menu remains intact. My wife ordered the sea food salad and had to send it back because it was awful. The omelet to replace it was passable but certainly not worth the price of admission. My short rice bowl was fine but certainly not anything to rave about. Kiddy french fries were large roasted potato spears, a major disappointment for them. Overall the food was not what it has been in the past and definitely not worth the increased fare. For the first time in all the years we were disappointed with our meals. A company that owns low end restaurant chains has now purchased The Blue Water Grill. No telling what changes are ahead as the deal was just inked in the last month or so. We hope not to see what was once such a wonderful place become an Olive Garden. I am uncertain about whether we will return next December.

As for the oysters, I had to try it even though I had so many the day before. I got the Gigacup and shigoku oyster; and liked the gigacup oyster more. The oysters didn't taste that fresh to me and made me not feel well for the next couple of days. I think it was the oysters since that was the only thing that my friend didn't eat that I ate. The smoked mushrooms in paper had a lot of spices in it and tasted pretty good, but it isn't something that is really easy to share. The Day Boat Scallop Grenobloise tasted pretty good with the thin slice of brioche. However, I would prefer the Blackened Swordfish. The fish was cooked nicely and not dry. As for the desserts, the banana ice cream tower had a wonderful appearance. The marshmallow isn't actually toasted, but melted on the plate. I would say the best part of this dessert is the hazelnut shell.

All the veggies are prepared creatively and taste fresh and flavorful! The best bites actually were the veggies and the ingredient of the evening, winter squash!For each set of dishes that arrived at the table, I listed above in order of favorite from ok to delish!!! The smoked mushrooms were prepared uniquely and effectively in parchment paper. Mushrooms and butter - fresh, simple and tasty!The crispy cauliflower reminded me of fried calamari. Nice vegetarian alternative for a playful snack. Tahini dip tasty as well almost like an aioli. The pastas were all very good!! Even the spaghetti squash which might be too cheesy for some I thought the pairing was interesting with squash; the balance with black pepper worked.Unfortunately the seafood entrees left much to be improved. The swordfish was quite tough and sauce was too tangy/almost reminded me of A1 sauce. Nonetheless didn't seem right.. although the shrimp that accompanied the dish tasted fine. Sweet potato and braised greens were yum!The salmon, sadly, was over cooked and rather dry.The cod was the best entree.. not just relative to the other entrees but on its own- the eggplant was in purée form, smoky and delicious. The mushroom added a nice flavor and flaky texture as well to the very tender cod.Julian our waiter and Rasheed the GM were very generous and hospitable / received detailed descriptions of dishes, ingredients, and recommended dishes.

We had a set menu we could choose from m. Check the pic for the menu we got. But out of it, I got the spicy tuna roll (appetizer), the salmon (entree) and gelato & sorbet (chef's selection - for the dessert).Spicy tuna roll was the average roll you would get. It was meaty so that was a plus but not spicy. But overall, it was a good roll and you won't be disappointed. Salmon entree was pretty good! Nicely cooked and flavored. Comes with heirloom tomatoes which are a nice touch as well. The dish is nothing fancy but I think the simplicity makes it nice.I ordered the gelato & sorbet for dessert but...I'm pretty sure it was ice cream. The three flavors were: vanilla, banana and cinnamon. They were all delicious and I would recommend it. BUT maybe they were gelato and it was just super cold and hard but def no sorbet in the mix. So maybe ask before you order it just to make sure what the chef selection is for the night. For a presentation dinner, I think the service was fine. It seems like others were complaining but it's nothing to scream about. The servers were sweet and accommodative so I liked them.

We were the only table who didn't get bread with our brunch5. Since when is rail vodka more expensive than rail bourbon that you can't do a simple swap I do not recommend, it is over priced for subpar food, service and a terrible experience. That's a bad recipe for a very competitive landscape of restaurants in Manhattan.

4.0,10/23/2016,"Re-opened after 2 months for renovation, the new and improved looks suits it well. Best part of the meal was the seafood cobb salad.  I would never have considered this as my entree, but I saw a single photo of the dish here on Yelp and that sealed the deal.  Chilled, marinated seafood, each with it's own special preparation, then distributed in little piles here and there in the salad.  The salad was made of a little romaine, 5 or 6 peeled (!) cherry tomatoes, and some grilled avocado.  The seafood was Octopus, Seppia (cuttlefish), mussel meat, lots of blue lump crab, salmon, and shrimp. Rate it a 9.5.  Other dishes were a double order of sushi, which was good but not worth $19 for 4 pieces. (8 in my case for $38) My wife had the hamachi crab apple & mango maki roll (better than it sounds, not much fruit) and the scallop grenobloise  entree, which she loved.  Great service, and wine.",0,0,0,Jose C.,"Bethel, CT",0,25,0

5.0,10/19/2016,"I am still dreaming about the Day Boat Scallops from Blue Water. These sea scallops are gigantic and absolutely fresh - as they have never been frozen. The scallops were gently seared in brown butter with a thin layer of brioche on top. The first taste of that crispy butter followed by the delicate and tender scallop was explosive that I almost saw fireworks! Even more surprisingly, a squeeze of lemon on the butter rendered the dish light. The dish became even more perfect by the salty capers and the meaty cremini mushrooms (or were they shiitake mushrooms? I was hallucinating by that point). Give me endless bowls of this, and I would be the happiest person on earth.I also tried the Warm Gala Apple Crisp. The cinnamon gelato was quite interesting, but two notches too cinnamon-y, as it overpowered the gelato itself and bled into the Apple Crisp.

1.0,9/17/2016,"Went here for lunch today... I've been there a few times both in small groups and larger parties and it was never as bad as it was today. I suspect it was just our server because the food was decent. Melissa (sp) seemed new to the job since she had a helper with her handing us menus  and since we waited for 7 minutes just for water I knew we were off to a rocky start. First thing I told the server was, because we were sitting in full sun, no problem but keep our water glasses full and it won't be a problem. It was a problem keeping our glasses full though. The three of us ordered fairly simple meals, 6 oysters, two salads, a flatbread app and a taco app. 45 minutes later we were upset enough I had to get up from my table and find out why we were being ignored. Melissa tells me the kitchen just put the order though. I didn't even answer her. I walked back to my table and we were deciding on whether to stay or go when a manager appeared, apologized, bought me an app, and made sure our water glasses were refilled. It was the right thing for him to do but I was already too angry for it to matter. Our meal arrived within a couple of minutes of the manager being involved. We ate, tipped Melissa 10%, and left.

We each had a different fish for our entree. The presentation was excellent on all of our dishes. The Chilean sea bass was prepared with a ginger soy sauce that was excellent. The halibut came with a smoked eggplant caviar (this was actually very good and  much better than I expected because I'm not a big fan of eggplant). The service was very good.

If the place reminds you of the classic scene in ""The Dark Knight"" where Heath Ledger's ""Joker"" character robs a bank, you're not crazy. The place is a repurposed former bank with all the internal decor maintained. Many repurposed places -- converted warehouse lofts, for example -- look hideous, but this place is really elegant and classy.Food is nuts. I went for the calimari, which I thought was typical B-rate fried stuff you get at a gastropub, but not so. Thing was a delicacy with aoili (sp?!?!) oil on top. Added to that a Chilean sea bass with rice and lettuce on the side and a flourless chocolate cake with vanilla ice cream on the side.Why a ""4"" and not the coveted #MerlinFive? It's my patented P2P (price 2 portions ratio). There's just a little less food for dollar than I think is warranted, and this scrawny AZN with a fast metabolism was still a little hungry afterwards.

For a draft Sam Adams and my sushi roll, the bill came out to the high 20s. So, pro tip, be ready to spend!

4.0,5/9/2016,Came here on a Saturday afternoon around 7 without reservation and was seated immediately without wait. Perfect after a day of shopping :). Pretty big restaurant with the bar dead center in the middle of the restaurant. At that time I was there they had live jazz playing which was a plus and the ambience was nice and mellow. The restaurant had a nice raw bar selection. My friend and I opted for their steak which came with mashed potato and a house salad. Also their cocktails were on point. Nice mix of people and age groups within the restaurant. Next time I'm there I will definitely love to try their raw bar while enjoying a nice cocktail and listening to some mellow jazz music.

The hostess seated us right away and the waiters were always on hand to refill our wine and water. The food itself was amazing. I got the tuna ceviche and the fish was so fresh. I'm lucky I went with a vegetarian here because I got to eat the entire dish. We then had some dishes which I don't remember the names of but were delicious. We had a homemade burrata that was so creamy and smooth. It came with a avocado purée and the plating was beautiful. Lastly, we got the banana tower for good. It's a hazelnut she'll filled with bananas and ice cream and a toasted marshmallow. You have to knock down the tower to eat it and definitely a great way to end the night! I definitely want to come back and try their other dishes. It's a beautiful restaurant and somewhere nice to get when I'm feeling fancy.",2,1,2,Karrie D.,"Jersey City, NJ",136,79,265
1.0,5/1/2016,"Unfortunately it seems our once favorite restaurant must be under new ownership and/or new management. Here are 4 incidents from our meal tonight that will force us to dine elsewhere:(1) We asked for ponzu sauce with the sushi. Our server adamantly stated they do not have ponzu. We asked ""are you sure, we always get it?"" She was stern and said no. We asked someone else and of course they brought it right away. Was our server lazy or clueless?(2) We asked for bread and butter twice. After it still hasn't arrived after the appetizers, we asked our server for a third time, and her answer was ""the bus boys take care of that when they have time."" Nice!(3) We asked to substitute out rice for a vegetable and we got an entire speech about how starches cannot be substituted for vegetables under any circumstance. It doesn't cost them anything, yet they wouldn't budge. It was never like this here before. 3 for 3!(4) There was a dessert special on the price fix menu. We tried to order it, but we were told we were not entitled to it. We said we would pay anything for it. Our server said she would ask, then came back with the following response: ""the chef said she was running low and could not spare it."" Overall this led to the worst experience we've ever had at Blue Water. I'm not sure if it was just one bad waiter, an evil chef, or awful new management, but with so many choices in NYC there's no reason to give this place another chance.

It felt like I was on a cruise and made me wanna book a cruise trip :).I don't know what people mean about small portions. My husband's caesar salad app, my mussels app, my lobster entree and his yellowfin tuna entree, along with our broccoli side were all really sizable. The small thing that we ate was the rolls - I should've listened to the fellow Asian who recommended that we stay away from the ""gringo rolls."" Also the fish tacos were expensive compared to the price point but man they were tasty.We used a $100 gift card from Christmas so maybe that's why we liked this experience so much... It's easier to enjoy expensive food when you're not expecting every dollar to perform spectacular feats in your mouth. Just order the right things so you don't get mad that you overpaid for food. Some of the menu is priced fairly reasonably.I loved the vegetables that my two pound lobster was served over. Lobster too was yummy. Mussels were so meaty and the sauce was so good.

3.0,3/31/2016,"I had an up and down experience at the Blue Water Grill.  The space is pretty, but uncomfortable.  It's narrow and people were constantly squeezing and jostling in the bar area. Perhaps this can be mistaken for a happening bar scene, but it was more like not enough room.  My friend and I had a subway car like experience as we were served drinks while waiting for the table.  I got my friend's gin martini and he was served my vodka martini.  This happened as our table became available, but we let it go.  Amateur move.The seating upstairs was tight.  Five of us were put in a booth, with two of us on the aisle.  I spent the meal knocking elbows and knees with my table mates.  Other diners had to squeeze past us.  This constant feeling of being squished had a negative effect on my evening.The wine list was challenging.  It was hard to find a decent bottle of red for less than a C-note.  We had an unremarkable bottle of Bank Street Pinot Noir.  On the other hand, the food was very good.  The swordfish tacos were excellent and the tuna was really good. The toffee cake was really good, too.

We had a private room for an event and felt like rock stars. To start, the service was extremely slow and not overly accommodating, but our appetizers were great. The lobster and salmon sushi roll was a treat, as were the mini lobster rolls (highly recommend). I also tried the tuna tartare, and the devil eggs, all very tasty. The entrées fell short; out of my large group no one was impressed. I would not recommend the seafood salad as we found it bland. The desserts were also letdown, besides the chocolate chip cookies which were gooey and delicious. Overall, the experience was OK. The meal was very expensive however, so it isn't really justified.

3.0,2/19/2016,"Came here on a Saturday early evening opted to sit at a high top table at the bar rather than wait for a table. It's was about a 1/2 hour before they started their dinner menu, so they provided us with the sunrise menu, but no one chose to explain that... We legit sat there for 15minutes before the bartender realized no one had been over she flagged someone to come help us, he advices he would not be our server, and really seemed to have no interest in serving us at all. I was confused at the menu trying to figure out if it was because we were in the bar area why none of the entrees I say in the pictures were listed.. I ended up pulling up the website and figured out it was before 5... In another 10 mins the non server came back and swapped out our menus... Mind u at this point we still don't have drinks. Finally a more cheerful gentleman comes over and makes up for the lacking in the first, his energy was great, he got us drinks suggestions, we placed appetizer and entree orders. We ended up with oysters and a Union Sq sushi roll... Both were amazing. Out entrees we both opted for the blackened swordfish, I hate getting the same entree but it was the best option on the menu so and even our waiter said it was a staple at the restaurant... Well... Idk why... I didn't love it... I mean I didn't hate it either, but I mean there was nothing wow or oooooo about it, it was just a piece of fish, it wasn't seasoned well at all in my opinion, very bland, could be because I actually had to remove the fish from the entree dish because the sauce with a ""hint of heat"" made me nervous that it would have an adverse affect on my stomach so I didn't want to take any chances. Utterly disappointed with my entree and still hungry, I asked for a dessert menu. I hadn't seen the banana tower that was all over Yelp pictures, so I asked our waitress... Oh yes back up one moment... Prior to our entree coming out or waiter had informed us that waitress (forgot her name) would be taking over... I was kinda sad cause I like him, but oh well. So anyway I asked her about it, she said it wasn't on the menu they removed it a few days ago, but they still had the ingredients so they could make it, yay! So I put in an order, it came out and it was fantastic! I usually don't eat all of my dessert usually a bite or two and I'm done, but this dessert was amazing, I loved the hazelnut crust, didn't mind it getting stuck all in my teeth, lol. The bill came it was actually less than we anticipated, which was good because the service and entrees weren't up to par, the apps and dessert had stole the show. On our way out we stopped in the restroom which was down stairs which has another dining area, it's too cute with the live music, very nice, if I do come back it would be for apps and dessert downstairs with the live music.",8,8,9,Jess J.,"Cherry Hill, NJ",156,226,545

Looked amazing!In any case, I've been coming to BWG for a while now with a huge 10+ year gap in between (oh geez has it been so long already?!) My husband decided we needed to go somewhere special with no pretensions and after Valentine's to skip all the unnecessary hoohaa. I am glad we made this decision as it reignited my savory memories of the first time I stepped into BWG as a teenager. We came in 40 minutes early for an 8pm reservation because we had finished work a little earlier than intended. Got seated right away with no fuss. Loved that! Husband ordered a beer and I ordered the pisco-jito cocktail due to an affinity to mint and lemon (end up downing two of these for the night.) So yum!So the food: - We did not enjoy the fish tacos much because we like flour tortillas more than corn. We did not taste any fish in them. But we loved the slaw and the guacamole it had on the inside. Plus tacos are always fun to eat! - Mac and cheese were amazing. Holy smokes, we would swim in a big, gross tub of it all night if we could. Lol ;)- lobster bisque was meh. More like lobster purée with soggy croutons. I used a piece of bread from the bread basket to dip some of the soup and that was ""a better experience.""- halibut and blackened swordfish entrees were fantastic. Not dry and extremely savory. My husband would take the kale as his mistress if he could and he doesn't even like kale. The lump crab meat with sweet potatoes? I dislike sweet potatoes but I ate almost all of it here. Amazing at the way they prepared it. A lot of places use honey or some sort of extra sweetener to ""bring out the flavor"" when sometimes maybe they should just leave it alone and let it do its thang. BWG FTW. And who doesn't like lump crab meat?! No one. In the end we shared the flourless chocolate cake for desert because we were quite full already but had to have a chocolate desert (my preference). I always love gelato and cake combos. No brainer thumbs up here. I miss their molten chocolate desert though.Every dish does not need to be 100% for a 5 star hug.

4.0,2/16/2016,"What sold me was the Jazz room--live jazz while enjoying a delicious seafood dinner? I'm there. What disappointed me was after hyping myself up for the experience of being serenaded while feasting on a lobster, was by the time of my reservation (8:30pm), the band only played until 9:45pm, with a 20 minute break in the middle. So really I was only able to enjoy the music for 45 minutes. With the slow service here, that equates to having just finished our appetizer course. Granted it was Valentine's Day and it was a full house, but we waited around 45 mins- 1 hour between each course. Forgiving them of this, I will give credit to their fare, as everything was delicious. The blackened swordfish--which often teeters on the thin line of being overcooked and dry--was moist and cooked to perfection. The sweet potato hash with lump crab had a nice kick, and I would definitely recommend. My companion had the island salmon, which was served with bok choy and a perfect ponzu, creamy sauce. I may have stolen some of this sauce to put on my swordfish. The banana cream pie is what saved this restaurant from the 3 star--the cream, the tart, and the coconut gelato encompassed in a single bite was--in our opinion: heavenly. So much that we both wished we had ordered separate ones, instead of sharing.

There was a lot of liquid, and not much vegetables in comparison to what you would expect in an entree. My friend had the pasta dish with spicy sausage and crabs - that was delicious and quite large! There were two dessert options, which my friend and I decided to get one of each. One was a coconut rice pudding with mango sorbet, the other a chocolate torte with a chocolaty gelato - both were so good! I also asked when confirming my reservation, for them to bring out a candle in the dessert. I think they forgot at first, but made up with it by bringing a second dessert plate with a candle and two sugar cookies. The food I would give a 7.5.

The server was attentive in refilling my water (i drink a lot of water). He didnt come too often where it was annoying. And he was always right over when we needed him. The food came out at a great speed. We didnt feel rushed even after it hit 11pm. Definitely recommend people to go there. As for the food. The oysters i had were fresh and cleaned perfectly. The cocktail sauce was tasty. The scallops however i would have preferred for it to be seared on both sides. It was also a bit under seasoned. The Brussels sprouts and puree that came alone with the scallops was very flavorful. My boyfriend's pasta was a bit on the salty side. I think it's because of the sausage. Maybe leave the salt out in that dish. My chilean sea bass was delicious. Cooked properly which made it juicy, soft and flaky. A way fish is supposed to be. The dressed sushi was just eh. Nothing special. I wouldn't recommend ordering sushi here. As for the dessert (i'm not a dessert person) it was a two thumbs up!",2,0,0,Joanne K.,"Woodside, NY",392,531,1012

Yes, it was packed and noisy, but the food made up for it. The waiter was funny yet professional and he suggested a wine that made me forget all my woes. I went during restaurant week and the 3 course menu is filling and delicious. By the time I got to the chocolate torte I couldn't breathe and it was such a decadent dessert! Chocolate on chocolate...what's not to love? I had the short rib because my main course was shrimp tempura rolls. The short rib was so tender, the sauce was rich, and it definitely complimented the polenta. I have no complaints about the service. The staff was attentive considering the hordes of people that come here. I would definitely like to return to try their regular menu or even just for dessert.",0,0,0,J P.,"New York, NY",0,48,56

Had to get up to ask for a spoon that should have come with one of the dishes. Over-salted food included soup, salad, short rib, and pasta. By the time someone came to check on us, family had picked at most of their plates. If waiter had checked in on us anytime during the entrée course we cold have addressed the food quality in a timely manner. A manager came to see if we wanted plates remade.

4.0,1/17/2016,"Major ding needed for serving two fish trimmings instead of a full piece of filet on the grouper. For $30 please give the customer a real piece of fish versus trimmings. Now the review...The menu is very focused on seafood. The entire top half describes raw bar items, plus sushi, sashimi and maki rolls. There is one soup (changes daily), two salads and other small plates, plus about fifteen larger selections, again mainly seafood focused. I ordered the Mini Fish Tacos with red cabbage slaw and Hass avocado ($12.00) for my appetizer and the Brown Butter Roasted Grouper (the on-line menu states Halibut) with Szechuan peppers, wheat berry, Tuscan kale and chimichurri ($30.00) for my entrée. The three others at the table ordered the Greenmarket Salad, served with caramelized pecans, radishes, green apple, and finished with shallot vinaigrette ($13.00) and for their entrée they each order the Crispy Skin Faroe Island Salmon, with baby bok choy, tatsoi and miso yuzu emulsion ($29.00).The tacos arrived on a 6-inch square cedar plank, yes they were mini. The tortilla was whole grain with a small piece of fish, avocado, slaw, a thin slice of jalapeño pepper and a sprig of cilantro. There was great flavor in the tacos, the slaw and fish were nicely balanced and the pepper was a complement to the other ingredients. The three salads that my family ordered were large, filled with a plethora of ingredients and they agreed it was a great salad.The entrées were delicious. The wheat berry salad was blended with a vinegar based sauce, plus a bit of butter, both were delightful complements to the fish. The Tuscan kale was sautéed and was a great addition as well. The biggest drawback to the dish was the fish pieces that were chosen, they were two scraps, instead of a single larger filet. The ""fish sticks"" were irregular in shape causing areas to be perfectly cooked, while other sections were over cooked. I could not taste any of the Szechuan pepper (this may have been a good thing) and the small dollop of Chimichurri lightly covered one of my fish sticks, and its vinegar could be tasted in the wheat berry. The salmon were each a nice sized filet with the crispy skin as described and my family loved the combination of flavors.  For dessert we shared a Flourless Chocolate Layer Cake with candied kumquats and orange gelato ($11.00). It was excellent, with the addition of some chocolate crunchies throughout and the gelato was incredibly creamy, and mild in its orange flavor, allowing the cake to remain the centerpiece of the dish. Our server was very friendly, did not rush us during the ordering phase and was very efficient in receiving the orders. Unfortunately, while all of the tables around us received bread, we were never offered bread, and we needed to ask for it after our appetizers were served. More disturbing was the timing of the courses. We were barely finished with the appetizers when the entrees arrived, there was no pause between the courses, plate off, plate on, a major timing mistake by the staff and kitchen.  Overall, the evening at Blue Water was a great time with family and food. The chef combined great, complementary flavors that were delicious. I do resent the pieces of grouper the kitchen selected for my entrée, trimmings should be discarded served in a $30 dish and the lack of downtime between courses, but otherwise, Blue Water was one best evenings in several years. Would have been 5-star other than these mis-steps.",0,0,0,Jeff Jfood S.,"New Canaan, CT",21,146,181

I came here for restaurant week because they seemed to have a delicious menu set up. However I was very disappointed with the actual taste of the food. All the dishes that we had were very bland although plated beautifully but I rather it looked a little sloppy and tasted like Heaven. I do commend their service as the waiters were very attentive and helpful with the menu options.

The Calendar Island Mussels are ok. Mussels taste better with white wine sauce than red tomato sauce. The mussels don't taste super fresh but they don't taste bad either. The naan coming with the mussel tasted ordinary. They have different types of sorbet: mango, pear, and black grapes. I don't see pear sorbet or black grape sorbet often. I tried the black grape sorbet, and it tasted like it was made of 100% grape juice. It was good. In general, I like the atmosphere, the service, the seafood selection, and the taste here.

Ginger-soy lacquered Chilean Sea Bass is classic with an Asian spin, and it ties into the overarching Asian seafood theme of the restaurant. As do the sushi rolls, with super fresh fish, sometimes simply done, and sometimes adorned with monstrosities of sauce, like goat cheese or crème fraîche. There are also oysters (although you'd do better at a dedicated oyster bar) and seafood plateaus for the wealthy.Downstairs, a jazz room is bustling and lively.

The pro/con is that they possibly used fresh tuna to the point that there was a fish scale in the roll. For dinner we got the halibut and sea bass. The sea bass was cooked perfectly and tasted delicious. The halibut I thought was dry but my fiancé loved it. Dessert was ok. We got the chocolate molten cake and something Apple pie cake. The apple cake was better. There was no molten chocolate when it was cut open. The apple cake was sweet but not too sweet and great with the ice cream it came with. If you're looking for great seafood dishes, specifically fish dishes, this place is definitely recommended.",0,0,0,Ferdinand C.,"New York, NY",46,264,14

What a wonderful place! In fact, the food was so remarkable that I've looked up how to make the ginger-soy chilean sea bass because I've craved it for the last two weeks since eating at BWG. Great service, great drinks. Wonderful place. One note: I hate live music being next to me and if I had to do this over again, I'd be very sure to request a table as far from the band as possible.

We had the charred broccoli and the Lump crab meat and sweet potato hash and both were amazing. The portions were big and they were so fresh. We are then again the next day as a snack and even the leftover food of these two were still amazing. The BBQ eel was not so good. It was a bit too chewy for my taste. But the Thai Hamachi Roll was excellent. Their dishes are unique and all the flavor a that they put in the dish complements each other.

4.0,8/1/2015,"Blue Water Grill's venue is a renovated bank, complete with vaulted ceilings and marble walls. The interior is gorgeous, albeit a little dated by the chandeliers and  bathrooms (I am told renovations will be coming in January 2016). The three-floor facility is decievingly large and includes a second-story dining area, which overlooks the adjacent Union Square Park; candles line the staircase that connects the entrance to the private dining rooms in the basement. We sat in the main dining area on the ground floor, in a secluded corner - arguably one of the worst seats in the building, yet still so cozy and comfortable. Our servers were prompt and attentive; although neither of the two young men assisting our table introduced themselves by name. Between the two of them, our water was always full and our table always manicured. The team-service model combined with the somewhat noisy background makes it the type of restuarant where you don't interact too much with the staff. However, for a couple enjoying an intimate dinner, it was lovely. Our nameless servers brought bread to start. Sliced, warm sourdough and whipped unsalted butter - more of a bland palate cleanser than a bread course. My boyfriend and I ordered the blackened swordfish and beef tartare, respectively. His swordfish came with a crab and sweet potato hash. I ordered broccoli a la carte. The swordfish was thick and soft, perfectly blackened with just a hint of curry blending in from the hash (usually, I don't like curry but the flavor was very subtle and definitely added to the dish). The sweet potato hash itself was tasty, not too sweet, but light on the crab meat. The tartare came with curled potato crisps and an egg yolk. I was pleasantly surprised by the generous serving size, as it was only a small plate item. The charred broccoli was huge, well-cooked with a refreshing sour cream and lime dipping sauce. The plate was topped with pine nuts (I love pine nuts but they could have used a little toasting to match the char of the broccoli) and parmesan. Overall dinner was filling and well-executed with some really original flavors shining, but dessert is where they won our hearts and taste buds. I was tempted by the gelato, available in lavender and honey, blackberry or fig, but at my boyfriend's request we got the signature banana ice cream tower. The beautifully presented dessert featured a hazelnut shell (essentially caramelized sugar) that enveloped two perfectly portioned scoops of vanilla ice cream layered with fresh slices of banana. The whipped cream was garnished thoughtfully with chocolate flakes for color, and the scrumptious statue of sugar sat atop my all time favorite thing - a pool of toasted marshmallow. May God bless the chef who said ""this could use some marshmallow fluff."" Two meals and dessert without beverages came up to about $65, which in NYC is expected. Overall, the top-knotch food, fast service, and a stunning venue lose points primarily to the outdated bathrooms and weak bread choice (that's me at my pickiest). We will certainly be back!",1,0,0,Jamie E.,"Warminster, PA",15,62,75

Professional, courteous wait staff across the board. - Location is great. Right on Union Square, and the outdoor seating on 16th street is a pretty darn good place to be in the summer (or even in the winter, it's heated!)The Bad:- Really pricey food. A couple of glasses of wine, some raw bar appetizers, brunch main course, and a side dish, and you can quickly get to $70+ per person.

The waiter failed to advise us they were out of something until we asked when the food was served where the 2 side dishes were. We were brought food we didn't order and missing food we did order. He failed to retake drink order or we would have bought more wine. What was good: tuna entree, sushi rolls. What was bad: lobster roll (not really a roll more like a dough ball with lobster paste in it) and the pork belly which was also missing from the dough. and the guitar was so loud we couldn't talk. will not return. this place has gone downhill, used to be a favorite.

4.0,4/14/2015,"I was here recently for a private event and really enjoyed my experience, particularly the impeccable service/extraordinarily nice servers. The food did take awhile to come out, but it was very good. We each had a menu for a three course meal, with two or three options each. I really enjoyed what I ordered, especially the sauces and dish accompaniments!appetizer - octopus a la plancha. I thought this was amazingly good. The octopus wasn't the most tender or best cooked octopus I've had, but it came with a really delicious green, creamy sauce and slightly undercooked potatoes (how I like them).main - ginger soy lacquered chilean sea bass. I didn't eat a lot of this, because I was already pretty full from the appetizer, fluffy sourdough bread, and raw platter. Once again, the main attraction of the dish was good, but also not the best..what really impressed me was the perfect pairing with the sticky rice and the wasabi-flavored brown sauce. dessert - molten chocolate cake. I was really looking forward to this, so perhaps my expectations were a little too high. The center of the cake was deliciously gooey, but the sides of the cake were a little too dry. The ice cream on the side was unmemorable and not super creamy, but I still enjoyed the dessert overall.I would love to return and perhaps try the sushi next time.",1,0,0,Leslie J.,"New York, NY",30,93,270

The sangi-la (cocktail) was delicious and I had the sake plum lobster sushi roll and the chickpeas as a side dish. My friends had the sea bass and it came with bok choy and they loved it!!! We went on a Friday night so it was crowded but not jammed packed. (Reservations highly recommended) I was pleasantly surprised when our waiter sat us at a table in font of the band so we got front row seats. There are bars on both levels.

3.0,3/24/2015,"Food was decent, the service was attentive, but there were really too many weird little things wrong to endear this place to me. Dining alone on this one and all three plates at my table when I was seated had some dirt on them. The waiter was attentive and polite, but of the two specials, couldn't remember what one of them was. He also confused one of my orders and I got the wrong item. The decor is lovely, with chandeliers, floor-to-ceiling marble, copper bar, all the kind of old-school class one would expect from a spot like this, but the wire zip-tied to a vertical pipe was really out of place. The enormous rust stain on the marble countertop sink in the men's room makes me think that ownership just doesn't really care to sink more money into it anymore. Not sure how a place with waiters in white shirts and ties, jazz musicians and all the appearances of attempting to be a classy, fancy place can reconcile with something like that which has clearly taken years to get to that stage (double sink, so like 5 feet wide, and nearly all of it was rust stained). I feel bad harping on small things in what was otherwise an OK dining experience, but it was disappointing seeing all the cracks in the facade. If I'm splurging and spending $50+ on my own lunch, I kind of expect more.",0,0,0,cory b.,"Jersey City, NJ",35,251,1

It was a mix of small plate type of food that would fit a late night menu and not enough of a selection for a standard dinner. So we didn't dislike what we had but it was difficult to decide how to assemble the hodgepodge of selections for a meal that sense to us for dinner vs drinks and small appy plates. I think I would offer a different menu for late night, but who am i to know what works for this customer base. I had to only give it three stars due to the menu issue.

After being kindly greeted by and having light chit chat with the hostess, we were taken to the second level. We were paid attention to by the staff who made sure that our needs and wants were fulfilled.FOOD: not bad- Smoked Salmon Platter - perhaps it is because I am not used to buttery things, but I found the bagel to be a bit too greasy. The salmon tasted great.- Crab Cake BLT Sandwich - I did not get to taste the sandwich, but I know that my friend ate it with much enthusiasm. I got to snag one of the french fries, and it had a seasoning unfamiliar to me, which made it too salty for my taste but still strangely addictive (as I went to go grab some more from his plate).AMBIANCE: comfortable The tables were far apart so that private conversations could be held.

4.0,2/26/2015,"E-Scale: 8/10My boyfriend and I came here for restaurant week/date night Thursdays. We ordered the oyster and maki roll for appetizers. The west coast oysters were much brinier than the east coast ones. My boyfriend preferred the east coast ones more, though I think these things are subjective. The maki roll was good, it had avocado, scallions, and a fried tempura swordfish, though I'm not sure why there were the jalapeños in there ... they threw me off. For entrees, we got the strip steak and the gnocchi shrimp. I've been here a few times and never gotten the steak. I was really pleasantly surprised at how well seasoned it was. The meat was rubbed down with salt and the cilantro ""pesto"" that was garnished on the meat was a great balance. The steak also came with sweet potatoes. At first, we thought they were not quite done, but the way they were cut, I think they were suppose to be a bit ""al dente"". Again, the potatoes really worked well with the cilantro pesto sauce.For the shrimp gnocchi dish, the shrimp was fresh and well cooked, though the gnocchi was mushy. The sauce was bright green, and though not photogenic, it was fantastic. The desserts were the highlights of our dinner. We ordered both the lemon tart and the chocolate mousse cake. Both desserts were layered (cake and cream). The cake part was soft and moist while the cream part was ridiculously rich. The chocolate mousse came with a small dollop of ice cream (I wanted more!) and the fruits that came with the tart was perfectly paired. The ambiance was very intimate, but since the restaurant was crowded, noise was an issue. The service was really quick, to the point where I felt a bit rushed; however, the waiter did not hurry us out when we sat there finishing our wine after we paid.Overall, it was a wonderful night and I would definitely come back here, maybe for lunch or during an hour when it is a bit less crowded.",5,1,4,Evelyn W.,"Manhattan, NY",355,237,364

I tacked on a piece of uni off the menu, which was just OK. Somewhat dry.For our mains, we each got the red snapper with lentils and red wine mustard gastrique. The menu says ""with pickled cauliflower,"" which was a TINY morsel of a cauliflower floret set atop the fish. Humorous in a way, but I wish there was more of it! The fish was delightful, slightly dry but very delicious. Wish the piece was bigger, but alas... RW portions.Dessert was one of each - flourless chocolate torte and the lemon tarte.

The difference between salmon sushi and salmon dressed sushi was this little dab of sauce on top. The lobster mac n cheese was great. They give you a huge amount of lobster meat sitting right on top.

2.0,12/10/2014,"Great location, beautifully appointed, but food rather disappointing! Such a shame that this once highly acclaimed restaurant has deteriorated this past two years. What happened??!The only thing I can dig up is that The Blue Water Grill is part of B.R. Guest, a collection of multi-unit restaurants specializing in fine-dining brands. It seems like this establishment took a major hit with the expansion of Dos Caminos in the city (also part is the BR Guest conglomerate), which is rather apparent in their food.Overall, the food was just underwhelming. The standards have dropped so low, I'm not sure I would give this place another chance. As a former lover of the Blue Water Grill, it was absolutely devastating to wrap my mind around this downward trend! Those wonderful fresh ingredients are now just lacking the finesse and attention to detail of their once held reputation. I serious left this establishment asking myself, why do I keep returning to this place? My second bad experience; shame on me.

3.0,12/9/2014,"High quality seafood.I came here with my father for dinner and we both enjoyed our meal.  We are both big on seafood and agreed that the quality is very good, and the preparation is traditional.  The one thing that did stand out, however, is the sweet potato crabmeat hash.  A must order!  I attempted to make my own version at home but it did not come close to the restaurant version.We sat downstairs in the Jazz Room which was nice, but a bit loud.  Ask for a table further from the music to make sure that conversation is audible.  The service was a bit slow at times (drink refills took a while) but our waiter was very pleasant.",0,0,0,Emily F.,"San Francisco, CA",198,64,15
4.0,12/9/2014,"My date and I had sushi here on Thurs 12/4. We ate upstairs. It was a lively place. Not too quiet but not overly noisy. Our waiter was EXCELLENT. I can't recall his name now but my date wasn't much for sushi and he (the waiter) walked my date through everything. He explained tastes and textures and a myriad of other things that I didn't even know about sushi. The sushi itself was good. I really like sushi but quite honestly I don't know that I would ever give a sushi spot an excellent rating on it because at the end of the day it's raw fish. I don't really see how many different ways one can make it taste. I would definitely go here again and would recommend it to anyone. I'd like to also try the brunch.

4.0,12/6/2014,"OK so before I get into the food, the only reason this restaurant is not getting 5 stars is because of the seating. It was placed so close together I was basically sharing a table with two other people next to us. This would be a good place to go with a group but not for a romantic evening.Now the food. The seafood tower was out of this world and was unlike any I've had. They took the classics you would see and added some twists, for instance; the mussels had this excellent Pico de Gallo sauce on it! Now the real thing that won me over was the lobster mashed potatoes! The mashed potatoes were whipped to perfection with the right amount of cheese added, and the amount of lobster they put in it was amazing! To be honest I could have had this as my meal.

3.0,11/26/2014,Three stars for the quality of food as the oysters were uber fresh and silky. We also order the Union sushi roll and that was up to the par among other dishes as well. Service was frustrating.  We came for the happy hr but was served regular menu and then was told there's no happy hr menu. After she decided to brief us verbally the menu she left and never came back. We had to ask another waiter for our waitress only for her to come and told us she's in training so won't be available to serve us. Okayyyyy. She points to another waitress who will and after another 10 min I ask again the same waitress goes oh I thought he was to another waiter. All in all we had 4 waiter/ waitress in 1 hr that had no interest to serve a table of 3. Our friend treating was kind enough to leave a generous tip anyways but we won't be coming back to the horrible service.

3.0,11/16/2014,"Went here for an anniversary dinner with my wife. I made reservations three weeks in advance. I also called ahead, spoke with the Sommelier who suggested two wines for our dinner. He said he would come by and present both wines when we arrive.We were seated in the Jazz room downstairs, nice enough room but the pics online make it much better looking than it is. It needs to be painted and the chairs and are a bit dated. But the room. is very, very noisy. We were seated right next to each other and it was still a bit hard to hear. The band was a quartet and the vocal were so distorted and low in the mix, you couldn't hear her. We waited for about 7 minutes before our waiter came by. He asked if wanted anything to drink and I asked for the wine list. We waited and waited, but the Sommelier never showed up. So I ordered a bottle and our apps and dinner. The waiter kept asking over and over if we wanted any additional apps. The food came. We both had Chilean Sea Bass which was truly excellent. I posted a pic on Yelp so u can see. We were still waiting for the Sommelier because we had wanted a special white wine with our meal. Both he and the waiter were know where to be found. I literally had a few bites left when the waiter finally showed up asking how the food was and if we wanted a drink? Again, very late and it was waste to drink another bottle at this point. We wrapped up with a coffee and some gelato - both very good.Total cost was $223 including the wine. I was extremely disappointed in the service, especially since I called and personally spoke with the Sommelier. Wine is a huge part of dining out for us and I wanted this night for be very special. Although the food was good, the lack of attentive service, noise and disappointing ambiance made it much less special than it should have been.

5.0,8/9/2014,"I don't normally post reviews on here but after having Restaurant Week lunch at Blue Water Grill yesterday I had to leave one.I went with a group of 8 friends for the $25 prix fixe.  So keep in mind that we didn't order of the main menu, but we did look at it and it looked great and pretty well priced.For the app I had the Maki Roll of the day, which was swordfish with avacado, cucumber and some wasabi type sauce.  Delicious.  I also had a Spicy shrimp off a friend's plate, and while I'm not a huge shrimp fan it was really good, and the sauce was amazing to dip bread in.  For the meal I had the pork sandwich, which was also really delicious and a really good portion size, sometimes these Restaurant Week menu items are really small but everything we ate was just enough food, not too little but not too much either.  I didn't try any of the other main courses but friends had the trout and the crab and bacon pasta and both were a hit.For dessert, there was an addendum to the menu of 3 sorbet, which I chose.  It was a scoop each of Melon, Peach, and Raspberry.  I loved all 3, my friends didn't like the melon though so I got theirs :).  The chocolate cake was a huge hit with our table even though the waiter said not many people were ordering it -- I had a bite and it was quite good although I'm not a big chocolate eater.They also offer $25 bottles of wine, I don't know much about wine but I can't imagine it was anything crazy -- but quite a good deal and nice to pair with the prix fixe, we split the bill and all spent ~50$ after tip.  I had a mojito instead which was delicious and strong.Finally, I will say this -- this was not the best meal I've ever had in my life (that goes to Franco's of London, for all the crap England gets about its food haha).  However, it was absolutely 100% the best waiter I've ever had.  I didn't catch his name, but he was so great.  Extremely knowledgable about all the dishes and wine, but in a comical and totally not overbearing way.  Very attentive, friendly, and accomodating.  And was making small puns and quips throughout the meal that added an extra layer of fun to the meal.  Hard to describe the experience here and I fear this doesn't do him justice, but man if you are reading this just know that you totally sold me on BWG and I will definitely be back.  Oh and cool glasses.TL;DR:  Restaurant Week menu was great, regular menu looked excellent as well, great mojito, and the best waiter I've ever had.  Will be back.",0,0,0,Matt W.,"ASTORIA, NY",0,2,0

5.0,8/4/2014,"What a fantastic dinner a group of us had here on a Friday night. We arrived early for our reservations, and they were so accommodating, gave us an amazing table overlooking the entire restaurant. The Seafood here is top-notch, as was the service. If you are looking for a more hip vibe, this isn't it. This is more classic, white table cloth. That being said, we were dressed casual, and so were many others.Highlights:The Seafood Tower is not to be missed. Skip the appetizers (or don't!) and get the tower. Their preparing of the raw bar topped Balthazar's, and was perfectly fresh and the sauces and ceviches were marvelous. The Chilean Seabass with miso-soy glaze plate was better better than the sum of it's parts. It was paired perfectly with sushi rice, greens, pickled ginger and an Umami-based sauce. The Strawberry Ice Cream Tower - At one point, we decided that life would be better if food were always served in a tower-style! The Ice cream tower has fresh strawberries at the bottom, held in place by a circular tube of hazelnut-caramel goodness, and topped off with vanilla ice cream. Our drinks came a few minutes late, so the waiter comp'ed this dessert on the house, and it was an amazing gift!  Bourbon Selection - Even the most hardened Bourbon snob will be satisOur waiter - I've read a few people saying ""service was slow"" or ""waiter was new"" reviews. Our waiter was top-notch. I doubt Gordon Ramsey could find a flaw with him.  Overall, this is a classic restaurant in a very touristy area that can be counted on by locals as a go-to when guests are visiting.",1,0,0,Max R.,"Brooklyn, NY",16,33,2

Delicious cocktails, fast and professional service. We requested a big table instead of a tiny 2-seater, so we had to wait a bit to sit down. Ordered: east and west coast oysters (east were my favorite) and the deviled eggs with crabmeat to start. So tasty. For dinner - crispy skin salmon, and for dessert - warm chocolate chip cookies with a birthday candle. Overall, the food was amazing, the restaurant was beautifully decorated and the ambiance was perfect. We suspect our waiter was new, as he was extremely awkward and wasn't quick to explain the menu to us. But all the food came out in good time and everything was delicious.

I found it to be just as I remembered: a classically elegant, well-appointed space, great service, and an impressive menu. Though this event typically includes a more limited menu, I was quite pleased with my price fixe selections. These included the melon salad (so fresh and light on a sticky day), the pasta entree (modified for my vegetarian restrictions but no less flavorful) and finished with the chocolate polenta cake.

And grilled broccoli that was fine, but had little flavor from the ingredients it was featured with-citrus, parmigiano and pine nuts.Service is charming as ever. Scene is always great.

2.0,6/28/2014,I have been to blue water grill several times . I usually feel better when someone else is paying for my meal since prices tend to be on the high side here. I went last week because the person I was with wanted to try it so bad. I only half heartedly agreed because I thought with no reservation we would never get a table. But too my shock the place was empty. The service was excellent very attentive and experienced waitress. The meal of salmon was very good . The only problem is that it was $82 for a meal of fish for 2 people with no alcohol or dessert. The restaurant has a nice atmosphere and tables outside for people watching. But I won't return unless I go with someone else's expense account.This is trendy union square where I am sure rent must be very high for restaurants so they have to extort a lot from the patrons. Probably why union square cafe is moving. But will people continue to come to these over priced places? To me the really good restaurants are the small neighborhood finds that may not be trendy but they are great meals at reasonable prices. My vote for blue water is a no I won't return. A good meal and excellent service but other choices at more reasonable prices.,0,0,0,Job M.,"Manhattan, NY",0,28,0

3.0,6/17/2014,"The last time I came here was maybe a couple of years ago. But I have a valid reason and here's why: So my friend and I came here and ordered the blackened swordfish. It was THE best thing we have ever had, hands down. We enjoyed it so much we decided to go back as soon as we could. So we go back after a couple of months and we order the same entrée, super super excited to have the same orgasmic  swordfish we had the last time we came. After our food arrived and we took our usual pictures haha, we finally dug in. Um...something wasn't right. It didn't taste the same. What was wrong with it? We kept tasting it and couldn't seem to figure out what it was and why it didn't taste good AT ALL. There was an ingredient that was over powering the whole dish. So finally,  me being the pakistani that I am, figured out the sauce the fish was on was made with some sort of a curry and it was the garam masala that was too over powering. We then asked the waitress that we had no idea the dish had changed and she agreed and told us the chef had changed it. We told her we were unhappy and she was a bit rude about it. So after having our most favorite dish ever ruined by a curry sauce, we never went back. I hope the chef considers bringing back the sweet ginger beurre blanc back because it was out of this world! So I'll be giving this a 3 star because the dish WAS amazing. Would have been a 5 star if it didn't change.",1,1,1,Saleha L.,"Rosedale, NY",148,42,30

2.0,6/16/2014,"Really disappointed in Blue Water Grill's new antic.  I always liked Blue Water Grill, it was where my husband and I had our first date and we live across the Park and come quite frequently.  We love their seafood/raw towers and rolls.  We were here on Saturday and noticed for the first time in years they changed up their menu.  Not in the way we thought, which would be to add new and different dishes.  This menu change up is solely a money grab.  They changed their menu to make it like a steakhouse -  now instead of giving you any sides with your fish they make you buy them from $7 - $10 a side.  So their fish items come with these tiny pieces of fish on a huge plate.  Before they gave you a side of broccoli and potatoes, nothing special but at least you feel like you're getting a whole meal for the $30 they're charging.  Now they make you spend $40 to get the same amount of food.  Got the yellowfin tuna and was very disappointed, it wasn't a great cut of fish plus the lack of the sides really turned me off.  Not a fan, will not be having dinner here again.Try Blue Fin instead if you must go to a fish restaurant in the BR Guest family.",0,0,0,Heather B.,"Manhattan, NY",4,79,0

We shared the following:-lobster Mac and cheese -buratta on toast -soft shelled crab sushi roll-Chilean sea bass-milk and cookies dessertThe lobster Mac and cheese surprisingly has a good portion of lobster and the sauce was almost like a vodka sauce. I'm always afraid Mac and cheese is going to be too heavy but this wasn't at all. It was delicious!The burrata was accompanied by fresh tomato and basil which was tasty but I've had better burrata from the Italian delis on bleeker street. I like my burrata super creamy and this one was more like a fresh mozzarella. The sushi roll was tasty but why only 5 pieces?Chilean sea bass comes with a wasabi vinaigrette which if you're into wasabi is good for you but i stayed away from it. Otherwise it was pretty solid but small.Milk and cookies had a milk foam that was the star of the dessert. While the dessert was good, it didn't blow me away.

4.0,5/19/2014,"Housed in the former Metropolitan Bank on the perimeter of Union Square Park, Blue Water Grill is aptly considered the older, more bustling sibling to the well regarded Atlantic Grill and Ocean Grill. For years, the restaurant has been known for the quality of its seafood plates, and despite my initial reservations towards the cuisine (seafood, both cooked and raw, continues to be a work in progress) the onset of Restaurant Week was just the motivation I needed to agree to dinner here with a group of friends.On the Tuesday evening that we arrived, it took all of us a few minutes to take in the venue; the interior utilizes the original building well, as the plethora of space can accommodate over 400 guests, while the high ceilings are appropriately suited for the multitude of chandeliers. We were seated a good ten or fifteen minutes past our reservation time, however, which may be partially attributed to the fact that the restaurant appeared to be at capacity. Nonetheless, we were given a circular table on the first floor and once water glasses were filled and menus looked through, had a mostly flawless meal.To begin, I ordered the Smoky Manila Clams, a dish that included just shy of ten clams submerged in a tomato broth. While my knowledge of clams is mostly non-existent, I can say that they were plump and briney, and surprisingly tender with a hint of sweetness at the end. They were well complemented by the broth, which was elevated with the addition of smoked applewood bacon chunks, gigante beans, and a dash of chipotle pepper at the end.The entree was the dish I was the most anxious about, as all of the options that night showcased fish. With some help from the server, I finally decided on the Rainbow Trout a la Plancha, a dish which featured a gorgeous filet of trout; the skin was crisp and well-seasoned and the white meat was tender and moist, almost completely lacking the ""fishy"" taste I had been expecting. With the additions of roasted potatoes, an escabeche of onions and carrots, and a slight edge of spice from piquillo pepper aioli, it made for delicious and well-executed dish.And for dessert, how could I turn down the Lemon Berry Tart? It was a balance of tartness and sweetness, encased in a thin shortbread crust and topped with a light raspberry coulis. To finish, a spoonful of coconut sorbet and a topping of sliced raspberries, strawberries, and blueberries rounded on the dish. While perhaps more appropriate as a summer dessert, it was nonetheless a refreshing, and not too heavy way to end the meal.In hindsight, I have to say I was impressed with how Blue Water Grill handled Restaurant Week. The quality of the food was maintained, despite the volume of orders that the kitchen recieved, and our server that evening was one of the friendliest and most helpful that I've yet to encounter in any restaurant. I'd be more than happy to return, especially for the live jazz in their downstairs dining area as well as a much-lauded weekend brunch.",15,3,9,Lori L.,"New York, NY",2244,608,6827

3.0,4/28/2014,"We've been looking to try BWG for quite some time now and have heard rave reviews. We finally got a chance to come in for dinner this past weekend. We walked in on a whim, without a reservation and were seated almost immediately after we were told by the hostess that if we wanted to be seated quickly we should go downstairs where they have a live jazz band. (We would've preferred to dine upstairs but figured a jazz band would be a nice touch to the whole experience.)Once downstairs our server came to drop menus, offer us water and then left. No introduction, no greeting, no specials, just water. He came back after about 5 minutes. He then went ahead and asked for our drink order and quickly left, again. We ordered a bottle of wine which took about 20 minutes to get to the table, once there, the server seemed to be struggling to open the bottle but knew proper procedure when serving. He then asked if we wanted to order, we were ready so we ordered a few appetizers and entrees.Another 20 minutes later our appetizers arrived. Note that we had already had 2 glasses of wine and had been sitting for 45 minutes on an empty stomach. Blue Water Grill doesn't offer their guests an amuse-bouche, bread, biscuits, something extra while one waits for their order? I guess not. The Tuna Tartare was a pleasant surprise, very tasty, very fresh, excellent quality tuna. The oysters were also very fresh and tasty (we ordered West Coast oysters which are smaller but much more plump and flavorful.) The Fluke Crudo was nice and fresh except it lacked some acidity, adding a little bit of the mignonette sauce from the oysters made the fish taste so much nicer and more well balanced. It came with nuts which the server didn't mention, the menu did but with allergens servers should always take extra precautions and let their diners know. Once we were done our entrees and side came out right away, our table wasn't reset, our wine/water was not refilled, and the entrees were obviously fired too soon as one of our dishes came out cold. We had to send the cold entree back to be reheated and had to send the other entree back to be kept warm. No apologies from the server, nothing extra to make up for it and he kept the side dish on the table which got cold in the process. We were left to wait once again. Our server extended our wine bottle for the entire meal which was a bit of a disappointment as I would've wanted a different wine to go with my entree. We would've definitely ordered a second bottle had the server poured correctly. (3.5 glasses per bottle were extended to 6) No big deal, but just a tip for the server to raise his sales and in turn, his tips. Once our entrees finally came out, they were delicious. The tuna was cooked perfectly except I got served an end piece which didn't have the same vibrant red color or taste as the rest of the pieces. The noodles were amazing. The whole dish was a nice burst of Asian flavor, perfectly balanced, somewhere in there there were mushrooms because it had a nice earthiness to it. The sesame oil they used was divine. The halibut was also cooked nicely and the freshness of the fish shined through the light yet flavorful, crisp bed of romesco, endive, and bitter green salad. Despite the fact that the asparagus side was cold, it was still creamy and delicious.Afterwards, we were served our last few sips of wine and were offered the dessert menu which we gladly took since the food was so great we figured we'd give dessert a chance. Looking it over, however, we were disappointed. Fruits, cookies, and ice cream do not constitute as dessert. We ordered after dinner drinks instead. Those took unbearably long to arrive, how long does it take to pour something into a glass? It turns out their bar was not stocked and they had to go elsewhere for a bottle. The server came to give us this information about 15 minutes after ordering. Had we known sooner that it would take 20 minutes for 2 drinks to arrive, we would've asked for the check and gone someplace else for drinks and dessert. When we did ask for the check it came right away.Overall, in terms of service, the server was nice but had no personality, didn't seem to know much about service (I'm sure due to lack of experience and training). Service was therefore, a bumpy ride. We expected much more fluidity for a $150 per person tab. In terms of food, I must say, the chef does a wonderful job at balancing all the flavors in his dishes. Nothing was overly salted, nothing was overly sweet or bitter, it was all a beautiful, delicate balance of  Asian flavors. Food was amazing and that is why we are giving BWG 3 Yelp stars, unfortunately we are in no rush to return.

3.0,4/25/2014,"We always seem to book this place for Easter Brunch as its one of the few decent brunch places I know that can sit large groups of friends. This is the first time I've reviewed Bluewater Grill in the times I have eaten here and in the past I would have rated it far higher without hesitation but based on my last visit it just seems to be 'ok' nowadays.Why would I say that? Well, it seems to still have the same charm and ambience as ever (Tip: Sit downstairs if possible and catch some Jazz) but I feel the service has suffered somewhat. I seem to remember getting a free cocktail included with my brunch in the past but we are told that this ""is not served on holidays"" and will cost me an extra $10. Oh well I guess times must be hard. I also seem to remember service being with more of a smile, although easy to forgive on a busy Easter Sunday when the pressure is on I suppose. The head waiter was kind enough to offer to take a nice picture of our group.The food when it came was quite ok. The Maine Lobster and Shrimp Benedict was quite delicious and as usual there were generous baskets of bread and cakes whilst we waited for our entrees. I felt sorry for those who had ordered salads, they are not quite as substantial as I remember them here and glad I switched my order at the last minute.They have to ditch the bathroom attendant. This is one old-timey gimmick thats just run its course. I can wash my own hands and smell just fine thanks!

2.0,4/21/2014,"This is the third year that I chose Blue Water Grill in Union Square park for our annual Easter Sunday brunch.Since we're a group of 12 I usually like to make a reservation a few weeks in advance. In the past we've gone to the jazz bar which is located in the basement. The jazz musicians compensate for the view less dining area.  This time we were seated at the main dining area. (Our complete entourage waited  20 minutes to be seated) the vibe is quaint and fancy, noise level is average. It is a great setting for catching up with old friends.I was disappointed to find out that first free cocktail and coffee or tea are no longer included on their brunch menu. The Maine lobster and shrimp Benedict that I ordered was delicious. Although our food arrived 45 minutes after it was ordered. In fairness they served bread, muffins and butter while waiting for our main entree. It's one of those days where one sacrifices quality over quantity.I'm hoping that in the near future management will reinvest in training their staff regarding proper restaurant hospitality and productivity. This was once a very hospitable and friendly place, so having a  waiter that appeared very unhappy with her occupation was disheartening.The celebration, laughter and conversation with company of friends outweighed the restaurant's poor customer service.I will definitely be looking for a new venue for our annual Easter brunch next year.",9,5,7,Reggie M.,"Manhattan, NY",280,338,2975

Nice waitress, very busy though and good food.I gave it a second chance bc I had a friend visiting from the dirty south who wanted a nice bday dinner. She loves seafood and jazz...naturally I thought of Blue Water. To be honest, I came expecting a 3 star experience...MIND BLOWN!!!! Came in and they were pretty prompt with our reservation. Sat down, jazz music playing with the amazing Sarah singing and   our server comes up. Don't expect much but our server, Dane was amazing!!!!!! He went above and beyond my expectations! Honestly, of course I've been to several NY restaurants but he has to be my best waiter so far in two years!He joked with us, told us specials, his recommendations, was super patient considering it was a packed restaurant. When he found out it was my friend's bday, he came to us and asked us what cake we'd like for her (when she stepped away) and how we'd like to present it to her AND he told Sarah (the awesome jazz singer) how much we enjoyed her and she came over to hang THEN she sang Happy Birthday to my friend for her birthday (brought her to tears)!!In conclusion, food=awesome (Seems even better and more fresh/flavorful than last time. Had lobster spring rolls, scallop appetizer and my friends had fish of day and salmon). Sarah the singer= so great and sweet (which you don't have to be if you're a great singer but she did both!!) and Dane our awesome server=beyond words, above and beyond expectations and bc of his ""above and beyondness"" I will definitely be back for my next special occasion or next out of town guest visiting!!!",0,0,0,Sarah I.,"East Village, Manhattan, NY",4,8,0

3.0,3/24/2014,"I came here for Restaurant Week with a friend and didn't have much expectations. I always passed it whenever I was in the Union Square area, but never gave it much thought because it wasn't one of the more heralded restaurants in NYC. Anyhow, we decided to give it a try for RW and I came away torn. First, Blue Water Grill is a huge restaurant with multiple floors. In addition, during the Spring and Summer times, they have a nice outdoor seating area by the side of the restaurant. Of course I came during winter so I didn't experience sitting outdoors. I would have to say the decor is a bit confusing because there is old school decor in here, like the look of the booths and ceiling, but then there are parts that give it a glossy modern feel like the tables and chairs.As for the food, it was the RW menu so your expectations can't be sky high.  For appetizers we ordered the Long Island Fluke Sashimi and Naked and Baked Naked Cowboy Oysters. As you can imagine, the serving size was very small, but they were nonetheless very tasty. For our entree, we ordered the Sicilian Baked Gooseberry Cod and Tamarand Glazed Beef Short Rib. Once again, no surprise as the size of the dishes was small again. These 2 were not as memorable to me, especially the beef because there was a sweet puree that I felt just didn't mesh well. For desserts, we had the Chocolate Caramel Cake and Lemon Meringue Tart. The presentation of both on the plates were beautiful, but I've never been a fan of Lemon Meringue, however there was a streak of Blackberry Jam in the middle and scoop of Pistachio Ice Cream. Unfortunately, neither of those extra ingredients helped in neutralizing the sweetness of the tart. However, I felt the caramel cake was really good as it had a small scoop of Cinnamon Chantilly Cream placed on top. I got a bit of each together and it was reallllllly good!Blue Water Grill is a nice restaurant and I would love to come here and sit outdoors (as the interior decor doesn't wow me). The service was good, but the food on the RW menu didn't jump out at me. I'm hoping the regular menu is much more spectacular. I'd give it a another shot just because I came for RW, but for some reason I feel it wouldn't come thru on round 2.",2,1,1,Chris E.,"Brooklyn, NY",530,1118,9624
3.0,3/23/2014,"Our first visit to Blue Water Grill after hearing positive things. The food was really good. For an appetizer we had shrimp and lobster spring rolls. We ordered the blackened swordfish and lobster, both were perfect. For dessert we had Cappuccino and Vanilla Bean Creme Brulé. Unfortunately, our overall experience was poor because of the waiter serving us. I must say that we have never been treated so unprofessionally. He did not speak to us much at all when we ordered and his attitude seemed to get worse when we only ordered one appetizer. He did not ask if we wanted dessert, just dropped the menu on our table as he walked by. He did ask if we wanted another drink but when we said no thank you, he rolled his eyes and walked away. When we ordered dessert, he seemed to be annoyed that we wanted to share a creme bruléThe negative vibe this waiter displayed made this a bad experience.

We shared tuna tartar, lobster bisque, and the Mediterranean  chopped salad for starters. Then I had the blackened swordfish (a MUST!) & my husband had the branzino. For dessert we had the molten chocolate cake w/ pecan ice cream. Brian brought it out w/ a candle & 2 glasses of champagne. VERY nice touch. The atmosphere in the restaurant is very comfortable- not pretentious even though it's fine dining. The music gave a hip vibe & wasn't too loud as to overpower conversation. The only thing I would suggest is we ate @ a table by the bar & the chairs did not have a front rung to place your foot. You had to wrap your foot around the side. Otherwise, it would dangle which is awkward. Not a big deal. My husband said we should make this a regular spot for us so we can try everything on the menu. I totally agree!

3.0,3/1/2014,"I ate here last night for Restaurant Week with my parents and one of my friends. All in all, by Restaurant Week standards, it was a decent meal, but not a meal that'd be worth the full menu price.In terms of the vibe and ambiance, there's a great mood going on here. Blue Water Grill is located in an old bank and the architecture is stunning. The amount of marble along inside the restaurant is jaw dropping.In terms of how our experience went, upon walking in, we were immediately greeted by the hostesses at the main desk. After confirming our reservation, they asked if we'd like to check our coats (no). We were then taken to our table, where a server came and took orders for water and wine. The service here was actually really, really good. Our server was constantly coming around throughout our entire meal and refilling our wine and water. She was very polite, friendly and very knowledgeable about the menu. Oh, about the menu - their online Restaurant Week menu vs. the one they have in the restaurant are a bit different.In terms of food, I started off with the Smoky Manila Clams (chipotle, tomato, gigante beans, smoked applewood bacon). I was disappointed by this dish. It just kind of seemed to be thrown together. The clams didn't really have a smoky flavor and I didn't taste bacon or chipotle. The gigante beans and tomato seemed to have been combined into a pile of mush. Not literally mush as in mashed together, but the beans definitely were extra soft. Between my parents and my friend, they had the Scallop Crudo and Jumbo Lump Crab Salad appetizer. Both of those appetizers were much better than the one I had ordered.For my main course, I had the salmon. The plate came with a small cream sauce which was laced with caviar. The dish also came with red cabbage and one other item which I can't remember, because the salmon entree is only listed on their in-house RW menu. All in all tho, the salmon was a great dish. It was perfectly cooked and seasoned, in addition to not being dry. Another big plus to the entree portion of dinner was that not only did the plate itself arrive warm, but so did the utensils. The rest of our party had either the salmon or sea bass. Everyone was very happy with their entrees.For dessert, I had the chocolate mousse cake, which was decent, but nothing special. The chocolate mousee comes in between two layers of cake, which were dry. Not dry as in it'd been sitting around for days on end, but it just wasn't a very moist cake. The mousse itself also wasn't very rich. However, it was a generously sized piece of cake and it came with espresso ice cream which was very good and authentic tasting.There's also a cool scene downstairs, in the form of both another bar/loungs and dining room. The downstairs dining room also has a jazz group performing.Bathrooms are also located downstairs and the mens' room does have an attendant. I did notice that people who didn't tip him got more of a cold shoulder - he'd eventually be looking at his iPhone as he was turning the water on/off and handing you paper towels.In the end, four Restaurant Week dinners, a bottle of sparking water, a bottle of white wine, a glass of red wine, plus tax and tip came to $315. All in all, it wasn't a bad meal. $38 for dinner is a great price, but their Restaurant Week menu didn't get me too excited about their regular menu. If I had ordered a different appetizer, then I may have been inclined to give Blue Water a higher rating.",0,0,0,John-Paul P.,"Madison, NJ",68,149,839

Firstly if you are reserving a table, reserve through the website and request for the Jazz room !  There are two levels to the restaurant (downstairs being the Jazz room and the main level) The main floor is more spacious yet crowded and downstairs (the jazz room) is definitely more intimate and romantic. The jazz room is lovely with hues of red and antique phone booths right by the bathroom. Also there is a live jazz band playing, which is awesome!For starters I got the Clams- that were smoked with bacon and topped with HUGE- like the biggest kidney beans I've ever seen in my life. The dish was hearty and filling.The entree- I got the sea bass, the sauce along with the escarole and mussels were delicious, however the sea bass lacked flavor. dessert- Lemon tart, I really enjoyed the tangyness of the dish but it was nothing out of the ordinary. to be perfectly honest the food was medicore, but then again it is the restaurant week menu so it might not be the perfect representation of the food.

My dinner was delicious, the rock shrimp with cavatelli, my apple martini was good and they left the extra martini mix in a glass on our table. We paid our bill and hung around for about 15 minutes just chatting. Once we got up to leave, a man comes over to our table, who was NOT our waitress, and tells me he cannot accept my $100 bill. He tells me it does not seem right, and I asked him how I would know that THAT $100 bill was the one I gave them, after they waited all this time to bring it to my attention. He insisted it was mine and insisted I give another form of payment. Not to cause a scene, because I hate to be embarrassed, I pulled out my BANK ENVELOPE where I received the $100 bills and gave him a new one. I'M DISGUSTED THAT THIS PLACE PAWNED OFF A COUNTERFEIT $100 BILL TO ME, which I checked at my bank, Wells Fargo, and it was, indeed, counterfeit.I've heard of places passing fake money that they receive from other customers, off to other customers as change.

3.0,2/17/2014,"Came to this place for Restaurant Week Winter 2014.Large space in a very central location in the heart of Union Square. Pretty classy inside with beautiful high ceilings, large mirrors that reflect down to the dining area, and fresh roses at every table. Also has very comfortable, personal seating (didn't hear anything the next table had to say) which is something I really appreciate in NYC. Good initial impression. Staff was very friendly, offering immediately to take our coats when we got there. Our waitress was also friendly and warm. Now on the the most important part (for me anyway): The food. RW menu is a three course prefix and was pretty limited, offering  a choice of only 3 apps, 3 entrees, and 2 desserts. To start, I had a taste of a jumbo lump crab salad and clams with gigante beans and bacon. GET THE CRAB SALAD...generous lumps of crab with potato and a tasty sauce which combined will make you happy unless you are just dead inside. For entrees, had a salmon dish and a taste of a seabass with clams and chorizo dish. Salmon dish was a throw away. The seabass dish, while not greatly memorable, was definitely tasty.Desserts were a chocolate mousse cake with ice cream and a berry tart with sorbet...good.Verdict: The final star rating was a little tough for me here. Is it a 3? A 4? Aside from the crab salad, the rest of the food was so-so.

3.0,2/17/2014,"Good service, good food. Went for restaurant week with my fiancé. We got the oysters, calamari salad, trout, artic char, chocolate cake and the lemon tart. One thing I passionately recommend no one to order is the chocolate cake from the restaurant week menu. It was just so below even your average piece of cake. Not chocolatey or any flavor really, just blah. The coffee ice cream that came with it was pretty decent. The tart was much better, loads of flavor, creamy, fresh fruit, but the coconut sorbet with it was so so, not too coconutty, more gelato then sorbet. What else can I say? The calamari salad was under seasoned unless you used plenty of the mayo that was liberally available on the side of the plate. The trout was very under seasoned. The artic char was pretty good and the mushroom risotto, although lacked mushrooms, was pretty good, well seasoned. Just nothing special about this place. Nothing I tried would make me want to come back for seconds. Overall a good experience, friendly staff which never hurts. Can't give it more than 3 stars because I just didn't feel it was on the same par as a 4 or 5 star rated place.",0,0,0,Tanya Z.,"Brooklyn, NY",6,29,4
4.0,2/16/2014,"This review is specifically for the Sunday brunch. My girlfriends l meet every year in February for my friend's birthday.  Four Long Island girls, one Westchester girl. This place has become a ritual for us. The brunch menu is great with an upscale brunchy selection. None of us do the sushi which takes up a lot of the menu. Mostly crab cakes, eggs benedict, seafood Cobb salad, omelets.... Never a real complaint.  Always  good. The atmosphere is beautiful and classic. It is the perfect ""girls"" place to meet. The reason for one lost star was the waitress we had today .  She was very good, juggling  lots of requests and was on top of things.  But she did one odd thing that a person who relies on tips should never do. The brunch comes with a complimentary drink (Mimosa, Bellini or Bloody Mary) and only three of us ordered a drink with our meal to start. . My friend said she wasn't drinking and someone could have ""her"" drink. That's logical. Well when my friend asked the waitress, "" Can you bring me my friends drink, a Bloody Mary?  She doesn't want it...""  The waitress literally rolled her eyes in annoyance.  Why would she care who was drinking the drink that came with my friends meal?? I shared my potatoes, and gave a few shrimps away.  We all picked at each others plates. I'm glad she didn't see us doing that!  (Wouldn't you love to play poker with this waitress?)  We still left a nice tip. She was good  in every other way.  But not the brightest bulb when it came to making us feel like valued patrons - who should be able to switch and share their meals and beverages as they see fit.",1,0,0,Karen B.,"Bellmore, NY",0,40,7
3.0,2/16/2014,"Gorgeous restaurant. Went here for valentines day and my first impression was very good. Great vibe and good atmosphere. That gets 5 stars in my book. Beyond that everything was just ok. They had a special menu for valentines with filet Mignon topped with crab meat and Lobster that had me salivating at just the thought. After placing my order 5 mins later I was told they ran out :-( Ok fine ill just do the 16oz skirt steak. Steak was a great cut very tender and perfect medium... But it was quite salty. I had to scrape most of the rub off but the saltiness of the seasoning really took away from the flavor of the meat. There were some highlights. The service was just ok. I understand it was valentines day but the time it took to get greeted and especially the wait to get served seemed was too just too long. Not to mention they ran out of bread so the growls of my tummy drowned out the conversation at some points. There were a few highlights. The crab cake was absolutely delicious, and my girls lobster was very good as well. I just expected more.

4.0,1/20/2014,"Once a bank, now Blue Water Grill. You are greeted by grandeur marble columns and when enter, there is the comfortable two-floor and outdoor seating restaurant across Union Square Park. On the down side, the food is on the pricey side.  Thankfully, the restaurant mimics a fine dining brunch experience for their customers. (Dinner and lunch is also available, I have yet to try that.) Reservations and coat checks are also made available. I was there for brunch with my sister and family friend. We all ordered seafood variations of the classic eggs benedict. Every eggs benedict came with the perfect amount of creamy hollandaise sauce, side spring mix salad, and potatoes. The ambience definitely added more flavor to our food because we finished everything, even the ordinary potatoes. French tourists, intrigued by our satisfaction after devouring our meal, even asked what we ordered.Update: I'd have to say, the service that i experienced this time was amazing. The waiters all seem very patient and willing to help out the costumers. I went with the same crowd and ordered half a dozen cherrystone clams, crab cake BLT sandwich, fritto misto, eggs salmon benedict, and banana ice cream tower for dessert. Needless to say, this sounds like a lot of food! But we were so charmed by the service and celebratory occasion that we were there for that we had to order more! In essence of this time's food, everything was fresh and delicious. The only thing is that I avoid fried stuff. Unfortunately, I completely forgot fritto misto is calamari because I just quickly glanced at the description thinking that it was a tartare. The eggs benedict/ brunch menu has always been consistent. I would recommend it if you go to the Blue Water Grill for brunch. The crab cake BLT sandwich is a genius take of the BLT- absolutely delicious! The banana ice cream tower was a knock out!

The wretched.   They are the kind of vanilla people who come into a very friendly cocktail party and ruin the mood by putting on The Eagles.  They order swordfish even though it pee's through its' skin.  They serve BJ's pre-made frozen hors d'oeuvre's to guests in their own homes while eating their Sunday gravy out of a jar.

2.0,12/30/2013,"If you order for lunch a $14 salad and the waiter asks you ""do you want some proteins with it?"" and you reply that sounds like a good idea it should be customary to let you know that that protein will cost you an extra $33. We had a dozen oysters, 2 soup appetizers, and 2 main courses (one of them the salad mentioned above). The salad was then reduced to a small side salad (not the full portion) and they went ahead and added an entire filet mignon steak as the protein add on. My biggest issue was that I was on a business lunch (not expansible business lunch) and couldn't even really complain. Cost ended up to be $170 for a two person lunch. Very unprofessional for a place that has really good food and a great decor - First time in a very long time that I reduced the tip to 15% exactly on the pre tax bill (am generally giving 20% on post tax).",0,2,0,Thomas H.,"New York, NY",8,18,7

2.0,11/10/2013,"Unfortunately, our recent visit was a let down. I had been once, a few years ago and looked forward to returning. I finally had the chance last week when I brought my daughter to New York for a commercial audition. We had planned for lunch at Blue Water, to be followed by Belgian waffles for dessert at a nearby spot. I ordered a sushi roll filled with lobster and tuna. The first piece tasted good, but I was thrown when I bit down on something hard--cartilege, shell? I fished it out of my mouth and went on to my next piece. Same thing, but this time it was a MUCH bigger piece of something hard. at this point, the waitress must have noticed and asked if all was okay. I explained what was going on and she was horrified and said she would let the kitchen know. She returned a few minutes later and asked for the pieces of shell so that she could show the chef. Fortunately, I had not swallowed them and was able to give them to her. She returned again, apologized profusely and asked me if I would like anything else on the menu. I didn't as I was not that hungry, but more importantly, was on a time constraint. I had eaten one more of the six pieces at this point as well and the third was shell free so I thanked her for offering, but explained that we are trying to get to a special dessert spot and that I wasn't hungry for anything else. Then, she offered us complimentary desserts for the trouble. I thanked her, but reminded her that we have a reservation for waffles and that my daughter is really looking forward to that. The manager then came over and apologized and offered me other food. Again, I politely and gratefully refused the offer. When my daughter finished her hamburger, we received the check along with, yes, a complimentary dessert- creme brûlée. Did nobody hear me? Please, dessert is not necessary or WANTED. We have big plans for waffles elsewhere!! I had expected that a restaurant of this caliber  might discount the bill or not charge me for the sushi that could have cut my throat. We didn't eat the free dessert ( which had the restaurant nearly nothing ), paid our bill and left. On the way out, we had made it to the front door and discovered that our waitress was right behind us. I had mistakenly taken the wrong credit slip. I apologized,  gave her the right one and gently shared my disappointment at being charged the full price for the sushi and then trying to appease us with a dessert that we specifically declined. I also explained that this was not as much about the money as the principal. The $15 for the sushi is not going to break our bank, but I am leaving with an unpleasant taste in my mouth.  She said, that she would  let a different manager know what happened. Perhaps there is a different manager at the Blue Water Grille who would have done the right thing and he was on his a day off? We were never credited, which they could have easily done. Not sure that I would want to return again.",0,0,0,Gail S.,"Philadelphia, PA",0,5,0

In my case I got one of the specials which was a pistachio encrusted Mahi Mahi. The chef must have forgotten it was cooking because the nuts were burnt and the fish had dried out.

Then, I saw and heard her making fun of me with another waiter telling him, ""Ha, she asked if the food could be cooked........"". They both laughed. I was so pissed! I tried not to let it ruin my night but it was difficult. She obviously didn't ask the chef since my food was a tad salty. She had an attitude throughout dinner service and wasn't attentive. As far as the food goes, it was good, not great and a bit salty. There are better places in the city.

It's an old converted bank, it also offers live jazz downstairs. The place to eat is by the overhanging balconies on the side of the restaurant, it's a great spot to eat and people watch. The seafood is extremely fresh and their dishes tend to have Asians notes to each dish. The shellfish is top notch, huge oyster selection. I wouldn't get sushi here, seems kinda odd.",0,0,1,Ben L.,"Queens, NY",978,1001,2785
4.0,8/19/2013,"Lured in by restaurant week, but decided we'd rather order off of the regular menu and skip dessert (which would be the same price). The restaurant itself is quite large, with seating upstairs, outside, and downstairs. We were upstairs, close to the covered outside section which had a nice open feel. It's really the perfect place for any occasion (parents, clients, friends, date). Definitely more on the upscale side of dining, both in terms of atmosphere and price, but not overly stuffy and a safe bet. The menu is varied with raw bar options, sushi, appetizers, traditional sea food entrees, and sides - something for everyone. The service is friendly and relatively attentive given the size of the restaurant. With a menu so large, there are bound to be some winners and some losers, but we must have ordered right because we really enjoyed everything we had.Tuna tartare: a glass jar layered with avocado and tuna - great flavor, super fresh - came with 4-5 pretty wonton crackers on the side - loved this dishShrimp tacos: 3 large soft tacos, lightly battered shrimp, definitely on the spicy side, interesting flavor with the pineapple Lobster mashed potatoes: a bowl of creamy mashed potatoes, topped with chunks of lobster. simple but deliciousSeabass: i love Asian fusion flavors, especially when it involves sea food. The seabass was perfectly cooked, and the ginger soy marinade worked really given the mild taste of the fish. Came with Chinese broccoli and rice. Loved this dish - was aweome.No room for dessert but we did also enjoy a bottle of the Pinot Gris. My only other time here was 4 years ago with my dad. I remember enjoying the food quite a lot but we were downstairs and could barely hear each other over the jazz music, so pick wisely where you want to sit.",1,0,0,Nicole D.,"New York, NY",75,201,47

Not as spicy as advertised (saying this as someone who can't handle spice)EntréeChicken (me) - I should have gotten the seafood dish but I was so hungry, I wanted more food and knew whatever seafood dish was going to be much smaller. I ate most of dish (which was large with lots of chicken) but it's nothing I would order again. It kinda reminded me of banquet hall food. Salmon (bf) - This was delicious with it's lemon dressing. I definitely should have ordered this! DessertUpside down fruit cake (me) - it was alright, I finished the whole thing but it's not something I would order again.Chocolate cheesecake (bf) - Everything is better with chocolate, again should have ordered this.Obviously my bf won the ""who had a better dish?"" contest (which yes we do that). Service was excellent - our waiter was great. However, not too impressed with the hostess staff. Great decor and high ceilings - a favorite of mine.

I ate slowly and was hoping that it would never end. but it did. and I want it now.Additionally I have to make a note about the service which I thought was extremely professional and impeccable. The woman sitting next to me was not happy with her dish bc of pieces of jalapeno which she didn't realize were going to be spicy. One of the managers came over and very kindly offered to bring her a new dish-- sans jalapeno. His mannerisms and service definitely made the woman a VERY happy customer and it also indirectly affected me, a bystander of the situation. He handled it with finesse and grace which led me to understand why Blue Water has a well respected reputation.

3.0,8/6/2013,"5 stars for one brunch dish, 2 stars for dinner. 3 stars overall. After my stellar brunch experience a few weeks ago I was really excited to come back! A few friends and I were in the mood for seafood and looking for a late dinner. We were able to get a last minute reservation in the jazz room and I was even more excited because I had been thinking of planning my birthday brunch in their jazz room.Unfortunately, this dinner was the opposite of my wonderful brunch experience. Our waiter was TERRIBLE. Absolutely terrible. It took forever to place our order and after we did we barely saw him. He looked annoyed the few times we did see him and asked for something. We had ordered a bottle of bubbly and after pouring our glasses the rest of the bottle was nowhere in sight. My friend asked the waiter to bring over the bottle and specifically asked him to just leave it on the table. He didn't. He filled one glass to empty out the bottle and took it with him.  Once our entrees came, we didn't see him again until we were basically done; like we each had about a bite left on our plates when he asked us if everything was okay or if we needed anything. Now onto the food, which I can't say was much better than meh. We all shared a few apps and entrees. The lobster bisque was lukewarm at best and had zero pieces of lobster. There was, however, a shrimp in the middle of the bowl. The crabcake was TINY and nothing to write home about and the beet salad was average. The tuna tartar was good, but aside from using bad tuna, how can you really mess that up?The chilean sea bass entree was good but the price ($38) was a little on the high side for the portion they give. The grilled shrimp and scallop entree was pretty mediocre; the 2 scallops were tiny and the shrimp were overcooked. All in all, I'm glad I didn't plan my birthday brunch here. Yes, I had one great brunch dish a few weeks ago, but aside from coming for that specific dish I don't think I'll be trying anything else. The food and service just don't justify the prices.",0,0,0,Jen G.,"New York, NY",36,188,0

First of all, it seems like every BR Guest (corporate entity that owns this place) restaurant has the exact same menu for restaurant week! I mean, really? You couldn't change it up just a little?!My girlfriend had the sushi roll as her appetizer - it was OK (the sushi place down the block from me in Astoria has better sushi for a fraction of the price) and I had the key west shrimp, which were not bad, but not that great all things considering. We both decided to go for the salmon as our entree and were shocked to see when it came out served on a bed of canned corn! No potato, no rice, no other veggies of any kind, just corn. Seriously?! I mean, I love corn, I eat it straight out of the can sometimes when I don't want to cook myself dinner, but when I'm at a nice fancy restaurant for a pricey dinner, I do not want canned corn with my Salmon! The Salmon itself was wonderful and a decent size portion. My friend got the chocolate cheesecake for desert, which was just too rich to eat.

Look lady, I know it must be annoying to have us regular folk coming in to try the food on a more wallet-friendly menu but don't judge. My issue with RW is that the menu never shows off the best items but I understand why at the same time. Nevertheless, the Salmon entree I chose had an awesome crispy skin and it was pretty damn good. My key lime shrimp appetizer was ok but not memorable but the triple chocolate cheesecake dessert was a delight. Dessert was definitely the highlight of my meal at Blue Water Grill. What I loved most about this restaurant was the decor itself. I felt like I was back in the 60's, very Mad Men-esque. It's a huge space, with two floors, high ceilings, dimly lit and just oozes class and sexyiness. Deep inside, I hoped Don Draper would walk in, be a cocky douche and take me home after my meal.

3.0,7/27/2013,"We recently came here for Restaurant Week as an excuse to 1) eat really good seafood and 2) look pretty.  We made a reservation for 8:15 and showed up right on time.  The hostess was very nice and said we would have to wait a few minutes.  Okay, no big deal.  We were seated on the second floor, which overlooks the first floor.  The ambiance of this place is great.Our waitress brought over both the regular dinner menu as well as the RW menu.  As she handed them to us, she caught herself saying, ""I figured you were her for Restaurant Week"".  Oh okay, let me take off a star for that.  Sorry we were dressed pretty but not pretty enough for your standards.  The rest of the meal she was very pleasant but that line left a bad taste in our mouth.The drink menu is pretty solid and they have a decent wine list.  For our apps, 3 of us had the shrimp, and 1 of us had the gazpacho.  The shrimp was good and the tomatoes were fresh.  I heard the gazpacho was very yummy, as well.  We all chose the salmon for our entree.  The salmon was cooked to perfection and had the most amazing skin on it.  The portion was on the small side and left us wanting more but I've come to learn that nicer restaurants go easy on the food.  For dessert, 2 of us had the chocolate cheesecake, while the other two had the upside down cake.  The upside down cake was okay and had a pretty good homemade ice cream on top.  The cheesecake was a bit too chocolate-y for me and took away from the beauty that is cheesecake.  Our waitress did remember us mentioning it had been someone's birthday so that person's dessert came with a candle on top.  Overall, this is a very nice and beautiful restaurant, however, I don't think t's worthy of all the stars it has received.  Was the food good?  Yes, for the most part.  The service was friendly and really fast.  The bathrooms are clean but there is only one upstairs.  I would try this place out again without it being RW simply because I want to see what else they have to offer.  I think they chose some of their least popular items for the RW menu, which is fine but come on.  For less than what it would usually cost though, I can't complain.",3,1,2,Kristy R.,"New York, NY",421,1576,174
4.0,7/25/2013,"A friend and I ate at Blue Water Grill for the first time for NYC Restaurant Week. We booked the Jazz Room, a separate dining area in the basement with a live jazz band and romantic ambiance.The menu was a standard seafood menu. I ordered:Yellowtail tuna rollSalmonTriple Chocolate CheesecakeThe tuna roll was okay - nothing special. The fish was good, but the ratio of rice to fish was 3-1 so I couldn't taste the tuna that much. Salmon - I asked for medium, but it came medium-well. I still enjoyed it though, and the presentation was beautiful.I was going to order the upside down cake with berry ice cream, but instead went with the triple chocolate cheesecake. My friend ordered the upside down cake and I definitely recommend that. It was crunchy, light, and the berry ice cream added a perfect ending to the meal. The triple chocolate cheesecake was obviously chocolate-y, but it didn't really taste like cheesecake. It's definitely for chocolate lovers - it was rich in flavor and the texture was so smooth. But after eating 2 courses I definitely wanted a light dessert so I liked the upside down cake better. The presentation of both the desserts was amazing and beautiful.The main aspect of the restaurant that would bring me back is the Jazz Room. If you can book a reservation there, definitely do so! We sat right in front of the jazz band, which included a piano, trumpet, cello, and drums.

4.0,7/15/2013,"When I heard we were going to the Blue Water Grill I was not excited.  See, I'm not a fish person.  I can name about 3 or 4 water animals that I actually enjoy.  Not to worry though, many seafood stops offer up chicken dishes, and that's exactly what I got.You may ask- who goes to lunch at a seafood/sushi place an orders a chicken salad?  This gal does.  And I'm glad I did- because today's lunch was delish.The Grilled Chicken Cobb, while a bit small for $16, was really tasty.  Crisp Romain, little bites of chicken and bacon, an entire boiled egg, and about half of an avocado.  I opted to try their champagne vinaigrette instead of the recommended sherry.  Champagne vinaigrette = tangy and sweet and so good.  Separately the ingredients just made up a typical salad- but toss it in that vinaigrette and it totally transforms. And this will sound a little funny- but indulge in a roll from the basket they leave on the table.  Baked soft and topped with a sprinkle of sea salt- they were awesome.  And perfect with a little whipped butter or to soak up a little bit of lobster bisque. For dessert I had a beautiful bowl of sorbets.  The order comes with one scoop of each of the following: white peach, pineapple and lychee ($6).  Pineapple and peach were the winners for me.  Lychee is (in my opinion) and acquired taste.  I'm not there yet.  Also got to try the chocolate chip cookies ($6 for 4).  Good cookie to chocolate ratio but the cookies were a bit crumbly.  Bummer.The restaurant is beautiful & has a cool old club type of vibe.  Service was great, our waitress was engaging and fun and was awesome with refills and such.  Overall great visit to the Blue Water.",0,0,1,Alyssa R.,"Brooklyn, NY",662,1128,2864

Food unfortunately has never been all that extraordinary for me though. Prices also pretty extreme for the quality of the food as well. I think that is why I return every few years, I forget that the food experience is mediocre. We started off with the bread basket, which was quite good actually and a great start to the meal. Next were the oysters which were super fresh but on the pricey side. We then shared a couple of sushi rolls, the Union Square and the Crunchy Florida Roll. Both were good, but not mind blowing in the least and a bit expensive for what you get. Next was the spicy shrimp tacos, which were not spicy at all but one of the tastier parts of the meal. We also ordered the halibut special which was underseasoned and overpriced. We ended the meal with the salted caramel cake which was really undercooked and pasty. Overall, its a wonderful location for people watching and maybe grabbing a drink or snack, but food is just not worth the visit and the price point is way too high.

I hate apples...), but we ordered The New Yorker (which had celery in it...)- it was different but okay.

4.0,4/18/2013,"This place has high ratings, so you know the food is good, and you can find the options on their online menu. So for the part that is hearder to figure out before going: the setting, etc: A group of three of us came here on a Wednesday night around 8:30. We didn't have a reservation, but it is a large restaurant (good for groups, there were definitely birthdays going on) so were able to sit right away. It's a classy type place, with chandeliers. We sat in a booth... I like booths. They also have an upstairs balcony-type area that could be good for a large party. We got some bread in the beginning. Then to start, my friends got oysters, I got salmon sashimi. Then for each of our main courses we got 2 sushi rolls, the shrimp and scallops main course, and the sesame crusted soy tuna with lo mein. The sesame crusted tuna was my dish and it was delicious. Also, because of the lo mein, it was a large portion - in case that's what you are looking for. We didn't get dessert, but we some going by that looked nice. The only downside was that our waitress was a klutz:1- I wanted nigiri as an appetizer, but to make sure, I specifically asked, ""is it the nigiri or sashimi that comes with the rice?"" She said sashimi, so I ordered sashimi, and got sashimi. Grr, I wanted the one with the rice. Whatever, I ate it because I don't mind it. 2- when picking up our forks after appetizers she accidentally flung my friend's extra fork across the table and into her 3- when picking something else up from the table she knocked over the candle. Real flame. Good thing we were quick. ...she wasn't the one putting the dishes on the table, but imagine if it had beenAll in all, I'd totally recommend it though.",0,1,0,Caitlin B.,"New York, NY",3,280,35

1.0,4/10/2013,"My 75 year old mother  meant to  treat me to an what we thought would be an afternoon easter ""dinner""  at the Blue water grill. She made the reservation and was assured that the dinner menu would be available as well as the brunch menu (this was important, we did not want to have french toast for our easter meal),  we got there and waited for a table for a while (understandable its a busy place and a holiday).  But, when we got the menu it as brunch only and really no seafood offerings at all.  We were disappointed but what can you do?   We proceeded to order glasses of wine.  We then had it pointed out  to us that the 10 pinot grigio offering was the ""entry level"" wine.  Excuse me?  condescend much?  I mean, your wine list is not all that and very over priced so Yes, we will make due with the ""entry level"" offering.  Food was ok. very average, the calamare was a generous portion but nothing special at all and a little greasy.  The brown bread with my gravlax was stale.  Then the woman next to us accidently knocked my mom's water glass in to her lap.  The woman  was mortified but these things happen and we had a laugh about it.  The waitress came by and threw a napkin at my mother to clean herself off and disappeared. Oh well, she was busy afterall I suppose but never a word about it when  she came back to give us the check.  We tipped 25% as ii was a holiday.My mom wrote a letter to the corporate office about this as she was very disappointed and received an email apologizing and asked us to contact the Restaurant manager so he coud apologize directly and  book us a reservation so they could ""show us what they really can do""  Excuse me?  You want us to book a reservation and plunk down another couple of hundred?  Really BWG?  I called as I couldnt believe this and the manager basically parroted back the same thing and tried to make a reservation.  I couldnt believe my ears.  Not even an offer for a free appetizer or a free drink on the house?  Way to keep it classy BWG.

The manager immediately came to apologize, offered to take $20 off the bill for dry-cleaning, and left us his card to make sure that the money is indeed taken off the bill (which it was in perfect order).

Maybe it was the offer of a free mimosa only to be told that they wouldn't be available to noon (can I get a refund of the price of the meal without the mimosa?).  Or maybe it was the turkey bacon that just wasn't that great.  I tried to convince myself that I should love this place, but when you serve the omelette (or the frittata that my partner had) with salad instead of home fries, well, at least I was bound for disappointment.  We did start with the spicy tuna roll that was terrific.

Ok, sorry about that...rant over.  Once seated, the dining experience was lovely.  The bf and I shared the lobster bisque and crab cake appetizers.  I thought the lobster bisque was some of the best I've had.  The crab cake was also delicious (not a rogue piece of cartilage in sight!), though the remoulade a little subtle for my taste.  The soup was my fav for sure.  For the entrees he went with a shrimp and scallops medley, cooked perfectly, and I went for a bleu cheese encrusted filet mignon.  The portion was huge!  I was pleasantly surprised.  It was also a perfect rare for me and the sauce was decadent.  For dessert we shared a creme brulee and a molten chocolate cake.  Both was good, but standard in terms of other brulees and cakes, so they didn't stand out as anything unusual in the dessert world.  Had I been paying full price I would've been very happy with the appetizers and entrees, but maybe would have skipped the desserts since they weren't very unusual.  I don't know about the other items on the menu, but the plates zipping around the dining room all looked mouthwatering, so I'd imagine they've got preparation of meats and fish down pat.",0,0,0,Anne Marie B.,"Manhattan, NY",134,425,3

5.0,2/7/2013,"I went to Blue Water Grill for dinner for Restaurant Week. I've heard such great things about the place and it certainly did not disappoint expectations.The appetizer was some sort of caramelized onion-gueyere tart or whatnot. It was basically a tart made of duck topped with figs, onions, and greens. It was a beautiful sized portion that made me significantly less hungry (especially paired with delicious though somewhat hard free bread) yet left a great amount of room for the entree. The duck was a tad bit salty, but overall very well done. 8/10The entree was some sort of salmon dish, I forget the exact name, but was excellent. It was perfection; the fish was flaky and tasty without being excessively salty and sat on a bed of onions and greens and a bunch of other things that are too classy for me to really know. I enjoyed the dish and once again the portion was excellent; the fish was thick but not too big to leave you feeling stuffed at the end. 10/10The dessert was a chocolate-butterscotch tart with some coffee ice cream. Like everything else, it wasn't too big or small and was not excessively sweet, which I thought was the best part. The ice cream paired well and was incredibly thick and creamy. 8/10The ambience was great and service was incredibly friendly; I felt too plebeian to be at such a fancy and classy restaurant.

5.0,2/7/2013,"Have only had business lunches here but it's one of my favorite places in and around Union Square.  I always get their fresh grilled seasonal fish.  You pick a fillet that they marinate in lemon juice, wine and capers and it's then served with lovely little new potatoes, some broccolini (kind of a cross between broccoli and broccoli rabe without any of the bitterness!) and a lemon wedge.  So simple and so incredibly good.  Perfectly cooked fish with the crunchy skin still on.  I had the trout the first time and then tried the Mediterranean Branzino, which was amazing.  Also had a side of their roasted brussel sprouts and tried their Brussel Sprout Caesar Salad.  So unusual and just delicious.  Service is always impeccable.  They have a cast of thousands so you never want for anything.  And the place has this wonderful old, elegant seafood restaurant vibe.  Their crab cakes are out of this world too!",0,0,0,Peggy R.,"Hoboken, NJ",0,30,0
3.0,2/5/2013,"Dined here last night for NY Restaurant Week and the food was delicious. I ordered from the regular menu because the Restaurant Week menu was kind of limited for my taste. I had the Blackened Swordfish with Lump Crab and Sweet Potato Hash (amazing!). My friend got the Steak with French Fries from the RW Menu and she was happy with hers as well. The disappointment came with their desserts. I ordered their famous Caramelized Banana Ice Cream Tower and it really wasn't all that great. The ""tower"" was too sweet and the bananas inside it were too mushy (not caramelized at all). The banana ice cream was so-so...the consistency was on the gummy side for me. My other gripe would the seating arrangements. For such a massive restaurant, they made sure to cram a table in every space that they can! I hate restaurants that do this because if I'm paying top money to dine there then the last thing I want is to be elbow to elbow with the other diners. If I can hear the conversation of the people in the tables next to me then there's a problem. The service was fast and friendly. The clientele was definitely on the rich, snooty side so make sure you dress appropriately. I will probably come back again but only for a very special (expensive) date.",0,0,0,Eve L.,"Brooklyn, NY",27,68,4
2.0,2/3/2013,"Came here on a rec from my brother who is a foodie & used to live nearby. Love the decor, the vibe, etc. However, I have to say...I wasn't impressed with the food. The calamari app was ok, but the calamari were def frozen before they threw them in the fryer. I have had MUCH better in Philly & the Lehigh Valley. The lobster/shrimp spring rolls were good, but again...nothing special. Tasted like typical chain fare. It reminds me of a PF Changs, but w/seafood instead of Chinese. Our entrees (Mahi & Filet) were both WAY salty. I ordered my steak medium rare & it came out charred on the outside & completely red, blood raw on the inside. Ive never sent anything back in a restaurant, but I had to this time. They were super nice about it & it came back out perfectly cooked. We got the apple crisp w/homemade vanilla ice cream for dessert & it was delicious. Def the highlight of the meal. The service was fab, fast, & friendly. That's not enough to make me come back tho.

4.0,2/1/2013,"I wanted a great excuse to finally head to Blue Water Grill, and the lunchtime Restaurant Week menu was enough for me and my seafood-loving colleague. For a late lunch, we had some impeccable service. The service and wait team was friendly, kind, and courteous and attended to our every need. From asking about each course to checking in on our departure back to work, we felt well taken care of during our meal.We started with the arugula salad and hamachi roll. The roll was flavorful, the hamachi's salty taste being a great contrast to the citrus-based aioli-textured dipping sauce. I recommend having the roll without soy sauce. We both ordered the hake, though a little sad that the dorry was no longer on the menu). The curry sauce was light and only added to the breaded, flakey fish and roasted vegetables on top. The cauliflowers were well cooked. Lastly, chocolate torte with  cappuccino ice cream. The garnish of salted caramel plays well with the think graham cracker crust and ganache texture of the chocolate.Hard to find Restaurant Week menus - let alone lunch menus - that are well worth the time and can provide a welcoming introduction to a restaurant.

Not sure what I had, but I tried something new from their menu.It happened to be restaurant week; 2 of us decided to go for that menu. I had the spicy white tuna roll (so did my colleague) - delicious. For the main course, I had salmon and asked for it as rare as possible. It was. PERFECT!! Absolutely delicious. My colleague chose the steak with fries - he really liked it. The dessert was some kind of chocolate situation with butterscotch sauce and a small scoop of gelato...sigh....heaven on a plate. Wait....I need a moment...Ok...other stuff at the table:-Tons of sushi - they raved about all of it-Some kind of fish - I think it was catfish with a sweet potato concoction - her favorite-Lobster mashed potatoes...decadent with large pieces of lobster - outstanding-calamari - not greasy and not too chewy - really good-chocolate lava cake (didn't get the report on that)-chocolate chip cookies (she said they were fab)-key lime something or other (he loved it)All in all - a wonderful meal.

4.0,1/28/2013,"I have never had anything close to a bad meal here.  In fact I have had some very good meals here.  We were here most recently for Restaurant Week and even the the Restaurant Week menu was very limited, my food was once again outstanding.  I had a spicy tuna roll for an appetizer and hake for my main course and a really tasty chocolate thing (it was a couple of weeks ago I forgot exactly what it was) for dessert.The only downside was that our server was a little too much in our face.  I guess if we had never ordered a bottle of wine I wouldn't be complaining but she kept coming back to our table to refill our glasses.  She should have just poured a little more into each glass the first time.  When she finally poured the bottle out, she asked if we wanted another.  We declined.  As soon as I as the first to finish his glass did finish, she was right there telling me that even though we didn't want another bottle, I could order my own glass.  No, thank you.  I told my wife that this was getting silly already.  Well, it got sillier because as my wife and daughter finished theirs, our server was back telling them the same thing.  Yeah  know restaurants love wine sales but she really was getting in our way.  I pretty much told her, in a nice way, to am-scray.  If the food wasn't so good, my rating would be lower.

1.0,1/25/2013,"I came here with three of my friends for a restaurant week dinner. My friend was having his wisdom teeth removed the next day, so we figured let's go out to a nice dinner and send him off with a full stomach before the surgery.To all of those martini drinkers out there, I would steer clear when you come to this restaurant. We ordered dirty martinis. The first round of dirty martinis came, and were heavily diluted. I understand they give it in a pint glass with ice so you effectively get two martinis, but I'd much rather prefer that they give a larger, single martini that isn't diluted, IMO.We asked the waiter if he could bring the second round of martinis straight up without the pint glass of ice. Our intention was to get a less diluted martini. This time the martini was loaded with vermouth and olive juice (we were having dirty martinis). We had to ask for shots of vodka to pour on top of the martinis to make the drinks somewhat tolerable. But I must say, it was easily the worst martini I've ever had in Manhattan. I couldn't get the taste of vermouth out of my mouth for the rest of the night. Normally I would NEVER return drinks, but these were unacceptable. The incompetence of the bartender was astounding. Moving onto the food. We ordered the calamari, dumplings, ravioli, and spring roll. The calamari was over-fried, and the dumplings and ravioli were ice cold. The spring roll was good (and hot). The problem was that these appetizers all took at least 45 minutes to bring out from the minute we sat down. I understand it was a busy night, but for a place like this, I don't expect to wait that long, and I certainly expect hot food.So the dinner isn't going along quite as expected, but we still have our restaurant week dinner to look forward to. Two of my friends ordered the sushi appetizer, and my other friend and I ordered the soup. The waiter brings out spoons, chopsticks, and soy sauce. Certainly looking forward to the first course.Yet again, our minds are blown away when, after waiting another 45 minutes, they bring out our main courses and completely forget to bring the appetizers. Stunned, we let the waiter know about this, yet he doesn't have the courage to take fault, and decides to blame the kitchen for the error. Dear waiter, the reason you are called a waiter is because you wait on tables. This wasn't the kitchen's fault. It was clearly yours. Now, although our experience was by no means acceptable, I do want to thank Jesse, the Operations Manager. He compensated us for the ravioli, gave us free dessert, gave us a la carte prices for the entrees (which he should have, considering we didn't get the first course), and a round of scotches at the end. If it wasn't for Jesse and the great live band downstairs, it would have easily been the worst experience I've ever had. A shout out to the waitress who took over after our first waiter. She was very nice and attentive. Took great care of the table.I understand that this is a popular place, and it seemed like everyone around us was getting what they ordered and were having a good time; however, it was really disappointing to come to Blue Water Grill and have this experience. I am hoping this doesn't happen to anyone else.",0,0,0,G H.,"New York, NY",0,4,0

They were pretty busy with mostly a business leaning crowd during lunch, but our server was very attentive and got us through lunch at exactly the right pace. I was feeling pretty up in the air today so I let her pick my entrée and dessert and I picked the tuna roll app. The roll came out almost immediately (cant really blame them, I am sure they prepare them in large batches for the RW menu). I enjoyed it though I tried to scrape off the Korean bbq sauce on the bottom of the roll. It wasn't bad, but I didn't particularly like a lot of it. The hake, which she recommended over the salmon and the petit filet, was delicious. Hake is a cod like flakey white fish, and this one was really well cooked with a mustard crust, fregola (couscous like pasta), and cauliflower. I really enjoyed the fish and it was a hearty portion perfect for lunch. We finished with a lemon tart served brulee style with a caramelized sugar crust on top. It was a nice light way to finish the meal. Overall I though their food was well presented, mostly well coordinated flavors with appropriate portion sizes, and very efficient and friendly service.

They didn't know it, so I can't fault them for not bowling me over and whatnot, but the experience just didn't sit too well woth me overall. Hostess was delightful, seemed actually happy to be there. I honestly don't expect people in the service industry to enjoy their job, so it was a fun surprise to see.That said, the waitress seemed busy and bored with us. I get it, we were only a two top and we split a fifty dollar shellfish tower. I didn't even order a drink, but thats because of dietry issues. Also, it was my birthday, so I was gonna order whatever the hell I wanted, big or small. Food arrived quickly, as tasty but poorly portioned. I mean, we culd have easily ordered to separate entrees for the same price and perhaps we should have. Ordered a 'molten chocolate cake,' and what arrived was a lukewarm, crusty, solid mass of brownie dough. I didn't order it myself, and I figured I shouldn't -- ya don't necessarily go to a seafood place for the desserts. All in all, kinda disappointing from a point of view of service, as well as portion size and even flavor.

Since there r quite a few other customers sitting outside at the time we figured it would be ok. When we got to our table the heat lamp was not turned on, the hostess who took us to our table said our waiter would turn it on for us. We waited in the cold for about 15 min, and still no waiter. My date had to go ask for one. Finally someone came over and told us that the lamp does not work. We ask the hostess to switch us to the inside table, she told us that it would 10 min so we waited and waited. Then finally she returns and said it would be at least 45 min. At this time we have already been in the restaurant for more than 30min. So we spoke to the manager, Tom, I think was his name, he told us the heat lamp is now working and that he would make sure to take care of us if we give it another chance. So we said ok. 5 min after we sat down, the lamp turned off. We basically just laugh it off at this time...Tom came over and moved us to an inside table in the back (why it became available immediately at this time and not 45 min is beyond me...maybe earlier they were saving it for more important people?). My date and I decided not to let the misfortune ruin our night, so we ordered drinks, apps, and desserts. (I won't comment on how bad our waiter was...he took our orders and was not seen again until he dropped off the check).  The manager did not come by to check on us at the end of our meal to ""take care"" of us.

Orders were taken, drinks came out quickly and then we waited and waited and waited for our brunch selections. We had to request our bread basket which was disappointing compared to past visits. Simple bread rolls served cold. Oh and by the way one of the meal selections we asked for had run out so an alternate had to be ordered. After 20 minutes I had to flag the waiter down to see why our meal was taking so long when you would have expected him to have checked in with us much sooner to explain the delay. For reasons unknown the kitchen was apparently very far behind. Ten more minutes and we again requested of the manager what the hold up was to our meal. He was polite and went to check and while doing so our meals finally arrived. of the orders, the burger was cooked properly, the requested well done fries not well done. The Waldorf salad missing bacon, apple and dressing, the eggs Benedict with crab served barely warm and the home fries were doused in salt making them uneatable. This seems to imply a very rushed prep in the kitchen with little attention to making sure the food came out as ordered or that it was properly seasoned and dressed. We didnt complain further as we simply wanted to finish the meal and leave. To the managers credit when I had questioned the long delay in service earlier did offer to comp us desert which we declined, everyone was watching their weight, but he does get points for making the offer. Nevertheless this was a very disappointing meal considering I've had really some nice experiences in the past. While they can sometimes hit the mark it seems they just cant do it consistently and this makes it no longer an automatic go to place when Im in the area and its off my recommend list to friends. Really a disappointment..",0,0,0,Joe B.,"Jackson Heights, NY",0,156,0

2.0,10/25/2012,"As a general fan of the BR Guest restaurant group, I was disappointed in Blue Water Grill.Was with a party of 3 - we arrived early and had drinks at the bar.  Service was ok, and the drinks were not bad.Upon being seated, we had a fairly long wait before the waiter showed up - although he was very apologetic about the wait.  We ordered the grilled calamari, which was good, and the shrimp dumplings, which were also pretty good.For entrees we had the salmon over lobster risotto, seared tuna, and Chilean sea bass.  Everyone was disappointed with their meal.- The salmon was the best of the three - nothing particularly bad about it, just a bit bland.- The tuna came served over lo mein noodles that were drenched in soy sauce to the point of being almost inedible.- The Chilean Sea bass actually tasted fishy to me and the side dishes were too drenched in the wasabi vinaigrette to have any flavor of their own.For dessert, the waiter brought complimentary creme brulees because of the wait - which was very nice of him, and actually, I didn't find the wait time to be over long.So, the service was attentive, they were accommodating and wanting to make up for areas in which they were lacking, but the food was such a disappointment that I wouldn't be back.",0,0,0,Lauren D.,"Hoboken, NJ",32,145,0

2.0,9/21/2012,"Bummed out.  This used to be one of my favorite places in the city.  But my fiance and I went last night and were NOT thrilled.We sat on the patio - which may be why we had bad service.  But it's a high end restaurant so they don't really get the benefit of the doubt.  For $35 an entree , they should know better.So we get our food, which was fine.  Started with appetizers and a glass of wine.  We had water in our glasses but then, we never saw our waiter again and apparently no one else serves water.  Our calamari plate sat on the table through our whole dinner.  When they dropped off our dinner plates, they completely ignored the appetizer plate that was pushed to the other side of the table.  No one refilled our (by then) empty water glasses and I would have liked another glass of wine with my entree.  So there I was I was trying to get my waiter's attention but he's passing the patio doors 6 or 7 times without even glancing our way.  My fish is getting cold while I'm trying to get more water and wine!!!!I'm sitting in a way that made it tough for me to get out without asking Eric to get up and moving a bunch of stuff, so I got on my cell phone and called the restaurant.   I told them that we'd like more water and a glass of wine and that we've been neglected for about a 1/2 hour.  The hostess was appropriately sorry and sent our guy over immediately.  Now here's the kicker and why I won't be going back.  Our waiter comes over and DOESN'T apologize!  He just goes ""I hear you need more water""Most people would apologize and make an explanation so we could understand but he went out of his way to NOT apologize.  It makes me sound like a total B**CH but I swear, we were sitting there with NO water and empty plates and wine glasses for a 1/2 hour!  That's just not acceptable right?  Is it just me?  I would have thought so but the table a bit further down was experiencing the same frustration.By the end, I got the glass of wine when I just 2/3 of the way done with my fish.  Not really the way it should be.  And guess what?  The Calamari plate was STILL THERE!!!!!    They only removed the calamari plate when they removed our entree plates.  It sat there getting old on our table for 45 minutes.  And the waiter was over at our table 3 times (once for the water, once with the wine, and again for some more water) after I complained and didn't remove it.  I guess we were just supposed to live with it.Funny how we got the bill about 10 seconds after we asked for it.  Eric gets his credit card receipts back and is about to put the tip on it when our waiter MYSTERIOUSLY appears and says ""We took care of a glass of wine for you"".  COMPLETELY not acknowledging his dropping of the ball.  And again, no apology.The waiter should have apologized and/or the manager (who will NOT budge from next to the hostess stand) should have come over.  He must have heard my phone call. Bummed out that a NY institution would just make a $200 meal on a thursday night a less than enjoyable experience.  I guess they just take it for granted that people will come since it's in Union Square.It's a shame.  And we won't be going back.  I guess they can go ahead and keep serving the tourists badly.  I live here and I'm NOT putting up with that.  HOW many other places would have bent over backwards for us?  Basically every restaurant but the Blue Water Grill.",0,3,0,rebecca k.,"New York, NY",49,38,3

It's refreshing in this upscale dining culture to find someone with a sense of humor. We all blacked out and ordered a tuna festival - Tuna tacos, Toro, Spicy Tuna Roll and oysters for appetizers.  Toro is toro - can't beat it.  The Spicy Tuna roll wasn't the best roll I've ever had, but was pretty generous and spicy.  Tacos were nothing to write home about - skip these if you're looking to optimize your order down, as everything's attractive.Entree: Sesame-Crusted, Seared Tuna over lo mein with vegetables.  It's atypical to serve a raw fish over a hot side - but the lo mein was fantastic and had a nice vegetable crunch.  The tuna was cut a little thicker than what I prefer, but still flaked perfectly with a fork and was delicious.  The Chilean Sea bass my dad had was insanely good.I wouldn't say it's the most unique - it's a classic seafood standby in U Square - but it's the definition of a solid pick for family or clients.  Definitely enjoyed it.",0,0,2,Emily R.,"Manhattan, NY",452,361,4

Fast forward  ten years - Now that we've hit 2012, this place is still nice, however, not comparable to some of the other fine dining establishments out there. Not quite sure if I would spend a Friday night here anymore, unless it's packed with my friends. The interior is classic and sweet and who doesn't love booths? You can order all of your all time favorite seafood dishes... Like Lobster... and Raw Bar... and Lobster...The food is tasty - modern in a classic way, slightly tastier than Central Park Boat House if you're going for Classic American fare. The only problem is that there is no lake next to them and no row boats as a saving grace (I love my row boats). So, what to order? I'd say that the best meals to order are the raw bar tiers. You can't go wrong. Also- Lobster. Always. Sushi is okay, it's definitely done well, however, not the best out there. I would skip ordering an all sushi dinner and focus on the entrees. The Salmon is pretty good, although not fantastic. I like the Lobster Mashed potatoes, although it's more hype than anything. I've never once had the Branzino, but maybe that will change soon. The Blue Cheese Filet Mignon- Mm. I love Filet Mignon and find that this particular one is as satisfying as the Seared Rib Eye Steak in Green Peppercorn sauce served in Cafe Centro.For dessert, I've had the sorbet (always a good choice), the fondue and their frozen banana tower thing, which quite honestly, looks much more impressive than it tastes.

Despite the hustle and bustle of the union square area, once inside I found it peaceful and classy and a nice departure. The interior was a nice dimly lit and a creamy place. Went afterwork and the first floor was indeed kind of full, especially around the bar. We sat in a nice booth area against the wall in the back. I had a nice view of the restaurant and outdoor dining area. It was open yet intimate. Our waitress was high energy and very informative. Im a sauvignon blanc drinker, specifically not from New Zealand. They didnt have any blanc by the glass but she highly recommended a very similar wine which worked wonderfully! Fruity and semi dry, I wish i could remember the name of it. Something from France with a ""G"". So just a heads up for other SB lovers. I tried the tuna taco appetizer, the ginger-spu chilean sea bass w/ lobster mash, and i also ordered a side of the lump crab and sweet potatoe hash since they made it sound so good. I would definitely pass on the crab & potato hash next time, was pretty dry and too potatoey for me, not enough crab, did not complement any of my flavors for the night. My tacos were small and not memorable and I wish I would have tried the entree shrimp tacos instead. I thoroughly enjoyed my chilean sea bass and lobster mashed. Very well prepared, good flavors, and good portion. The mashed was just regular mashed with a large piece of lobster meat in the center but it was still yummy and worked well with my bass. Im glad she was able to switch out the soba noodles for the mashed instead of having to charge me for the side order. Overall, great service, wonderful evening.

4.0,8/15/2012,"Since I wanted to go somewhere cool and fancy this year for my birthday, I had to research. Remembering this place from back in the day when I used to hang out Union Square at my friend's dorm I decided it would make an excellent for celebrating my bday. The place was really beautiful on the inside and had tons of space, with large open doors on the left of the restaurant. It was on the hotter side, probably because there is outside seating and the doors have to be open for waiters to go in and out.  Since it WAS my birthday and I do go into fat ass mode when I'm not paying, I ordered whatever I thought I could stuff into my belly. First it was the lobster bisque and yellow fin tuna tacos. Bisque was delicious and had a small hint of spiciness to it while the tuna tacos were small and came with only 3 but were tasty, fresh and a nice appetizer. Then on to my Chilean Sea Bass and lobster mashed potatoes. Lobster mashed were devine, smooth and creamy and I don't even like mashed potatoes!!! The bass was alright. The asian flavor of the dish was definitely not something I was used to and didn't wow me like I thought it would. I didn't finish it but it was something I wanted to try. Then dessert was red velvet cheesecake and ice cream which were both nice ending to a great meal. The service was good, our waitress never skipped a beat. The only thing is the bathroom is like 2 flights down and there is candles lining each step. For me, that seems pretty dangerous. My dress could have caught on fire if I didn't see those freaken things. Anyways the prices are a bit steep and I think it could have gotten a five if they weren't so freaken expensive.

We went for the prix fixe dinner menu during NYC restaurant weeks. The starter was salmon roll. For obvious reasons since this is a western style restaurant, I assumed the roll would be roll in pastry in western style. But it came as a Japanese Salmon rolls... weird and the menu was misleading in some sense. The roll itself didn't taste fresh. It's almost like I was eating lunch leftovers... I sent it back and have the beets salad instead. The salad was better than the salmon roll, but not great. The salad dressing was not enough and nothing specially tasty.Then it came the entree. I ordered the grill salmon (you can't never have too much salmon!). Major disappointment... First, I ordered the salmon to be medium cooked, it came as well done... Very dry and I couldn't taste any seasoning at all.... Major let down. The sauce... nothing special... again a bit dry.... the corns not sweet enough and watery....Finally the desert. I ordered the chocolate mousse cake. Sighing... I thought they were using hot chocolate power to make the mousse... and the cake itself....too hard and lack of flavor. It would be great if it had some spices kick in there. But nada in reality....Again, the best thing in that restaurant is the service. They didn't charge my dinner because I told them I didn't like any of the three courses. And I guess in some way I'm a tough crowd to please since I travel to work a lot and eat out quite often.They sincerely asked me to come back for the normal menu, but I honestly doubt I will come back for a second try especially there are gazillion restaurants in NYC. And I thought it was a great shame that they didn't plan to impress customers for their prix fixe menu during such a festival. Isn't this would be the best time to shine and win over customers? :D",1,0,0,Ricki H.,"San Francisco, CA",6,62,0

Anyways, the Spicy Thai Salmon Roll had a delicious salmon tartar on top, but the filling was very disappointing. The Taku River Sockeye Salmon was absolutely delicious!

Our waitress was super sweet and brought out bread and drinks very quickly. I started with the spicy thai salmon roll and he had the spiced market beet salad. The salmon roll wasn't spicy. It had pineapple and something that tasted like apples inside topped off with cilantro aioli. The beet salad was great.. Sweet beets and he really loves the pistachio and the feta cheese combination. Just the two of these got us semi full. Then came the lobster roll; for some odd reason I thought it was another sushi dish, but it was sandwich with mountains of lobster. I kid you not. It was lobster and it was delicious! There's lots of bacon and little slices of cherry tomatoes. The fries that came with it was made perfectly! He had the snapper a la plancha. I wish I had ordered this because it was soooo gooood! The snapper was about palm size and made well and tasted good by itself. But when you had it with the eggplant or the yellow sauce it came with or the pickled peppers (they might have been jalepenos) it made it that much better! Last, we had the triple chocolate torte and strawberry shortcake. Sorry, strawberry shortcake did not impress me. It kinda tasted like frozen strawberries.

Hence, it's one of my favorite restaurants in Union Square.If you're in the mood to eat nothing but stuff from the sea, I would recommend getting the shellfish tower. If you divide the $48 price tag for the 2-serving tower between 2 people, it's only $24 per person. It's the price of a regular entree.Otherwise, I usually opt for something from the simply grilled section of the menu. In my opinion you can't go wrong with a grilled salmon or shrimp & scallops.The service is top-notch. If you made a reservation, expect a friendly call from the restaurant the day to serve as a reminder. The waiters aren't exactly overly friendly, but they're professional so you're getting proper service nonetheless.If the restaurant's not too busy, ask if you can dine upstairs.

2.0,6/22/2012,"Started off as a great night.  Wanted to take my 19 year old cousin from Germany out to a nice restaurant as this is the first time she has every experienced NY.  Great atmosphere.  They seated us, a party of 3, in a large booth upstairs looking down at the oyster bar. Very cool. The waitress was very friendly, the GM came over to greet himself, and told us he would be back later on to see how our meal was going..seemed like it was going to be a pleasant experience.  Well I tried to order a bottle of wine for the table.  The server forgot to ID us.  Im twenty five and my other friend that was with my cousin and I is 30.  She came back and realized she hadn't ID'd us.  That's fine she ID'd us.  She did.  Then obviously my younger cousin couldn't drink.  I would not have held that against her.  My cousin is from Germany so it was just and adjustment for the while that she has been here....and I mean she looks older than I do and it's just wine with dinner.  But I understand rules and laws in America.  So I wasn't upset by any means I just didn't want to order a bottle of wine.  Well after that incident that must have flustered the server because she stopped paying attention to our table. My friend did order a glass of wine.My friend asked for a basket of warm bread because it was cold.  She said Ok she could do that for us.   10 minutes later...no bread....but there's our server within eye shot talking it up with a larger party.  Another 10 minutes passes us by....still no bread... The server is about to breeze past us when my friend catches her attention again.  My friend asks about the bread.  It was obvious that she had forgotten.  Whatever shes human that's ok.  But a couple minutes later she comes back with the bread, just tosses it on the table and scurries off to the larger table without saying it.  At this point I am pissed.  You don'  t just throw bread on a table like that.   5 minutes later our food comes out.  My crab cake was cold but good, Salad was good.  Calamari was fresh.  But still my friend wanted another glass of wine but she had not asked for a refill.  Our waters had not been touched.  Literally, 2 minutes after the food has been dropped off, barely had a bite, she comes and asks us how our food is.  Meanwhile avoiding eye contact with me.  So awkward.I was just upset because I wanted my cousin to have a good experience in a fancy restaurant.  I will not be coming back again. The GM never made his second round to see how we were. That's fine but don't come around saying you will be back if you do not come back.  We were there for almost an hour and a half.  There was time for the manager to recirculate. It also frustrates me because I am a nurse,  and I know what it is like running around for people and am empathetic..... so even though I look younger and I am 25....I tip well. But I am not going to tip someone something they do not deserve....very disappointed.  Will NOT be back.  Oh and the reason why I am giving it 2 stars is just because the beginning of the night with the wine incident I feel a little guilty for trying to press that on, and it did seem like that it would be a good experience and the food was good.  Otherwise it would only be 1.",0,0,0,Tricia S.,"Astoria, NY",0,5,0

4.0,5/24/2012,"I'm on the fence about whether to give them a 3 star or 4 star review. The food here, like all BRGuest restaurants, is phenomenal. And I generally think it's worth the high prices. However, some of their portions have become surprisingly small. Last weekend my friend and I both got the seafood cobb salad and for $25 we shouldn't be so hungry afterwards. I remember getting this salad a year ago at another one of their restaurants and the portion was much more generous. The other reason I considered a 3 star review is because they are always late to seat you and if you sit in some sections -- like upstairs and outside -- you are often forgotten about. So I think I'd give 5 stars for food, 3 stars for portion/price, 3-4 stars for service.

We were visiting NYC from So Cal and my wife's friends who were visiting from Houston invited us to join them there. I'm not a fan of seafood and protested vehemently about the schlep down there from the upper eastside, but the wife made me go. I had the chicken, which was on the rubbery side. We couldn't hear ourselves talk over the constant din. The noise was even worse downstairs with all the deafening jazz music and everyone trying to talk over it. Romantic? Don't think so.

4.0,4/26/2012,"Classy seafood spot right off the Southwest corner of Union Square. So, one downside is when you leave the restaurant, you usually have to listen to some hippie congregation shouting into megaphones to protest something insignificant while you wait to hail a cab.  Other than that, there's nothing seriously negative to say about this place. The portions are typical NYC sizes and it's fairly expensive, but it's a great place for dates or special occasions. There's an upstairs and a jazz room downstairs. Not sure how often it happens but when I was there, a jazz string quartet played through dinner. I was originally placed at a table directly next to the quartet but I politely asked to be moved and they didn't hesitate to move me and my girlfriend to a more private table in the corner even though the table seated six.  The food came out in a timely manner and was clearly fresh and high quality.  This place is particularly great for the summer, (but that might be because I for some reason enjoy seafood more in the summer).",0,0,0,Bobby V.,"Manhattan, NY",2,35,0

They generously split the salad for us (beet, goat cheese & wild arugula salad with toasted almond vinaigrette) which was delicious. We ended our meal with 3 sushi rolls (Rainbow, Lobster, and one other one) which were all delicious & the presentation was pretty. The drinks that we had to go along with our meal was made very well and were tasty. I ordered one that was very refreshing (had some fruity sake), and my boyfriend ordered something with gin that was good as well.

I was really excited after finally getting the chance to try it out during Restaurant Week Winter 2012.Once walking in, I was very impressed by the ambiance of the restaurant. The place is huge with many standalone tables, spacious booths and even had a mezzanine floor, which me and my 2 girlfriends were sat in a very comfortable and large booth. The bar was set up in the center and the decor was very nice.The food however, was mediocre. Maybe it was just their Restaurant Week menu but I wasn't impressed with anything I got and my girlfriends didn't seem amazed either. Two of us ordered the fluke roll appetizer and while the fluke was very delicious, the radish (or some sort of carrot) inside the roll and the grapefruit, in my opinion, did not mesh together well. I then ordered the Open Filet sandwich and it was, essentially, a fancy philly cheesesteak. It was good, nothing spectacular. I would rather pay 5$ for a hearty cheesesteak from Wogies or 99 miles to philly. My two girlfriends got the cod over rissoto and while that was better than my entree (the cod was cooked pretty much perfectly) but still not mindblowing.For dessert, I got a selection of the sorbets and they were great. They had coconut, pear, and raspberry (I believe) and they were all delicious.Maybe I need to come back for the non-restaurant week menu, but all-in-all I was not too impressed by the food.",1,0,1,Nancy S.,"Manhattan, NY",224,153,2

After looking for a while, Blue Water Grill seemed to be the spot - $125pp minimum, no prix-fixe menu, live Jazz Band in the Jazz room through the night and complimentary champagne toasts and NYE accessories. Check! Check! Check! (FYI: you were also able to sit upstairs and enjoy some music - a DJ poppin hip hop and pop - while also still having the same wonderful balloon display and lights, but I believe there was no preset amount per person if you did that.) So my party of 4 arrived at their most earliest Jazz room reservation hour and Blue Water Grill was at it's most joyful. Black and white balloons adorned the ceiling, lights were glittering, people were in their  best dresses and the air was alive! So nice! After checking in, there was a nice girl at the hostess stand that took our coats to coat check. We were sent downstairs to the Jazz room and we were all set! Table for 4 right in front of the band. Off to a good start if I do say so myself.So we were given menus as usual, with a nice extra menu portraying all of the night's specials, including some pricier wines and champagne bottles ($150+). After perusing the menus, we decided to just order in waves to keep us occupied through the night. We started off with a crunchy Florida roll, grilled octopus and a shrimp and lobster spring roll (my favorite from the 3). Our waiter was knowledgeable and nice enough to help us select a wine that would go with almost anything. Food came pretty well timed and our waiter was always around to pour us another glass. Check! Check! The band still hadn't started so we were just sitting around and talking without having to scream. At around 9pm, the band finally came on. It consisted of a pianist, a singer, a bass guitar player and... someone else that I can't remember. It was all good until they took their 1st break shortly after they started. In my mind, they hadn't been playing anywhere near long enough to be taking a break already. But fine... fine. The night was young and maybe they had to save their energy. Sadly... no. My biggest complaint about this night actually was the fact that they weren't on long enough at any point during the night to actually feel like we were listening to a band playing. In fact, I somehow feel like their breaks were just as long as their actual playing time, making my thought-to-be Jazz-filled night a night that was, instead, half empty. Sorry to say but I take the negative road on this one.The rest of the evening, minus the jazz band, was great though. All our food was as great as I remember and our waiter was oh-so-nice, despite his already set 20% tip for the night. Best dishes were the specials which I'd mention but can't, at this point in time, remember.If I had to do it again, I might... but maybe not downstairs. I was really disappointed in the play time of the Jazz band. It didn't seem to warrant the $125pp minimum esp if I could've sat upstairs, had the same food and had music all the way through.",0,0,0,Nerissa I.,"New York, NY",181,151,121

2.0,1/9/2012,"First off, I'll say the food is pretty good here. But the service was absolutely horrific. I will not be back because of it. I had a reservation for 8 o'clock. We got there promptly and were told to wait another 2 minutes. 10 minutes go by we are still not seated so I go and ask the lady how much longer, and she replies nastily ""I told you before another 5 minutes"". Another 10 minutes go by, and I've been waiting for 20 minutes already, and still not seated. At this point, I went up to the lady and told her that we've been waiting for 20 minutes where she rolls her eyes and goes ""Please be patient"". At this point I was getting annoyed so I told her that I was going to leave if we had to wait much longer. Suddenly, she became super sweet and found a seat for us. Once seated, while our waiter was attentive, he was kind of cold. I think Ocean Grill (one of the sister restaurants) is much better.",0,0,0,Jeff W.,"Manhattan, NY",418,81,0

It is not the most intimate place, but its classy decor is very appealing and feels fit for any special occasion. Yelpers have commented that the chilean sea bass melts in your mouth... well it does indeed. Like Pavlov's dog, when someone says the word ""Blue Water"" an image of that sea bass comes to mind and I start drooling right there dead in my tracks. For dessert we split the chocolate fondue, which of course also melted in my mouth... lots of melting at the Blue Water Grill.

2.0,12/27/2011,"I came here to meet some people for drinks, so I cannot comment on the food.  I really liked the decor of the place.  It is always nice when a restaurant in an older building uses that old-world style to add character, rather than gut the place to make it look modern.  The restaurant is huge, with a large main dining room, a mezzanine, and a dining room downstairs with a jazz band.What was not equally huge was the bar, which is small and awkwardly sits in a walkway.  The service was good and the bartender was friendly.  Our bartender was even nice enough to re-pour my wife's glass of wine after she dumped it on herself.  What I did not like was that when we were asked if we wanted another round of drinks and we said no, we got another round anyway.  I guess at Blue Water Grill ""yes"" and ""no"" sound a lot alike.   The bartender looked very confused and then after a weird staring contest, she said she would take them off the bill.  However, they ended up on the bill of another person in our party - not cool IMO.  I followed up with the people in our group that stayed for dinner and they really enjoyed their food.  I may be back to eat, but I doubt I will be back for drinks.",2,2,1,Dan C.,"New York, NY",989,942,532
2.0,12/26/2011,Spent Christmas Eve here as well as my Birthday dinner on the 24th. I have spent several special events at BWG as well as at Ocean Grill. My experience the other evening was not typical of my be our guest experiences in the past...We arrived 15 min before our 8:45 reservation. The lobby area was so packed with people we had to crawl over them to get to the reception area. It seemed the whole night that they had over booked the evening. All the servers had an overworked run down look and feel. Our server was friendly enough but was just going through the motions. My steak was served room temperature. It also took 25 min after we ordered our bottle of wine before it came to our table.I usually love it here and was sad that my birthday was an exception.Maybe management could be a little more attentive to over-booking on Holidays?,0,0,0,Ryan C.,"Manhattan, NY",0,4,1

2.0,12/10/2011,"Had dinner here a couple of days ago and walked out of there feeling a bit disappointed. I think the place is definitely overrated. The seafood tower was very fresh and good but definitely overpriced. The only thing on the tower I didn't like was the scallops which didn't have much flavor in the sauce. We ordered a bunch of food and were able to taste a little bit of everything:1) we ordered 4 fish dishes (cod, swordfish, branzino and bass). All were overcooked and dry. The atlantic cod entree looked amazing plating wise. The swordtail entree was only good because of the sweet potato hash; it was supposed to have brussels sprouts in the dish but I only found 2 pieces of it. 2) octopus salad- the octopus was burnt to crisp on both salads and we had to send it back.3) crab cakes- good, but nothing memorable4) brussels sprouts- it was a bit too soft and mushy but I love brussels sprouts so I still ate it.5) sweet potato hash- AMAZING. A must order side dish. I wouldn't even mind having this an entree.6) caramel banana ice cream tower- so GOOD! Not too sweet and the cone that it comes in has a toffee bite to it. Dig right in bc the bananas are on the bottom and it's like finding treasure.7) Red velvet cheesecake- sorbet was decent, the cheesecake didn't really taste like cheesecake. It was just ok. It looked better than it tasted.At the end of the night, the only two things that were memorable was the sweet potato hash and the banana ice cream tower. I probably wouldn't come back here for dinner or lunch but I hear the brunch is good (have yet to try it).",0,0,0,sally w.,"New York, NY",5,93,0

4.0,11/29/2011,"Consistently good, conveniently located, efficient service and overall, a respectable venue for most any occasion (eg. lunch business appointments, family dinner, and dinner dates). I started coming to Blue Water Grill (BWG) since 2004 and have permanently saved their number to my phone book. If ever I need to entertain a last minute out of town guest at a white table-cloth type of restaurant and just don't have time to be thoughtful about where to go, I often default to BWG or the tavern side of Gramercy Tavern (GT). However, it's easier to go to BWG since you can probably make a reservation earlier that same day and avoid having to wait for your table at GT. The above point is really the reason why BWG has always stayed a staple restaurant in my NY black book. But also, it can be impressive if you are not expecting much, while at the same time not over the top. Nobody I have taken there, has ever felt out of place and service is decent (neither offensive or overly pristine/ostentatious). Likewise, the value is 'manhattan-affordable' if you order sensibly (eg. grilled fish mains are under $30 and appetizers/sushi rolls are typically between ~$15-20). But given it is right in the middle of Union Square and the quality of fresh fish they offer, I think the price is certainly justified. BWG is a kind of place that I don't go to every night or wait anxiously in anticipation to try, but is the ideal white table cloth kind of spot you can go to regularly (eg. small-time celebrations, a monthly indulgence, a 'just because I love you' date, etc). Note, if you go - go to the jazz room and ask to sit in the corner (too close to the live band, and you won't be able to hear each other). Sit upstairs in the dining room and you'll feel like it's a power dining room filled with lots of  bus boys weaving through your tables.",0,0,0,Clara H.,"Manhattan, NY",35,138,159

Two people at the table ordered the grilled swordfish. One person got the swordfish the other clearly got salmon. When the waitress finally availed herself to the table and was told about the mistake, she acted as if the 4 people at the table did not know the difference between a pink piece of salmon and a white piece of swordfish and refused to acknowledge the wrong dish was delivered.  She offered to send the manager over after making another pass by the table (never once asking if everything was ok).  After waiting for at least 40 minutes for food we were all starving and I just ate what was in front of me.  Our table of 4 had to get back to the office.  The manager (obviously an idiot with no customer service skills) safely came over after all the plates were cleared to ask me if I had any questions about the meal I had just eaten.  I was appalled to think they expected me to acknowledge they delivered me swordfish instead of the salmon I had just eaten.. It must look the same coming out of the frozen food bag?  This place was hip in the early 90's it's an unacceptable dump now!   This is a seafood place? Stay away..

I was seated on the second level, seats are a bit cramped. Mirrors on the back wall were pretty unappealing to the eye (possibly water stains all over). The service. Our waiter was the rudest person that I have ever met in a somewhat upscale restaurant. He was curt and blunt. And didn't have the courtesy to even smile. Whether he was having a bad day or not, we were still the customers. His attitude was nonchalant. He disappeared most the time when we needed service. As we were looking around the floor for him, he was spotted chit chatting with other colleagues. Needless to say, he did not receive a very generous tip. We spoke with a manager who apologized and gave us his business card. The food. The food was delicious. I ordered the tartare as my appetizer and the swordfish as my entree. I loved it.

2.0,9/16/2011,"As a previous diner at other BR Guest restaurants, my expectations were set high-as I've never had a bad experience. I decided to try out Blue MWater Grill with my dad and sister last night for the first time. My sister arrived first, 15 minutes before our reservation. The hostess told her to have a seat and the table would be ready soon. As I arrived just as our reservation was, I sat down next to her. After 40 minutes of us waiting for our table--and 30 past our reservation time we were finally sat. The table was barely ready for us. It wasn't set and we were sat at a table that was broken, with 2 out of the 3 chairs broken as well. It took a good 7 minutes for someone to even come to our table to ask what kind of water we wanted. Then, took our order for drinks. The bottle of wine we ordered-wasn't available so a different server came over to ask if there was something else that we would want. As a side note-I knew there were dinner specials available that night, because I read it on their Twitter account-we were never told about them. When the bottle of wine we ordered came to the table, there was a glass of Proseco for each of us as an apology for the delay in our reservation. That was nice of the Matre'd. The bottle of wine was opened on the table, but not poured. It was set down and the waiter said he would come back to pour it for us when we were done with the Proseco. Then he disappeared. He never came to pour it, nor  take our order. Another 10 minutes later we had to flag down someone to take our order. After that, everything went well--except for the fact that the servers never checked on us and pretty much ignored our table. I saw them go to other tables, just not ours. Luckily, the food was great. I had the Sea Bass and possibly the best piece of fish I've had in a long time. My dad got the grilled Branzino and sister the Sesame Crusted Tuna, both delicious as well (although small portions). At the end of the meal we were given a dessert menu, again server never came back to check on us. Finally--gave us our check, then disappeared when we were ready to have it settled out. All in all, it was a pretty  terrible experience--besides the fact that the food was amazing.

2.0,9/14/2011,"I had been meaning to try this place for some time. I had a spontaneous date there this past weekend and Blue Water unfortunately disappointed me.The decor is lovely and the chandeliers are beautiful. I think they kind of bank on that sort of thing because everything else was sub-par. Honestly our waitress was ok but her wine suggestion was morbid. I asked for the lightest white wine and unfortunately I received a glass of vinegar practically. Maybe the wine had just gone sour. The oysters were actually fresh and and great so they were the best part of the meal. I ordered the scallops and shrimp. I was always confused on food tv shows when people complained about shrimp being overcooked because I thought ""How the heck does one overcook shrimp??"" I just just never had an overcooked shrimp until that meal. Those little suckers were nearly impenetrable! The scallops were just ok - nothing special. The broccoli rabe they serve it with was overly bitter. My boyfriend had the filet which he enjoyed - bittersweet since this is a place advertised for seafood. There are way better seafood places for the same price. No wonder they can keep the place looking so nice because they are way overcharging for the quality of their shellfish.

4.0,9/11/2011,"I was wavering between 3 and 4 stars on this one because the experience can vary dramatically depending on how busy they are when you come in, who your server is, and what you order.  Also, having eaten at Blue Water Grill over the past 10 years, I can say it had a better buzz and slightly better food 10 years ago.  That being said, its still one of the best spots in the Union Square neighborhood and has consistently fresh seafood and an overall solid menu. The outdoor seating is a nice extra, especially if you have a table in which you can people-watch along the park. The inside decor is sort of New Englandy and casual, could use a little updating but still very nice.  I've had several waiters in there who were spot on perfect, attentive, knew the menu well, etc.  I once had a newer server who had a real tough time and made the experience frustrating.I'll throw out some of my favorites - the seafood cobb salad is totally yum, the grilled fishes are always fresh and well prepared.  I also like the burger as a nice alternative for people who don't love seafood. Check it out- it should never be a 2-star experience, and hopefully you'll have that excellent experience which they are capable of delivering.

I fear this chain is getting too self-important for its own good, and needs a refresher course for their staff in customer relations.  It takes a lot to alienate a regular customer.  This met that criteria.Merle KaufmanSoHo",0,0,0,Merle K.,"New York, NY",0,13,0

4.0,8/19/2011,"Came here for restaurant week dinner with some friends and thoroughly enjoyed the meal.I will say that I was initially disappointed because their online menu said they had soft-shell crabs but it was nowhere to be found on the in-real-life menu. I quickly forgot about it after experiencing how good everything else was (a couple of glasses of white wine didn't hurt either).I believe the starter I ordered was a tuna roll. It was good, but not spectacular. I didn't expect sushi to be particularly good at a place with ""grill"" in its name. It did come with a good curry glaze though.For the entree, I had the red snapper. It wasn't too fishy and was perfectly cooked. You could taste the flavor of the fish, but it wasn't overwhelming at all. The dish came with some leafy greens and other vegetables, but the snapper definitely stood on its own (this is also after two bottles of white wine).Our waiter looked like he was in high school, but was very friendly and helpful. One of my friends was being a bit of a jerk about a typo on the menu and the waiter just rolled with it and joked along.My only complaint was that when I arrived, I told the hostesses that I was waiting for the rest of my party to show up and they told me that they would have the table ready. Five minutes later, my entire party showed and I made sure that the hostesses knew. I waited another 5-10 minutes (since they were busy with other guests) and then had to ask to be seated (the table was indeed ready for us though).",1,0,0,Kenny C.,"Brooklyn, NY",884,3337,12015

Even the whole ambiance of the entire restaurant...made me feel like they were looking to turn their tables quickly which meant getting their current patrons out ASAP!The outdoor seating was never really planned or thought through.

2.0,8/8/2011,"Sigh; I feel like every time I try a semi-expensive restaurant these days I'm really disappointed.  Living in NY, I've walked past Blue Water Grill a thousand times and the customers always look like they're having such a great time.  This restaurant is beautiful in its own way (it reminds me slightly of an upscale LI diner but I guess that's just home to me).  The wine list is comprehensive and the one we had was crisp and delicious - perfect for a hot Saturday night in August.  For apps, I had raw oysters and Seth had lobster bisque (we're starting to get predictable, aren't we?).  The oysters just didn't taste right (thank God I didn't get sick).  A tad too briny, definitely a lot of shell pieces, not a good experience.  Seth's bisque was just strange.  I usually like when they serve it so the lobster is in the bowl and then they pour the creamy goodness over it at the table, but in this case it just made it obvious how little lobster there was (close to nothing).  And the lobster was surrounded by two crackers - I guess to give the stuff in the bowl more weight before they poured on the bisque, but it just didn't work.  On top of that the bisque was too tomatoey and not creamy enough.  For whatever reason I was under the impression that the sushi here was good (I guess because it takes up half of the menu) but I had a softshell crab roll that was far less tasty then I can get from the takeout places in Brooklyn (I've still yet to find a place on the UES I like).  Seth's Chilean sea bass was good, and besides the wine, the only good thing we had.  Even if this place was close to getting three stars (which it wasn't) it definitely would not because the ladies room had no soap (grossss!).  As I said to Seth while walking out, you think if you pay $200 for dinner, there would at least be soap in the bathroom.",0,0,0,Erika G.,"Manhattan, NY",1,88,0

The goat cheese was coated with breading and fried, giving it a nice crispy outside. Went really well with the greens. The entree was not good. The fish was overcooked a dry.

4.0,8/4/2011,"Don't make the mistake I made!  If you have any inclination whatsoever to chilean sea bass, listen to the reviewers here and order the thing.  I was torn between the CSB and the red snapper, and inexplicably went with the snapper, which was fine (a tad overcooked), but didn't compare to the tender, perfectly prepared soy-ginger-glazed CSB, which my girlfriend wisely ordered.  As for appetizers, we split the beet salad, which was fantastic.  It is normally served with arugula, which I detest, so they graciously substituted fresh spinach.  Given that we each ordered separate appetizers aside from that, the ""half"" portion we each received was perfect.The grilled calamari had a nice flavor, though to my palate it was blackened just a shade more than ideal, and served in a smaller portion than I had hoped.  It was served on a bed of arugula; had the menu explained that I would have again asked them to substitute spinach.The cheesecake dessert was fantastic. A layer of cheesecake below, with a layer of red velvet above, topped with vanilla ice cream and garnished with rhubarb.  It was a modest slice to begin with and we shared it, but it was so rich, even the half portion was completely satisfying.We sat on the lower level so we could enjoy the jazz, which was fantastic; great band, great singer; lively, but not overpowering.  We had what we considered to be the best table in the room -- a corner table behind the pianist.  It's a credit to the sound system that we sat so close to the music and had no difficulty hearing each other in conversation.  The service was excellent; the hostess was friendly and professional, and our server was very personable and accommodating and also highly professional, none of that slightly intrusive and overbearing chatter that too often characterizes waitstaff that are just trying to be friendly.All in all a great experience.  Not perfect, but almost as good as could be expected.",2,0,1,Joel B.,"Manhattan, NY",7,21,5

5.0,7/31/2011,"Russell and I have been on a seafood kick lately, especially since he has decided to go vegetarian again.That being said, we decided upon the Blue Water Grill at Union Square for our 3rd year anniversary dinner. Blue Water Grill seems perfect for a casual lunch, but it's impeccable service and waiting staff also makes it a wonderful choice for special events.We made reservations for 7:15, but by arriving a little bit early, I think we beat most of the Sunday evening dinner crowd. Per our request, we were seated outside with a fantastic view of Union Square.Our server's name was Dan and he was great, attentive and got our sense of humor (which few servers do).For my drink, I got the Tokyo Rose, which our server actually poured at the table (which I thought was a nice touch). After disapproving of his cocktail, Rusty settled on a glass of Chardonnay.We started off our meal with some really good bread and butter, followed by the Townhouse Shellfish Tower ($45). It came with Maine Lobster, King Crab Legs, jumbo shrimp, littleneck clams, oysters, ceviche and mussels. It was a great selection for two people to share and it came with a melange of dipping sauces. I am not usually a fan of oysters, but these ones were delicious! All of the seafood tasted very fresh, so I couldn't help but love it all. The meat on the lobster and crab was easily accessible, you needed only prod it with you fork.After eating everything on the tower, I was too full to go for a full-out entree, so I got the Atlantic Sushi Roll (shrimp, hamachi, romaine and walnut -tamarind), which was also quite good. Russell got the Blackened Swordfish with crab and corn hash, which honestly would have been my choice for an entree as well. It was quite tasty. While the fish was perfectly crispy on the outside, it was moist and tender inside! Perfectly cooked, not a second overdone. Russell had heard good things about the desserts here, so we had to try one. We settled on the cheesecake which was served with a layer of Red Velvet Cake and strawberry ice cream and a strawberry sauce. This desert was absolutely wonderful! It wasn't too sweet and no flavor was overwhelming...My only regret was that I did not get a serving for myself! They also brought us a plate of complimentary cheesecake bites (which was a great surprise).Would I go back to this place? Definitely. I am usually very apprehensive of cold seafood platters, but I actually can't wait to go back and have the Shellfish Tower again. If I get an entree, I will probably go with the Grilled Jumbo Shrimp and Scallops because the jumbo shrimp at this place are HUGE.The service was quick and polite, but I never felt rushed. When we were being served our Tower, it was quite large so the maitre de actually rushed over to help our server arrange the table...Now that's something that impressed me and won me over.This place reminds me of what it is to be a diner at a restaurant...to be waited on. Although the customer certainly isn't always right...It's good to be treated like you are, and Blue Water Grill has certainly gotten that right.They also have live music, a vast wine selection and interesting appetizers.

5.0,7/31/2011,"This place was GREAT!!! Best Seafood spot located near Union Square. Carol and I came here for our 3 year anniversary, and from the service to the meals to the dessert everything was A++. Our Waiter was ""41 Daniel F."" Who was great from the moment we walked in to our exit. He was polite, joked around, and had the best recommendations. He was very honest when it came to food selection, and was on point when it came to new silver, & to refills. He also checked in very frequently to see how everything was going. Dan was the Man for sure.We started off with drinks, I ordered some mix drink which happened to be too strong but Carol was able to finish it. I actually forgot I'm not a fan of Cocktails, so I resorted to a Chardonnay White which compliments seafood in a fantastic way. Carol enjoyed the Tokyo Rose also, but I'll let her tell it in her review.For starters we grabbed the Town House which came in at $45.00. This was a starter for two, and Carol seemed to really enjoy the King Crab leg as she didn't bother saving any for me to try!!! Honestly she thought it was lobster, but after my bad experience at citycrabnyc.com I haven't really been interested in any King Crab legs for a while. I really enjoyed the Lobster tail piece, and variety of Shell/Oyster/Mussels on this. The sauces were perfectly selected, and the portion really hit the spot but leaving enough room for dinner. After we finished with the lovely Town House, Carol ordered an Atlantic Roll $14.00 (House Sushi) and I ordered the Blackened Swordfish $29.99 which was DeLISH! It had bits of crab meat mixed with corn, and the Swordfish could of been mistaking for a Filet Mignon if I were blindfolded. It was a great experience that I WILL recommend to anybody. Carol also seemed to enjoy taking pieces of my Swordfish as well. I heard from fellow Yelper's that this place had great dessert so I knew this would be a requirement upon leaving so we decided to go with the Velvet Cheesecake $8.00.  This was amazing. I thought everything of this meal was worth it, and for a date this place is one of the best tickets in NYC.

4.0,7/25/2011,"The big down side of this place is their service; slow slow slow~  But we enjoyed the live jazz performance and the seafood, so can't complain much. =)We ordered one of their Shellfish Towers (Townhouse), which came with half lobster tail, king crab leg, jumbo shrimps, little neck clams, east and west coast oysters, ceviche, and marinated PEI mussels. Everything was very fresh and we especially loved the king crab leg, ceviche, and mussels.Then, we got the RW menu and ordered the shrimp salad/soup for appetizer and the Alaskan King Salmon for entree. The soup was pretty average, but the Salmon was amazing! We ordered it medium and it was prepared to perfection with crispy skin~ :drilling: So So SOO good. The only problem was that we were only half full after all the food above. So, we decided to order a rainbow roll before dessert. The rainbow roll was fulfilling with pretty decent sashimi slices on top, but the sushi rice was not prepared right; oh well, kind of not the right place to hold high expectations for Sushi per say. Anyway, then we had our peach creme burlee tart; it was alright. Overall, we liked the seafood here, enjoyed the live jazz music, but the portions are relatively small and service is slowwwww~~~  I give it 3.5-star rating, rounding up to a 4.

The goat cheese salad appetizer was so good I wondered if they had Billy right in the kitchen for convenience. That's how fresh it was.I initially ordered the red snapper for an entree on a bed of veggies but sent it back because of the sauce, which tasted like French salad dressing. No bueno. However, the salmon on tabbouleh was perfect! Nicely charred on the outside. Medium cooked and moist on the inside. Blue Water makes really good drinks and presented desserts good enough to smile over.If you've never been, I will say make reservations as the restaurant can get very crowded.

2.0,7/18/2011,"I've been to Blue Water Grill 2x for brunch / lunch so my review only applies for brunch / lunch. I came here a couple of months ago for brunch with two of my friends and we thought the prices were fairly reasonably since they give you coffee or tea & an alcoholic drink with your brunch entree. I got the corned beef hash with a mimosa and coffee. The corned beef hash was average, nothing memorable. Our drinks finally came after we asked the waitress a couple of times. After waiting for 10 minutes, we expected our coffee to be hot, at least warm, but boy were we wrong. It was cold and when we told our waitress our coffee was cold, she said ""would you like some fresh coffee?"" with an attitude. No, I love having old and cold coffee but thought I just share that with you. After waiting another 5 minutes, we finally got some fresh coffee. I came back again this past Saturday with the boyfriend since we were in the neighborhood and assumed they were serving brunch. BEWARE: they only serve brunch on SUNDAY and NOT Saturday. We were tempted to leave when we asked for the brunch menu and were told they only have 3 ""brunch"" special items on Saturdays. The tables near us had the same problem, they were expecting brunch but was told they were only serving lunch with 3 brunch items. I got the pancakes with fresh blueberries and raspberries and the bf got the omelet with asparagus, goat cheese and heirloom tomatoes and a side of potatoes. Very overpriced for average food and tiny portions. Way too much goat cheese in the omelet. After our entrees, i decided to order the flute sushi to give their seafood a try since that's what they're known for before I write this restaurant off forever. After waiting about 20 minutes for one piece of overprice and microscopic flute sushi ($4), we were ready to leave and never return. The fish seemed fresh but honestly, I couldn't even tell you how good or bad it was because the piece was so tiny. Service was slow / inattentive both times, though the waiter from Saturday was way better than the last time I was there. I even complained about their slow service and no brunch on Saturdays on their comment card. 2 stars for the decor and awesome looking wine cellar downstairs.",0,1,0,Man Chi N.,"Manhattan, NY",77,75,612

We were four for a pleasant get to know you business dinner. Food and company good, the former a little overpriced, but terrible waiter. Some highlights: tried to upsell us on the seafood tower, got confused when we debated and stuck with original plans, read the whole order back to us but still forgot an appetizer. (When the others arrived: ""I forgot to put it into the system, do you still want it"".)He didn't identify our oysters on the platter, then later, abruptly: ""I need to take it away because your entrees are ready, are you going to eat those?""A warning that we might want sides with our delicately sized entrees would have been nice. Ordering drinks was an effort. Is this wine dry? ""I don't know. hmmm, I'll ask."" Comes back again. ""Which one was it you wanted?"" Comes back. ""Yes it is"". It wasn't. He was very confused to be asked for neat scotch (an $18 malt), with water on the side. It came on the rocks. We explained again.

4.0,7/14/2011,"I'm torn between 3 or 4 stars. So, since I was here for RW 2011, I rounded up the stars. Spicy salmon maki- Good but nothing special. Compared this to the  sushi you get from any other sushi restaurant it about the same, except it was paired with a horse radish/ mustard like sauce. The roll wrapped around cucumbers and the salmon was on top of the roll. Sauteed Alaskan Salmon- Bland if you don't add anything else. I usually complain about everything being too salty, but this I had to add a touch of salt and pepper. After the seasoning the dish was from bland to yumm.. fyi: The corn hash under the salmon made this dish delicious.. It made me want more of the summer corn hash. For dessert my friend picked the Creme Brulee tart so I ended up ordering the Milk chocolate crunch bar instead so we can try each others' dessert. I must say the Creme Brulee wasn't what I expect. It didn't have the hard sugar glazed or I didn't notice it on top and the creme it self was mehh. I was glad I ordered the Milk chocolate bar instead. To me it was a little too chocolately but I liked it better compared to the other choice. Over all, would I recommend this place?  Yes and No. The food here is a hit or miss. I know my friend ordered the Cod and it was really good but it wasn't on the RW list. So I would say go here and be selective on what you order.. I recommend the cod and the summer corn hash =)ps.

The restaurant is three-floors (including private dining room in basement) with a generous outside seating area overlooking Union Square Park. The service is friendly right as you step in and are greeted by the host/hostesses. The menu has similarities to its sister BR Guest restaurants, but unique enough to keep you coming back.The shrimp dumplings and shrip/lobster spring rolls are two great ways to wet your palate. The ingredients are fresh and have great flavors.And definitely try the specialty sushi rolls, they are all amazing... we opted with the Atlantic roll that had a great sauce on top with just the right amount of kick.

3.0,7/12/2011,"2011 RESTAURANT REVIEW: I came here last night for dinner and was impressed but wasn't overly impressed. The restaurant itself is pretty big and well decorated, the ambiance is also enjoyable with the music playing in the background. I had the option of sitting outside but it was far to hot yesterday to take part in that. I was seated at a table in the back corner which was fine until more people started piling in. The tables are basically on top of another, which doesn't make for a cozy dining experience. For my meal I had Appetizer: Spicy Salmon Maki: Coconut, Cucumber, Radish Sprout, Curry Aioli. I think this was my favorite part of the meal. It was 6 decent sized pieces of sushi and the perfect combination of flavors. I had poured myself some soy sauce but didn't even need it because the curry aioli on top was perfect for it along with a piece of ginger on top! Flavors were dancing in my mouth. For my entree: Grilled Shrimp and Scallop Skewer Roasted Beet & Potato Salad, Chili Lime Dressing Great idea and concept for a dish but not enough food!! You only get one skewer and it comes with 4 baby shrimp and two scallops. The skewer is served on a bed of spinach, baby potatoes, jicama, artichoke hearts and beets in an oil and vinegar dressing (I made sure of that it wasn't a potato salad with mayo before ordering)! The Chili Lime Dressing is used on the shrimp and scallops and they were very tasty I just would have enjoyed a few more. For dessert: Milk Chocolate Crunch Bar German Chocolate Cake, Creamy Milk Chocolate Mousse, Cherry Ripple Ice Cream This was delicious. The cake itself wasn't heavy it was almost as if the whole piece of cake was mousse like. On top was a petite scoop of ice cream with a cherry drizzle and a few pieces of cherry. Also sticking out of the cake was a square piece of chocolate, more for looks. The presentation of the meals was also really nice. The way my sushi came out was beautiful and then the woman at the table next to me ordered it and they did her's differently and it didn't look nearly as enjoyable. I just wish for the entree portion there was more food. The service was very good although I feel like my waiter could have been a little warmer rather than so drab. The gentleman who served me my meals was very bright and cheery so that was refreshing. I was shocked that by the time I left there was a line out the door.

4.0,7/6/2011,"Blue Water Grill offers reasonably priced fine dining, a relaxing atmosphere, and a memorable experience. I'm always happy when a fish dish tastes fresh and not ""ripe"". While the prices are a bit higher than other seafood spots in Manhattan, go here to experience quality over quantity. So many spots around the city claim to make great seafood dishes in addition to every other turf dish on the planet. But I lament that those market-share-houdinis always seem to miss the boat by over cooking a piece of fish and adding a lot of salt/MSG. Side note: there is a guy that asks if you can ""spare a few dollars and have a nice meal"" on your way in and again when you leave. He's the same guy I've seen in Times Square; his voice is Pixar worthy. :) While some might believe him to be a nuisance, I kinda think he's hilarious, tenacious, and merely adds to the whole experience.

He told me that I had to find the recipe for it, which is funny since I don't cook.  In case that wasn't enough food (and it was, but it was his birthday), we got chocolate fondue for dessert  (the waitress said it was all vegetarian, but there were marshmallows and rice krispy treats, which are almost always non-veg due to gelatin, so I avoided those; there was plenty of fruit and other stuff to dip). It was a nice ending to his birthday meal and we both thought it was fantastic .  We did wait about 10 or 15 minutes past our reservation time (it was a Friday night), but otherwise the service was really good -- attentive without being pushy and friendly without seeming fake.  It was a little pricey, but I made my boyfriend very happy on his birthday which is always a good thing.  We're definitely planning to come back.",0,0,0,Lizzie P.,"Manhattan, NY",0,2,0

The octopus salad was mushy, we sent one of the lobsters back, and the swordfish tasted like a blackened can of tuna. I've had better food in school cafeterias... we walked out. Only saving grace was our wonderful server who brought a round of champagne for the admittedly awful experience. Oh and this all came to the tune of $250 for three people.

4.0,5/4/2011,"Delicious! My first impression was this place is surprisingly large with nice decor. The downstairs jazz room is very quaint and romantic, the upstairs is a bit more hip. We got the cold shellfish sampler for a starter, which was on par, nothing special nothing lacking. For the main course, we had the snapper and the sea bass. The sea bass sauce is exquisite! Some sort of sweet gingery-wasabi concoction. Managed to be rich yet crisp at the same time. The snapper was decent, but the cajun-style spiced rice it came with was brilliant. For dessert, had the highly-touted banana ice-cream tower (or whatever the official name is). Delicious, but super-sweet. This place deserves 5-stars with only one exception: Our waiter (Danny from New Orleans) was friendly, but not knowledgeable and rather forgetful. He forgot both my wine and appetizer orders and had to double-confirm. He had a hard time reciting the specials and could barely introduce our food as it was served.",1,0,0,Charles C.,"New York, NY",321,68,0
2.0,5/4/2011,"Came here for a Saturday lunch. I picked it for location, decor and the multitude of seafood options. All I can say is that none of the dishes we tried impressed. Some of the fish was overcooked and chewy (like the octopus) and other times it was over-seasoned and yet one-dimensional and not tasty at all. We were seated near the waiters station where at times half-a-dozen waiters mulled around dropping silverware and chatting...annoying to say the least. Service in general was ok, our waiter seemed a bit clueless as to the basics like pouring wine for all the ladies at the table first (a little old-school but something I appreciate) The music was a little too loud, especially for an afternoon. Food was blah, my crabcakes were mushy and a too fishy tasting (like the fish wasn't particularity fresh) the mahi-mahi sandwich was so overseasoned and spicy that you couldn't taste the fish at all. The wine list is terribly over-priced with no wines under $42 or so. The mark-ups are crazy too....a $10 bottle for $44. So I unfortunately will not be making a return trip to the Blue Water Grill.

With that note, my favorite dishes were the coconut shrimp sushi roll (never seen it anywhere else, and it was interesting and not bad), and the sweet potato crab hash, also unique, though I'm not sure if crab and sweet potatoes naturally go together but they're two things I like, so why not?",1,0,1,Elizabeth L.,"New York, NY",240,816,249

4.0,4/18/2011,My sister and I ate at blue water grilled on our first night in NYC and this place has a main and a downstairs dinning area. The main floor is more formal and traditional. Downstairs where we decided to have our dinner was more of a relax environment. They had live jazz music and it was very smoothing and relaxing. We started off with lobster bisque and it was just okay. It wasn't the best as I've had better ones elsewhere. My sister ordered the pecan mahi mahi and I ordered the seabass! It melts in your mouth!

The waitress was nice enough.We didn't order from the RW menu, opting for calamari to share and a snapper dish for me and some sushi for my date (wasn't in a sushi mood so I didn't try it).Calamari: greasy breading, buffalo sauce wasn't a strong enough flavor, and the mix of greens on which the calamari sat was a strange choice. Cilantro and basil?Grilled red snapper with sweet potato hash: Bland fish, bland  chimichurri. Should have opted for another sauce. I was looking forward to two of my favorite tastes in the sweet potato hash with crab meat but it was grossly underseasoned. I don't think it was even salted.

3.0,4/6/2011,"The atmosphere was very nice and cosy.  We were seated in the top level in the way corner, so the location had very little traffic. The seats were slightly tight for a party of 7, even though none of us were overweight.  The lack of personal space between different tables was a turn-off.  I felt the next group of people breathing on my neck (exaggeration, but trying to make a point).  The ceiling on the top level had low points in certain areas - one of my girlfriends, who is around 5'9-ish, had to bend her head down while getting up from her seat to prevent her head from hitting the ceiling.  The ""stained"" mirrors on the top level against the walls were not appealing - actually they looked like crap.  The service was great, the waiter was very friendly. The food was mediocre.  I love seafood, but the seafood paella I had was not good at all.  I don't generally associate chicken with seafood paella, but this place serves it with chicken (mixed in the rice).  Although, they took out most of the chicken to accomodate my request, (which I so appreciate their effort), the dish was definitely just mediocre. I thought it tasted overall, a bit salty, and the lobster was overcooked and tough.  Nobody at the table raved about their food, so I guess there was not much to rave about.  I went with the same group of people as to Aquagrill, and I must admit Aquagrill is 100 times better.  So we paid the price for its location.",0,0,0,Quartzi S.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,43,2

3.0,4/1/2011,"Came to Blue Water Grill for dinner since someone gave me a BR Guest certificate as a gift. I had already been to Atlantic Grill, multiple Dos Caminos and Primehouse, so decided to try another BR Guest affiliated restaurant. I love the decor of this place, but its more the old building characteristics then the restaurant. For starters we had the oysters which were fresh and tasty. Next I had the Belgian Endive and Green Apple salad, while my date had the Blue Water Grill Chopped. He raved about the Chopped Salad, but due to my severe dislike of olives, I could not concur. For my main I had the East Coast Swordfish from the grilled menu. I paired it with the spicy tamarind glaze and they went very well together. The service was very good until the end. We were both full from our meal and opted not to have dessert. My date ordered a coffee and I was finishing a glass of wine; however it was obvious the waitress was looking for us to get out. I understand this place is popular and can be busy; however there were many open tables around us. I saw no reason to rush us and while this place is not over the top, its not cheap either. The waitress rushing us certainly put me off a bit. Blue Water Grill is a nice restaurant with solid food; however nothing blew me away.

3.0,3/31/2011,This place is pretty nice. The staff was very friendly and accommodating.Appetizer: I got their oysters. They have a few different kinds and I picked the ones recommended by the waitress. They were pretty solid and the sauce that comes with them was nice.Booze: My lady got 2 drinks and both were well mixed. I stuck with beer and they had some local brews which is always a plus. Dinner: The Chilen (sp) sea bass was awesome! Very flavorful and cooked perfectly. The side dishes were good too (chinese broccoli). My lady got Paella (seafood with rice) and it was just okay. The seafood was kinda bland in there and there was way too much food in it. No room for dessert. The reason it got 3 stars is because it is a little overpriced and in a neighborhood such as where this is if you are gonna pay a lot for food you can find a better place to eat.

At the time, my experience with fine dining was limited, but everything from the appetizers to the sea bass polenta entree to the caramel banana tower for dessert was delicious. The girl next to me had her hair catch fire on the candle - the minor crisis did not take away from the lovely meal. The second time, less so.  My companion had a mouthwatering Mahi Mahi sandwich with sweet potato fries.  It was brunch, so I ordered the crab cake benedict (crab cakes on english muffins with a poached eggs and hollandaise sauce) with home fries.  The poached eggs were overcooked - yolks were the texture of hardboiled.

3.0,3/3/2011,"I came here for a birthday brunch with one of my good friends from school. It's easy to miss the small entrance on the western side of Union Square, but it's deceptive - the restaurant is much larger than it would appear from the outside. We ended up eating downstairs, which lacked the benefit of weekend sunshine, but it still was a very nice atmosphere. In particular, there was live jazz played intermittently in the background, which added a nice, laid-back touch to the restaurant. That being said, it did get pretty warm, and by the time I walked back into the frozen chill outside, I had worked up a good sweat (not awesome).As for the food itself, I was a bit disappointed at the fairly generic menu. The bread served before the meal was delicious, particularly the banana nut bread - you can tell it is made fresh, and it tastes delicious with a dash of butter. The main course was a bit disappointing, though. I was served an omelet that was fairly average by my standards - lots of cheese, not too much flavor otherwise - and, for some reason - my dish came with a lot of salad. I have nothing against salad, but it was an odd choice to half an omelet and more than half a plate full of salad that had a barely detectable amount of vinaigrette on it. I'm a fan of having hash browns or home fries or something more breakfast-y...this was just a strange choice to complement the dish. The glass of orange juice was also fairly small, so even though it was fresh, I ran out too quickly.All in all, it's a nice atmosphere to eat in, but the food was only average.

3.0,2/13/2011,Came here recently because a friend gave us a gift certificate.  I was thinking of giving them 4 starts as our entrees were very good and this place does have good food.  However here is the heart of why I can't give them 4 stars.  For the kind of prices they charge I expect things to be just a bit better than they were.  Our waiter was compenent but he certainly wasn't the level of waiter I'd expect for this kind of restaurant.  When we asked him about whether he liked a dish on the menu he said that other customers had told him they liked it and then he proceeded to list off several other dishes that had also been 'popular'.  I'm not sure he had even ever eaten there or what he thought of the food.  Then at then end of our meal we were given comment cards.  Really?  Comment cards.  I felt like I was at an Olive Garden.  So while the food was up to snuff (except for the endive and apple salad we had which was much too bitter) the service was more of the Olive Garden and Red Lobster level.  Blue Water is part of a restaurant group and that corporate feel comes through loud and clear.  I don't think I would choose to go here in the future unless we get another gift certificate.

When they say it melts in your mouth, this fine piece of fish sets the perfect example. Oh and the butternut squash ravioli was surprisingly delightful, it was sweet and savory. and lastly we had the Portuguese Fisherman's Stew (Octopus, mussels, baby clams, chorizo, gigante beans and escarole). this was a good dish because it's got it's own unique flavors, but I have had better Portuguese seafood stew.

3.0,1/23/2011,"Decided to take my wife out to Sunday brunch at Blue Water Grill. I highly recommend that you call in advance to make reservations as they are extremely busy. Request the Jazz Room since the atmosphere is nicer. Our mistake that we didn't do either.My wife had the corned beef and hash with root veggies and I had the NY Benedict which came on a slightly tough bagel.  We also ordered the Florida Crunch roll since I figured that we should have some type of seafood dish.The roll cam first and I have to say that I was not very impressed. The first piece tasted a bit fishy, which I don't think it should have. It wasn't anything special and a bit pricey for a roll.  Okay, now for the wait.If the restaurant is as busy on Sunday brunch as it is on Friday or Saturday night (this info came the hostess), wouldn't the restaurant have  enough staff on hand to cook and serve the food?  We noticed that other patrons got bread, but I attribute this our waitress being so busy with everyone else.After a long while our food comes and it was okay.  Not bad for brunch. Better than Chat & Chew down the block. The eggs were poached well and the hollandaise sauce was fine.  Portions are not big, so if you are really hungry for breakfast maybe you should consider snacking first. We ordered dessert. The pear bread pudding came with rum raisin (heavy on the rum) ice cream with candied pecans. Take out the bread pudding and this dish is fine. They might as well taken some of the bread from last night,slapped the ice cream top with the pecans and that's your dish.Skip the dessert and ask for more bread. It tastes better this way.Overall, I don't know if this will be our go to place for brunch, but if you want a nice brunch and you're not starving, it is a nice place to go. Price wise the brunch is pretty decent but then again, most brunch menus are made up of the last night's leftovers.I think I will be back again, but not for some time. Maybe in another 6 - 8 months. If I have to choose, I would go uptown to Ocean Grill. Food and service are much better last time we went.",1,1,0,Victor G.,"Bellerose, NY",11,22,4
4.0,1/22/2011,"I've been here a couple times but only with out of town guests.  This serves as a great spot for brunch since they have drink specials and my faves are the bellinis or mimosas.On Sundays they have the live jazz but at the time I came in, the room was reserved for a party so we were seated on the main floor which was fine.The decor is simple yet classy with linen, white tablecloths. There are floor to ceiling windows to allow natural sunlight in or people watch. Service is very attentive and while waiting for your table, you can sit at the bar and have a couple of drinksMy friend and I both ordered the smoked salmon benedict with dill hollandaise sauce.  Usually, I rarely order benedicts since it never satisfies my hunger since breakfast is one of my favorite dishes and always opt for something heavy like omelets, bacon and biscuits. However, I saw a couple servers walk by with that brunch entree and decided those looked delicious.  When the plates came, it definitely met my expectations.  The salmon wasn't too salty or the hollandaise sauce too heavy and overwhelming.  Everything was light right down to the buttermilk biscuit at the bottom.Also surprising was how the roasted potatoes were cooked.  Usually, places overcook them which gives that stretchy texture to them when you bite into it but the potatoes were tender to each touch and dissolved easily in my mouth without much chewing.My orange juice was freshly squeezed without any pulp in it.  It had a nice, natural taste to it and it wasn't too sour or too sweet which I loved.Overall, each visit makes me fall in love with Blue Water Grill even more. I'm pretty happy my friends were impressed with it as well.",2,0,1,Neline S.,"New York, NY",177,422,208
4.0,1/16/2011,"Had a wonderful dinner here to celebrate my friend's 30th birthday with a party of 4. The food quality, atmosphere and pricing met or exceded my expectations based on prior reviews of the restaurant. There were many groups seated in the dining room - which can take advantage of certain menu items, so groups are definitely a good thing at this restaurant. We sat in the jazz room which is lively and fun. Don't come to this room for an intimate conversation, though.The menu is mostly fish, sushi, and a little bit of pasta. I think there is a beef and chicken dish as well, but I'd recommend sticking to the namesake theme. We started with the tuna sashimi and lobster bisque. The tuna was spicy but not hot, accented with grapefruit segments and shaved fennel tossed in a light and fruity vinaigrette. We enjoyed how the sweetness of the grapefruit balanced the dish and vinaigrette stood up to the sharpness of the fennel. The soup came with what were call lobster beignets, which were almost like flash fried gnocci acting as croutons for the soup. They used a rich stock to make it, and the texture was velvety. I thought it was seasoned properly. Very mild. For the main couse, I chose blackened mahi with sweet potato and crab hash. They were out of the swordfish which is normally the fish they use for this plate. The Mahi was cooked perfectly - i can't say i've had it cooked better. The hash was excellent - but I expected more crabmeat. There were maybe 4 small lumps in my serving. Two people had a special, which was short rib ravioli in a broth with seared diver scallops. The scallops were tender and sweet, and with good color on the sear. We did notice occasional grittiness - perhaps sand? It was not enough to mention to our waitress. The short rib ravioli was good - the pasta was extremely thin and melted into the shortribs marvelously. At times, the shortrib meat became just a little dry, but the broth helped overcome this. It was well-executed. The other person at the table got sushi, which she enjoyed but looked like nothing too special. It was fresh and tasty.Dessert was a pear bread pudding sudae with prickly pear sauce - and interesting sweet flavor. I enjoyed, though some at the table didn't care for it as much as I did. There was also a chocolate molten cake - which is richly decadent though not very imaginative and quite common.Service we found to be impeccable. Our waitress was great and she did not rush us, but was there when we needed her. After a bottle of wine, 2 apps, 4 entrees and 2 deserts, we left at about $135 per couple which i felt was well earned. Great place in the city for a terriffic fish meal.

2.0,11/28/2010,"Based on a recommendation from a friend we chose to celebrate Thanksgiving dinner here.  They had a prix fixe menu and also you could order separately so we thought it would offer a nice variety.  We had a 7pm reservation and having read some other reviews we arrived 20 minutes early to ensure we were seated as close to 7 as possible.We began with drinks - a margarita, jack and diet coke, pinot noir and ginger beer.  The drinks showed up mostly right, but the jack and diet arrived as a jack and water.  Not that big of a deal so we didn't say anything.  Apparently the Margarita was terrible.The atmosphere was nice.  We were seated in the vault which had about 6 tables.  Unfortunately they could not seem to get the music or the lighting correct.  During the course of our meal the lights would go down and then come back up.  The music would be at a reasonable volume and then wild become so loud you were shouting over it.Two of us ordered the scallops with pureed sugared pumpkin (not the name) and greens.  One ordered the filet that came with goat cheese potatoes and the other ordered the Turkey with gravy, potatoes and green beans.  I also ordered a side of the goat cheese potatoes.  When the plates of food arrived (minus the side we ordered) we all thought the food was average.  The steak was dry, the scallops were nothing special and the turkey was average.  The two of us who ordered the scallops thought the pumpkin concoction had a very odd flavor.  It took us through a quarter of our meal to get our waiters attention to tell him we never received our side.  He said ""Sure"" and walked off.  At least 5 minutes after I finished my meal the side finally arrived.  We were all finished at that point (not fast eaters), but I knew I would really like these potatoes so we ate them  I dare say these were the best part of our meal.  As the waiter was clearing our plates he cleared the table with the exception of my plates.  Our table was close to another table down in the vault and he would have had to walk around that table to get to my plates.  Instead of taking those few extra plates he leaned completely across the round table to take my plates.  Unprofessional for a waiter at this caliber a restaurant.Overall I was not impressed with this restaurant and have no plans to return the next time we are in NYC.  All in all this was a very average experience for a $230 dinner.  In my opinion there were many things about our experience that could have been improved.  it is unfortunate because this place has the potential to be very god.",0,0,0,alissa c.,"Arlington, VA",0,19,0
2.0,11/14/2010,"Stopped by the BWG the other night. The first thing I notice is that the place looks great, like some sort of swanky 1920's joint. Unfortunately, I get smacked in the face with lame music on the house speakers, specifically, late 80s Stevie Wonder, which tends to make me woozy. Also, literally, the room looks like its packed with Fox News anchor clones. Just horrendous.We had a 7:30 reservation. We arrived at 7:25 and were told to wait at the bar. A few drinks later, we're still waiting. The greeter was just plain rude, telling me that they were extremely busy and that there was nothing they could do. I guess reservation here doesn't mean they actually hold a table for you...you're just signaling your intent to want to eat about an hour or so after the time you booked the table for. As for the food, it was a mixed bag, ranging from sub-par to great. The we got the pumpkin ravioli which was Olive Gardeny and basic, as well as a lobster bisque which was OK, though nothing to write home about. For mains we got a blackened swordfish over a crab hash which was fair...the fish was way overcooked and dry, though the hash was tasty. We also got the ""Fedexed fresh to BWG"" King Crab legs which were good, and the big eye tuna was rather outstanding.Some other miscellaneous stuff that caught my attention:The men's bathroom is TINY and they stuff a surly attendant in there who's right on top of you. Awkward. The drinks at the bar were quite watered down for the prices they charge. The place is effin LOUD! Holy crap, between Stevie singing ""Part Time Lover"" at full volume and the smarmy patrons yakking away, I couldn't hear someone across the table from me.In the end, it was about $50 a head not including tip and drinks.

4.0,9/6/2010,"Seafood and fish heaven- very fresh, expertly prepared, pricy and worth it. I had the maki roll special (which was terrific- but who needs a mayo/mustard sauce with a maki roll?) with ""never frozen, first catch alaskan king crab legs"" (according to the waiter).  He was right.  The crab was the sweetest crab I have ever eaten- it didn't need any drawn butter or lemon, which would have masked the succulent gift of the sea that was on the plate in front of me.  AHHHH.   But at one half pound for $28 I was definitely paying for my own gift. However, the crab was sooo tender and flavorful that I didn't care about the price or that the noise level was a little high, or that the side veg of spinach was a little too salty.   I won't do this often, but I was very glad I came.Finished the meal with a white peach sorbet that was the essence of summer- amazing.Attentive but not intrusive wait staff, beautiful old former bank building.  You may want to sit upstairs, perhaps it's quieter up there.  There are outside tables, but why get exhaust fumes on your gift from the sea?",0,0,0,Greg B.,"New York, NY",1,46,0
5.0,9/6/2010,"When a woman at the table next to yours faints and falls on your father's lap, then, upon regaining consciousness, pukes in the wine bucket before being carted off by medics, and you are still eating Lobster Mashed Potatoes, unshaken by the whole scenario, then you know you're in a special place. Any cuisine short of spectacular would have you contagiously vomiting at the whole debacle. But at Blue Water Grill, instead of barfin', I kept scarfin'.This is truly one of my favorite restaurants in New York. It's no secret establishment, no historical landmark, no cool new spot, no up-and-comer, no past-its-primer. No, it's an exceptional seafood establishment, yes, disguised as some sort of Gotham Steakhouse Lite. Most people seem to have an opinion about it, whether they've been here or not. As Blue Water Grill is part of the B.R. Guest family, the haters want to write this place off as a tourist destination. And I'll tell you that I've gotten my fair share of gift cards to the restaurant group and have spent my credit some place other than Blue Water Grill - twice. I won't make that mistake again.As for the food, well, I had a red snapper special here once, a dish served with white Caribbean shrimp, that was so delicious, to this day, I will periodically check the Blue Water Grill website in hopes it has made the menu. Sadly, it hasn't, but that won't stop me from trying again and again. Really, everything I've had here has been fantastic, fresh, and served with an air of old-school New York flair. If it's a romantic night out, look no further than the Jazz Room, which opens at 6PM daily - the conversation buzz of big parties that echoes throughout the main dining room is replaced with soft bass lines and the occasional hi-hat tap courtesy of the live band. As for the original fainting incident, the staff made sure to move our party of eight to another table immediately after the medics came, and gave us one of everything on the dessert menu, including drinks, all on the house. It wouldn't have taken the free course to make Blue Water Grill one of my favorite restaurants in the city, but, hey, a little Irish Coffee and Warm Molten Chocolate Cake never hurt.",6,14,7,Dan R.,"Brooklyn, NY",633,551,148

4.0,8/25/2010,"Went for Lunch today, someone else bought...thank god. This place reeks of  money and the crowd for lunch is a combination of the silver haired last gasp types and the curiously unhip business crew.  We started with the Calamari, (of course dear) and it was very well prepared in a garlic, not too spicy, asian inspired sauce. We had two orders and I almost licked the plate when it was gone. Good stuff. Then I had the Lobster and Shrimp sandwich,it's $19 dollars and 50 cents fella and it comes with potato chips....excuse me, eh hem, whenever you see the potato chips on a plate at a restaurant  you should know to buckle up because your about to be ripped off.  That said, the Sandwich is again very well prepared with an avocado and mayonnaise dressing. I think if you like lobster salad or shrimp salad this sandwich would be a favorite if not a grail. Finished with the Banana ice cream and caramelized tower. This dessert is a work of art, both for the eyes and the stomach. Simple yet so well orchestrated, executed and inspired. The ice cream, chocolate and whipped cream and Banana's dance joyfully about your tongue and just when the thought of sitting down the caramel sweeps you off your feet again.  Yeah, this place is not cheap, and yeah it's pretty good fare for the fare!!",0,0,0,Joey C.,"New York, NY",3,60,10

If you want to take a girl on a date and impress her, this is probably the best you are going to do with out having to put on a jacket. Putting on a jacket to eat food just sucks IMO.The bar isn't a total rip-off and you will probably be waiting at least a little while before you are seated, so a drink or two isn't a bad idea. Once you sit down there is always something good on the menu which changes constantly. The one thing that stays the same is the raw sea food, which is pretty awesome. Also, the lobster shrimp spring rolls have been there the last 6 or 7 times I have been there so I don't think those go away either, and the hot spring rolls are good to have along with some chilled seafood.For dinner I would always have to go with the specials. Anything with Halibut is great there, I have never been disappointed with the Halibut, and the Asian Glazed Salmon they usually have served with the sticky rice is also good. The desserts are hit or miss, I have been blown away by some of their homemade ice creams and cakes, other times I just leave it to melt. My biggest complaint with them is that they eliminated their seafood pizza. Shrimp and Crab meat on flat bread, with a little dressing, it was one of my favorite appetizers ever, apparently it didn't sell enough and they pulled it off. They put lobster slider in their place, which in a place that should be able to do a good job with something like a lobster slider, did nothing but disappoint me.Still definitely worth $100-$150 you will spend for two people, every once in a while.

4.0,7/31/2010,"My husband and I went here for 2010 Summer Restaurant Week and I was pleasantly surprised by how much I liked it. I wasn't too sure at first, as it's a bit old school as far as the decor and service is concerned (not that it's necessarily a bad thing, it's just not my cup of tea). Our waiter was extremely friendly, though, and was quite attentive throughout the evening. The restaurant was full of hustle and bustle, but that's to be expected, as it is a very visible restaurant in the heart of Union Square. I ordered the sashimi for the appetizer, which was very, very fresh and a delight to eat. My husband got the gazpacho with shrimp, and this was the only sore spot in the meal, as there were only two small shrimp in what was a giant bowl of chilled, much too sweet gazpacho with some kind of strange, stringy noodles clumped together at the bottom of the bowl. It was just conceptually a strange dish to serve, especially with a spoon (how are you supposed to eat long, thin noodles with a spoon?). Either way, for the main course, I got the pork loin with lovely summer cherries and my husband got the cod. My pork loin was cooked beautifully, which is a hard thing to do in my opinion because it can dry out so easily. The cherries complimented the pork really well and I enjoyed every bite. My husband's cod was also cooked very well and was drizzled with a delectable sauce that enhanced every aspect of the fish. For dessert, I got a blueberry meringue while my husband got the chocolate and caramel torte, both of which were very good, but I much preferred mine because of the plump, fresh blueberries.

For entree, I ordered the soft shell crab and my friends ordered the blackened swordfish and the grilled scallops and shrimps. I did not taste their dishes, although I tried the sweet potato sauce and it was excellent. Both friends said they liked their dishes. My soft-shell crab was about average. I liked the edamame vinaigrette and the cabbage mix with shitake mushrooms, but the crab itself was nothing special. They gave us small pieces of cheesecake as we were about to pay. It was a very nice gesture, and the cheesecake was creamy, but I felt that I've had better. I think that eventually I would like to return and try the other dishes and see if I can find something tastier.",1,0,0,James K.,"El Cerrito, CA",247,497,166

3.0,6/9/2010,"Blue Water Grill is one of BR Guest's places, so you can always rely on the food being good and the price being a little high. But when I am going to pay $200 (w/ tip) for a two-person meal, I just expect more. The service is OK, but they definitely have room to improve. I would recommend sitting downstairs, especially on whatever nights they have live jazz---the upstairs is just kind of bland and a little cramped (thinking about it, I guess the entire restaurant is cramped).Food-wise, the seafood is always a good bet, and their sushi rolls are great. I'd say the oysters were great there last week, but I don't know if I should thank the fisherman or the restaurant ha. I had the soft-shell crab most recently and enjoyed it, but definitely would just go for an unfried fish dish next time----the halibut is sensational. Drinks are strong but the glasses are on the smaller side. Not a fantastic whiskey selection by any means.Come to think of it, I am not so sure the next time I will go back to BWG. There are just so many other seafood restaurants in the city that are better --- even BR Guest's own Ocean Grill on the Upper West is a better bet (spacious and great food!).",1,0,0,Dustin K.,"Queens, NY",28,254,4
4.0,6/8/2010,"The Blue Water Grill was brought to life in a converted bank, just like NOPA in San Francisco yelp.com/biz/nopa-san-fr… .  The establishment puts on a good show and tries to promote happy times.  The jazz ensemble helps, if you're not sitting too close to it.  This is a large, loud place with hosts and managers walking around with earpieces that look like those warn by Secret Service agents.  The whole experience is somewhat managed, which for me is a negative point when I try to evaluate restaurants.  I'm generally more attracted to small places where the chef-owner makes occasional appearances in the dining room in his white kitchen outfit.I liked both of my courses: the yellowfin tuna sashimi appetizer and the local cod special main dish.  In both cases, I found the portions to be a little small.  The ""sashimi"" was a salad of sorts with avocado, citrus, spices -- and the occasional piece of tuna.  The cod came with a corn-based salsa that had a few pieces of chorizo in it.  Both were very good dishes, but I do wish that there were more on my plate.The wine list was pretty interesting.  We settled for a 2008 Bruno Giacosa, Roero Arneis, which was listed @ $62; I saw the 2007 last summer on the French Laundry wine list for $120!  (No, I've never been to the French Laundry, but a friend emailed me the wine list to ask for advice in ordering ahead for his kid!)  The Arneis was good enough that we went ahead and ordered a second bottle after the first one had been drained.  Before we settled on the Bruno Giacosa wine, we were tempted by a catarratto for $35.  Catarrattos are interesting, but they tend to sell for under $10 in wine stores; somehow I thought it would be a better strategy to go for a more expensive wine with a smaller percentage markup.",0,0,0,Kenneth R.,"Berkeley, CA",914,1303,241

We didn't get ""down in the Treme"" but was a light, jazz ""dinner"" music. The restaurant is dark and would be great for a date or to take ""out-of-towners"".Initially, service was great but when downhill shortly thereafter.We had one doz oysters split between kumamoto & shinbudo (?) which were great. Split the lobster mash which was to-die-for!! For our entrees I had the sea bass which I lovingly consumed. I think I licked my plate clean!  On the other hand, my friend ordered the salmon, picked her sauce & side. What she got was the salmon special which was not even close to the one she ordered. She ate the salmon but left the cucumber, apricot sauce and hummus (totally weird).  Btw--the salmon was supposed to be ""wild"" but I believe it was farm raised. When the sever came around (five years later, mind you) my friend explained that her entree was incorrect which the server was apologetic about. To compensate for the oversight,  we both received a glass of desert rose wine to drink during our desert of rhubarb crumble which was fantastic!!While there was one slight mishap, I would definitely come back.

5.0,4/26/2010,"I love Blue Water Grill.  I planned a green event in NYC and was initially drawn to BWG because it was certified green by the Green Restaurant Association.  The meal was so delightful, I'm going green dining more often!The Food - One of the best seafood dishes I've had in awhile.  I ordered the Ginger-Soy Lacquered Chilean Sea Bass...it sounded like my dream meal when I saw it on the menu and it exceeded my expectations.  As mentioned in other reviews, it literally melts in your mouth.  And my fellow dinner companions were equally gushing over their entrees.  Dessert was almost as mouth-watering; I opted for the Apple Crumble, which came with a cute little carafe of gooey, thick caramel sauce...absolute deliciousness and I loved the presentation!  Another dessert highlight was the Caramelized Banana Ice Cream Tower - it was an impressive display and completely devoured.The Service - The hostesses were extremely accommodating when I called a few times prior to the event to modify the number of guests.  They also expressed no reservations about being able to serve 15 guests in a timely manner without preselecting a menu (other restaurants aren't always this accommodating, so BWG's flexibility was definitely a bonus).  Our servers were attentive and personable, contributing to an overall pleasant, fun evening.The Atmosphere - The restaurant, which used to be a bank, is open, yet intimate.  The main dining area boasts high ceilings and the red chandeliers add a touch of romance and swank without overdoing it.  I came here for a business dinner, but will absolutely go back with friends and try the downstairs jazz dining room and outdoor café.",3,0,0,Janice B.,"Boston, MA",9,2,0

Just a hunk of tuna in some vegetables and an uninspired hot and sour sauce. The risotto was a tiny portion with a little too much cream and bits of crayfish and chorizo mixed in, and a few shrimp.

We arrived about ten minutes late for our reservation and did have to suffer the consequences of waiting for another ten minutes before being seated.  But there was plenty of seating in the lobby, and we could have gotten a drink at the bar.  Our table was on the main dining floor, near one of the large windows (which are famously open during the summer months).  There seemed to be more seating areas upstairs and downstairs.  The server was fantastic...she made the best recommendations!  For the appetizer I had the Clams Casino, and my entree was Slow Roasted Gooseberry Cove Cod  with Braised Short Rib Risotto, Baby Spinach in a Pomegranate Reduction.  Oh my goodness, this meal was to die for!  I ate every single bite!  Dessert, since I'm kind of boring, was a selection of sorbets, but they really were a nice finish to the meal.  I would love to go back to Blue Water Grill on a date.  It's also a great place to bring your parents (take note, NYU students who dorm in the Union Square area) when they are paying the bill.",1,0,0,Krista J.,"Brooklyn, NY",749,1181,35
5.0,2/10/2010,"Blue Water Grill is a solid American restaurant and is one of my personal favorites. Every experience here has been enjoyable. Whenever I have guests staying over I always recommend Blue Water Grill. The restaurant itself is very beautiful. It's sophisticated, yet not too formal. I actually like to dine on the second floor because its like a little getaway - like you're eating in a small, intimate restaurant. I usually order the lobster and shrimp sandwich for lunch and the Chilean sea bass when I come for dinner. The lobster and shrimp sandwich has a really nice flavor, though sometimes I wish they left out the shrimp and just made it a lobster sandwich - even if it does mean raising the price a bit. What I love about the sandwich is that they add avocado and bacon, two of my favorite toppings. The avocado adds to the creaminess of the lobster and shrimp meat while the bacon adds that crisp. Their Chilean sea bass is among the best Chilean sea bass I've had. It literally melts in your mouth and is served with rice and kai lan, or Chinese broccoli. The ginger-soy sauce adds a nice, almost sweet flavor to the delicate fish.If you're looking for a nice place to go on a date or unwind at the end of the day, Blue Water Grill is great pick.",1,0,1,Lawrence L.,"New York, NY",5,49,0

4.0,2/5/2010,"Last night I came to Blue Water Grill for Restaurant Week with a friend of mine. I hadn't been planning on going to any more restaurants for Restaurant Week but since she suggested it, who was I to decline. I remembered that Blue Water Grill was one of the more popular places that everyone seemed to want to go to. Therefore I wasn't surprised when the only available reservation slot was 6:15pm. Quite an early dinner but I'm not complaining. At least parking permits are not in effect starting from 6pm.So after parking the car, I headed over to meet my friend over at the restaurant. The first thing I noticed while being led to our reserved table was that all the diners seemed to be dressed in business attire with suits, ties, slacks, dresses, etc. I made a joke while walking that we'd be put in a corner in the back of the restaurant because we were in casual dress. Well low and behold, guess where we were seated. A corner in the back. Next to us was a couple who were the only other people in the entire space that I noticed were also wearing jeans. I felt like we were kind of forgotten about back there. The waiter would disappear for long periods of time between getting out drink order, serving us water, taking our order, etc. To be honest I still don't know which one exactly was our waiter.Anyway, we got settled in and ordered from the Restaurant Week menu. I ordered the Wild Mushroom Consommè as an appetizer, the Faroe Islands Sea Trout as the entrée and the Chocolate Butterscotch Tart for dessert. My friend had the Baked Littleneck Clams ""Casino"" for the appetizer, the Slow Roasted Gooseberry Cove Cod for the entrée and the Citrus Cheesecake for dessert. The broth in the Wild Mushroom Consommè was a little on the salty side. The toasted barley in the dish was a little on the chewy side. I tried one of my friend's clams and it was so delicious. It had a strong bacon flavor to it and aioli mixture melded with the bacon and the clam to create an explosion of flavor. I wanted to lick it and suck on it but that might have been going overboard. My Faroe Islands Sea Trout came out looking and tasting more like salmon. I realize that they are actually in the same family of fish but I expected there to be some difference. The Gooseberry Cove Cod also came out resembling a filet of tilapia. My friend claimed that it looked like a tilapia and had the taste and texture of a fluke. Finally came the dessert, my favorite part. Ill start off with my friend's Citrus Cheesecake. It was a definite pass in my opinion. Citrus and cheesecake just does not work together for me. The citrus sorbet is came with was passable I suppose, but only by itself. My Chocolate Butterscotch Tart however was so delicious. The toffee chip ice cream was so creamy and the toffee chips added a nice crunch. There was a stick of what I assume was a chocolate mousse that was also very rich a decadent. The tart itself was a bit hard but once in my mouth is just melted away. Yum.After reading the menu online, I was a little hesitant on coming to Blue Water Grill for Restaurant Week. The menu just didn't appeal to me as opposed to some other places. In the end it wasn't bad. The food was passable on the most past. This place does seem pretty popular so I guess now I can say that I've had it and I can recommend a very good dessert too! Chocolate Butterscotch Tart.. mMmm..",6,3,5,P C.,"Brooklyn, NY",235,206,145

I liked this trout, it was different that other trouts I've had cause it was salmon-like. The skin was perfectly crisp and it had a lot of flavor.

4.0,1/26/2010,"Lately, I've found myself very pleasantly surprised.  Case in point: Sushi Samba.  The last time I had dined at the chain's Park Avenue location (or any of their NYC locations, for that matter) was sometime in July...of 2006.  And honestly, post moijito #2, I don't remember too much about that meal.  After nearly four years, I returned to Sushi Samba in early January for dinner with my friend, Michelle.  Everything we ordered, from the rolls and Peruvian corn, to the dessert, was really fresh and delicious.  This left me wondering why so many New Yorker's dog this place.  Is it because the rolls are stuffed with prissy ingredients like lobster tempura?  Sushi Samba may not be the most authentic option in town, but who cares?  Does thoroughly enjoying a tropical rum-based cocktail (with or without one of those paper umbrellas), a bowl of salty edamame and a lobster-tempura roll make someone any less of a foodie?  Hell no.  And to anyone who thinks it does, well, get the F over yourself.And speaking of pleasant surprises, I recently had an excellent brunch experience at Blue Water Grill that I can't stop gushing about!  Now, given BWG's (Blue Water Grill) heavy tourist-traffic location in Union Square, its massive physical space, and the shear fact that it's owned by hospitality giant, B.R. Guest, I automatically wrote the restaurant off, assuming that the food would only be mediocre, at best.Upon being seated, Emily and I were presented with a basket filled with moist breakfast breads and a ramekin of fragrant strawberry-butter.After perusing the bountiful menu, I ultimately chose the Lobster Benedict for my entree.  A large plate arrived with two thick slices of toasted lemon-pepper brioche (bread) that were each topped with a mound of steamed spinach, a perfectly-poached egg and a generous helping of warm hollandaise sauce.  Sauteed home fries (potatoes) and approximately eight-ounces of the freshest lobster meat this side of the Cape sat alongside the Benedict.  ""Psssssh, I'll eat half of the food on this plate and then hit the gym.  I won't blow my diet,"" I said to myself.  Unfortunately, after one bite, it became very clear to me that in order to only consume 50% of my meal, I'd have to plan an exit strategy.  But what excuse could I use to leave the table?  I quickly decided that I was too tired and hungry to conjure up some stupid scheme.  And before I knew it, my entire meal had vanished before my very eyes; finding a nice little hiding place in my stomach.  Honestly, had Emily not slapped me after my first attempt, I would have licked that entire plate clean.From its central and easily-accessible location, fabulous interior space that's well suited for patrons of all ages, and delicious food/drink, I wouldn't hesitate in calling BWG a ""brunch destination.""",0,0,1,Lindsay F.,"New York, NY",376,277,184
4.0,1/25/2010,"This review pertains to brunch because that's all I know about this place.They offer live jazz brunch (starts at 1130 on the lower floor) which is pretty unique.  They also have no music brunch on the main floor. Food is fresh and brunch comes with a free hot bev and alcoholic drink.  If you forgo the ""still"" and ""sparkling"" waters ($8 a pop), your brunch with live jazz, booze and coffee (and of course some food...I got an omelette which was standard tasty) would set you back about $15-16.  It's not a cheapie brunch but at a place like this with live music it is a sweet deal IMHO (in my humble opinion). The place itself is a bit stuffy (marble columns, uniformed waitstaff, actually use real tablecloth) and the clientele tends to be in the 40 and older set with a smattering of peeps in their 20-30s.  Overall it's a good place to take a small group of friends or your parents or in laws or clients or those who like certain accoutrements like tablecloth, fresh flowers, uniforms and such.  Staff are friendly too.",0,0,0,PM o.,"New York, NY",4,40,0
3.0,1/25/2010,"I have been hearing great things about the Blue Water Grill for a hot minute so on my birthday decided  eat there for my birthday.  well, it was actually a surprise, since it was my birthday. Well, my gf had been telling me for sometime that they have the best friend calamari EVER. So I order that as an apetizer, and i LOVE calamari. Well, it was good. REALLY good. Here's the problem. They serve it to you with a big bunch of leafy greens and you have to pretty much search through the green stuff to find the calamari. After you're done, you realize you didn't get much calamari. For the price, we paid I should have been quite please. BWG is already messing with me. So we had reservations, and then they sit us at this crappy table, where everyone that passes the table bumps my chair, so I'm already pissed.I ordered a seafood platter and my gf ordered the mashed potatoes and the chicken. I don't know what was wrong wit the chicken, but it seemed a bit rubbery. The whole nite was jokes that we were eating beaks, ligaments and tendons. The seafood platter kinda sucked too. it was lobster, shrimp, oysters, in some pan over some kind of yellow rice. The yellow rice was horrible, as I realized I started to eat around it. Looks like something your college buddies would have made, but you'd be willing to eat it on a drunk-nite with some cut-up hot dogs. Never done that, but i'm sure you catch my drift.Worse part of all, after we left the restaurant, we were still hungry. I gotta give this place three stars because I would't go back ... not on my dime least.  If I lived in Backwater Texas or sumthin, I'd probably go here more...But there are too many GREAT restaurants in Manhattan I would rather try then come bach here. As somebody said here, this place is just not worthy of their prices. They had 3 tries to get it right and failed at everyone with 2 entrees and an apatezier.

5.0,1/21/2010,"Excellent experience here - highly recommend and I plan on returning. I went for the first time to celebrate my birthday after wanting to go for quite some time. As ambiance/atmosphere is crucial for my dining experience, this place nailed it. There's so many places in the city, but the majority are rather cramped and ""cozy"". This place had a welcoming feel but in a huge space. We sat upstairs on the second floor so we could overlook the rest of the place. (I hear the jazz downstairs is great, so I'll have to come back and sit down there). The place is perfect for an intimate evening with a date or a larger group as we were (went with my family). The service was excellent, very attentive and friendly waiter. I was trying to decide between two wines and he brought me a sample of both which was nice. Last but not least, the food: Apps: Shared the calamari and I tasted some of the lobster bisque. I loved the calamari. Just keep in mind It's a little different than how it's usually served. There's a sweet/sour glaze on top of it and there's cooked onions and carrot shavings mixed in, so it's more of a salad; but definitely a wonderful dish. The bisque was also delicious, it tastes extremely fresh, it's flavorful, and just the right consistency.Entrees: I ordered their signature dish, the Chilean Sea Bass. It's definitely the best I've had. The wasabi glaze sauce or whatever it was is like nothing you've had and unforgettable. It's mixed in with the spinach. The fish itself had a lot of flavor and was cooked flawlessly. I also had a taste of the shrimp/scallop dish which was also very flavorful. Everyone else said they enjoyed their meals.

The restaurant, a converted bank, is hip, but not overly so with high ceilings and a festive atmosphere. It is a crowd pleaser from a date to your parents.

Not being able to decide on a wine, I opted for a reasonable Sangiovese by the glass.For food, the lobster bisque with lobster beignets was great.  Nice smooth flavor with the lobster beignets as a bit of variety and diffferent texture.  I also loved the blackened swordfish with sweet potato and crab hash and sauce.   It was fantastic. I loved the contrast of flavors and textures.  The swordfish was cooked nicely and it was huge portion.  The Chilean seabass was also good, but I thought the swordfish was more creative.  By the time we got dessert, I was already stuffed.  But, I managed to  find room for the enormous banana tower.  The tower is enough for two people.  It has yummy caramelized bananas, banana ice cream, and whipped cream held together in a wafer and surrounded by marshmallow and chocolate sauce.  Decadent yes.  When we got the check, I had to be rolled out of there.",0,0,0,Jasmine M.,"Manhattan, NY",160,364,0

This roll gets its spice from fresh jalepeno rather than a gooey sauce which I really appreciated.  For entrees, my BF had the blackened swordfish which came with a rich sweet potato and crab meat sauce. I could have drank a soup dish full of that suace! The fish was meaty and cooked to perfection, flaking apart at the touch of a fork. I had the chilean sea bass in a ginger wasabi sauce.  The piece of fish was again pristine and the taste was clean and fresh.  The service was friendly and attentive.  When we had to remind our server we'd ordered a second glass of prosseco, she gave it to us free as well as a little complimentary dessert- small chocolate cookies which provided just enough sweet to satisfy me.  We were continuing on to a night of drinking and chose to skip dessert, but the menu looked great and I would return to try it out.Overall a lovely experice- I will certainly return and highly reccoment BWG!",0,0,0,Kathryn M.,"Las Vegas, NV",5,31,0

You really can't go wrong with oysters at Blue Water Grill!Both of us also ordered the Chicken Cobb salad and it was on the money. The grilled chicken was moist. We left satisfied and full.The only minor complaint was that due to every table filled, service was not in top shape. I had to ask for oyster forks and then small plates. I was also surprised the waiter didn't offer fresh ground pepper when giving us our salads, and we had to keep asking for water refills.

Could not find a think on the RW menu that was appealing to me, so I went for the A la carte.  I think I should mention they wedged us into a table maybe inches between other diners on both the left and right side of our table.  This place IS NOT intimate at all, and you better hope the person next to you does not spill their drink or you will be wearing it too.My dining companion and I started with a shared App which was the shrimp dumplings.  Came out hot but were disappointing as far as dumplings go (maybe im a snob), but we were hungry so we made quick work of them.Entrees: I went with the Seafood Paella.  Shrimp, Clams, mussels, and chicken were evident if not slightly over done. The lobster, calamari, and chorizo seemed to be little to non existent.  The rice was well cooked, but lacked that bold flavor that I was hoping for.  This was average paella at best.  GF went with the halibut or cod (aren't all white fish the same?)  This was good; it had some sort of pesto sauce that was actually quite palatable.Skipped dessert.Overall an average at best seafood experience, even with the RW deal, I can think of a multitude of seafood places throughout the city that I would rather eat at than BWG.  Too bad too because I love the managements other restaurant (Dos Caminos).",0,0,0,Jack G.,"Westchester, NY",3,9,0

The decision to dine there is rarely mine but I never complain when the choice is made. Why? Well, Blue Water has a number of characteristics that bring real praise. Decor is lovely and the service is surprisingly efficient and friendly. The lunch choices are vast. Dependable appetizers, good salads and a large array of sushi from which to choose. Main courses have been more hit and miss for me but a simple grilled fillet (mahi mahi or swordfish) does me right. As someone mentioned earlier, the biggest detraction is that there just isn't that ""wow factor"" that one gets from comparably priced destinations. Me thinks it has something to do with BWG being part of a larger restaurant empire. I think that sucks a bit of the soul out of the place hence diminishing the diner's experience. What is gained in consistency is lost with lack of the unexpected. BWG is a solid option where I will undoubtedly return (on someone else's dime).",0,0,0,Andy G.,"Austin, TX",20,103,0

The hubby and I shared the following: BBQ Eel Roll (Crispy Shiitake, Cucumber, Chipotle Teriyaki) - Just OK to me... Filet Mignon Roll (Grilled Portobello, Thai Dipping Sauce) - Sounds good but really not that great. Spicy Lobster & Tuna Roll (Avocado, Jalapeño, Cilantro Aioli) - I wasn't able to try this one myself but the hubby thought it was really good. Seafood Paella - Looked and smelled really good BUT it was just alright for me. VERY filling though... Most of the other people in our party seemed OK with their food. The seafood was definitely fresh but there just wasn't anything extraordinary about it. To end the dinner on a sweet note, we shared 2 orders of the Caramelized Banana Ice Cream Tower with 2 other couples. I'm a big fan of sweets so this was a THUMBS UP for me.

4.0,9/22/2009,"Missed the boat during Restaurant Week this year, but finally made my way to Blue Water Grill last night for dinner with a friend. This was a memorable experience from the ambiance, to the service to the food. Yes, it's a little bit pricey, but it's an unpretentiously swanky enough place which serves really good food to make it worth it's weight. We had the option of dining outside but decided to stay indoors b/c it was a little nippy. I wasn't too hungry so we shared only one appetizer and each got an entree, but ended without any dessert (travesty, I agree). So, the few items that were ordered proved to be quite good, actually make that great (they were the dumpling potstickers, and as entrees, the marvelously cooked and flavored, grilled Scottish salmon with spinach and raisins, and the sea bass). I regretted that we didn't try any of their sushi rolls or, again, the delectable-sounding desserts. I'm hoping to come back, maybe for the brunch experience to substantiate whether or not the rolls here are as good as other fellow yelpers have affirmed. Btw, our waiter, Trevor, was so delightful. He was friendly, but not in that glaringly obnoxious and plastic sort of way some waitstaff can be. Instead, he was so likable and attentive, while not being a pinch intrusive at all.  As a diner, I fell head over heels.  At the end of the night, I gave him some love on the post-dinner feedback card because he so deserved recognition for his professionalism and noteworthy service. The mood at Blue Water is pretty relaxed and laid-back. It was a little noisy with table chatter, but that only adds to the charm of the restaurant as diners all around us seemed to have been enjoying their company and food.",2,0,1,Jennifer C.,"Elmhurst, NY",559,645,1350

Score!! Our waiter was super nice and asked the chef if we could substitute the salmon on the main menu since I didn't like watermelon (which accompanied the salmon the RW menu).  Hubby ordered the ribs and fried chicken. I know (who orders ribs at a seafood place), but surprisingly the ribs were good.  The chicken was whatevs.  There was a side of mac n cheese that was yummy too.  For apps, the heirloom gazpacho soup was wonderful. Momma had the clams and she enjoyed them and hubby had a salad which was so so.  As for the dessert, the sorbets were standard, but some pie sort of dessert (forgot what it was), was pretty good.All in all, we thought it was a good value.  We also ordered a bottle of wine and it was only $35.

Might I add, the bread basket is a treat!- a mix of pumpkin cake and walnut raisin bread w/ strawberry cream cheese. The egg benedicts here steal the limelight- the lobster benedict  is a crowd pleaser (although i do wish they would add more lobster) Normally, I get the regular benedict with canadian bacon and ask for toasted brioche instead of the english muffin- topped with creamy hollandaise sauce--so yummy!

I realize that we're in a recession and all, but is it really necessary for them to push us to get bottles of wine and dessert/coffee just because it looks like we are on a business lunch??Notes on the food:-the crispy Thai calamari wasn't crispy -- I don't know what happened, but it somehow became soggy from the point that it got fried and got to our table. That was a little disappointing. The big-eye tuna nachos were surprisingly tasty, as were the shrimp and lobster spring rolls, but the Maryland crab cake was incredibly tiny and at $12 felt like a bit of a rip.For my entree, I had the Maine lobster and shrimp sandwich, which actually wasn't as great as I thought it would be. I felt like there wasn't enough lobster, and the lime vinaigrette though light just wasn't terribly appetizing. The worst part about the sandwich was the bread -- a soft, ordinary bun that didn't have too much character at all. The one big piece of bacon in the sandwich was good, though. I also had a lavender raspberry lemonade, which was really refreshing. It's a good non-alcoholic drink to pick for a hot summer day like it was that day I was there. Looking at what my dining mates had ordered, I wish I'd ordered the sushi rolls. They looked amazing and were pretty big, too.

4.0,7/2/2009,"Aesthetically, this place is great.  If you're looking for a quiet, relaxed restaurant this is certainly not it.  But I love the grandeur of the place, and the fact that it's bustling makes it a great place to have dinner on a Friday or Saturday night before heading out.  I've sat upstairs, which can get a bit tight, but one time I sat along the perimeter so I had a great view of the street which was perfect.  I've also sat in the jazz room downstairs, which is a bit more ""intimate"" if you will, it's more of a soothing vibe (the jazz music sets the tone).  I'd sit downstairs with your significant other, upstairs if you're out with a bunch of friends for the night.Food.  I love seafood.  If you don't,  this might be a good play to try seafood, because it's very good and aside from the raw bar, a lot of the dishes are spicy, which takes some of the ""fishiness"" out of it.  The Crispy Thai Calamari is a definite must for an appetizer.  I love this dish!  The sushi here is OK, but not my favorite.  The Monster Roll (Tuna) is good, and while I appreciate the amount of food in the roll, sushi rolls should not be the circumference of The Moon.  It is an uncomfortable situation for all parties involved, and I get nervous with how to approach such a monstrosity without looking like a complete slob.  I wasn't a huge fan of the coconut shrimp roll, but I am partial to spicy as opposed to sweet.  This coconut sauce was on the sweet side.The only entree I have tried (I went with sushi the first) was the Chilean Sea Bass which was amazing.  Two other people I went with on separate occasions ordered the blackened swordfish and said it was amazing.Drink wise- they used to have this amazing ginger beer cocktail (the name escapes me).  I loved that.  Ginger anything paired with spicy seafood is just a great idea and should never have been taken off the menu, but it changes all of the time.  I also liked the peartini.  I hear brunch is very good there as well and plan on going soon.I'd give it 5 stars if it weren't for some particularly large rolls and the missing ginger-based cocktail.",0,0,0,Kate O.,"New York, NY",143,16,0

You practically had to shout! And the food wasn't that great. We ordered a platter from the raw bar for the table, and that was actually pretty good. Oh the oysters... delish! But the food thereafter left much to be desired. It was too salty/peppery, the general seasoning wasn't that great, the swordfish was dry... the general seasoning and food preparation was just not at all what I expected it to be, not at all worth the price. I went here for my birthday with my family, and I ordered swordfish and lobster bisque, tried my mother's soft shell crab, and tried my sister's steak. None of it impressive. My Dad complained that his salad and seafood paella were too salty. The desserts (I had the chocolate fondue) were so painfully average as well. None of the five of us were very impressed.

Yesterday's dinner prompted me to write a review. The cherrystones and oysters were inconsistent and still had some rock salt with shell residue. The oysters were almost micro sized and shouldn't be served- they looked like raisins.  The chilean sea bass was cooked perfectly, but ruined by the overpowering sauce. The soft shell crab tasted like airplane food and was soggy to say the least. Everything also seems as if they have gone through a shrink ray.

The most surprising part of our visit was the service. The staff was nice enough, but they seemed badly short-handed. About 15 minutes after we sat down, we STILL didn't have any water, had to get up and ask for it myself. Then after we finished our salads, it was another 20-25 minutes before we got our entrees.

And I didn't drink so it goes to show you how unmemorable my meal was.

The calamari appetizer was unique, I eat a lot of calamari and it's usually just your standard deep-fried batter, but this particular appetizer was prepared slightly differently, with a spicy/ sweet sauce accompanying the dish. Yum!The prices are kind of high... always at least $40 a person, if you get an entree and share an appetizer, and even more if you drink... but the food and the atmosphere is totally worth it.

Both times we went, the waiter was able to recommend dishes for us, and if asked, they would also recommend how to cook the fish or steak. The food is very good. The menu does not vary much, but I guess, they don't have to change much if they found a winning formula. Every now and then, depending on season, they may swap in and out one or two items on the menus. We normally get some items from the raw bar, an appetizer, entrees and dessert. The raw food is fresh and great. We;ve had sushi rolls here too. The raw fish was fresh and delicious. For the appetizers we have tried the calamari and spring rolls. Both are highly recommended.

3.0,3/4/2009,"We made a reservation for Blue Water Grill at about 10 am, for a party of 7 at 11:30 am, that same morning, I was sure we wouldn't get a reservation but the hostess was helpful.  She guaranteed us a round table, and told us we would be in the downstairs in the Jazz brunch area.  When asked if it was loud we were told it was only ""background music"".  Note: NEVER sit downstairs with a group during the Jazz brunch, it's way too loud!  We couldn't hear across the table at noon with very few people in the restaurant.The interior of BWG is very nice.  I have been upstairs for dinner, and thought that the layout was a bit average, but still pleasant.  The vault downstairs in really pretty though, they have a great round table, great mirrors on the walls, and overall it's a very nice space.  The service was appalling.  Our waiter seemed upset with every question we asked and every drink we ordered.  All I wanted to say was, ""Hey dude, you're a waiter, this is your job!  If you didn't feel like serving people you probably shouldn't have become a waiter!""  The food overall was pretty mediocre.  I had a seafood cobb salad that had more egg and bacon than greens and seafood.  The bellini had way more schnapps than champagne and they only offer strawberry butter with their bread...I'm not a fan and my boyfriend is allergic!   The bread really ended up being the tastiest part of the meal -- try the banana bread, you won't be disappointed.Final Analysis:From what I have heard I need to try the sushi, everyone says it's really good and I would definitely consider going back to try it.  But for brunch it's just not worth it.  I have had better food at cheaper places with waiters who are friendly and music that you can actually speak over and for a relaxing Sunday brunch that is exactly what I am looking for.  I would  probably still, after this rave review :), recommend trying BWG once.  But I am guessing that the stock / chain restaurant quality food and terrible customer service will deter you from returning.",3,1,2,Leah B.,"New York, NY",46,18,0

I devoured this only finding myself hoping for more :(2) The creme brulee was good, a 4 stars good but nothing to make it stand out than creme brulees at other restaurant.3) Service was subpar. Once again as a successful manhattan eatery all the waiters were experienced and knew what they were doing.Last but not least, I highly recommend a private work function here.( Yep, those that the company pays for!!!)

Did not see any foam but had a thin white sauce. We only got 2 scallops but others got 3. Maybe they go by weight?-Bouillabaisse - Average had some clams, mussels, shrimp, potatoes. If they had a good bread basket it would be great to dunk with. But their bread was cold and tough.-Mocha Torte - Not good. Was almost rubbery.-Winter Fruits Sorbet - Not good. This was very sour and had lots of pulp in the fruit.-Lobster Mash Potato - Potato was not rich or creamy at all. It needed more milk or cream.

J. and I were planning on having a champagne brunch date after the epic success that was our Fleming's dinner date, but I was devastated to find out that the Blue Water Grill in Chicago has lost its lease and is now CLOSED! After crying about it to my boyfriend, he picked up my (not-so-subtle) signals and made reservations for the Blue Water Grill in NYC during my weekend visit (yay!) We sat in the downstairs jazz dining room, which featured live jazz and a darker, more intimate ambiance than upstairs. The service was great, and the food was very good as well--the complimentary glass of bellini can't be beat! (you can also choose to have a mimosa, champagne, campari, bloody mary, or screwdriver). I had the seafood quiche, which was standard, but the boyfriend's banana foster french toast was deeelicious!

4.0,1/14/2009,"Note: This review is written about my past experiences almost 3 months ago. I haven't been back there since, but do plan on it.My reservation was at 8. I heard you have to have one if you plan on going into this place. It's always packed. Just like how your wallet should be if you go here. But, it is romantic. It is nice. And the food is amazing.My date and I arrive on time. She's absolutely stunning and I feel a bit under-dressed as she's dawning a full black dress and I'm wearing just a button down. Upon arrival, we find that the crowd here looks upper class (some may call these people douches). All adults. No kids. It's dim, it's moody, and it smells good. The place is packed full of people who look pretentious. Great. What did I get myself into?We're ushered to the outside patio to our table where we look at the menu. It's a warm, breezy August night, and uncharacteristically not humid at this time of year. Great. I always ask for outside tables when taking a date out. Good thing I brought money. I was prepared to spend hundreds. Anything for her. Especially in that dress. Hah. We get a half bottle of Chardonay and sparkling water and continue browsing the menu.The service is great, something you'd expect from this sort of establishment. I don't have much to compare it to, but comparing it to the other places I've been, this is money well spent. We order an appetizer and we get sushi, which I was surprised to see on the menu. We get some crab legs if I remember correctly, and seared salmon. It's pot luck tonight so we both share. There's a candle on the table lighting up her face and I can see the twinkle in her eye. Man I'm way out of my league here...The food comes out smelling absolutely brilliant. We take turns taking bites and move on to feeding each other, taking sips of wine and exchanging funny and embarrassing stories. It's hard for me to take my eyes off of her, but I do sneak a peek here and there at my food. Man it's good. The sushi is plump and pregnant with loads of crab meat. The salmon is soft and juicy and breaks apart flake by flake in my mouth. The crab legs are a bit tricky to eat and not get messy (her idea! which I totally loved because it's good to get messy), were just as succulent and incredible as one would expect. I'm not sure if it's me or if it's Blue Water Grill, but by now I can tell my date is totally into me. And now as I'm writing this 3 months later, I can't believe I haven't been back (hah!). Either way, we're both stuffed and there's a good amount of food left on the table. But we just sit there. And we talk. And we laugh. And we people watch. And we continue flirting nonchalantly. The waitress is very patient and understanding. She continues to serve us, even though we've declined dessert (since we're going elsewhere for that). She's going to get a fat tip. About 10 minutes pass by with our aimless conversations when a man with roses walks up to the railing where we are sitting. He compliments my date and how beautiful she is, and hands her a rose. She looks at me as if to ask if it's okay to take, and I smile back, as if to say she could have the world if she wanted to. The dark red compliments her beautiful tan complexion. She's absolutely incredible. I tip the man and he goes on his merry way, and by then I've paid the check and we're ready for dessert... a pint of ice cream back at my place.Thank you BWG.",1,2,2,Bryan L.,"Brooklyn, NY",364,19,0
1.0,1/12/2009,"Blue Water Grill is Crowded, overpriced, and the food is nothing, you can get for Half the price in Queens. The portions were very small to be honest,.. I left Hungry. My Friends and I spent over 300 bucks and left hungry. Afterward we went to Brooklyn to SEA in Willamsburg and got the same items for 1/5 the price and cooked even better.I would not recommend BWG . Better to save your cash and go anywhere else.On Another note I have found out the owners of BWG don't pay the jazz musicians what they should so if you see them please tip them. They also will charge the spouse of the musicians a drink to sit there. This makes this place all the more wack.Plus I hear they charge the musicians who play Jazz there to drink and eat.

This i find unacceptable from a restaurant with such a high presentation.  Most of the dishes were pleasant but not the quality i have found elsewhere.  Ive had much better seafood dish experience at other places where they put more attention to  food quality than the look of the restaurant.  Prices are a bit on the higher end for the quality they are serving.

2.0,9/30/2008,"We went on a Monday night, so seating was not really an issue ... even without reservations. We were sent downstairs, which was a pleasant suprise because of the live jazz. However, were sat in a corner where you could not really see the musicians, not a huge deal. The ambiance was nice, but nothing special. I would say the same of the decor. Nice idea not expertly executed; then again, the food is what is important. My fiancee had the lobster bisque which had a real hardy taste. I had their special of the day, a butternut squash with cherries soup that was tasty. For the entrees, she had the Scottish Salmon and I had the Pecan Crusted Corvina. Both dishes were fine, but definitely not special. There were a lot of flavors that seemed to be competing with one another in each dish, but making the dishes seem like they were trying to hard.For dessert, I had a Coconut Creme Brulee which came with a couple of pineapple slices and a coconut macaroon. Once again, it felt like a dish that was trying too hard; it wasn't bad, just okay. We are very unlikely to return. We feel there's too many places to explore in the city, and Blue Water Grill does not seem to hold any promise.",3,0,1,Ariel J.,"New York, NY",32,79,34

The drumm was savory and light, like a red snapper, and the gnocchi were like chocolate bonbons - I couldn't stop eating them.

5.0,8/21/2008,"I'm not known for my ability to do things in moderation, so dining out at places like Blue Water Grill can be very dangerous for me.  Last Thursday night was no exception--I stuffed myself silly with a delicious array of foods from expertly prepared sushi to the pistachio-crusted something-or-other (South American white fish) special to samples of Justin's paella and the table's lobster mashed potatoes (ohmygod is this GOOD!) to the caramelized banana ice cream tower.  Yeah.  Tower.  Add to that a few bites of rhubarb berry pie and molten chocolate cake, a cocktail and some wine and I was blissed out and straight up fat.  I actually made Justin pat my belly.Stars of the evening:  lobster mashed potatoes, as noted above, and the cauliflower porcini risotto that accompanied my fish.  I hate mushrooms, but love cauliflower and EVERYONE knows that cauliflower trumps mushrooms, so there you have it.  What a delicious side dish.  Also, our server was a rock star.  She handled our 10-top with grace and humor even though she appeared to be younger than all of us.  She was also very kind in allowing me to sample two wines prior to selecting my favorite (which, of course, contributed to my tipsiness and over-indulgence).The restaurant itself is lovely with its three levels--a bit more serene and ""grown up"" in the downstairs jazz section, a bit more casual on the first level bar area and a bit more cozy and chic on the upper level.  I like that they offered variety without seeming schizophrenic--each section flowed nicely into the other.I should probably point out that I was a spoiled girl on a family vacation for this meal, so I didn't have to shell out, myself...  If I had, maybe I'd give only 4 stars... *Maybe*  But everything was so good, from drinks to food to service to music and ambiance...  I don't have a single complaint.  Finally.",4,2,3,Julia W.,"Saint Louis, MO",264,429,112

We ordered another appetizer but for the life of me I cant remember what it was. He got a soft shell barbeque crab special as an entree and I ordered the ginger soy lacquered Chilean sea bass that was insanely delicious.  He liked the soft shell crabs, but not as much as I liked the sea bass.  Going downstairs was such a treat.  It was a hot summer night and we randomly went to this really good seafood place that had a great live jazz band.  It was a great experience- if you're going to to definitely take advantage of downstairs!!!!",2,0,1,S.

So gooood BUT my only negative on this dish was what it was accompanied with.....the wasabi vinaigrette was NOT necessary...the kick the wasabi gave it hindered the great flavor of the fish....the sticky rice was fine but why the hell did they serve it with pickled ginger???....please save that for my sushi rolls This is Chilean sea bass not a spicy tuna roll.....ixnay on the gingeray please.I also had 4 oysters....my personal preference was the Mystic, CT.  I liked that one the best and it was the smallest.....I honestly can not remember the others I had....but all were pretty good.My friend had ordered a side of the lobster mashed potatoes...YUMMMMM....these were amazing BUT it would have been outrageous if there were big chunks of lobster in the potatoes....again, an awesome dish but with the lobster chunks it would have been out of this world.Anyway all in all a great meal and great experience....I want to go back!",3,0,2,J.

3.0,8/2/2008,"I was busted.EVERYWHERE I've gone, me, the non-drinker, has had absolutely no problem ordering a refined cocktail to accompany a huge meal that will leave me, someone who has never gotten drunk, perfectly fine and level-headed.However, yesterday, in an attempt to order a delicious sounding drink to go with my RW meal, I was asked to show ID (and well, admittedly, I am only 20.) The jig was up, and I laughingly admitted to being ten months away from being America's absolutely absurd drinking age. No matter; I commend the otherwise sweet waitress for doing what needed to be done.The reason Blue Water Grill receives a three is for other reasons. The place is beautiful and spacious, but the service was awkward (bread plates were not set, silverware handed over at weird intervals, my friend's cocktail was spilled onto the tablecloth) and the food not particularly awe-inspiring or consistent. Bread was placed on the table with a bit of butter that, in comparison to the prettiness of other restaurant week butter presentations, seemed like an afterthought. The bread too was very dull; we weren't fans of it.My friend decided to get the special cocktail for Restaurant Week, made with peaches and way too much alcohol for my underage palate. In all seriousness, it was way too boozy, and very little peach shone through. For appetizers, my friend had a fennel and asparagus salad with market greens, blue cheese and big fat cherries. Now, this salad was really good, and I liked it a lot.I decided to go for the stone fruit gazpacho with champagne creme fraiche and what looked like some shredded mint. I didn't taste a single bubble of champagne in the creme fraiche, and while the soup was super cold and pretty refreshing, its taste of basil was a bit too much for me. The dish ended up being of the heavy variety too, and I simply couldn't finish it (me!)For our main courses, my friend was disappointed in their shrimp and baby octopus dish, which was yet again a salad. The pototaoes and greens added a nice touch to the very delicious shellfish, but the olives and the lemon caper dressing were waaaaayyyyyy way too strong; they overwhelmed the entire dish.I decided to go a route I never went before and get a crispy fried soft shell crab sandwich; never in my life did I think I'd eat something of this nature, but it was good. The huge pieces of bread were slathered in a piquillo pepper relish (nice 'n spicy) and a healthy dose of mayo for wetness. Tomato (blegh) and crisp pieces of lettuce were thrown in, and the crab itself was delicious and crunchy. This too I couldn't finish.For dessert, my friend got a bittersweet chocolate torte, which was essentially a chocolate cake rectangle covered in a deep chocolate icing that practically melted into it. It was great, and the ""Black Forest Cake"" ice cream that went with it should be sold by the quart so I can eat it alone in my room.I was less impressed by my double-crust peach pie, as the menu called it. It was not warm, something I think the slightly gummy crust needed to make it flaky again, while the peach filling was nondescript. The bourbon pecan ice cream that topped it, however, was a show stopper.

Friend had to insistently tell the waiter she was *not* done with her appetizer to avoid having it yanked away.Food was mediocre at best, and gets a 'poor' based on being significantly overpriced to boot.  Paella was dry and not very flavorful.

4.0,6/25/2008,"Blue Water Grill is a great spot for lunch with friends.  The first time I went to this Union Square establishment, it was for a business lunch.  My companions suggested this place and they couldn't have picked a nicer spot.  For some reason it always feels very cool in here - maybe it's the marble everywhere, maybe they have the air cranked up all the time, who knows - but it's a pleasant, relaxing atmosphere where you can get a wonderful meal.Seafood is obviously the specialty, and since my first meal here I've returned several times with friends.  We've always enjoyed it.  I've gotten the tuna salad on numerous occasions and it's always been fresh and delicious.  The service has always been punctual and professional - never snooty or over-the-top, and I never felt as though this place was too ""ritzy"" for the average person.  It's a nice place where you can have a great meal.",1,0,1,L K.,"Westchester County, NY",13,233,21

We showed up on time and were told that they were ""running a little behind schedule"" and that we'd be seated soon.  So they told us to have a seat at the bar and we could have a drink while we wait. We ordered a bottle of wine thinking it would be a wait of 10-15 minutes.  It was an hour later when we were finally seated. What's the point of making a reservation? Our waiter was friendly and attentive enough, but even after waiting an hour to be seated, he got my order wrong. So after our entrees came out, I still had to wait another 10 minutes for my correct side dish to come out.  My appetizer was amazing. It was, I think, thai calamari.  My dinner was rather unremarkable.  The dining room is so noisy, even though the decor is sexy.

The bar is not that big but the staff moves people in and out who are waiting and before we knew it, we were off to our table.I had been here before and had lunch at the same bar. If you have read any of my other reviews, I like a good bar to chin up to and have a drink and some food. The bar is nice but not one for long nights of drinking and conversation. The restaurant is the spot light and there are three levels to enjoy: downstairs, ground level and a loft type space. There was four of us so we could order and try a bunch of stuff and we did. The wedge salad and Caesar salad were a good size, good flavors and other than a little too much dressing (this is a personal opinion) great as a lite meal. We had some sushi and maki rolls made of fresh fish and served beautifully. I had the lobster sliders with potato chips; a good choice for a lobster ""fix"". And the calamari was crispy outside, tender inside and made into a warm type salad with greens; we shared this and all thought it was good.An average value for your dollar, a great spot for lunch or dinner, the Blue Water Grill is a relaxed place, great for making new friends or a first date or even for those get together's on special occasions.

The spicy salmon maki roll appetizer was a party. in. your. mouth. And the entrees were cooked great. My char (salmon) was cooked at a perfect medium rare -- melt-in-your-mouth tender and seasoned just right. And the almond-crusted black ruff tasted great -- although the accompanying ""risotto"" wasn't anything what we expected (tasted very whole grainy and chewy). I wasn't sold on it. But then... the disaster of the night came in the form of dessert. Now I'm rarely one to leave anything sugary on the table. ... But I was unimpressed by the 2 desserts that defiled our otherwise perfectly yummy dinner table. The ""Creamsicle parfait"" was completely disgusting. It came in the form of a pannacotta of sorts, with bits of lemony (?) citrus on top of a weird soggy shortbread thing. I couldn't even get past the first bite. The Chocolate Fudge torte fared a bit better, but the torte was too dense, and we just were far from thrilled. The only thing that got finished for the desserts was the pistachio ice cream.

Since we made our reservation 3 weeks ago seating wasn't an issue at all, despite the fact that we were there half an hour earlier so we hung out at the bar until the table was ready.The Restaurant Week menu was quite straightforward and we immediately knew what we were going to get. We decided to get different dishes from the 3-course menu -- and the appetizers didn't disappoint. The Long Island Oysters were very fresh and so as the salmon inside the Spicy Salmon Rolls They were both light and healthy and those dishes suit us (the runners) well. For main courses we decided to get the Striped Bass and the Redfish Stew. The Striped Bass is definitely the dish to go for because the fish was so fresh and the mean textures were unbelievable. On the other hand, my stew was a little bit disappointing. I wasn't able to identify the differences between the stew at BWG and the stew at some other regular Thai restaurant. If you don't want to get the bass, try the Pistachio Crusted Black Ruff.We had the Creamsicle parfait and the Chocolate Fudge Torte for desserts, and our server also gave us extra ice cream and chocolates because he gave us little attention during the time we were there. Since we don't eat too many desserts anyway we ended up eating just a bit, but the presentation was clear-cut and you can't beat the chocolate in a cold winter night.The experience was great once again at Blue Water Grill, but the servers need to pay attention to their customers especially when the restaurant isn't full.

4.0,1/2/2008,"What should a 100th review be comprised of? What qualities must an establishment possess in order for it to be milestone worthy? These are the questions that plagued me and put me on a 2+ week hiatus from reviewing on Yelp. I felt lost, frustrated and worthless.Then I realized, no matter what the place; good, bad, expensive, cheap, near, far....it just should be memorable. I wanted my 100th review to have a story behind it! You say I'm over-thinking this? Perhaps.It came to me today, while sitting on the train. DUH. I'd been meaning to review BWG since I joined Yelp, but something kept stopping me! It has to be my 100th review.My first trip to Blue Water Grill was a surprise date with my boyfriend many moons ago. It was a freezing cold night in January and he had made last minute reservations for the downstairs Jazz Room. We were seated immediately in front of the piano by the very friendly hostess and I took in the warm yet exciting ambience. I hadn't eaten in many NYC restaurants yet at this point, and I had high expectations.Thankfully, I wasn't let down. Our waiter was exceptional that evening! He was attentive and had such rhythm. I was highly impressed by his service (and that takes a LOT). The food that night was also top notch. First, we gorged ourselves on oysters that tasted so fresh they left us forgetting for the moment that we both had lobsters coming. I could barely eat my veggie side dishes by the time I was done with the lobster, though what I did taste was very good. By the end of our entrees we were totally spent........but we still dared to order dessert, of course! I don't know how I managed to cram another morsel into my mouth, but the bittersweet chocolate garnished with raspberries that arrived on my plate tempted the fate of my digestive system into overload. To top off a perfect evening and meal, the oh-so-kind waiter brought us complimentary champagne with dessert. :)Since that fabulous experience, we've returned twice. Once for our anniversary, and another for Valentine's Day (NOTE: the Valentine's Day Dessert Tray was the most OUT OF THIS WORLD sweetness I've ever eaten! Passion fruit everything=so good!!!!) When we do eat there now, we are a bit smarter with ordering and we always eat in the main dining room and request a ""quiet table.""We consider it a special occasion sort of place, as it is a smidgen over-priced and over-hyped (read: even with a reservation, you'll wait) ...and there ARE tons of other restaurants in the city where you get more bang for your buck. Still, it has a special place in my heart and gets 4.5 stars.",12,8,15,Melanie Rose P.,"Boulder, CO",751,192,22

But I digress.Anyways, the food and service were both excellent. I had the grilled chicken salad. Everything was great except the white asparagus was very gummy. I picked them all out. My cousin had the braised sea bass with soba noodle salad. The glaze on her fish was a bit sweet for my taste, but oh sweet lord the noodle salad was SO GOOD. Mango, cilantro, soba noodles, and a sprinkle of crack - delicious.Reasonably priced, right in Union Square, and the food was good.

Our waiter was very polite, not overbearing, made great suggestions (he says the lobster sandwich or lobster salad are his favorites), and prompt delivery of food and check. We had the lobster bisque, the Maryland crab cake, and a lobster sandwich. I'm not one to send the food back, a hair is a hair, but the food was a little too pricey to let them slip up on such a big hair. I was in a tight schedule and had to jet, but they were more than willing to compensate for the little mishap- they comped it off my bill, also took a soup appetizer off, and offered me dessert. I didn't accept the dessert but was very appreciative of their efforts to make it all better.

My fave is the Chilean Sea Bass, served with chinese broccoli and sticky rice with a light wasabi sauce. After having a bite you'll agree it's ""mouth-watering good"", sooo soft and tasty.We recently had my younger sis' bday dinner here, on the balcony ofcourse, and it was great. All the dishes were superb; some of us stuck with our faves. We were pleased with everything, from seating to service. They allowed us to bring in a cake (no plate fee and held it in the fridge).

3.0,10/25/2007,"I've been meaning to write this review for a while, but hadn't had the chance to.  It's funny how some things about a place stay with you and others leave.  My lunch at Blue Water Grill was one of my last experiences in New York City.I came here with a coworker who missed my farewell party since he spending his vacation with his family in Korea.  He was unshaven -- he needed a shave -- and talked about golf, about work, about family as we sat on the outside balcony, watching the people come and go.  Fall was beginning to settle in, and the weather was slightly humid, but bearably warm.Having worked in Union Square for over two years, it was hard to miss Blue Water Grill with its granite pillars and the trail of tables on 16th Street.  This was one of the places nearby work that I had been looking forward to trying out, but never had the chance.  Union Square Cafe. Medina Cafe.  Olives.  Sushi Samba.  A list of missed opportunity.We split a lobster shrimp spring roll to start with -- this is a dish that I would definitely recommend -- the wrap was crunchy and the savory chunks of meat were delicious.Our waitress overfilled my ice water but with our sideways glances tuned to the street, the taxi cabs, and the pedestrians and their shopping bags from Diesel and Sephora, we let it slide.  The service was a little icy in general -- when you're paying twenty to thirty bucks a dish, you expect more.My entree was a Chilean sea bass with a side slaw with mangoes and Asian pears.  The Chilean sea bass, as expected, was rich and buttery, with just a touch of sear along the edges.  The slaw, on the other hand, needed a little help -- the fruit was not yet ripe -- and rather than the having its sweetness balance the dish, the tartness took something away.Saying goodbye.  Spending my last two weeks in New York seeing friends, eating at new places.The waitress overfilled my glass of ice water again.I thought about leaving New York, a city I loved but knew so little about.  Starting a new life in San Francisco, my hometown, but with a future as uncertain as the fog pulled through Golden Gate at dusk.  A new home, my girlfriend, and unemployment was waiting for me.  My family in New York would do what they normally do without me, getting the kids ready for school, ordering Indian take out, watching TV.  My thoughts were dense with excitement and regret.  This was my experience at Blue Water Grill.",1,1,3,Tony L.,"San Francisco, CA",731,1265,21

Apparently, our server sized us up right away and decided that we weren't worth her time. My water sat empty for almost 10 minutes while all of the surrounding tables were well watered. I was in the mood for a lovely evening out, and was made to feel like I didn't belong there. And it's not like it's THAT cool of a place anyway!

5.0,8/2/2007,"I love love love Blue Water Grill. This restaurant specializes in seafood, and the fish does not disappoint. I came here for dinner for Summer Restaurant Week with friends (including an out-of-towner), and I can confidently say that my out-of-town friend got the NYC dining experience everyone needs to get when visiting NYC.1) DELICIOUS food. The bread was warm and freshly baked and came with whipped SALTED butter (Yum!). I got a raw oyster appetizer plate (great tartar sauce) and the halibut (soft, no bones, flavorful). The arrangement and presentation of the food was so nice that we whipped out a couple of cameras to take pictures of the food. The peach cobbler dessert was good but average.2) Great ambiance. There's something effortless and modest about the overall atmosphere. The upscale decoration is very tasteful (not overly trendy with tacky mod lights or anything like that). Something that's so simple but very well done is that every table was equipped with a tall candlestick. The glow of the candlelight was bright enough for me to see my food and everyone's faces around the table (which is not always the case with candlelight dinners), and it brought a level of privacy to our conversation in a relatively busy restaurant. At one point during my dinner, I quickly scanned the dim room and saw that everyone was engrossed in their own intimate conversations, candlelight softly flickering in their faces. The restaurant was full yet not crowded, so it's great for romantic dates and group dinners. Noise level was a little loud (as we were seated next to the jazz band), but we could still have conversation without raising our voices.3) Service is excellent. Our server was very nice, constantly refilled our water glasses, and recommended a great white wine (Riesling) to us.4) Super clean restroom with lotions and a towel attendant. I'm a believer that the quality of a restaurant's appearance and restroom reflects the quality of the food.5) Good location.

4.0,6/26/2007,"Even on a Monday night, the place was sizzling with no sign of ever slowing down.  We could barely squeeze ourselves among the tourists and the locals into the bar to get a few drinks.As we waited impatiently and asked the hostess again to check on our table, he informed us that someone had just canceled their reservation for a small table in the jazz room downstairs.  Reservations definitely recommended for this place. The moment we walked down, I started imagining how cool it'd be to be on a romantic date with a hot guy to a place like this.  Great atmosphere.  Orange candle light.  Mellow live jazz.  Cozy and velvety booths.  My dear friend was not at all offended when I declared so - he felt the same, although he murmured, ""Bitch"" underneath his breath.  Nonetheless, we were in good company with a trio jazz band that came with a handsome cello player.  McDreamy was his nickname for the night.  And my friend also seemed content with the cute young hostess from downstairs who came by our table to check up (on him) periodically.The upside of going to a place like this with a good friend is that you can just indulge yourself with awesome food, with no one to get to know or impress.  Talking was optional.We started off with a seafood sampler - it came with a lobster tail, jumbo rock shrimp, North Point oysters (from Prince Edwards) and stemmed elephant clams.  Perfectly chilled.  All excellent.  Especially when paired with a Roussane from France. We proceeded to sushi rolls and sashimi.  And then I was perplexed.Sushi Cardinal Rule #1: Don't mix the raw and the cooked and roll them up as if they go together.  They don't.  No matter what exotic sauce goes with it.How can a seafood place that has sushi and sashimi on 1/3 of its menu not have known this rule?  And then again, it was my friend who ordered the special rolls so I had no one to blame but him.  What the heck was he thinking?  He happily swallowed all those rolls, as I was having none of them.I got myself some authentic sushi - just plain raw good pieces of fish, hovering over small balls of rice seasoned with rice vinegar and sugar.  Perfect.  You can judge a sushi place by its sushi rice - and this place certainly did not miss the mark.  A traditional sushi-ist would approve.To be fair, this place is not exactly known for its sushi and sashimi.  There are far more bounty fares on the menu, all sounding very tempting.  I was just in the mood for plain good sushi.A couple rounds of jazz sets and drinks later, we ran into some friends who were hanging out by the bar.  We joined in.  After all, this was New York City.  The night had just begun...",1,0,1,Shirley F.,"San Francisco, CA",31,171,719
4.0,6/24/2007,"This joint is ginormous, with a two story, high-ceilinged top floor, and a pretty large ""jazz room"" in the basement. I managed to reserve a table for 4 for Friday night that afternoon itself, so that was nice. We sat in the jazz room which had a threesome playing some pretty mellow background music - I liked the vibe. The acoustics of the place sort of amplified the voices though, so it was quite noisy in there. Lots of birthday dinners and big crowds. I took my parents here because we were looking to go someplace nice, but casual. This was it! The lobster bisque was good, but not as great as I expected. A little on the salty side. My dad hit a food jackpot night because all his dishes tasted the best. The salad was good and Nori big-eyed tuna crusted with some crunchy pepper crust thing (done medium) was the best dish of the night.. although I'd have gotten it medium rare to rare. B enjoyed his softshell crab dish and thought that the creamy salad that accompanied it, complemented the saltiness of the crab very well. Mom's red snapper was too salty and quite unimpressive - the one dud.I order the salmon special entree of the night, which featured salmon that can only be caught 6 weeks in a year (or something fancy like that). Being a sucker for timely goods, I picked it over the scallop dish - and it was an awesome choice. The sashimi grade salmon steak was lightly grilled on the outside, completely melt-in-your-mouth raw on the inside, served with a sweet mango chutney sauce and cous cous. Pretty good stuff. DESSERT!! The ice cream on the menu is listed as $6 - for 3 scoops. But since I only wanted a scoop of the earl grey one to try.. it was only $1.50!! Hella cheap.. and yummy. I love tea, so tea in an ice cream form was quite delectable. The caramel banana tower thing was a bit of a sugar-overload, even for a sugarjunkie like myself. The chocolate fondue was a good deal and a hit with the whole table. After she ran out of fruit to dip, my mom was dipping her plain stick in the chocolate and licking it off.. yes, it was good quality stuff. I'd definitely come back again if:- it's the right occasion to splurge / parents are visiting- I'm in the mood for seafood - esp. tuna- I'm eating with people who don't like/eat red meat and the likes- I want fondue and/or earl grey ice cream",6,0,3,Pam S.,"Brooklyn, NY",186,412,399
4.0,6/19/2007,"Blue Water Grill reminds me of a Swiss army knife - it's practical, not trendy and serves multiple purposes.Breakfast, lunch, dinner and late night.Family, friends, business or date.Inside or outside.Live jazz or sounds of the street.Main bar or hidden bar.Hamburger or caviar.I like to get a quick drink at the bar downstairs on a weekend night when the rest of the area is packed. The bar only has a few seats so it's not a destination spot for the masses. If you go early they usually have a live jazz trio.The old bank interior is spacious and grand. If you want something more intimate but you're not in the mood for candlelight and jazz downstairs, ask for a table upstairs in the loft section. The ceiling is lower and the feel more exclusive. The many pronged brass chandeliers with red covered lamps add a touch of luxury and complexity to the air.The main thing Blue Water Grill has going in my book is consistency.  The food is always above average and the service solid. Kudos to B.R.Guest Restaurants for maintaining a high level of quality and service as they expand their restaurant empire: Fiamma, Dos Caminos,  Isabella's,  Atlantic Grill,  Ocean Grill, etc. The menu changes seasonally to keep things fresh. It's designed so there's something for everyone: fish, steak, sushi, hamburgers, salads, oysters, and soups. The sushi won't blow your socks off.

We had a nice bottle of red and polished off the meal with some ice-wines.  All up, the meal cost $290 (inclusive of tip), so it's not cheap.  I think there are other seafood restaurants in the city where you'd get a better meal.Also, is somewhat like a cruise-ship: very big, tonnes of people, under-staffed and bland.",0,0,0,Deena D.,"New York, NY",2,22,0

Grilled shrimp and scallops were cooked and seasoned perfectly. Our entire table agreed the food was exceptionally good. We were not rushed between courses and could enjoy the wine, food, and conversation.They weren't ready for our group so we had to wait beyond our reservation time. Also, they did not have tables for us in the balcony as requested. To their credit, we were in a big group on a busy night.We also had a problem with the ""upsell."" Our server tried to get us to order a more expensive wine and also tried to push appetizers and desserts beyond simply offering them to us.

5.0,4/27/2007,"My favorite restaurant in NYC.The chilean sea bass melts in your mouth like butter. For an appetizer I have only ever had the steamed shrimp dumplings, mostly because after the first time I had them I've never wanted to try anything else. Above all, the atmosphere is wonderful. From the jazz room downstairs to the mezzanine (which is best if you're seated close to the railing) you can't go wrong.

Love it!   I did order a warm chocolate molten cake this time, but was disappointed.  The cake didn't have any chocolate ""gushing"" out like I would expect it to have.  Over-done and dry.  Just stick to the Sea Bass when you come here.",1,0,0,Jannie Q.,"San Francisco, CA",33,280,63
4.0,3/26/2007,"Good evening.americanrhetoric.com/spe…This is the 37th time I have spoken to you from this website, from where many decisions have been made that helped the history of my palate. Each time, I have come to discuss with you some matter that I believe affected the Yelpland interest.In all the decisions I have made in my public reviews, I have always tried to do what was best for Yelpland. Throughout the long and difficult waiting on WaterGrill, I felt it was my duty to persevere, to make every possible effort to complete the dinner courses that I had elected.In the past few seconds, however, it had become evident to me that the Snapper didn't had a strong enough time at the Grill to justify continuing that effort. As long as there was such a base, I felt strongly that it was necessary to see the digestion process through to its conclusion, that to do otherwise would be unfaithful to the spirit of that deliberately difficult process and a dangerously destabilizing precedent for the stomach.But with the tasting of the Snapper, I now believed that the nurturing purpose had been served, and there was no longer a need for digestion to be prolonged.I would have preferred to carry through to the finish whatever the personal agony it would have involved, and my tummy's growls unanimously urged me to do so. But the interests of Yelpland must always come before any ravenous considerations.From the platters I have had in restaurants and other grills, I have concluded that because of the WaterGrill matter I might not give the rating that I would consider necessary to back the very difficult decision to carry on the foodie duties of this website in the way the interests of Yelpland would require.I have never been a quitter. To leave the Snapper unfinished before the dinner is completed is abhorrent to every instinct in my body. But as Yelper, I must put the interest of Yelpland first. Yelpland needs a full-time Yelper and a full-time Reviewer, particularly at this time of great reviews home and abroad.To continue to talk about the terrible Snapper for my personal vindication would almost totally absorb the time and attention of both Javier M. and the rest of the Yelpers in a period when our entire focus should be on the great issues of ambience and sea food diversity without inflation at cost.Therefore, I shall assign this restaurant a 4 star rating effective at noon tomorrow. Elite Yelper Ryan will swear me a Thanks! comment at that hour in this website.",1,2,4,Javier M.,"New York, NY",723,387,174
4.0,3/23/2007,"Definitely dug the jazz room for dinner last night. I went to join my friends, who had gotten a table for 3. This was easily turned into 4. Then, we found out a fifth was coming. We had already ordered an appetizer (calamari) and drinks, but we were easily moved to a booth (much comfier than the smushed together tables!). Since our waiter became a waitress, there was some confusion over the appetizer. Finally, it came. Meh. It tasted burnt to me, and I was starving! But kudos for tentacles.Our entrees took freakin forever to come, we weren't really in a rush and didn't mind too much, but we were also hungry. I got the grilled swordfish with a sweet potato and crab sauce. The crab was yummy in the sauce, which was very sweet, but the sweet potatoes were cubed (unappealing, visually, even in the dim light) and kind of rubbery. Other dishes at our table included the filet mignon, which was deemed decent, and the sea bass, which was quite good apaprently, and THE CASTLE - this looked awesome, huge assortment of different oysters, clams, shrimp, lobster, etc...this is definitely what I would get if I came again, but to split only, it's enormous!!!).Wine list was pretty good, but mighty expensive by the glass (saw a sauvignon blanc that I know goes for $20 a bottle at $19 a glass, come on now, I know you make money on the booze, but that's just annoying). Make a reservation, also, because it gets busy!Overall, it was good. Pricey for what it was...but the seafood was fresh, no doubt, and overall, pretty yummy. I really dug the jazz room, don't think upstairs would be as much fun, unless you sat outside and people watched, but if you get THE CASTLE, I think people on the street will watch you instead anyway!",3,0,3,Irene F.,"Pleasantville, NY",687,1833,7
4.0,3/9/2007,"On Sundays, Blue Water Grill has a special brunch menu.  I usually try to make a reservation in the jazz room, which is downstairs and a little cozier than the main dining room.  It's a little darker though and the live jazz can get a little loud sometimes, but it's fun.  The food is good, the portions are decent and the prices on the brunch menu are much lower than you'd expect.  My favorite is the crabcakes benedict, which comes with unlimited juice and coffee.",1,0,1,Michelle Y.,"San Francisco, CA",11,46,0

1.0,1/26/2007,"So I went here for Restaurant Week (which may explain some of what I'm about to write) and couldn't believe how bad the service was. After waiting for like 15 minutes for our waitress to acknowledge us, my girlfriend said something like,""When is our waitress going to show up?""Our waitress was walking by when she said that and did that Kobe Bryant after he hits a big basket thing. Y'know the both palms down while you pump your arms up and down like you're a mime pretending to be getting out of the pool thing. I guess she (like Kobe) was trying to nonverbally tell us, ""calm down baby, I'm on the mothafucka.""but c'mon! She didn't say anything like ""I'll be with you in a moment. Sorry about the wait"" and didn't return for another 5 minutes. Our water glasses were only refilled once. There were two inexpensive ($35 I think) wines on the Restaurant Week menu. After ordering one of them, we found out they were currently out of stock and when my friend asked if she could just go ahead and get the other, she said.""I dont have that menu on me and Im not sure which one it is. Just order off of the wine menu.""  Which was hella expensive. My friend even said that he looked at the  menu and the bottles were more than he wanted to spend. She stil wouldn't get the damn Restaurant week menu and my friend ordered a $45 bottle instead of the $35 he wanted. And the Raw Trio made me and my friend sick.

3.0,1/5/2007,"Housed in an old building with lots of marble, high ceilings, huge windows and nice mouldings, the interior is classic Manhattan.  The brunch menu is pretty classic too:  any variation of Eggs Benedict was the favorite at our table.  Eggs Benedict with lobster or Steak & Eggs Benedict, can't go wrong with it.  The hollandaise was pretty tangy because it's normally a flavorless humdrum sauce at most establishments these days.  Continuing on the aqua theme, BWG offers a pretty large selection of sushi rolls.  Coconut shrimp served with a coconut based dipping sauce was nice as was the spicy tuna, which had just the right amount of spice coating.  As for dessert, the eggnog creme brulee was a bit too out of the ordinary for me, but worth a try if you might be a creme-brulee freak.  The ice cream selection had a unique flavor: pomegranate caramel which had only a mildly berry-like flavor but much more caramelly.  The banana tower was this unique edifice composed of a hazelnut brittle cylinder stuffed with with banana ice cream.  Nice!  I opted for green tea as I want to cut back on my calories (that and I knew I'd have plenty of tastes of the dishes around me).  They served it already steeped and it had been steeping too long for a green tea.The setting was New Year's Eve Afternoon and the staff was busy coating the ceiling with thousands of black and white balloons.

The calamari was perfectly cooked, and was melt-in-your-mouth delicious. Sure it's a bit on the pricey side (2 appetizers, 2 entrees, 2 coffees and 1 dessert = $100+ tip), but it's worth it if you want to impress, or celebrate a birthday!

There is not a dish I or my fellow eaters have had at Blue Water Grill that is bad or even average, which not many an eatery can boast.   However, the service is another story.  (Note the lack of 5 stars) Each of the four occasions that I have gone, all at different times of the day and evening I might add, I can say that the service has ranged from abnormally slow to ""did someone shoot my waiter?""  Though the servers are mostly friendly and helpful, it is quite obvious that there are simply not enough of them to serve this always  busy Union Square staple.  I appreciate not being rushed out the door, but when you have to wait for half an hour for your check or to get another drink the wait becomes intrusive on the the pleasure of the meal.  Usually noisy and very much part of the people watching milieu of Union Square I know I will come here again but I will try and make sure I have 3 hours to spend on my meal.",0,0,1,sara w.,"Brooklyn, NY",28,51,0
