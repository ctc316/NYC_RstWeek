4.0,4/28/2019,This was our first time in New York and wanted to splurge a little bit and have nice dinner with family. I would definitely recommend trying it. It was very tasty!!! We had our 14 year old son with us and he got the fettuccine Alfredo and he devoured every bite. We were so full that we didn't try dessert but wish we would have.,0,0,0,Joyce B.,"Brighton, CO",0,7,3
5.0,4/8/2019,"The way it used to be; if you want to be transported back in time, when restaurant owners actually worked in the restaurant and recognized their regulars by name, Rossini's is a Must visit, especially for ""new"" New Yorkers.  You get to enjoy great food and family style service that made NY the food capital of the world!",0,0,0,Michael D.,"Toms River, NJ",0,1,0
4.0,4/6/2019,"Hidden in one of the quiet streets but inside the restaurant, it's usually pretty busy. It has that classic vibe to it and old italian decor with nice chairs and tables. It's a pretty fancy restaurant actually but also has cozy feeling.All their food is above average with excellent service. All their appetizers are good. I think most people will like their tomato sauce pasta but to me it's a bit sour but it's not that strong so it doesn't bother me. I'm not a huge fan of their tomato sauce so I get the ravioli with vodka sauce which is fantastic. Desserts are pretty good too. They have round and large tables so it's good for groups.",0,0,1,Jae C.,"Westwood, NJ",4,132,353

They put us at the table near to bar and forgot about our existence for good 20 minutes .I had to go ask bartender several times for the menu and drinks till we got  some attention from the waiters.

3.0,3/9/2019,I was a bit disappointed that they sat us in corner where our view was of the server's kiosk. We had a reservation and there were many open tables. The description of the Caesar Salad was definitely more elaborate then the salad we received. I had the shrimp in a champagne sauce and it was good. My spouse had the chicken Parmesan with a white sauce. It was also good. Nothing we had was particularly flavorful and it was expensive.,0,0,0,Laurie M.,"Belleville, MI",13,73,0

2.0,3/3/2019,"I've lived in this neighborhood for 7 years and myself and/or family have been here 200 times. My most recent visit was the worst dining experience ever. It was myself, boyfriend and best girlfriend. 9pm on a Wednesday and it was busy, but no wait, made a reservation 15 minutes prior. The service was RUSHED. 2/3 meals were OKAY. I've ordered chicken parm 75/200 times I've been here and this was the worst meal I've ever had. It tasted like they dumped a can of tomato paste on a piece of chicken, I had to scrape so much off. The avocado shrimp scallop salad had 3 tiny shrimp, 1 cut scallop, half of an avocado for $23. Again, the service was RUSHED. As we are leaving, I went the restroom, they approach my boyfriend and said he did not leave enough tip, after we clearly left 18% on 2 cards even though the service and 1 meal were AWFUL! The nerve!

2.0,12/1/2018,"Not a good experience! Had a reservation for 8:30pm. Was taken to an unset table. The waiter passed us the napkins and silverware to set ourselves. Strike one. We were brought water, but waited for about 10 minutes for menus. Ordered a Caesar salad. The worst I have ever had. Iceberg lettuce which is understandable because of the recall but wilted lettuce is not acceptable. The croutons were out of a box and then they covered the plate with a blanket of Parmesan. Strike two. The waiter was in such a rush to get us to buy another bottle of wine that before our glasses were even near empty he was filling them up and pushing us to buy. We didn't. Strike three. Our entrees were just meh. The sides were slapped on the plate and tasteless. Honestly I couldn't tell what they were. Maybe a sweet potato pudding mix, and a triangular quiche like effervescent of spinach slice. With tasteless green beans. The restaurant was packed and loud! We didn't stay for dessert, but the descriptions sounded okay.",1,0,0,Judy T.,"San Francisco, CA",230,16,0

4.0,11/19/2018,"Rossini's is a great Italian place, whether you're a fanatic of Italian food or just a casual eater. There are only small things I would advise people who come here to this New York style Italian restaurant.We walked in and immediately felt a sense of ease. Not only is atmosphere wonderful, but the staff allow you to take off your jacket, scarves, and any clothing item that just keeps you warm and hang it up until the end of the night. This allows you to enjoy your experience and feel comfortable. It may not 100% feel like Italy, but it is still really nice. What about the staff, the people that, you know, give you the nice feel?Well, they're great. They are very simple people that make you feel luxurious (which is why this place is a bit pricy), by putting your napkin on your lap and such. They are very attentive and will morph the dish you desire into your dreams. They may screw up a bit (my brother ordered Gnocchi, but got Fettuccine Alfredo instead, and they also didn't take it off the check right away), but it still will make you feel nice. And what's with the food?It's what you'd expect from an American-Italian restaurant. Delicious, but from a person who's had Italian food, it's not the best. Very opinionated, but it IS still great. I got the Cesar Salad, which tasted like what you'd expect, so I won't go into detail. I also got Seafood Risotto, which tasted amazing. The lovely sauce topped with the beautiful seafood made an unforgettable experience, with minor nitpicks.

4.0,11/6/2018,Was visiting NY for business and was looking for good restaurant in the mid town area east side. I remembered seeing Rossini's over the years passing the restaurant many times but never going in. Well last night I had the pleasure of having dinner there and it only took me 40 years to have the experience. We were greeted by the host and led to a nice table in the dining room. All the waiters were wearing dinner jackets as were the wait staff. The place was jumping with people who looked like regulars enjoying themselves and familiar with the menu which was very extensive. My associate and I had calamari as an appetizer and both had a scrumptious order of chicken Parmesan which was great and served with potato-veggie and polenta all was super. This restaurant was everything I hoped for. One other note we were sitting next to the actor Paul Sorvino with friends who gave me the impression he was a regular. Very friendly crowd all having a good time and enjoying the surroundings and the food. I look forward to another visit.Irwin Z,0,0,0,Irwin Z.,"Chatsworth, Los Angeles, CA",0,133,6

And you don't have one waiter..I think we had About five different people at our table. They were all very kind and attentive. Jose was especially great. The red sauce served with our calamari...I have never tasted such beautiful sauce. There must be some genius in the kitchen making gallons of it. I wish I had the recipe. I had spicy prawns and they were cooked perfectly with a wonderful red peppery sauce. My wife had Alfredo. It was very good. We ended with cannoli...and why wouldn't we?

5.0,7/28/2018,"Old school...yes...but don't you think the old way provided a great foundation?   Rossini's is definitely old school; tuxedo waiters, piano player, comfy chairs, solicitous service, warmth and the ability to hear each other talk.  I loved it!  The flatbread has a surprise of caraway. The brochette was void of onion, just the way I prefer it.  The butter was salted and the olive oil was deliciously flavored with basil.  All of this came with a perfect martini. Wilson guided us through the menu.  I think I fell in love with him.  ""Caldi alla Rossini"" means covered in yummyness. The shrimp, clams and eggplant appetizer was in a heavenly sauce. Veal as tender as a Harry Connick Jr.  love song.

Restaurant was spacious and can easily accommodate large groups.  Menu was northern Italian and offered many choices.  In addition, there were daily specials which the waiter recited.  Prices are fair for the ambience, level of service, and of course, the food.  For apps, we ordered  fresh mozzarella and tomatoes, grilled octopus, baked clams, and linguine with white clams.  Although not on the menu, they made fried zucchini when we requested it.  All apps were very good except the octopus, which was a little overcooked.  Entrees were filet of bronzini in lemon sauce, vitello francese, saltimbocca, chicken scapariello, and bistecca Tuscan.  All were very good, especially the bronzini.  We had two bottles of wine, one scotch and with coffee and dessert, the bill came to a little under $600 with tip.  This is fair for the ambience, service and food, so I would come back.",0,0,0,Wayne T.,"Long Island, NY",0,44,0

They had a lot of specials, but I ordered the linguine with pesto sauce from the menu. The portion was pretty large and the pasta was delicious! Definitely fresh and full of flavor.

2.0,4/25/2018,"I went to Rossini's last night for dinner after placing a reservation through Opentable.For dinner, I had the spaghetti carbonara and dover sole. The lack of coloration of pasta dough and the thiness of spaghetti suggested that the pasta wasn't fresh which is a big no-no among italian restaurants. The dover sole came with a light butter sauce that was well paired and salted, but the fish was slightly undercooked and a result the depth of flavor one would expect wasn't there. For the $50 mkt price for the dover sole, this was the worst value of the night. I frequently make fish dishes at home for less than $10 of frozen fish that results in better flavor.The atmosphere of Rossini's is warm and traditional Italian, seemingly unchanged since the late 90's. The clientele looks of a neighborhood restaurant club for corporate empty nesters. Its location off park avenue gives you some clues about the crowd. They seem to like it because they call it home, not because it has earned the right through quality of food or service.Overall, I'd give this restaurant 2 out of 5. Mediocre for a $$ restaurant, let alone a $$$ restaurant. If you're looking for classy dining with great service and food to match, I'd recommend Scarpetta instead.",1,0,0,Christian V.,"TriBeCa, Manhattan, NY",158,57,2

There's no drink menu, but the waiter will tell you there's a full bar and the wines by the glass. Chianti, montepulciano, pinot noir, and more. Service is super friendly, attentive, and even a bit ""showy"" (taking the napkin and placing it on your lap, bringing a decadent tray of desserts). Complimentary bread basket, bruschetta, and pesto/olive oil mixture and butter that come with the carbs. I ordered the mahi mahi, super good flaky fish that was fresh and delicate. The fish sits atop a jus, prob chicken stock and some others. Delicious anyway. Comes with a side of one croquette, and some other veggies on a small plate. We also got the seafood risotto, the risotto was cooked perfectly. It had a slight chewy texture to it, included pieces of small shrimp and other veggies. They have a great marketing technique for their dessert, bringing the array of options on a tray... it's way too tempting. There's a neopolitan, tres leches, red velvet, cheesecake, and a couple others. Also sorbets and ice creams. We got the red velvet, it was good not amazing.

5.0,11/21/2017,"You have to go there. It is the quintessential New York Italian restaurant. The hospitality is amazing. We were two elected district attorneys, a judge, and a city councilor, from all around the country, which the maitre d' sussed out from us right away. It's a spacious restaurant, romantically lit (but not too dark), and amazingly quiet. And the classic mix of people. I'm pretty sure Tony Soprano was sitting with his family in the corner booth,  gesturing to his daughter and son-in-law while Carmela sucked up spaghetti one by one. My head was filled with the theme song from The Godfather. Between the service and the ambiance, it was just a marvelous experience. The Antipasti Caldi alla Rossini was heavenly. Otherwise I can't say much about the food because I'd had a big lunch and ordered the corn soup and a small caesar salad. I didn't care for the soup. I was expecting a chowder and instead received a blah chicken broth with corn kernels and bits of carrot. Not exactly Campbell's, but in the neighborhood. The caesar was fine. My friends very much enjoyed their pastas and meats. We enjoyed 10-year ports and some kind of dessert that I don't remember.Go there.

And let me just say, I wish I had kept it a mystery. $90, one entree, two cocktails and one app later.. first of all, I have an issue with a restaurant not giving me a menu for the cocktails and then assuring me they'll fix something amazing based on your preference. Pretty sure my lemon martini had zero vodka and all lemon pledge flavoring. Next. I ordered the chicken special which was nothing special to write home about. Zero flavor. I had to douse in the pepper just to taste something other than bland white sauce. Looking around, as a 20 something year old, the average age was 70. Maybe why flavor was so bland? When I asked for the bill and inquired about the resident discount- I live in the building attached- they claimed this was only on take out. When I got home- literally one door away- the flyer in the lobby said 15% off for residents- also confirmed by my doorman.

The food is delicious, the portions very generous and the prices are quite reasonable.We enjoyed a lovely family meal, though this is certainly a spot worthy of a romantic date, a special occasion dinner, or even a business luncheon or holiday party. Many thanks to the entire staff for tactfully overlooking the fact my two teenage boys had been playing soccer in Central Park all afternoon and arrived at dinner in shorts and sneakers. They had certainly worked up an appetite and heartily appreciated the stuffed tortellini in the sherry wine sauce, and the spaghetti carbonara.  The special salmon in white wine sauce was superb.  And the seared scallops were perfectly cooked.",0,0,0,Jen V.,"Midtown East, Manhattan, NY",0,67,7

5.0,8/1/2017,"Top notch service!!I enjoyed the hospitality here at Rossini's. My entire night from walking into the restaurant to when I finished was spectacular.Located in the Midtown section of the East Side amid luxury apartments, Rossini's offers old world Italian with a friendly neighborhood smile. After I was warmly welcomed and seated at my table, within 30 seconds a huge bread basket was brought out to me along with a generous amount of olive oil to dip it in. Also, they even included a free slice of bruschetta compliments of the chef.I started off with the Caprese salad. The mozzarella was really creamy and fresh, divided into 2 slices and alternated with two thick slices of tomato and basil. A side of roasted pepper and prosciutto also tied in the whole plate.For my entree I once again ordered my favorite, the Linguine Vongole. I've had countless versions of this dish at other places before, but here at Rossini's they take it to a whole 'nother level. At other restaurants, they usually just do a simple garlic and olive oil base sauce. Here at Rossini's they really take the time to make this rich, clam soup that permeates and soaks into the pasta. The broth had this rich, seafoody flavor that was believe it or not actually sweet.They also add a generous amount of clam meat and garlic.And for dessert, I ordered 2. I had both the Tiramisu and added a scoop of vanilla ice cream on the side. Perfect ending to the night. :)",8,4,6,Eric A.,"Brooklyn, NY",505,274,1594

4.0,4/25/2017,"I was so pleasantly surprised with this place!It was close to my hotel and open later than Hillstone nearby but Italian was also what I wanted. It was a dark entrance, suits and ties in the bar at the entrance and two dining rooms in back.  Split level.  And for NY, it was huge!  There was a big group on the lower side, so they sat us in a corner booth just the two of us, and were treated very well from start to finish.They give you bruschetta as an amuse bouche, which I though was kinda cold, but my husband liked it that way, said it was fresh and better that way.  I prefer mine room temperature, but I'm just picky.  There were 3 servers for a couple of parties up in our area so we never even had to flag anyone down, it was like they read our minds.  It was truly a 5 star experience for not a 5 star price.The warm spinach salad I ordered was made in front of us over open flame.  I thought it was slightly bitter, but my husband quickly traded his caesar from mine and it was awesome!  Simple, but really flavorful dressing.  I got the rigatoni filet di pomodoro and it was so different!  The taste was nothing I had ever experienced. I couldn't pin point why.  It was their version of Amatriciana.  My husband got the carbonara and I don't normally like that dish but this was by no means a over rich creamy congealed conception, it was well balanced, and so flavorful without the added cream that sometime comes with it.  We finished with the chocolate mousse and it was just the perfect closing to a very surprising meal.  We were leaving back to LA the next day and just wanted a place within walking distance and they delivered and made us feel at home.I think they knew we were out oft owners tooo because all I have were dark skinny jeans after I wore all of my dresses at the wedding events, but they didn't treat us any different.  I think though, I would dress up a little more if I ever get to go back...",4,3,3,Meghan D.,"Santa Monica, CA",278,120,2109

3.0,12/11/2016,"It's surprising how big RossIni's is. This venue is all about the atmosphere, which I would describe as old school New York. Say at our inward facing table it appeared to be packed with long time locals, with almost none of the younger crowd associated with the area. Unfortunately, the romance of this place wasn't enough for me to give it a better rating. The service was unfriendly (grumpy even), we regularly had to ask for things like water, pepper, silverware...and even then this often didn't turn up. We were asked to pick our wine without seeing the food menu. The menu was predominantly pasta, seafood and chicken, which I guess is expected for Italian. I went with a crap dish given we had ordered red wine already. I didn't notice as the time but the wine was actually a different year to what we ordered. To be fair, im not a wine connoisseur and i enjoyed it but a quick check online showed that the year advertised was a superb year and the year we got was lacking. I would say the food was nice but probably not worth what we paid for it.

4.0,12/3/2016,"Without knowing anything about Rossini's, I'd venture to gander the restaurant has a long standing in Murray Hill.  Overall, very traditional establishment... Walls decorated with photos of former patrons, you are required to check your coat, live music during dinner service, as well as a very formal waitstaff.  We enjoyed our meal here, but can't say it's much to brag about (for our liking). That absolutely doesn't make this place less than perfect... but we appreciate more American Italian, if you will.  So in this light, the $90 bill for one beer, soup, two pasta dishes, tax and tip seemed ridiculous.  Especially when I asked for a CUP of soup, and repeated myself three times that I only want the soup du jour IF its small (made a gesture and all). The interior is decorated beautifully; I loved the chairs for sure!  Given we visited Thanksgiving Weekend, we also had the pleasure of seeing the restaurant decorated for the holidays.

Started off with the fried calamari which was tasty, not the best I've ever has but definitely nowhere near the worst. I ordered the veal francese which was perfectly thing and wonderfully flavorful. My girlfriend got the Tortellini which was also delicious served in a thick cream sauce. For dessert we shared a piece of the chocolate mousse cake which was extremely good.

For my second course I chose the bolognese-I specifically asked the waiter if it was fresh pasta and he told me yes; The pasta was not fresh at all and the bolognese sauce was okay (at best). Still optimistic I waited for the turkey. First off-the cranberry sauce came out sliced on a plate, still in the mold of the can it came out of (insulting)!! The turkey was so dry: it tasted like it was cooked the day before and reheated right before serving. The vegetables on the side were frozen peas and carrots (gross), the stuffing tasted like stale bread with broth (tasteless), and the gravy was water. The worst was the supermarket pumpkin pie cut from the aluminum foil pie mold and served on a plate! It breaks my heart that from all the recommendations I had, that this is what I was given.

The calamari was done to perfection - tender, not greasy or over fried.  The Vitello alla Rossini comes in a delicious mushroom sauce that is not too rich or thick.  The rigatoni in pesto sauce was also excellent - a little heavy on the oil, but not objectionable - a very nice pesto.

I have been coming here for 15 years and most other people are locals. It is recommended by a lot of the hotels in the area as a low key Italian restaurant so you may meet a few out of towners at the bar. Most of the wait staff has been there for years and are knowledgeable about the menu if you have questions.

2.0,11/14/2013,"This is one of those restaurants that makes me want Yelp to allow half-stars because I really had a tough time deciding between two and three. I will start off by saying that the food certainly isn't bad. If this was my local, casual, and lower-priced Italian place, I would probably come back. What really knocks this down is that it tries to be so much more than that and consequently, I walked out feeling unsatisfied, overcharged, and disappointed.From the outside, Rossini's looks small but inviting. Once you walk down a hallway though,  it opens up into a surprisingly large dining room, complete with out-dated décor and a wait staff dressed in tuxedos. That was my first clue that this place had delusions of grandeur and fine dining. Before we had a chance to order, the singing started. They had two older singers and a piano accompaniment singing everything from ""God Bless America"" to opera and my entire table had to stifle their laughter because it felt like we were in the ""Godfather"".  They finally, and mercifully, stopped by the time our food came.As I said before, the food wasn't bad, but for the prices and atmosphere, I expected a lot better. I had Tortellini in a meat sauce. The pasta obviously wasn't fresh and if they're going to present themselves as a high-class old-school Italian Restaurant, using pasta I could have bought from the supermarket just won't do. And that was the general consensus from everyone at my table of five: it wasn't bad, but it wasn't good enough all things considered.The last thing I'll mention, which really irked my table, was how they filled our water glasses. I think they've been instructed to walk around and fill the glasses every time they see that the water isn't completely level with the top of the glass. They think it fits with the fine dining theme they're shooting for, but in reality it just leads to the annoyance of someone walking right in the middle of your conversation after every sip you take from your glass. I was there about an hour and a half total and they must have filled up my glass at least 20-25 times. Seriously, just stop. The bottom line is that you could get the same quality food for a lower price and in a less stuffy atmosphere, or you can get much better food in a better atmosphere for the same price.

The soup was nicely made with a good mix of veggies and it seemed like my friends enjoyed their appetizers as well, although the broccolini was a tad on the salty side.For our mains, we ordered the chicken, the pork medallions, and the veal scallops. I thoroughly enjoyed the veal which was served with mushrooms and in a nice cognac sauce. I surprisingly cleaned my plate, which rarely happens, so I give this dish two thumbs up! As for the chicken and pork, my friends weren't super excited about their dish - chicken was smothered in a bit too much cheese and spinach was too salty!Overall, it was an OK experience.

One of my gf had the sausage with spinach, and it was yummy.Entree: chicken with a buttered sauce with potatoes and spinach (chicken was tastey but the spinach was a little too salty for me).

3.0,8/1/2013,"I'd say this place is a solid 3.5 star, but I didn't round up since we only stopped by the bar for a beverage. Although, I will say judging by the old school, straight-outta-a-mafia-movie, Italian vibe was badass. I think I probably would have loved the food. But please take into consideration these things before you read on: - We came in pretty close to closing time- Only stayed for two glasses of wine at the bar- We're out of towners- And we love places we're not supposed to love (i.e. an older crowd, even though we're 20-somethings, hole-in-the-wall, off-the-beaten-path places... you get the point)If you're still reading, here's my take. This place is crazy cool. Outdated? Yes. But that's the charm! There are some many ""throw-back"" spots in Cleveland and we love it that way. And Rossini's just oozes with Italian, family-style authenticity. They're not trying to be trendy or something they are not. And you know, I like it when a place has history and knows who they are. I mentioned that we walked in close to closing time. On the way in, we passed a huge family leaving in a cloud of cigar smoke. At this point I knew it was going to be a legit experience. We parked it at the bar and I immediately noticed dark woods and lots of dark reds. Definitely an upscale, circa 1970s decor, but awesome, none-the-less. The kitchen was still cooking for the diners in the back of the restaurant and it smelled incredible. We ordered two glasses of their table wine (Chianti, I believe?) and the bartender let us know that even though it looked empty up front, we're more than welcome to stay and eat. So welcoming! And the pour... holy hefty glass of wine. Then she made a little small talk, found out we were from out of town and it was our anniversary. So, she poured us another glass, complimentary, in celebration. What a sweetie. Definitely kicking myself now for not trying the food, but that street vendor gyro at midnight was delicious... haha.",4,1,3,Cara L.,"Seattle, WA",5000,1083,4023
4.0,8/1/2013,"After years of passing it by and wanting to go, last night was my first trip to Rossini's. It had the look and feel of old country Italian from the outside of the building and the food and service did not fail.  Being that it is Restaurant Week, another reason to give it a try. The place is larger than I expected. We were seated in the main dining room and it was crowded with mix of all ages. As for the food. It was very good. From the stuffed clams, which was not heavy on breading but very clammy (in a good way), to the main course of veal medallions in a cognac sauce which was tender and juicy, to the huge cannoli as a dessert, the combination of all three dishes and the healthy bread basket with olive oil and butter made for a full and happy me.  The staff was very attentive and had a friendly flair which made the experience feel comfortable. It really takes you back to a time when dinner was considered an event and not just another meal. My friends also enjoyed the dining experience and what was best was there was no rush. We were able to dine and converse without the constant supervision of staff yet we noticed our drinks were always topped off or replenished without question. Even with the old world feel, it also felt very homey and upscale. Seems like a lot of the diners knew the staff as I saw many hugs and cheek kisses going around.

If you don't like manners, courtesy and being catered to, then this place is not for you.  The tuxedo-ed staff was constantly filling our water glasses, refolding our napkins for us when we left the table, holding the chair as they seated us and just pampered us.The place is deceptive from the outside.  If you peek in the window , it looks like a bar with a few tables for dining.  But there is a long hallway, and on the other side of the hallway are two giant dining rooms with a piano player.  The food was excellent.  I had veal saltimbocca and it was delicious.  Also, I was surprised to see that it was served with hard boiled egg on top of the veal and spinach.  I have not seen that in decades.  (I told you I'm old )As for decor, the other reviewers may be right when they say it is old fashioned.  I don't usually notice stuff like that so I am not in a position to say.  But if I were to say, I would say it is more elegant than old fashioned.  Not all restaurants will opt for the decor of an Applebee's just to get a more hip crowd.  I do know that everything was super clean, elegant, and the food and service were top notch.  Even the hand towels in the rest room were monogrammed.Our dining companions were in their late twenties and loved the food and the old school dining experience.  They said that it was a little pricey, but they will be coming back.Between the wonderful Broadway show and the Rossini dining experience, it was a wonderful day in NYC.",5,2,4,Jay D.,"Lodi, NJ",3,64,1

4.0,5/11/2013,"I have frequented Rossini's since the late 80's.  The food is consistently good.I also like that I can get into this restaurant anytime. Never had to wait.Sure I wish the decor would be updated, but the food and service make up for that.  I am not a fan of the opera singers on Sat. night, but perhaps the regulars like it, it can be an interesting experience for any new customers I suppose.This trip I had the Osso Bucco.  The meat fell off the bone when the dish was placed in front of me. It was so tender. I love their brown sauce too. I'll almost take any dish with this sauce.Always love going here to eat every time I stay in the Murray Hill area.Highly recommend.",0,0,0,Yonita L.,"Seattle, WA",26,43,10
4.0,3/26/2013,"I really like this place. If you want old-school Italian food well-prepared and well-served, it works. Yes, it's fusty but for some folks that's ok. It's quiet and one can have a conversation while eating good, reasonably priced food.",0,1,0,Evelyn B.,"New York, NY",0,31,0
2.0,3/13/2013,"Went there with my girlfriend for dinner last week.  The staff was friendly but a little slow.  The special spicy linguine with seafood was good not great.  The seafood was very fresh but the sauce wasn't spicy or particularly flavorful.  The gnocchi bolognese was outstanding.  Everyone in there is pretty old, but we weren't really looking for a scene.  My problem came when they brought us the bill and had doubled all of the appetizers and entres.  They marked us down for two of each.  We brought it to their attention and they took off the double counted appetizers and brought the bill back still with 2x each entre.  They then fixed that, but it didn't leave me with a good feeling.  Keep an eye on the check when you get it.",1,0,0,Brian N.,"Manhattan, NY",1,25,0
2.0,2/21/2013,"Went here for Valentine's Day, and when we walked in, I realized that we were the only ones under 75 years old. Get it gramps! I felt like I stepped into an Italian restaurant straight out of The Sopranos. Old, tacky decor from the late 80s, bright lighting, weird carpeting. It's definitely catered towards an older crowd. I decided to give it a chance though, since I didn't want to ruin our night. Here's what I thought:Pros:Hearty Italian comfort food, hefty glasses of wine, polite staff, live piano music, fairly decent prices for what you getCons:Outdated, low service; took at least 25 minutes to get our menus and water, SO bright!, ambiance is not their forte, not for 20-30-somethingsMy boyfriend seemed to LOVE the place though (old at heart?), so I'm sure he'll drag me back here, but it's not something I'd come back to on my own.",1,1,0,Christine S.,"Manhattan, NY",46,165,2
5.0,2/16/2013,"Rossini is a fabulous place to get some good Italian food. It is pricey, but its worth it. When we went, the two opera singers were there, and we stayed for a good 3 hours because they were so nice to listen to. The food is very good, and its classic Italian. The interior is old fashioned and I loved it. The experience for us was one I will remember. I hope to return to Rossini's in the future.",0,0,0,Anthony D.,"Atlanta, GA",1309,251,42
2.0,2/1/2013,"The only reason for the two stars is the veal milanese.  Other than that, I would give it negative stars.  Went there on a lark.  Lived in the neighborhood 10 years and never went.  Now I know I was missing nothing.  The walls are covered with celebrity photos ranging from the cast of the Sopranos to 50 Cent.  Either they were all drugged, paid or went to an entirely different restaurant.  The primary ingrideint is salt.  The decor is something your 80 year old aunt thinks is dated.  If it were not for the great state of New Jersey, there would be no other diners.  Enough said.  Avoid at all cost, have the veal milanese if you are trapped here.  If they are out of veall, chew off your foot and escape.",3,4,2,Edward L.,"Manhattan, NY",0,1,0
3.0,1/22/2013,"Overall good experience. Decor and wait staff was generally, ""tacky"", and felt like I was on a cruise ship. Food was good, service equally good, and atmosphere was good. Don't expect a 45 minute dinner, this is more of an experience (1.5 - 2 hours). Dinner will add up fast with some wine and dessert, so bring your plastic. Nothing special to write home about and probably won't come back again. Better suited for the older crowd, not for 30-somethings.",1,0,0,Mark H.,"Denver, CO",4,117,0

4.0,8/9/2012,"Rossini's is a throwback to a time when going out for Italian food really meant something. They provide more than just a meal - they provide an experience and thankfully that experience, though not cheap, is routinely fantastic. Every dish that comes out of their kitchen has received the love and care one might expect from home cooking. And the presentation is right on the money - not too simple and not too garish - just perfect for the vibe this restaurant successfully creates. The wait staff is incredibly nice and attentive, and even the person who tends to the coat room is super-friendly. There aren't many gems in Murray Hill but Rossini's is one of them so check it out when you can.",0,0,0,Sloane W.,"Tenafly, NJ",6,84,0
3.0,7/28/2012,"I went to this place because there is the restaurant week and I was curious to try it, even if it was not very well noted. I have to admit that the pasta was good, but I don't think it deserves more than 2-3 stars in the complex, especially for the range price. I checked the menu and I found it quite expensive for what it offers: the service is not very good (our dishes and glasses where completely wet and we had to wait a bit to get the menu), the level of the noise is high, and the other courses were nothing special.... The Profitterol was terrible: it looked like it was perepared a few days before and the taste was insignificant. As I am italian I am very picky with italian restaurants, that's why I think that there are a lot of better restaurants and less expensive that this one in the city",0,0,0,Bebe M.,"Manhattan, NY",1,21,0
2.0,3/12/2012,"There's a reason why this restaurant, despite having been around for centuries, only has 11 yelp reviews.  It's because a majority of the patrons of this establishment likely don't even know about yelp... or the internet.  Ouch!If your idea of casual Sunday attire is a white button down, salmon-colored cashmere cardigan, and a professorial tweed blazer with suede elbow patches, this place might knock it out of the park for you.  If you're only spending $0.50 per subway ride, you might run into someone here that you knew from way back when.  If you carry around a flashlight to help you read menus, that flashlight might in fact reveal that this is the menu of your dreams!  If none of these criteria seem to fit, I would choose another restaurant.In this dungeon-like windowless dining hall, where soft jazzy piano music and the smell of garlic fill the air, there are, however, some redeeming glimmers of hope.  The shrimp bisque (""What is the soup de jour?  Mmm, that sounds good, I'll have that"") showed restraint and poise.  The mixed greens salad was fresh and nicely dressed.  The spaghetti carbonara was also very well-conceived.  Had the prices not exceeded the nymag review's menu's listed prices, I would have been a little less put off from the get go, and the solid mediocrity of the actual food might actually warrant 3 stars...That being said, this is New York, and you've come in search of nothing but the best.  Look elsewhere, my dear yelp friends, I implore you.",5,6,1,Evan W.,"Manhattan, NY",24,87,8

3.0,3/19/2011,"A group of us in town for business went here last night for dinner upon the recommendation of the hotel concierge. The restaurant reminded us of something you would see in a mob movie. I half expected to see a scary guy and his associates sitting at a corner table. But I digress..... I had the shrimp and asparagus risotto, my boss had a weird version of chicken parmesan that looked good, but unlike any we had ever seen. No marinara? What's that about? Everyone seemed happy with their meals, but I was not overwhelmed-especially for what we were charged. Unlike my fellow Yelpers, our food was properly cooked but the service was so slow. Friendly, but sllloooowwww. I am not sure if this was intentional (sit back, relax, enjoy your meal....) or if they were just being inattentive. It was nice to sit and talk, but by the end of the meal, we were tired and just wanted to go back to our hotel.

Listening to her was our first mistake.We ordered 2 glasses of the house red, and decided quickly on our meal choices because we were starving. I ordered the shrimp risotto, and sis had penne with sausage. My risotto was undercooked, and the shrimp were not edible: they were fishy, cold, and undercooked. I pushed the plate away immediately for fear of getting sick.The penne was nearly as bad, and when we called the waiter over to complain, he began cursing under his breath in Spanish as he walked away with our plates. He was still going when he brought us a $50 tab for the 4 glasses of (cheap) wine we drank, and my sister proceeded to let him have it in his native tongue. No, he didn't see that coming.We left angry and hungry--never a good combination.

The calamari was undercooked and came with a marinara sauce that was too watery to stick to the rings. The pasta dishes were bland, but not offensive. My friend's scallops - now THOSE were offensive. They smelled overly fishy and were super-salty - in other words, they were not good. They were sent back and she decided to not get anything to replace it. When the bill came, the final straw was seeing the $27 charge for the funky scallops. We protested and it was removed, though you could tell the staff were not happy about it.
