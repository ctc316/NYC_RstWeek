All the standards-- a mediocre burger, over sauced skate, limp salad.Ruhlmann says they serve dinner but that's questionable, maybe it's just cocktails with food since the bar closes at 9pm.

2.0,2/7/2019,"I wish I had a better report to make.  My colleagues and I were looking for a nice place to have dinner after a long day in meetings.  We wanted something near our Rockefeller Plaza office and decided to try this advertised as a french brassiere.  We were five persons and arrived on a Wednesday night at about 5:20-5:30 without a reservation.Good:  We were seated quickly and courteously in a pleasant corner with plenty of space.  Besides the regular menu, they were also offering a prix fixe Restaurant menu and a Wednesday night special of duck breast.  Nice.  Not-so-good:  The food, based on my experience and my colleagues', ranged from ""good"", ""not bad"" and ""poor.""  One person had the Filet, and he sat it was good, as was my crab cake appetizer, but the salmon on the prix fixe was only OK.  I had ordered the Paté de Champagne as a main, along with some haricot vert, but it was definitely not up to standard.  I've had store-bought pate' that was better than this and I ended up sending it back.  Now, even that wouldn't have been a deal-breaker.  It happens and they accepted it back without trouble.Poor:  The real problem was the service and the entire attitude of the staff.  When my colleague asked for the dressing on her Prix Fixe salad to be served on the side, the server said that there were ""no substitutions""!  We had to insist that she at least ask.  I'm not even sure she knew the menu properly, because the menu description was:  ""Asparagus & Bucheron Salad, white truffle vinaigrette, prosciutto"".  When it came, there were asparagus wrapped in the prosciutto as the main part of the dish.  My colleague didn't realize that this is what they meant by ""salad"", hence the dressing request.  If the server had paid attention she would have recognized that the guest probably didn't understand the nature of the ""salad"" and could have clarified this, perhaps resulting in cancelling the request.  Other issues were that, when I first got my pate, I asked if I could have some of the cranberry chutney that was supposedly on the side of the duck dish.  Again, the answer was a perfunctory, ""no"", with the server claiming that they only had enough portions of chutney for the number of duck for the night!  I requested that she at least ask the kitchen - the answer could still have been ""no"", but at least she would have tried.  I don't know if she asked or not, because when she returned quite a while later, she didn't talk to me at all.When I sent the pate back, they asked if I wanted anything else.  My colleagues were already eating their entrees, so when they brought the menu again I was ready to quickly pick something and move on.  Unfortunately the person who brought the menu (I believe it was the hostess) instantly disappeared and the server did not reappear for a long time.  I never did order anything else, so my main for the evening was an order of haricot vert.At dessert time, my colleague ordered coffee that never came.  Throughout the meal, each time something was served we were left alone for an extended period without anyone even subtly taking a look to see if we might need something.  My colleagues were all equally unimpressed, with one person insisting that we leave a very low tip in response.  As a former waiter, I hate to do that, but I couldn't really argue based on our experience.The bus staff were good and nice, but the rest of the staff was less than welcoming and seemed disinterested in taking the word ""hospitality"" seriously.  Then, to put a rotten cherry on top, as we were leaving I found the manager lurking near the door.  I checked he was the manager and then started to try to explain the poor experience we had had.  He was so spectacularly disinterested that, as my colleagues reached me at the door, I abandoned hope and didn't bother trying to go into more detail on the problems.  I really don't think he cared.Very disappointing.",0,0,0,Lou H.,"Manhattan, NY",0,13,0

1.0,12/22/2018,"I do not normally write restaurant reviews, but had to write this review. My husband and I went to Brasserie Ruhlmann for a nice evening out. We were seated in an area of the restaurant where we felt the cold air coming in and asked to be moved by the hostess. She said we could not be moved because she did not want to re-make the table we sat in. This comment should have been my cue to leave.  Then, my husband ordered an item from the menu and received other ingredients that were not listed on the menu, that he is allergic to. Thank goodness he noticed the extra food items in his meal.  The waitress had the nerve to defend the wording on the menu. We were not the only ones who did not have a good experience...the couple who sat down next to us walked out before ordering their meal. I would not recommend this restaurant. The service is the worst I have ever seen and I have been to a lot of the fine dining restaurants all over the world.  The food is mediocre at best.

4.0,12/20/2018,"I came here for a business lunch last week.  This is an upscale French brassiere, across the street from 30 Rock.  This place is popular at lunch, so I would recommend either coming early or getting a reservation as when I walked in, the place was packed.I had the steak frites and my colleague had a salad with Chicken.  I was in the mood for steak frites, but after I ordered, I feared a giant slab of skirt steak would appear on top of a mound of fries and I would pass out when I got back to the office.  Thankfully, the dish was a perfect lunch portion - I would guess it was a 6 oz. steak (with a side of bearnaise) and about a large fist full of fries and some watercress.  The service was good, too.  They were attentive but did not hover and make us feel rushed to get out so they could turn the table.  One bit of caution, it is not cheap, so don't complain about prices.  Definitely a great place for a celebratory lunch or business meeting.",1,1,1,Dan C.,"New York, NY",989,942,532
3.0,12/18/2018,"Great location, right across from Rockefeller Center and perfect view of the tree. I attended dinner with a few family members on Saturday night and being vegetarian they were unable to offer one vegetarian dish. I even asked if I could pair some plain pasta or rice with their side dish vegetables and I was told no. Everything included meat on the menu and they told me they were unable to remove the meat from any dish. I was only offered to eat sides that were potato and vegetable choices. I've never been to a restaurant (especially in NYC) that doesn't offer at least 1 vegetarian dish. Truly disappointing that they don't offer a dish option for vegetarian/vegan/gluten free/etc. For NYC they really need to offer something other than just sides to choose from",0,0,1,Samantha T.,"Andover, NJ",99,3,2

4.0,11/26/2018,"Our family of four ate here on Thanksgiving day while visiting NYC.  We arrived a few minutes early and the hostess graciously seated us.  We had a perfect view of the tree outside on the plaza (they can't guarantee this, so I guess we were lucky). The restaurant is very lovely with its Art Deco decoration.The food was absolutely delicious.  I loved the salmon, my son enjoyed the chicken with pommes frites, my husband liked the Ruhlmann salad and a side of jalapeno mashed potatoes and my daughter had the Thanksgiving dinner special which was ok, but not fantastic.  While we all enjoyed our meals I think I liked mine the most.  The salmon was absolutely delicious and the plain mashed potatoes were magnificently smooth and delicious.  For dessert my daughter ordered the cookie plate which was glorious. It's a plate of two each of about seven wonderful little morsels. My son had the apple tart and said it was very good--and it's hard to get much of a food compliment out of him.The service was very good with someone always on hand to ask if we needed anything else, to fill our water, or to clear.  This was a costly meal, but the food was very good and considering the location was to be expected.

I was told that they would not give us a reservation for December 11 because we were 5 people.  There is new management and now only tables of 4 or less are accepted.  I spoke to the manager and he was very cold and said no tables for five people that week.  The hostess should have mentioned that inane rule on the previous 2 calls for a reservation instead of just snottily saying I had to wait until 21 days ahead.  Obviously we will not be going back there for our annual Christmas Tree get together.",1,0,1,Jennifer B.,"New York, NY",0,1,0

3.0,9/2/2018,"Pros...in the heart of Rockefeller center, so A+ for location; outdoor dining.  Cons...Food was ok, but for the $$ not a solid relative value.  Drinks could be a bit tastier...just no real ""craft"" from the bar...especially for the $.  It's supposed to be French dining, but I honestly couldn't tell by any of the general finesse from the cook of my steak or the sauces that came with it...béarnaise isn't that difficult, and this one needed help.  The shrimp were cooked well and tasty...too marks for the tempura as it was light and airy, but was a rip on ""firecracker"" shrimp you can get at many chains...just do something enlightened with the sauce or something.Crab cake was solid and full of crab, no complains there.  Finally the tuna carpaccio...this was the best thing there... who knew, solid sashimi at a French(?) restaurant.",1,0,0,Jeffrey L.,"Houston, TX",93,128,313
3.0,8/29/2018,"I am rating the outdoor Biergarten, not the restaurant, which I love for a good burger and outdoor eating. I'm kind of torn about my review because my first experience here was so good. My second, not so much. My friend ordered a burger. She asked for no tomato because she's allergic. The waitress said, ""sorry, you cannot order it without the tomato"".  Ok, so I thought that was weird but ok, they have a certain menu that they don't have time to make special orders. I get it. It can get very busy at the lunch hour. At this particular time, it was not at all crowded. My other friend then ordered a salad and asked for the salad dressing on the side. Again, no can-do. She ordered the salad anyway and a pretzel. I ordered a burger medium rare with french fries. ""Sorry, all burgers are served medium and no fries"". OK, we were moments away from ditching and going to Del Frisco's Grill across the corridor but I had to get to a meeting and we had already been sitting for about 15 minutes. Another friend ordered bratwurst and chips with cheese and jalapeños. With all the confusion, I suggested the waitress write down our orders. She said no no, I've got everything. Sure enough, no salad, no bratwurst and no chips with cheese and jalapeño. Would I come back? Yes because the burger was good but now I know that my burger comes with chips, not fries. Also, my iced tea was Snapple iced tea. It was not orange iced tea which the waitress said but now I'm nit-picking. I want to give the Biergarten 4 stars but I just can't. I recommend as long as you know going in, don't deviate from the set menu. Special orders do upset them. Even McDonald's you can order a burger without pickles. Maybe our waitress was new. She was very nice and very sweet. I'm sure she's just following orders but next time, if there's more than two people in the party, jot it down, especially if the group is asking a lot of questions.",0,0,0,Lily C.,"Islip, NY",35,461,428

Easy to get seats since the place was pretty empty on an early Saturday evening. The food was pretty good though yes, a bit pricey. I had the salmon, which was really good and I finished my whole meal. For dessert, the best was the chocolate dish - the creme brulee with passion fruit did not have that nice layer of hardened sugar on top, which was disappointing. They did forget the creme brulee at first but multiple people apologized and brought it out asap.In the end, the service was friendly enough and the food was pretty good so why not go if I am in the area and need a bite to eat?

When I woke up this morning To my hungry tummy rumbling, I immediately flashed back to  how neither of us could finish our lobster bisque as the  flavor was so off- no sherry is what it seemed like To us and the other terrible dishes. The apple tart looked like my favorite tart I have had many times in Italy and France- except this one was blackened on the bottom and so burned on top that we only found small bites to pick off and eat. Disappointed that they served it and more disappointed that I was cheated out of a delicious dessert. The mojito and earl grey tea were winners.

4.0,5/17/2017,"Stopped by on a Tuesday, 4/18/2017 around 2pm or so.  It was the first nice day in a long while so it was still crowded.  Luckily, we were able to get a table outside.  Warning: on a hot day, the sun is still pretty strong, not a lot of shade.We had a Croque Monsieur, $25, a French classic, it was tasty! Great balance of cheese and ham!  It comes with Salad with not too much dressing, and order of fries.We also had the Grilled Salmon, $31, came over a bed of cous cous that was very tasty.  Very light sauce that complemented the Salmon. Also ordered a side, Tomato Provencale, $10.  It's basically tomato with herbs and bread crumbs on top.  I would probably not get this again and save the $10.Overall, this is a nice lunch spot.  I felt like I was paying more for the location  than the food.  I think that if you have this mindset, then you won't be disappointed in a $125 lunch for 2 people, with one glass of wine each.Pro Tip: if you go during lunch time, see if there is a shaded area, if it's a warm day, you may want to sit inside, pretty nice also.Enjoy!!",2,0,0,Paul K.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",394,75,136

I've eaten French cuisine all over the city and this was really the worst so far. I'll start with the good- easy stuff like drinks and oysters = good. The rest- we ordered two apps white asparagus and beet salad. Both pretty tasty but hollandaise sauce was separating, meaning not properly prepared. I ordered the ruhlmann salad: one word, ICEBERG lettuce!! Any restaurant that even stocks that in the pantry is off my list. And this was a $30 salad! My family ordered the lamb shank and it was typical crockpot braised in wine. Tasted like it was prepared the day before and reheated. The chef was definitely not in house!!

1.0,4/15/2017,"I'm so disappointed with how we were treated the last time we went to this place. I really only go here 3-4 times a year when my mother visits as I've always found this place underwhelming and mainly a tourist/bridge-and-tunnel joint - sorry but I call it like I see it. And we won't be going back. Ever.This past winter holiday season we popped in as usual - hoping to sit in the bar area and order a bottle of wine and a few appetizers. It was three of us and kind of a winter tradition. We brave the crowds, see the Tree and treat ourselves to a decent bottle of wine, oysters, etc etc. usually dropping 250-300 bucks in less than an hour. Pricey but not completely unreasonable for the decent wine list and location. This time we were asked not to sit at the ""reserved"" table (not marked) in the bar area and that the other two tables were reserved. You don't ""reserve"" tables in the bar area - which is separate from the dining rooms. I've worked for and with high-net worth individuals my entire career - I know we weren't the clientele they were looking to have that Friday. We weren't dressed for the evening - despite the fact that it wasn't even past 6pm. I spoke with the front of house person who said that not only did they not have any available tables but weren't even allowing walk-ins, meaning we wouldn't even be allowed to wait for a table. This isn't Jean-George dude. It's a mediocre tourist trap. Priced accordingly. Sad-oddly-pretentious staff. Pass on this place.

Not mad about it because I didn't check their actual website). My issue with service was that I went to pick up 8 minutes before 5:30 and was told rather haughtily that my food would've ready in exactly 8 minutes. Nothing wrong with my food being ready when they said it would be, but the attitude was unhelpful. The servings also looked rather small to me.

4.0,3/26/2017,"I returned to Brasserie Ruhlmann on a Saturday evening for a fourth visit with a 7:30 pm Opentable reservation. When we arrived, the hostess informed us that our table was ready. I certainly hoped so considering that only two tables in the restaurant were occupied at the time. We were seated and given menus. Five minutes later we were offered water. Five minutes after that we were presented with bread, butter, and cheese puffs. However, no one came over to take any drink orders or discuss daily specials etc. A couple of minutes later, the host (manager?) came over to take a drink order.  A couple of minutes later our waitress arrived. After that point, the service was impeccable. Not sure why it took so long to get things going. As for the food; one of our appetizers was the Boston Lettuce with Shallots, Chives, and Mustard Vinaigrette. This salad also had either anise or fennel because it had a distinct licorice flavor. It was delicious.The other appetizer was the Bigeye Tuna Tartare with yuzu, soy, and olive oil vinaigrette. Also delicious. One of our entrees was the Lapin ala Moutarde (Rabbit in mustard sauce) with pasta, pearl onions and mushrooms. It was excellent. The other entree was the Roasted Chicken with  Herbs De Provence, shoestring potatoes and roasted tomatoes. This is one of the best chicken dishes I have ever had anywhere! The herb flavor not only was in the skin but in the chicken itself. The herbs were extensive but the primary herb was rosemary. The shoestring potatoes were fantastic and that green thing on the bottom is one of the roasted tomatoes also with herbs. They also had additional herbal juice on the side. This dish was amazing! Dessert was Bittersweet Chocolate Cake which was also excellent. Coffee was excellent as well as was the Newton Chardonnay. At 9:30 pm when we were leaving no other tables were occupied. This is surprising since this restaurant has outstanding food and exemplery service in a beautiful art deco space with prices that are reasonable given the quality. One suggestionf for the management, however, is to have the staff ask about food allergies/sensitivities when ordering. A day after dining here I had an outbreak of acne which can occur if I have food that is cooked in peanut oil. It is possible that either the chicken or the wonderful potatoes might have had peanut oil. It's not a serious issue for me, but just a suggestion to the management since they are very aware of gluten issues based on their menu.

4.0,1/10/2017,"Location, location! That is what they say is most important. Well this place meets that requirement.I was touring the Rockefeller Center area with my family during the Christmas holidays. Last year we had a very nice lunch here, therefore, my party of nine decided to return here again for lunch a little after 12 noon without a reservation on a Thursday. I was elated to find that they were able to arrange a table for my party of nine within a couple of minutes after we arrived. It was a cold wintry day. Most of us checked our coats.  We were seated near the entrance revolving door. I started with their $15 jalapeno margarita, which I enjoyed last year. The bourbon cider was also $15. I also ordered the $26 assorted nigiri with salmon, yellow tail, red snapper and spicy tuna. It was more like an appetizer, but, fine for me since I was not so hungry. The others in my party enjoyed their $38 halibut, $34 hanger steak, $30 lobster roll and four $26 croque Monsieur/Madame sandwiches. The Madame served with an egg on top of the sandwich cost an extra $1. Their house wines ranged $12-$15 per glass. Our total bill less gratuities was $428 for lunch. Panagiota did a very nice job of serving our large table. The service here was as good as last time. My only three complaints about this restaurant is that, since we did not have a reservation we were seated near the entrance on a cold winter day. Every time someone entered the restaurant the cold freezing air would whisk through our table. My second gripe was that there is only one urinal in the men's restroom with only two sinks to wash your hands. Also neither the women's or men's restrooms have any baby changing tables. Despite these minor issues, I will likely continue to return here for some more good food and service. Welcome to NYC.    Monday to Friday from 5pm to 7pm specialty cocktails are only $9.

Almost every time someone passed behind me, they bumped into my chair, even though the front legs of the chair were touching the base of the table and could not be moved any closer. The waitstaff never excused themselves or apologized for bumping me. The service was mostly inattentive. But what happened as we were about to order food has turned me away from ever returning. We overheard a waitress tell the two elderly women seated next to us, as she returned their change from their check, that the gratuity was not included in the bill. The women looked confused and my friend and I were aghast. I suggested that they take their change and not leave any gratuity. (This coming from a me, a notorious over-tipper). Being from another country where tipping is not customary, they asked us what the tip should be. My friend told them 18 - 20%, but not to leave that much because it was inappropriate for the waitress to say that to them. They said they wanted to do the right thing and leave the correct tip. We struck up a conversation and they told us they were visiting from Scotland celebrating their 65th birthdays. They were excited to be in New  York, but were very tired from the time difference and mostly just wanted to go to their hotel to rest. I felt so bad for them to be in ""my city"" and be treated so rudely while they were here for a special occasion.

It was a lovely brasserie, white table clothes, booths, and with good light where we could see the flags whipping in the wind around Rockefeller Center and watch the bonnets go by....and the FOOD! One friend and I shared an order of the pancakes with blueberries, which came with a bit of strawberries, a dollop of cream and a spring of mint and were delicious, and plenty for 2 of us. At $14 they would have been a decent NY price but split it was cheap. Other friend ordered an omelet which was also very good. The coffee with hot milk that I ordered was delicious, although they did charge my friend $1.50 for a cup of hot water (no tea bag!) which we thought was ridiculous...since cold water is free!Other than that, the waiter, service was very good and they let us sit and talk without bringing the check until we asked for it, which is always great.

3.0,12/24/2015,"Currently having Christmas Eve lunch at brasserie. To sum up the dining experience here - average food fluffed up because of the location, and not so friendly service. Started the meal off quite unhappy because I asked a waiter to take a photo for us, and he walked off immediately with an annoyed look mumbling ""wait a second"", and of course, never came back. This isn't quite the service you'd expect at a fancy restaurant especially when the place was only 60% full and not busy... But again, I think it's just fancy for its location that makes it seem a lot nicer than the food and service actually lives up to. In terms of food, the crab cake appetizer was pretty good, and for main courses we had the 11oz steak, the chicken, and the lobster roll. For all of these entrees, they came with a cup of sauce. Without the sauce, the entrees were really quite below average. Ingredients were not fresh and always a little too dry. Also, everything was really overpriced and portions were small.

3.0,12/20/2015,"Incredibly expensive however the food was quite good.  The cost perhaps was a little more due to the location....tley are located right next to the tree in Rockefeller Center. I ordered the hanger steak frites. The accompanying sauce was to die for. Why am I only getting it at three? I feel it was overpriced. In addition, they charged an additional three dollars when my son substituted fries for mashed potatoes. It's not a lot of money however it's tacky and it's the principle. In addition, they attempted to charge $10 for a bottle of sparkling water that was neither ordered nor received. I don't think I would return due to the fact that the value wasn't there.",0,0,1,Dave G.,"Rockville Centre, NY",1,64,0

Nice presentation though.Mussels was too small and NOT fresh. However, I do like the white wine sauce. So we ended up are a few pieces of mussels and ate all the bread for sauce dipping. Fries was cold and soggy.No time to order more food because it took too long for the food to be served especially for lunch hour. Nice sparkling water though. Ordered 2 bottles which cost $20.

2.0,8/28/2015,"If you want really good, expensive food, with exceptional service that it worth it then I suggest you walk across the street to Del Frisco's Grille because you sure won't find it at this place. Some friends & I were walking around midtown a few days ago and decided to stop and grab a bite to eat and some drinks. I recommended that we try Brasserie Rulhmann, I never been here and wanted to give it a shot. When we first stepped inside it looked really old and boring but we weren't there for the decor we wanted to eat ! After being seated and waiting over 15 mins to be seen we decided to move out doors. It was a beautiful day out and we wanted to enjoy the weather. My friends and I ordered the crab cake and lobster bisque for starters. Crab cake was alright, it taste alil over cooked if you ask me and I didn't even touch the lobster bisque it just didn't look appealing to me. The waiter brought over bread to the table. It was hard as a rock and I'm not exaggerating either. I had to stop eating it because I was afraid I would either get stuck down my throat or my tooth would chip. Anyways, as we we're sitting there ""Trying"" to enjoy or food and bottle of wine ( which was probably the only decent thing there, and that being because it came out of a bottle and not brasserie rulhmann's kitchen ) I over hear one of the managers yelling at the waiters. I couldn't believe what was going on. He's yelling at them telling them to move faster and grabbing plates out of their hands so rudely. I even caught him telling one of them to just get out of here as he brushes him off like he would to move a fly and then the manager proceeded by rolling his eyes & huffing and puffing. I was disgusted. The manager was this small Asian man who seem to be taking him self a little too serious. The restaurant wasn't even that busy for the way he was pushing these workers and the way he was speaking to them made me and my friends very uncomfortable. For a second I didn't know if I was at a restaurant or boot camp. I started to say something to the manager but my friend suggested I stay out of it. She was worried that it would get the waiter more in trouble. Finally me and my friends just asked for the check and wanted to hurry out of there as soon as possible. Brasserie Rulhmann it's sad that not only is your food not all that great but you also have to listen to management treating their employees like animals in front of patrons. My advice is that management keep that off the floor where customers can see. I will not step foot back in that place again. I just hope that the workers find a better work environment, no one deserves to get treated like that. Oh and I was being nice when I gave this place 2 stars. It deserves -5 in my opinion.",3,0,0,Evelyn B.,"Manhattan, NY",0,1,0
2.0,8/25/2015,"I love everything about this cafe except for the ridiculous lunchtime hostess. Unfortunately who greets you first in a business has a lasting effect which tinges the rest of your experience. Came here several weeks ago with my mom after a business meeting at the famous art auction house that is Brasserie Ruhlmann's neighbor. Just because we aren't wearing a business suit doesn't mean we don't have valuable business additionally we're scoping out a place for a large dinner after a very important art event.Here's some advice for the hostess, don't judge people in NYC with your silly snooty attitude and with what you think represents classy behavior. As we came in we said we didn't have a reservation, but you asked us again do you have a reservation. No smile no welcome just do you have a reservation. No we said we didn't. You called over the waitress and told her in French to seat us at table soixante huit or something to that effect which turned out to be the table right by the front door with all three- managers and hostess derrieres turned towards us a foot away from our table. Lots of other tables open in the restaurant.  As well, It's nice if a hostess realizes that your older mom would do better in a quieter corner than in the grand central station tourist location. Well she didn't. My mom and I decided to either ask for another table or leave. The nice maitre d' reseated us at a large booth in the quiet part of the restaurant and we had a decent brasserie meal. Not a blow it out of the park gastronomical experience. That's ok with me, I am good with dependable. What I love about European brasseries is that they are staffed with professionals not phony wanna be NYers putting on airs while doing their job improperly. That's not what my city is about, and the influx of attitude over service and familiarity is just so sub par. Here's a link to an old art world haunt-nytimes.com/1992/06/27/a…where all were welcomed. I went here with my parents as a child and it was magical.Brasserie Ruhlmann could be that too, please get some real people seating your clients who might have the brains to figure out not to judge people in our great city with their middle class mindset i.e. a suit makes you important.",1,0,0,Kat B.,"New York, NY",0,8,1

I don't think they have assigned tables so there was a bit of miscommunication among staff about what tables needed what. For instance, after receiving a steak knife after I ordered my food another waiter walked over about five minutes later with a steak knife and said, ""oh you already got one. I'm sorry.""

It had choices of meat and shellfish, neither of which I can eat. The online menu had advertised salmon. I requested to be accommodated for my food restrictions, especially since the online menu had been misleading. I was told that I would have to pay full price if I ordered even one item differently than what was on the prix fixe menu. I suggested that I would take twoappetizers on the prix fixe menu instead of the main, but was rebuffed.

1.0,7/26/2014,"This review is for the LT Biergarten at the Brassarie Ruhlmann at Rockefeller Center. There is no separate page for the Biergarten on Yelp.  My parents, visiting from out of town, wanted a place to grab some drinks with me and my girlfriend before we went to the Top of the Rock. We saw this little outdoor area (not to be confused with the restaurant's regular outdoor seating), and figured we'd give it a shot.The first 30 seconds started out okay. We went to the hostess stand and asked for a table of 4. The place was empty with the exception of 2 other tables occupied and the 4 staff members, including a well-dressed manager. Once we were seated, the quick descent to unbearable customer service began.First off, each table has a label-maker-printed table number stuck on the corner of each. I've worked in restaurants with 50+ tables. This place had maybe 15. If the staff can't remember the 15 table numbers, you have a problem. Not exactly fine dining. Ok, no big deal.We order our drinks and mention we will order food once drinks get there. The waitress comes back with 3 drinks and 3 glasses, but tells me they ran out of the beer I ordered. I notice that they only checked the outside bar in the beer garden area, but never went inside to check. Ok, I order another beer. She comes back with it, quickly sets the bottle on the table without giving me a glass, and runs off without taking our food order. I wait 3 minutes and can't catch her eye, despite there only being TWO other tables with people in the whole place. She is just hanging out at the bar with the other staff talking. I get up, walk over to the bar, and ask for a glass from the bartender.So we wait 5-10 minutes and the waitress still does not come over to take a food order. I look over at the bar and there she is messing around on her cellphone in full view of the manager. I get up, I walk over to her and tell her we still want to order food. She just says ""Oh, okay"" with no apology. Awesome.We order a pretzel for the table and some chips. 10 minutes later, the food comes out via the food runner. The waitress never comes to check on us. She's still too busy chatting with the other staff at the bar. I have to get up and walk across the restaurant area to get mustard for the pretzel.I then I realize we don't have plates, so I get up to the bar and ask for plates from the bartender who is next to the manager. They both give me a look like I just asked for a full body massage with happy ending. The manager laughs and goes ""This is a biergarten. There are no plates. But we can go get you some"". I say ""not if it's too much of a trouble"" and then return to my seat. The plates never came. I was not aware that this was an authentic biergarten that doesn't provide plates. I was also not aware that an authentic biergarten runs out of beer and has:- Metal patio tables with table numbers printed on them- A sound system consisting of 1 speaker, an ipod dock, and an ipod playing top 40 music that skips every 10 seconds- A staff and manager that doesn't pay attention to the 3 tables they have- Generic Grey Poupon mustard for their small pretzelsBUT, the manager was well dressed.We ultimately had to wait another 20 minutes after we were done eating before the waitress finally came over so we could ask to get the check. In that time, we had empty glasses. Then, another 10 minutes goes by before the bartender, not our waitress, even gets us the check. I could see the POS machine just 20 feet from our table!We quickly put a card down and have to wait another 10 minutes for that same bartender to come get it. She then says ""Oh, we don't take Discover"", throws the check back down on the table and walks away. We put another card down quickly and have to wait another 5 minutes before she comes back over. She runs the card and finally gives us the check, complete with full charges on all items and no comps. Then, out of nowhere, our original waitress returns and starts busing the table while I'm signing the check.I leave the $1 tip and my family and I get out of there.It's one thing if you have a busy night, it's another thing to be chatting with coworker, playing on your cellphone and ignoring your 2-3 tables in the entire restaurant.

3.0,7/25/2014,"food: 3decor: 3service: 4overall: 3I came here for restaurant week and was fairly disappointed in my experience. for starters I had the chilled soup. it wasn't bad, but it wasn't great either. sort of tasted like chilled pasta sauce in a good way? for my entree I was debating between the mussels and the hanger steak, but I opted for the mussels and my friend ordered the hanger steak. the mussels were pretty good and came in a sizable portion. but again it didn't impress me.. it was something you could easily get elsewhere. when I saw my friends hanger steak, I was so glad I didn't order that bc it was literally 4 small slices of steak, not an actual steak. it didn't taste bad though, and it was cooked exactly to our liking. we both ordered the profiteroles for dessert, which was the best part of the meal. I've had profiteroles before and i would rank this on the better half. overall, this place didn't wow me. we filled ourselves up with extra servings of bread.. like two or three refills. oh and guess what? even the bread was little.. lol",2,0,2,Jane C.,"New York, NY",50,87,46
1.0,7/24/2014,Seriously disappointing service. So slow. We waited for over an hour just for appetizers. And the portion size was small for the price we paid! The only reason I am giving this place one star is because I can't give it zero.,2,0,0,Lisa S.,"Hartford, CT",0,4,0

My rating is for the patio closest to the door (there are two with differing menus). Our table had a burger, steak and frites, and a lobster roll. The food was hot, prompt, and very flavorful. I particularly pay attention to sauces and felt theirs were well above average. Really though, it was the ability to sit outside at Rockefeller Center in perfect weather that took this from very good to great.  The prices could be lower, (24$ for a burger) but again, you are essentially renting the table.",0,0,0,Ethan K.,"Washington, DC",3,7,0
3.0,7/13/2014,"Wish it were possible to give 3.5 stars, because this place was definitely better than average but just not quite a 4. My husband and I went here on a beautiful Saturday night, and specifically picked this restaurant because of it's al fresco dining option. The outside dining area is big, but there are A LOT of tables packed in there so if I had to get up to use the restroom it required other diners to move their seats so I could get through. But, the view was nice and it was perfect for people watching in Rockefeller plaza. For food, we weren't too impressed with our appetizers - cocktail shrimp and lobster bisque - the shrimp was tough and the bisque lacked flavor. However, our main course was delicious. We ordered the short ribs with mashed potatoes and also a side of brussel sprouts with bacon. The entire dish was super tasty. The short ribs melted in your mouth and were full of flavor. My favorite part of the meal was definitely the brussel spouts ... these are a MUST ORDER. The other thing worth mentioning for our experience, was that the service was supurb. They were very attentive - numerous waiters, assistants and management checked in on us through out our meal. Would recommend to visit at least once, but with so many options in NYC we didn't love it enough to go back before trying somewhere new.",0,0,0,Elizabeth O.,"West New York, NJ",3,15,3
4.0,7/10/2014,"Riddle me this:  What is a French restaurant with sushi on its menu doing, opening a German beer garden in the Rockefeller Plaza promenade?  I have no answer, all I know is that there is now an out door biergarten steps away from my office.  It is summer, and I do not need to know more beyond this simple fact.   You'll find it following a shopping excursions, right after drooling at the elaborate works of art featured in the Anthropologie window displays, in the path leading into the Rockefeller center. With far more accessible pricing than Ruhlmann proper, this cute mini beer garden is a new and hidden gem in a bustling tourist location.  An oasis of sorts where you can order beers, bratwurst, and ridiculously addictive chips.  Happy hour beers are $5 from 4-6pm.  For a more special occasion at the restaurant proper, consider ordering the profiteroles, and indicate it is for a special celebration.  They come in a heaping mountain of golf-ball sized scoops of vanilla ice cream nestled firmly between two delicate pastry puff shells.  If you're lucky, it may also come with a sampling on either end of their summer meringue dessert, which can be ordered separately.  The meringue, unlike the hardened sugary shell that is initially conjured in your mind, is a light, foamy frothy creation served over rhubarb and strawberry compote sauce.  A perfectly light dessert to enjoy outside with a view of Rockefeller Center, and perhaps whichever Public Art Fund spectacle is on display at the moment.",4,3,3,Lu H.,"New York, NY",1218,411,1977

4.0,7/10/2014,"This could go three stars or four, I will give it four because of the mostly excellent service we received. The 3.5 average seems right to me.I have been here four or five times for business lunches over the years, but chose this for a July dinner as we were going to a concert at Radio City. It's a very convenient choice if that is your destination. The decor is good and my out of town friends liked the ""real NYC"" feel of the place.With our drinks, we received a gougere. The passion fruit mojito was tasty. Rolls and butter are also offered.For apps, my friends went with a lobster bisque and a cheese board. I had the crab cake - fresh, correct temperature, nice slaw, but underwhelming seasoning. My friend's cheese board was a nice presentation, and the brie type cheese I tasted was excellent. Didn't sample the lobster bisque, but there were no complaints. A good-looking shrimp cocktail was spied - perhaps that would have been a wiser choice.We had a medium priced bottle of Sauvignon Blanc with our main courses. I believe it was the Villa Maria-quite nice.One friend enjoyed his branzino over couscous, but I gave my other friend a bum steer with the hangar steak - a small portion of a not very expensive cut. I went with a special of grilled swordfish served over cucumber noodles and a puree of avocado. Medium sized, nice presentation, but it could have been more flavorful.We had room for desserts, my friends plumped for the apple tart, and I the bittersweet chocolate cake. These were better than the courses preceding.Our waiter's attentions were augmented by a hostess, and service was close to five star. Then again, it was an early reservation and the restaurant was not yet full.Given the level of service and the Rockefeller Center location, I don't think the prices are especially high - I do wish the kitchen took a bit more care with seasoning. I prefer this place for a business lunch in the cold weather, when a roast chicken or perhaps a choucroute garnie would appeal.

Beautiful, restaurant, directly across from Rockefeller center, outside seating, we were able to get a table for 17 immediately. Food terrible, service most, I cannot even find the words to describe how gross this place was. $30 steak all grizzle, soup flavorless, chicken way dry over cooked. But worst of all we were a large group that should have been on separate checks 7 different checks we expressed this at the beginning of being seated several times- the bill comes at it was combined over $500 the wait staff apologized but told us they could not change it. We were all using separate credit cards. This was a mess we were held there for over an over waiting to pay a bill on food that was terrible. We told our server the good was terrible, the manager stopped by while we were trying to eat and we showed him the fatty steak and told him the food was bad.

1.0,5/2/2014,"Had lunch here with my daughter on May 1, 2014. Nice location in Rockefeller Plaza. We ate outdoors on a lovely Spring day. This is very pretty restaurant with a very attentive staff, but I was completely unimpressed with the food - and isn't that what's most important when you go out to eat??!!We started off with the mushroom risotto - very good flavor and cooked perfectly, but obviously filled with dehydrated mushrooms that were so rubbery it felt like I had chewing gum in my mouth. For my entree I chose the Steak Frites - which was a simple flank steak. It was seasoned well but extremely small even by lunch menu standards. I found it highly amusing that they cut it up into about 4-5 sections so they can spread it across the plate to make it look bigger. It came with a few lettuce leaves on the plate with dressing (I guess that was supposed to be a side salad???) and shoestring fries that were overfried and encrusted with massive quantities of salt - so much salt I thought maybe there was parmesan cheese sprinkled on these fries until I tasted them - nope, not parmesan, just salt. Do yourself a favor and skip these fries as french fries are 10x better at McDonalds - I kid you not!  My daughter ordered the Croque Monsier - which was basically a grilled ham and cheese sandwich with an egg on top. The greasiness of this entree was off the charts, and she ended up with a stomach ache after eating less than half the sandwich. It came with the same leaves of lettuce and salt-encrusted fries my entree had. For dessert we shared a chocolate macaron ice cream, which was just OK. The only other addition to this lunch was one glass of wine. All in all the bill came to $108 plus tip for a terribly overpriced yet underwhelming lunch.

I would have liked it to be a bit more flavorful and the fries weren't to my liking so I passed on them. My friend ordered a ribs dish which looked much tastier, the meat just came off the bones with no effort but I couldn't speak for the flavor though.Overall it's a decent restaurant to visit, if you're in that area but there's no wow factor for me.

Happily, this place wasn't as crazy priced as I would have thought. Usually when you're in a major tourist spot, people like to crank up the prices to something insane. I found the drinks were very pricey, but everything else was pretty standard. I think my lunch at TGIFs in New York a couple of years back was more expensive and that was for chicken fingers or something. Anyway, back to the restaurant...We sat in the patio, which was gated off and had large umbrella's covering the tables and was nice for people watching. The waitress was very attentive, although we did have to ask twice for a gingerale for a kid who was joining us for lunch (because she wasn't feeling well...hence the gingerale). Our group ordered a variety of things off the lunch menu and everyone enjoyed their meal. I had their burger, which was ""fancy"" with some melted brie...yum! Came with their ""dirty chips"", which are basically seasoned potato chips, but very delicious. We ordered two desserts to share...one chocolate and one sorbet. While my chocolate dessert was good...the sorbet was AMAZING! And I'm not someone who would normally go for that type of thing...let me see if I can remember what it basically was...a fruit coulis, with coconut sorbet and meringue sticks on top...listen, all I know for sure was that I want to go back to New York NOW to have that dessert. I wasn't the only one in our party who felt that way. Apparently the menu was new. The day we were there was the first day they were doing it. Well done!!I would totally come back to this restaurant. Why the loss of one star?? Well as I said, I had no major qualms about the service by any means, but it wasn't perfect and the drink prices were very steep ($12 for a cocktail type deal).

3.0,8/25/2012,Just has a very nice late evening meal with my wife while visiting the city this weekend.  Food was good though overpriced. I have no problem paying for expensive meals as DC has really come into its own as far as first class dining is concerned. Twenty eight dollars for a pretty small Kobe beef burger engulfed by the bun was a bit much to stomach though. What was really irratating was that when I asked to substitute the fries for mashed potatoes (same price for both as an additional side on the menu) I was told that they do not substitute anything on the menu though I could purchase an additional side if I would like.Really? As I have been trying to stay away from fried foods I figured substituting two side items priced exactly alike would not be difficult.

It does help to show up with a lunch regular.  The ceviche and tuna tartare were so perfect.  We had a Bordeaux Blanc which was eh, but that wasn't there fault.  When they saw that I wasn't wild about it they offered to replace it with another bottle of my choosing, which they truly did not have to do.  Basically, I am writing this review because I was so impressed with the quality of service at a place that doesn't need to be that good at anything.  With their location in rock center, it doesn't really matter how bad/good their service and food are because people will just go there regardless.

The food was decent but full of butter and VERY Salty.  Beware, they don't make any substitutions and are quite rude when you ask. I said I had a food allergy and they were extremely unaccommodating.  One of my friends ordered the chicken and asked for it without the potatoes.  They would not substitute the potatoes for anything - not even more lettuce, so when her meal came, there was an empty spot where the potatoes should have gone.  The bill was over $500... You would think they could give her a few more pieces of lettuce or at least cover up the whole on her plate where the potatoes were supposed to be.  It was completely unprofessional and rude of the chef to do this. We were appalled.  The last straw is that someone left their phone at the table and when we called 10 minutes later to claim it, they said they didn't have it.  Clearly they had stolen the phone.  I DO NOT recommend this place.  They don't deserve your business after the way we were treated.  I'll add that we eat at all of the top restaurants in the city and know what we are talking about when it comes to service.",1,0,0,Phoebe F.,"Manhattan, NY",1,11,0

This year, I wanted to dine somewhere close to Rockefeller Center during the holidays and insisted we go back here. Boy, was I sorry. After numerous attempts at making a hamburger, they simply could not deliver. First it was overcooked. Then it was raw. While the manager did come out, apologize, and finally comp our check (we ate an appetizer and a ton of french fries!) he was also insistent that we let them make us new burgers. Well, after having been there over 90 minutes and eaten, bread, soup, and a lot of french fries we were not even hungry anymore. Nor was I willing to wait anymore. The easiest thing on the menu for the chef to make is probably the burger. Why getting it cooked medium was a problem is incomprehensible. Why it took so long to get a burger in the first place, only to get it practically burnt is another. Then waiting what seemed like forever to get a replacement that was literally raw was just too much.

2.0,12/27/2011,"Ugh.  Had actually looked into this place when considering braving the hordes of tourists for the Rockefeller Tree lighting (looking for a restaurant where you can see it but not be bombarded by crowds of tourists)....ended up foregoing the touristfest lighting, but came back right before Christmas to do our touristy once a year photo.  As I am generally ready to rip someones head off after just one block on 5th ave around the holidays where you cannot MOVE due to all the lost tourists, I needed a cocktail asap prior to tree photo.  Wandered in here having researched it for the lighting, but it looked kind of dumpy and depressing, so braved the tourists venturing to other venues, leaving when no seats or for other reasons, and eventually ended up back here even more frustrated than prior.Should have just waited for seats at the St. Regis bar, as it was much more festive, classy, and this place ended up being a huge mistake, just for cocktails (and apps which were forgotten).One obnoxious and trashy table in the bar area had confiscated all the chairs in the entire bar area, so the other 2 bar tables were chair-less, and having walked all over midtown, we wanted to sit.  Ended up sitting in some corner booth at the bar area, but the ambiance was very lacking.  Subway tiles, and it just seemed very dingy.  Also, the prices were the same as BG restaurant, which is obviously a gorgeous view and total tourist trap (aka you'd think $$$ vs. this dump).  I asked our waiter which he'd recommend between two cocktails, and if the bloody was any good.  He said it was, and that I know what bloodies taste like (well, actually some places have great bloodies while others are crap).  I decided to risk it as he claimed it was good, and a homemade mix.  Atrocious. Barely drinkable.  And same price as BG cocktails (~$16).  Boyfriend got a mojito of some sort which he said was disgustingly sweet, and they forgot his slider app (but did not make any mention of it, so after our drinks were gone and 30+ minutes had passed we just decided to close out and assume they weren't coming).  All in all, totally dumpy for something that could be a great tourist trap, or just nice respite from all the tree viewing tourists.  Has a view of the tree from most of the vicinity, so they really should improve their service and decor to justify their pricing.  Skip. Head up to Bergdorfs Restaurant, or the King Cole Bar at the St. Regis - both are much nicer and worth the pricing (well, maybe not worth the pricing, but at least more justifiable).",0,0,0,Danielle J.,"West Village, Manhattan, NY",213,572,10

4.0,8/31/2011,"Enjoyed a delicious and satisfying dinner at Brasserie Ruhlmann. I made a reservation with Savored which is a site that gives you 30% off your meal. They had the Restaurant Week menu available at the time and we weren't sure if they would allow us to use both deals, but they did! What a treat.The wine list was huge but they had very few options for single glasses. My sister and I ordered the only red we knew we'd enjoy and it was $14! So even though we had planned on saving money by using these deals, we ended up spending more with a $14 glass of wine. In it's defense it was a great glass though.Next: the menu. For the first course we each ordered the Shrimp & Avocado Salad with Grapefruit dressing. They brought it out on this gigantic bowl of ice to keep it cool and the presentation was great with the  food served in a scooped-out avocado half. Very yummy. At first it looked like a small serving but really was a lot and absolutely delicious.Second course: Grilled Skirt Steak with Jalapeno. We saw our dining neighbors enjoying this and had to have it. It was a very generous portion and they cut it into long thick strips so it was easier to enjoy. They cooked it perfectly and presentation again was beautiful. I've had plenty of delectable steaks in the city but for a skirt steak this is one of my favorites. Lastly I ordered the Brownie Hot Fudge Sundae. Need I say more? Absolutely delicious, though you can't really go wrong with a brownie sundae, right? My sister ordered the Floating Island, Vanilla Creme Anglaise at the waiters recommendation and did not enjoy it very much, though I found it very light and tasty. We finished this off with cappuccinos which were also made pretty well.Now - THE PROBLEMS. The service was extremely odd. At least 3 times they tried taking my sisters plate away before she was finished. I guess I am a faster eater but whenever I finished a course they took it as an opportunity to clear the whole table, even though she wasn't finished yet. We were here to enjoy our meal, not feel rushed while eating it. Especially since the restaurant was virtually EMPTY! At one point the waiter stood over her waiting for her to finish her last bite which was very awkward. A couple of times multiple waiters came over asking to remove a plate, when we said ""no we're not finished yet"" a different one came over a few minutes later! This was very distracting and rude, though I honestly thing it was a poor lack of communication from the staff that caused this. Our main waiter seemed to finally notice this at the end of our meal and said something about their service ""being like a ballet"", meaning what? They twirl around in circles trying to remove our plates? He said he'd hope we would experience it better next time, but it was ridiculous and not at all pleasing. Also was a bad joke in my opinion.Food was amazing and I would go back for that. Service made it lose its last star.

4.0,7/27/2011,"A classic French feel mixed with a New York bistro, this place a great spot for a date or business meeting.  The portions are small for the price, but you really do pay a premium for eating in Rockefeller center.  Definitely a hotspot for young business professionals, this restaurant is intimate, chic, and tasty.We came for restaurant week, and probably will go back for another meal every now and then.  I'd consider taking a date here for a special occasion, especially if you're sick of cooking for each other and would like to be waited on.  I couldn't give a full five stars only due to the serving process.  The wait staff rotates for each part of a meal, such a drinks and entrees, but having three or more servers just gets annoying when you've had a long day.  Also, the drinks were weak - we bought two lemongrass mojitos, and it definitely wasn't worth $32 together.  Charging per-glass on a soda? Kind of outrageous.  One of our appetizers wasn't what we asked for, but it still turned out well.So, in short, drink before you go and know that you'll spend a lot: but the food will most likely be good.",0,0,0,Alexander R.,"Manhattan, NY",56,50,0

Well, that said, not much to review here since they pissed us off as soon as we approached. Admittedly, we had no reservation for lunch but after a quick read of the reviews, etc., we popped over. No hello, no welcome, Just  ""Reservation?"" No, sorry, we don't but do you have a table for 3, inside? This snooty guy, without acknowledgement one way or another, walks to the door, we follow, go inside, where he tells another snooty guy about us, then leaves us to this total ass in a suit. He ignores us, seats three other parties, including one that came in after us with no reservations, then voila, he notices us again. And again, ""Reservations?"" No, but there is still 3 of us here willing to spend money in this establishment. So he literally turns around, and points to a table within a few feet of the front door and his work station. Menus set on the table, walks away. A woman approaches and we ask if we can take one of the many other empty tables that isn't in the path of the front door. She says there all reserved. All of them?

We shared the steak tartare and the raw bar platter for one for appetizers, had the maine lobster cobb salad and the Tuesday special - Bavette e I'Echalote for entrees and the apple tart and chocolate Profiteroles. The steak tartare was delicious. I'm usually never a fan of raw bar platters because I feel that they are grossly overpriced. This platter was ok but I feel that it's a little overpriced and the escargot is extremely difficult to eat. The cobb salad was excellent and had a good amount of lobster in it. The skirt steak was was served with potato gratin and caramelized onions that were delicious. The desserts were excellent, the apple tart was light and the chocolate profiteroles were like cream puffs filled with ice cream covered in hot chocolate syrup. The food was a little on the pricier side, but I believe the quality of food served was worth the price.When being seated they assume that you want to sit outside. A lot of business people go there to sit outside after work and unwind. Apparently it is the ""in thing"" to sit outside at this restaurant, but there is an inside, which is also very nice. The service from our waitress was pretty good despite having to wait for a while to initially be helped. The hostess seated us and we told her that we wanted to eat an early dinner. She said that we would have to wait the 20 minutes until they served dinner, so we said we'd wait. She seated us so that we could have drinks while we wait but gave us the lunch menu even though we made it clear that we wanted dinner. No one came to serve us for about 20 minutes besides the bartender who asked us for our drink orders.

1.0,6/10/2011,Probably best to leave this place to the tourist. We started with the selection of artisanal cheeses which was good. We also had the shrimp cocktail (also good). For dinner I had the roasted chicken which was very tough. The shoestring potatoes were so thinly sliced they did not even taste good. The dinner was crammed into a pot which made it very difficult to cut the chicken (once piece of chicken was under another one and the fries were piled high so they went all over when you tried to eat the chicken - really ridiculous way to serve a meal).

3.0,3/16/2011,"Went to this place with my family for my sister's birthday. By far the best feature of this restaurant is its location. You are IN Rockefeller Center and directly across the street from the ice skating rink. So it's is convenient to get to and is in a nice area.Everyone that worked there seemed to be friendly, although some of the servers seemed very skittish and were probably new. The food was really good overall, although the prices are really kind of absurd for what it is, even in NYC. But like I said, you're in Rockefeller so you should expect to pay a premium.I had the jumbo shrimp cocktail to start and they were pretty solid, and then I got the roasted chicken which was easily one of the best chicken dishes I've had. It was just perfectly cooked. Others at my table got the dover sole, NY strip steak, skirt steak and mussels and I heard no complaints.The only real hangup I had about this place is the service. It just isn't up to par for such an expensive restaurant. When we first sat down, I ordered a gin and tonic. Amongst the easiest drinks in the world to make. After about 15minutes, and a solid 10 minutes after everyone else had gotten their cocktails, I had to wave down our waiter and ask where my drink was. I figured he had just forgotten about it. He then says, oh, our tonic machine is broken, we're trying to fix it. Now, instead of having me wait forever and have to ask for my drink, just a common sense move on the waiter's part should have been to inform me it might be a long time. It ended up taking them 30 minutes to get me a gin and tonic. And I know what some of you may be thinking, they were probably busy. You would be incorrect, it was a Tuesday night and there were probably about 15 people in the restaurant, 5 of them at my table. Oh, and when I got my G&T, it sucked.Fortunately, since my drink sucked, I decided to switch to wine and their wine selection was very, very good.So, this place would easily be a 4 star because of its good food, great location and nice wine selection. What is holding it back are the sub-par service and noticeably overpriced menu. It was a cold night when I went, but I do imagine when it is nice outside, the outdoor seating would be awesome.",0,0,0,Ryan B.,"Philadelphia, PA",7,111,15

Seventy five percent of the time I order the chicken paillard and find it great every time. Thin but succulent chicken pounded flat covered with arugala and avocado it's amazing. They serve it over a mystery like hummus substance that spices it up with a garlic taste. The frites are the best in NY. The skirt steak is awesome, the croques amazing. It's overpriced but what the heck, location is key. If you like raw carrots get the carrot salad, fresh and satisfying.  And the tuna tartar tower is first rate.

4.0,1/20/2011,Time for another lunch review from a la Scott !Although located in a very touristy part of town the Brasserie Ruhlmann experience is a good one for locals and tourists alike.  The staff is welcoming and friendly and the service as brisk as you need especially if you are on a tight time frame as us rushed NY biz types tend to be!Special soup right now is a butternut squash soup.  Tasty and with just a touch of cream an outstanding choice.  A personal lunch favorite is the Lobster salad Cobb style.  Highly recommended as a generous salad and equally generous portion of chilled lobster all with a delightful sherry vinaigrette dressing (on the side). Price point is on the higher end but the food is quality and the deco decor of the restaurant most pleasant.  Given the feel good experience  and well prepared food i give lunch here 4 stars.  Till next time---A la Scott:),1,0,0,Scott S.,"Chicago, IL",39,67,0

2.0,10/6/2010,"My boyfriend and I stumbled upon this restaurant by chance while walking around 5th Avenue and the Rockefeller Center. It was a beautiful night, and the outside seating was simply picturesque. We made a reservation for 8:30 that night and came back later. The food was delicious. Incredible, even. My complaints, however, lie within the terrible service we received from both our waiter and the manager. We were sat and our server came over to get our drink orders. We checked out the wine list but ordered bottled flat water first. 15 minutes later, our server had not yet returned to get either drink or food orders. The manager came over and asked us if we had been seen yet, and then he took the drink orders. Our server came back another 15 minutes later for the food order. That would be the last time we saw him for another half hour. After our food came out, the server came over to check back on us in the middle of the meal and asked us if we wanted more bread. We did. We never got it, and that would be the last time we saw our server until he brought the $150 check. I watched my server walk past our table - repeatedly - without checking on us. He would ask the tables to our immediate left (who had also been complaining) if they needed anything, and ignored us. I have been working in the food service industry for over five years now, and this translates to unacceptable service. To be fair, our side of the restaurant was busy, but he was not the only server, and there were a plethora of food runners, bus boys, and other servers running around to assist him. When the $150 check came, I went inside to seek out the manager. As I was walking inside, I ran into the other server who had been waiting on us far more than my own, and asked him where the manager was. He asked me if it was a complaint about my server and I said it was. This server went on to tell me that the reason my server was so ""shitty"" was because he had ""gone to a party the night before, and come into work hungover, leaving him to be a shitty server all day."" I found the manager (who was young, French, sharply dressed with a buzz cut, and glasses) and told him I did not seek any sort of compensation or free meal, but that he should know that I saw my server a total of three times, and while the food was delicious, the service was sub par for a restaurant as expensive and nice as Brasserie Ruhlmann. I also explained that I am in the industry, and that while I work at a restaurant nowhere near as expensive or fancy as BR, this type of service would never be tolerated by my superiors. The manager then went on to explain away the awful service telling me that ""if I'm in the industry,"" I should simply ""understand"" when service is poor. Completely unacceptable. I went on to explain my dissatisfaction further, to which he replied, ""Oh, I'm listening to you."" I said, ""Are you just listening, or do you actually understand what I'm saying to you?"" He hesitated for thirty seconds and finally conceded and replied, ""I understand."" That night, I left $20 tip on a $150 check, and still felt awful about it, even though I knew the server didn't deserve what I had left. In retrospect, I wish I had simply given the other server who had been more attentive and honest the $20 and left a $5 tip for my actual server who, I believe, thinks he's entitled to a large tip solely because of the total on the check and not because of his good service (or in this case, lack thereof.) I don't know who taught the manager how to do his job, but he was, to be quite blunt, a jerk, with NO regard for customer satisfaction. Needless to say, the same goes for our server. If you're looking for a place with good service and where the ""customer is always right,"" do not look to Brasserie Ruhlmann as there are many other restaurants in Manhattan with vibrant, beautiful atmospheres, delicious food, and actual understanding that customers want to get what they pay for instead of leaving unsatisfied and bitter",3,0,0,Jessica A.,"Philadelphia, PA",249,94,7

Rockefeller Center is one of the few tourist-y places I really don't mind. I have walked by Brasserie Ruhlmann a million times and it's always crowded and people seem to be enjoying themselves. Laughing merrily and mostly empty plates is usually a good sign when choosing a dining destination. They have ample outdoor space, and there appeared to be two servers per table busting around the busy space. This is another good sign. Loads of servers means fast and attentive service. Mommy like. We decided to sit inside because Ted couldn't take the humidity any longer and craved A/C. I didn't care either way, but inside was completely empty and made for an intimate quiet meal. Lovely. They brought us drinks right away, and I devoured my Cosmo because it was just perfectly prepared. There was a thin layer of ice on the top and around the glass, making it wonderfully refreshing in the oppressive heat. We ordered quickly (had a show to catch!) and I couldn't wait for my Branzini Chilean Sea Bass with leek puree and roasted stuffed tomatoes. The Charcuterie appetizer we ordered was also a source of excitement. Lucky for us, everything was as we hoped, delicious! The Charcuterie included sopressata, prosciutto and duck pate with small crostinis among other cured meats. I could eat sopressata all day long so I was a happy camper and the duck pate was also really tasty and I ate it all right up. The sea bass was no disappointment, either. It was completely boned but still had the skin and was perfectly flaky and light. The staff was attentive the whole time throughout our meal, without being invasive of our conversation or privacy as diners. The bill also came quickly and we paid and walked west to Radio City. I was pretty surprised with the level of service and amount of care and skill put into the food. You expect a place that caters to tourists to be only mediocre, at best, and overpriced (which this sort of was) and be packed and gaudy (the inside was a mix of art deco and classic french bistro - fun!).

Didn't mind too much because it was nice outside and we weren't that hungry. When we sat we were smack dab in the sunshine when there were plenty of tables more in the shade, the hostess girls in the front couldn't be bothered to look around to determine a better seat it seemed but then again it was very sunny outside. Our waiter was really nice and helpful, we didn't get bread until after we got our appetizers and that was only because we saw other tables getting it. We had to ask about three times and then we were given a sweet breads basket and watched as the confused busboy took a basket to one table then took another one off their table and brought it to us and then took it away. When we finally did get it is was nice and warm. Our food was very good. My mom had the goose and duck pate and thought it was amazing (I don't eat that stuff).  My dad loved his french onion soup. They both got the monkfish special and enjoyed it and I had the grilled chicken paillard which was very good but very oily.

Don't judge - NYC Restaurant Week is the only way I can get any of my NY friends to shell out for a semi-nice place!The service was all right, if a bit slow. They were attentive, but it did take a while for the dishes to each come out. I started with the goat cheese risotto with fresh water shrimps (carb zombie alert!). The risotto was cooked perfectly and only accented by the shrimp. Definitely recommend this out of the three RW starter choices. For my entree, I chose the braised curry short ribs indian style served over a bed of rice. The ribs were fall-apart goodness. Flavorful without being over seasoned. Dessert was the crepe soufle with meyer lemon suzette - it was what I expected it to be. Light and fluffy, while the meyer lemon was a very refreshing addition to each bite.We brought 2 bottles of red. Over the phone, they had told me that corkage fee was $15, but we were charged $20.

With two glasses of wine, and great service, it's almost enough to overlook the tourists sitting next to us and outlining their next day's itinerary. In French.",0,0,0,Sasha C.,"Chelsea, NY",12,94,0
5.0,2/14/2009,"Love at first bite!Came here on Valentines Day.  I wasn't expecting much given this place is located in tourist central.  I quickly changed my mind after a bite of the mushroom soup with truffle oil and cheese from my date, and had to order one on my own.  The short rib was very melt-in-your-mouth tender, and the dessert... both penna cotta and the dark chocolate cake, was beautifully presented and amazing tasting.  3 courses on Valentine's day for $35... you really can't beat the deal!And although I didn't expect service given the holiday, I was very pleasantly surpised here.  Our waitress was wonderful and very attentive.  And the maitre'de checked up on us at every course of the meal.Definitely coming back to try more dishes, and more dessert!",0,0,0,Annie H.,"New York, NY",216,606,1799
5.0,1/23/2009,"Ok here is the deal on the real. This place is very pricey for what it is. HOWEVER, the food is outstanding. The freshest ingredients are used. The meats are so tender and the vegetables are so crisp. I had the KOBE Burger last time I was there. THE BEST BURGER I HAVE EVER HAD IN MY LIFE. It did not feel greasy. Just a prefect balance of seasoning and a well crafted burger.",0,1,1,Mike D.,"Estero, FL",54,221,56

4.0,8/21/2008,"Sometimes a great patio, perfect weather, and great service can make up for what a restaurant lacks in food.  I give this place 1 full extra star for all those little extras.   Though I have to say, the white bean soup (sorry, it was a special), was absolutely fantabulous!  Don't you love it when soup is poured into the bowl for you by your server, at your table - sometimes it's the little things. Other foods - very good bass, excellent thin crust apple tort.  It was unusual that the apple tort was served with a green apple sorbet.  The chef refuses to make any substitutions to the menu.  I'm not a sorbet girl, but apparently there was no way to get vanilla ice cream instead :(  The sorbet was ok ... if you're into that kind of thing.",1,0,0,Jen L.,"New York, NY",16,190,0
3.0,8/20/2008,Good but how do I justify spending $16 on a ham and cheese sandwich? I know it has a fancy french name( croque monsieur) and Ruhlman is good buddies with my hero Anthony Bourdain. But damn. My friend's lobster bisque was pure bliss. Beautiful dining room and great service and close to the Rock.,4,0,1,Sophia C.,"San Francisco, CA",129,319,52
3.0,5/19/2008,not bad not bad - worth the wait - not so much - the burger i had was good - the artichoke appetizer was way better. absent minded staff was a bit of a turn off. nice to sit outside and watch the action and buzz around rockefeller plaza - just a bit expensive for a casual lunch. go here if you are on expense account.,1,0,1,Jonathan W.,"New York, NY",72,184,5
3.0,3/17/2008,"Brasserie Ruhlmann is alright. Used to be kick-ass, now just alright.I have eaten here far too many times, definitely over 100. It was just too damn convenient considering I used to live one block away.Food is almost always good. Really nice to eat outside when its warm. Unfortunately, the quality of service, speed, and overall competency of staff has been on the slide for many months. They used to have the most awesome maitre d but shipped him off to Chicago. Additionally, they have done away with all the fun little extra things that used to make this place special.Interestingly enough, prices have soared while quality has plummeted.If you go to Brasserie Ruhlmann, you can expect at least a fair dining experience. It's never downright bad. It just isn't what it used to be.",3,0,0,Alex S.,"New York, NY",11,60,3
3.0,1/31/2008,"Had dinner here for restaurant week.  The service was slow and bread didnt come to the table for at least 15-20 min.  You gotta try the mini kobe beef burgers.  They come 3 to an order and they have different toppings on each.  Nice and juicy and flavorful.  Mushroom soup was nice and creamy, but too heavy - might try the salads as they looked fresh and vibrant.  The chicken fricassee was a bit on the vinegary side and overcooked.  The steaks were a little rare (from what my companions stated - but good if you like that stuff).  For desert, the chocolate mouse with almond cookie was delicious.  Light and airy.  I would like to come back to try the other dishes because it was all just average to me, but my friends loved their dishes.  Location is awesome - right in the center of Rockefeller Plaza.",0,0,0,Peter G.,"Forest Hills, NY",111,34,26
3.0,11/6/2007,"perfect for a new york business lunch.  i had their salad (because i couldn't understand my waiter) and some amazing bread.  the burger looked amazing.  i couldn't sample the wine, but it may have made the menu a little less intimidating :)",1,0,1,hilary w.,"San Francisco, CA",225,59,0
4.0,7/30/2007,I went over there during the Restaurant week and I enjoyed their special menu.  I like the kobe burger and their dessert.   The food is light but tasty.  It is an average french restaurant and the location is just at the ROCK.  The best place to take a girl there for a simple dinner.,1,0,1,Ken C.,"New York, NY",48,721,2
