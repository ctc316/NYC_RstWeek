5.0,4/14/2019,Amazingly beautiful restaurant and nice setup. There's a place in the back that's outdoorsy without being exposed to the elements; as perfect as one could ask for. BRUNCH TIL 4!!!

The eggs were runny at the top, solid at the bottom, and appeared to have been dropped on the plate from a distance. When I asked for them to be recooked the waiter pulled out his notepad and tried to tell me I had made a mistake when I ordered. None of the meal was comped and they didn't make any attempt to rectify the problem.

2.0,2/18/2019,"This review is just for the food. Service was great, very nice and accommodating hosts/waiters. (Would give 4-5 stars based on that alone)Brasserie Seoul based on the better views, sets higher than normal expectations for hotel restaurants but doesn't meet them. The food isn't inedible, it just isn't what you would expect. Having made these dishes myself before and watching pro chefs online prepare them, this is my best guess at how Brasserie Seoul put the following dishes together:Korean fried chicken wings- mostly likely reheated frozen wings (soggy skin).Truffle mac n cheese- most likely instant mac, no flavor and just a bit of watery cheese. Steak au poivre- no peppercorns (queue Sterling Archer).Hudson valley duck- duck breast was cooked well but no seasoning.I'd skip eating here altogether since you can probably go down the block and pick up a pastrami egg and cheese that won't disappoint lolSide note: Yelp page reports the venue dress code attire as 'dressy', it's not",3,0,1,Jimmy L.,"Brooklyn, NY",558,86,12

The soup came out cold, things where missing on my plate that was on the menu and the ""jumbo shrimp"" cocktail was so small.

2.0,10/1/2018,"Where should I start......Upon arriving there was no one at the hosts desk, we practically had to seat ourselves. Once we finally got someones attention we had to use the bathroom. Bathrooms are locked because it is attached to the hotel, we had to ask for the bathroom key, TWICE.The appetizers were ordered, and they never came back to get our entree order. Once we were half done with our appetizers they took down or entree order. The appetizers were okay, I did enjoy the Portuguese octopus but the artichoke flatbread and burrata taste like something that came from a jar. The beef tartare was okay. Once our entree orders were in, we waited for a good 20min to get our food. Once arrived, one of the orders were wrong, so we had to wait for that to get cooked. I got the long neck clams in linguini, it was WAYYYY too salty. We also go the steak which was cooked to our specifications but didn't have a great taste. The burger was also okay. Overall the experience was not great, I feel bad because the name of the place gives off an interesting name of Korean fusion. Nothing about the food was Korean, and barely French. Seemed more Italian to me. The waiter did try to justify the experience by giving complimentary drinks etc but the restaurant just isn't as good as it used to be. I hope they improve the staff as well as the quality of food.",5,1,2,Julio G.,"Newark, NJ",251,380,1514
2.0,9/28/2018,"The first time I dined here about six month ago, the name of the restaurant was Brasserie Séoul, and the cuisine was clearly defined as French-Korean Fusion. The dishes were unique and satisfying, the waiters were incredibly friendly, and the restaurant was fully deserving of a four star review. I came back last week and saw that ""Séoul"" has been dropped on the menus, although not on Yelp or even on their website, so judging by the new name alone, I'm guessing the cuisine is now simply French? Things I saw on the menu: 3 different Italian pastas, Italian crudo, burrata flatbread (that would be Italian again), Portuguese octopus, Mediterranean hummus/olive/feta appetizer, just to name a few. Things I did not see on the menu: a single French dish, unless you want to count the fact that French fries go by Frites here. Confused? Yeah, me too.So here's where things get even more complicated: I came back here for the weekly Monday CUBAN night and the extended happy hour because my boyfriend's parents were staying at the Holiday Inn right above Brasserie. Our waiter got instantly defensive when we asked about the happy hour, rudely stating that happy hour only goes until 7PM daily, and that the only Monday special is the discounted mojito. He then rushed off to loudly complain about our question to the bartender. Exact words on the Monday menu ""Live Cuban music. Happy hour 6PM to 9PM. ALL NIGHT $7 Cuban Mojito."" To clarify further, the restaurant is open until 11 PM and has a long separate Happy Hour menu. How would you interpret that ""special""? We made the mistake of staying even after all this because we were exhausted, but I wish we had found better plans for the night once we knew the whole Cuban night and happy hour was a fluke. Oh, and there was no band or live music anywhere in sight. No es bueno.The $1 oysters we managed to order right before 7 PM would be something positive to point out, but our waiter went to complain about us yet again to the bartender when we asked for crackers or a side of bread to have with the oysters, then awkwardly came back empty-handed having forgotten to actual bring the crackers or bread and had to be reminded. Also, the oysters came with a side of salsa. ¿Que? The salmon entree was overshadowed by the simple side of polenta it came with, although not one person out of our group of four could taste the truffle oil that was advertised for this dish. The artichoke flatbread was luckily only big enough for one bite for a each of us because it tasted like bland cardboard.Brasserie is in need of some serious help with its identity crisis, unprofessional waiting staff, and the disorganized, uninspired dishes the chef pushes out. It's sad to see a new hot spot that seemed so full of potential just a short six months ago has fully turned into nothing more than a standard, overpriced, empty, Séoul-less hotel restaurant.

3.0,9/16/2018,"We had breakfast here. You can order a la carte or have the buffet.

4.0,9/8/2018,"What brought me here is that I always used to go to bistro Petit and then Chef Park came here. I loved that they had a book on oysters. I got the prime burger, medium rare as per usual, and my friend ordered one the Cavatelli Both were great. The fries accompanying the burger were crispy on the outside, soft on the inside, thick and well seasoned. The cocktail I got - the expat punch was great as well, reminded me of a whiskey sour. I chose it for the toasted barley tea and the toasted barley flavor didn't really present itself but it was still a solid choice.  Then for dessert we split some sort of fruit mousse, I believe it was either mango or passion fruit with strawberry. The interior is very white, with pop music playing in the background. Neither too casual not too buttoned up. I would definitely visit again",2,1,1,Celia N.,"Brooklyn, NY",46,178,655
2.0,9/3/2018,"Finally had a chance to check out Brasserie Seoul this weekend. I'd been going to Chef Sung Park's intimate restaurant Bistro Petite for the past 4 years... every Birthday, Valentine's Day, random Friday night craving with my boyfriend was spent dining with Chef Park, so I was excited to see his larger scale restaurant near Barclays. When we arrived there we were sad to find out that Chef Park was not involved in the restaurant AND that the menu was in fact no longer Korean-French fusion. It was more American fare with so suggestions of Korean (i.e. fried chicken with daikon radish...). Disappointing, however, we wanted to give it a shot since we'd trekked over from Manhattan, so we stayed to try the brunch options. What do I think of the current Brasserie Seoul without Chef Park?It's a good thing that they're changing the name, the current name as it stands is misleading. - Steak and Fries brunch -- if I wasn't starving I think I wouldn't have eaten this. For $23 I was expecting my meat to actually be medium and not chewy. The fries were okay as was the salad, but I've had better at places like Friedman's (which you should definitely go to if you haven't tried it already)- Beet Salad -- again, if I wasn't starving.... what's with the creme fraiche base? I don't understand this addition to a salad, its unnecessary. Also the whole idea of a beet salad is that it's heavy on the beets not the arugula. - Chocolate Cake -- this was a nice gesture to us from the kitchen and current Chef. We did really appreciate this as it was a birthday brunch.  My final thoughts, I did like how bright and clean looking the restaurant was. The natural light was nice especially during a brunch. This place is like any 3star hotel dining option. Not worth the trip, but if you're staying at the Holiday Inn or in the area and just in the mood to have a couple drinks, not the worst option.",2,0,0,Devonne C.,"Manhattan, NY",347,42,131
2.0,9/1/2018,"Not what we had hoped. We're big fans of chef Sung Park and used to frequent his restaurant Bistro Petit until he closed it to relaunch Brasserie Seoul. Unfortunately the menu was completely different than what we had read about online and it now appears as a mess of random things: ""Mediterranean platter"" ""Polish cod"" ""bistro burger"" ""steak and quinoa"" ""chicken wings"" ""sushi"". What's the theme here? Where's the French Korean influence? No ""farro mushroom risotto"", no ""oysters and pork belly"", no cassoulets, boeuf bourguignon or duck that we'd seen advertised. Very disappointing!!We tried the fried chicken wings which were soggy, tasteless and most likely microwaved. The truffle mac and cheese was fine. The 10oz steak was very plain, lacking any sear, flavoring or sauce...it was just a slab of unseasoned meat. Salmon was ok but also lacking, though nicely plated. The ""passion finger"" dessert was good. We tried several different cocktails and found them disappointing and overly sugary, filled with neon juice and syrup. At least the waiter was attentive and the restaurant itself is clean and sleekly designed (though hardly ""intimate"" as listed on here).Besides the misconceptions about the menu, we'd also hoped for a bit more of a spiffy atmosphere because Yelp lists Brasserie Seoul as ""dressy"" and ""upscale"". Turns out this space is connected to the lobby of Holiday Inn with diners in t-shirts and sandals, on their computers, dirty ripped menus, pop music, etc. which...whatever, I'm fine with casual dining, but we once again found ourselves feeling mislead.

As a vegetarian, the options were somewhat limited and definitely not good enough to merit a second trip. Specifically, the tteock was a bit bland and, for the love of god, a mushroom risotto is the best vegetarian option a kitchen this creative can come up? It's neither French nor Korean nor interesting. The ""chick pea cracker"" in the heirloom tomato was literally an Indian pappadum not credited as such (and attempted to be dressed up as something fancier). That dish was good but didn't belong and masqueraded too fancy. Frankly, the fries/ketchup were probably the culinary highlight for me!Also, this place was just radically too expensive in my view.

2.0,5/12/2018,"Giving it two stars because one of the two dishes was good- very close to only one star.Came here for brunch- only two other tables were occupied.   Sat down and waited at least ten minutes until anyone came over; there was no water at the table but there were water glasses and wine glasses.   A lot of people were working there but never really felt like we had a server.   Ordered a bloody mary and bellini- the lady that took our order than went behind bar to make drinks, she also filled our water glasses.   Another guy brought our drinks over and took our order.   And then we waited and waited and waited.   It took a good 45 minutes for food to come out.  Not once did anyone come over and ask if we needed anything ie. water glasses were empty for a bit, and brunch drinks also got light.   When food eventually came out- they did not bring my friends entree and put the fries in front of her.  We stated she also ordered something- no acknowledgement whatsoever to whether they knew that or apology or anything.   I got the bread pudding bacon and eggs which was very good!  5 minutes later they eventually brought my friends dish which was the benedict.  One of the eggs didn't even look like an egg... Again no one once asked how anything was, could they get us anything.   When they were trying to clear our plates  one of the waiters asked if I wanted another bloody mary which I might have had it been thirty minutes earlier...   Pretty mediocre experience driven mainly by the awful service.",1,0,0,Molly G.,"New York, NY",12,45,0

We started off with some delicious cocktails one called Seoul Mate which used a korean yogurt and Sun also Rises that tasted like a refreshing margarita . We had the steak tartare and Truffle Tteock for appetizers and shared the Wagyu Steak that was one of the best cuts we've ever had ! Definitely worth stopping by can't wait to come back .,2,0,1,Jay P.,"Queens, NY",0,10,17
5.0,4/19/2018,"Went here last Thursday night! Made a RSVP and was taken to my seat quickly! Had the margarita cocktail which was great and served with crushed ice which I loved! Not overly sweet at all!We ordered the tomato and buratta salad- was yummy and fresh, amazing way to start a dinner! Then we tasted the mushrooms- so much flavor! Dip the toast in the sauce! ;) also tried the truffle tduck and cheese- which was my favorite of everything- very comforting, lots of cheese, truffle with a slight chili kick! Then we had the fish which was very special and the sauce which we have to have again! Everything was exceptional and we are definitely planing on trying the brunch here too!! Service was good! They kept our table cleared and packed some leftover for us too! So happy for places like this in Brooklyn!",1,0,0,Neti B.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,14,4
3.0,4/18/2018,"Came here on a Tuesday evening.  Maybe a total of 10 other diners at 4 tables were in the restaurant.  It seems like they are still sorting through training and development issues as the servers and line cooks seemed inexperienced.  Overall, the food was quite delicious (4 stars) but minus one star for speed of service.  We ordered the Oysters and Pork Belly (OK if eaten separately, but not together as it's plated), Roasted Bone Marrow (delicious), Steak Tartare (pretty good, basically a fancier version of Yookwe), Kimchi Bouillabaisse (very good with great depth of flavor and lots of seafood) and Duck (very good as well).  However, the timing of the food was very slow despite the restaurant being quite empty.  It's an open kitchen so you can see Chef Park training his line cooks during dinner service, even showing one of them how to shuck oysters.  Appetizers took about 20 minutes to come out despite 2 of the 3 being raw preparations and our main courses took another 45 minutes (seemed like Chef Park was cooking the Duck dish himself).  We were at dinner for almost 2 hours.  Would definitely go back for the food but only if the speed of service improves.",0,1,0,Kevin V.,"Manhattan, NY",116,8,0
3.0,4/15/2018,"Mixed feelings.Some dishes were good, but some weren't.When we went on Saturday night, it was semi crowded and was taken to our seats. But it took awhile to get our DRINKS. Seoul mate was actually tasty.Foods.Oysters and Pork Belly: they might be good individually but the flavor was not wonderful. It wasn't horrible but not worth trying. Disappointing. Wagyu Tartar was good except too much Wasabi oil. Fried Anchovies: they need to work on their sause. I hear they recently opened so might give them another chance after they make improvements (ghats me being nice). Foods were 2 stars, and 1 star just because the staff was trying their best. But except to wait long time for every order.",2,0,0,Ayumi N.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",1,36,75
5.0,4/14/2018,"I'm a Manhattanite but decided to make the trek to Brooklyn to try Brasserie Séoul and it was WELL worth it!! 100% recommend the seafood pancake as a appetizer as it is a classic dish that includes all the best Korean flavors. The atmosphere was so unique- with a comfy yet warm layout and staff that was VERY attentive. I highly recommend this spot for a date night!! For an entree, I had the crusted cod fish and it was delicate, yet savory and paired well with the chef-suggested Soul Mate drink. This drink was surprisingly pleasant as it combined a classic Korean yogurt flavor with a slight hint of alcohol!!",1,0,0,Amanda H.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,1,0
1.0,4/7/2018,"I would give it 0 stars if I could. Supposedly this place was too busy that it took 30 minutes to get drinks but there was like 3 full tables and rest were leaving. 30 minutes later they bring out a small plate with a slice of old crusty bread with fig on top, tasted horrible and not sure if that was supposed to hold us over until our entrées arrived 2 hours later. You would expect at this point they had gone out and fished seafood and the food would be out of this world. Yea, not quite the Tuna thingy with foam, not sure what that was, but passed around table and no one could eat it. The seafood stew thing was overcooked like it literally sat on stove while we waited for 2 hours. They brought some sad looking Brussel sprouts, that looked like someone else's leftovers as consolation, but it was so burnt and cold was inedible. I get they are new but then shouldn't you be listening to your customers to improve? What's even more infuriating is chef is chatting away behind us with his buddies and could care less about food or his customers! Really!? Good luck lasting in NYC, better off ordering room service from Holiday Inn next door. At least you won't have to wait 2 hours for food and probably tastes better too!",1,0,0,Suki N.,"Rockville, MD",3,91,42
1.0,4/7/2018,"Worst experience for our group. The place was not busy this Saturday but it took half an hour to get our drinks, another half hour for the appetizers and an hour for the main course. The food was overcooked and the chef who was on the phone most of the time did not want to address our concerns. He talked endlessly to some people at a table behind us. He did not care. The server was okay. The only thing that came out okay was the duck leg, the rest of the food we ordered was bad: the cod, tuna and a mix of mussels dish. If this place is to last, they need to respect their food and their customers.",5,0,0,Ishmael N.,"Rockville, MD",2,7,15

3.0,4/3/2018,"I'd say this place was a little overhyped. Everything is good but nothing really stood out either. I got the fricassée de champignons for an appetizer cause I got lured in by the truffle oil but I'd recommend getting some of their other appetizers, I made the wrong choice. I quite enjoyed the prawn pasta. Gochujang worked well with the tomato sauce without overpowering the tomato taste. Risotto (more mushrooms for me) was nice, def recommend for the vegetarians out there. The cassoulet was my least favorite. Very heavy, got a little too oily in the end for my taste, couldn't really taste the kimchi mixed together and there were a LOT of beans. It also took a while for the food to come out. You'd definitely get a satisfying meal here but I wouldn't go out of the way just to eat here.",3,0,0,Songnia X.,"New York, NY",316,17,18
5.0,3/30/2018,"After dining at Bistro Petit, I knew I had to try out Chef Parks newest venture at Downtown Brooklyn when I learned about it in on NYT! Client lunch, shared appetizers and desserts. The restaurant was bright and cozy. The Chef came by and explained the inspiration and key ingredients of the dishes, giving personal suggestions on which main we should go with. We started with a simple field green salad with wild flowers, heirloom tomato salad, truffle tteock & cheese and fricassee de champignons. All was delicious and easy to shared! The truffle tteock & cheese was the crowd pleaser, assembling a decadent Mac & Cheese but with the Korean rice cake. So delicate but satisfying! I went with the Beef Bourguignon and I know it is good because I had a version of it at Park's Bistro Petit. It is presented differently this time with a lid which is a subtle nod to its Korean inspiration galbi jjim. The short rib is so tender and every component of the dish balances with earthiness, saltiness and sweetness. The meal ended with a tart Blueberry Soup and Beignet with ice cream. My clients were impressed and I again was wow'ed by Chef Park's creation!",8,1,3,Nancy N.,"New York, NY",358,165,409
5.0,3/30/2018,Excellent experience. The vibe is nice and the food is truly delicious. We had Truffle Tteock & cheese that exceeded our expectations. Both entrees Tuna and Cod were delightful and intricate. The wine is list is great. We tried Noble Tree Cab and Cote Rhone as well as as Vino di Visciole for dessert.,1,0,0,Maya D.,"Brooklyn, NY",117,13,11
5.0,3/24/2018,"We decided to try this restaurant after reading tasting table and NYtimes articles, and we really loved it! I think it's more French styled with an undertone of Korean influence but loved the flavors overall. It was a soft opening so they treated us to a complimentary champagne in the beginning, which was a cherry on top. Our favorite was the oysters with pork belly and kimchi, and truffle ttuokboggi (genius how he thought of this!!!) as well as bone marrow/tomatoes. We had duck cofit for entree, which was great but thought it could use more flavor. Each dish had such a great mix of flavor and I'm so glad we have a restaurant like this in the neighborhood. We also had the blueberry compote and passion fruit ice cream for dessert and they also recommended a really good dessert wine to go with it. Being Korean myself, I loved how he creatively used Korean flavors for French dishes. At the end, the chef came by and even chatted with us which made the whole experience so personal! We love this restaurant and will def be returning for brunch or another dinner. There's ""soul"" to the flavors of his food and you can feel that the chef cares about every dish and is passionate about what he does. Five stars for impeccable service and delicious food!! Def recommend !!!",2,0,0,Deborah M.,"Brooklyn, NY",291,10,28
