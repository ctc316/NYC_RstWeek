1.0,4/26/2019,"Gave this one star because there is no spot for ZERO starsWe just walked out of the restaurant without ordering because of the attitude of the Waiter and the management. Despite having a reservation, although we were seated immediately, no waiter came for more than 15 minutes. When the waiter finally came and I told him that were waiting for a long time, his response was, ""don't raise your voice"". We walked out and told the management what had happened, all we got were blank stares. Not going back there again. We ran into an Indian couple who had just eaten there - they were told that could not get a reservation - they went there anyway and there were more than 10 empty tables.

5.0,4/1/2019,"Such a great experience! I went there with a group of my friends and we had the best time. The atmosphere is upscale casual but the menu items are refined. The som guided us towards a lovely bottle that suited all our taste, thankfully, as their wine list is literally the size of a King James Bible! We all got very different entrees, each one delicious. The crispy salmon and steak poivre were my favorites but the rhubarb slaw they serve with the duck is to die for. The creme brulee for dessert is the must have with bread pudding as a close second.

4.0,2/10/2019,"It's not often we get a do-over in life, love or on the job.So, when, to my surprise, I was emailed about my disastrous experience there during Restaurant Week by the GM and invited back gratis. Full disclosure: I have been a restaurant reviewer during my travels, and I am very picky when it comes to quality and very candid when dining experiences are unpleasant.So, my expectations were understandably low when my husband and I returned. Frankly, everything we ordered was stellar. No complaints with the food whatsoever. We ordered the Butternut Tortelloni and Mediterranean Octopus for appetizers and my husband, an aficionado of the intelligent creature, said it was up there with a Greek restaurant we frequent. Little Green Oak Leaf salad should be re-named BIG green oak salad. We steered clear of the cauliflower this time and had the asparagus which was firm and sweet. The Moroccan Spiced Salmon was lovely, cooked medium-rare as requested. The Sole Milanese, lightly breaded and fried was light and tasty. Not greasy at all. Chocolate Mousse was ridiculously rich and delicious as was the Steamed Lemon Custard.

5.0,1/20/2019,"Went here for brunch... never go to the UWS but was meeting a friend. Super excited to see that this restaurant was part of the restaurant group that includes Marseille and Cafe D'Alsace, as those are some of my go to restaurants.Food was just as good... ambiance is more casual and saw friends as well as families enjoying the place. Had the tuna tartar and a glass of red wine. Both great. My friend got the Eggs Benedict, and loved it along with the breadbasket.If I had to give any critic, I would say make it more obvious on the menu the GF items, I see it on the website but on the menu would be helpful. Also the hostesses sat me at a table that I clearly could not fit at as I am a curvy girl, and I had to get up and ask to be moved. They were very sweet and accommodating, but it was an uncomfortable situation for all and really no reason as the restaurant was not full at all. Regardless I loved it and if I find myself on the Upper West Side again, I would go back for sure.",0,0,0,Luciana R.,"Manhattan, NY",3,121,14

The mushroom risotto appetizer was creamy and very filling. The salmon was delicious, but a very small piece of fish. The hanger steak was flavorful, but chewy. The wine list is amazing. The osso Buco was delicious but a small piece of meat. I have never seen such an extensive wine list. We left very full and thoroughly enjoyed our dinner. The service was excellent and our waitress was knowledgeable and attentive. The atmosphere is upbeat and very NYC.

4.0,12/23/2018,"I was invited to brunch at Nice Matin so I read through the Yelp reviews in advance. Ironically, many said that service was at best lackluster, but thanks to Ashley G, our service was friendly, attentive, efficient and the highlight of our dining experience!The restaurant is nicely laid out and the food choices for brunch were plentiful. I had heard and read that Nice Matin was known for great burgers, so I and one of my dining partners went for that. The other member of our party had Cob salad with shrimp.My hamburger was ordered medium rare on the rare side and came out cooked exactly as ordered. The meat was flavorful, the quantity generous but for au poivre, it was a bit bland until I added more pepper. The bun was lightly toasted and complimented the meat quite well. The burger comes with fries but I was a good boy and asked for a side of salad instead. Now in theory that was a good thing, but I tried a fry one of my dining partners had received and before I caught myself, I had ""sampled"" over half of hers!I should also mention that the bread basket included some excellent mini bran muffins, and Ashely G made sure we had full water and coffee cups at all times.  So overall a great dining experience!",6,3,5,Neil B.,"Brooklyn, NY",593,1013,1261
1.0,12/18/2018,"My wife and I have been to this restaurant three times as we like to stay in the Hotel Lucerne (next door) which is close to our son in Manhattan.  In fairness, my wife had a better impression of the restaurant than I did, but I think pretentious is an understatement.  As others have mentioned it is expensive and there are a lot of upcharges.  For example, my wife did not want meat in her omelet and substituted spinach- that was an upcharge.  The waiter was polite, but hungover or otherwise distracted.This restaurant is really not worth the price and, I think we all agree, an omelet is not difficult.  Unless you put all the ingredients in 30% of the omelet.  The point of an omelet is to meld the ingredients in the egg- it is not that difficult, but apparently it can be.And, even if an omelet is a stretch, certainly you can do toast.  No, at the Nice Matin, toast is simply bread on a plate.  How about coffee?  All you have to do is open the Folgers and pour the coffee.  No that will require multiple requests to get what was clearly Folgers coffee.So, great name which is very inviting, but poor execution over several visits and now even my wife agrees that Denny's may be better.",0,0,0,William M.,"Atlanta, GA",7,72,5

2.0,12/2/2018,"Stopped here for a late evening dinner with a dear friend. We both ordered the same entree grilled prime hanger steak. I was not able to cut or chew mine. It was like chewing gum. I has to sneak what I attempted to chew back on to my fork and to the corner of the plate. The fries were way too salty, so much so that it had a sting to it. My friend said her steak was okay and it did appear to be a better cut. I hope I don't have another dinner like this before the year is out. Considering it's December it will not be too difficult.

3.0,11/5/2018,"This review is based on two experienced:Dinner in 2016- 4,5 stars as they'd say en France.Brunch yesterday ( 11/2018) 2 stars.My boyfriend and I ordered  the fresh fruit bowl ($11) and the steak frites ($27). He also had the fresh squeezed OJ.The service ( a mostly non existent waiter named Joshua) was absent and sloppy. They brought our fruit bowl out first......and then another 20 minutes later (which we sent back as the first was mostly underripe cantaloupe and overripe strawberries). Another 15 minutes pass and they bring the steak frites.... with no steak knife.Mind you we had now been at the restaurant for well over an hour and had only seen our waiter once.The steak was very well flavored.. but over cooked. Definitely not ""medium"" as requested.I don't want to just base Nice Matin on this one experience- it was the Saturday of the Marathon and we sat outside.

4.0,9/20/2018,"Went there for a birthday dinner because they have one of the greatest wine lists in the city and they have a very reasonable corkage fee of $45. (They have thousands of bottles on the list including an 1864 Mouton Rothschild!) and a number of special older vintages. The staff decanted my special bottle of Bordeaux and I also picked out a lovely half bottle of champagne. (They have a nice selection of half bottles there which is very rare to find. )I ordered the tuna tartare and the steak frites. Everything was delicious. The steak was perfectly cooked and very tasty and the fries were thin and crunchy and perfect. Wife ordered the burger which was outstanding. Daughter had the escargots and the ravioli which she enjoyed. The service was really lovely and professional. In all, it was a perfect place to celebrate.

2.0,8/22/2018,"I was at this restaurant on a quiet Sunday night (2018 Aug 19)... I went to enjoy a nice dinner by myself with a book to unwind from a busy day.However, when I got there first of all the hostess never came back to seat me, I wasn't given a menu when the maître d'/manager seated me, it took at least 10 minutes for anyone to acknowledge me when I was at the table, they serve me risotto without a spoon and I had to ask twice for a spoon, the runners were great about bringing my food out in a timely manner...however, none of the servers came by in the way that they are supposed to and did not acknowledge me trying to get their attention multiple times.My order was not even taken by my server. The maįtre d or manager was the one who noticed that I was trying to get my service attention and came and had to take my order himself. There were only four other tables in this large restaurant that had customers. And no one was at the bar. The table next to me and the one across from me we're getting great top-notch service. The pessimistic side of me keeps wondering if this was a racist situation because I was the only person of color there. But, I never want to make that assumption... But as the night came to a close the thought did pop into my mind.So, I don't understand what happened that night... Especially considering that I made a very large order because I was taking food home for my boyfriend. I spent almost $200 and that's how they treated me? Like I said, the runners were great and the maître d or manager stepped up once he realized I wasn't being served in the manner that would be expected in such an establishment. It was incredibly frustrating especially since I just want to go have a nice dinner to relax. it wasn't even like I was there in pajamas or something... I was wearing a pretty summer dress and my hair was done nicely with a touch of makeup on my face...I've never in my life had had an experience like this of an establishment of this caliber. The two stars are for the maître d or manager and for the runners and because the food was worth three and a half Stars taste-wise and for presentation. Just the main basic services of a Hostess and the servers was so appalling that I have to give them a bad review.I never ever ever Leave reviews for establishments because I don't like the public platform for them but in this case I just felt it was my responsibility to do so. also, because I decided not to leave a note or speak to anyone with regards to the service... I felt I had to put sit here and hope that they see the review and address everything appropriately.It's slightly even more upsetting because I am a very generous tipper because being in the service industry is one that I know is unappreciated Or at least under appreciated... Which is why I will always tip at least 20% no matter what the service level is - as I did at Nce-Matin that night - but on average I usually like a tip around 30% for good service and 40% for excellent service. He entire experience was... Just, unacceptable for the type of restaurant that this place is.",1,0,0,Michelle K.,"Queens, Queens, NY",0,2,0

3.0,8/13/2018,"First off, I have to say that my server deserves a 5. She was sweet, personable, knowledgeable about the menu and overall one of the best servers I've had in NYC.  Unfortunately I did not get her name but she was a very young girl maybe recently out of high school.  The ambiance also gets a five.  Beautiful decor and not too loud nor busy on the evening I went.  There was no wait for my table in doors.  The food. I had such high hopes but unfortunately the food just didn't deliver, hence the 3 rating. Everything looked perfect and sounded delectable but some how there was a miss on my risotto.  It seemed to be lacking in the flavor department and some pieces of the corn were prepared inconsistently.   The tuna tartare was better but again nothing significant or memorable.  Needless to say I would go back and try my items again along with a few other dishes.  I'm not writing this place off just yet.  Update: I (regrettably) went back for brunch. I got the salmon with eggs, toast and potatoes.  The food again was nothing spectacular or memorable. It was simply ordinary so the 3 rating is maintained @ the food.  Unfortunately service this day would barely qualify for a 1.  My main server was great but the secondary server has sealed the deal for me never returning to this establishment.  The level of rudeness and arrogance the secondary waiter exhibited while just serving food is mind boggling. Secondary server brought out my food, slammed it on the table and hurriedly scurried back to lean on the bar as I tried to stop and ask him for ketchup for the potatoes (note: this was my first interaction with him).  He barely glanced in my direction and simply pointed at the condiment that was on the table previously from the first server (note the condiment was jam for my toast, not ketchup).  So I proceeded to eat the bland, dry potatoes since attitude had no interest in assisting and primary server was no where to be found.  Fast forward to the check, main server takes the check and my credit card. Secondary attitude server returns with the check but not my credit card which he again slammed on the table and proceeded to walk away as I tried to get his attention regarding my missing credit card. He absolutely ignored me but the manager heard my commotion and came over to find out what was wrong. I told her and she went and located my card with the right print outs for me to sign.  My rude brunch was around 10:15 am-way too early for anyone to be in such a piss ass mood when serving customers.  Unforgivable.  And speaking honestly, I didn't given my usual 20-25% tip because of the rudeness but instead closed to 15%  (very sorry to the good server and hope you you never are put with the loser again).",2,0,0,Amor E.,"Manhattan, NY",2,26,34

It was probably freshly squeezed but perhaps they should have left some pulp in there. Anyway, service was only lukewarm. I had trouble getting the waiters attention to order, then the bill came before I even finished half of my orange juice. As a result I intentionally let the bill sit on my table, but they came to retrieve the bill assuming that I had put my card in it. After I said no i haven't, they left me alone. But when I finally put my card in, i again had trouble getting anyone's attention to get it from me, so I had to walk to a service counter to pay, kinda like in a deli.

4.0,7/6/2018,"I hadn't been to Nice Matin in several years but we went recently and it was just as good as I remembered it. It tends to be a bit noisy but not oppressively so. The staff is friendly and competent without crossing your boundaries. It's a bistro with an extensive menu that leans French. The food is a bit expensive, or maybe moderate for that type of restaurant, so I'd say go for a casual but special occasion or if you're someone who can spend $20 on a hamburger and fries without getting upset. If you order that hamburger, you're going to like it, because it has added touches that make it special, in this case, a creamy peppercorn cheese sauce and onions that have been cooked down so they're very sweet. One of my companions had hanger steak that she rated 5 stars, and the other had a pork special heaped with arugula and eggplant that he really liked. We drank a bottle of a good rose wine (no idea about the price of wine because my friends covered the bill - lucky me). Nice Matin is not a restaurant for everyday.

The downside are the prices, but the prices are understandable since it's attached to a hotel. If you're coming in from the outside though, I don't think it's worth it.

4.0,4/14/2018,"It was Friday, 80 degrees out, and we were on the hunt for some outdoor sidewalk seating. We chose Nice Matin because it was the first place we saw that had open tables. Everyone else in NYC apparently had the same idea, so it got totally slammed quickly. The service was a little slow, but our waiter kept apologizing. Some people sitting around us were annoyed by how long their drinks were taking, but since we were enjoying the nice weather and people watching, we really didn't mind. The ambiance and decor inside the restaurant is warm and cozy, and bathrooms were clean.They have an enormous wine list, but we decided to start off with an aperol spritz. We had the octopus and burrata as an appetizer, both of which were amazing! We also had the arugula salad and the kale salad (forgot to get a pic). The arugula salad was a little lacking, although I don't think it was meant to be an entree salad. The kale salad on the other hand was fantastic. I would eat kale every day if I could have that salad! A few people around us got the mussels and frites, which we will probably try next time. Their dessert menu also looked incredible.

We sat outside by the sidewalk to enjoy the nice weather. I ordered the Tuscan Chicken, which was $25 and came out dry and unimpressive. My friend ordered a Hanger Steak, which was $28 for a big slab of meat and un-appealing presentation--limp fried potato strings sat on a soggy bed of spinach.As for the staff: the waiter was incredibly nice and patiently helped us find the perfect beer to order.

3.0,2/5/2018,"I went to Nice Matin this past Sunday for a birthday dinner with my parents, who were visiting from out of town. Initially everything was perfect. The hostess was sweet and accommodating and although we were early for our reservation was able to seat us right away. Our waitress was extremely attentive  and went out of her way to find an unusual brandy we asked for. Her service and demeanor were exceptional. However the one damper to my experience here was the food runner. I do not usually write reviews but I feel the management needs to be aware of his behavior. I had ordered the chickpea fries. Because of a dietary restriction I am unable to eat the aioli that came with the fries. I asked him for ketchup and he glared at me and said ""no, the dish comes with alioli."" I again repeated that I would please like a side of ketchup and he rolled his eyes at me. After he left, my mom said ""Wow that guy gave you quite a nasty look"", which confirmed I hadn't imagined it. Given its reputation and longevity, I expected a higher standard of service at Nice Matin. Our waitress and hostess went above and beyond. However this employee displayed a churlish attitude that played upon the ""snobby"" French restaurant stereotype. It put a damper on what was supposed to be a celebratory meal. I should note that the food here is exceptional and fresh. I had a lentil soup and kale salad with apples and celery, chopped finely. We all enjoyed our meals and ate every bite. If this review was solely based on food and ambience it would easily be a 5 star review. I should also note- during our meal I noticed a cockroach scurrying underneath an adjacent table. This is New York and a common issue so it did not bother me as much. However the restaurant's health rating is under review so if you go I'd recommend going if the rating is an A. I'm sure it will get there and the problem will be fixed, but I'd wait it out until it is.",1,0,0,Cara V.,"Astoria, NY",0,3,0
2.0,1/30/2018,"Had an impromptu and walk in dinner there last Saturday. The moment the hostess realized that we didn't have a reservation the visit started to sour and if hindsight were 20/20, we should have left again. We were told that  a table was available, but that it had to be vacated in 1 1/2 hours. No problem... Our server must have been aware of this; we were rushed from the moment we sat down, weren't given any time at all to look through the rather voluminous wine list, and were ""pressured"" into ordering right away. Additionally she must have felt that if she spoke more than 3 words to us we would spend even more time there...The food was good, the wine was fine, and overall a good time was had, until this: plates were cleared, desserts were declined (after above mentioned server presented us with dessert menus by throwing them on the table and muttering the word dessert under her breath), and we wanted to finish the remains of our wine, when the server dropped the check on the table before we could ask for it.

The sommeliers are helpful and committed to making sure diners have wines that pair well with the food (not just the most expansive bottle on the list). I would eat at Nice-Matin for the service even if the food were bad :-)But the food is always WONDERFUL. I can't point to any one dish in particular because I have never had a bad meal there, and I've tried everything on the menu but the spicy salmon. I have spent a lot of time in Nice, France, and have not eaten better there than at Nice-Matin.This restaurant is very popular, so you need to make reservations.

The wastepaper basket was overflowing.  The toilet seats were covered in urine.....and the floors were sticky.  I had to encourage my dad to go back to my apt to use the bathroom.",1,0,0,Patrick O.,"Manhattan, NY",0,9,0
1.0,9/11/2017,"Poor service and cold food. We arrived and were seated quickly. Waitress was pleasant. We ordered drinks and then things started to go wrong. They delivered the wrong wine. Then they brought our appetizer to a neighboring table. After eating our appetizer, we then waited about 40 minutes for any mention of our entrees. When we finally saw the waitress again and asked about our food, we were told the manager would bring it and it took so long because ""they were waiting for the fries to drop"" and everything else was ready. This made it sound like our food was sitting there ready and getting cold while the fries cooked. When the food arrived, it was obvious this was the case. The food was cold and the steak sandwich bread was soggy to the point of being stuck to the plate. For $20 entrees, it was unacceptable. We asked for our bill (which they kindly took the food off of) and left and got chipotle, a more consistent option. Definitely won't be going back.",0,0,0,John M.,"Chicago, IL",0,2,0

That being said, it's still a fine spot for brunch or dinner.It's right under The Lucerne on 79th and Amsterdam, and I think they get a good amount of business from people staying in the hotel. Crowd is older, especially on weekdays, though on weekends there are some families with kids at brunch. It can get busy on weekends, so good to make a reservation. I think Nice Matin is at its nicest when the weather is good and they open up the doors/windows -- they also have a good number of outdoor tables.Food is French with a range of omelets, sandwiches, larger dishes, and some pizzas.

2.0,4/23/2017,"As a guest of Lucerne Hotel and my partner having had multiple visits to the restaurant for breakfast, I can assure you the service was reliably pathetic. My observations led to me to conclude it's a top down issue and not related to the individual servers, who seemed overworked and stressed, having never smiled and frequently sighing.  The problem starts with the host staff, who clearly have no training on forming a wait list and giving estimates in wait time and preparing guests to be seated. The next issue is the bus stuff who are not rapidly cleaning dirty tables to free up for waiting guests. The bus staff would be able to work more quickly if the servers did a better job of pre-bussing the tables. In addition, the servers often were too quick to walk away from a table, making it difficult to ask for some extra jelly or a top off of coffee. The food itself was marginal. The bacon seemed to be cooked in an usual grease or have a slightly unusual flavor, not bad but just different. I can honestly say the Eggs Benedict I ordered had the hardest English muffin I have ever had. When your knife can't cut it, that's a problem. And last but not least, the coffee was horrible: use the cream if offered. If you are a Lucerne Hotel guest please pay attention to the discount times.",0,0,0,Ryan M.,"Oklahoma City, OK",12,98,22

Now I'm no expert on these things because until early March of this year I was opposed to the concept of tomato juice mixed with alcohol. However, I've now had my fair share since then and this one ranks dead last. Not to mention it was served in a plastic glass...I know I look young, but I'm not a child. I can drink my Bloody Mary out of real glass. The spicy lamb and sausage scramble sounded intriguing, but was rather bland and CERTAINLY not worth $18! Absolutely outrageously priced for the quality, and it's not like it was a huge portion either. You can say, ""oh yeah this is New York that's what brunch costs fuhgedaboutit!!"" No. It does not. I had to walk past about 15 places that weren't even remotely as expensive as this to get here. The decor is dated and it looks like a retrofit diner?

When I informed the manager of the store, she didn't even offer to comp us for anything. So, having managed before, that was just a huge red flag to me that she just didn't care. And that trickles down. Advice: head up on Amsterdam.  Or walk an avenue to Isabella's.  There are so many other amazing UWS restaurants with more innovative menus, atmosphere and nicer people.

After my group was seated it took 20 minutes before anyone acknowledged us to ask our orders. Once our orders were taken, it was very difficult to get anyone's attention to ask for additional utensils. Our table was not given bread even though we could see all the tables around us being served a basket. When we asked if we could get some bread, we were given a few small slices. Our water glasses were not refilled once throughout the entire lunch. You might argue that maybe it was because the place was busy. I'd agree, if it weren't for the fact that we could see all the surrounding tables being attended to MULTIPLE times. The only difference with our table? Aside from one member of our party, the rest of the table was all minorities..something that could not be said about the surrounding tables.

Mr. Cheng, immediately addressed and invited us back for a different experience and his handling of the situation was flawless! I found I was able to delete the prior review and start from scratch.  As the neighborhood is now the Macy's Thanksgiving Balloon Blowing extravaganza area (I seem to recall a downtown 10th Ave location for that madness, no?), the hostess, Sara, was incredibly gracious & understanding when we called to say we were finding parking challenging.  For this visit, we had a great server, Josh, who was personable, knowledgeable about all the food and had several spot on recommendations.  I had the escargot to start, which were positively divine and cooked to perfection.  My guest had the French Onion soup that she raved about, so I stole a quick sample and she was right, very traditional and delicious.  For my entree, I had the Tuscan Chicken; succulent, packed with a beautiful balance of flavor and perfectly done root vegetables.  My guest had the Chicken Paillard, very unusually done with the chicken below a wonderful mix of fresh greens, looked to be cucumbers, tomatoes & fresh ruby red grapefruit segments.  It was bursting with flavor. The bussing crew were unobtrusive and waited until we had both finished before clearing. Last, but certainly not least, was the dessert.  We had to try the honey ice cream that was so good, it's hard to describe, but do not miss it.  That was just to sample.  My guest had the creme brulee, which I passed on trying, but it looked gorgeous, topped with slices of fresh fruit and was gone before I could blink.  I had the banana copue which was a pillowy, lightly banana flavored concoction with caramel corn on the top - absolutely fantastic!  The immediate move to remediation - 10, service - 10, ambiance - 10, food - 10.  Hands down, a spectacular experience, kudos to the staff and thank you for a memorable night!  We will definitely be back!",0,0,0,Kay A.,"Bronx, NY",44,70,58

Pros: - Open early- Food was decentCons: - BAR SERVICE: I was sitting with my husband and two kids waiting for our table. Bartender completely ignored us. Even my 7 year old son asked ""Does he see us, Mom?"". I would have left but it was literally one of the very few places open and we were hungry. Ok, so after he finally comes around, we ask for fresh orange juice. Orange juice came full of seeds. Really?! So I ask him to strain it and he says the straws would stop the seeds from coming out. I almost laughed, but saw he was serious. It's ridiculous to even have to ask. Clearly he was being an ass to us, because as I looked around no customer had seeds in their orange juice.

5.0,10/5/2016,"This French bistro hit the spot.  After exiling myself to Hawaii for the last couple of years, I was in serious need of some Continental food.  We went for mid-week lunch, and it wasn't crowded, just very pleasant.  The manager greeted and seated us, and a waiter came over immediately to take our drink order.  Another server delivered it, and a fourth person brought us bread.  I feel like the whole staff wanted to make us comfortable.The butter and olive oil served with the bread was the correct temperature (room temp.) even if the bread itself was also room temp. - warmed up would have been nice.  We ordered off of the prix-fixe menu, but there were other amazing options a la carte.  One server really raved about the steak sandwich with bleu cheese - I would have loved to try it, but I can only eat so much!  We each went for the 2-course option, and between us, we got the pate and trout, the cassoulet and mussels.  Everything was excellent.  I wanted to draw out the pleasure of eating the mussels, so I took half home, and they were still amazing the next day.  Slightly spicy, a really nice sauce, plenty of garlic and tomato.Did I mention that the portions are big?  I had to hold off finishing the pate (with toast, and lightly dressed lettuce) to wait for the main course.   The only odd thing was the candied walnuts, which came in a clump and were awfully hard to navigate onto the bread - I guess it was there to pick up and chomp into?  It would have made a nice counterpoint to the pate, if it came in smaller pieces.We never wanted for extra bread with the sauces or spreads, they brought more when they saw we were getting low.  They kept the water filled, as well as the glasses of prosecco.  More people came as we sat there, it seems to be a neighborhood favorite.**Thank you, Maurice, for your impeccable, attentive service and easy smile.**",0,0,0,Schuyler G.,"Kapaa, HI",4,31,7

I started with the escargot, which was garlicky, herbaceous, and a good rendition of the classic French appetizer. For an entree, I ordered the duck with wild rice. The duck was a bit bland and needed quite a bit of salt to bring the dish up to par.

My friend and I went for resto week. The menu options sounded good on paper. I got the pumpkin gnocchi and she got some mystery pork product. Well, she ordered the mystery pork product. What she got was a root veg tart that looked like it was happy to escape from the lights it had clearly been sitting under for hours. We had to wait for the right app to come out which took longer than it should for food that was pre-plated. My gnocchi were decent but I am not sure they were actually pumpkin. We both had cod for the main dish. I liked the farro or whatever it was served with but the cod itself was like my last date - no spice. For dessert, she ordered a banana caramel cake and I chose the lemon tart. She was served something coconut. So now 2 of 3 of her courses were served wrong. 2 of 3 preplated courses. Let that sink in. We killed time waiting for the right dish to come by calling over the manager who comped us the 2 glasses of wine we had.

5.0,1/3/2016,"A true gem: a non-touristy French bistro on the upper west side with fabulous food and reasonable prices (and Parisian style brusque waiters).We've been coming to Nice Matin for years, and always marvel at what a gem it is. The atmosphere is very Parisian, squint and you can almost imagine that you're in Paris. Every dish we've had there has been outstanding, which is especially amazing given the reasonable (for Manhattan) prices. The salads are always fresh, and never overly saturated with dressing. The Nicoise (tuna) salad is especially satisfying, and the kale salad among the best we've ever had. The fish dishes are consistently fresh, well prepared, and 'simple' without being overwhelmed with sauces and spices.Breakfast/brunch is always fun. The omelettes and egg dishes have quality, creative ingredients. The oatmeal is also high quality and worth getting. Even the simple 'grapefruit slices' are delicious, on a bed of granola (though not a large portion - one grapefruit probably makes 4 of those dishes). The simple 'basket of toasted breads' brings 4 slices of different breads with butter, jam, and marmalade, and is a perfect light breakfast with a pot of tea.The only downside is the waiters also take the role of working to the 'French' style a little too seriously, and can be inattentive and brusque. Don't expect a refill of your coffee cup unless you flag one down, and also don't expect any small talk or smiles out of them. Anywhere else and it might be considered rude behavior, but at Nice Matin, it's all just part of the Parisian experience.",0,0,0,Rob L.,"Portland, OR",1,117,65
4.0,1/3/2016,"Nice Matin is what I would consider an UWS neighborhood staple French eatery. I pass by it often and normally see hordes of people enjoying their meals in the patio area, but I never really thought to myself, ""Hey, why don't you actually go inside and try the food and drinks?"" So, I did. I went inside and tried and food and drinks. I listened to my own inner thoughts. When you walk in, it's huge. Lots of bright lights and it mirrors a very Mediterranean vibe. I ordered a glass of the Pinot Blanc which is a white wine but flavored with deep Pinot fruits, hence the blending of the name. Because, we had already eaten, we shared an order of the duck liver mousse to nosh on and it was outstanding. It reminded me of my travels to Nice, France. The French Riviera is one of the most beautiful areas in the world. French food when done right is probably the most decadent food out there and the mousse did not disappoint. There was this layer of plumish, black coating on top of the mousse, which tasted like a balsamic reduction, and it cut through the richness of the liver. The mousse came with a side of salad, some walnuts and crusty bread. We spent a considerable amount of time there, that's what happens when the ambiance is that welcoming. When I looked up and took a gander around the restaurant it was packed, a clear indication that Nice Matin is not going anywhere, anytime soon.",5,2,3,Soo Jin K.,"Oakland, CA",590,389,558

It simply stated 15% anytime between 6-11am Monday-Friday. What terrible customer service. Additionally, one person ordered rye toast instead of the standard bread basket that came with her eggs, and the restaurant charged us for a side of bread because it wasn't the bread that came with the dish.

1.0,12/6/2015,"Completely mediocre for they hype about this place. We got there at about 10:50  on a Sunday, which was nice because we got right in, but that was about the highlight. We were a party of three and initially we were seated at a table that comfortably could handle 2. The seating at this establishment is such that they have small two-tops and slightly larger two-tops and the hostess sat us at a larger two-top. The table was right up against a median and I could see if the one side fit a small child and an adult, but absolutely not two adults. When we asked if we could be moved to a table that could reasonable fit three adults we were told that we couldn't and that there was going to be a long wait for that table. Then when we tried to arrange our coats, the hostess rudely told us that we were going to have to hang them because they were encroaching on the other table (no kidding!). We legitimately tried to make the table work but my boyfriend and I couldn't move our arms because we were pressed up against each other so tightly. My friend, on the outside of the table got up and requested that we move. There simply was not a comfortable spot. The hostess again gave her a difficult time, then came over and in a huff told us she would move us to a four-top. When we went to get use she snapped ""Wait, I need to pull the table out"". I think it started off the meal in a negative tone. Once we were seated at a table that actually was comfortable, we ordered. The service was sporadic (we kept having to ask for coffee and water refills) and I ordered the Gruyere omelet. I am not super picky about eggs, but when they are browned and then black in spots, they are clearly overcooked. Also, we ordered a side of sausage. It was so so spicy for a breakfast sausage. My friend had dried out potatoes. In short, the experience was a little hostile, and the food was not great at all. I won't be back.",5,0,0,Liz M.,"Manhattan, NY",41,139,26

Good start.Interesting menu, plenty of Veggie choices and fairly reasonable prices for this neighborhood!The prix fixe was quite a deal, $38, mix and match several choices including a risotto appetizer and a steak au poivre with any dessert which I ordered. The risotto was excellent, steak was quite a nice serving size- done exactly as requested and the panna cotta was luscious.Friends had the octopus which was highly recommended, very tender. Mussels in a red sauce, the frisee salad, kale salad, all were rated exceptional. The lamb, and the NY strip steak also highly recommended. Nice wine list by the bottle with some very high end choices. Service was perfect, Take note of the bread serving, a nice fresh baked roll with the butter sitting in an olive oil  dipping sauce. Had not seen that done before and it was sinful. As noted, the Panna Cotta was excellent as was the caramel salted ice cream dessert. All in all a very memorable meal, way above average,Highly recommended. Check out the nightly specials, each night a different offering, Saturday was duck.

1.0,11/27/2015,"I have been to Nice-Matin over a dozen times in the last year or two as it is a local restaurant near our apartment.  The food is fine and generally we have had good experiences there.  I decided to try it out for a large party of family members for Thanksgiving, some of whom were visiting from out of town. I made a reservation for ten people a month prior and specifically asked if we would be OK with such a large party and they responded that we would.  I also called to confirm two hours before our actual reservation on Thanksgiving day as nobody called and I wanted to make sure nothing was amiss.....they assured me again that the table was reserved and ready for us. Our party arrived all together at 6:00PM and were told the table wasn't quite ready yet.  After 15 minutes I inquired about the status of our reservation again and was sheepishly told I now needed to speak to the Manager, whom she pointed out to me.  He never initiated any contact with our party.  I walked over to him across the room and asked about our table. He said there was a slight  delay earlier in the day(15 minutes) but now our table would be at least another 45 minutes.  I asked which table it was and after he pointed it out, I commented that since they were just getting entrees, there was no way it was only going to be 45 minutes...which would have been an hour past our reservation anyway. The actually delay would have been closer to 90 minutes.  Additionally, how could a fifteen minute delay at 2:00PM result in over an hour delay for us?  Clearly, he was not being truthful.  He then said, ""how about I just divide your party into two separate tables?""   I explained to him that this was a Thanksgiving family dinner and the whole point was to be together.  When I called earlier that day, why didn't they tell me they wouldn't have a table as you already knew?  To make a long story short...... the Manager was marginally rude, completely unsympathetic to how they had ruined a festive occasion and appeared almost insulted that we weren't grateful to be split up in two different tables for a Thanksgiving dinner. It is shocking to me that he seemed so devoid of any responsibility or concern.  At the very minimum, a sincere apology would have been appropriate.  Never ever....has a restaurant experience been so rude, insensitive and frustrating and I hope the owners read these reviews....as it is the first time I have ever been so motivated to write one!!!!",0,0,0,Jon M.,"Manhattan, NY",0,2,0

There was WAY too much goat cheese that it overpowered any flavor of avocado or egg. It was also under salted.

4.0,9/13/2015,"I came here for a late evening dinner on a Saturday. Surprisingly, over the large volume of people who were waiting, I was seated promptly after 5 minutes. When I sat down, my waiter came and took my order. He was very nice and knowledgeable on the different dishes of the menu. The menu consisted of a extensive list of wine and alcoholic beverages, and some variety of entrees. For my appetizer, I ordered the ""Escargot"" and ""Crispy Calamari."" Both tasted phenomenal. The escargot was very rich and creamery with a little bit of a chewiness texture, and the crispy calamari tasted wonderful along with different spices combine together in the dish.For my entree, I got the ""Lamb Top Sirloin."" I believed that this dish was a little overpriced for its portion because my sirloin was very small and the vast majority of my plate consisted of corn, tomatoes, cucumbers, and feta. Aside from the price, the 1oz. lamb sirloin was juicy and moist, and it was pre-sliced into four parts. The spicy ""Orecchietta Primavera"" pasta tasted delightful, and a great dish for vegetarians since it doesn't consist of any meat. For dessert, the ""Vanilla Creme Brulee"" with mixed fruit was one of my favorite for dinner. It's very light and the mixed fruits of blueberries, strawberries, and blackberries was very filling.

I can definitely see how this place can get packed for brunch. My friend and I sat inside and was quickly greeted by a server. I didn't catch his name but he was very attentive and nice. No problems or complaints with him. It may have been because there was only 2 or 3 parties indoors (about 5 parties outdoors) but nonetheless service was great. I ordered the nice burger ($19.50). Which is super rare to me because I almost never order burgers at restaurants. But theirs sounded really good! My friend got the hanger steak($23.50). The burger was moist and delicious. The bun was crisp on the outside and fluffy on the inside. The sauce from what I remember tasted similar to a thousand island mixture? Fries were the thin type and were yummy as well. My friend  enjoyed her hanger steak. It came on a bed of spinach which was yum too. They have a great selection of wine for all you wine drinkers. I'm a beer person so opted to get the pale ale ($8) they had. They have about 5-6 beers on tap which was a big plus for me! For dessert we got the peach moussintine ($5.50?)...sorry I probably butchered the name.haha. It was good but my friend and I were saying how we couldn't get the taste of the peach. I really liked the basil ice cream it came with. You reaaaaaally have to appreciate basil to enjoy this scoop. Just a heads up! I give this place a thumbs up! But maybe a little pricey overall.

2.0,8/3/2015,"I love this place. The food is great, the ambiance too. So my review is a bit of tough love hoping they care to be the best at what they do.My complaint is with the staff barista skills. They need to train their staff how to properly steam milk for a latte. Twice I've been there recently, and twice they scalded the milk to the point where the drink was sour and almost too hot to bring to my lips. I didn't bother complaining because it's awkward trying to explain such things to a waiter, and I didn't want to be a problem customer. Properly steamed milk should be no more than 140-160F tops. This accentuates the natural sweetness of the milk without souring it. The moment you can't hold a finger to the pitcher for more than a second, it's done. You don't even need a thermometer.NY standards for fine coffee have risen exponentially in the past few years, and if you're going to charge $4.25 for a latte, it should be at least as good as Irving Coffee Roasters across the street. To the nuts who demand boiling hot coffee which is basically ruined, you can always nuke it for 15 seconds when they complain. They can't taste it anyway.

I just feel as though people should know where they are going to spend their hard earned money that going into this establishment means that the food is mediocre at best and how you will be treated by the staff and management!!! the 3 and a half star rating shows that I am clearly not the only one dissatisfied.......,5,1,1,Amavi D.,"New York, NY",172,76,7
2.0,6/13/2015,We had high expectations but were disappointed. Service was poor. We actually had to ask the waiter if they had specials and waited for long periods without attention.

2.0,6/1/2015,"My friend and I came on for Sunday brunch, enticed by the outdoor seating. While our food was delicious (and plentiful), there were some serious management problems. It took 30 minutes to get our drinks and after we finished eating, no one cleared our plates or asked if we wanted to see a coffee/dessert menu. For 45 minutes! Our waiter kept walking right on by. When we eventually got out bill, we were given the wrong checks to sign for and had to wait for the manager to sort out all the transactions.",1,0,0,S.X. A.,"Manhattan, NY",5,108,0
1.0,5/31/2015,"The food was good, been here at least 5 or 6 times, a little overpriced, but well executed. But they get 1 star, because as is typical with about a fifth of NYC restaurants, there is obviously a waiter on staff that decided to illegally pad his/her tip. So I got a bill on my credit card statement for $70 for a quick early morning breakfast with no cocktails. Knew this didn't look right, and when I went back to check the receipt found it not to be.

My dining partner had the pan seared branzino (fish), encrusted with thin-slivered potato, on a bed of sauteed greens. Big wine list. Had a glass of Costiere de Nîmes white wine. Delicious.

They offer a discount on breakfast for those staying at the hotel. Their menu looked so appealing that I had lunch and dinner there too on occasion. In fact, it has become my go-to restaurant when I want to get together with old friends and sometimes with clients because the food is delicious and it is a warm and inviting atmosphere especially in the evening. I love the scallops, and during the winter, their stews are wonderful.

My granola bowl was really big but it was crunchy and good. The only problem was that the seating was arranged weirdly and so everytime a waiter passed, we got hit or our bag got knocked off the chair. Service itself was not great either because they messed up our check and have us someone else's credit card and it took another 30 minutes to get the correct check.

The rest of us ordered off of the regular menu. I had the tuna tartare appetizer & the daily special which was sea scallops. Both were outstanding. Our friends ordered a variety of dishes & to the best of my knowledge, they were all pleased, including the gluten-free diner.

First was that the table was just way too small. I'm a little person and I didn't fit in the tiny space they had us at. My second concern was that they only had one vegetarian option.

3.0,3/6/2015,"Came here with a bunch of friends for a birthday celebration on the last day of restaurant week! This is definitely a fancy restaurant but not to the extent where you feel underdressed in casual clothing. The waiter that we had kind of gave off a snooty attitude but it's not the worst service I've experienced.Appetizers:Kale salad- Wow if salad always tastes this good I would eat it everyday! I really liked the kale and the vinaigrette dressing!Goat cheese tart- A rather salty appetizer but I like salty food! The goat cheese had a sharp taste that I enjoyed and the bacon on top was good. It didn't seem like they complimented each other that well though.Ceviche- Very refreshing and definitely a great appetizer to open up your taste buds!Entrees:Ricotta gnocchi- The texture of the gnocchi was great and I also loved the mushroom/parmesan sauce but the portion was so little! It's listed under appetizers on the regular menu but for restaurant week its under entrees wtf??Duck confit meatloaf- The duck was a little dry but the fact that its a meatloaf explains why. I did enjoy the taste though and I thought the veggies and mashed potatoes complimented the duck very well.Desserts:Cranberry walnut tart- This had a very rich walnut flavor which I liked but overall it was a bit too sweet for my liking.Citrus panna cotta- The first few bites were delicious because the orange on top balanced out the sweetness of the cream on the bottom! But after the citrus was gone, it became a bit too heavy and sweet. It needs some citrus flavor on the bottom too to balance out the sweetness/heaviness!Fig bread pudding- I took a bite of this and thought it was pretty good!Vanilla creme brulee- Loved the brulee on top! The creme, again, was just a bit too sweet for me.Overall I would rate this as a slightly less than average restaurant week experience. The food, while tasty, came in very small portions and were not exactly filling. Decor was great but service was only average. I would recommend trying out someplace else during the next restaurant week!",2,0,0,Kevin E.,"Brooklyn, NY",84,612,973

4.0,2/11/2015,"I stumbled upon Nice Matin with my boyfriend one summer Sunday afternoon. We were looking for a place to eat, specifically brunch, and walked all around until we stopped in front of the restaurant. ""This looks like a good place, let's try it."" I said. I love it when you unexpectedly try a new restaurant (not knowing what to expect) and end up finding a gem. The brunch selection was great. I ordered the Ratatouille Eggs Benedict Provençal, my boyfriend ordered the soft scrambled eggs with smoked salmon, and we shared a plate of frites. Both dishes came with roasted potatoes and a side salad. My dish was beautiful - a light tomato sauce and roasted vegetables covered my poached eggs which sat on a pillow of puff pastry. Soft scrambled eggs and smoked salmon was simple and delicious, you really can't go wrong with that. Only issue with my meal was that the frites were too salty. However, it was a truly relaxing brunch as all the doors/windows were opened and it just finished raining. I'd definitely come back for brunch!",0,0,0,Doris T.,"Queens, NY",109,52,34

It was as good as the bread in Paris...maybe better. The service was excellent. We had our daughters with use who had short rib ravioli and a hamburger. As a wimpy follower (from Popeye) the burger was huge and delicious. The Ravioli was okay...not bad but not awesome like my order. My wife had scallops that were fresh but could have been cooked just a tad more. We sat in one of the booths and that added to the great experience. I would definitely go again.

Seated quickly at a cozy table (Parisian size) but at which we three men were comfortable. The pleasant and attentive service continued with our waiter, sommelier and bus boys/runners.  The menu was thorough and again read like a classic Parian bistro.

I was dining with my boyfriend and an older family friend couple who suggested the place.  We started with some wine and cocktails. We split an arugula salad, which they divided for us in the kitchen - a step beyond which is always appreciated!  I had the Chicken Paillard for my main, the two guys had the Prime Burger, and the fellow female diner had the mussels. She prefers them with a white wine garlic sauce, rather than the red sauce they are served with, and the kitchen was more than happy to accommodate.  The burger was among the best I have had in ages. The meat with high quality, all of the veggies and condiments were perfectly sliced, and the shoestring fries were prefect crispy, crunchy and always a great accompaniment to any burger.  The chicken Paillard was pounded thin, and topped with a mix of endive, peppers, onion and a light vinaigrette. Delicious and light! It was such a large portion, I only finished half and was more than full. This could definitely be split between two diners with either an appetizer or dessert and be plenty full.The service was attentive and fabulous and the dining atmosphere was lively and fun for a Friday night, but the crowd was docile and you could still chat with dining companions.

We ordered the Croque Madame which was superb, the steak frites with pomme frittes, also delicious and the strawberry waffle for dessert. That was amazing.

We sat there and waited for her to bring the check for 15 minutes. The wait was so unbearable that we thought about dining and dashing.

I was by far the only person under 35 there. And as I looked around everyone wasn't really eating, more sitting and drinking. I was sat without a menu, thank god I already pre selected what I wanted from the menu stand at the entrance, Tuna tartare n duck breast (requested rare, got more med rare) but the wine election is great, which made meHappy. The only real reason I wanted to write this review is because one of the managers (short Asian man) was going to tables asking how things were, he greeted a two top of ladies beside me (which were ordering nothing) and then he looked at me, we made eye contact, I said ""hello"" and he saidHi and walked off. Why wasn't I asked how my meal was going or anything? I guarantee I spent twice as much as those ladies, had a 120 bill by myself. Had a wonderful red headed waitress that was nice and we got along. But that manager sticks in my head now as a judgmental ass. Yes I'm 27 white male and by stereotype that means I'mCheap? Just rude.

Alas, how could I be so wrong ordering a simple spinach salad and Croque Momsieur? Today, however, I do t think ordering the eggs Benedict would have saved them. A 2:00 pm Sunday shift change was in the works, which allowed us only a brief introduction to our first server , who we never saw again. Entrees took 30 minutes to arrive and when my French sandwich arrived, the seemingly well-crusted cheesy top camouflaged a more serous set of issues - a plain untasted bottom and bechamel clumps that could easily have been mistaken for chunks of butter or roux. We noticed more than 5 dishes go back to the kitchen, which, aft watching so many cooking programs, tells me that the kitchen was not only ""in the weeds"" but taking no care in what they were sending out.

I think the other dishes might've been blander than what is served at other brunch places. The service was definitely below average. We saw the waiter maybe three times? One to take our order, to give us our food, and then to pay. They also made a grandiose effort to clear our tables as we were still there and actually something from one of the dishes fell off and hit someone in our group on the head. Thankfully it was a light piece of garbage. Other than the subpar service, which may not be representative of other servers, I thought this place had a decent brunch menu and very spacious dining.

They were also pretty messy, which would have been fine if we actually had been given five napkins! We ordered one with a side salad and one with fries, both which were perfect.

Most delicious hollandaise sauce ever! Everything was seasoned well, and well made.

Its fancy without making you feel out of place.  It was raining this particular morning and they were ""checking umbrellas"" so people didn't drip water everywhere which, seems like such a smart underutilized idea.

1.0,6/23/2014,"I was just at Nice Martin for brunch this past Sunday, the 22nd of June 2014.  It used to be my favorite place on the Upper West Side to dine, but not anymore.  After waiting over 15 minutes for a table, which isn't all that bad, I watched as our table was given away to people who had just walked in.  Nice Martin does not take reservations for brunch, mind you, so there was no reason for it.  The people had two infants with them, which it was their choice to bring and should not have afforded them seating ahead of other guests waiting.  Instead of the hostess coming over and explaining that she was giving away the table that she had promised earlier to us to the other people that had just walked in, she, I guess, thought we wouldn't notice and said nothing until I asked, ""Did you just give our table away?""   Her response to my question was to offer us a different, smaller, more cramped table next to them, next to a window that had the sun coming through it from outside that I felt would be a little annoying because of the heat.  I declined and asked for something deeper inside the restaurant.  After waiting another ten minutes, they sat us in a nicer location.  The main issue I have is the lack of consideration of not letting us know they were giving our table away to people who had only moments before walked in.  Isn't my money as good as theirs?  And I have always left a big tip for the server.  What's even worse is I live directly across the street from Nice Martin, on 79th, and so it's convenient to go there.  But Sarah Beth's will get my money from now on, where I'm treated better and the hostesses don't think I'm an idiot and won't notice a table promised to me being given away to people who just walked in, causing me to continue to wait, as if my time and presence there is not as valuable.  So disappointed.  Was rude and disrespectful.",3,2,2,Nicole C.,"New York, NY",1,8,1

We decided to dine indoors surrounded by windows on two walls, hip mid-century decor and a cool bar.It was 'Tapas Tuesday' and we ordered the tuna tataki crisps and shrimp lolipops with ginger/soy dip.  Wow! Both were inventive combinations of flavors, textures and colors beautifully presented and even better tasting. Kudos to the chef!The wine list is an enormous 3 ring binder of anything you can imagine.  After starting with cocktails, we opted for a modest glass of Cote de Rhone which was lovely. Hubby had the steak frites with Bearnaise sauce--the best he's had and I had the Spinach Salad which had generous amounts of hazelnuts and Maytag blue cheese along with chunks of beets and pickled onion---amazing!Service was perfect and understated so things moved at a relaxed pace--not always true of NYC dining.

Considering the high prices of their drinks, this is bad management at it's worst, because this is where the money is made, and most restaurants would be asking if I wanted another by the time I received my first.  My second visit with a party of four caused me to watch everyone finish their meal before I was served.  My veal came out cold, hardly even room temperature in a cold sauce, so it was sent back for reheating and arrived back at the table the same way, after two requests.  The waiter was no place to be found.

I didn't want to make a scene, so we let it go. But we were told the wait was 15 minutes. After about 15 minutes a man came in with a party of 12. She told him she'd reserve an area for him that was clearing out. There were multiple tables of 2, when another party of two asked she said they were reserving those tables for the large party that just walked in. She saw I overheard and came over to tell me we were next, I asked about the open tables and she said they were reserved, but they don't take reservations, which was a weird thing to say. Why tell me you don't take reservations but you are. Strange. Then I told her that large party came in after me and she again said they don't take reservations but she needed to make room for the large party so we'd have to wait.

In the 7 years since I first reviewed this restaurant the quality has been seriously diluted... too bad since this was once was a simple but elegant place with delicious and often surprising dishes. Sad to say, Nice Matin has decided to cater to the legions of tourists who stay at The Lucerne and who march en masse to the Museum of Natural History.

In any case, one of the duties of proper management is to insure that ALL of its wait staff is functioning effectively.

2.0,12/31/2013,"Came here for breakfast. Good, but not great. Especially for what you pay; I expected a little more. This notion, however, is SOLELY due to my experience in the many other wonderful places for breakfast and brunch within the same price range and menu. I would much prefer going to Sarabeth's for the two dishes ordered:1) Eggs Benedict2) French Toast with caramelized bananasAnd the biggest reason for to go elsewhere is due to the bakery bread used in both of my dishes! The ""English muffin"" in my eggs benedict was flat, thin, unimpressive, and without the nooks and crannies that Thomas aimed to strive for in the perfect English Muffin. And now to the French Toast- WTF? Did they use a flat wheat bread for this? WHEAT??! The contrast between the wheat bread and [lack of] caramelized bananas was just plain embarrassing.  But let's now talk about the goods: Coffee was perfect. Staff was friendly. Ambiance was beautiful! You definitely get the NYC feel at this location. Big open setup with old New York charm and style. So the dinning experience was actually pleasant, and relaxing. However.... the food.... COME ON!?!Back to the bad already? yes! French toast as I described, was a disaster. Enough said. The Eggs Benedict: nice perfectly poached egg with a warm gooey center, below average thin cut tasteless Canadian bacon, and the biggest slap in the face: the pale white Hollandaise sauce! This sauce is what makes Eggs Benedict quite frankly- Eggs Benedict. Otherwise its just an eggs and bacon on a muffin! The Hollandaise sauce was just a wreck of melted thickened butter! Sad......I'm sure they many have other items on the menu that are more appealing. However, I was not impressed with the food to come back and give them another try. The only reason I would be back in this area, is to view the Banksy Street Art which is now covered in tamper-proof glass.

The fries where too much crunchy and absolutely salted; the bread was not bread but small muffins that you couldn't understand if they where sweet or salted. The tuna was over-cooked but the taste was good as well as the vegetables. But we were really hungry - so we finished everything.The service was also not the best - we had to ask twice for the bread/muffins, ask for water and the general impression was that the waiters were not attentive.

Completely unremarkable. My husband had a chicken sandwich which he didn't complain about (getting a compliment out of him is literally impossible), and my daughter had fruit and a bagel.* Prices are on the high side ($20 salads, $8.50 for a side of fruit, $5 for a bagel).* Why no air-conditioning?The Bottom Line: Despite the 3 star rating I will be back to try Nice Matin again.

Because the place came highly recommended, we walked the 17 blocks to get here from Lincoln Center.One of the reasons we went is they are known for their wine. I had the $16 Cabernet and it was meh at best. The $15 Bordeaux my fiance had was ok. For a place know for their wine, and for the price, the wine was nothing to write home about.We ordered two tapas off the Tapas Tuesday menu. We asked for a recommendation for the third choice and ordered what the waitress suggested. 15 minutes later our wine still hadn't arrived and we had no bread. Then the waitress returned to let us know that they were out of the item she'd suggested.  So we asked for another suggestion. She suggested the goat cheese and tomatoes. I asked what you eat that with, and she said it comes with crutons. I said I needed something more substantial (and healthy); is it something you eat with bread? She said yes, so we ordered it, and off she went.10 minutes later our first two items arrived and so did the waitress to tell us they're out of bread. Ok... So... You're a nice restaurant and you're out of bread... And that's the only reason we ordered the goat cheese... I tried the goat cheese with the crutons it came with and they were hard and tough and chewy and smothered in oil. I took two bites and gave up.  The squash blossom croquettes were the flavor and consistency of the greasiest most deep-friend tempura you can imagine. I ate one bite and gave up. The chickpea pancake was good (though its consistency was like flan), but it was covered in a bell-pepper ragut, which was not mentioned on the menu, and I'm allergic to bell peppers, so I gave up. Too many strikes to count at this point.  The food was mediocre at best. The wine was the same. They were out of everything the waitress suggested. The food and wine both took too long to arrive. Overall, a waste of $54 plus tip, IMHO. It gets 2 stars instead of 1 because my fiancé liked the chickpea pancake and, as an eater of fatty foods, he enjoyed the food too much to allow me to give it 1 star. I, on the other hand, was basically starving most of the meal, and when we left here we went across the street to get something else to eat.",2,0,0,Sivan B.,"New York, NY",61,38,2

4.0,5/11/2013,"I define ""brunch"" in two categories: 1. Bagels & whitefish salad/lox, or pastries acquired from a deli2. Bagels & whitefish salad/lox, or eggs, or waffles, etc. from a restaurantNice Matin would get five stars if judged independently from Category #1, but controlling for deli fare, it gets four stars. Not that there's anything wrong with the place -- far from it -- it's just because there is no better breakfast than a bagel. I am a big fan of their mimosas, and the eggs/pastries/waffles/pancakes/French specialties are great (albeit expensive). The dinnertime onion tart is to die for, as is one of their signature cocktails: some sort of lemony drink topped with sage. Definitely recommended.Another reason to like Nice Matin is the décor: while most French restaurants go for an Art Deco style, this one reaches back into history a bit more and is designed with an eye towards the pre-1930s neo-classical period.",0,0,0,Virginia T.,"New York, NY",5,23,0

The poached eggs were cooked perfectly, and when you cut into them the yolk spilled all over the puff pastry and ratatouille and made a deliciously rich sauce. The pastry was crispy and light, and the ratatouille was sweet and tender and paired really well with the eggs which to me was an unlikely combination. The breakfast potatoes were good, but overall unremarkable.

2.0,1/25/2013,"Highly average French food. But this place gets props for having gluten free options on the menu including gluten free breads. And at a French restaurant no less. So really I would give this place 2.5 stars.Went here for brunch with 2 other people. I had a pistou and a gluten free chicken sandwich with roasted veggies. My pistou was basically a regular vegetable soup and was nothing like the hearty, garlic-y and basil-y vegetable goodness I have had in Provence. If I had never tasted a pistou there I guess I would rate this a pretty good vegetable soup but since I have I dont. My gluten free sandwich was super tasty. I cant tell you the last time I had a tasty sandwich like this (being gluten free and all). The chicken was well seasoned and the grilled pepper and egg plant were a good complement. Not serving the sandwich with mayo or mustard was odd but once I got some mayo on it the sandwich was spot on.Now my dinner mates ordered Salad Nicoise and  an egg dish consisting of 2 eggs over spinach and creamy polenta with a side of breakfast sausage. The salad nicoise was average and the tuna was decidedly not fresh or flavorful. The rest of the salad was tasty but I wouldnt recommend the salad as a whole because the star ingredient was so lacking. The polenta dish was super creamy and tasty though I thought the spinach was a bit underseasoned. The breakfast sausages were huge ( italian sausage size) and delicious.All in all a pretty average to sub average French place.

Good food is good food and good service is an art form. That being said, I am seated here at 10:30 in the morning, and am watching in disbelief as the restaurant handy man readies himself to repair one of the seating booths opposite me. In the middle of service? The peaceful conversation I intended to embark upon with my Eggs Benedict is unceremoniously shattered by the high pitched 'wheeeeeeee' of the drill. My eggs bobble on my fork, and don't look half as enticing to my hungry palate as they did 30 seconds ago. I wait for him to stop, but no, once finished with the one booth he is on to restaurant-wide tiny embellishments--'wheee, wheee, wheeeeeeeeeeeee' goes the drill. My eggs get cold and I feel a little sad because I am only in New York for one day, and was so looking forward to eating out. All of this is being overseen by the watchful eye of the entire staff.

4.0,12/19/2012,"People are happier during the holidays, despite the ""holiday blues"" psychologists would have you believe. If you're alone and miss your family/friends in the middle of nowhere -- or a huge city like Gotham -- I can understand why this happiness would make you feel even worse in your lonely, isolated pathos. But I digress.If you need a reasonably priced excursion as an excuse or a destination to celebrate with friends -- especially during the holidays -- Nice Matin is your place. There's nothing here that's below or even simply average -- everything was well above average and left me wondering why last night was my first time visiting this fine restaurant.First and foremost, I met a group of friends and was the last -- thanks midtown traffic -- to arrive. So everyone had already commenced cocktailing and wine-ing before I dropped my bag and coat with the people at the front of the house. Never the mind, I settled in and caught up rather quickly. We were six, which was a bit cramped table-wise, but regardless, we were doted on by no fewer than four different people and our server was not only helpful but pleasant-humored (we're a finicky, rowdy bunch) and she was the antithesis of stuffy and spent time walking each of us through the myriad choices on this great menu.Four of us wound up doing the prix fixe, which isn't much of a bargain per se; however, the prix fixe offered so many good choices from the main menu that it makes very little sense NOT to consider it, regardless of applicable savings. Several of us had the Tuscan Chicken, which was very good; other dishes were the hangar steak, which was excellent, and the monkfish, which was also solid. Incidentally, we started with appetizers -- half of us ordered the vegetable soup, which based on the reactions was a winner, and a friend and I each had the escargot. To be clear, I don't have an issue with panko-esque bread crumbs topping my escargot and I don't mind the omission of the shells (makes eating escargot that much easier), but while these were delicious, they still weren't nearly as good as Balthazar's. I'm guessing I could be in the finest brasserie in Paris and observe similarly that Balthazar's are still the best, so you can be the judge. Personally, these were an 8 out of 10 and Balthazar's, for me, are a solid 10+. To be fair, I requested a spoon from our waitress to ensure I was able to retrieve all the garlicky, buttery goodness after the snails were fully retrieved, and that is an excellent sign of quality escargot preparation ;-)For entree, I went with the plate du jour, a trio of sausages with homemade sauerkraut and stout house-made mustard. Normally I go with fish or steak when I'm out, and I even considered the Tuscan Chicken (love me some brick-cooked chicken) but the waitress (remember I said she was very helpful?) advised the sausage dish was a true keeper. I also considered the duck -- she maintained her recommendation and she was spot-on. The trio was -- if you are in the mood -- really wonderful. The only thing missing was a Yankee game. Normally I despise sauerkraut -- between the look and odor, I don't recall the last time I had it. If it was prepared as it was last night I'd be eating it daily. Very good, and the antithesis of typical street-vendor, dirty laundry that's been sitting around for a week sauerkraut. Bring it on!Our desserts were above-average as well; pot de creme de chocolat (chocolate puddin' for yez below the Mason-Dixon line), creme brulee, and panacotta. Aside from the panacotta, which was only fair, the desserts were tasty as well. I'd prolly opt to visit Crumbs or Magnolia nearby for dessert in the future, but these desserts were worthy and definitely a solid contribution. It's more likely that we all had such heavy, filling dinners that we had lost our appetites for extraneous calories from chocolate and other sugar-derived stimulation. Put another way, if we'd shared entrees and appetizers the desserts would have been that much better; as it was, they were wonderful and a welcome conclusion to a wonderful dinner.To address my initial point about the celebration of the holidays -- we'd been saying ""One of these days..."" about visiting Nice Matin for years, and I'm glad the holidays inspired us to visit. However, we won't wait for Arbor Day, Valentine's Day or even Secretaries Day to visit again, this is a lovely restaurant that merits a visit regardless of whether it's one of the year's biggest holidays or simply a day that ends in the letters ""day"" -- we enjoyed our dinner and will return again -- the sooner the better.",5,5,5,Boogie N.,"Manhattan, NY",39,151,10

There are ceiling light fixtures that are reminiscent of carousels and look dreamy at night.The brunch here was not great. The coffee had a burnt taste and the lorraine omelet was pretty bland and rubbery. The ""toast"" that supposedly came with the meal was actually the heel of a loaf of bread and misshapen ""pieces"" of bread. They also happened to be burnt. The other people I dined with, however, were very happy with the eggs benedict. If I was to return, I would definitely go for that.For dinner, I tried their five napkin burger on the recommendation of foursquare (where someone claims NiceMatin originated the burger? Is this true?). It was OK. the Five Napkin burger is better at Five Napkin Burger the restaurant. Nice Matin's take was extremely large---the beef patty was gigantic. I ended up having to eat the burger with a knife and fork. Not ideal. The fries were good though. All in all, not worth $20 for this burger.I also tried the grilled lamb sirloin on the recommendation of the waiter and it left something to be desired.

The soup was so hot it burnt my tongue. The steak au poivre was flavorless.  I asked for Bernaise on the side.  The most offensive part of the meal: service. The guy must have been new but he forgot to put in our app order so our entrees came out first. Ok... hello? We had the Prix Fix... so we obviously alert the server (maybe she was a manager, not sure), she was very helpful.  She took over from there waiting on our table.  Now the original waiter never even apologized or asked anything further of our meal.  So, the icing on the cake: when one of the bus boys brought over half of my steak which I requested to go he put the box right on top of my glasses -- they were sent flying across the floor.  He didn't say anything just walked away --- didnt attempt to pick them up. ok....totally unacceptable. I had to search all over the floor for them.Anyway, they gave us a nice discount and the female server who took care of us was totally appreciated but I certainly wouldn't recommend this place or return.",0,0,0,Marissa P.,"New York, NY",150,518,19

4.0,9/22/2012,"Bon Appetit! My meal at Nice Matin rekindled all my NYC dining hopes and dreams that had been squashed by overcooked burgers, vegan brunches, and an exorbitant surcharge for being cool enough to hover over a tv tray in the corner while being ignored by my server. True I was seated at a ""petite"" table in the corner and my waiter was somewhat ""laissez faire,"" but my veal entree and the inviting atmosphere of Nice Matin had me basking in a very comfortable food coma. I was scouring yelp reviews for some help on selecting the entrees, but found reviews complaining about brunch and the small portions of the mussels. Rarely does a diner see VEAL on a menu, so ORDER IT! The good portion of tender meat resting on a bed of sauteed swiss chard and cherry tomatoes was perfectly accompanied by a wine and shiitake mushroom sauce. I normally shy from creamy sauces, but this preparation was savory yet light. BEST dish I've had in recent memory! My friend had the Grilled Salmon dish with asparagus and tabbouleh. The dish was completely different than mine, but also superb. Chapeau! to Nice Matin for the versatility! Our server even asked for my friend's instructions for temperature of the Salmon. Who knew that Salmon is best prepared medium rare? Now I do! I almost became a Salmon fan that evening. Our server was also very polite and knowledgeable about wine. The California Merlot was nearly the cheapest on the menu and still bold, savory, and enhanced the flavor of the food. I rave about the five-star entrees, but I'm reluctant to give Nice Matin the fifth star for the so-so bread basket, the over-priced HALF BOTTLES of wine, the dry walnut cake, and the tres chere soup/salad/appetizer menu (I'm not made of EUROs!)I'm glad I ignored those nasty brunch reviews and ventured into Nice Matin for a very Nice Soir!",2,2,3,Amanda F.,"Chicago, IL",123,123,5

First mistake: We arrived at around 230pm and weren't warned by our hostess that brunch was over at 3. After we sit and order some awful fava bean hummus (more on this later), we are told brunch is almost over and we have to hurry and order if we want brunch food. This is awful service: not only were we not informed before seating, we were rushed. Second bad move: the fava bean hummus was disgusting. For starters this was served with toasted slices of bread, way too much butter and too hard, easily overcooked. The hummus itself was worse, consistency of mayo and the flavor profile was bleak.

We ended up getting a tiny booth in the back, the setting was intimate which me & Ally love but it was slightly annoying to have someone move the table every time I had to get up. Nice Matin has an excellent atmosphere, very informative & friendly staff. We were serviced tap water, mine was warm so being the bourgie chick that I am, I requested ice water. lol. Sorry but warm water doesn't work for me.Our waiter was really nice & went over the specials with us, informing us of his favorites & what about the dish he liked in particular. He recommended the sweet corn flan as an appetizer & we were totally on the same page so I ordered that. The fan with the pancetta was yum. I wish there was more pancetta on it & less of the pepper mixture but it was DELICIOUS! Alessa had the Tomato & Sheep's Milk Ricotta Tart, it was yummy & I was a little jealous because she always get heirloom tomatoes in her appetizers & I adore heirloom tomatoes! lol :)Our entree was the pork loin, is was good, I didn't like the green beans they were extremely sour, way beyond tart. It wasn't something I could enjoy after 2 bites. The puree that accompanied the pork loin was good, very mushy but hey thats what makes a puree. lol.The dessert was omg do it again delicious, I opted for the Pistachio Truffle Cake with Sour Cherry Sorbet & I would eat it every day if I could without becoming a walking blimp! lol. Alessa had the  Lavender Panna Cotta, which she liked except for the excessive Almonds, I picked some of the pistachios off of my truffle cake too. So I guess a girl can have too many nuts. ;)Ally decided to have some Stella, & I asked the waiter for a drink recommendation since they do not have Moscatto as a wine selection, even though their wine list is more like an encyclopedia!  After several options I had the St. Tropez, it was like a mojito with passion fruit foam on it.

A school cafeteria would put this place to shame. Don't get me wrong, I love to overhear an interesting gossip from the table nearby. What's the fun of dining out if you can't badmouth the people who sit next to you or pass by. OK, I am joking maybe, but the fact is that everything combines to a relentless noise of voices, utensils, staff commotion, ugh.OUTDOORI love the outside area though when it is a nice weather. I would have come to this place much often for brunch of breakfast if it was not facing East Side and thus have much more sun that I willing to endure. Evenings can be lovely though. (Another down side with seating outside is a typical  New York problem nothing prevents the occasional homeless guy from wandering right in your face, either asking you for some change, or/and generously sharing with you his not so appropriate body odors. Then the smokers who suddenly decide to enjoy their puffs right in front of your face. It is a public street, you can't pretend to rule who's doing what). FOODFood is great. Of course, it is a matter of taste. Most of the entrees don't appeal much to me, but the appetizers are heavenly. Especially the Grilled Mergez, the Pissaladieres, the risottos etc. I am a fan of escargots as well. From the entrees the Moules Provencal is my favorite, while Fava Bean Tortelloni my favorite pasta.Their Wine List is fantastic. If you are into reading in restaurants, you don't need to bring a book, the thick Wine ""list"" is enough. It will take you a few weeks until you finish with the wine names in their cellar but don't worry I won't tell you how it ends.The aperitifs are great too and there are always gems in the desert menu.

Therefore, Yelp, you get two reviews in one._______________BRUNCH (Four stars)On a whim, my boyfriend & I decided to ""branch out"" and have brunch at Nice Matin instead of our regular place a few blocks from his apartment. This place took Effort (and a subway ride). But oh, was it worth it!We were seated at a small 2-person table in the middle of the restaurant, surrounded by a happy and lively brunch crowd. We started simple: ""Selection of our Ripest Fruits & Berries"" with granola, and two cups of Coffee. The generous serving of fruit was fresh, the yogurt was delicious, and the granola was crunchy. We were starving, and this was the perfect way to get something healthy in our stomachs before we indulged on our main dish.Shortly after we finished the fruit, our food arrived: Orange-Buttermilk French Toast for me, and either Eggs Benedict or Salmon Benedict (I can't remember! Apologies) for him. My French Toast was unlike anything I've had before. Deliciously thick bread, with maple-baked bananas inside, and that hit of orange flavor ...  amazing. Satisfying without being grossly filling, you know?Now that I'm thinking about it, I'm about 60% sure he got the Salmon Benedict. He loves Eggs Benedict in general, and I remember him saying how good it was. I also remember the proof: his empty plate.It was a bit more expensive than our usual brunch, but it was also a bit fancier, with more food, and more atmosphere. We're definitely keeping Nice Matin on our brunch list!_______________DINNER (Three stars)Dinner was a much quieter, more intimate experience than brunch. If I didn't know better, I'd think it was a different restaurant altogether. The dinner menu is more sophisticated, and they offer a Prix Fixe menu as well.I ordered the Grilled Salmon, & he had the Bouillabaisse. We also decided to share a bottle of wine.

My boyfriend is always up for a seafood dish, and he loved his as well.The dinner felt special, romantic, and intimate. The service was impeccable.

There is an platform on the inside wall and we were comfortable, if close, and had good sight lines of the decor and other diners. Service was nice -- an interesting mix of formal and familiar -- attentive but not overly so, good with suggestions and friendly. We had drinks and an entree and that was sufficient.

The food is terrific and reasonably priced for the quality. The bar is a delight. My favorite breakfast is the artichoke and leek frittata (though I do think it might be even better if they used feta instead of ricotta cheese) with their delicious potatoes and baby green salad. The first time I went there it was late at night and there was a sommelier on duty. Coming from LA, where most restaurants are closed by 10pm, this was quite a treat. I already loved this place a bunch but my last visit there -- on a bitter cold Saturday afternoon -- really sealed it forever as one of my top five restaurants.

I do have to say though (and why they got two stars rather than one) that there are tasty moments here.  We had an escargot starter that had plenty of meat and lots of butter, and was pretty good.  (A little cold, still, but not as bad.)  But the odds of actually getting the food you ordered -- and at the right temperature?  I'd call it 50/50.",1,0,0,Robert J.,"New York, NY",1,65,0

Of course, if you picked up the restaurant and dropped it to any other neighborhood that wasn't a barren wasteland of crappy Italian restaurants and frat bars, it would only garner three.I'm grading on a curve. Alas, Nice Matin has its moments. The decor is open, bright and lovely. The wait-staff can be attentive and friendly. The extensive wine list provides real value for us regular folks who don't want to throw away a paycheck on a bottle of vino. The food is rustic French -- giant plates of salad nicoise, small bowls of vegetable soup with a dollop of pistou, a hearty croque monsieur on the lunch menu and an elegant sweet corn risotto in the evening. Unfortunately, the service is very hit or miss. For every waiter I've had totally polite, quick and on-the-ball, I've had another that looked lost, confused the ingredients on a menu item, and neglected flailing hands looking for bread or water. The food is also occasionally lacking. I've noticed that my food is never served hot. Brunch eggs and potatoes were luke-warm at best. A croque monsieur has totally congealed and needed to be sent back. The evening plate of Atlantic cod was cold. I'm not sure if the food is coming up at incorrect times, if there's an industrial-strength air conditioner in the kitchen, or if the waitstaff isn't in communication with the kitchen.

That was a good sign- it meant the condensed menu was good and this was a popular RW spot.However after trying two bites of the Chicken Mousse Timbale I felt nauseated. I would throw up if I didn't have such an aversion to vomiting in general. I'm all for the whacky and the adventurous. I would concede that French food might not be my thing if it wasn't for the fact that I'd had delicious French food in the past.Maybe meat protein and mousse shouldn't be in the same food item name (although I've heard about good salmon mousse). My and my friend's conclusion (after she tried it) was that they had probably made it, froze it, nuked it and served it. Chicken which is supposed to almost be a bland canvas- never tasted more... ""chicken-y""... is the best way to describe my experience. This is probably the closest taste I'll get to raw chicken I think.  Sadly, my two friends' orders of Eggplant Terrine and Grilled Octopus Salad (we each ordered a different appetizer) weren't that great either. The eggplant was okay when smeared with the accompanying cheese and bread but the octopus hadn't been grilled- it had simply been charred to black outside.The sad thing is that the entree (Salmon) and the dessert (Chocolate Marshmallow Tart) weren't bad. They weren't phenomenally great either but would have probably tasted a lot more delicious if it wasn't for the lingering after-taste of that revolting chicken mousse.I would highly encourage them to take that item off all their menus.

(Sigh) So when A decided she wanted to stay at Lucerne just above Nice Matin, I was looking forward to having a laid back lunch / brunch - Nice Matin during the day time - oh la la. I have to admit, the slightly hazy eyes work best for Nice Matin... sun makes it look like every other restaurant... I could be anywhere. The eggs I ordered were very good but egg whites with gruyere and spinach really cannot be super bad. So in hindsight, I urge you to visit here post cocktails for a bite of something and more wine.. pouilly-fume (they have some).

SKIP THIS PLACE.Came here for dinner with a friend on a weekend but it wasn't super busy. We were seated but weren't given any menus or anything for a long time. I actually got up and went to find someone to get menus. Ok - I'll give you a pass. Maybe you're short-staffed or something. But then, no one came to get our order for about 20 minutes. Actually NO ONE came by at all. I tried to wave down someone several times. When a waitress finally came over, she first went to another table that had gotten there after us. The other party actually said to her, ""I think they were here first"" - referring to our table. The waitress leaned over to the guy and actually whispered a snide comment about us being eager and we could wait. Are you kidding me?? She didn't realize I had heard her. So when she finally came over, I told her I'd heard her comment. She acted surprised and confused as if her comment meant nothing. Seriously??? I was about to get up and leave, which we should've done. But instead, we stayed. MISTAKE. The food is remarkably underwhelming and sooo mediocre. My own fault for making a poor decision to give this place a shot. Lesson learned. With so many options in the city, SKIP THIS ONE.

I also tried their truffle lobster mac and cheese. Both dishes were satisfying.  Nice Matin is a lovely, cozy and bustling restaurant (depending on the time of day). I definitely would return for brunch and dinner as the menu offers many delicious treats and seasonal dishes.I highly recommend trying this quaint place if you're ever in the Upper West Side or willing to trek uptown to check it out.",0,0,0,Leslie T.,"New York, NY",79,50,160

I had no idea that soup could taste so good.  Containing my excitement became more difficult to disguise spoonful after spoonful.  I cherished every moment and halfway through the bowl I was so full that I couldn't take another bite.  That is until the server came over and asked to take it away from me.  The thought of wasting something so yummy got me to eat more.  Just when I didn't think it could get any better my entree arrived, grilled salmon with grilled asparagus, parsley tabbouleh, eggplant puree, harissa and zucchini pesto !!! All I can say is that it is the best salmon dish I have had in my life; it was cooked perfectly.

It would be good for a casual date or a night out with a friend - it is not very romantic. Also, I wouldn't recommend it for large groups. The area doesn't have a lot of places to 'stop into' for a drink before after - so its better for a low key night, unless you are planning on taking a cab somewhere after. The pasta dishes are great (I highly recommend the fava bean tortelloni and the short rib ravioli), but the meats leave something to do desired.

Now, let's continue with your regularly-scheduled program:Nice Matin: This is a solid French restaurant featuring fare from the southeast region of the country. We started off with the tuna tartare, which was nothing short of awesome!! Even the chip it came on was ridiculously good! I ordered the steak frites as my entree--yum!!! Steak was cooked perfectly and fries were crisp and crunchy. For dessert, we ordered a smores tart with peanut ice cream which was to die for!!! Actually, I think the ice cream was the best part of the meal...second to the bread and butter, of course!! Service was excellent too! Now I have to disagree with the general Yelp consensus that gives this place 2 dollar signs. How about this: 2 dollar signs if you're rich. 3 dollar signs for everyone else. Most entrees rest in the 20 dollar range, warranting 3 dollar signs in my book.

3.0,2/28/2011,"My favorite thing about Nice Matin was the arugula salad I ordered as my appetizer. It was dressed with extra virgin live oil, fennel and some really good shaved Parmesan and garnished with very fresh, delicious olives. The portion was large enough to split as an appetizer, but it was so good, I wished I had ordered my own!I ordered the Chicken Paillard as my entree. The chicken was pounded and cooked perfectly and all the ingredients were very fresh. It was topped with chopped red and yellow endives and crunchy string beans (which were also chopped into small pieces), halved plum tomatoes, fennel and grapefruit and dressed with a white balsamic vinaigrette. The menu did not mention anchovies anywhere in the description, but I swear I could taste them in there quite strongly in some bites. I hate anchovies, This confuses me, because if there weren't any in this dish, none of the ingredients listed should have been able to produce that pretty distinct flavor. It seems that anchovies are the wrong ingredient to keep secret on the menu. Also, if you're somehow getting that flavor from things that shouldn't taste anything like anchovies, it's probably time to rework the recipe.My boyfriend ordered the Swiss Raclette Mac and Cheese off of the cheese festival menu (this is apparently a week long event that we happened to drop in on). The portion was very tiny, but he really enjoyed it.

By 8:30, the lights were dimmed, and the other customers were dressed to the nines. My style of dress is far too downtown probably for their likes!The reason I adore this place is because of the expansive wine list and the helpful staff. The food was not to die for. My first course gnocchi was very good, but the main course was very much not. The salmon-like fish was too undercooked for me, but the waiter very graciously took it back and brought me a new one. Then after that, my enormous serving of creme brulee with berries dessert more than made up for the seafood mishap. Still, the food overall did not hit a home run on my palate.

The entree I ordered was the fried egg tartine which is essentially a glorified bacon egg and toast with tomato and lettuce, meh.  The side dish of bacon was good, thick cut, crispy and juicy.  Their coffees are also pretty good, smooth and flavorful.  The wifey ordered the eggs provencial which is ratatouille on the bottom of a puff pastry and poached egg.  The pastry again was top notch, the flavors in this dish was almost latin inspired, like a huevos rancheros rendition with ratatoiulle.  Dessert was skipped due to lack of stomach space.  I would try this place again, and would definately try the brunch platter.",0,0,0,Michael L.,"Houston, TX",117,779,260

I never had any interest in Nice-Matin, but on one random occasion I came here for lack of UWS choices and the duck has remained a particularly memorable meal from my years in NY. It was So. Good. I ate it and imagined a world where ducks grew on trees and rained from the sky! It tasted that complete, my mouth experienced every taste point possible.

This is somewhat problematic, as I really like this place, and I'm constantly tempted to hop across the street for a quick burger or steak frites, which is not necessarily the best thing for my waistline...I am particularly a fan of this restaurant's earlier service options. They do a terrific and reasonably priced breakfast, serving anything from an excellent croissant to poached eggs provencal, served with ratatouille in a puff pastry (a triump!).  They have similar offerings at their weekend brunch, only expanded into some lunch items, like the aforementioned problematic burger and steak frites.At dinner the menu becomes slightly more formal. The burger and steaks offerings are complimented by a terrific grilled salmon served with harissa and tabbouleh, an assortment of excellent (and heartily portioned) salads and the excellent ""Duck Magret"" seared medium rare and served with figs and fava beans. Also available is a very reasonalble 3 course pre-fixe, as well as nightly specials. Go on a Friday to try their sumptuous Bouillabaisse,  the best I've had outside of France. There are a few misses on the menu.  The grilled leg of lamb with panzanella was served with far too much sauce and was fairly chewy, and the veal escalope was too mushy and quite bland. Also the restaurant gets quite loud. Not necessarily a bad thing, but worth taking into account depending on what atmosphere you're looking for.

Secondly, we scored a lazyass waitress who never checked back with our table and had the nerve to circle 'tips not included' on the check and drew a big fat smiley face like that's some real cute shit. Way to fish for tip, btw. I concluded my dinner with the worst vanilla bean ice cream known to man. I mean, how do you fuck up vanilla ice cream, right? Cheap quality is what that was. $3 for a lousy scoop even when they planted a lit candle in it for my birthday and told me to make a wish. Oh yeah? I wish...... for places like this to SHUT DOWN.

5.0,7/22/2010,"We made reservations for Nice Matin on opentable and the hostess was very accommodating while we ordered drinks at the bar, choosing to be seated whenever we wanted. They had no problem seating us without our full group, which was a nice change from some snobby places. Nor did they mind us having one less person than our reserved amount.  For drinks I ordered a Green Martini, their version of a cucumber cooler, which was delicious and refreshing. The bartender made her own concoction for Johnny and Ross, which was also delicious. Once we sat at our table we chose a great pinot grigio from the most extensive wine list I've seen, with wonderfully accommodating prices. Toward the end of our meal Ross asked the waiter for a good wine suggestion, which we all worried might be too pricey since we never asked for the price before drinking it, but on our tab we noticed it was only $40. How terrific and honest to find an affordable recommendation. Now onto the food. We ordered lots of appetizers to start:   -The octopus was grilled to perfection, without being too chewy and had a nice soft cheese atop that paired nicely with it   -The escargot was the best I've ever had. Each had the most delicious crunchy buttery stuffing on top, pairing perfectly with the melt-in-your-mouth escargot morsel.   -The beet salad was also perfect. The fresh goat cheese melted with the sweet beets.   -The artichokes were stuffed full of goodness. Best to split between two people and no more though, it's too hard to divide them since they're so small.    -The sweet bread, I'm not a fan of but the rest of the group loved it.   -The bread brought out also came with olive oil drenched butter which was amazing.

Fortunately, I didn't taste any of the above, something I've learned to do when the person who takes my order isn't the one who delivers the food. I had to wait to see our server again each time, and each time have him acknowledge his error. Yet he never apologized in a serious way, The manager, whom I informed after the third incident, offered to take the duck pate off the bill and give us coffee and dessert.

3.0,7/14/2010,"I have eaten at several of the other restaurants owned by the group that owns Nice Matin but only recently had my first experience here. It was...interesting. On a summer's eve (insert douche remark here), my date and I strolled in without reservations and asked for an outside table. The hostess tried to seat us at a cramped 2-top literally on the corner of 79th and Amsterdam. With the street noise and gusting wind, we asked for a larger table on the Amsterdam side and were happy to be moved. We later witnessed two other couples also reject the same table. Perhaps the management should use the space for some busboy buckets or something. Even after the move we were finding it hard to comfortably converse due to the noise and wind. After placing our orders we again asked to be reseated, this time moving inside to a table near the bar. We were assured our waiter would not forget about us, but he did. When we flagged down one of the other servers to try to have our water glasses filled and to check on our meals, he told us that our original waiter -- ""the short Hispanic guy"" (his words) -- was his ""partner."" Does that mean they wait tables together or something more? Hmmm. Not that there's anything wrong with that. But why did we need to know? I had the Sole Milanese, which was a lightly breaded and pan-fried fillet topped with arugula, fennel, parmesan, oranges, onions, and olives. There was such a mountain of salad atop the fish that I at first thought they had forgotten it. But it tasted very good and the portion size was nice. I was able to finish it all and feel full, but not completely puffed. My date had the chicken that was supposedly ""cooked under a brick"" (whatever that means) and she seemed to enjoy it enough, though she later remarked that it was a touch dry. The accompanying potatoes were good, however, and they had a nice spice to them. We passed on dessert and instead headed across the street to Emack & Bolios for ice cream. Yum.

This place reminded me of a Paris bistro. It was a gorgeous evening on the upper West side and with the doors open and outdoor patio seating, the vibe was a perfect complement to the night. The cuisine is French and flawlessly executed. You can choose to have the $35 prix fixe or go a la carte. There are a bunch of tempting options to select from. The prix fixe is a steal and we did our best to take advantage of that sweet deal. We started with stuffed artichokes and a frisee salad with Gorgonzola, bosc pears and candied walnuts. Both were very good and the salad was huge. Entrees for the table were the short rib ravioli, the Tuscan chicken cooked under a brick, the grilled salmon and the rack of lamb. Everything looked great and my sister and my brother in law make quick work of their dishes. My wife's salmon was a tasty fillet and paired with grilled asparagus. My rack of lamb was good and bloody and had a nice mustardy kick that was excellent. I was unsure about getting it. But, I was glad that I did. We also shared an order of pomme frites, which were somewhat disappointing. Nothing wrong with them at all, just not as good as others I've had. We finished with a tasty little bread pudding. Our meal was great. They also had fantastic bread baskets that they kept refilling all night. Service was spot on. They made simple work of the task of serving the rather cramped areas.

Now I absolutely love a good burger so of course I order one, the French fries were decent but the burger was disgusting, I'm not sure who taught the chef how to make aiola sauce but mine lacked even a hint of garlic it was all grease to include a flimsy wilted piece of red lettuce/cabbage. I requested a cup of mint tea and the waiter Jeremy brought over this cute little tea kettle alongside a cup that was filthy and had a coffee ring around the inside, the plate of which this dirty cup sat upon had a coffee stain  as well as a few leftover coffee grounds on it. I guess Jeremy expected me to stir the scalding hot tea with my finger as I wasn't given a spoon. I then requested a Pepsi and was told they had coke, I had to literally coax the rest of the soda selection out of Jeremy as if he was a scared bird leaving the nest for the first time. During my 20 min wait for the soda I finished most of my fries ( I only took 3 bites of that thing they called a burger), the runner comes to pick up the plates. After waiting and dying of thirst here comes our waiter Jeremy not with the soda I requested 20 mins ago but with the check. When I inquired as to the whereabouts of my soda he said oh i forgot, I told him it really didn't  make a difference at this point as the runner took our plates away about 10 mins ago. My friend didn't mind the French Toast though the portions were meager and for the price of $15 didn't include a sausage or even a sliver of bacon. To top it all off when I got home I was immediately nausea and spent the night in the bathroom, weird but my friend had the same experience. I DO NOT recommend this place to anyone at all.

As of 4/18/10 there is scaffolding on the building and all the outdoor seating is covered. Then our waiter was a mess. He took our drink order...and 10 minutes later came back with the cappuccino. He took our order but informed us that the ""brunch basket"" was gone for the day (a mix of scone, croissant and chocolate croissant)...so we ordered entrees without a starter. Then two minutes before our entrees came, so did a brunch basket. Apparently they found one more in the back. Only problem was...too much food at once. The idea of a ""starter"" was ruined. The food came and he brought a wrong entree. When informed that we ordered a Spicy Lamb Scramble but they brought something involving smoked salmon he proceeded to say that it was Lamb...clearly not paying attention. When he figured his life out, he brought the right entree. After this he pretty much left us alone...too long. Had to track him down for the check. When he brought it, it had three entrees on it...including the salmon mistake. He took the bill back and then the manager came out with the right one. After tracking HIM down to pay, the mess of a waiter came out with a check...not knowing that the manager had already come by. Tragedy. Too bad that my first time here may actually be my last.

The problem with most places is they feel compelled to cook the salmon (in some cases to the point where it is a hard piece of I-don't-know-what --- OSSO BUCO!!!!). Here, however, let the heat of the egg transfer to the salmon, which made it perrrrrfect!  It came with a salad that was perfectly coated with a delicious dressing.

5.0,2/17/2010,"My 5 star review of this place is inspired simply by a few brunch experiences. I know that's a lot of the menu left unexplored, but my money has been well-spent here. Although my first recommendation to anyone venturing to this spot would be the 5 Napkin burger, I've definitely deviated from that selection myself a few times. And to no disappointment. My other recommendation would be for the steak and eggs. The steak, though tender and delicious, almost falls behind the beautiful Bearnaise sauce that comes with it. Rewinding just a bit, I have to mention the bread selection - when you sit down, you're brought the most delicious basket of breads. The array within is so tasty it can be dangerous - it's easy to fill up on this, leaving you wishing you'd saved more room for your meal. The one point in this restaurant that I'm not thrilled about has been the service. I've actually had a few sour waitresses, who have been a bit snooty and even ignored me. Though for the most part, it has been fine - and the food itself is so excellent, that it make up for a few minor slips in service.",0,0,0,Tom F.,"Hastings-on-Hudson, NY",17,125,5

The outdoor seating looked nice, but we were told we would have to wait 30-45 minutest, and the clock would start when all seven of our party were on premises. The hostess was firm, but not snooty, just trying to maximize her table turn, I suppose. We were seated inside, but at a large open window the size of a huge sliding door. Turned out the people on the sidewalk were getting toasted, while we got the view of 79th and Amsterdam, but were in the shade. On to the food. Very nice waiter, obviously new to NYC. He took our drink and brunch order, then about 10 minutes later, came to apologize that due to the local liquor laws, we would not be served our drinks until after 12 noon! (It was then, 11:20 AM). We noshed on bread and ice water, and the waiter kindly held our order until about 11:50 AM. So drinks arrived about 12:15, food just a few moments later. So get to the food review, already!?#! I ordered Salmon Benedict, which took the classic Eggs Benedict and replaced the Canadian Bacon with nicely sliced lox. It was a hit. One of my table mates is vegan, so she ordered a lovely soup, made from pesto, vegetable broth, leeks and full of white beans. It was wonderful. Portion sizes are good, prices are modest for upper West Side in Manhattan, and the atmosphere is open and a little bit fun, as the interior design is slightly whimsical with bright colors and circus-y huge white chandeliers.Best of all, we hung out a total of nearly 2 hours and never got the evil eye to beat it. My only complaint was that the ""mango mimosa"" had not the least taste or fragrance of mango in it. We watched our drinks being made at the bar, but I have to say, skip it if you want a fruity drink. Next time, I'd just order a glass of Prosecco.

We shared the goat cheese tart with caramelized onions as an appetizer. I think we both wanted more and would've forgone our entrees for more tarts. Next he had the Five Napkin Burger which should be noted does not come with five napkins. And it should. It should really come with a lobster bib due to the mess. I had the butternut squash ravioli in kind of a soupy broth and the cheese was lacking, which made me wish it was just Italian style.

We had searched online for a restaurant and found ourselves here due to the yummy sounding menu and the fair price on the prix fixe T-Day dinner.The dinner was $40pp for an appetizer, entree, and dessert. And I wish I had written this review right after we went because I can't remember exactly what we each ordered. (doh!)My mom had their traditional turkey dinner for her entree. I had the rissotto for my app and the lamb entree. We each had something cholatey for dessert.Everything was pretty good. My mom's dinner was delicious from the few bites I tried. The turkey as I remember was cooked well and the side dishes were very good. My rissotto was a crab rissotto, or lobster, or something like. Except that it didn't have very much whatever was supposed to be in it. But other than the missing main ingredient, it was quite good. My lamb dish was really, really, really good. I don't remember everything that came on it, but I just remember enjoying it very much. I had a glass of Viognier with my meal that was very nice. Desserts were AH-mazing. Well, at least mine was. My mom's wasn't all that great. It was good, but nothing spectacular. Mine on the other hand was super delicious. It was very rich and chocolately and oh so scrumptuous. The port that we had to accompany our desserts was just the right touch.Our service was good. Not fantastic or over the top, but not lacking in any way. The only thing that was kind of annoying was when we asked the sommelier to tell us about the different ports they had and to help recommend something, he didn't seem very anxious to help or very friendly. He just kind of went through the motions. I bet he could have sold us a more expensive glass if he had tried...oh well.Over all it was good. It wasn't amazing, but it was a nice evening.

4.0,1/6/2009,"Post from my blog.  alexeatsworld.comIf brunch is your meal, New York is your city. The only problem is, I can't ever seem to get up, sober, before noon on Sundays in order to beat the rush. Based on the lines, seems like the rest of NY has the same problem. No matter, good food is worth the wait and Nice Matin was great.Located in the upper west side, Nice Matin is situated in a beautiful neighborhood away from the hustle and bustle of New York City. Here you'll see families pushing their babies in strollers and walking their dogs. I took advantage of the 30min wait and promptly proceeded to find two more restaurants to add to my list.Once seated, our meal started with their complementary bread basket. This was no ordinary bread basket; it had moist mini-muffins, croissants and raisin bread among others. If this was the only thing Nice Matin served, I still could have written a full Yelp review and given it 5 stars.The poached egg provencal was served with two eggs over a bed of ratatouille in a crisp pastry puff with tomato-cream sauce. If Thomas Keller of French Laundry was really the inspiration for the movie Ratatouille, this dish could spawn an epic 3-movie trilogy. Perfectly poached eggs poured its golden nectar over my ratatouille and the tomato sauce had the perfect amount of acid to pair with the yolk. No matter where I looked, the pasty puff was perfectly crisp and flaky.My friend got the creamy parmesan polenta which was a beautifully presented plate. Unfortunately, I'm not a fan of polenta but my friend swore it was good. Per its namesake, this polenta was creamier than it usually is.It's hard to come back to the same restaurant in NY because there's always the next one to try, but the food and unique brunch menu make this a tempting repeat.  Bravo Nice Matin.  Bravo.",0,0,1,Alex C.,"San Francisco, CA",108,168,243

4.0,1/4/2009,"I had a pretty great New Year's Day brunch at Nice/Matin.  While they were busy, the staff was surprisingly chipper (as I would probably not have been had I had to work the day after New Year's Eve) and the overall service was very attentive.  I never had to wait to have my water glass refilled, for instance, which came in so handy as I attempted to eat and drink my hangover away (um, it sort of worked.)  While maybe I should have had a cocktail (they looked terrific, somehow), I instead opted to have a cappuccino because I saw one being made.  They are made like little pieces of delicious individual art here, and being the coffee freak I am,  I can ALWAYS appreciate that!  I also eyed a mocha being made, and it was served in a huge mug (love it!) and again, it was served beautifully.  Then came the food!  The bread basket was filled with delicious pastries and breads, which were quite obviously homemade.  They were served with homemade orange marmalade to boot--a winning combination that I wish I could eat anytime.  I had the leek and asparagus frittata, which was chock-full of veggies and served with what seemed like extremely fresh ricotta cheese on top.  It was delicious.  My companion had the salmon with poached eggs, and it seemed seriously good as well (I don't eat fish, so I'll never know for sure..)  The atmosphere was decent, though I didn't feel like I had been transported to Nice despite all of the European guests there at the time.  (Though in fairness, it IS the dead of winter in NYC after all.  I hear they have really nice outdoor seating in summer.)  Overall, this was quite a decent brunch for the price, and I'd happily go again anytime.",0,0,0,Joolz M.,"Brooklyn, NY",123,219,38

3.0,12/19/2008,"""Oh yay, a fun little cocktail list!""  I thought after first looking at the menu online when the hubby said he was taking me here.  I always appreciate a place that serves a few well-made drinks.  If only that was the case here.My Cote D'Azur (supposedly Silver Tequila, St. Germain, ginger, grapefruit and fresh lime) tasted like a cheap margarita - no evidence whatsoever of the middle three ingredients.  Hubby's Dark and Stormy was even worse -- it was CLEAR.  Look, I know some people may use light rum for these, but it's always in addition to, NOT in lieu of, the dark!  I also had serious doubts about whether ginger beer (vs. ginger ale -- not kidding) was used.  And no actual ginger.  The one bright note was the Nice Royale, which came with gin, fresh peach, sage, lemon and bubbly.  Good thing, because if the french restaurant had f-ed up a champagne cocktail, we'd have really been in trouble :-)Sadly, I've concluded that I can't just go around town ordering cocktails, even in most ""nice"" restaurants, because I set myself up for disappointment given my standards (although really, can't a girl count on a dark and stormy to be DARK)?!Tabling my booze issues, the food was a mixed bag, ranging from mediocre to excellent.  The highlight of my meal was the tuna tartar appy (fantastic), and hubby's vegetable soup was savory and hearty as well.  Entree-wise, he went with the five-napkin burger.  If you order this, be prepared to get in there with the knife and the fork.  The burger, though cooked well, was  too thick, making it difficult to get a perfect, balanced bite -- it was tough to pile in any toppings or bread with a huge mouthful of meat.  I had beef short ribs.  A large serving and decent, but nothing special.  I should have gone with the duck, which looked tasty.We were too stuffed for dessert, but they looked yummy, and service was friendly / attentive all night.  I'd come back for a (champagne) cocktail and something chocolate-y, but any more of the disappointing other drinks would cause me to get all dark and stormy myself!  No one wants ""kreyge"" unleashed on the city.",6,5,6,Kathleen R.,"Manhattan, NY",465,215,152

The menu made a good attempt at being ""Nicois"" and did as well as one could expect at a hopping lunch joint on the Upper West Side. I started with a pistou vegetable soup. It was very tasty with the vegetables cooked right (not too mushy) and a nice strong basil and garlic flavor. Next came a crabmeat salad. Very generous portion but no dressing in sight. I had to ask for oil and vinegar. The flatbread pizza report was very positive from others at the table. C complained that his Croque-Madame had the wrong texture, my Martini wasn't very dirty and I didn't like the bare light bulbs trying to imitate some sort of French Ferris wheel décor.

4.0,8/21/2008,"Why I love this place: sitting at a small table drinking Schneider Edel-Weisse (ON TAP) I was asked if I could to please move tables. I said, sure, for another beer. They found it humorous, and moved me four-feet from my favorite living classical-violinist (CHRISTIAN TETZLAFF). I couldn't enjoy the rest of my evening, I was starstruck... The next evening he was performing Berg's Violin Concerto at Carnegie Hall!... This place is very comfortable and frequented by many people just looking for good food without much fuss... They have truly surprising rotating beer availability on tap. And many bottle available at low comparitive cost, which they're all too willing to give ""the royal treatment.""... My favorite menu items are (SOUP) Pistou (with bread and butter, it's a wonderful meal in itself). (SALAD) frisee with roquefort and pears and walnuts; tuna nicoise (perfectly prepared tuna, perfect veg, perfect egg, perfect crutons, perfect dressing, and an overall HUGE portion). (ENTREE) golden snapper (with amazing broccoli rabe and amazing romesco sauce); Ratatouille; Bouillabasse. The desserts are special but constantly changing and I'm usually too full to actually appreciate anything else... There are a few environments within the restaurant. It's a rather grand spectacle packed into such a small space... The service is good but I feel as if it's constantly changing and ""learning""...

I decided to come here on a beautiful summer Wednesday afternoon to read a magazine and relax at a nice corner bistro al fresco, if you will. I relaxed and the food was delicious, but the service was noticibly bad and i wasn't paying much attention--THAT is how bad it was. Bistro Foul #1: I ordered spring water and the busser poured TAP into my glass with the water I had purchased. Bistro Foul #2: Don't bring out my wine 20 minutes after I order it. Its 2pm on a Wednesday afternoon--you're not busy enough to get this wrongBistro Foul #3: No baguettes in the bread basket--seriously?! Bistro Foul #4: The waitress that was trying to mimic Houdini in her ability to disappear for periods of time that were unparrrelled to Houdini himself. Come back! Bistro Foul #5: I would have ordered dessert...if she gave me that option and even presented a dessert menu.. I know you have it. I've seen it before. I actually adore your deserts, but apparently you don't because YOU'RE NOT SHARING THEM WITH ME.The frisse salad with Roquefort is divine, the half bottle of Riesling is perfection, and the french fries with sprinklings of spices--magnificent.

1.0,8/9/2008,"Went to Nice Matin for brunch today with 3 friends. Disappointing to say the least. Restaurant was hot, service was poor (ie: no drink refills), and the food was less than mediocre. My eggs were not cooked and on top of that, there was a grub that was at least 3/4"" long that was wriggling in my salad. When I pointed it out to my waitress, she asked me if I found it in my food. DUH! I was beyond disgusted. The waitress took the plate over to the manager who proceeded to come over to our table and tell us that she didn't see the grub but she would take the meal off our ticket. She apologized but was clearly disingenuous and told me it was because they used ""organic"" produce and sometimes that happens.I will never step foot in that restaurant again.

3.0,7/27/2008,"Let me start by saying this is the second brunch spot to dissapoint me this month.  They started out strong, menu looked interesting.. we were promptly brought water and a bread basket.  And by bread basket I mean basket of delicious.  Some carrot-cake type muffins, croissant, and tasty wheat bread.  I'd 5-star the bread basket, if I could seperately write reviews for bread baskets.  But I can't.From here on it was fairly downhill.  Each of our sandwiches was served with mixed greens and hash brown.  To be frank, I was confused with the hash brown & croque monsieur pairing they decided to go with.  We asked the waiter what the sandwiches came with and his best description was 'some greens and some potato.. see over there (pointing 30 ft away) like that'.  Helpful.  Mind you, the hash brown was good, just not something I would expect to be served at a french bistro, or with the type of sandwiches we ordered.  Oh and it took about 30-40 minutes for us to get our sandwiches, which didn't help.  Spent half the meal waiting for food and flagging down someone to refill our waters.Overall the food was good, the service fairly weak.  For French bistro food, you have other options in the UWS, and I would probably go with them.  French Roast, just a short 6 block walk up Broadway, is vastly superior.. and cheaper.  I was dissapointed also knowing that Nice Matin is run by a group which runs French Roast and Maison, both of which I liked much more.  Nice Matin certainly looks fancier, and maybe thats what you are paying for here, I'm not really sure.",1,0,1,Steve H.,"New York, NY",4,26,0

I rarely find French restaurants that I like, and I wasn't in the mood for French at all. So, I was about as unexcited as one can be to eat here.Trooper that I am, I decided I was going to enjoy a nice martini for breakfast (first meal of the day is breakfast regardless of time) and make the best out of my experience. We got seated right away outside. They let us pick our table - which was nice. Then... the service disappeared. I mean nothing! No one came up to us to give us our menus, or take our drink orders or anything of the sort! 10 minutes later my companion flags down a water boy who fetches us a peeved looking waiter. We ignore his snottiness and raise him one by ordering drinks in a snottier tone then the one we were greeted with.Awesome. That did the trick. The drinks came quickly, accompanied by a large smile.We had the tuna tartar appetizer which was ok. They went a little acid happy on it. I ordered the lamb dish rare but it came out closer to medium. The veggies it was served on were fresh and delicious and so was the feta. It would have been better if the bottom of the dish wasn't filled with olive oil. I wanted to cut my lamb and ended up having to do it on a bread plate to avoid soaking it in oil.

3.0,8/12/2007,"This place, while nothing all that special, had a pretty decent breakfast.  I had the egg white frittata with spinach and mushrooms and, while a little bland, was decent enough considering egg white frittatas are often plain, horrible, and not the right consistency.  This one got it right and just needed some salt and pepper to get it going (though it could have been a little less buttery).  They had this wonderful whole grain toast and their jam and marmalade was delicious.  The coffee was not very good and the decor is kind of bland - from the sign for some reason I expected it to be kind of sleek and modern and it just looked like a generic french cafe on the inside.  I wouldn't seek Nice Matin out but if I were on the upper west side I might go there for breakfast again.  Nothing special but totally decent enough.  I wasn't disappointed by anything but I certainly wasn't wowed either.",0,0,0,Dottie D.,"West Los Angeles, CA",34,142,0
3.0,8/6/2007,"Went to meet a friend for brunch here. I like the fact you can sit outside and watch the world go by with a bloody mary.  Plus if you are wearing sunglasses it makes it so much easier to stare at others. I ordered the omelet that had goat cheese in it and thought it was fairly good.  They also bring you a small basket of bread to keep you satisfied until your food arrives.  I didn't get the impression they were that expensive.  I had my omelet, 3 bloody mary's and proceeded home happy and slightly drunk! Ahhh what a way to start a Saturday!",3,0,1,Karen J.,"New York, NY",30,201,0

1.0,7/31/2007,"We requested outdoor seating, and she stuck us at a corner table behind a bush when there was tons of great seating around the corner.  Then our waiter interrupted my husband in the middle of a question so that he could give silverware to the table next to us.  He then didn't return for ten minutes.  The whole experience was one of being snubbed, so we said screw it and got up and left to go elsewhere (Bettola a few doors down on Amsterdam, which was excellent).We didn't end up eating here, so I can't comment on the food.",2,0,2,Emily B.,"Portland, OR",57,61,8
3.0,7/20/2007,"Went here once for brunch and once for dinner during restaurant week.  The food was good but not stellar.  I would recommend it more for brunch than dinner.  The dinner platters were good, but didn't have either the flavor or the pazzazz to warrant more stars.  The bread didn't taste so fresh, the risotto was a little undercooked, and the fish was so-so.  The desserts were quite good, though.",0,0,0,David X.,"New York, NY",10,121,0
4.0,6/30/2007,"my fave place to go for pretty good french food on the upper west side.  try the five-napkin burger, it will not disappoint.  their seven grain bread is excellent (they apparently get it from a bakery in new jersey).  the steak au poivre and tuna nicoise salad are also quite good.",2,0,0,Angela K.,"New York, NY",3,80,0

4.0,6/10/2007,"This is certainly  nice place to go and eat brunch. It's certainly not the best place in new york, however, it is a rather nice place. I had an omelet that was pretty good, though a little on the bland side. I thought they could have used a few more herbs, but nonetheless, it was good. I also thought the potato's that came with it were quite tasty. I'm not sure if this is an NYC thing, but in most places, if you get an iced tea, they refill the drink when it is done. This was not the case here, but the tea was quite good, so I guess I just wish they had given me more of it.The reason this place gets a 4 instead of a 3 is because of the bread. They give you a very nice basket of fresh baked breads. The assortment was nice and quite good. Overall, I'd say it was a good choice, but probably not the best.",0,0,0,Erik S.,"San Francisco, CA",64,675,23
2.0,5/8/2007,"Average. If you are in the neighborhood and are with grandparents, seeking some rest from a long walk in central park - looking for a clean ""upscale"" experience with no surprises- its worth it. I would not make a special trip just to sample this cuisine or the ambience. The burger bun is pleasantly not of the brioche-ilk and arrives poured in comte cheese. It is good, not great. The steamed halibut is tasty as well as the bread. Service is eager.",2,1,1,Luca L.,"Narragansett, RI",23,163,3
3.0,5/7/2007,"I was staying at the Lucerne, which is as nice as the Kimpton hotels, so I naively assumed (or hoped) the food here would be Kimpton Hotel Group restaurant quality.  Now, the qualifications of the chef at Nice Matin are very impressive and I thought it would be analogous to Kimpton's whole chef-driven restaurant schtick, so overall my expectations were reasonable.I ordered the Steak Frites, which isn't even a hugely difficult or hard dish.  The fries were soggy and underseasoned (and boringly presented), but the steak was perfectly cooked, just nothing special.  The hangar steak at Poste Moderne Brasserie in DC is soooo much better.Anyhow, it was ok.  It wasn't great, but it was ok.  For the kind of money I spent the food wasn't spectacular, and there definitely wasn't anything exciting or innovative happening on the menu.  I definitely got the sense this was a see and be seen kind of place.  I'd rather go elsewhere.",1,0,1,Michelle W.,"Reston, VA",109,170,6
3.0,5/6/2007,"OVERpriced...This place woos those who have mediocre tastebuds with money to burn. Maybe it's a place for stuffy yuppies to be seen after work. Who knows? The long wait does not make up for the average service. The food was nowhere near ingenious, and it's saving grace is the outdoor seating where you can enjoy watching those without pass by wistfully.",0,0,0,BrasilPo P.,"Oakland, CA",99,515,833
3.0,4/12/2007,"Nice Matin is an Upper West Side staple for the NYC institution that is Sunday Brunch. Although they don't take reservations, and it was Easter Sunday, we only had to wait 15 minutes for a table. But it was definitely very busy. They have a complimentary coat check which is handy given the relatively tight seating. However, the server and waitress didn't offer to take our coats (hrmph).Overall, the food is nothing to write home about. The starter basket of sweet bread, mini muffins, croissant, and confiture (jams) was a nice assortment, albeit a little cold and hard. Excellent fresh squeezed orange juice. For a French brasserie, I would expect them to use brioche for the Orange-Buttermilk French Toast. Instead, there were two sad pieces of a bread loaf. Not cool. Especially for $11. Did they get the maple syrup from an endangered species of tree?  Also, the Parmasean Polenta with fried eggs, swiss chard, and pancetta was fine for the first several bites and inedible by the end. The eggs were overdone (though I had specifically asked for it to be cooked over medium), and the swiss chard was like eating chewy charcoal. The polenta had potential, but I think they went overboard w/ the parmasean, thus making it quite salty. Since there are so many other places on the UWS to check out for brunch (with great brunch specials too), I don't think I'll be heading back to Nice Matin for brunch anytime soon. Perhaps I'll give it another try for lunch during the summer time, when there are tables out on the sidewalk , bringing a European vibe to the place.",6,3,6,Steph P.,"Saint Paul, MN",264,290,146
4.0,11/8/2006,"Nice Matin makes a nice upscale French meal - probably not the most memorable thing you've ever had, but the ambiance and the service make it worth a trip. In good weather, sitting outside on Amsterdam can make for a very leisurely and pleasant evening. I've had a few salads here that were outstanding - I think one was a Mediterranean style salad with lamb. I think this is a nice place to take out of town guests (especially of the parental variety) because of the service, cool lighting, and fun atmosphere.",1,0,1,Maggie M.,"Austin, TX",18,41,0

The portions were perfect, the staff was friendly but the wait was a little long. The neighborhood it is located in is a very cute one, so sitting outside makes it worth it. If you do end up going, try the warm chocolate cake at the end. It is so good it will leave you wanting more. It's an elegant restaurant, but the attire is casual.

3.0,4/15/2006,"Had Sunday brunch here with a friend and it was just a madhouse!  We slaked our thirst with excellent bloody marys until we were seated.  The food had delicious flavors, but everything was just a little too rich.  Ordered the Roasted Beet & Haricot Vert salad.  Good, but the freshness of it was diminished by the excessive olive oil.  For our mains, we ordered the Parmesan Polenta and the Kobe Beef chopsteak.  Again, delicious, but we were full after a few bites.  Too much of a good thing.... The service was friendly enough, but bordered on stiff.  Same goes for the rest of the clientele.",0,0,0,Emily L.,"New York, NY",58,137,1
3.0,2/14/2006,"This is not a destination restaurant.  It's a good place to eat, if you're in the neighborhood. For Nice Matin (""morning in Nice"") to call itself a French restaurant is a huge stretch.  Tthis is more like a standard restaurant that happens to have maybe 30% French dishes on the menu.  Few of the staff speak French, even a little bit. Supposedly it's allied with several other French restaurants around town including Le Monde, on Broadway up by Columbia, Le Marseile on the West Side theater district, both of which are much more Francois in every way.  But, other than the post card, I don't see much with Nice-Matin in common with these two much-more-Francois bistros. It's nice.
