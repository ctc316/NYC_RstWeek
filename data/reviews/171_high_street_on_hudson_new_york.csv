5.0,4/27/2019,"If one judges a restaurant by the bread it serves, High Street gets a five-star from the get go. We dicided to come back here because of the new Master Chef Mary, and we are so glad that we did. We came as a family of five on a Friday night, reservation of course. We shared all our dishes. I saw Whitsle Pig Eye on the drink list and wanted to give it a try out of curiosity, which exactly matches the server's description. My favorite starter is Chicken Liver Mousse with cardamom, figs, pistachio, and anise, (and the tosted bread that comes with it); my favorite main course is Torched Mackerel with turnips, shiitakes, and dashi, which gives it a delicate taste. Warm greetings from Chef Mary makes it the high light of our evening. What a nice place to have dinner on a Friday night.",0,0,0,Y. C.,"Manhattan, NY",32,21,14

5.0,4/10/2019,"Stopped here for breakfast to treat my mom on her birthday. We ordered two sandwiches and split them. The bodega was delicious. The sausage is very thick and the biscuit is dense. The forager was amazing! I loved the mushroom and how delicately the milk bun held the sandwich together. My mom preferred the bodega and I preferred the forager.Definitely coming back for the pastries.

4.0,4/9/2019,"This was great, and the service was perfect. (It was less than perfect in our previous visit.)This time, we got the cinnamon cardamom roll, a spelt score, the Bodega, and the Jersey Girl. Both pastries were great -- we probably preferred the cinnamon roll, but we also didn't finish it because it was so heavy. We really liked both sandwiches as well -- both were also very heavy, and I think next time around I'd love to the bagel board and/or the high street leo.Anyway, really solid brunch spot and no wait at 11am on a Sunday, which seemed almost impossible for this neighborhood.",0,0,0,Shawn H.,"New York, NY",90,533,3087
3.0,4/8/2019,"Love the neighborhood, the food and the vibe. High Street is on tons of Eater's list for brunches and the girlfriends and I decided to try it out. The breakfast sandwiches are the best. I got the forager and someone else in the party got the bodega. Both eggcellent in their eggy way. The braised green was the highlight in the forager while they could be more generous with the mushroom, my side sausage made up. However, the service was seriously lacking from our server Haley P. She had no smiles and gave off a negative vibe the whole time we were there. When asked to put in an additional order of potatoes, she seemed bother. Did not bring a spoon for my friend's yogurt. We ended up asking the host to check on our food as we were not checked on ever. Our water carafe ran dried and was never replaced. Our bill was wrong. Additionally, I ordered a orange poppyseed almond cake to go and ask her to set it aside while we initially put in the order and she completely forgot. So I went up to the pastry/coffee section and ordered it myself. She saw me doing it and decided to ignore it. No apologies, nothing. Some people are not meant to be in hospitality. If you need a part time job and do not enjoy making other people feel welcomed and happy by your present, please reconsider being in the service industry.",1,1,1,Nancy N.,"New York, NY",358,165,409

5.0,3/31/2019,"Two things get five stars here and the rest get four:1. The cinnamon cardamom roll and2. The sesame kouge AmanI could eat these every day. Fluffy, perfectly frosted, delicately sweetened and rolled. Incredible. The sesame is more savory than the bun so I like to tell myself the combo makes a well-balanced breakfast. The sandwiches? They're alright. Four stars. I'm not a fan of the sausage in the egg sandwich and will swap it out for bacon next time (tastes like cheap, meaty McDonalds sausage). The farmers sandwich with kale and mushrooms is very good for a veggie sandwich, though the kale is pretty bitter.Comin' back for those pastries.5 stars!!!!!!",6,1,2,Bonnie G.,"New York, NY",171,592,1029

5.0,3/26/2019,"First off, lets have full disclosure. I HAVE NOT EATEN at High Street.I did eat at the restaurant at the Whitney which was wonderful. When I asked where they got their amazing bread, they directed me to High Street which is just around the corner. I purchased the most expensive bread of my life, $14 for generous sized  round loaf . It truly is the bread of dreams. If i could live on nothing but their bread, I'd be very poor but very happy. Not only did it taste amazing the day of purchase, the last crumbs almost a week later we just as tasty.  If you look at my other reviews, you'll see i don't hand out comments like this often. My suggestion, stop what you're doing and go there. If the food coming out of the kitchen is even half as good, you're in for a amazing meal. And don't forget to buy a loaf of bread to take home.",1,1,0,Arnie A.,"Bronx, NY",0,23,72

4.0,3/12/2019,"Arrived here on a Saturday morning with no reservation for brunch. Luckily only a twenty minute wait for a party of two, which they take your number down and text when the table is about ready. Fairly cozy inside, with a portion dedicated for to-go coffee orders. Lots of good options on the menu which is slightly different from what shows on the website. Started off sharing the Spelt Scone ($4.50) - a dense baked item topped off by a sweet pear marmalade. Would be heavy for one person, but easy to finish off with two people. For the main course, opted for the Bodega Sandwich ($16) and beer ($9). The Bodega is another hefty offering of eggs, cheese, sausage and gravy inside a buttered biscuit. Lots of flavor and certainly filling, could barely get to the side salad it comes with. Also tried the Old Bay Potatoes ($6) - which are giant cut fried wedges served with a garlic aioli. Felt the potatoes were a bit undercooked, so couldn't finish any more than half the offering.Service is quick and they offered hot sauce without asking. More on the expensive side for the first meal of the day; worth going for the sandwich however.",0,0,0,Shaji K.,"Queens, NY",289,1569,1552

My party of three enjoyed our pastries from the bakery, while sipping fragrantly brewed coffee. And despite how packed the restaurant was, the overall volume was bearable, and the waiting staff worked seamlessly to attend to each table. We never felt ignored or rushed, and our food arrived rather promptly.I highly recommend the pear marmalade scone and cinnamon cardamom roll!

Savory and filling, the biscuit has a slight crunch on the outside but is soft and buttery on the inside, and the aioli sauce on it was a great touch (though I could have used half of what was on there).Also try the Old Bay Potatoes as a side or app. Just the right amount of crisp on the outside.The malted chai latte was good, though it wasn't much different than the plain chai latte so you can go that route if you want to save some sugar.The place is small so you might have a wait - but the cafe is open if you want something before you sit down - and the barista there gave us all the deets on what to order - helped a ton!",0,0,0,Chase P.,"Marietta, GA",162,52,42

We came here because the Restaurant Week menu was defiantly one of the best around. The oysters were fresh and came with a unique vinegar sauce. The bread and malted bread is incredible (I make my own bread so my standards for bread are high and it's delicious!) the panzanella is amazing with their bread, radishes, feta, and roasted Brussels. The pumpkin curry soup was super unique and good. I had the Whole Salted Bronzino which was HUGE and unbelievably moist and flavourful. The Salmon came tender with a creamy sauce. The mousse was like ice cream is was so smooth and rich. The service was great! Would come back for sure. It was a great experience all in all.",0,0,0,Daniel G.,"New York, NY",7,44,25

1.0,1/30/2019,"I had high hopes for High Street on Hudson. Sadly, they did not live up to it and we were INCREDIBLY disappointed. The room is nice. The food was good, (although a bit on the salty side.) However, the service was absolutely terrible. Simply awful. So many things went wrong, which I won't bore you with, but the main issue was the timing. We ordered our dinners at 7:45, and we were not served UNTIL 9:00PM!!! We waited 40 minutes to just get our appetizers and then another 35 minutes more for our dinners. There were 7 of us at dinner, and we talked to the manager, she apologized, and said they were backed up. (the restaurant was only half full!! Hate to see what it would be like on a busy night!) and then she said, ""I apologize. And I comped 4 drinks for you."" 4?? There are SEVEN of us here. Are only four of us upset? NO! Buy us a ALL a round of drinks, at least!There was no sense of urgency, or anything. Just a LOT of excuses. In the end, some other gentleman came to the table and spoke with us and offered to help us with the bill and comp some things. But at this point, it was too late. We were all irritated past the point of no return.Perhaps, it was just a bad night for them. Not sure. But for the seven of us, I assure you, we are never going back.

2.0,1/21/2019,"Overall, this is not a memorable place to eat. I most likely would not come back here. The food is edible but in no way something I'd ever crave. The most disappointing part of the menu is the lack of variety in food choices. Not vegetarian/vegan friendly or even really non-pork friendly ie it's mostly all ham/bacon. They didn't offer substitutions for these dishes. Other than the food, the service was fine and the interior was nice--not better than most other NYC cafes however",1,1,2,Maysa M.,"Mesa, AZ",25,175,56

3.0,12/25/2018,"I wanted to like High Street On Hudson a lot more than I actually did. Everything about the place screams, ""This is totally your kind of joint!"" From the casual/modern décor with the counter-height two tops right in the front window to the nouveau American offerings on the menu, even the plating and visual appeal of each dish was splendid.... It had all the right instrumentation, but couldn't hit that crucial right note.For starters, I found the croutons in our panzanella salad to be crunchy to the point of distraction. I could be wrong, but I thought panzanella bread was intended to be a bit on the crusty side, but soft enough to have some bite. Disappointingly, one needed to take care not to send shards of bread-shrapnel flying when forking into these. Otherwise, the salad boasted a beautiful blend of flavors and textures and would have been flawless.Similarly, the cumin crusted lamb offered a delectable marrying of sweet, spicy, sour, and savory. The portion was even generous, and we were pretty satisfied with sharing between two people. The miss here was how tough and gristly the lamb itself ended up being.I was drawn to High Street On Hudson based on its proximity to where we were (just wrapping up a visit to the nearby Apple store) and its mouthwatering photos on Yelp. Unfortunately, the version of food that entered my mouth did not live up to the hype of what my eyes had beheld.

4.0,12/23/2018,"This is one of the better brunch options in the Chelsea area. You'll never be in for a surprise here - it's classic brunch foods, decent service, and great lighting in the restaurant. Their menu isn't huge, which I love not having to parse through many different options. I've tried most items on their menu. Their bread is really good. Don't pass up on it or order toast on the side. Crust is sharp and the bread has great texture. It's always fresh. Some of my favorite brunch options - bodega sandwich is probably their most popular item. Their biscuit is great. Baked eggs are good but it's a strong mustard-y flavor. Their ""meat"" filled breakfast is popular amongst my guy friends. Their granola is good. Everything is good and classic. Portions aren't huge so if you're on a diet, this is the place for you.

However, the wine tasting soured the evening. My friend and I paid $35 each for which amounted to less than a glass per person. Yes, the wine was lovely and paired well with the food, but if you are shelling out $85 per person for dinner you would expect a little more than 1 oz of wine per pairing. They took the term *tasting* literally by only giving us each a taste. My advice is if you go just get a bottle.

I've both gotten takeout and sat down in here for brunch multiple times, and that is the only thing I will get. I've tried their hot sauce on the Bodega sandwich too but the combo just wasn't as good, though I also like the Bodega sandwich on its own. It can take a while to wait for your food (especially when it's busy, though I've had that issue too even when it was pretty empty) and I've also had times where my sandwich was a little too burned, but still come back time and time again for the Forager.",1,1,1,Zhenny G.,"Manhattan, NY",258,107,62

Servers were very nice, they attended to me quickly, the gazpacho soup and kale/grain salad was even pretty delicious. ""So what's with the two star review?"" You're possibly wondering...well:1. It was small portions2. Too expensive for aforementioned small portions3. BUT THE MOST DISAPPOINTING PART was the dirty and chipped bowl, plate, and utensils they made me eat out of! The soup bowl had 2 chips in it, the salad plate had one chip in it. The saucer that held the soup bowl had yellow food left overs smudged on it and the fork had food stuck in between the prongs. (See pics for details)For a place that's so highly regarded and that kind of tries to give off a classy dining experience I definitely expect more than to be eating off of broken and dirty serve ware. It's one of the most basic rules of working in a restaurant. C'mon guys, I really didn't expect this from you.

2.0,8/4/2018,"The whole experience was off. We were exploring all day so we came in around 3:30 for a late lunch. The place was not busy, but the service was fairly slow. We may have visited on an off day. Ultimately, I am frustrated with management. I've been in the industry for about 8 years, it is their job to have the proper menus and set the standard for their servers.After we sat, we were told there was a mid-day menu with about 7 items. I planned to order the Spicy Italian sandwich with a side salad, and my husband was planning on the turkey sandwich with a salad. When I ordered the waiter said ""oh we don't have the Italian sandwich, you have the wrong menu.""   We received two new menus and it has everything except the Italian sandwich. Therefore, my husband and I both ordered the turkey sandwich with side salads for $16. Our sandwiches come and it's only the sandwich. We expected the salad to come, but nothing showed up. I inquired with the waiter and he said, ""oh yeah, you noticed. Well the menu changed and we no longer serve the salads with the sandwiches."" The waiter said he'd ""see what I can do."" I was equally confused and annoyed. Nothing arrived.We asked for the check and we were given a dessert as a quote ""in place of the salad."" It was about the size of a golf ball and not that great.I could tell the waiter was overwhelmed and probably hands were tied due to all these changes and no course of action to fix the discrepancies with the menu. $67 for 2 sandwiches the size of a small fist, 1 cocktail, and 1 glass of wine.

Ambiance: This is definitely a step above your average neighborhood cafe. Big windows, feels pretty open. Service: meh, kind of average. Our first waitress was really sweet and bubbly but our second didn't seem too thrilled to be working. Our check took awhile to get at the end. They also don't do much for birthdays as I was sad to find out despite my informing the hostess before we sat down. Perhaps this was our fault since we didn't order a dessert but I guess a heads up would have been nice. Drinks: don't remember what I got but it was ok Food: I would 100% come back for the spaghetti. Al dente, a touch of spice, subtle smokiness from the tomatoes, the right amount of pecorino, and some breadcrumbs for crunch. Perfect palace of everything. We each got the $55 tasting menu. The liver mousse was good but not the best. Grilled fish was tasty but I was so full by the end. Second fave of the table was probably the fried broccoli.

The size of our sandwich was 50% of what we saw on images...but also the ladies next to us who ordered the same thing got a larger slab of sausage 3x as much) as well as more eggs (maybe 2x+), whereas our sausage was hard to find without lifting the biscuit to look hard for it (it was about 0.3-0.5cm in width vs theirs were about an inch thick) - basically it looked like we received two large slices of burnt biscuit rather than a sandwich.3. On top of the fact that we basically just got salty hard bread, they've also since increased the price from $13 to $15 (vs what I've seen on Yelp) - yet decreased the quantity, and possibly quality as well.I also wanted to try the meyer lemon cream puffs but they were also not around.All in all, not a huge fan of the food.

Here's the low-down:The food (specifically for dinner) was a lot smaller portions (and fancier/healthier) than I expected. For appetizers, we ordered bread and butter and Carrots a la Mendez. The bread and butter was $5 for four slices of bread and some ""unique"" butter, which seems a bit hefty for something that is normally complimentary at restaurants. The Carrots a la Mendez was steamed carrots with some sort of sauce (basically tasted like rabbit food). Needless to say, my guy friends were still starving at this point, but it's great for those of you who love carrots and are health conscious. For dinner, I ordered the Gnocchi with scallops which was actually very delicious and seasoned well. The portion was small, but it was a perfect size for me. One of my friends ordered the Cauliflower steak which was basically a giant steamed broccoli (or cauliflower?) with what looked like cauliflower rice on the side. My friends were not impressed with the food here. Overall, I thought the food here is very unique and different, but not necessarily in a good way.

The pickled vegetables provided a strong taste that I could do without, but was easy to set aside. 2) House made pasta: there is nothing better than fresh pasta. The tomatoes and sauce were impeccable and the hints of crunchy breadcrumbs mixed in provided a unique and welcome twist. 3) Cauliflower steak: wonderful mix of flavors. I looked down and ate this as if I were transported to a deliciously natural food eating contest (not cute on my part). High likelihood that I will return.

We came around noon and were seated even though it was prime Sunday brunch time.When we left around 1:30pm though, there was quite the line - so come early if you can!We got the Bodega sandwich (a fancy sausage & egg sandwich), the Forager sandwich (a tasty and cheesy vegetarian option), and the Meat Packer Plate (a HUGE way to get your morning started). Oh and because we are hardcore carb-lovers, we also got the Toast Board. Everything was super tasty and I honestly can't complain. The Bodega and Forager sandwiches look a little small but they're actually such delicious whompers! The Bodega is the fanciest, highest quality sausage and egg sandwich you'll encounter. You really can't go wrong with it. The Forager's mushroomy center was juicy and flavorful - all covered in a generous amount of swiss. As tasty as it was, it got a little too rich for me and I wanted a bit more dimension to the sandwich. My friend's Meat Pack Plate was amazingly big. I couldn't believe it when the waiter showed up with a really filled plate of eggs + meat and then a generous bowl of potatoes on top of it. And I gotta say, the potatoes were BOMB! Wonderfully crispy, perfectly cooked inside - and seasoned just right with enough Old Bay. It's a hard balance, but High Street has done it! As full as I was, I definitely made room for the Toast Plate because the breads here are amazingggggg. That magical crunchy crackle and crisp of the exterior, contrasted with the tender center = heavenly! Honestly, I don't think you can go wrong with anything on the menu.

I've had Oysters at literally hundreds of places, and no restaurant has ever applied a topping on them prior to serving them. The skate with tiny clams ($28) was delicious but the Torchetti Pasta with duck ragu ($23) was overpriced and was a small portion. I've never understood why a Chef can't cook a 1/3 to a half pound of dry pasta and give a guest a decent portion.

Its a cute, little restaurant in the west village serving contemporary, American cuisine. The menu is seasonal (which I love) so i'll have to go back to see how it changes. The interior is sleek and modern and the staff is extremely friendly and welcoming. There's an open kitchen in the back of the restaurant where you can see the chefs work their magic. It was relatively empty on the night that I went which is surprising because of how great this place is. High Street serves creative craft cocktails and has an extensive wine list. We didn't get any appetizers but i ordered the Chicken in the Woods entree. It's half a chicken with mushrooms, tuscan kale and a jus that you get to pour all over the top. The chicken was perfectly cooked and the mushrooms with kale were delicious. Its the all around perfect dish and the jus sets it over the top. For dessert, we ordered a honey custard that's topped with honeycomb candy, ricotta mousse and cranberries. This dessert sounds simple but it has some incredible flavor. It was sweet but not too sweet, and had so many great textures throughout.

I walked up to the counter, the ginger scone looked okay and the muffin was tempting but the goddess of prompt dessert abandoned us.     I think the wait staff gets saddled with too much delivery and too little waiting.  Poor things were running back and forth between the kitchen trying to keep the hot things hot.  No wait staff around so I dumped cash on the check so I didn't have to wait for the pick up.  When I do that, that is my signal that things are bit slow.",0,0,0,David S.,"Arlington, VA",0,61,0

Picture a crowded Starbucks at 830am. But this is dinner, West Village, Sat evening, 715.Our 4 top had two chairs against the wall, two facing in. The two super uncomfortable outside chairs were bumped into literally every time the many badly trained, glib and yet chaotic waitstaff passed us by.We ordered the prix fix 3 courser, which sounded nice and autumnal. Now I know why it was reduced to 50 dollars a piece. We arrived at 715, and ordered by 730. It took 30 minutes for our first course, (mine-an  unattractive pile of skimpy carrot shards strewn accross 1/2 a saucer sized plate of cheese and oil, masquerading as a starter) to show up.It took an entire 5 minutes, respectively, the 4 of us to finish the apps.We jumped back into our larynx damaging conversation, so painfull really, over the din, (with not a sound absorbant inch in the place) that my ears are still ringing 4 hours later. 45 minutes later, we realized that still had not recieved aour second courses, we started to think they'd forgotten our order.We hailed the waiter, who sort of giggled when we reminded him how long we'd been sitting unfed, now over 45 minutes, but he never apologized.  He just said it's coming. Tick tick tick tock...10 more minutes and we got the manager's attention.  We gave him the 411, and he told us, ""Your meal is being plated, we are really backed up"".  No offer of drinks. No intelligent heartfelt contrition, just excuses, which as every business owner/runner in the world SHOULD KNOW, are not what a disatisfied customer wants to hear. Another 10 minutes of waiting made it clear that nobody had ""plated"", our food, so it was bye bye bad restau! The 4 of us were just done, so we stood up, I asked for the check. Miraculously, as if he'd thiught nothing of the situation, the guy seemed surprised, or maybe he was high, or just so out of touch with the reality that there are literally, 10,000 other restaurants in Manhattan where we'd rather be. He statred to take my credit card, suddenly thiught better of it, and decided that he would not let us pay....he even appologized, asked if there was anything he could do (what a great time for me to have burst into a song and dance with, ""Too Little Too Late"", but I said ""no thank you"", and the 4 of us bolted.Nightmare.Never. Ever. Again!PS: When we'd had a similar experience a few years back at another W Village restaurant (who simply could not get their serving act together), the manager, upon hearing the 411, came over to our table and comped us all, 10 of us, an entire 3 course meal, plus 20 cocktails, was gracious beyond words, made zero excuses, was charming, apologetic, and thusly, we have returned to that restarant many times!",0,0,0,Lisa C.,"New York, NY",0,33,0

Our original server returned with our drinks and also tried to sell the chefs menu and admitted he had not put our appetizer order in yet. We declined, again. Our appetizers took maybe half an hour to arrive (which included bread and olives!), followed by a grilled octopus dish that the maitre'd literally pointed to in their open kitchen, but did not arrive at our table for at least another 15-20 minutes. Then we waited and waited for our entrees, asking several times about their status. They finally brought us an extra appetizer, only a few minutes before our entrees finally arrived (so kind of pointless, and just making more work for the kitchen). In all, it was approximately two hours after we sat down that our entrees arrived. They were ok for the most part, or we were so hungry that it didn't matter. One of my friends felt that the duck ragu was definitely subpar, with very little meat and far too much radicchio.

1.0,9/10/2017,"I understand brunch is a veritable throwaway for a restaurant - food is not fresh, servers hate being there, but as long as I am paying customer, I expect the same service and quality of food as any other time of the day.  SERVICE WAS ATROCIOUS, INEXCUSABLE and completely without a sense of care or responsibility, from the chatty but useless waiter to the contrite but USELESS manager, both of whom blamed the kitchen, naturally, while everyone's orders kept on coming despite their finger pointing. Who trains these people??? No one, obviously.  Pathetic amateurs. Can't comment on the food because we walked out.",0,1,0,dennis c.,"Queens, NY",0,12,0
4.0,9/10/2017,"Came here for brunch today after hearing so many good things, and it lived up to expectations! I've been to Fork for dinner and High Street on Market for a pastry, both in Philly, and was excited to try this new location! We started with the coffee date cake - split opinions on this among the table, where I thought it was pretty good, and even great as a shared starter, but this ended up being the most tepid take. Get a pastry to start! They bake their bread and pastries in-house and have really interesting flavors (chocolate chai Sammy?). Our waiter also recommended the almond chocolate croissant, though he said this was pretty heavy, so if you're a croissant person, definitely try. I got the Forager sandwich, which is their vegetarian option with oyster mushroom, house-baked kaiser, kale, mustard / aioli. The sandwich was amazing - the mushrooms were the perfect thickness and were cooked perfectly, super flavorful. The pairing with kale worked really well for the texture, and the eggs were soft scrambled without being too soft, the way I really like them. The roll was super fluffy, not too buttery, and absorbed the sauce and egg flavors well. As a heads up, the sandwiches generally look pretty small in size at first (though the pastrami hash is especially hefty - definitely needs some fork and knife intervention), but they're really filling. On a separate note, Bon Appetit has the recipe for the Forager sandwich through a collaboration with the chef, which was fun to read! Overall, loved High Street and would definitely come back. The sandwiches were absolutely worth it, really happy with the selection I got, and I love the pastry / bread program they have!",1,0,0,Nivedita S.,"New York, NY",357,43,1

3.0,8/21/2017,"after destroying breakfast sandwiches in Tribeca after a 5K, we walked around the city a bit more (kinda hard to just sit down and rest immediately after a run), and as functional and productive members of society quickly realized we needed alcohol.unfortunately, society also frowns upon drinking early on a Sunday morning, but we got to High Street on Hudson just shy of 10:45 and were promptly seated. a promptly delivered jalapeno/whiskey/lemonade drink soothed the savage beast within me. delicious, refreshing, and just what I needed to be productive. and I needed a second one.immediately we eyed the bread sampler plate. the spreads (various butters and jams) are dynamite and the freshly baked bread was worth it. the large hash brown brick we split was alright, kind of overdone.I'm not in the area often, but am amenable to further explorations of the menu, and of course devouring more bread.

4.0,8/6/2017,"I'm a fan but be warned there's constructive criticism here.  Lovely choice for restaurant week. Granted, it isn't a super high-end place in which you might feel shouldn't take up a RW free space for you, but thought it was worth mine & hubby's while as they have an interesting selection that actually tries hard, along more variety to choose from which is a plus.  For summer RW, it was also relatively easy to make a ressie (and modify) which was refreshingly a plus right on OPT. We sat on a Sunday at 730 - the restaurant interior is spacious and lovely but even better was their al fresco dining right out front. We sat outside and were waited on prompt. The server did a good job making recommendations, answering questions about dishes.   For RW, they allow you to choose 2 starters and/or snacks, an entree, a dessert.  They said that each portion is scaled back for RW (and things like the chicken they had, are in essence, a worse cut etc). I had: - The beet cured salmon toast- beautiful, interesting, high quality, interesting flavor but just not my kind a guess; very pickled, very strong licorice. Not salty enough. Great toast though. - The oysters - 3 east coast selection which was kind of muted with a very mellow cucumber vinaigrette, this is where I would have preferred a meatier version and stronger flavors. Got a lot of Nordic/Eastern European vibes here in terms of flavor-The buckwheat gnocci - indeed it's a specialty with a yummy dill beurre blanc, caviar, dill. Not as sticky as in traditional potato gnocchi but still very delicate in their own kind of flour. So gladI got it as it wasn't heavy at all. The sauce was excellent for sopping up two pieces of artisanal, house baked bread (Italian white loaf). The bad?  There was zero portion size. Granted, they said the portions were scaled back but they were not kidding. Think I had less than 10 pieces of gnocchi, which honestly was not a lot to make someone full. The good thing is that I wasn't ravenous so I was doing ok.. -The sesame and black cherry cake  - not too sweet, subtle refined. Definitely black cherry and sesame flavor, esp the ice cream. The cake was spongy and delightful. - A glass of delicious full bodied Napa Valley RoseHubby had: - Crispy broccoli - delicious snack!  Just crispy broccoli in tempura with spiced onion mix. - The beef tartare. Not into (in general) but came in yummy thick potato skins. My hubby liked it. -Delicious corn beef-y almost brisket style beef (like roast beef), with a borscht type salad. Very delicious and flavorful. -The pineapple chocolate mousse trifle for dessert. Did not like this as much I'd though - great cream, chocolate mousse, and eh on the pineapple. They were prepared a bit too sweetly. -Some kind of IPA All in all, for us both - drinks, RW, tax/tip, it was $150 or so. I'd come back again for breads, brekafst or lunch which is where they seem to have all the money.",5,1,4,Stephanie Y.,"New York, NY",878,1242,25

2.0,7/28/2017,"I came with a friend for restaurant week. The selection was almost everything from the regular menu (which is nice considering that many places significantly limit their selections) but dishes were all disappointing.To start, they let you choose two appetizers. I had the best hummus and steak tartare. The hummus was surprisingly bland, accompanied by very thick, hearty bread that overwhelmed the hummus taste. The steak tartare was very salty to the point that I couldn't even finish the small portion. It was accompanied by overcooked, crisp and greasy potato skins.For the entree, I got the steak which was perfectly cooked but also overly salty. The cuts (four small pieces) were also particularly fatty. It came with a carrot and zucchini spaghetti type side that was surprisingly spicy. The dessert was a chocolate moose that tasted like someone in a JELLO plastic cup. It also came in one of those cups. I had two forkfuls and stopped.The tables are all very close together. There is very limited room to squeeze in and out if you need to go to the bathroom. We were so close to the couple next to us that they jumped into our conversation twice. Overhearing each other is unavoidable.I was drinking a lot of water and had to wait a good 10 minutes in between refills.Overall, the service and food are not recommended. The location is in the heart of the meatpacking district and walking distance to the highline. It's great. But, there's many other options in the area especially at this price point (with the restaurant week discount, without alcohol, we paid $58 each with tax and tip).",2,0,0,florina a.,"Buffalo, NY",524,123,260

I came here because their pastries were featured on NY.Eater and I'm a huge pastry fiend, and they did not disappoint. Their signature almond croissant is great, and they have great coffee as well (I can't remember but its from a NY coffee producer). They have a signature coffee drink with earl grey in it, and I wish I got it. For a light lunch I ordered the mushroom melt; seared king oyster mushroom, braised kale, green meadow young swiss, black trumpet mayo, and thin slices of apple. The other sandwich options sounded phenomenal, but I wanted something lighter to start my day especially with the pastries. Great sandwich that was flavorful with meatiness from the mushrooms and an overall balanced flavor with the kale and apple, although I didn't really get much of the black trumpet mayo. Perhaps it's more for the umami boost on your palate than something you distinctly taste.

I will try to go back to this place next time I am in NY and hopefully have the great experience that everyone else writes about on Yelp. Original Review: This is a service based review--My husband and I were in NY from Brazil meeting up with friends from London who were also in town. It was a rainy Saturday and we had been told great things about High Street on Hudson. We got there around 4pm, super excited to be seeing each other in New York but cold from the rain. We were greeted by some rude servers who said we were not allowed to sit inside because they were in their 'transition phase' from lunch to dinner. (I suggest updating your hours on Yelp to reflect this). Even though we had to sit outside, we had to order our drinks inside since there was also no ""table service"" during this time. We waited in the cold rain for about 15-20 minutes before our drinks finally arrived (2 of them were beers). I got the mezcal drink which was decent if you like mezcal but nothing fancy. All of our drinks looked like 'well-drinks' if that makes sense -- in a plain small glass with ice. I also tried the Bloody Mary which was pretty standard but good enough. We really didn't like the cocktail that had gin, champagne vinegar and raspberry (can't remember the name). It smelled and tasted like straight up vinegar.Even their website says: ""High street. Morning. Noon. And Night"" and their hours on Yelp claim they are open 8am-10pm. We walked a LONG way to get there and none of us know NY well, which is why we didn't go somewhere else. There was a nice way for them to handle this 'transition phase', which would have been to let us sit at a table in the corner inside instead of having us sit outside in the rain, that's just terrible service and plain rude in my opinion. There should always be exceptions, especially if you market yourself as a restaurant that is open morning, noon and night. The worst part was that when we would go inside to use the restroom, the whole staff was gathered in the warm dining area laughing, eating and chatting while 5 of their CUSTOMERS sat miserably outside. It appeared they were having a staff meeting. The only pleasant part of my experience was the host (or maybe a manager? it was hard to tell what his role was but he was dressed nicely) who let me trade out my friends vinegar cocktail for a Bloody Mary. He was quite pleasant and polite.I guess maybe this experience came down to expectation vs reality.

4.0,4/9/2017,"I've lost count of the number of Restaurant Weeks I've participated in over the years, but as each iteration goes by, there are fewer and fewer places that are able to pique my interest. This past season, however, High Street on Hudson joined the list of restaurants, and after skimming through their menu, rounded up my group of friends for our traditional Restaurant Week meal. As a Philly native, I'm certainly biased to begin with, but the restaurant has its roots in Philadelphia (known as High Street on Market) and after several successful years, opened up its first NYC location early in 2016. It has a prime location juxtaposed between the West Village and Meatpacking neighborhoods, and while breakfast and brunch are their signature meals, offer a regular dinner service as well.Despite the fact that there was a snowstorm the day of our reservation, the streets had been cleared up enough by nightfall that the three of us were still able to make it for dinner. The 60-seat interior isn't the most spacious, but has a takeout counter at the front as well as a number of table and booth seats. We were promptly shown to our table and given menus, although we'd all looked through them beforehand; orders were quickly placed and our appetizers were soon brought out.First, the Beet Cured Salmon Toast, which featured several thin slices of magenta-colored salmon on top of crisp toast and a horseradish cream cheese. There wasn't as much beet flavor as I was expecting, but I appreciated the slight zing of the horseradish against the cauliflower florets, and the slightly Nordic nod that the dish was taking. As for the Dry Aged Beef Tartare, the overall execution and flavor of the beef was well done, especially when paired with a creamy bearnaise aioli and a tangy gherkin vinaigrette, but the crispy potato skin it was served with wasn't a good alternative for simple toast; it wasn't strong enough to hold up the tartare, and seemed too oily.For the main dish, I had gone with the Artic Char after it had gotten a strong recommendation from our server. The dish was beautifully presented, with two filets that had been expertly cooked and retained a crisp skin after searing. It was plated over a bed of cauliflower, golden raisins, and pine nuts, and the mild sweet-savory flavors were the ideal complements to the fish. I tried my friend's Malfadine Pasta, which had an unconventional duck ragu sauce, and was pleasantly surprised at the robustness and richness of the sauce.For dessert, the Gingerbread Rum Mousse was quite the elegant finish. Presented in a glass cup, it had a deliciously light yet decadent gingerbread and rum-flavored mousse which was finished off with a layer of caramel, crumbled ginger cookies, and rum-infused currants. For those who like their desserts a little more unconventional, I have to give a nod to the Chocolate Balsamic, which paired a chocolate cake with a balsamic mousse, whipped cloumage, and sugared beet chips.When it comes to Restaurant Week, places either succeed or fail, and in the case of High Street on Hudson, they clearly achieved the former. I'd happily return for the weekend brunch (because, let's be honest, a weekday breakfast is a luxury few of us are able to have) to see what other options they have in store.",7,6,9,Lori L.,"New York, NY",2244,608,6827

We loved the tempura encrusted broccoli accompanied by a spicy, tart red sauce.  Next was the bitter greens salad that was nicely paired with brussels sprouts and various greens. We really really  enjoyed the pasta dish Rye Malfadine - delicious fresh pasta reminiscent of the curly edges of lasagna, cooked in a duck ragu with just the perfect amount of fennel that was subtle yet tasty.  Lastly we shared the artic char and it was delightfully cooked with the perfect  layer crispy skin surrounded by a bed of creamy caramelized cauliflower.  Dessert selections included the chocolate trifle and the olive oil panna cotta.  The trifle was decadent, rich and satisflying. The panna cotta was light, yet creamy with hints of middle eastern influences represented by sprinkled pomegranates and pistachios. The service was attentive and personal.  The setting was intimate, original, welcoming and warm.  We are definitely coming back for the much raved about Brunch and baked goods.  A great place for a night out, date night or celebratory meal.  A must try!",0,0,0,Vivian T.,"New York, NY",145,280,152

I think this place is a spin-off of high street on market in philly- I've been to this location and I loved the brunch menu there as well. I couldn't decide what I wanted because I love avocado toast (the tartine) but it's what I always get so I decided to get something different. I got a breakfast sandwich, the forager, - mushroom , egg, kale, swiss, mayo= YUM! We also got a side of bacon and I tried my friend's side of potatoes. The bacon was delicious- it wasn't like hard burnt but it was soft yet still cooked well. The potatoes had some mayo at the bottom-dip it in there! I like the presentation of the food as well. Service was wonderful!

After waiting until 8.45 I asked the hostess if we should leave our number and head to a nearby bar for a drink while we wait. (There's no bar in here, nor is there anywhere practical to wait.) She said yes. We went to a place across the street, had a drink and got the call. I told her we were just settling the check and would be a few minutes. She said she couldn't promise it would still be free so one of us should run back to claim the table. So I did. (Literally running across the street for a reservation, wtf?!) Get there and she's given our table to another couple, and we're now waiting for another table to finish dessert. So at 9.10 we're back to square one!

4.0,3/5/2017,"Came back to High Street on Hudson to give it another shot. The service was MUCH better this time. Our server was extremely attentive, and this time, we were in and out in a respectable hour and a half. And no one dared touch my plate until I was clearly finished :).As much as I'm not 100% on board with the ""pay for bread"" concept, we got the Bread & Butter anyway, and we were very happy we did. As mentioned, High Street on Hudson is known for their baked goods and breads, and the salted butter accompanying the fluffy slices was to die for. We next got the Kabocha Pumpkin Hummus, and it was as creamy and delicious as we remembered it. Next came the Beet Cured Salmon on Toast. The salmon + beet  + horseradish cream cheese combo was interesting (in a good way) and again, you can't beat the bread at High Street. However, I felt the cauliflower may not have been necessary. The texture was a bit off for me, and I don't think it added much to the dish. Remembering the gnocchi from last time, we got a small portion of the new Buckwheat Gnocchi. Alas, High Street, why did you change the gnocchi from before?!  I think it may be a seasonal issue, but the sweet potato gnocchi with the crispy potato skins in the fall was a superb dish. Now, the gnocchi itself was cooked perfectly, soft and billowy, as it should be. The dish was also very aesthetically pleasing (see pics below). However, the vodka beurre was a little too creamy, and the dish felt a little one note. The crispy buckwheat did add some interesting texture, but I'm not sure it did much to change the flavor profile. I would recommend adding a little heat or another type of herb to counter the richness of the dish. We opted for Beef Short Rib for our entrée. Unfortunately, we were expecting short rib in the traditional sense -- fall off the bone meat that melts in your mouth. However, this dish came with about 5 or 6 pieces of thinly sliced steak and a bone that didn't really add much else; I definitely didn't think the $32 price tag was warranted. The watermelon radishes, cabbage, and celery root accompaniment was quite refreshing, though. I think if this was perhaps called something else (""short rib"" brings the aforementioned connotation to mind) and the price was knocked down a few dollars, I think this would be a good dish. As is, though, it was not my favorite part of the meal, and wouldn't recommend it for the future. We ended with the chocolate cake, which we wolfed down in about 30 seconds flat. The whipped cloumage made this dish taste like a chocolate cheesecake, pretty much my favorite dish in the world. The candied beet chips gave this dish a delicious crunch. YOU MUST GET THIS CAKE IF YOU GO!Overall, we did have a nice meal, and the service made up for a few menu missteps. I probably won't go back for dinner (unless they bring back the sweet potato gnocchi next fall), but I definitely do want to try High Street for brunch, and would recommend anything carb based that comes out of the kitchen.",1,0,1,Sarah S.,"East Village, Manhattan, NY",176,9,32

FYI: The recipe is on Epicurious: epicurious.com/recipes/f…House-made ginger yogurt: This was my least favorite items that I ordered. The jome-made Greek yogurt had a slightly grainy texture that was thinner than what I prefer--a creamier, richer, and denser variety. It came topped with cardamom honey (lovely), pistachios, and sliced fresh apples. Almond and molasses cake: Rich, moist, dense, slightly gooey with two pieces of candied ginger and crushed nuts.

Four of the 5 of us got starters. The broccoli and the burrata.  They were definitely not shareable! Very small portions and while the food tasted delicious, it was gone in less then a minute.  $16 gone.  Drinks, the special drink was great, another person ordered a bourbon drink that had no bourbon lol it tasted like super sweet medicine lemonade.  Dinner arrived.  2 people ordered the ""large"" portion of the 2 available pastas. $28 each.  I would hate to see what the small portion looks like because the large was not even close to bring large.  Now I know NYC large and suburban dining large and this was small for NYC.  Someone joked that the small portion must be one strand of spaghetti in the center of a plate ;) Finally, these was only 1 vegetarian option on the menu... beet steak.  This sounded interesting until it arrived!  It was literally just 1 giant beet that was pouched? and served over lentils (lentils were great!).

4.0,2/14/2017,"High Street on Hudson had been earning rave reviews since the famed Philadelphia spot opened its Manhattan outpost.  Most of the buzz surrounded its home-style brunch, for which it was often hard to score a table.  So, I was thrilled that we were able to secure a reservation for their prix fixe dinner during Winter Restaurant Week.  Unlike other participants, High Street promoted the sharing of the first courses by creating family-style small plates and granting two selections per person.  The Beet-Cured Salmon balanced flavors of the earth and the sea. The fresh fish was served on thick slices of grained country bread that had first been covered with a horseradish cream cheese and a few small heads of cauliflower.  The Kabocha Squash Hummus was a bit of a disappointment in that it was too smooth and more of a puree than a thick hummus.  It was topped with charred shishito pepper shavings and a drizzle of black sesame oil.  One thick slice of house made, toasted volkornbrot bread had been cut into four pieces to use as a vehicle for the dip.  The bread was coarse and hearty, but the humus was a bit bland.  A salad of Winter Greens was plated with a ""ginger"" yogurt and walnuts, all topped with a smoked apple vinaigrette.  The salad was absolutely delicious, with a real seasonal warmth.  However, I put ""ginger"" in quotes, because the spice was hard to detect.  Lastly, the Dry-Aged Beef Tartare was slathered in a béarnaise aioli and served on crispy potato skins.  The presentation appeared sloppy, mushy, and greasy, but the flavor was unreal!  The appetizer we were initially the least excited about was really the star.  The potato tasted like an oniony pancake with a soft interior, which added even more flavor to the fresh meat.  Each bite was pure heaven!When it came to the entrees and desserts, we each got to choose our own.  My Arctic Char was cooked to picture perfection.  Two decent-sized filets were laying on top of sliced sunchokes and bok choy - a blend of Eastern and Western cultures.  A miso glaze added extra depth.   For my sweet course, I opted for the Chocolate Balsamic.  The rich chocolate cake was topped with a dabs of whipped cloumage cheese and balsamic mousse.  Crushed, sugared beet chips were sprinkled over the top and added texture to each forkful.  While the cake could have been more chocolatey, the creamy mousses made up for any lack of decadence.  The balsamic and beets countered the sweetness.Overall, High Street on Hudson delivered a flavorful New American meal in a casual, yet upscale atmosphere.   While dinner was great, I definitely would like to return for brunch.",10,4,6,Alison C.,"Hoboken, NJ",1125,1410,640

Didn't enjoy that we were seated right at the very front of the restaurant where it was cold when the door kept opening and was right in the commotion of everyone coming in. We asked to be seated further back but were told they were all reserved for other parties. We were also seated very closely next to another two-topper and could hear a lot of their conversation, which was pretty distracting/annoying...  Besides that the waiter was nice and helpful.  But moving on to food. Not all people in the party have to participate in the Restaurant Week menu, so I did and my sister did not. I like how the menu let you choose two appetizers for more variety. I got the beef tartare and smoked salmon. I liked the beef tartare better. Both came with two portions for me and my sister to try. My sister ordered the burrata, scrambled egg, and caviar appetizer and it was AMAZING. So so yummy I forgot to take a picture before we ate it all. For my entree, I got the malfadine pasta that was also FANTASTIC. My sister squid ink seafood pasta that was also good but definitely not as good as the malfadine.

4.0,2/10/2017,"Restaurant Week in NYC is a blessed event; it's a wonderful opportunity to sample the goods of so many restaurants I may not initially think to patronize. The menus can be hit or miss, depending on where you stop by to eat. High Street on Hudson definitely falls into the former category. My friends and I had a grand fest! Arriving around 6:15 after a nice ol' blizzard, the place was virtually empty but still filled up after 7 p.m., snow be damned! The interior is so beautiful, a striking mix of modern yet country. The scent of smoked wood wafted from the open kitchen as we seated. Perusing the R.W. menu was a challenge, as I was having a hard time deciding between to many excellent choices; lucky for us, they were offering two appetizer choices instead of one, which pleased me. I ended up the Crispy Broccoli, served with scallions and a spicy chow chow sauce and the Kabocha Pumpkin Hummus, served with seedy volkkornbrot bread. Both were excellent, though I wasn't expecting the chow chow spice to be spicy; I didn't know what it was and it wasn't indicated as spicy on the menu. Oh well! I managed. Haha. My friends each got the Beet Cured Salmon Toast and the Dry Aged Beef Tartate; I sampled the latter and that was some top notch tartare, indeed! The potato skin shell it was served in was a wonderful vessel for it. I got the rye mafaldine with duck ragu; mafaldine is a pasta I do not think I've ever consumed, and I am kind of in love with it now! A long small-width noodle with curly sides akin to a lasagna noodle, it definitely works will with picking up large amounts of the ragu with it. It was cooked to perfection! The duck ragu was crumbled meat with a slight sausagey flavor in a brown sauce, and I really enjoyed it. It's a warming winter dish. My friends, respectively, ordered the arctic char (highly recommended by our waiter!) and the pork loin. I had bites of both and they were very tasty; I'm not a fish fan, but this was cooked perfectly. The pork loin was also prepared well, just a teeny pink pink and nicely juicy. For dessert, the gingerbread rum mousse was a wonderful caramely treat, but the flourless chocolate cake with balsamic vinegar ice cream really knocked it out of the park! Balsamic vinegar and ice cream are two foods I wouldn't have seen melding well until I took a bite; WOW, one bite got me woke, as the kids say! (They're currently saying that, right? Ha!)Overall, this was one of the better Restaurant Week menus I've tasted in the past few years, and I could see myself coming back of my own volition to try their brunch or dinner at another point. I truly enjoyed everything I ate. Also, of note, our waiter, Beau, is not only wonderful but we both discovered our shared love of the show ""Schitt's Creek"", so I took a special shine to him.

4.0,1/24/2017,"RW 2017 winter dinner.Not sure how this place is during the day, but the ambience at dinner is perfect for dates. Shareable plates guarantee an intimate experience, and the RW menu is particularly fun because the first course consists of two small plates per person and everyone still gets to choose their own main. I got to try the pumpkin hummus, crispy broccoli, winter salad and vegetarian beet steak. The treatments of vegetables in these dishes could not have been more different but all of them were so damn delicious. The winter salad especially consisted of a mountain of seasonal greens topped with yogurt that far superseded an innocent plate of leaves as suggested by the name. I was going on a rant about how good the salad was until I was interrupted - and floored - by the smokey, earthy, firm yet tender beet ""steak,"" as if beets were not the most overrated vegetable of 2016. Dessert brought an expected note. Both the chocolate cake and rum mousse had a lot of sweet-and-savory thing going on that I didn't care for.Chef Eli - Teach me how to cook vegetables!

4.0,1/15/2017,"A cafe in the day / restaurant at night with great food & service. Farms to table like dishes where it is very apparent that they care a lot about their ingredients. Review for their dinner/restaurant portion: MUST TRY:BUCKWHEAT GNOCCHI $15/25 - Gnocchi had an amazing homemade texture. The sauce was a rich and savory warm melted butter with dill and small dollops of cool yogurt and caviar! BURRATA with scrambled egg & trout caviar $16 - The scrambled egg surprisingly was the best part! very fluffy and compliments the other ingredients well. the main burrata was a little tough but still enjoyable.STRIPED BASS $30 - the highlight of the night! Even those who don't usually order fish loved this dish. The meat was cooked so perfectly juicy and the skin so crisp and delicious! Also came with bok choy, mushrooms and sunchoke. the sauce was very light (soy sauce like?) and wasn't too over powering. overall an elegantly flavored dish. DUCK BREAST $28 - a beautiful dish with medium rare duck and gorgeous pink/white slices of beats and radish. the vegetables in this dish was very flavorful!Other dishes:CRISPY BROCCOLI $12 - Battered broccoli gave it a nice texture but the sauce was a little too sour and vinegary for my liking. BREAD WITH SPREADS $8 - The bread was great for dipping the gnocchi sauce but the spreads (apricot, maple butter, eggplant tapenade) were  just alright, especially the eggplant. I would skip.Per our waiters suggestion we split all the above between 3 people and it was just the right amount! I am definitely glad we had it family style so we got to try more dishes. Great service throughout the night with a very nice and friendly waiter and other waiters helping out to bring out and take away the food. I appreciate the speediness but almost too fast in some cases where a different waiter came by and scooped up our dish that we weren't finished with! Would have been nice if they asked us if we were done before they took our dish away :(",0,0,0,Hana K.,"Jersey City, NJ",49,92,146
2.0,1/15/2017,"Overall: disappointing. I was very excited to come to this restaurant for brunch because I have read nothing but positive remarks. We came on a Sunday around noon and the wait was only 30-35 minutes, which seemed great considering the neighborhood and time of day. We were seated at our table and shortly after placing our drink order we were kindly asked to move tables because of a hostess error; we happily moved and were brought a pastry to make up for the inconvenience. Atmosphere: cute but a little cramped. Not particularly comfortable and very loud both because of the music and proximity to other diners. Food: mediocre. Our food was cold upon arrival and was not particularly flavorful. My mom and I both ordered the breakfast tartine and would not order it again. Service: bad! (with one exception)...after nearly 30 minutes of waiting for our food to arrive we asked our server if our food was up on the counter waiting to be sent to our table and he said, ""no it's not!!"", in a way that both my mom and I perceived as very rude. He did not return to our table to let us know when we should expect our food. When our order did arrive the soft boiled eggs were cold, not simply room temperature, but cold! At that point we were ready to leave but were so starving that we stayed and finished what we could. This review would be one star if it had not been for the fantastic manager, Melissa. She went above and beyond to try and make up for her staffs shortcomings. She brought us warm eggs and comp'd our drinks (albeit, it was only iced tea). This restaurant is probably great when it's less crowded and the staff can more carefully look after each guest. The cranberry pastry Melissa brought us was a nice touch, but unfortunately the experience isn't one we wish to repeat.",0,0,0,Hilary R.,"New York, NY",3,15,35

This was delicious. It came with a yogurt sauce, green apples, walnuts and an apple vinaigrette.  There were also radishes and brussel sprouts sprinkled in which were cooked very well.  This was a fairly small portion.Burrata. It had a cottage cheese consistency, but was amazing. Came with heirloom tomatoes, ndjua oil, and rye crouton, the crouton was very well done.  Again, the portion size was quite small, however.Crispy broccoli. This was not my favorite but offered us a side to go with our duck.  It came with chow chow and scallion and had a bit of a kick to it.  The tempura flavor was kind of bland.Duck. Was cooked very well, but was a little on the fatty side - not to the point where i couldn't eat the skin but borderline.  Though, the skin was delicious and very well seasoned.  They only give you 4 slices of duck breast, so small portions seem to be a theme.  It is served over a bed of grains, tasted like farro.Ended up being $50 each, which seems pretty reasonable for 4 items + 2 glasses of wine total, though as noted the portions were on the smaller side.I will definitely be back to try their brunch.",2,0,0,Elyka A.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",198,204,634

My boyfriend took me here for a Saturday brunch and wouldn't tell me where we were going. Props to him because this place was amazing! We had to wait about 10 min for a table at around 11:30. The place isn't large and doesn't take reservations for brunch so you may have to wait a little bit. I would say at about 12 the place really had a wait going. Make sure you try the pasties they are phenomenal. You HAVE to try the squash doughnuts... I know sounds a little strange but boy were these things tasty. For my main breakfast item I had the Bodega, which was basically a fancy sausage egg and cheese. It definitely had some spice to it and you could tell the the biscuit was homemade and fresh. When it comes out it doesn't look huge but it is filling and exploding with flavor. My boyfriend got the pastrami and hash. Let me tell you I have never and still do not like pastrami... but one bite of this and I may be a new pastrami fan (but only for this sandwich).

2.0,10/3/2016,"We met here with a group of friends for dinner a few weeks back, and with the windows thrown open on a breezy Saturday night, it had a very nice, open, and casual feel to it. Our table wasn't ready on time - we did have to wait about 15 minutes or so, and the table to lean on outside is no great shakes - but in the end we did get seated a a booth that's tucked into a corner of the restaurant that faces the kitchen - a pretty convenient spot to be. Our servers were nice enough, always making sure we had full glasses, and the food did come out relatively quickly. The beer selection was unimpressive, but the couple of bottles of wine that we had were good (if somewhat generic).As for the food itself, I probably would have a little bit of a better opinion of it if we had realized ahead of time that the tasting menu meant we were sharing the portions, instead of being given our own plates. Sharing amongst 5 people is a bit awkward, and in the end, I felt like I did not get to sample anything an adequate amount as a result. Even though I did try many things for the $65, the value really isn't there. The food itself had some highlights - the best being the short rib, which was textured and extremely juicy, as well as the very good carrot hummus - but otherwise, much of the food was very generically new American without much direction or inspiration. The bluefish on toast was alright, but not any part of it was very memorable. I did enjoy the cauliflower pasta, but again - because of the sharing - I ended up with only a few pieces and thus didn't get to enjoy this very well-executed vegetarian-based pasta dish. Desserts were also split up for 5, and when you have ice cream involved, you end up losing a bunch of the food because of melting.I would like to come back again sometime, but I would almost certainly order a la carte and get my own properly-sized portions. I would definitely NOT recommend the tasting menu given you have to share it (unless you are with only one other person). Perhaps my opinion will go up if/when I come back, but based on this initial experience, it's not that high on my list.",2,0,0,Asuka N.,"New York, NY",371,1653,169

It's been awhile since I've met a breakfast sandwich I liked this much, and I think these breakfast sandwiches and I are going to friends for a long time.The sandwiches come on a variety of house-made bread. I had the forager and my boyfriend had the bodega. We loved the combination of ingredients on both of our sandwiches. On my forager, the mushroom was cooked perfectly, the trumpet mayo added a nice depth of flavor, good cheese and scrambled eggs. The only downside is that the sandwich is greasy and runny (you could see grease drip onto my cutting-board esque plate - which by the way is cute, but not convenient for eating messy foods). My boyfriend raved about the bodega also. The breakfast sausage had amazing flavor, cheddar is a classic on a breakfast sandwich, and it came on this perfect buttery biscuit. I have to admit I stole many bites of his biscuit.They also make a bunch of pastries. We tried this blackberry lavender cake thingy (it was recommended by the waitress) and loved it. I've also had a delicious pound cake here. I was not as impressed by the donuts - would skip these in favor of cakes. One downside I will point out is the slow service.

My friend and I split the seared mushroom sandwich and the chef's salad. If you are a burger fan, you would not want to skip the sandwich, especially considering the fact that High Street on Hudson had one of the better bread heartily prepared by Alex Bois.

The phily spin-off provides all-day meals and all-day breads as they are baked throughout the day. My friend and I shared grilled mushroom sandwich (with scrambled eggs inside) and chef salad (roasted turkey, soft boiled eggs, feta and veggies). I loved the grilled mushroom sandwich - layers of goodies - two pieces of soft bread with a natural sweet note hugging the fluffy and cheesy scrambled egg and savory mushrooms! One bite, hmmmm, I'm happy inside out! Lastly the grilled pickled hot pepper nicely balances the luxuries taste of the sandwich.I also get the Buckwheat cherry bread to-go.

We then proceeded to split a few things which we all know by now is my signature move.  We started with the crispy broccoli which was fried and Asian inspired.  This was interesting but we didn't love the execution. They then brought out the baked potatoes which we really liked and was made with vegan sour cream.  The mushrooms was our least favorite dish.  It was too pungent and vinegary, and we both adore mushrooms usually.  The long island duck was great, one of our top 10 duck dishes.  All in all it is a creative and fun menu although it was a mixed bag with us loving two of the dishes while the other two were meh.  I would try brunch or lunch however.",2,1,2,Sascha M.,"New York, NY",593,822,7

My friend got the breakfast sandwich that she loved but was mystified by the pepper it came with. We would have loved to ask about it but our server was sporadic.

3.0,6/13/2016,"I'm definitely missing something and I think it's probably the experience here at meals other than dinner. When Food and Wine magazine named them the top restaurant in NYC this past week, we grabbed an immediate reservation. Given this top prize, I had high expectations. The space is nice...casual and cafe-like but slightly cramped for the two-tops along the wall. Service was good. The menu was simple and I was excited to try it given focused menus with sharing plates are my jam. Here's a synopsis of the food we tried: Crispy broccoli - tempura broccoli with a tangy kimchi-like dressing. It was good. But you could fry a piece of cardboard and it'd be tasty. Burrata - very small portion but good Burrata. The prettiness of the dish outweighed the tastiness. Mushrooms - in the top two...an assortment of mushrooms in a bit of a creamy sauce. This dish would've been great with a side of crostini. But alas, we ate them solo. Bucatini - very good dish, simple and fresh. It's considered a full portion but it's an appetizer size. For $28. Good but I would not consider it worth the price. Duck - great dish...smokey and savory flavor and not too fatty. This would also not be considered an entree size dish as there were four small pieces of duck. As for drinks, I sampled both a cocktail and a glass of wine. Cocktail was meh...it wasn't complex at all and tasted like lemonade. The red wine list by the glass was primarily Long Island (which I don't care for) with only two choices outside of there...I went with a California cab which was decent but not great, especially not for $16/glass. Our bill was $200 without tip, and I was still slightly hungry when I got home. I'm still trying to figure out F&W's award.

1.0,6/12/2016,"After we finished dinner here, we had to go somewhere else to get an actual meal.Service: 5 star. Truly professional level staff. Food: The chicken was perfectly fine, if it cost $20 for a serving for 1 I would rave about it. It costs $52 for a serving for 1 however and then they lie and claim it will feed 4. The rest of the food is empty calories and fiber. Over-sauced pastas and lettuce essentially round out the menu and cost $15 to $30 per order for tiny 4 morsel tasting plates. Drinks: Poorly conceived. A teenager was locked out of the house with his parents garden and their patio bar. The result? Cheap liquor poured over ""Spring"" veggie flavors. I ended up asking them to just leave everything out and give me vodka on the rocks. Ambiance: It's a sandwich shop with tables and an open kitchen. Pleasant. Booths were comfortable and spacious and tables were properly spaced. I can find no fault with the restaurant here. Bit loud actually, no music but something about the place made the crowd noise echo. It was pretty hard to hear my table. Value: The only reason this place received a positive review from the NYT is because the NYT wasn't paying for their food. Simply nonsense, there is no reason to ever dine here. $90 per person for 2 (bad) drinks, about 2 oz of chicken per person, and a couple morsels of appetizer. Absurd, even for meat packing. You would be better served at a restaurant like Fedora. You would pay just as much but at least you would receive a special experience and extraordinary flavors for your investment. To be fair, my experience was with the dinner menu only. Other reviews seem to reflect that the lunch menu is reasonably priced and edible.

5.0,5/12/2016,"The review is for a Friday lunch, which could not have been better. We waited all of one minute for a table to clear. The pastrami sandwich is the alternative to Katz's: Thick sliced, on superior bread, great mouth feel. I am not saying it's better, but it is a different, yet equally satisfying experience in a more comfortable, less touristy restaurant. The roast pork sandwich with aged provolone and greens was a bit different from the Philly original. The meat was not sopping with gravy, and the cheese had an extra layer of complexity and funk. It's good sandwich, it just pales in comparison to the pastrami. On the side of the pork, a roasted banana pepper added a bit of zing. More zing can come from the chow chow on your table, but that didn't go with what we ordered. For a side we ordered a mix of giardinera, cauliflower and grilled asparagus.

Will definitely return for brunch when I'm up for the wait.Edit 6/2018: Had the turkey sandwich and little gem sandwich this time around, and while everything was delicious, I did think the portions were a bit small for the price.",2,0,2,Gab G.,"New York, NY",208,1651,5011
3.0,4/21/2016,"3.5 rounding down to a 3. Yes, High Street is better known for brunch / lunch and its breads and sandwiches, but it is not memorable as a dinner joint, especially considering its price point.The decor is extremely dim - to the point where I struggled to see what my food looked like, so definitely a good spot for a self-conscious first date if that's what you are striving for here... Service was very friendly and homely, giving educated advice on food orders and portion sizes.Some of the dishes were excellent, but others suffer from the traditional New American curse of just putting a bunch of ""interesting"" ingredients onto the plate together and praying it works. We ordered:- Vollkornbrot (4/5): yes, the bread is absolutely the best part about High Street. The vollkornbrot is excellent, filled with strong dark rye aroma and dipped in delicious rutabaga hummus. Just wish there were more than 4 tiny pieces that came with a $12 order.- Anadama (5/5): best thing on the menu. Eel and radish paired with sweet tomatoes on top of a slightly sweet molasses bread. It just works. But again, $16 for one small tartine?- Tripe diavola (3/5): not quite spicy and sounded more interesting on paper than it did in taste. Just your standard tripe dish without much to make it too interesting.- Grilled squid (3/5): five stars for the plating - the dish is pretty as a picture, but again, nothing to write home about. Carrots add a nice crunch I suppose? But the squid itself is just nicely cooked, perhaps on the dryer side.- Cauliflower caramelle (4.5/5): High Street does carbs the best. These little stuffed pastas are absolutely fantastic, swimming in delicious rosemary and buttermilk that reminds you of an elevated version of the traditional Italian sage and butter preparation. Delicious, but very small portion size - have I mentioned that before? Among the four of us we probably got two small caramelle each. Did I also mention this costs $24?- Seaweed bucatini (4/5): again, carbs shine here and this is another winner. Comes with nice crab lumps and topped with scallions to give it almost an Asian inspiration. Portion is a bit more generous as well (i.e. we maybe could have three bites instead of two).- Both the entrees (duck and beef) were good but absolutely standard modern American preparations (i.e. forgettable). I'd double up on the pasta.- Saving graces would be that the desserts are actually extremely interesting. We had a carrot cake that was perfectly baked and slightly crispy on the outside and a little moist on the inside, served with a scoop of slightly salty bourbon ice cream that complemented the flavors perfectly. The salted caramel and chocolate budino was also excellent, but runs the risk of being slightly too salty than sweet.All in all, I'd come back to High Street for dinner if it was half the price and put its breads and pastas - what it is really good at - much more front and center. But for now, just ok.",3,0,0,Chenxi L.,"Manhattan, NY",574,14,41

5.0,4/13/2016,"While visiting New York, many people told me about a cafe spot that originated from Philadelphia and is killing it in the meat packing district. I heard they made great sandwiches and thats exactly what I came in for. The interior gave off a upscale/relax feel for lunch.I ended up ordering their take on a pastrami sandwich while my girlfriend chose the duck meatballs sub. Both our meals were amazing! I really enjoyed her sub because the toasted bread and the flavor coming out of each duckball. These sandwiches are priced pretty high but they are quite filling. I left stuffed and at the end of the day, I want my meal to do that. For my sandwich, they had big thick cuts of pastrami and gooey cheese falling off the side. Overall, just really elevated flavors in each meal. I would 100% come back when Im back in NYC. Service was awesome and made sure we were enjoying all meals. 5 out of 5 in my opinion.

3.0,4/11/2016,"We had a great meal at High Street and whoever is working in the kitchen knows how to prepare interesting and amazing dishes.  The cauliflower pasta and the chicken were excellent, as was the crispy broccoli.  The experience -- including service, menu selection and price were problematic at best.  To begin with the menu was tough to figure out.  There is one list to choose from.  Some of the items are small dishes, others medium or large.  There is on indication as to what is small or large.  Most restaurants separate those items and list them on different pages or with lines between the two groups.  Here the demarcation is fuzzy.  You have to try to figure this out through the price of each item.With regard to price High Street is high.  A three pound chicken was $52.  A prima piatti plate of pasta was $24, the broccoli and bread plates are $11.  A glass of Syrah was $15.  These are high prices for the Village and high prices given the quantity and standard of service and casual nature of the restaurant.",0,0,0,Tony R.,"Manhattan, NY",11,219,1

We waited by the bakery in the front and had a citrus doughnut and crepe cake to start, both of which were solid, particularly the latter. For our meal, we split the hickory town and the bodega sandwiches, both of which were very good. I thought the hickory town in particular was really good, the cheddar and mayo going very well with the meat, while the bread on both sandwiches was also great. The old bay potatoes were also very good, lightly fried without being overcooked.

2.0,4/10/2016,"Dinner review.  Totally underwhelmed and can't understand the hype in a city with countless restaurants that deliver on a much higher level.  Portions are comically small for a menu that is meant to be 'shared', and the food is mostly forgettable.  Got some bread to start as this is one of their 'things'.  I love good hearty, dense, nutty bread, but ultimately, it is just bread.  I don't need to hear about the German origins of our choice or any other backstory for that matter.  Get over it.  What I would like is more than 4 tiny slices of toast (I do mean tiny) for our $11 bread course.  A bad omen for the rest of the meal.The remainder of the courses followed a similar pattern.  The burrata, risotto, pike, beef...all well executed but unexciting and portioned in a manner that was impossible to share.  I'm not looking to be stuffed, but I should expect more than a single taste of a 'shared' course.  The broccoli was fine, it's broccoli after all.  The buccatini was the one standout.  Delicious and appropriately sized.  Finished with two tiny pieces of unremarkable cheese and oat ice cream on top of oats in a blueberry compote of sorts.  Our mistake for not thinking it through prior to ordering, but oat ice cream on a bed of oats?  virtually inedible unless you're a horse I suppose.Solid cortado and all American wine list from small producers with an Old World style, which is laudable, but limiting.  Head to Rebelle, Estela, Pearl and Ash or down the street to Barbuto which are just a few of the many restaurants which pull off this style of restaurant in a far, far superior way.",2,1,1,Vince G.,"New York, NY",0,49,6

We ordered the following:Daily Bread plate - horrible and two out of three of the spreads were inedibleBurrata - I didnt actually see any burrata, but I assume it was there. Very strange dishCauliflower Caramelle - this was the best dish by far! Really delicious. Problem was, caramelle are pretty small and thin pieces of pasta. I believe there were about 6 on the plate. So disappointing!Crispy broccoli - totally not exciting and completely forgettable, even though the waitress raved about it.Our biggest problem were the portion sizes. When the waiter brought the ""deconstructed carrot cake"", I literally said out loud, ""are you f**ing kidding me?!"". After I apologized for my profanity we literally had to laugh at this point.

4.0,4/5/2016,"KenScale: 8.0/10There are not many all-day restaurants in New York City; it takes certain amount of courage and dedication to operate a place in this hectic, high-rent city. Yes, there have been some restaurants notable for offering some amazing breakfast and/or lunch options, but mostly the focus of most restaurants in Big Apple still lies in dinner. Chef Eli Kulp and his business partner Ellen Yin came all the way from Philadelphia to change that with a New York outpost of their highly acclaimed High Street restaurant. In the morning, the restaurant is a bakery serving pastries; at lunch, it serves a variety of sandwich options; for dinner, it becomes a full-fledged restaurant incorporating many of the breads baked in the morning. That kind of versatility is a scarce asset in New York dining scene, and I was certainly intrigued to see what kind of food the kitchen was delivering. Overall, I had a very pleasant dining experience on my recent weekend dinner. There is nothing fancy about the food at High Street, but you can tell that a lot of thoughts and preparations have been devoted to it. There are a handful of toast menus, and I enjoyed the one with smoked eel, spicy radish and parsley that had a lot of delightfulness to each bite. Among a small list of pasta dishes, don't skip seaweed bucatini that comes with nduja, mussels, bread crumb and lobster bottarga. It was a wonderful (and beautifully plated) pasta dish that has great balance of flavor; I initially wished the noodle were a little bit more firm, but over time, the softer texture of noodle started to gel really well with the other elements of the dish. For the entrees, I felt the Long Island duck was a bit more successful than grilled arctic char. Arctic char, which came with crispy potato, mustard greens, pickled gribiche and black olive, came away a little too aggressive in seasoning, although the fish itself was very nicely cooked. On the other hand, duck was cooked to near perfection for absolutely juicy, tender texture, and worked harmoniously with soured oats and grains, charred leek and turnip that accompanied it. For dessert, we had roasted milk chocolate with Japanese cheesecake, preserved lemon and cocoa bean, a solid but not particularly memorable dish.The restaurant has a somewhat concise menu of wine (many of them from the nearby New York area) and beer and I wish they could've really ramped up their wine selection to make the dinner even more memorable. Getting a reservation wasn't particularly challenging, but the restaurant has been getting a lot of buzz lately and the dining space is not particularly large, so make sure to book in advance if possible. I really liked the inviting vibe of the dining space that makes it well-suited for the type of all-day neighborhood restaurant that it strives to be. Well, there is at least one Philly import that has made a successful move to New York; I'm curious to see if other Philly restaurateurs and chefs will follow the path of chef Kulp. Certainly, High Street on Hudson is the type of restaurant that is so reliable as to make it a place that you would want to visit again.",5,0,0,Ken S.,"Manhattan, NY",512,612,4738

Layers of textures and flavors and an array of sauces and pickles to jazz it up to your liking, all sandwiched between a very pretty poppyseed bun. Served on a cutting board- there isn't anything else you need besides coffee to wash it down. The meatpacker is also a tasty well-rounded plate of food. I found the coppa salty, but that's easily fixed. Take a bit of that with the eggs and broccoli rabe for an excellent bite. The potatoes steal the show, almost halfhazardly broken up with rough edges that increase the surface area = crispy and crunchy all around. Highly recommend arriving early.

We started with the grilled squid appetizer which came with pistachios, carmelized yogurt and grilled carrots. It was incredible - so flavorful and an amazing combination of textures. We also had the crispy broccoli which was interesting but definitely my least favorite of all the dishes. It has a spicy, pickled Asian taste to it and isn't greasy at all despite being fried. For entrees we had the cauliflower caramelle and I have to be honest - I've eaten an insane amount of pasta in my life and this was one of the absolute best. It was like a soup dumpling filled with cauliflower/cheese purée and the black garlic butter sauce with rosemary was perfect and not overpowering. I cannot recommend this enough. The other main dish we had was the seaweed bucatini. Again, this was a very intricately crafted recipe with truly wonderful textures - every bite had a different element to it. I've never had anything quite like it and I would definitely order it again. For dessert we had the cocoa bean which is cacao mousse, tahini mousse and chocolate crunch with some lemon mixed in there somewhere. It was definitely one of the most unusual desserts I've ever had but it was so delicious.

We popped in a second time just to grab pastries and that experience was all well and good also. This morning on other hand has put me off quite a bit. There is an inexplicable gap in the seating process. We were quoted a wait time of 30 minutes and not only were sat after 50 minutes, we were sat after THREE other parties who came after us. And within minutes of another party who arrived well after us. Not to mention during this almost 1 HOUR wait time there were 4-5 WIDE OPEN tables unused with no one seated. Not only that but there was NO remorse or sympathy on the part of the hostesses when they realized the seating error. We stood right by them as they continued to seat other people who arrived after us. We bit our tongues not wanting to cause a scene and I at least hoped to get some sort of empathic comment from one of the two ladies managing the seating but that was wishful thinking. We were finally seated, with no acknowledgement of the wait time or the error.I enjoy the food here and was planning on being a loyal patron but not if this is how every visit is going to go.Come here if you want a good meal but have an hour to kill and don't care if the staff treats you with minimal regard.",4,1,1,Diana O.,"Los Angeles, CA",137,25,16
5.0,1/14/2016,"What a fantastic new addition to the West Village. All of the breads were made in house and were moist and delicious, especially with the apple-butter and malt-butter they serve them with.I had the pastrami on Rye which was by far the best pastrami I've had in the city (and I've had most of em'), it was cured in house and the rye bread was baked fresh, really fantastic.The rest of my group loved their food as well and the owner was really friendly and came by a lot to make sure we were doing well. Service was great and I ended up buying some bread, pastries and Rival Bros coffee beans at the counter near the front.If you can try and sit at the bar around the side of the open kitchen, its really neat to watch them prep all the food and its essentially a chef's table for two. Looking forward to what they come up with for their dinner menu.",1,0,1,Dave P.,"New York, NY",172,411,321
5.0,1/13/2016,"Easily the best breakfast in Manhattan. Can't speak for other times of day, yet... But you should eat here! Breakfast sandwiches are a bit petite but come with a little bottle of jalapeño sauce that is just delicious. The highlight on the much larger breakfast plate was the greens sauteed with ham",1,0,0,Mike B.,"New York, NY",15,402,20

5.0,1/10/2016,"Stopped by on Sunday and was told there would be a bit of a wait. But they do take your number down and contact you when the table is ready. We decided to order at the counter and steal the two bar seats near the coffee stuff to eat our ""take out"" -- we were not the only ones who did this ha! The forager was very delicious (and vegetarian). Mushrooms were meaty and tasty even though they fell off the sandwich. My boyfriend had the turkey sandwich and said how moist and great it was. Also tasted the Oat cake which was sort of like shortbread with jam in the middle. Want to come back and try the bagels and salads!",1,0,0,hannah s.,"Manhattan, NY",0,51,6

5.0,1/3/2016,"""Best new brunch addition in the West Village""Never Been to the Philly spot, but I went here with my Philly born gf on a Sunday brunch exclusion.All was excellent.  From the service to the food that was rich but not over indulgent, this is a great spot. Especially since good, unpretentious spot in this neighborhood is about as rare as a blue zebra.  This is like Le Pain Quotidien with a double upgrade.  Bread is the center, but the carbs are worth it.We had:- Pastrami and Hash, a heavenly mashup of Pastrami, fried potatoes, Russian dressing on a very tasty, flavorful roll.- The Forager, an egg, mushroom, kale, Swiss concoction.- The Grains -- Faro and Squash Salad.  This was the only dish that was just fair.  It had a mushy consistency and lacked a cohesive flavor.- Spiced Donut:  A small, but intense sugared donut with a Carmelesque jelly center.  A perfect way to end the meal!If you are looking for a solid alternative for a brunch spot that is not over the top, you should try it this year!",2,0,0,Brion R.,"New York, NY",344,242,10
5.0,12/30/2015,"I can't get over this place. The pastrami sandwich is a must. The broccoli salad is also a must. I don't know if I caught them on a good day or what... But I stumbled in here with my friend in town originally let down that we had settled on a place that wasn't for ""foodies"" and then we sat down and realized with each bite that this place is going to be big. I feel lucky we only had to wait 20 minutes. We also split the triple sides... And let me tell you, you can't go wrong there either. The pastrami Gods are smiling, and so is everyone else who leaves here. Great, quality, flavorful, beautiful food.",0,0,0,Sarah H.,"Manhattan, NY",54,24,8
5.0,12/29/2015,"Went here after hearing all the buzz with a friend and it was a wonderful experience from start to finish. There was no wait time as of yet but I'm sure its going to start getting packed.I'll always love breakfast and this place does breakfast justice. My friend ordered the Pastrami and Hash and I ordered The Bodega sandwich and a latte using Rival Brothers Coffee. Lets take sandwich. The Bodega is a sausage, egg, and cheese but where High Street on Hudson succeeds is the sage-pepper biscuit that brings it altogether. Flaky, savory, and buttery and holds up well. There was also a green pepper sauce which you could use and gave the sandwich a great spicy kick. You can also do take out if you so wish though I'd advise to eat the sandwiches right there and then. FRESH. I also got one of the spice doughnuts which is basically a doughnut ball. Not too sweet but a bit on expensive side considering its size. Will definitely come back to try other things on the menu.",3,0,3,Raymart D.,"Flushing, NY",478,233,419
3.0,12/24/2015,"Not really for me.Oatmeal was ok, toast had some strange apple butter which didn't work.Seemed a bit chaotic (no menus) but chalk that down to it being new.Cappuccino a pale imitation of what's on offer elsewhere and didn't act as an 'eye opener' Shame, as location is stunning (was always a big fan of cafe cortado before in this location) and it's clear money's been lavishly spent in the refurb and subsequently a nice dining room.It's ok. They're are better places within a stones throw however.",6,4,3,John B.,"London, United Kingdom",215,380,1342
4.0,12/22/2015,"Glad this NYC outpost of the Philly OG finally opened, just in time for the holidays. Staffers at the takeout/pastry/coffee counter at the entrance were friendly but clearly in opening mode. The warmed (forever yet not warm) red eye danish $4.50 was tasty but a bit of a mess...and the cocoa sammie $3.50 was pretty chalky, with nowhere near enough juniper. Beware the too-long, slippery mat near the register..but grab some tasty bread samples.",4,0,1,George C.,"New York, NY",0,7747,14304
5.0,12/21/2015,"The new location of the super popular Philly spot is even better than the original, with some great new menu items and a more sensible layout.Now you can peruse and purchase the great pastries from the takeout counter up front, rather than fighting your way through the line to get to the register in the back like in the first location.For breakfast, I tried a few of the great new choices. The Whitefish Bialy ($7.50) is a startlingly black (squid ink) disc topped with whitefish and pickled peppers - definitely a fork and knife deal, and less of a sandwich. The slightly crispy bialy is delicious and goes well with the salty whitefish. Also, The Bodega ($13) is an incredible, rich take on a sausage, egg and cheese. For the bread, an amazing Sage-Black Pepper Biscuit is used, adding even more butteriness to the equation, which is definitely not needed, but still very welcome. These few options make me want to stop off frequently before work, since they are gone at lunchtime (except on the weekends, when they are served along with the brunch menu).On the way out, I picked up some of the pastries (I passed on the Red Eye Danish, but only because I've tried it in Philly, and it is a great choice if you only get one thing). I also tried an Everything Bagel ($2.50), which is not at all like a classic NY bagel, in that it is very small and quite crunchy, but it is really delicious.I will be back very soon for the excellent sandwiches at lunch, such as the Duck Meatball Sub and the Grilled Cheese.",20,7,15,Mike C.,"Forest Hills, NY",5000,1694,69834
