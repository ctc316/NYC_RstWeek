1.0,4/28/2019,"Oh my god, what a disappointment. As serious middle-eastern food lovers, we came here expecting a wonderful Sunday brunch. The photos advertised here of the restaurant looks are completely the opposite of what it really looks like- very sleepy and plastic decor. The 1 star is given to the charred eggplant dip and our nice server+runner. However, the food and drinks service was very slow. Do not expect to get a good alcoholic drink here, there is no bartender (on a Sunday brunch!). Ordered the mezze and shakshuka. The mezze pitas were advertised to be with zaatar- they were not. The supposedly poached eggs in the shakshuka were completely hard boiled, filled with at least 20 whole garlic cloves. And the absolute worse thing is the pita that came with the shakshuka were 100% warmed up in the microwave, which means they are not fresh and they were super chewy. I worked many years in Israeli restaurants and I am Israeli myself so it's very hard for me to accept the fact that this is an Israeli chef's restaurant. Very disappointed. Very unpleasant experience.",0,0,0,Dana B.,"Manhattan, NY",90,19,14
1.0,4/13/2019,Terrible service. Great ambiance but the lack of service left a bad taste... ended up getting my own drink at the bar which does not accept cash. There isn't variety of food available.

The menu has a wonderful selection of Mediterranean dishes and we were both impressed with their descriptions as well as the choices that we made. We started with Fried Cauliflower with a lemon cream sauce that was so delicious that we were in culinary heaven!

Of course, before taking a seat, the host gave me this information. I had asked the hotel staff for other options as well, but decided that a buffet including coffee wouldn't be bad considering I had just flown in from Frankfurt. The staff was unprepared at opening. Things were on the floor, etc. I waited another ten minutes before I got my food. The waitress gave me my bill and it was 20 dollars.

1.0,12/16/2018,"Everything about this restaurant is wrong.- Online descriptions fail to tell you that it is located in the Yotel, which is an economy hotel. - Despite the fact that we may have been his only table, our server wanted to be somewhere else besides serving us- Ingredients for the mezze plate were mixed in another century and were mediocre at best. When we asked for more pita bread, we were told that would have to pay for a seperate Pita bread order. - The Burrata is smothered in poor-tasting smears and jellies- Despite being marketed as a mediterranean restaurant, the Kebabs were overcooked and terrible.

3.0,11/22/2018,"I decided to take my mother here for Thanksgiving dinner. The restaurant was clean and fancy. It was a tad empty however. Our waiter Angel was very nice and accommodating. We ordered tea it was very aromatic and delicious. I ordered the Thanksgiving 3-course meal: pumpkin soup, the pork chop, pumpkin spice cheesecake. The pumpkin soup was delectable -- hands down, the best item on the menu! There were roasted pumpkin seeds that gave it a good flavor. The pork chop was good, but a little dry. The pumpkin spice cheesecake was good. My mother ordered the meatballs and green beans. The meatballs had a good flavor, but they were chewy and very difficult to swallow. In addition, the green beans were bland, stringy, and still had the ends on them. We asked for Angel and told him about the situation with meatballs. Angel spoke to one of the head waiters, and the head waiter told Angel that he's never had a problem with the meatballs before in Spanish. funny thing is that we understand Spanish and we knew that he was gossiping about our issue. Then the head waiter comes to the table and says ""Oh hi how are you sorry that you weren't satisfied with the green beans!"" this is extremely superficial. Don't talk about us in Spanish and then try to mediate the situation in English. I appreciated that they didn't put the meatballs on the bill and they replaced it with spare ribs that were not that great either but oh well.

5.0,10/23/2018,"The dishes are a myriad of distinctive flavors. The dishes are seasoned with spices directly from the region and feature ingredients that are fresh and locally sourced. The experience at Green Fig was kind of like having dinner at someone's house.  Family style, the dishes are meant to be shared and food arrives, as it is prepared, in no precise order. I absolutely loved the food. The ingredients gave every dish a zesty taste and you could truly savor the variety of flavors in each bite. The menu is unique with some of the favorite and traditional Mediterranean dishes like hummus and chickpeas, but the way they fuse these dishes is what makes Green Fig truly one of a kind.Read more on my blog: cessiecerrato.wix.com/ce…",0,0,0,Cessie C.,"Manhattan, NY",370,158,415

2.0,4/4/2018,"The service here is horrible. No one knows how to pay attention to guests. Being located in a hotel, it is its own restaurant, so nothing can be charged for room service and they cannot make a delivery to any rooms in the hotel, despite the fact that their kitchen is an elevator ride away from hotel guests. This morning I ordered a fruit bowl and tea, specifically asking for honey and lemon. The person I spoke with said they would be included, but I still didn't get any honey or lemon, and the tea was served in a tiny cup, with a tea bag. They told me that's the only size they offer. When I reached to get my bag of food, the hostess thought I was trying to shake her hand, and was a bit shocked and awkward when I reached for my bag. I came in later that day, asking for a glass of water. I took a seat in a booth, and the hostess puts the water on the bar and says there's your water, even though I was sitting in a booth. I had to actually TELL HER and the waiter to bring the glass of water to me at my table. These people are in the service industry, and they really need to step it ALL UP. At dinner, I had to run up to my room to make a phone call, and told my waiter I would be back. When I got back everything was cleared away, including my half glass of wine. Please be aware this restaurant's  service needs improvement. The managers/ owners need to train their staff on hospitality and how to be detail oriented.

4.0,3/31/2018,"This review is solely based on the breakfast at the Green Fig and not the dinner (however, their dinner and alcoholic beverage menu looked delicious). If convenient, I would recommend the Green Fig; however, I would not walk over half a mile or pay for an Uber to dine here. The breakfast menu is very, very simple. There were only a few items on the front and back; however, there was something for anyone (vegetarian or meat lovers). We ordered the chicken sausage wrap and the two egg breakfast (which included chicken sausages and bacon). The bacon was ginormous and the chicken sausage had a nice sweet taste to it. Medium well eggs normally end up runny in other restaurants; however, they were cooked to perfection here. The chicken sausage wrap was very filling and I was only able to eat two-thirds of it. It also came with a greens salad that had a light citrusy taste to it. The service was really good and everyone was super nice; however, it took a while to get a menu and check or the attention of the waiters in general.

No greets from the staff behind the bar. No hostess around. Everyone was just nonchalant. Too busy having their own personal conversations. I told my significant other -screw it; let's sit ourselves. We sat. Both order the SDF Burgers. Boy was it salty. It was one of the saltiest burger I've had. Couldn't finish it- took it to go- why no idea; we didn't even have a refrigerator in the room so what was the point. Ended up throw out so much food. It was such a waste. I would have been happy eating burgers from McDonalds. Best part of the meal was the vanilla ice cream & water. Our waitress just was bleh.

First, my $13 drink had half a shot in it, if I wanted a glass of juice I would have ordered that for $4.. Second, the carrots that were part of my bfs entree were charred to a crisp, they were so burnt he couldn't even eat them. Third, my entree was undercooked. I had the grilled fennel, which I personally make all the time, and it was so tough I could barely use a regular knife I should have asked for a steak knife. Out of the four course meal that was offered we were only satisfied with the appetizer, being the scallops. Fourth, the dessert we ordered, the chocolate mousse, was just smeared on a plate it wasn't appealing at all. The general manager came out twice, the first time giving us a 'complimentary salad' which wasn't good and we didn't eat, and then came out a second time giving us a 'complimentary dessert' which was ""creme brulee"". It honestly tasted like they made a pudding out of fruit loops. And now lastly, while I have absolutely no problem with this, there were drag queens walking in and out of the restaurant constantly, I guess putting a show on for Yotel Hotel, but it was so distracting and completely unprofessional. It took the focus off of what was supposed to be a romantic dinner and put the focus on something completely irrelevant. If we wanted to see a drag show we would have bought tickets to it. It honestly just ruined our night. We spend $120 for what should have cost at most $40. When we asked for the general manager at the end to discuss our check he was no where to be found.

The food was tasty but took FOREVER to get.  And when I asked for grated parmesan for the mushroom risotto, I was told that their parmesan was 24 years old and so it was too good to serve on my risotto.  They will not even let you pay for their special parmesan.  It's too good for you.  Be prepared to pay for bread (only $3, but also only 4 super small, teeny, tiny triangles of pita).  Just go somewhere else, unless you like being treated like an unwelcome guest.  I love the hotel, but this restaurant is just terrible.",0,0,0,Carol H.,"Downingtown, PA",1,10,0

5.0,12/26/2017,"What a great experience! My friends and I (one a vegetarian) made brunch reservations here for Christmas Day after falling in love with the menu online. We were warmly greeted and sat promptly. Water was brought right away and menus as well. However they were Christmas price fixe menus- that had nothing we had planned on ordering. We called over the waiter who brought us a la carte menus but they too were limited. We asked about the brunch and were told they were not offering it. After we explained how much we had been looking forward to it, the manager very nicely agreed to bring over the brunch menus. To which I responded thank you in Hebrew correctly guessing his Israeli accent. :) What can I say? Started with the fried cauliflower. Amazing! Don't let the fry part scare you! We were also served complimentary hummus, labneh and grilled eggplant! Already in heaven, we then shared shakshukah (wow), a Malawach sandwich with tomato coulis and the most surprising taste- Israeli Benedict. Starting with falafel on the bottom, topped with poached eggs and a lightly lemony hollandaise. A perfect meal at very affordable prices!

5.0,11/30/2017,"Staying at the Yotel, it was a convenient choice, and I was not scared away by the yelp rating. I was pleased with my choice.The test of Mediterranean spots in my book is the mezze platter. It came with 6 bowls, which was a fair price and great value, and abundant. Eggplant dip and tahini were very differentiated, and I came to learn the tahini is imported from Isreal, which explained the differentiation. The fresh-baked flatbread with the platter was abundant and had a NYC-pizza like quality, so a cool fusion especially as the mezze comes with a tomato sauce dip not normally found in mezze platters. That dip had a great acid bite on the crispy parts of the flatbread in between rich bites on fluffier bread hunks with the other dips. Crinkle-cut shavings of pickled carrot and other root veggies was unique and a great break between bites as well. Overall, a great plate compared to the pre-made dolmas and pre-prepared hummus with cold old pita you get with many mezze platters. Maybe other yelpers expected something different, or had other dishes (though I cant say anything about the cocktails). Great attentive service, fun vibe and atmosphere, would have been better with my wife if at home vs. being on a biz trip.I also had the yellowtail fatoush salad, dressed well with a nice brine finish from the fish, it was different in a good way, and tasty while I still worked on the platter. Overall, enjoyed the meal, appreciated the selection of local draft beer.

1.0,11/16/2017,"I had a CRAZY bad experience in this restaurant. Like I'm haunted to this day. I hope women take note and stand together on this one. I was a guest at the hotel where the restaurant is located. You can order drinks payable with $15 worth of daily ""hotel credit dollars"", but you have to order the drinks by loudly saying your room number across the bar to the bartender, which is the first of the very unsafe things I experienced in this disgusting place. Incidentally, $15 pays for ONE vodka soda, but that's fine. I'm pointing that out to show I had only ordered one drink, while the patron next to me commented on my memory of my room number.Yikes.  It was Saturday night. The night before that I'd been in the bar and playing Connect Four, a large bar game with another patron who offered to buy me and the group of us drinks, and I allowed him to buy me two vodka sodas. What a whore, I know. He was creepy, and that was that. The next night, around 11:30, I went to the bar to use my dollars again and looked around for him. Not seeing him-- he was not a guest of the hotel and also in from out of town-- I sat at the bar and ordered my first drink of the evening when the man from the night before walked up behind me and demanded to buy me champagne. He was visibly intoxicated and looking for me. I was so frightened I literally ran away and left before I'd had one sip of my drink. The intoxicated man followed me into the lobby and began screaming in my face, ""What's f&&king wrong with me? Why don't you f&&king like me?"" I decided to complain to hotel security. Hotel security spoke to the restaurant's management and they decided NOT TO REMOVE THIS DRUNK, CRAZY MAN from the restaurant. I did not feel safe in his presence, so I was the one who had to leave. Security and the restaurant's management made it clear they felt this intoxicated man's entitled, bizarre, threatening, and terrifying behavior was somehow my fault. What. The. Actual. Eff?? (Can you curse on Yelp?)I urge my fellow women to join me in never setting foot in this misogynistic establishment again. We can't let them treat us like this. We don't deserve it. Men are not entitled to do it. It's not our fault. This is what it boils down to: a drunk man screamed in my face because I wouldn't let him buy me a drink and Green Fig was like, yeah, that's cool!

A reservation was made for a friends birthday, we were a group of 6. The day prior to dinner an emailed a confirmation was sent. We arrived little earlier than the reservation and the area looked closed. We were then directed to the receptionist. The receptionist looked up the information and we were told that the place was closed for a private party. They could move us outdoors but the menu would only be for snacks and drinks. This was in the middle of July during a HEAT WAVE, it was 90+ degrees outdoors. The receptionist waved a phone to us letting us know we were notified via text message at 2pm the day of the reservation, that the reservation was cancelled. Firstly a text message was not received (For something like this you think they would have CALLED instead to apologize. Secondly, if this was closed off for a private event why was an email sent the day before?  My reservations were made 3 if not 4 weeks in advance. It was ridiculous, to be told our reservations were cancelled, on top of being told that the reservations were cancelled in advance, 5 hours before the time we had reservations which was never received was ""advanced"" notice for them.

Alejandra was the manager inside the restaurant and was rude to me when I asked her why they are charging me for a refill as I received the chips due to a bad experience. She was like there's nothing I can do....over an orange juice! I was just taken aback. Here's the thing... I had breakfast there the previous day and my juice refills were free!

I do recommend this restaurant, I had a great time with my girlfriend. More details: I liked that my steak was not slathered in sauce and the fried polenta it came with was delicious. The bread pudding was amazing, it was moist and the flavors blended well together. The food is served on cool, dark slate looking plates.

The lighting gave the restaurant a welcoming glow. It was quiet, but not too quiet. The tables were evenly spaced so you're not on top of other customers (which tends to happen in NYC restaurants). I always choose a restaurant during Restaurant Week based on their menu. And Green Fig's menu was outstanding. My mom and I shared all of our courses which is a must during Restaurant Week. We got the Mezze, Tuna Tartare, Osso Busco, Dorade, and Goat Cheese Panna Cotta.

5.0,1/9/2017,"As our last dinner in New York, we decided to keep it beyond local and have dinner at the Green Fig, on the 4th floor of Yotel, which is where we were staying at.  Now the ambiance is really nice and the service is incredible. Seeing that I was going to crawl into bed shortly after dinner (Iceland exhaustion), I went light and went for the fish of the day main course. The fish of the day was dorade, which I had never had before. It was amazing! Served with a pumpkin cream sauce and garbanzo beans, this plate was just incredible! The sauce was honestly heavenly! The dorade was light, with a nice crispness to it.  I honestly can't stop raving about it. Our sever was also fantastic, especially since he sold me on the Dorade. Cute place for a date and the music is also fantastic! Oh and by the by the bar offers $4 mimosas (that was an earlier discovery). Oh and the menu does have a variety to cater to everyone's palate.",8,4,5,Josette S.,"Miami, FL",525,339,2156
3.0,12/27/2016,"If I was allowed to give half points (which I know we are not), I would give them 3.5 starts.It is not always easy find a good restaurant that is open during holidays, with reasonable pricing. We needed a restaurant that offers good food at reasonable price on Thanksgiving day, and although there were several restaurants who were open with special Thanksgiving menu, they were either booked or the Prix Fixe menu was very expensive. Finally, I came across Green Fig, with reasonable Prix Fixe price. They are located at the fourth floor inside Yotel. The elevator of Yotel is super dark, as if we are inside (or going to) night club of some sort... Once we got out of the elevator, we were back in the light, thank goodness. The restaurant was quiet on this Thanksgiving day in the afternoon. The dining area was not too large, but good enough size. Their Prix Fixe for Thanksgiving Day ($42) were three courses, with one appetizer, one main, and one dessert of your choice. Since there were several of us, we got to see and eat most of their offerings. They offer modern Israeli cuisine with influences from countries around it. Therefore, their dishes are made with spices imported from those regions, that provides unique flavors.Food was good and service was very friendly and polite, but slow. The server took our orders without writing it down (I think so that it looks better?) which made it difficult since he had to repeat everyone's order a couple of times until he go it right. And even then, he got few of our orders wrong. Furthermore, it took a while for dishes to comes out, and even when it did, not all of our dishes came out at the same time for everyone. This was not good, we either had to wait for everyone's dishes to come out (while your dish gets cold), or feels guilty eating when someone at your table does not have his/her dish brought out. As I mentioned, each dish had that extra spice, providing flavors from Israel and Middle East, which was both good and not good, based on personal preference. Overall, we had a nice, quiet, relaxing lunch here.",1,0,1,June S.,"New York, NY",212,624,4546
4.0,12/26/2016,"We went here on Chriatmas eve and they were serving a pre-fix that evening. It was a three course pre-fix for $36, which was super affordable for a christmas eve. Here are some highlights of my experience:1) Ambience: Its located on the 4th floor in Yotel with both indoor and outdoor seating. Really nice ambience for a restaurant in this price range. 2) Service: Given it was a christmas eve, they were really understaffed. It took a long time to get our food, but we didnt really mind. The servers were extremely courteous and kept on their smile despite having such a stressful Christmas eve. 3) Food: We didnt have much to chose from given the pre-fix nature of the evening. Unfortunately for us though, they ran out of the entree we were planning on getting and they had to change it for a gnocchi. We were three of us, so we ordered one of each on the prefix menu and had the pleasure of trying everything! The mezze platter and the burrata were really good. The cauliflower which had great reviews was under-seasoned. But after adding a little salt, it tasted really good. For entrees, the pork ribs, the fish and the gnocchi were all done well. 4) Desserts: The desserts were definitely very ordinary and I would recommend skipping it and heading elsewhere for desserts. Overall, I would definitely recommend the place. Its also easy to get reservations, which makes it a perfect spot for last minute planned dinners on busy nights.",0,0,0,Kartik I.,"New York, NY",80,53,41

1.0,10/31/2016,"We have been eating there for 3 days as part of the hotel's breakfast package. The first 2 days everything was good enough. I would not say it was great food, but definitely reasonable for a continental breakfast. The third day there made them loose all of the respect I had for that place, for 2 main reasons : 1. The third morning they insisted we pay for coffee, although it was complementary. After a loud argument with the women calling herself ""the manager"" we decided to pay for whatever she wanted only to tell us on our way out that we can take the money we left back and that she's sorry. Well... When being rude to a customer, even a sorry won't help. 2. This is the main reason. Every breakfast we got a basket of toasted bread. On the third day I noticed that one of the toasts in the basket had a missing piece which was bitten from it. This means that they are reusing food left by other customers. I cannot even describe how disgusting that was! When telling the manager and showing her our findings, she gracefully and very conveniently ignored it! I would definitely recommend to stay away!",1,0,0,Omri S.,"Amsterdam, The Netherlands",0,1,0

When we received the plate, it had only 1 carrot. The waitress told us that we were""fortunate to receive such a long carrot"". The gnocchi had no pasta in it and the mushrooms the portion was less than the size of a fist.The meze only comes with 1 piece of bread no matter how large of a group you come with.

5.0,8/1/2016,"Tough for me to figure out where to start my review from but here it goes..We were celebrating a birthday Brunch with a group of 22 people this past weekend which, you would think, would be difficult to arrange and set up in advance. I was pleasantly surprised with the ease of which I was able to set up the menu (pre fixe) with Kelsey and Sole over email/a call or two. The menu and everything that is included was explained in detail by them.As for the day of, we arrived and (sadly) the weather was not on our side. The table was originally set up inside the restaurant but since we had a large group I approached Gil (the manager) and he was the one that suggested to make room for our large party in the covered terrace portion outside by bringing in tables from uncovered portion, drying them all off, and letting us enjoy the outside without being soaked. Now on to the food and drinks, the unlimited mimosas and watermelon bellinis were a great hit and the food was delicious prepared in a very authentic Mediterranean style that the whole group loved. The dessert, which was a chef's selection was incredible, as well. The attentiveness of the staff to everyone in our party was incredible and the food came out all together for the entire group!Once we finished eating and just continued to hang out for a bit we thought the attentiveness would stop but nope, one of the other managers came over and offered to set up beer pong for us and brought out everything we needed for that. All in all, it was one of the best brunches I have had in the city and I would highly recommend this to anyone looking for a great meal, at a great cost, in the great city of NY!Thank you again, Green Fig!",1,1,1,Uri K.,"Marlboro Township, NJ",154,5,0

The chicken was sooooo tender, which our server has told us it was marinated for 2 days in chicken stock. If you like vegetables, I would recommend the cantine cauliflower with is a bit spicy with green fire sauce. Very delicious. Also, I don't usually eat duck, but their duck was very tasty as well, with some carrot purée, which tasted similar to mashed sweet potatoe. Overall, I would def recommend this place for dinner.

Because I usually sit at the bar or chill on the roof top. This review is based on the bar so I can't really comment on their dinning room. I know what you're thinking, ""It's NYC, why sit in a hotel bar and have drinks?"" Simple answer, I love the atmosphere plus the bartender (Adrian) is extremely friendly. Did I mention he's kinda hot? Haha. But in all seriousness, I really do like the atmosphere. As far as the food, I've tried their pop burgers (pop those suckers right in your mouth) not literally. LOL, fries were thin and crispy, mezze's were good, which they offer a variety. Next time around, I want to try their sea bass. Would I return? Of course.

How is this acceptable?!?Keep in mind the restaurant was virtually empty with only a few tables hosting any patrons... With the exception of our Mezze appetizer, the rest of the food was absolutely horrendous... To the point where many of us had to send our food back... Not just because of the fact that we were beyond frustrated with the service, but for the fact that the food was truly inedible.And to top it all off...

The restaurant has very nice decors, very cool vibe, music were great as well.My fiancé tried to order beers and cocktails, but many drinks on the menu weren't even available, the excuses was, they had a very busy brunch, so they ran out... Our waiter(Brett) wasn't attentive at all, it's hard to track him down, we even asked the host if she can get our waiter for us. Water was not refilled, we had to ask many times to get water.

I've never been to a restaurant, where entrees came out one at a time, about 15-30mins a part!

The food is 3.5 stars. Everything else, 2 stars. Tiny bits and prices are high. Not terribly authentic in flavor either, if you are expecting middle eastern flavors. The worst part of our experience was the wait, and the lack of any communication from the staff in letting us know 2 hours later, where some of the meals were.
