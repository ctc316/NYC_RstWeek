5.0,2/19/2019,"Hearth is the only awesome place I know that follows the Weston A Price and Sally Fallon in their approach to cooking. This means cooking with high quality and clean ingredients - no GMO, organic, local, etc. It also means they use high quality fats - real butter, cook with lard or Galo and not vegetable oils. And of course they do not do a lot of gluten. Even their bread is fermented (sour dough) that removes most of the gluten. Every time we are in NYC we try to come here. We try to cook at home in the same manner so our body and especially our tummies are very happy after a visit here. In our latest trip we came to hearth twice. First we came for Valentine's Day dinner. We did a four course prefix dinner with wine pairing. It was fantastic and romantic. Every meal should start with a little bone broth.",0,0,0,Jose P.,"Washington, DC",12,158,80

2.0,2/13/2019,"I picked Hearth based on location and decent reviews but I wish I would have looked closer. It's lovely looking and rustic on the outside, but when you get inside, the illusion is over. A bit generic inside.Our chilly waitress took our order and out came chicken pate, radish salad, Gemelli pasta and the bunless burger.The pate was good and served on thick, toasted, well buttered bread. Solid!The little lump of radishes they set down on our table was ridiculous looking and they were acrid tasting.My Gemelli pasta was ok, but something was missing. I've read this in other reviews. You just can't put your finger on it.And last but not least my husband's burger was overcooked even though he asked for medium rare.

4.0,1/28/2019,"What's a trip to New York City without a visit to a trendy East Village restaurant? I mean, like really. This place had been buzzed about for its rich Tuscan-inspired menu since 2003, but chef Marco Canora had a health scare a few years back that encouraged him to create dishes that were lighter and more nutritious, starting with the introduction of his popular beef broth chain, Brodo (review: bit.ly/2DSf8Ld). I didn't know about the Brodo connection when my friend Carlos and I dined here on a frigid Sunday evening, but I was pleased since I can't live on Katz's pastrami and Nathan's hot dogs. Can I?There was a warm ambiance the moment we walked in, though the tables were crowded a bit too closely together. We decided to share a $14 bowl of Ribollita, which was part of Canora's Italian culinary legacy that they were kind enough to split into two smaller bowls (photo: bit.ly/2St376R). It was a soothing Tuscan white bean soup mixed with black cabbage, bread crumbs, and Parmesan cheese. An ideal start which led to our shared entree, the $72 Whole Spatchcock Chicken, which granted felt overpriced for such a straightforward treatment (photo: bit.ly/2SefRiF) accompanied by a plate of roasted cabbage, onion, chili, and bacon (photo: bit.ly/2UI2l3r).It was definitely a hearty portion of poultry but honestly not the most succulent I've ever had. For our side dish, we ordered the satisfying $17 Roasted Mushrooms, shiitakes with parsley, garlic, and lemon (photo: bit.ly/2GmLDTf). In order to end our meal of comfort food with an indulgent flourish, we couldn't help ourselves but order the $12 Dark Chocolate Board, which consisted of five pieces for each of us of increasing cacao content (photo: bit.ly/2Srapb9), but the topper was the $7 Two-Bite S'more, which served as the perfect last sweet bite with dark chocolate, marshmallow, and house-made graham crackers (photo: bit.ly/2TulfdO).FOOD - 4 stars...comfort food amped up for foodies with the prices to matchAMBIANCE - 3.5 stars...a warm space but I felt crowded inSERVICE - 3.5 stars...we had at least three servers, our favorite was the one who explained the chocolates with authority and enthusiasm TOTAL - 4 stars...you could do worse in the East VillageRELATED - Looking for other dining options in New York City?

2.0,1/13/2019,"I really wanted to love this place! But it all came down to poor service. Please note I had been about 5 years ago, and haven't returned since because our food came out cold with mediocre flavors.This time upon arrival when we checked in we were told the kitchen had lost electricity, but they still sat us, and just asked that we be mindful of that. OK. We sit. Our waitress brings us our drinks. She returns 10 minutes later to say they can do vegetables. We order one - the one we had planned on if ordering a whole meal - and also ask for the bread. She says they usually grill the bread so doesn't know if they can do it. I say, fine, but if you can that be great. Our beet dish comes. Good flavor, warm beets. No bread. I see lots of bread plates leaving the kitchen. During this 45 minute period, our waitress doesn't come check on us once. I was baffled. At any restaurant shouldn't a server ask how's the food tasting? If she did, I would have asked where the bread was. She also should have updated us on the situation, and maybe suggested we order another dish! Our waters were never refilled either. We ended up leaving not because we didn't think the power would come back on... But because of the horrible service. You lost two live diners because you didn't pay attention Hearth.

Even though my group had no reservation ( in the future I would definitely make one) the host was very accommodating to find a table for us. Our server was excellent, found us a great bottle of wine for the evening that was within our budget and description and was very helpful in answering all of our questions. We started with the garlic bread, a MUST have in my opinion perfectly toasted thick bread with layers of smashed garlic and oil on top *pure heaven* We then ordered the whole chicken and some veggie sides, they offer both a whole chicken and a whole fish for multiple people to share and I think it's a great option for a fun dinning experience. Chicken was moist and tender, our greens cooked perfectly and squashed seasoned very well. For desert my group split the pear cobbler, which featured perfectly cooked fruit and a flavorful oat topping.

4.0,11/8/2018,"Had a great evening At Hearth. Probably one of the few tasting menus/wine pairings that are actually worth it in the city (78pp for food and 56pp for wine). A little different than traditional tastings, my wife and I shared all 12 items instead of single portions which was more intimate. The items are direct from the menu to if there are any items you would not be happy having make sure to make it known! Don't leave it for chance Dinner was served as four tasting courses. Wine was great throughout and the pours were generous for the wine pairing. 1st CourseBeef Tartare: 6/5 by far the best steak tartare we have ever had. The addition of the raw cheddar took it to another level Market Root Vegetables: 4/5 nice and fresh Japanese Sweet Potato: 3/5 just didn't do it for me2nd Course:unfortunately it took forever for the second course to come.

3.0,10/28/2018,"Hearth was okay. My girlfriend and I visited on a Saturday. We started off with drinks. Waiter was nice but didn't seem interested in educating us on the menu (storytelling). I asked for a cocktail and it was okay. Nothing amazing. My girlfriend ordered wine. Didn't like her Pinot Gris because it was too sweet. Waiter promptly brought something else over.For food, we shared. Started off with soups. Ribollita and bone broth. Ribollita was a hearty bean/bread soup. Was okay. Didn't blow me away. Flavors overall were good but it was on the verge of being too salty. Then came the bone broth. Man, that was SUPER salty and way overpriced for what it is. Definitely stay away if you are watching your sodium intake! After we went with the japanese sweet potato on what looked like sour cream (and sort of tasted like it). The waiter didn't seem interested in educating us either. Finally, the last course, was the sea bream. The fish was the star of the evening. Very crispy skin, moist interior, good accompaniments. We finished off with chocolate tasting (5). Would be nice to have a little tag/reference so we know brand to reference back if we wanted to buy. Overall, would not return. Needs to improve service and experience. Menu has this weird overdrawn story told on the back that reminded me of a fast food chain. It mentions something about their frying fat being changed frequently and not having oxidized oils. That statement evokes weird thoughts and is unnecessary.

The waitress was nice to answer some of the questions we had about the menu. She was courteous and helpful. she told us the portion is rather small so we should order at least two per person. We ordered bunch of entrees and appetizers and a bottle of wine. We ordered dessert later too. I couldn't take pictures of all the food that we ordered but I've attached some pictures. The two stars in giving all come from the service. I was really disappointed at the food. I can't say too much about the portion because we were warned about it, but the price really doesn't justify the taste and quality of the dishes. The gnocchi which had the best review out of the yelp reviews I can find... was mediocre at best. Meatball, pasta, tartare, garlic bread, donut, some kind of peach cake, etc. all subpar.

The pâté came covered in a really sweet jelly that made for a nauseating blend with the umami of the pâté. It was barely edible. The rabbit rillettes was a bit better, but it was very oily and we found several bones. Our service was inconsistent and one of our several waiters was brusque with us. The wine was mediocre and this whole disappointing experience cost the two of us just shy of $100.

The hostess was lovely  and waitress very nice (or I wouldn't have added another star). I had remembered their meatballs were a signature dish and my boyfriend typically loves steak tartare. Our food came out almost too quickly (barely had a sip of my drink). My meatballs were slightly burned and unbelievably salty (and I'm a salt lover). Not to mention, it's 3 average size meatballs for $24 (no side included and bread is an additional cost). I'm willing to pay for something really good...these were barely edible but I hadn't eaten for hours so I muscled through. Then, my boyfriend's $18 steak tartare came out and was served in a small cereal bowl with potato chips on top. My boyfriend, like me, ate the tiny mess begrudgingly. In sum, 2x drinks and 2x small barely edible dishes cost us $75...$90 with tip (we didn't want to punish the server). Won't be back unfortunately, ever.",1,0,0,Charity S.,"Manhattan, NY",1,24,3

The smell is overwhelmingly amazing. It just  make you want to eat whatever they are cooking. And as a bonus you learn a thing or two.We ordered a good montepulciano to start and we were all set to rock on our order. Sea bass crudo, steak tartare, macaroni with pork ragu, potato gnocchi. Ah we saw the polenta coming out, so we had to get one of those as well. All was fantastic but I have to give 5 stars to the gnocchi.

One of the servers came immediately and gave us all water and copies of the menu, then left us for some time. We decided on a couple of appetizers to share, including radishes with strawberries, and some vegetable appetizers. The vegetable appetizers were mediocre, and the strawberries with radishes were particularly bad. The combination just didn't go together. The pasta looked like it was good but on tasting, there seemed like something was missing to make it really great. All of our party agreed that the food was not great.

2.0,8/4/2018,"Restaurant Week (Summer 2018) Review:I wanted to like Hearth - it's been on my 'to-dine' list and all, but at least far as their Restaurant Week offerings went...well, I was looking for a bit more.The service was generally fine, and I felt like myself and my dining partner\were we attended to.  I opted to start pre-gaming elsewhere given the  pricey, elevated cocktail prices ($15 per, or you could opt for the $24 wine tasting menu...which is more expensive than some of the more ritzy venues charging $15-$20. For the appetizer/1st course, I opted for the marinated calamari with summer vegetables, pickled red onion, potato, basil. This was probably my favorite dish of the night, decent amount of calamari and was well-dressed.Mains:  Opted to split  the Halibut and the Meatball entrees. The halibut was increeeeedibly incredibly salty. And I like my seasoning...but this was jarringly salty. I contemplated sending it back, but for expediency's sake, just suffered in lip-smacking silence.  The meatballs were tasty, but the polenta was rather bland for being built up as ""cacio e pepe"" style. We also ordered a side of their signature potato gnocchi with sage and brown butter - I mean, fine...but for $16 as a side, like the rest of the meal...disappointing.For dessert, we split the Stella's Pudding and the Peaches & Cream. The pudding was rich and flavorful  for sure, and the difference in texture between all the layers made this rather surprisingly yummy. I only tasted a bit of the peaches & creamed, but seemed light and delightful.I've wanted to hit up Hearth for a while. I'm not sure if it was an off night, or maybe the signature dishes weren't featured during Restaurant Week, and I really wanted to like Hearth after all the acclaim and build-up...but , at least after this first visit, I'm left a bit miffed, underwhelming, wanting, and rather disappointed in my restaurant week outing.",1,1,0,Steve L.,"New York, NY",157,309,1204
4.0,7/28/2018,"Went here with some friends to grab a bite to eat for dinner on a Friday night. We made a reservation and the place was pretty crowded, but it never quite hit capacity.We were all very hungry, so we decided to split a few dishes:Garlic bread (3 stars): I was hoping this would be super garlicky and hit high flavor marks, but it was a bit underwhelming.Fava bean salad (4 stars): This was actually one of my favorite dishes of the night as the salad was super fresh and quite tasty on top of the grilled bread.Smashes cucumbers (4 stars): This was one of the specials of the night and was a quite refreshing and flavorful starter.Monkfish (4 stars): This was a well-cooked dish that was a decent size. The black garlic and broth really came together well with the fish.Pork milanese (4 stars): This was another one of my favorite dishes of the night as it was cooked perfectly and had a nice texture and flavor with the garlic breadcrumbs. Whole grain maccheroni (3.5 stars): The ragu was very good--but the dish seemed pretty one-dimensional overall.Old-fashioned donuts (3.5 stars): This dessert was decent, but nothing to write home about. A decent size to split, but nothing you definitely have to order.Overall, this place served up some super fresh and tasty food. While nothing really blew us away flavor-wise, everything was quite solid and was well-balanced. The service was friendly and attentive and the chilled pinot that we shared at the table was quite pleasant.

4.0,7/28/2018,"This was our second time going to Hearth for restaurant week. Some of the menu items were new, and some were Hearth staples we were happy to taste again.Starting off, they offer a complimentary smoothie shooter, which is always refreshing and pleasantly delicious. They put some sort of yogurt in the middle and it's a great way to start the meal.Since I went with 2 other people this time, we were able to try one of everything on the restaurant week menu.First course:Everything in the first course was amazing. The fennel salad was so flavorful and large. The calamari was cooked in a yummy pesto type sauce (not fried!) Lastly, the gazpacho was incredible. It was more like a soup, but it was my favorite out of all three.Main course:2 out of 3 of these were good. The meatballs we had at last year's restaurant week, and it's amazing. The ricotta cheese mixes so well and it tastes like quality meat. The gnocchi was also very tasty, but it didn't taste like gnocchi. It was more firm, without cheese in the middle. Dessert:Again, 2 out of 3. Stella's Pudding was rich with a chocolate coffee flavor and a crispy top. Loved it. The Peach Shortcake too was amazing, and it was not what I expected! It was so light, SO good. The Providence Pecorino, however, was NOT good. The bread was completely burned, and tasted almost old. Plus, it only comes with a bit of jam and some cheese: a lackluster dish.All in all, definitely give this restaurant a try.

Hearth also offers an extensive wine list including large magnums of wine which are well suited for groups on a price-per-person basis.My first time having dinner here we were presented with a box full of artisan chocolates to choose from (on the house) as a dessert.

Not too loud, not too scene-y, just good food and good service.The menu here has tons of options and having tried quite a few dishes, I think the veggies here trump the meats. Favorites include the buckwheat gemelli with mushrooms (so rich and flavorful), the gnocchi, the garlic bread (sooooo buttery), and the purple kale sprouts (describing it wouldn't do it justice, it's such a lovely vegetable preparation you just have to try it). On the meat side, the calamari and broth are solid, and the ricotta meatballs are only okay. The service is really good here. The waitresses are super knowledgeable about the menu and helpful, and not too pushy. The dining style is more sharing-oriented and the food comes at a good pace so you can enjoy every dish.

I feel like I've become accustomed to paying a good amount of money for pretty good food in NYC, but hearth is a different story. You must get the pork Ragu dish as well as the roasted lamb. These dishes alone were enough to seal the deal. Some honorable mentions include the polenta, tartar, and the bread (they had run out of garlic bread by the time we arrived but I assume that means it's probably Even better than the bread... ridiculous!).

(Not sure why, I've been to plenty of restaurants with chefs tables and can always reserve these fun seats that overlooks the kitchen) That was my only disappointment in booking a seat.  They could have easily become complacent and the quality would have suffered but not here, it was like a well oiled machine from the food to the service. I would highly recommend Hearth for a nice dinner to a romantic evening to just a casual night out. The restaurant was dimly lit and I really enjoyed the comfy and relaxed atmosphere.We did the tasting which is 12 dishes for $78 per person. 4 apps, 2 pastas, 4 entrees, and 2 desserts.  It felt more like a tapas style when they bring you all the courses together.  The food was delicious.

The food was fairly tasty, however the chef had a heavy hand with the salt. The mushrooms were so salty that they had to be taken away and refunded. However, they compensated by giving us wine. Next came the horror. I went to go to the bathroom on the first floor and it was occupied. So I waited for 5 mins until some lady approached me. She was homeless and very jittery. We continued waiting until I was informed about the downstairs bathroom. I knocked and heard, ""ONE MINUTE!!!"" It was the homeless woman's husband. After waiting for 2-3 mins, she came down and yelled at him to leave. After another 5 mins, they left leaving a long line at the bathroom and a bathroom smelling a homeless man and feces. Afterwards, we were given chocolates but this might be normal. Overall, this place needs to buff up their security and be less heavy handed.

The cauliflower was in a light and salty olive oil, white wine and lemon, and the mushrooms were rich and hearty - both delicious!

I would highly recommend Hearth for a bday dinner to a romantic evening to just a casual night out. The restaurant was dimly lit and I really enjoyed the comfy and relaxed atmosphere. Chef Canora, I have heard of you for a long time and I am glad that the restaurant was crowded on the Thursday night that my group went and I am glad that the dinner was as fantastic as it was.The food: Potato Gnocchi- Sage butter, parm. Oh my goodness was this dish good! This was one of the favs of the table and it was so damn good. It was a homemade gnocchi and it was so perfectly light and cheesy. Drool. yelp.com/user_local_phot…Chicken Liver Pate- Shallot & cranberry agrodolce, grilled bread. I enjoyed the pate, the pate itself had good flavor but I really loved the super smooth texture of the pate and the bread that they used, I think it was made in house, was excellent. The bread paired so incredibly well with the pate. yelp.com/user_local_phot…Mushroom Trifolati- Gremolata. The mushroom dish does come off a bit simple but wow, were these mushrooms cooked perfectly. I really enjoyed the mushroom combination that they used. yelp.com/user_local_phot…Grass-Fed Beef Tartare- Pecorino, salsa verde, potato chips. I really enjoyed the flavor of the tartare but I did find the dish to run a bit salty. I also thought the big hunks of pecorino were a bit too intense in flavor, they kinda felt like cheese bombs going off in my mouth. The idea of using potato chips is something I have never seen in a beef tartare before and honestly, I am not sure if the potato chips were a good choice. yelp.com/user_local_phot…Whole Roasted Fish of the Day- Roasted potatoes, fennel, red onions. This was a large portion dish and the fish of the day was Black Cod. The Black Cod was cooked perfectly, the cod came out super moist and flavorful. I really loved the roasted potatoes since the potatoes had a nice crunch, the fennel was cooked really well to the point that they came sweet. yelp.com/user_local_phot…Garlic Bread- Grass-fed butter, garlic, lemon, parsley. This was the only dish I didn't care for, and it was the one that I thought was going to be a easy homerun. My friend Liz L, thought it was a good idea to order it since she likes to over order and the dish came out weird. The homemade bread was nice but the dish came off very lemony without a good garlic flavor. You could smell the garlic but the flavor was not there. yelp.com/user_local_phot…Apple Cider Doughnuts- Apple butter, crème fraîche. The doughnuts were heaven!.

2.0,2/5/2018,"I was looking forward to eating here - been wanting to go here for years - unfortunately, I was disappointed with the food - too salty !!  - the soup was too salty  - my entree was the skate which I enjoyed but, once again too salty. Does the young kitchen staff ever taste the food they produce ? Just a little less salt & the soup & entree would have been okay. Instead, I needed more water because of the salt intake. Seasoning is so basic & fundamental  - yet so difficult to execute well ! So frustrating because I wanted to like my dinner more. The dessert course took so long to be served - our waitress apologized. The table next to us got their desserts in a timely manner but, I guess because it was Restaurant Week - the kitchen couldn't handle it (that was what the waitress was implying). But, I don't think this is the first year this place has participated in Restaurant Week - hope they improve their food & their kitchen needs to be more organized & efficient - can't thrive on last glories Hearth !  I want to give this place another try - perhaps, for brunch in the future (& not during Restaurant Week !).",0,0,0,Lily Y.,"Woodside, NY",69,5,20
4.0,2/4/2018,"At 6pm Friday night of Restaurant Week Hearth was already bustling.  We were there to celebrate a family birthday but didn't make mention of it except for quiet chatter among our party of 5, including our 11-yr. old foodie grandson.  The night was bitter cold and it was wonderful to feel the warmth of Hearth immediately.  Our round table was generous and comfortable and our server, Laura, was the essence of balance .... professional and efficient, yet warm and caring.  In fact she noticed us giving a birthday toast when our wine arrived and at the end of dinner she placed a  candle in our birthday gal's outstanding dark chocolate pudding dessert.   Food here has a touch of simple elegance and bold freshness that again implies balance.  My lentil soup starter erased any thoughts of the frosty weather outside.  The lentils and vegetables  were perfectly cooked with a sturdy yet creamy texture.  It  was perfect.  We ordered garlic bread for the table and then put in for a second order of the same.  Yes it was that good!  We all ordered the Restaurant Week menu and were pleased by its offerings.  Those who ordered the pork bellies with fennel appetizer swooned over it!  We all enjoyed our main courses also.  I went for Skate Wing served with creamy potatoes and delicious vegetables.  Others ordered the beef with ricotta meatballs and loved it. The very complex chocolate pudding dessert I mentioned above was something  to go back to Hearth for again and again. Layers of pudding and toffee and salted nuts gave texture and surprises to each delicious taste.  I look forward to another visit to Hearth as soon as it gets a little lighter outside so that the restaurant will be a little brighter inside.  I am finding a trend in many restaurants lately to go dark,.  I like to be able to see the art and beauty of the food on the plate before I taste it and at many restaurants I am having a little difficulty with lighting.  Oh and by the way may I suggest you take a look at the wine menu before going to Hearth as it is quite long and all encompassing.  I found 4 wines on the list that I thought we would enjoy and I gave my list to our server who in turn went to the wine steward and within minutes an excellent Bottle of Bardolino arrived.  Cheers to Hearth!",0,0,0,Judith J.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,2,0

The soup was hearty and delicious. The pasta was good, nothing mind blowing, but made with love and good quality ingredients. Great sauce.  I added the gnocchi and regretted it. I had expected the pasta dish portion to be smaller so it was way too much food. Don't get me wrong, I ate it all, but it wasn't necessary and it wasn't great. The sauce was too watery and the gnocchi was almost too mushy. But I can't not eat gnocchi that is in front of me, even only okay gnocchi.  I am giving 4 instead of 5 stars because I had sticky toffee cake twice this month and Cookshop's blew Hearth's out of the water. Hearth's was borderline dry for my taste. I expect my sticky toffee cake to melt in my mouth. (That being said it was still good, just not amazing.) The gnocchi didn't wow me and none of the flavor combinations really surprised me.  They were well executed though.

5.0,1/21/2018,"My boyfriend and I spontaneously walked into Hearth for a Friday date-night dinner and have to admit that this may be our new favorite place on the lower east side. The restaurant was perfectly filled enough to be able to have a conversation with out yelling across the table. The ambiance is full of warmth and the bar when you walk in still has a trendy feel.  There are also convenient high top tables on the side if you weren't able to snag a table.If you haven't discovered orange wine yet, I highly recommend you try it here. Hearth has a passionate sommelier who will give you her honest opinion and not just sell you the most expensive bottle. They have a large selection of orange wines which is difficult to come by. We tried a bottle of the Catarratto 2014 Sicily which fell on the lighter side of a spectrum between blood orange and lightly pigmented orange. It had a bit of a tropical hint and went down smoothly with the meal.Our meal began with a complimentary winter squash + lentil soup that had light lemon yogurt drizzle. The portions are meant to serve two or more so my boyfriend and I chose to order the braised short rib with sliced carrots and red wine, the potato gnocchi with sage butter and parm, and of course the garlic bread.

3.0,1/4/2018,"We did the prefix 12-course dinner as a our splurge night in the Big Apple. The restaurant was highly recommended and we are always up for checking out a James Beard winner (Chef was voted best NYC chef in 2017). For dinner, it was fun to enjoy seasonal produce (winter). So lots of root vegetables, cabbage, pears, and apples. We had 3 vegetable dishes to start, followed by two pasta dishes, followed by two protein dishes (one fish, one chicken), and finished off with two delicious desserts (and best dishes of the night!). The bread was considered a course which we thought was interesting. The food was good but wasn't amazing. The stars of the night were definitely the chicken and two desserts (apple cider donuts and chocolate layered mousse). Personally, I think the dinner was a bit expensive for what it was but the nice thing about prefix dinners is that you don't have to make any decisions and are always excited to see what comes out next from the kitchen. Come with an open mind and hungry! It's a lot of food!Service was sub-par but not sure if it was east coast hospitality (a little cool and passive aggressive).

3.0,1/4/2018,Came here to end 2017 with a delicious meal and this place didn't really meet up to expectations. We ordered from their New Years Eve menu since that was the only option. It was $88 for 4 courses and on a regular day it's usually $80 for 7 courses.The first course was the best course of the 4 and it was the soup and the beef tartare. Everything was well seasoned and balanced. As the next two courses arrived we were disappointed to find that the food was overly salty from the risotto to the scallops and chicken. I did appreciate that there were 5 scallops in the 3rd course since most places will only have 3 scallops in their dish. The last dish was dessert and I got the apple tart which i didn't even finish. The puff pastry was not flaky and seemed stale like it's been sitting out for over a day. Although the ambiance and service was amazing and deserves a star on its own the food fell short and was only 2 stars for me.,2,0,0,Jessica C.,"Queens, NY",143,257,170
3.0,1/3/2018,"Came to Hearth as a party of three to have the NYE prix fixe 4 course dinner. After researching a few locations with NYE prix fixe dinner, we decided on this $88/pp farm to table menu with a little bit of everything we liked. We really thought we would love Hearth, but the food was disappointing and not worth the price. The food is probably a 2.5 stars but the service from our lovely waitress is a plus. For starters, we ordered the Japanese Sweet Potato Soup and Grass-Fed Beef Tartare. We all agreed this was probably the best out of all the food we had that night. The sweet potato soup was rich and creamy paired with a dollop of labneh, and sprinkled with some pickled cauliflower and horseradish (I enjoyed the acidity though my friend was not a big fan). The flavors worked well together and was very satisfying for a cold night. My friend ordered the beef tartare with raw cheddar, salsa verde, topped with some potato chips. It was plated in sort of a loose salad-style instead of the usual packed-together presentation. No complaints for our appetizers!For our mid course, the three of us got all the options. I chose the Whole Grain Tagliatelle with wild mushrooms and fontina fonduta. This pasta dish is heavy and filling. Very delicious on the first bite but the saltiness of the cheese sauce is just too much after three bites. I found it difficult to finish the dish. We also knew it was a problem when we had to chase our food with water constantly. Yikes.For my main course, I decided to get the Smoked Chicken Breast with sunchoke, kale and cranberry. I liked the smokiness and tenderness of the chicken breast, which was well seasoned on its own. The kale, sunchoke and the juices at the bottom of my plate was very salty. I had to leave all the kale behind because they were just soaked and super salty. The pieces of potato chips on top added a nice touch of crunchiness and helped with the overall salty dish. My friends got the Roasted Sea Scallops, which I preferred over my smoked chicken breast. There was a generous portion of sea scallops and all 5 of them were well-seared and meaty. However, it was still too salty for our taste. These would have been great dishes if not for the over seasoning.Last but not least, dessert. We got the Apple Tarte Tatin and Stella's Pudding. The Apple Tarte Tatin's rum raisin caramel flavor was delicious, but the pastry was a letdown. My friend and I both struggled so much with the pastry which was chewy and hard to cut into with our spoons and forks. The candied cocoa nibs on top of the pudding was difficult to eat and rock solid. Really not satisfied with the meal we had that night and expected more considering the price. It's a shame because the restaurant is beautiful and has great ambiance for dinner.",1,0,0,Crystal Z.,"Elmhurst, NY",340,175,334

The food was delectable with my favorite being the scallops.Left tender and seasoned so well making the most of the buttery texture the scallops already possessed.

A plate of mushroom was like $18 and it came with no sides. No rice or other veggies.literally just mishrooms. The meatballs were $18 and it was 3 meatballs with no pasta or potatoes or rice. Just meatballs. The menu is expensive and the portion is terrible for the price. But the food tastes really good. The servers work together. Random servers walking by us  would clear our table. Everything came out at an efficient time. We decided to go to venieros for dessert and grabbed some food from a food truck because we were still hungry. It's like a hipster place. New and cool concept. Health concious. But there isn't anything that would bring me back to this place mostly because I'm an eater and I don't mind paying more for good quality but when you're paying more than $15 for one tiny meal and it's literally just mushrooms thats a little but more than pricey, for me because I needed a little more food.

5.0,12/27/2017,"Marco, oh how I love thy.This is the FAVORITE place to snuggle up for a late dinner. The food is all farm to table, locally sourced and when a menu item is out, it is OUT! Personally, this reviewer loves that they support zero-waste in the kitchen. All staff is joyful and behave like a family with good vibes and sassy jokes being thrown 'round- All the whilst staying absolutely professional and providing the highest level of table service. The ambiance is magnetic, dimly lit to create privacy but with enough low-hanging antique lights to read the delightfully decorated menu. It would be fitting that Hear would be a loud restaurant, however as this yelper is quite sensitive to such things, I noticed that was a fine balance between the chatter of other patrons, the clink of silverware on plates and the piped in house music playing.Be prepared for a meal landing a bit on the long end, however, you will never feel forgotten about or unattended. Merely the staff at Hearth understands the delicate nature of timing, not too rushed but allowing space. Granted this is all if one makes a reservation 48 hours in advance. Otherwise, the walk-in wait time can be upwards of 2 hours, making it feasible for walk-in patrons to catch one of the many independent- plays, all while waiting for a table for 2 at Hearth. Marco, the owner of this decade-plus neighborhood gem makes you feel as warm as his restaurants' signature bone broth soup, being positively a warm teddy bear himself! On the nights that he pops, he will make you feel as comfortable as being in his own dining room, home food, and all.Infrequent visitors to NYC wouldn't appreciate how much of a treasure this place is, but I have and would bring my parents here.Couldn't recommend this place more, but seriously, make reservations.",0,0,0,Amanda Z.,"Midtown West, Manhattan, NY",7,12,6
5.0,12/27/2017,"After reviewing the menu, four of us decided to make our own tasting menu for dinner. We started with the Ribollita and Hearth broth. (After all, as my friend pointed out-it is the Hearth broth-so it must be good!). And it all was.  To call the Ribollita a white bean soup is an injustice. It was an amazing combination of flavors.  It was so thick it was barely soup.  The Hearth broth was delicate and incredibly flavorful.  My favorite was the Ribollita.We went on to have the mushroom trifolati,  the purple sweet potatoes and the garlic bread. I didn't know garlic bread could be do good. The touch of lemon with the garlic was over the top good.  The purple sweet potatoes were also a surprising burst of flavors.  Each dish was as good, if not better, then the last. We also shared the meatballs and the roasted black bass. The food was all so outstanding, that if I had to pick one dish to pass on, it would have been the meatballs.  While very good, the other dishes outshined then. The roasted black bass was another over the top dish.  It was the perfect blend of flavors with little apple balls (which looked like pasta,) that were the perfect burst of flavor to compliment the fish and the sauce without overpowering them.  If I had to pick a favorite (as difficult as it is), the gnocchi was heavenly. I don't know that I have ever felt like gnocchi was melting in my mouth. The sage butter was amazing and I could have eaten it all night.  Yum!We had wine with dinner- was so focused on food, I don't remember what was drank, although we did have two bottles. Topped off dinner with the apple cider donuts.  OMG!  We had to try because the presentation was so great. Tasted as good as it looked.  Again the combination of flavors was masterful. Waitstaff was very attentive and love when they remember that I don't like ice in my water. Just shows they pay attention to details.

3.0,12/21/2017,"I have been going to Hearth for my birthday for the last 4 years.  This time I was quite disappointed with the service and some of the food.  The waiter spoke only to my husband and neglected to explain anything about the food to us.  We ordered many interesting appetizers and some were good  and others had flavor combinations that did not work.  If the waiter had  made some insightful recommendations  we could have had better luck.  The main dish that I picked was ham and it turned out to be unusual and not to my liking.  Again, If the waiter had discussed the content of the food and its preparation, I would not have ordered it.  I felt that the waiter was only concerned about the fact that I picked an appetizer for dinner and was not spending what my family was spending on their entrees. In the past , what I liked most about Hearth was that the  staff  was smart and knowledgeable about food and wine.  After my last dining experience I am sad to say that I don't feel that way and I will not return.",0,0,0,Josee B.,"Manhattan, NY",0,2,0

Bone marrow was less than average. The $28 Black Sea bass was actually very good. Wish there was more of it. Gnocchi and steak tartare was pretty amateur.

I can confidently say that we didn't waste a New York meal here; the drinks were something else, and the food was truly superb. It's a little pricey, but if you're complaining about the price of an upscale restaurant in NYC, you need to get a new hobby. The cocktail I had was excellent, and all of the dishes we ordered were superb. The standouts were the mushrooms, the gnocchi, and the Japanese sweet potato. Our waitress was extremely helpful in guiding our selection of the food; she recommended the mushrooms as a sort of pairing dish for the gnocchi (she wasn't wrong; the combination worked beautifully). I also greatly appreciated the ambiance of the restaurant. It was on the darker side, but in a cozy way.

3.0,7/31/2017,"3.5 stars. Man, I really wanted to love Hearth. Healthy menu, emphasis on vegetables, lots of good sharing options. But it was just okay. Considering its popularity and its prices, I expected a bit more. Some dishes hit the mark, but most were just a little off in some way. Nothing egregiously bad, but nothing standout. As expected, the vegetables--though kind of sloppily done at times--were the highlight of the night. Proteins were decent but fell short of expectations. Definitely still good enough to give it a second chance, though.Came here at 8:30 on a Friday night with my parents. The space itself is beautiful. Fairly spacious but still warm and intimate. Lighting was bordering on too dim. Pretty versatile spot--viable for a meal with family, a group of friends or date. If you're health-conscious like I am, this worthy of looking into. Hearth makes a point of using local, seasonal and fresh ingredients with high-quality meats (from farms that treat their animals WELL) and sources of fat. Definitely a philosophy I can get behind. Sadly, I'm not drinking alcohol these days. It's temporary, but still upsetting. That said, I can still highly suggest ordering some drinks while you're here, if my parents' experience is anything to go by. My dad with cocktails for the evening. They had a special cocktail this night with some kind of cutesy name, which enjoyed very much. My mom went with the Riesling flight that Hearth offers (the only flight available here), which she also enjoyed. Serious bang for your buck here--pours here are very generous. Most wine I've ever seen distributed in a flight. My dad also ordered a glass of red as our food started arriving, which was also filled graciously. Take note of this!Our waiter, though friendly, was a bit off-putting. He roasted me for not ordering alcohol and he roasted us for not getting dessert. A little humor/banter is usually fun and I totally take part in that kind of thing most of the time, but he was making it uncomfortable most of the time. We knew what we wanted and didn't need to be shamed for wanting something else. It made me a bit squirmy. Personality is better than no personality but only to a certain degree.Food-wise, we went the sharing route. Most of the dishes on the menu are geared toward sharing--even the entrees are on the smaller side (other than the dishes specifically label as being for multiple people). As I mentioned before, Hearth is vegetable-forward and the largest section of its menu is dedicated to them. Though a bit sloppily done, they were still the highlight of the meal for us. Eats, below:Beet salad w/ seaweed, amaranth, yogurt: B+Kind of discordant, though everything kind of bled into each other. Flavors were good but execution was just okay. Amaranth and seaweed didn't really serve a purpose. Seemed like the proportions were off.Smashed cucumbers w/ turmeric yogurt, garlic, poppy seeds: A-One of the better dishes of the night. Again, sloppily prepared (though ""smashed"" might allude to that), but the cucumbers were fresh and yummy. Poppy seeds added some nice extra crunch. Yogurt and cucumber are a great combo so nothing to scoff at there. Warm summer vegetables w/ pickled onion, potato, basil: B+/A-These came highly recommended and though the flavors were good, I wasn't too impressed. The portion was quite small and I honestly felt like I could've sauteed up some veggies to make this exact dish (if you look at the picture you'll see what I mean). A little too much oil for my liking, overpowered the veggies which were themselves tasty. Smoked Bluefish w/ corn, potato, clam: BMy parents enjoyed the bluefish but it was flavorless to me. I'm not sure what was happening with my tastebuds here. I had the highest hopes for this dish so perhaps that was part of it. The corn/potato portion was decent but that's not the star I was looking for.Roasted chicken for 2: A-Chimichurri was delicious, as was the jus. The chicken itself, similar to the fish, was lacking seasoning. I know that's what the chimichurri is supposed to help with (the lemons served on the side helped too) but when you get a solid serving of roasted chicken, I expected some flavor on its own. That said, the sauces/accompaniments were delicious and hit the mark the most as far as flavor profiles were concerned for the night.Overall, a few adjustments could've pushed this over the threshold into four-star territory. Perhaps next time!",9,3,4,Molly T.,"New York, NY",887,464,1480

The restaurant week menu was a good deal for the meal. The prices here are moderate and the $42 prix fixe probably only saves you about $5-7, but I could be wrong. Still it's a very good value for the money spent. Some restaurant week menus give shitty Restaurant Week portions, Hearth is using Restaurant Week as an opportunity to entice voyeurs to become repeat customers. I will be joining the ranks of the regulars here.First off the service was great. Our server Jacqy was fantastic. We started with fermented Hearth bread with whipped lard, butter and EVOO. It is a very good ""appetizer"". The whipped lard had roasted rosemary and was very flavorful. I had the Calamari over a white bean puree. The purée was substantial and served as the perfect starchy base for the calamari sauce. I then had the ricotta meatballs with the Polenta. Polenta was fantastic. Finally had the chocolate pudding, which was layered with a thick fresh whipped cream and crispy devil's food cake. The cake was not too sweet and it was delicious. I left feeling VERY full.

4.0,7/26/2017,"To kick off restaurant week for Summer 2017 in NYC, my girlfriend and I decided to dine at Hearth. We have heard great things about them and have been dying to try it. Restaurant week makes the perfect opportunities for the amazing deals that it offers. Hearth is a sizable restaurant located in the LES. They offer seating options for both inside and outside. I decided on dining outside as it was a little cold last night. The decor of the restaurant is very rustic but minimalistic and their minimalistic menu aligns with that vibe.During restaurant week, diners get an opportunity to try 1 appetizer, 1 main, and 1 dessert.Appetizer- For the appetizer I went with the marinated calamari. The calamari comes grilled and stacked on top of whipped pole beans and chick peas. The dish itself was very tasty. The beans and chick peas had a texture similar to grits and when combined with the calamari made it absolutely to die for. The calamari also tasted very fresh and delicious.Main- For the main I went with the Beef and Ricotta Meatballs. The meatball comes with 2 and is served on top of house milled polenta. The polenta reminds me a lot of grits as well. I was not a huge fan of the polenta but the meatballs were absolutely delicious. The beef was very well seasoned and every bite had me coming back for more.Dessert- For dessert I went with Stella's Pudding and holy smokes was it good. The pudding is a combination of chocolate pudding, devil's food cake, mascarpone, and hazelnut crunch. Each bite was so heavenly and had me coming back for more again and again. I told myself to stop but when I looked down it was all gone.Overall, I had a great dining experience. Hearth was a perfect spot to kick off the summer restaurant week. I will definitely be back in the future to dine with their regular menu.",3,0,0,Peter L.,"Jersey City, NJ",215,124,174
1.0,7/16/2017,What a disappointment. I used to love this spot. This restaurant is a shadow of its former self. I will say cocktails at the bar were good- sadly all was downhill after that. Our waiter seemed annoyed at our very existence. Affected to say the least. That alone can taint the taste of good food. Plates came out quickly were ok until the fish. It smelt bad- both of us agreed. But it's summer in NY and we were both willing to be understanding. When we brought it to the attention of the waiter he almost dismissed it- when we asked if we could speak to the manager none ever came.,0,0,0,Anatracey H.,"Miami Beach, FL",0,3,0
1.0,7/13/2017,"My husband took me to this place for my birthday. He chose this place based on the good reviews. We ordered the tasting menu that's $75 per person. The ingredients looked fresh so we are not sure why they had to pickle all the vegetables. We had pickled cucumber salad, pickled Swiss chard, and pickled cauliflower. We couldn't really taste the natural sweetness or flavor of the vegetables.The pasta dishes and polenta were good. The protein dishes were ok. The steak was nicely cooked but it was extremely salty. It was not a good cut so they plated the steak under mixed vegetables. The cod was good but it was served with a puree or vegetables that also tasted sour.We are not professional food critics and we don't eat out a lot. We just prefer food with more balanced flavors. All we remember from this dinner was that almost everything tasted unbearably sour or salty.",1,0,0,Yan C.,"Manhattan, NY",0,10,0

So I came for brunch this weekend with the BF and was super excited to finally give it a try.We ordered and shared the Zucchini Bruschetta appetizer, which was by far the best part of our meal. So creamy and flavorful, I definitely recommend. However the entrees weren't impressive. I got the Grilled Ham and Cheese, which was okay but the rye bread was overly toasted. There was also no condiments on the sandwich aside from Dijon mustard on the side, so would have been nice to have some sort of sauce on there. My BF got the Beef Hash, which was decent but nothing special. Overall, it's a cute spot but I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here.",3,1,1,Emily C.,"New York, NY",755,103,20

5.0,7/6/2017,"The short version: Happened upon it by accident, super glad I did. Sweetest server ever, ambiance is perfectly moody, and the food was on point (roasted cod, charred snap peas, peach tart, glass of aboriño). It gets harder and harder for me to be impressed by good food, but this place killed it. Did I mention they're incredibly committed to ethically sourcing their food? And they actually seem to know what they're talking about (aka they know ""organic"" does not automatically mean it's good to go). 10/10 would recommend.The long version: Randomly craved seafood so badly that I didn't care if I ate alone. The other place I wanted to go to was packed, so I just started walking home when I passed Hearth. Roasted cod was on the menu, so bingo! Good enough for me. Stepping in was the best decision I've made all week. The short list:1. I was given a small glass (think ""double shot"") of really interesting soup to whet my appetite. They do this with different soups year-round, apparently = +1 cool points.2. Tara (?) was incredibly sweet and patient and recommended an excellent wine for me. (I've definitely had servers just recommend the two or three most expensive wines on the list before at other places so I tend to take things with a grain of salt, but the one she recommended most highly was at the second to lowest price point, so I knew she was being genuine--it's the little things, you know?).3. I had no idea, but turns out their head chef, Marco Canora won the James Beard award this year for Best Chef in NYC (!)4. Not only was their food very tasty, it was very creative, as well. The cilantro-pea-and-some-other-things puree was a really pleasant surprise party in my mouth. 5. Usually, something like a peach tart might come out with a scoop of ice cream or whipped cream, but theirs was balanced excellently with a creme fraiche, making the whole dish not too sweet or heavy.On the whole, I'll DEFINITELY be coming back with a friend or two.

I chose Hearth because it looked delicious, reasonable and I really really deeply wanted to try their inventive sounding tasting menu/drink tasting!I called /emailed the restaurant to set up reservations a few weeks before and let them know of dietary restrictions ahead of time for my aunt (vegetarian and sososososo picky she does NOT usually agree to tasting menus) and my foodie sister who is deathly allergic to tree nuts, peanuts, sesame seeds-- such a restriction usually makes eating out nightmarish for her. We figured they could make sure a few dishes were nut free to order a la carted apart from the tasting menu. My sister never EVER thought she would be so lucky to eat an entire 12 course meal worry-free! They crafted? Adapted? An entire nut free menu. And the staff was so patient when she still needed piece of mind and felt to ask again, even when it got busier in the restaurant. The fact that we didn't realize where nuts might have ""been missing"" too is a testimony to the skills of the chef. And maybe it helped it was the earliest reservation on a Wednesday night? A time when the staff may not have been stretched to their limit. But maybe it didn't matter?My picky Aunt is buying their cookbook, along with my sister and my boyfriends mom.

She was a little on the hungover side so we unexpectedly made this a little boozy and got their bloody marys. I guess they have beef broth from Brodo (the broth shop located next door) which was a little unappealing at first, but it ended up being extremely refreshing, and I think all of the vitamins and minerals from the broth were rejuvenating for my friend. For food, I got the mash which was a braised beef, assorted vegetables, and potatoes topped with fried eggs, and a green sauce. I sometimes get nervous about braised beef because it can be really heavy but this one was fresh and juicy. My friend got the scrambled eggs and greens. I always love when restaurants are able to make eggs seem creamy and fluffy without adding any cheese to them, and they were certainly successful with this. I definitely want to come back and check out their dinner and also stop next door for the Zadies oyster bar.Pro-Tip: Apparently if you get here early enough, you can get a spot at the counter next to the kitchen and watch the chefs work their magic!",4,1,2,Kelly M.,"New York, NY",100,159,301
1.0,5/11/2017,"I read this was one of the greatest restaurants around and I was very interested in the chef's story about broth and how it cured him of gout and other ailments - broth is the new ""cure-all"" after all (as was tofu and a thousand other things before they found out these things actually caused more harm than good (no offense to ""broth"" - broth may be the real deal)  I still feel a fondness for the chef and his enthusiastic writings - I loved the back of the menu where the chef gave a very clear description of his mission and careful use of ingredients etc. They brought a sample of fennel soup in a glass for us - my husband drank half of it but I could not swallow it - it was so strong and awful ... the bread and butter (they made a big deal about the butter being ""grass fed"") cost $6 and was nothing special but it was the only thing that was not overwhelming in flavor or texture - I ordered the broth but was grossed out by the pieces of marrow floating in it - before going I thought this broth idea might be the cure for my husband's arthritis but he wouldn't eat it - still, the bread and soup were my favorite part ... the food was so strongly flavored - my lettuce salad was inedible due to too much dressing - the meatballs which the people next to us raved about were nothing special - the cauliflower was terrible in that it was over embellished with seasonings but undercooked and unappetizing - the polenta was okay but we didn't come close to finishing it - or anything else for that matter - I stopped at the market after because I was hungry but the memory of the meal made me go to bed without eating.",0,0,0,Eva N.,"Manhattan, NY",2,32,0

It looked cute when we got there but boy was I disappointed with the food.The Ambiance is quite cozy, lots of wood and candlelight ....the usual for restaurants these days. I call it Brooklyn-chiq. The food. The menu was quite unique the waitress came over and explained to us that everything was meant to be family style there's no set appetizer or entree portions it's just all ""food"". The menu is broken up into a few sections what I recall is looking through ""the bread section"" and ""the meat section"". We ordered the garlic bread which was just a sliced piece of baguette with garlic spread on it. My husband ordered the lamb chops and I got the steak. Sounds like it would be a hearty meal right?! Wrong. We were both hungry when we left but didn't really feel like ordering anything else off that menu so I came home and had some noodles.I think this was a combination of the restaurant trying too hard to be unique and in the process depriving patrons with decent flavors coming out of the kitchen. And, us ordering the wrong things or too few dishes. I just didn't feel like having anything from the vegetable or the grains section but I imagine if we had ordered more we would have atleast left full.The menu didn't have any poultry dishes which is odd. The meats were just beef and possibly pork. They had a chicken liver pate which actually looked nice, somebody from the table next to us ordered that. Kinda a bummer since we rarely venture so far for a restaurant and it ended up being a dud. Also agree with the other Yelp reviewers this place is very overpriced for the East Village!

This way we got what we want rather than the kitchen deciding and it was less expensive. Wine list is heavy with French wines and lacking California varietals. My favorite two dishes were the puréed cauliflower plate and the ricotta gnocchi. Most of the table agreed. The gnocchi may have been the best I have ever had. For dessert, we shared two. The ricotta cheesecake and the doughnuts. The cheesecake was very different, basically deconstructed. The ricotta was closer to a pudding than a cheesecake. There were a few pieces of crust and a couple of berries. Not exactly what I was expecting. The donuts were like little cakes with whip cream and a compote and were delicious.

I had the farro with ramps and pecorino (which was amazing), the bone marrow (also amazing) and the steak tartar (absolutely delish). However, the rhubarb tart was so tart as to be unenjoyable, which was a real shame bc the crust was fantastic and the prosecco zabaglione that came with it was TO DIE FOR. Unfortunately the rhubarb was cooked to a mush and needed some more sugar to cut the tart. I also ordered the almond cake, hoping to at least make up for the rhubarb tart. While the cake itself was flawless, it was paired with a confit orange and tart cream that completely offset the cake itself. I don't necessarily lean towards sweet desserts at all but these were both too tart for my liking and the balance was way, way off, which was a really disappointing end to the meal.  That said I very much look forward to going back to sample the rest of the menu.

4.0,2/8/2017,"I had a very great brunch here last weekend. The restaurant itself is rustic and decorated well, and they were accommodating to me changing my reservation time. We started with the cinnamon bun. It was really good and very much an ""adult"" version of the saran-wrap deli cinnamon bun we all grew up having. My only reason to rate it a 4 and not a 5 is that it wasn't warm. I ordered the traditional breakfast - Two eggs, bacon, sausage, and potatoes. I ordered poached eggs and they were cooked perfectly. The bacon was different in a good way. It is paper thing, but they give you quite a bit of it. The flavor was that of bacon, but the texture was quite intriguing. The sausage wasn't traditional sausage, but rather, a sausage patty. It wasn't my favorite thing in the world on its own, but mixed in with the egg, it was really good!Lastly, the MVP, the potatoes. I'm not that much of a fan of breakfast potatoes. They're usually just a filler and are rather cubed french-fries or under-cooked boring potatoes. NOT HERE! The parmesan potatoes were cooked perfectly, and seasoned like crazy. Nothing bland about them. I especially love it when restaurants use parmesan as a seasoning more so than a cheese. They weren't cheesy but wreaked of good cheese in terms of flavor. Overall, this place is at a great price, and does simple food very well. In the era of bastardizing recipes and focusing on ""instagramability"" and not the food, it's refreshing to have a great, down to earth breakfast place in the area.

2.0,2/5/2017,"I'd reached out to a friend to grab some broth and she'd recommended this spot, so I made a brunch reservation for a Sunday afternoon. I was not exactly blown away when I first walked in, and in fact it took me a moment to figure out where to check in for my table -- the bar is the first thing you see when you enter, with the hostess stand further to the left. I was asked to wait a moment before being seated, so I awkwardly stood there for a minute while other guests walked in and were equally as confused about where they were supposed to go.I was finally seated, and took in the atmosphere while waiting for my friend to arrive. Obviously it was crowded, but did the food look good? After a cursory glance at the tables nearby, I felt optimistic. My friend arrived a moment later and we waited about five minutes for someone to acknowledge us; I made a mental note of it although I wasn't exactly bothered by it since I was in the middle of a conversation anyway. When our waitress arrived, we finally ordered -- a kombucha for myself (only later did I realize that it was *10 DOLLARS* for the one bottle), two broths, and the meatballs to share.Everything arrived quickly enough, and being as hungry as I was, I dug right in. The broth itself was tasty, though admittedly I didn't enjoy the greens and everything else that was floating around in it. I probably would've been better off just going to Brodo next door and grabbing it to go. The meatballs were also tasty, but not enlightening in any way, and not anything I'd want to spend $15 for. All in all, with tip including I ended up spending $32 which is really too much for how underwhelmed I was.I'd stopped by the restroom prior to leaving, and was a bit turned off by how dark and messy it was.

1.0,1/24/2017,"Hearth was terrible, don't waste your time or money. I recently had dinner with a large group of friends and had the Rigatoni with Pork Ragu. My husband ordered the Meatballs. What struck us as ridiculous was that he couldn't get pasta with the meatballs. Our plan was to share our dinners and both end up with meatballs and rigatoni.However, the Rigatoni was so undercooked, it was reminiscent of a dog's recently chewed piece of rawhide and sent it back. My husband, whose seat was facing the kitchen, watched the server bring my plate in and hand it to the chef or sous chef, who just shrugged their shoulders. No surprise when the ""new"" rigatoni were equally inedible. I also think it's important to say that no one at our table finished their meal. Yes, the food was that bad.Yes, the atmosphere is cozy, but come on, with so many excellent places to eat in Soho and NYC, don't waste your time or money at Hearth.

2.0,1/15/2017,"A higher end neighborhood staple for many years, I found on this visit a few disappointments. We were seated right next to the kitchen, which for some diners, is an enjoyable experience, but the noise level, coupled with a wall speaker directly across from the table, made conversation extremely difficult . Requests to lower the music were not addressed.We were there with a visitor from Chicago who was not prepared for having to pay extra for 5 pieces of bread . The wine list was very  marked up, but extensive. Most disappointing was the Tusacan fish stew at $29 which was definitely appetizer size-4 mussels, 6 baby clams, a piece of fish, and lots of bread in a lackluster tomato sauce.  The other dishes were adequate, but again portion size minimal.

3.0,12/28/2016,"Came here for the 6-course tasting for $78 as a work team outing. The ambience is on-point given its dim-lighting and overall cozy vibe. It's definitely a restaurant you'd imagine yourself being in when the weather is crazy cold and you just want a nice sit-down dinner with your significant other or close friends, so A for ambience and decor! The only letdown here was that it was an extremely cold day, and the curtains around the front door wasn't as helpful. I was lucky to have sat all the way in the back, but I still experienced a draft by the windows, and felt even more bad for the parties that had tables much closer to the door. We got there at 6:30 when it wasn't busy at all, but didn't start our tasting until 7:15 since we were waiting for our full party to arrive. Luckily, we had a reservation and the resto sat us anyway to order drinks. I ordered The Witch of Blackbird Pond, which boasts both gin and earl grey - two of my favorite ingredients in an early night cocktail. It was good, but nothing much to remember about it. I did enjoy the cocktail list in general, since the names and combination of liquors were interesting!The restaurant quickly filled up from the time we were there at 6:30-8:30PM, which made service really slow. Don't get me wrong, the staff was definitely nice and accommodating, but each of our courses were probably a 20-25 min. wait in between each other. We were getting so hungry in between that we had to ASK for bread! Kind of a bummer that they didn't serve that in the first place. Additionally, one of the courses wasn't explained at all, which was likely just a forgetful mistake by the server, but this was also the first time I've ever experienced that at a tasting. Other than that, the food was great. I especially enjoyed the Cauliflower 3-ways (?) and pork chop, which was very tender and tasty. The dessert course was also really good given that it was an apple cider donut with ice cream on the side. It was the perfect sweetness.Overall, I had a great dinner with my party, but I do need need to knock off some stars for lack of customer service (biggie in my book) and the cocktails not being as great. I probably wouldn't come back here for a tasting, but definitely for a la carte, and maybe in the warmer weather so I can comfortably sit without wearing my jacket.",0,0,0,Jessica A.,"New York, NY",12,22,3

The service was outstanding--knowledgeable, helpful, attentive and attuned to our needs. The bone broth, which is part of what has driven a lot of excitement about Hearth, was simply good. It had none of the gelatinous mouthfeel I expected and was only mildly beefy and very simply seasoned. My family of five shared several dishes. The standout was probably the rigatoni with pork ragu or maybe the meatballs. The gnocchi was pillowy soft but eating more than a couple was too much and they lacked really any flavor. Desserts were just okay. I appreciate the concept and mission of Hearth more than I do the food.",0,0,0,Matt D.,"Loudoun, VA",49,118,9

Unfortunately, her dish was so poorly prepared she sent it back twice. The meatballs were average but a strange dish. In fact, all the dishes were somewhat strange. Another of our group struggled through a suspicous looking rabbit stew. Quite pricey. When the bill came one of our group opened it up and exclaimed, ""Woo, they must've thought we broke a window.""

We didn't have reservations, so I got there right when they open at 6 pm to grab a table in the open environment near the bar. The waitress was so friendly and so helpful in answering all our questions and support our decision making process. And while I was waiting for my friends she brought out a sample of a carrot soup, which was delicious!We ended up getting several dishes to share and when we ordered them the waitresses recommended an order for the plating and ordering of bringing out and enjoying the dishes. She was thoughtful not only about helping us choose menu items, but also conscientious about timing the dishes, so they didn't all come out at once. We ordered:1. Roasted honeynut squash, filled with broth, served with watercress2. Gnocchi with sage3. Autumn fish stew4. Braised grass fed beef5. Side of braised greens with red wine and herbs6. Apple cider doughnuts7. Mint tea and Lemon Verbena teaGreat options for paleo, gluten-free, vegan, and vegetarian. You can even get organ meats here - they have a burger that combines organ meats (this was our runner up option to the braised grass-fed beef).I also really like their philosophy on food. The coasters for our teas shared their version of food rules: 1. buy it with thought2. cook it with care3. serve just enough4. store what will keep5. eat what would spoil6. home-grown is bestDon't waste it!^ I love this and truly felt they encompassed this philosophy when I ate their food.

Then it was the rigatoni. Get that too.Less obvious but arguably more important is the service. The waiters there are some solid human beings. They make me laugh every time I'm around.

3.0,11/9/2016,"Frankly, a bit disappointed.  It's a cute space, and we definitely enjoyed the dishes we tried.  But the price point was way off for me.  Apparently, the menu is envisioned as ""small plates"" with 2-3 recommended per person.  But the prices were closer to full on mains in many cases.  They charged about $30 for 4 oz. of beef (on a fairly minimalist setup).  Meaning, if I wanted a normal 12 or so oz. steak for dinner, I'm looking at $100 after tax.  Without any real sides.  Pretty absurd.  And our service was quite lackluster, as well.  Ended up paying $75 per head for food, came straight home, and promptly made more food out of my own fridge.  If you're going to serve small plates, you need to calibrate the price points correctly or just go ahead and increase the portion sizes.  (And also ended up waiting nearly 15 minutes to use the restroom.  The guy in front of me in line actually just gave up and went back to his table.)  If money is no option/you're on an expense account, go nuts.  But for the rest of us... doubt I'll go back.",0,0,0,Christian L.,"New York, NY",0,7,0

We had a 6pm reservation, and the food came out quickly -- we had five dishes and dessert and were out by 7:15. Note that the menus change monthly, so I'm not sure what we had were seasonal dishes or their regular offerings. Portions are small -- 5 dishes were enough for us, though, and we were stuffed when we left.We ordered the mushrooms with gremolata, the bone marrow, the beef and ricotta meatballs, the long-fermented bread, and the beef broth. The mushooms, meatballs, and bone marrow were absolutely delicious. The bread was ok, but a bit dry and not worth the cheat. The bone broth was good, but could've used more flavor. We had the dark chocolate sampler for dessert. The chocolate was good, but I was a little disappointed that it was basically chunks from a dark chocolate bar.Overall, if the idea of eating locally sourced and seasonal food resonates with you, then you will like this restaurant. i wasn't wowed, but the food was prepared well, and the dishes were smart.

Portion was extremely small (5 pre-sliced small strips - not sure why they pre-sliced a chop..). Also ordered the Japanese sweet potato ($15 before tax & tip). It was nothing to write home about & the plate came with one potato on top of yogurt that they strained themselves.

4.0,9/29/2016,"I had a wonderful dinner at Hearth last night and here's why:Atmosphere: As this restaurant is in NYC, I am usually wary that the vibe will be be ""very New York"" and ""scene"" however, upon entering, I was pleasantly satisfied with the vibe.  Of course, one would expect in East Village that the restaurants be more ""burb-like"" and causual vs. one located in Midtown or Meatpacking.  The place reminded me of a few restaurants I frequent in Fairfield County with a rustic look, very homey and not too crowded.  Every patron seemed to be having an enjoyable experience.  All good signs.Service: The service was fantastic.  Our server was Laura and the exuded her passion for fine cuisine and the hard work that goes in the the plate selections.  She was very knowledgeable about the menu and gave great suggestions.  The speed of service was on point - they made sure water was always filled and checking in, but not too aggressive or hovering. They were respectful about when we were finished with a course or not but still efficient.Food: The food was superb! We started with the late summer beans, sycamore farms corn, and chicken liver paté.  A great mix and variety.  For the main, we shared the smoked bluefish and hake milanese.  When dining out, I like to try as many things on the menu, so if you venture to this lovely little spot, go with people who are down to share and explore with you!Recap: If you make it this far down in the city, I'd recommend stopping in to this little gem.  Nothing like a great farm-to-table restaurant with a friendly, welcoming and knowledgeable staff!  When everything flows from atmosphere to service to food, you're guaranteed a delightful experience.  Will definitely visit again!",0,0,0,Caitlin B.,"Greenwich, CT",378,23,0

First, with a reservation at 1:30pm on Sunday and the restaurant being 1/3 empty, there should be no excuse for nearly an hour wait for our table. The hostess said it was because we changed the number of people from 5 to 6. Really? I could find 5 different ways to arranged the non-occupied tables to sit a party of six. It's not rocket science. After we finally sat down at a table after an hour, our waiter was very nice to present the menu. By presenting, I mean he literally named and described every single brunch item on the menu with great enthusiasm. I loved his energy and help, but honestly, after an hour staring at this one page menu, I could pretty much recite the items. I would've totally appreciated it if he had mentioned something that I wasn't able to read from the menu. Then there was the wait for our food. With 5 orders of Kale & Eggs ( the dish includes exactly what it sounds like), the time it took seemed like eternity, or enough time for someone to run to the farm and pick up some fresh kale.

The second problem is the menu, which I suppose is meant to be idiosyncratic, but is indecipherable without a server's assistance. I found it very profoundly irritating.Porridge, pasta, bread, polenta and gnocchi are all grouped under ""grains."" One can only infer by the prices that some are appetizers and others are entrees. Does anyone go into a restaurant and say to themselves, ""I wonder what kind of grains they're serving today?""  Why would you organized a menu this way? But at least the grains were somewhat intelligible.  Skipping over the $66 spatchcock chicken ""for two"" (whatever that is) and the offal section which includes a ""variety burger"" made of 4 types of animal protein including heart and liver, and served with a side of fried market potatoes (what does ""market"" mean in this context?), we land on the charred spring vegetables, and are astounded by the lack of information about this dish. We all ended up pulling out our phones and looking at photos on Hearth's Yelp page, but that didn't help either, since they apparently change the menu every month, making 95% of the photos irrelevant.I ended up with the mushroom trifolati gremolata (whatever that means) and gemelli with spring peas, pesto and lemon. Since the gemelli was listed under grains, I guessed correctly that it was some sort of pasta. The mushrooms were very good, the pasta was decent. Our party of 7 decided to leave w/o dessert because the noise had become unbearable. With 2 bottles of wine, bill came to $472 w/o tip.",1,0,0,Tom G.,"Demarest, NJ",0,8,0
3.0,6/21/2016,"Our waiter was very effusive in introducing us to the restaurant and described Hearth as a ""cult classic."" I understand the feel, I get the concept, but between the execution (excellent here, okay there) and price (fairly high across the board), I give hearth 4 stars (7/10 in my book).HIGHLIGHTS:-their vegetable dishes are great!-their in house bread is fantastic as well-the beef meatballs are forgettable-lamb was executed very well Charred Spring Vegetables: ""sunflower seed hummus, lemon ... 15""Pea shoots, fresh peas, beans, and some asparagus. Flavors were great, hummus was ethereally smooth and cream. Shoots were a little stringy, the char on the asparagus and beans really amped up the flavor. (8.5/10)Fava Bean Salad: ""pecorino toscano, spring onion, grilled bread... 16""The dish was about 55% grilled bread, 45% actual salad. The beans were very fresh and tender, the spring onion and red wine vinegar was very bright and zingy. The parsley flavor here is quite strong. Bread was their in house, long-fermented bread I think. Nice heft, chew, and crust. The cheese comes in little dice actually. The balance was on point and great textural contrast overall. (8/10)Garlic Bread: ...6In house bread, generously buttered and garlicked. No complaints here, same good things to say about their bread as I said earlier. Probably the best deal on the menu. (8/10)Gemelli: ""spring peas, pesto, lemon...23""This is one of the largest portions on the menu (therefore it's about moderately sized). The pesto and lemon are really the dominant flavors here, the plate has a nice mix of mellow pastel green and bring green. However, I really was unimpressed by the gemelli itself. It wasn't tender, it was just dense. It didn't feel like the nice bouncy chew of fresh pasta. I understand what al dente was, and technically this may have been al dente but it just felt very dense to me. (6/10)Beef and Ricotta Meatballs: ""house tomato sauce...22""This is apparently a Hearth classic and has never been removed from the menu. I was expecting something incredible but was mostly disappointed. The texture was fairly light and fluffy but it did hold together. That said, the flavor wasn't very beefy, yet I couldn't taste any milkiness from the ricotta either. I think the ricotta mostly contributed to the whipped texture and the beef's initial flavor wasn't strong enough to withstand dilution by the ricotta. I didn't think the sauce was anything special either, not much freshness to it, feels more like a long and slow boiled tomato sauce (which doesn't go well with not so flavorful meatballs). Also, there are 3 large balls to a serving, but would I have paid 7.50 for a single one of those meatballs? Heck no. (6/10)Roasted Spring Lamb: ""fregola, peas, oregano... 30""Tbh, I didn't notice the oregano taste at all. I don't like lamb generally but this lamb loin was superbly cooked. It may have been a little bit more done than most people would like, ours was mostly medium-well around the edges and medium rare only in the center. But I thought the texture was great, great seared flavor and the flavor really permeated the fregola and peas as well. (8/10)",0,0,1,Nick H.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",358,320,790

4.0,6/18/2016,"Great (and surprisingly huge) spot in the East Village that's perfect for a slightly unconventional date or dinner with friends. While not super out of the ordinary, the menu consists mainly of small, fairly minimalist plates. Think: meat without any starchy sides, e.g. burger & toppings without a bun. The food itself is very good though, and the modest portions are actually pretty perfect if you like trying different things and not feeling disgusting later. A bit on the pricey side, but genuinely good and fresh-tasting food. Apparently it's responsibly farmed, so that's a bonus. I'd recommend the Variety Burger (made with heart, liver, and chuck) and the ricotta meatballs. Both full of flavor and meaty & delicious without being overwhelming.

Not the usual this wine goes with this plate - but this wine makes this dish five times better. I'd rate the food with 4 stars, the wine 5, and the service (5+) was what truly made our experience.

5.0,6/3/2016,"I have been to Hearth twice now (for dinner) and had a great experience both times. The restaurant completely reflects the name: it is extremely warm and inviting. Last night I was lucky enough to try several different things on the menu: garlic bread, fava bean salad, charred spring vegetables, meatballs, chicken liver pate, gnocchi, gemelli-- and I had the beef tartare the first time I went a few weeks ago.Both the fava bean salad and charred spring vegetables are great options from the ""Vegetable"" section. I would happily order both again. If you like beef tartare, order it here-- It's excellent. Onto the pastas- I ordered the gemelli both times I have eaten at Hearth. The pasta is fresh, soft,delicious and the peas are bright and refreshing. Last night I also tried the gnocchi for the first time- It was great: soft, doughy in a sage butter sauce.What I love about this restaurant is how fresh and seasonal the ingredients are. You feel like you are eating clean even if you are eating a hunk of bread. Come to mention, the bread at Hearth is great too. The servers I have had here were both friendly, informative and knowledgeable about the menu. I had read another review stating that the service is great when you have their attention, but you don't necessarily always have their attention. I somewhat agree with that-- And that is really the only flaw of my experience. We sat waiting for the check for a little while last night before our waiter came back around-- drinks and dessert were both finished, but that is really the only (bad) thing I can think of.OH, the dessert-- The chocolate pudding is great-- cocoa nibs, sea salt, whipped cream. We also got the apple cider donuts last night as well. As soon as the plate hits the table, you can smell the apple cider and the donuts were just delicious.

The interior is lovely, with dimly lit lights and an eclectic mix of thoughtful pieces that make it a great for a date night or a friendly get-together. The food was great - we had the meatballs, gnocchi (which got rave reviews all around), the ""variety"" burger, some mushrooms, garlic bread, and the pork chop (which my dad described as the best he's ever had). The dishes are great but small. They actually recommend 3 dishes per person, and with protein dishes costing close to $30, that can get steep. But that's not why I knocked off a star. The service, while very friendly and courteous, is only so when you do have their attention, and I can't stress that enough. Upon being seated it took a good 10-15 min for anyone to offer us water, and it took another 15-20 for anyone to take our order. We literally had to stop someone in their tracks to get their attention, and while incredibly friendly, all they said was they'll get our server for us, which didn't happen for another 10 min or so.

5.0,5/16/2016,"Hearth was not my first choice for dinner this evening. I foolishly forgot to make reservations then needed to scramble to find a place. For some reason, they had a late night option available. My tardiness turned out to be fortuitous.I split two vegetable dishes with a guest and both were excellent. The Fava Bean Salad was laced with Pecorino and served over crunchy toast. The Roasted Vegetables were pea pods, peas and a beautiful seed humus tinted with lemon. People have died for baked polenta this good. Buttery, cheesy, rich, with the only side note the excessive Rosemary on the top. I'd suggest taking the spice off, dice it and toss a bit back in.Hominy-crusted pork chop! Who thinks of such creative combos? The chop was served with sausage and carrots an melted in my mouth. My guest also enjoyed the cod.For dessert, we elected to try the ""Chocolate Tasting"" which consisted of a flight of dessert wines (wide interpretation here, please) and chocolates with a variety of cocoa percentages. This was a fun, fun option that promoted lots of conversation revolving around opinions and reasons.I could not be more pleased and fascinated by dinner at Hearth. Even though we were the last people to leave on that late night, the staff was still helpful and energized.

My only wish was that my Moscow Mule would've come in a cool cup but i'm not really complaining.Our server was very knowledgeable, nice, chatty, and attentive. He helped us decide what to get and how much. There was a weird wait in between courses, which he apologized for and made up. Everything was perfectly portioned and was unlike anything I've ever tasted -- truly delicious! Our starter veggie dishes were all shared and we couldn't get enough. I ordered the gnocci, which was great, but the hake looked a lot better. The burger at the table was also good.

I started with the fava bean salad which was loaded onto an olive oil soaked piece of toast. Flavorful, bright, delicious. For the main course, I got the lamb bolognese with perfectly al dente whole grain pasta and big chunks of lamb.

1.0,4/13/2016,"This place has gone really downhill. I've been coming here for years as a delicious though expensive place to dine in the East Village, where high-quality fine-dining is hard to come by. I've always loved Marco Canora and Hearth. So I was very surprised to find that it's changed a lot. First, the menu has gone trendy and deconstructed, which is annoying. Why can't menus just tell you what's an appetizer and what's an entree? How am I supposed to construct my meal amid this nonsense? That was a cute gimmick for about three seconds in the Gowanus area three years ago, but the time has passed. Second, there's lots of total bullshit sloganing on the walls about how morally correct the food is. ""Food. Buy it with thought. Cook it with care. Don't waste it."" Uhm, this is place where its easy to drop $300 on dinner. You are being a first-rate first-world consumer by dining here. You are not going for simplicity or non-waste or whatever the b.s. is. This restaurant should either respect itself as a fine-dining establishment or change its business, not pretend that it's somehow thrifty or simple to dine here. And then third, the food was awful. My pork was an extremely fatty cut, so underdone that it was hard to chew. (The restaurant is so dark you can't see the color of the meat, but the texture was all wrong. It was raw.) Also, I understand that fat is hip but not glistening un-rendered fat. I couldn't eat the pork so I ordered some clams, and they were weird and a little slimy too. And then the donut dessert was sweet and flavorless. All style, no substance. I will never go back. Oh, yeah, and ha ha guess what the topping on the pork was? Raw kale. That's cooking for you.

5.0,2/2/2016,"Great place for brunch. I'd been for dinner before which was good but had been wanting to try brunch since there seemed to be so many great reviews about it. The restaurant is a good sized restaurant for new york and you don't feel like you're being cramped into a tiny space. I really enjoyed the food. I started off with Brunch Punch which was a nice alternative to the usual mimosa for brunch. It had flavors of bourbon and blood orange which are both great flavors in my opinion. My only complaint about the Brunch Punch was the tiny little teacup that it comes in. I would have liked more but maybe that's just my boozy self speaking. If you like blood marys, then you'll be happy to know they have a couple versions that you can choose from. Our table started off with sharing the apple cider dougnut holes. Totally worth the $5. Get them. Tasted like they were freshly made, and were the perfect little snack while we waited for our meal. Our table had the Chestnut pancakes, beef and ricotta meatballs, tomato and eggs, and the tuscan kale and pork sausage. My absolute favorite were the beef and ricotta meatballs. They were flavorful and quite satisfying and sitting in a delicious savory red sauce. The Chestnut pancakes were huge. I kind of feel the portion size is meant for 2. The pancakes were good if you're looking for a sweet breakfast option. The guy who ordered the tomato and eggs was a bit disappointed when he saw the item, he thought it was a bit simple but as the meal went on he found it tastier and tastier. I had a bite and it was very flavorful version of a shashuka but it could have used something to dip up all that tasty sauce. It only came w a small toasted slice of bread but that's it. Overall a great meal and experience. Would definitely recommend going for brunch.",3,0,0,Michele P.,"San Jose, CA",67,138,1156

Recently went back cuz I heard they are offal strong :) But at the end I opted for something light and closer to my heart - #fish. This grilled romanesco salad with smoked bluefish and sunflower seeds are light, flavorful and perfect for sharing. For strong flavor, salty as bluefish, you need a light red wine that offers medium acidity such as Pinot . For that you can always count on Hearth's extensive wine list.I also got the chicories salad with bangs cauda - some sort of anchovies dip and Parmesan . Also good tho it was less memorable.

3.0,12/15/2015,"IN SHORT: Warm, exceptionally hearty dishes with rustic Italian influences fill this East Village restaurant. While there is nothing new to eat at Hearth, there is plenty to enjoy.THE STORY: In reviewing restaurants, a thin, nebulous line inevitably forms dividing good restaurants from great restaurants. While certain parameters like technical dexterity and execution are more clear, other criterion like creativity and originality are inherently vague and imprecise, and seem to often change with the direction of the wind on any given day.I thought about this line a lot while dining at Hearth recently. I asked what made Hearth good, but not great, and more specifically, I asked if there was merit in a restaurant that lacked originality but succeeded executing a technically flawless dish. Because unfortunately at Hearth, I had the distinct feeling that I had already tried everything on the menu somewhere else, and ultimately somewhere better.I'm going to wax philosophical for a minute. In architecture school, I took an entire semester-long studio on ""Uncreative Architecture."" Its thesis was that there is no such thing as originality in architecture, and that today's students of the discipline should steal ideas from anywhere and anyone, as long as those ideas fuel inspiration and resonate with one's imagination. The caveat, however, was that this thievery must not be concealed, but rather must be actively confronted and engaged in the uncreative production in order to create great architecture.Using this framework, I'll now get back to Hearth. The chef Marco Canora opened Hearth after cooking at Gramercy Tavern and Craft under the influential guidance of Tom Colicchio. He billed Hearth as Tuscan-American fine dining with an emphasis on farm-to-table fare. Hm, sounds eerily similar to the concepts pioneered by those original 3-star restaurants.While the imitative concept could be forgiven, this familiarity continues right into the dishes themselves. Hearth's Gnocchi, sitting in a pool of luxuriously rich melted butter and sprinkled with salt, pepper and a bit of dried herbs is clearly the counterfeit version of the gnocchi at Craft, which stands up texturally much better than Hearth's occasionally soft and grainy bites.The Roasted Cauliflower with sunflower seeds and greens was more compelling, if a little bland, but was made more unsettling by its weak imitation of the same vegetable found at the stronger restaurants on Chef Canora's past resume.Main courses like the Beef & Ricotta Meatballs over a heaping mound of cacio e pepe polenta are the most enjoyable, though at $31, surprisingly expensive for a rustic, red-sauce kind of dish. The meatballs, however, were perfectly juicy and tender, and the polenta as creamy and salty as everyone raves. Chef Canora also handles his pastas well, and the Rigatoni with pork ragu, rosemary, and ricotta hits all the pleasure sensors on a chilly winter evening.Despite many well executed and enjoyable plates, the service often struggles. At my first dinner at Hearth, I was seated for 30 minutes without seeing my waiter, a shocking amount of time during which I would have loved to at least order a glass of wine. The trend continued throughout the meal, with the staff appearing rushed, inattentive, and clumsy. For an amuse-bouche at one meal, I was given a warm chickpea soup in a shot glass, a deeply unsettling way to drink soup. I wondered if this was just the restaurant's misguided attempt at creativity, but when I looked at a neighboring table, I noticed with disappointment that the same soup was served there in a much larger vessel.There is skill, fidelity, and pleasure in Hearth's cooking, to be sure. But true creativity takes courage, and Hearth's inability to creatively borrow or honestly address or transform its familiar cuisine is what ultimately defines it as a good restaurant, but not a great one.",2,1,0,Ali M.,"New York, NY",31,234,245

I've come here with the same friend three times over the past two years. The first time the A/C was broken in the dead of summer, and the second time resulted in a bout of food poisoning. Yet, we decided to make a third and final trip to see if this place could finally convince us why this place is such a big deal among our friends and the Yelp community.Unfortunately, the third time wasn't the charm. Mind you, it was our best experience here among the three, but in my mind, there were just too many cons versus pros to warrant anything more than 3.5 stars (rounded down because of our prior visits).. So let's get to it. Pros-Prime location in the East Village. Perfect if you want hit up a bar for post-dinner drinks.-Cool space. Chic, but not pretentious. -Friendly, down to earth servers. Very knowledgeable about the menu.-If you have to order two dishes make it (1) the warm autumn vegetables and (2) the gnocchi. The vegetables are autumn in a bowl. The pumpkin and squash pair perfectly with the maple vinaigrette. Comfort food at its finest. And the gnocchi are absolute pillows of heaven. Probably the best I've ever had. Cons-Arrived on time for 8pm reservation. Still waited 15 minutes for our table to be prepped.-Food took about 45 minutes to get to our table from the time we ordered.-While the fluke dish was tasty, the fish itself was just way too overcooked and dried out.-Everyone seems to swoon over the veal and ricotta meatballs. Not sure why. Fairly muted flavors. It was okay, not great. And the ""cacio e pepe"" polenta the meatballs were served on was nothing to write home about. Honestly, I feel like I could make a comparable dish at home.-The food is just too expensive for what it is. This is really my biggest gripe with this place. I'm more than willing to shell out $60+ for a meal if the food is worth it, but the quality and the flavors of the food have to be there, for the entire meal, and not for just a couple of dishes.",5,3,3,Joel P.,"Astoria, Queens, NY",195,78,141

All of the aesthetic elements give you the feeling of warmth and comfort, paying homage to the restaurant's namesake. I went in for brunch, and while the menu sounded great, I opted to go for my own build-a-brunch and ordered a couple starters as my main. First, I had their Smoked Salmon Deviled Eggs. Now, I'm not a huge deviled egg person, but I love smoked salmon, so, that trumped the former. I really loved these, and if you enjoy smoked salmon, you're not going to want to eat a regular deviled egg again. They have a really nice balance of the smoked salmon flavor mixed in the creamy and smooth yolk filling. Then, they're topped with a little piece of crispy fried fish skin, adding a touch of crunch and texture.Then, I had the Balsamic Marinated Eggplant Toast with Ricotta and Basil. These little toast bites were amazing. They might look small, but they're pretty mighty, topped with delicious and hearty ingredients, they make for an excellent part of your meal, or, as an appetizer to share. The eggplant has a fantastic sweet and slightly smokey flavor, completely tender, and a touch of tang from the balsamic.

Hard to find good lardo outside of Italy, and hearth's perfectly whipped rendition is some of the best I've tasted. The chicken liver pate was also to die for good. My only complaint as regards the charcuterie is that there wasn't more of that amazing pork rillette on the plate. Perhaps not the best rillette I've ever tasted, but the rosemary is a thoughtful touch.But the best part of Hearth is the gnocchi, which is just casually listed as a side dish for $8 and is the best $8 you will ever spend.

3.0,5/24/2015,"I am ambivalent. Pro: We arrived early (just before the 6:00 PM opening). Ordered drinks at the bar. The bartender was beyond helpful and charming. Made useful suggestions and gave my wife 3 sample glasses an aperitif to taste.An auspicious beginning. The best mixed green salad I have ever had anywhere. Spectacular. I know it is hard to wax euphoric over a salad, but it was that good. My entree was the halibut. Done perfectly, however, portion size was minute and I mean tiny. Three of our party of six had the same dish. All of us felt the same way. For $31 they could at least plate a 2 ounce portion. The BIG negative: noise. My iPhone has two sound meter apps. By 8:00PM when the restaurant was almost full the noise level measured over 85 dB continuously. This seems to be the new normal for NYC restaurants but I hate it.Hearth is only a 10 minute walk from my home. But it will be quite a while before I return. Three reasons:1) Small menu (check it out on line before you go).2) Pricey. This would not be an over-riding concern for special  occasions, except...3) I want to be able to talk to my guests. The ambient noise level makes this a chore. Even though the tables are small i would not recommend this venue for a party of six.

(highly recommend) They felt like fluffy savory clouds~ NOW the reason for the 3 stars was solely based on the main course. I ordered the Pizzoccheri with Mushrooms, cabbage, and Fontina. It was incredibly underwhelming and possibly the worst dish I've had in some time. The flavors were ok, but mixed all together, there was something really wrong. It was so graniy, it took me a few minutes to chew through the pasta, and eventually felt+tasted like microwaved dirt.

4.0,4/1/2015,"My amazing girlfriend brought me here with the added surprise of sitting at the chef's pass counter for my big 3-0 bday.  It was completely worth the show.  We started with the quail and the octopus.  The quail was expertly seasoned and the two small pieces were placed nicely on the farro, which is a favorite grain of mine.  The octopus I think was the best I have ever had.  I have had a lot of lousy versions, and a ton of perfectly tenderized octopi, but this the way they grilled and and marinated it took the prize.  Then came the beef neck and my striped bass.  The beef neck was the best beef I have ever had in a restaurant.  It just pulled apart and was tender.  The striper was indeed good and perfectly prepared, but I had dreams about the beef neck.  The apple cider doughnuts were fried to perfection with sweetened apple bits to accompany them.  I am not a dessert person, but I would go back for them alone.  The wine list is prized to be diverse and boy it was.  There was nothing generic or standard about it.  I love wine and know a lot about wine, and I did not know 70% of this list.  The server also needed a little more education on them.  Our server was very nice and professional.  He was very cheery and was eager to help us.",8,5,7,Peter K.,"Manhattan, NY",244,557,33

3.0,2/14/2015,I came here for brunch last Sunday with a girlfriend. I was really looking forward to it because of the great yelp reviews. I knew my no brainier choice would be the meatballs with polenta. I absolutely love polenta and I like to try meatballs everywhere I go. So far these don't even crack the top 40. The meatballs were not juicy and delicious like meatballs are supposed to be. They were kind of dry and flavorless to be honest. The polenta wasn't bad at all but there should have been more of it. They majorly skimped on the ratio of polenta to meatball. I was super disappointed. I ate it anyway and took my extra meatball and a half home. I tried my friends pancakes and those were pretty delicious. Maybe I ordered the wrong thing or maybe it was an off day. I don't know but the I was sad. I would come back to try their dinner.

But this dish was just the right balance of nourishing and tasty. Besides...that just leaves room for more drinks.The brunch cocktails are good and all around $10.

It got a bit loud towards the close of the evening since everyone in the restaurant was getting quite drunk off the super wine menu, but that's fine. Also, surprisingly enough, they had a very nice beer menu as well (though being a bit of a beer geek I know that a lot of that stuff was waaaaay overpriced).We got the tasting menu for $86 a person - I liked everything they gave us, and it was a great first time experience. With that said, I would not get it again simply because it isn't my type of meal. The chef is quite inventive with the different foods which are in market right now (we had a very autumn-y type of meal), and also it turned out they had a huge collection of apple ciders from all over NYC.Two things to note:1) They do meat VERY well.

For mains we had scallops and meatballs, with a side of gnocchi, and while both mains were lovely, the gnocchi really stole the show.

The ok: peanut butter chocolate ice cream sundae. A good sundae, but nothing super distinctive about it. Not quite enough peanut butter goodness for my taste.The bad: Olive oil poached salmon (especially at $38!!).  Fish was well cooked, but not very flavorful. Olive oil flavor did not really come thorough. Also, the portions were staggeringly small given the price, and I did not particularly enjoy composition of the plate (very heavy on bitter vegetables), and found the quinoa unremarkable.The service was good, as was the wine we ordered.

As a first course, the warm vegetable salad, had a superb combination of perfectly grilled vegetables with a hint of pickling that I really enjoyed, a great starter, that thankfully Marco, Chef/owner recommended. I then tried the rigatoni with lamb ragu, that the barmaid had recommended, she proudly said, ""if you try anything, try that.""  I don't think I have ever had rosemary in pasta before, but, surprisingly, it worked well with the lamb ragu. I was two for two. For a main, the lamb tenderloin, cooked perfectly with caramelized root carrots, was a home run, and everything encompassed by top notch service, in elegant dining venue, that somehow, regardless of its appearance, was comfortably casual.

The ricotta sformata was great with chanterelles and the ricotta was perfect. The fish course was bass with caramelized onions, the house pasta was good with excellent zucchini.  The lamb include a bit of pork belly and a side of gnocchi was added.  The only wine mismatch was a sherry to go with the lamb.  A bold idea but we would have preferred a red.  The first sweet was dish was the panne cotta and the dessert was a fruit crumb with ice cream, the only less than ideal dish.  The dessert wines were a Braida Brachetto and a Boch Eiswein that were perfect.  We could have done without the last course but were very pleased overall with the experience.   A wide range of innovative dishes and wines at reasonable price for New York.",0,0,0,Ed D.,"Columbia, SC",6,49,1

2.0,6/22/2014,"I'm pretty shocked Hearth is so highly rated. The pros: the hostess was nice, our reservation for 4 was seated right away despite being pretty crowded and we stayed for hours until closing with very little interference. The cons: pretty much everything else. Our friend is a sommelier and had perused the EXTENSIVE (too long) wine list before we arrived and asked for 4 separate bottles before we landed on one they actually had. However after waiting 25 min or more for the wine the waitress arrived with a totally different wine of her choosing since our fourth choice had ended up being out as well. We ordered a $95 bottle of wine and at that price point she really should have come back to confirm our 5th choice and honestly probably comped part of the cost. The food was forgettable at best and really pretty gross overall, especially the poached salmon. The polenta sounded amazing but was really just creamy black pepper, too much pepper and when that wore off, just bland mush. I usually don't comment much on the staff but our server was also really odd. She had a fake accent (confirmed when we asked where she was from), mumbled, and we couldn't understand anything she said to the point where it was laughable.

The brunch punch was not good. That may be personal opinion. It had Campari in it which my friend tells me is supposed to taste bitter. I took two sips and didn't finish it.

The food is of course artisan, but the service was off on my visit.  Came here on Sunday at 12:45 for brunch with a girlfriend.  Make reservations, and while you're at that - come for the full experience at dinner, which I hope is better.I had a simple freshly squeezed OJ, and my girlfriend had a soy latte to start. The weirdest thing is that our waitress didn't know if they had soy milk.. non dairy is a huge thing for a lot of folks so it'd just really strange if a restaurant of Hearth's caliber didn't have soy milk. Turns out, they did and all was well.It took quite a while for us to get our order taken.  I had the (perfectly) poached eggs with kale and pork sausage. It was nice and light- great sauteed kale, and not too salty or strong ground pork.  The grilled toast alongside it was buttery and nice-- if there was no butter on it, I figured it'd be a a bit dry.  My friend had the curried chicken sandwich, recommended by the waitress, along with grilled toast with mushrooms, goat cheese, and toast with local jams. The jams were nice but the raspberry and blackberry were indistinct from each other; the apricot was pretty good, with chunks of real fruit (I think it was apricot- they didn't say on the menu).  The toast it came with was rather dry.   There was some curt miscommunication between the ordering but hey it happens. My friend didn't like her sandwich, and the waitress kindly took it off the bill. The best thing she ordered was the toast with mushrooms and goat cheese- lots of mushroom flavor and nice goat cheese.  These apps of my friend's did come our at the same time as her sandwich; we had to remind them she ordered them.The weirdest thing was that they made a huge mistake on our bill nonetheless- somehow we were charged with a side of bacon, another poached egg dish and a frittata.  Wow. Not close at all- our total bill was shaved by $30-40 when I brought this up, and then our waitress mysteriously presented us with a credit card for payment that wasn't ours. Er.. OK to good food, and lovely, homey (but spacious) interior- occasional celeb sighting (we are Bobby Flay today walk in), they give away free Edible mags :) but yeah.. not worth the return.

4.0,2/26/2014,"Hearth has been a staple in New York City's dining scene for over a decade, but it was only in the past year that they rolled out their weekend brunch service. In all honesty, I was surprised that it had taken them so long to implement, but after a quick skim of the menu, I immediately made a reservation for two for brunch. Nestled on a busy street in East Village, Hearth has a fairly nondescript exterior and it took me a few tries until I found the entrance. Nonetheless, I was greeted by a perfect brunch setting on this Saturday afternoon; an open dining area, plenty of floor to ceiling windows that let in an abundance of sunlight, and a simplistic array of furniture that blended in with the wood-themed interior.Once we were seated at our table, we were pleasantly surprised with a greeting from Chef Marco Canora. He had stepped out of the kitchen to personally hand us a small amuse bouche for the day, a tiny glass filled with a sweet, frothy orange-based drink. It was a nice touch to see him in the dining room throughout the day, greeting diners and asking them about their meal. We did, however, have to decide on our plates and turned our attention to the menu. Hearth's brunch menu isn't too off the cuff, but there are some interesting interpretations and modifications to traditional items that make these dishes unique. Their Florentina, for example, is paired with pig trotters and it was the first time that I had seen kale in the same dish as baked eggs. The latter caught my eye, though, and with a nod of approval from our waitress, I decided on my meal.The Baked Eggs are, at first glance, a fairly simple plate: two lightly baked eggs are plated a top a melange of tuscan kale and shredded pork sausage. Two slices of toasted sourdough slices drizzled in olive oil are served on the side to finish off the dish. The kale and shredded pork was surprisingly delicious; the kale had been generously braised and seasoned and the pork added a savory meatiness to the combination. It was with no small amount of delight that I cut into the eggs, and the resulting combination of the runny yolk, kale, and pork was heavenly. The portion was just right - filling, but not too substantial.We decided to finish our meal on a sweeter note and ordered the Apple Cider Donut Holes. A small plate of them arrived quickly afterwards, consisting of 7 lightly glazed donut holes that were topped off with a sprinkle of confectioner's sugar. They were surprisingly dense, sweet, and with a significant apple flavor in each bite.In sum, it was a satisfying, peaceful brunch that we had here. Professional staff, well-prepared and unfussy food, and a delightful dining ambiance ensured a solid experience. At the very least, I can vouch for Hearth during its earlier hours and I'd definitely look forward to their dinner service, where the offerings seem even more delicious.",8,4,9,Lori L.,"New York, NY",2244,608,6827

2.0,2/13/2014,"So disappointed!  After living in the East Village and never having tried this so-called ""institution"", I decided to finally take my wife here for dinner last night.  Before I give my opinion about what was wrong with this place, I will say that the staff was very friendly and very accommodating.  That said, my real problems with this place were the food, the value, and the ambiance.   While all of the food was of good quality and fresh, the dishes just failed to impress.  For appetizers we had the octopus (nice and tender but did not pair well with garlic and citrus), the pear and pecorino salad (bland dressing), and the ricotta sformato (this was actually quite interesting and delicious).  As for entrees, we had the chicken which was weakened by the sauce it was in, and the striped bass which was fine but nothing to write home about.  Adding fuel to the fire of this lackluster meal were the 4 different glasses of white wine we tried, each worse than the next.  All of these issues combined with a very disappointing ambiance made this completely not worth the money.  With all of the great restaurants here in NYC, I just could not justify going back to this place.",0,0,0,Eric B.,"Brooklyn, NY",1,9,0

4.0,2/5/2014,"I had an excellent dinner here recently with a lady friend for my 30th birthday. I've always walked by this place and wanted to try it. First off, their wine list is extensive...intimidatingly so. The sommelier is quite helpful however with your tastes; they didn't have the montepulciano I wanted but within minutes showed up with something quite similar in taste and I thoroughly enjoyed both the wine and the fact that I discovered something new! The service is impeccable. From being seated to leaving, everyone on staff was friendly, helpful, polite and a pleasure to deal with. We were always checked upon and had our glasses refilled without even knowing it at times.The bread they serve is incredible....definitely filled up on it and dont regret it!For appetizers we had:Ricotta Formatto: delicious, mushrooms had the perfect texture and the parmesan was a delicious complementChicken Dumpling soup: Not very impressive but still good for a winters night. Soaking up the bread in the soup was the best part!Citrus Octopus: A STANDOUT! The texture of the octopus was incredible, usually some part of the octopus has that rubbery seafood feel but this was 100% smooth and soft. The blood orange was a great complement as well. Must order this!For mains:Cacciuco: Big portions of seafood, all properly prepared and delicious. I really liked the clams and the calamari and the giant prawn was really filling as well. Not overwhelmingly great but would order again if I went.Veal Meatballs: These are HUGE! And tasty! I ended up taking half of them home as I was getting incredibly full at this point but if you're a meatball fan definitely get this. Put a piece on some of the appetizer bread as well if you're in the mood for a treat :)Dessert:Chocolate Creme Brulee: Underwhelming. Maybe its because the chocolate was more of a ""dark chocolate"" variety which I'm not a fan of but I wouldn't order this again. It was decent but after such a great meal this failed to live up to expectations.Apple Cider Doughnuts: MMMM yeah order this. A standout for sure! Soft warm donuts with whipped cream as a complement really hit the spot! At this point my belt was stretching but I really didn't care. Atmosphere in general was cozy but with a good amount of conversational ambience even for a Monday night. I'm sure this is much busier during prime time nights. The one caveat I had was with the pricing...the food here is a bit pricey especially with so much similar competition in the neighborhood (Westville, etc). The price would be the only deterrent to stopping by again as I had a great meal but the pricing I thought wasn't in line with the experience. But if you want to stop by and eat here you could do FAR WORSE. I'm happy I stopped by :)",2,0,0,Saad M.,"Manhattan, NY",58,235,0
3.0,2/4/2014,"I recently had the fortune of enjoying a delicious brunch with two of my favorite people at Hearth, a restaurant I read about in Timothy Ferriss's book, the 4-Hour Chef. In the book, Timothy emphatically describes the culinary prowess of Marco Canora, the chef-owner of Hearth and Terroir. After seeing many positive reviews about their brunch, I booked a table shortly after the new year.There was still snow on the ground when Anna and I stepped out of the cab. We were running 10 minutes late and Miho had already texted that she was close by. We gingerly stepped over newly formed slush puddles, a result of New York's bipolar weather.  The entrance to Hearth isn't where you think it is. The correct entrance can be found around the corner on 12th street. The first thing I noticed was a beautiful bookshelf filled with cookbooks, memoirs, and Marco's book, Salt to Taste. Miho arrived late after getting confused with the wrong door. Pretty standard. After the three of us settled down and placed our orders, I looked around and saw many menus from famous restaurants around the world hanging on the wall. Naturally, the menu next to me was from Sukiyabashi Jiro. Below is an accompanying letter.After my fanboy moment passed, we were treated to a delicious chai latte drink that filled the area with a spiced aroma and warmed our bodies.The first course was apple cider donut holes which were recommended by yelpers. The dish didn't disappoint - the aroma of caramelized apples made me swallow hard as I brought the first donut to my mouth. Warm flecks of apple greeted me as the donut flaked apart. The dusting of sugar was a nice touch that made us hungry for more.The veal and ricotta meatballs were satisfyingly juicy and the cheesy polenta was creamy. Simple, rustic, what more could you ask for.I was glad when Miho selected a healthy vegetable frittata since my resolution was to refrain from meat twice a week for the month of January. Miho wrote an inspiring article that was published on HuffPo which focused on monthly resolutions and keeping your friends accountable. We continued talking about resolutions and goals for 2014 but were distracted a few times by the fluffy buckwheat ricotta pancakes with banana, walnuts, and maple syrup. The service and brunch was great and definitely warrants a trip back to check out their dinner menu.(For the full entry, visit scrumphsus.com/blog/2014…)",2,1,1,Scrumphsus B.,"New York, NY",1,21,71

5.0,1/19/2014,"The best chicken I've ever had ANYWHERE. The smoked chicken breast with braised thigh, chestnuts, beans, cabbage and butternut squash was superb; the chicken was moist and so flavorful, the veges divine. Another in our party had the rigatoni with pork ragu. It was hearty, very rich and terrific, as was the excellent venison loin two others had.    I started with the Ribollita which is a bread soup with black cabbage, white beans and parmigiana. Normally I wouldn't have ordered it, but our server sang its praises, so I decided to try it and I'm so glad I did. It was dense, very tasty and memorable. I loved it. Octopus carpaccio was good, but not great; the blood orange, hearts of Palm and pistachios were flavorful, but the raw octopus was rather tasteless.  Pear and pecorino salad was huge!  Everything is farm to table and very fresh. All servings are large, so get ready to take home multiple doggie bags, but no matter how cute your pup is, keep the food for yourself!       Desserts were amazing. The mint chocolate cookie sundae was orgasmic! Crumbled dark chocolate mint cookie with hot fudge and ice cream...who needs anything else? Apple cider doughnuts are always good and the cranberry cake was a standout.  If you prefer, there is a strong selection of artisanal cheeses.      The wait staff is enthusiastic, knowledgeable, and extremely helpful but never pushy.

I had their Griffith Thomas, which is a whiskey, sherry, and cointreau blend. It was smooth, and a pleasure to drink. I also had a taste of their warm cider rum cocktail, which is rather tasty - only be careful not to burn your tongue because it can be too hot at first.The bar area is a pleasant place to sit at, with the chairs evenly spaced and no one jostling behind me trying to get drinks.

The food, the menu, the decor - simple and rustic. Our waitress was very friendly and helpful, she shared with us the most popular menu items and how they were made.We started off with the apple cider doughnuts. I had read reviews prior to our brunch and found out that the apple cider doughnuts were a popular item to order at Hearth. The doughnuts were lightly glazed and topped off with a sprinkle of confectioner's sugar. I'm not huge fan of doughnuts, but these were surprisingly good. They were sweet, dense, and each bit had apple flavoring in it.Our friend had the Veal and Ricotta meatballs which was a dish recommended by our waitress. Our friend gave us a meatball and some polenta to try and it was fantastic! I really enjoyed the veal and ricotta meatballs. The sauce from the meaballs mixed with the polenta was like the perfect marriage. I've never had polenta before, but the taste and texture is identical to grits.Our waitress also recommended the Pig Trotter ""Fiorentina"" with Fried Eggs and my boyfriend ended up ordering this. The Pig Trotter ""Fiorentina"" is really just braised pig feet. I was a little bit jealous that my boyfriend ordered this because his dish tasted a lot better compared to mine and I love pig feet. The pig feet was cooked just right, soft, velvety.I ordered the Poached Eggs with Tuscan Kale and Pork Sausage. I found out about this menu item on Yelp. I like kale and I like poached eggs, so that's another reason why I ordered this dish. Unfortunately, I wasn't too thrilled with my dish. It came with two slices of toasted sourdough bread that was drizzled with olive oil and served on the side of the dish. The kale and shredded pork was a little too salty for me.

5.0,11/4/2013,"Came here with a bunch of friends and we have a veritable feast. The staff was extremely accomodating in allowing us to choose several dishes and basically served it family style over a series of courses. We got a chance to try a large majority of the menu and everything was really delicious. The atmosphere is inviting and cozy and the style of cooking was very reminiscent of Craft. Colicchip and Canora has a lot of similar techniques, common tastes, and plating. Lots of fresh herbs (Canora seemingly loves rosemary), family style platters and dishes for two, and of course sides plated in cast iron dishes. This is definitely a place you want to come with a large group. There are just too many great things on the menu.As for the dishes we tried:1st course- Charcuterie platter. This was a board full of different things- rabbit ballotine, foie gras, pig's head, duck prosciutto, and bread with thinly sliced lardo. The bread with lardo was my favorite part. Absolutely delectable. Since I am not a huge charcuterie guy I tasted the duck prosciutto and the pig's head which were tasty but I wanted to save room for the good stuff. Those in my group seemed to really enjoy it though.2nd courses- a. Ricotta sformato with chanterelle mushroomsb. 2 orders of quail with tomato farro and quail eggc. Sweetbreads marsalaTwo of Hearth's signature did not disappoint. Of the two, I preferred the sformato. I am a ricotta lover and this was like a ricotta souffle. Slightly warm, so creamy, yet light and prefectly balanced with the earthy mushrooms. The quail was also good, however I thought the tomato in the farro was a bit overpowering and kind of stole the spotlight from the quail, which was perfectly cooked and juicy. The sweetbreads were another great dish. Perfectly fried til crisp with a hearty creamy marsala sauce.Pasta courseVeal and ricotta meatballs with spinach cannelloniPappardelle with duck, olives, and rosemaryThe meatballs were really tasty. I am a bit of a meatball snob and usually have very high standards due to my Italian roots but hearth did a good job. The addition of the ricotta was very smart, keeping the meatballs nice and moist and adding a creaminess that was a different touch. The cannelloni was simple and just terrific. A great dish on a Sunday night. The essence of Sunday dinner Duck pappardelle was another winner. Perfect al dente, with slow cooked shreds of duck complimented by salty olives and of course it wouldn't be complete with a sprig of rosemary. Bottom line is they do pasta very well here. The common denominator is the dish was hearty, earthy, and comforting.3rd- This is when the meat courses began, and yes we were starting to get full.Roasted spatchcock chicken with calabrian chiles and spigarello. The chicken was a nice large portion enough for 6 of us to share. Crispy skin, tingly spiciness that was just enough without killing us. Extremely juicy on the inside. The spigarello are a rare green, a mix between kale and broccoli rabe. Not bitter at all and great accompaniment to the chicken. Great dish.A side of insanely good polenta rounded out this course. The polenta here is as good as I've had in the city. Just a little sprinkle of cheese and of course copious amounts of butter mixed in. Simple, yet incredibly delicious.4th- The crown jewel and the plate I waited for all nightCote de boeuf with bone marrow, bordelaise, caramelized onions and cabbageI have to say I am a hard to please guy with discerning tastes and high standards when it comes to steak. For this reason, I usually refrain from ordering it outside of steakhouses since most places EFF it up. But at Hearth I was pleasantly surprised. This was one of the better steaks I've had all year. You could taste the dry aging on this bad boy. So rich, so mineraly, so funky. I love my meat bloody rare but since I was with friends we reached a common ground of medium rare. Even so, this was cooked wonderfully. The bone marrow was delectable and added more to gild the lily and clog my arteries. Even the cabbage and onions were not an after though. Their sweetness was terrific with the steak. I was one happy man as my group allowed me to gnaw on the massive ribeye bone.The side for this was their infamous gnocchi. INSANE! Soft pillows of perfectly cooked ricotta gnocchi. You know bad gnocchi- those disastrous sticky gut bombs? These were not those. These were those fluffy gnocchi of your dreams. A MUST order.Desserts came next. At this point we were stuffed but theres always room for sweets. The best of the bunch was the sweet potato sundae with caramel sauce and brown sugar ginger snaps and the applie cider donuts with vanilla ice cream.

3.0,9/10/2013,"I was a little torn on what rating I should give Hearth because there were a lot of little scenarios that happened last night, some great, some not so great. I had an 8:00 reservation on a Monday night and when we walked in the place was empty. I like the decor, a bit LES rustic but the fact that no one was there was a bit disconcerting. We decided to sit at the bar which more often than not I prefer. They don't have a cocktail list per se just a huge ass wine list. I wanted a cocktail to end the day and start the night so I just picked from their list of Rye's and had the bartender make me a Manhattan. They state on their website that the menu changes daily but the one put in front of me was the same one I had been studying all week on line, totally fine by me. The bartender placed before us an amuse bouche of chilled corn soup which was delightful. We decided to split some plates and here's what we went with. To start we decided on the summer tomato salad with Sicilian tuna, celery, red onion, shell beans and basil. The kitchen split if for us in the back, major points, and the portions were sizable. I loved the tuna in oil that was added and the tomatoes were fresh and good.  The few pastas they had on offer all sounded good but we went with the Maccheroni with pork ragu, ricotta and rosemary and we definitely made the right choice. The noodles were definitely on the very al dente side, maybe just a touch too much but the pork ragu with rosemary had the most incredible flavor. This is a very hardy dish and even splitting one order had us both having more than half of our plates to take home. We also ordered the sauteed market greens and these were fabulous. The wine list is a bit intimidating for the size alone. I asked the bartender for a few suggestions and he was excellent at letting us try a few different wines and then suggesting a Red Bordeaux for our bottle choice. I'm remiss in remembering the name. It was perfectly fine nothing really to write home about. All in all this was a perfectly fine evening catching up with a girlfriend but would I make the trek back down to the LES to revisit?

Like the name, the place exudes the rustic ""hearth-y"" image. We received a dirty spoon upon ordering the oatmeal and was complimented with a set of coffee cake. However, both the Florentinas were rather salty, the grilled bread was salty and slightly cold, and the donut holes lacked sweetness and that melting-in-your-mouth sensation.

I started with a side of gnocchi as an appetizer, and it was the most amazing gnocchi I've had in new york. Followed it up with the veal + ricotta meatballs and my fiance had poached salmon.

It was so fresh and delicious and different that I'll definitely be back.Started the night with the lettuces plate, which is basically a super amazing fresh salad for two made up of lettuce, radish, peas, celery, beets, turnips, cucumber and carrots. Basically every vegetable you could think of. It was really good and very peppery, which I loved. Loved the farm to table aspect. I honestly felt like the veggies were picked out of a garden just for me!Continued with the fava bean salad, which was also just as amazing. Fava beans, pecorino and toast were filling and fresh at the same time. Got the tilefish and that was just alright. Still fresh, but not that interesting flavor-wise. Absolutely loved the garganelli though which was pasta with veggies and mint. SOOO good! Seriously I could eat this stuff all day. For dessert, we got the panna cotta and the carrot cake sundae, which was OUT OF CONTROL GOOD. Panna cotta had some really amazing sweet flavors, but it just didn't hold a candle to the carrot cake sundae, which was heaven in every single bite.Seriously, this place is fantastic. Of course, the service and atmosphere were as amazing. So, to repeat, get the lettuces, fava beans, garganelli and the carrot cake sundae for basically one of the best meals EVER.Ahhhh my mouth is watering just thinking about it.

The kale was slightly salty for my taste, but overall it was a solid dish (especially when you crack the poached egg open and the yolk comes ooozing out over the kale and minced sausage broth) YUM. Portions are average. I would recommend trying one of their grilled breads to start. Trust me, you will want to eat one all by yourself.

The service was terribly slow and our server seemed to disappear for extended periods of time.The chef sent out a sample soup which was nice so I will give Hearth points for that. We ordered the Quail as an appetizer to share and we knew that going into this appetizer there wouldn't be much, and we were correct. For the main course we ordered a $34 fish to share. Now normally the boyfriend and I share an appetizer, entrée and dessert and we are pretty satisfied. Unfortunately, this was not the case here. Two tiny medallions of fish appeared in front of us. While they were tasty I was starving after I finished my main course. I'm not one to usually complain about the portions being small. I'm not a big eater and i can almost never finish what's put in front of me. However, when I pay over $80 at a restaurant  I expect to at least be satisfied.

Despite that, the staff was extremely friendly to the point of uncomfortableness-not in a bad way but due to unfamiliarity. What was really neat about this place is that the sous chef came out and served us complimentary orange julius which was tangy sweet and refreshing. I saw him come out several more times throughout our meal as he helped serve customers. This is such a nice notion. I'm not sure if this is common but I do know that they just started serving brunch very recently so it might have been a way to establish their customer base.

Highly recommend this to anyone looking for something very classy while walking around the streets of NYC. Not your typical Village fare.,0,0,0,Diana C.,"Westbury, NY",1,21,3

In an attempt to properly welcome one of my best friends back to New York, I decided to take him to dinner at Hearth.HOLY BORDELAISE, BATMAN!Just get the Cote du Boeuf. It'll take about 45-minutes but get a few cocktails, maybe an appetizer. Or hell, get a really nice bottle of wine from their book and prepare yourself for some beefy goodness.

1.0,3/27/2013,"I just had the worst experience at Hearth. I was visiting from out of town with a friend whose birthday we were celebrating. As soon as we sat down and were served our appetizers, at least 5 different waiters came to clear our plates before we were done. This continued throughout the rest of our meal-- we were rushed the entire time. We gave them the benefit of doubt- maybe these were new waiters-- but the clincher was when Jared, ""the wine guy"" came by after we wrapped up dessert and informed us that there were people waiting to be seated and told us to leave. Meanwhile there were other tables open, plenty of room at the bar and hardly anybody waiting. Totally unprofessional and inappropriate wait staff, do not recommend.",2,1,0,Jennifer K.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,15,0
4.0,3/16/2013,"A restaurant like Hearth is a little out of character in the East Village. Dining here is very homey and comfortable in a classic sort of way. Waiters are attentive, seating is spacious and the menu features modern yet familiar takes on Italian American favorites. Because Hearth is so uncharacteristically traditional, it tends to get overshadowed by its flashier and quirkier neighbors, who have more appeal to the younger hipster crowd. The restaurant is underrated and totally undeserving of being so.The food at Hearth is ""rooted in the modern traditions of the American kitchen with influences from our Italian heritage,"" so expect hearty and robust Mediterranean flavors. A locavore ethos drives the menu, and the items change daily depending on the availability of seasonal, local ingredients. We ordered the arugula, fennel, and anchovy salad and the smoked Spanish mackerel for starters, both of which were excellent. (Be prepared for the intensely salty, briny flavors of the anchovy in the salad and on a lesser scale the strong, smokey flavors of the mackerel). We also ordered the whole roasted branzino. The delicious filet peeled cleanly off the bones, revealing impressive execution on the restaurant's part.Side dishes are usually an afterthought at many restaurants, but Hearth elevates them to the same star status as the main courses. The gnocchi was hands down the best item of the night. It was so addictive that the single table order quickly turned into a second. The dish can best be described as buttery mashed potatoes encased in a fluffy doughy casing. It's an extremely simple preparation that gets to the core of our hearty comfort food cravings.  The hen of the woods side order was also extremely tasty, featuring some of the best and most flavorful roasted mushrooms I have ever tried in recent memory. You'll find it hard to leave the warm and inviting mantle at Hearth as a pleasantly full and satiated house guest, but you'll always be welcomed back for equally memorable return visits at this gracious restaurants.",0,0,0,Sherry J.,"Manhattan, NY",82,35,23

4.0,2/19/2013,"Valentine's Day.  Dinner in the neighborhood we both call home, with an upscale twist, at a spot we've both walked by and said ""we should try that place soon.""I would've liked to see the regular menu, as I could've gone to town on some extra pasta varieties, but it was pre-fixe only.  That ended up being great, as it forced me to try a wider variety than the slow-cooked ragu & fancy-cheese stuffed ravioli i'm always attracted to.  The amuse-bouche set the scene for a creative menu - a beet soup with horseradish creme fraiche.  SO good - I'm not used to hot beets, but I like it, and a creamy, spicy finish.  Loved it!  Followed by the first course - a duck terrine with grilled bread and some sort of pine nut & pistacho jelly. Only needed a bite or two. The grilled bread was strong enough to stand up to the almost liquid-soft terrine, so it pulled everything together.On to my favorite - the gnocchi with lobster and black truffles.  Lobster was buttery...gnocchi like mashed potatoes...could've gone heavier on the truffles. Next, a lamb with carmelized onion and assorted winter vegetables. I could've skipped this one, but I do see the merits - very rich, and almost tasted like a winter stew.  Then, a double round of dessert - mascarpone with pomegranate seeds & a pecan cake with hazelnut ice cream.  I've never tasted anything like the hazelnut ice cream - it was so intensely flavored, it was almost confusing.  Tasted so much like the nut,  you were surprised it didn't crunch.Wait staff was polite, prompt, etc - on their Valentine's day best.  It was certainly on the pricey side, but is an impressive island of upscale Italian in a subset of the EV mostly ruled by a grittier vibe.",1,0,1,Emily R.,"Manhattan, NY",452,361,4

It wasn't that they were distasteful, it was that they were lacking taste. It tasted like simple matter and no flavor.

4.0,1/19/2013,"Went here for a reunion dinner with two friends. Decided to order several starters, entrees, and desserts and split them all. The majority of the dishes we ordered were amazing and flavorful.The menu is seasonal and changes frequently, but here is what we ordered. To start, we had the Grilled Seasonal Vegetables and Octopus Carpaccio. The Grilled Seasonal Vegetables were great, though nothing spectacular. They were grilled perfectly and tasted fresh, while the ricotta on the side of the bowl added flavor. Nothing spectacular though. The Octopus Carpaccio, on the other hand, was absolutely amazing. Savored every last bite.For our entrees, we split the Veal Meatballs with Spinach Cannoli and the Hen of the Woods. The Veal Meatballs were just good-tasting meatballs. And the Spinach Cannoli was good if you really like Spinach (which I do), but again, nothing spectacular. For dessert, we ordered the Orange Creme Brulee, Chocolate Panna Cotta, and a scoop of Sweet Potato Ice Cream. Creme Brulee is my favorite dessert, and to be honest, this one was sub-par. But the Chocolate Panna Cotta was absolutely amazing. It was rich and there was a salty addition to it that played the sweet/salty complexity to the fullest. The Sweet Potato Ice Cream was great as well.Overall, the food was great.

I have to spend a few minutes trying to grab the attention of anyone to let them know I couldn't eat my food. They apologized and brought out a replacement of roasted squash. It was delicious, but come on, the original dish was a decent sized hunk of fish and you give me a couple pieces of squash instead? Lame. The pacing of the meal was awful. We waited up to 15 minutes between courses...and when you're talking about a 7 course meal...that's a long dinner. Like...running out of things to talk about long...By the 5th course we were struggling.

Typical reaction of when I ingest gluten.Well Thanks to Hearth, the waiter and the person who answered the phone when I made the reservation  I've been in bed and and sick all night and day...because I ingested gluten and the ignorance of the staff in not taking serious allergies!So I called the restaurant a day later to check again how they make their gluten free pasta, and I was told, ""we make it on the same machine we make our regular pasta"" I'm like what?????? I'm confused I called and asked for gluten free and NO ONE including the waiter told me that you make it on same machine, which means cross contamination!!! Wow, they really take it serious here!!Thanks for getting me sick!!! So please read again!!! If your celiac stay away!!IT IS NOT GLUTEN FREE!! Even though they call it gluten free! It is not safe to eat!! They misinterprate the term gluten free without considering people allergie!!!!.And please restaurant read the guidelines to call something gluten free!!!If you call it gluten free then you must know, it's prepared in a separate area where there's no cross contamination!!! Or if you can't do that, call your fake gluten free pasta, rice pasta since its made of rice!!! But please in no circumstance call it gluten free!!! Inform all of your staff!!!You can only call something gluten free if you take precaution not to have cross contamination!!!! Everybody knows that!!!So disappointed!!

5.0,11/25/2012,"Hearth: a word whose Teutonic origins cause both those who speak it and those who hear it to conjure visions of stoked fires and sweeping, wooden eaves. It is no wonder then that in this house that comfort built, chef Marco Canora focuses on rustic simplicity and pronounced seasonality in his menu. I tend to find that heavily seasonal restaurants peak in autumn, given the timing of various harvests and crop cycles combined with our instinctual nature to seek out richer, heartier sources of sustenance. Given the opportunity that M's birthday presented, taking her to Hearth was an easy choice to make.Nestled into an unassuming corner of East 12th street, with only a swath of brick gilded by a back-lit steel sign to mark its entrance, Hearth exudes a certain confident charm. Upon catching glimpses of merry diners through the expanse of windows, you will see that Hearth's confidence is not foolhardiness. On entering, the swath of brick from the exterior morphs into a tableau that envelops the restaurant and the adjacent bar. Copper pots hang dramatically on the wall, gleaming under what feel like individual stage lights. But that is where the drama ends, for this is a place of comfort. The lights are dim, the seating is plush, and the tones are hushed. Though they were few in number, the large groups that were present were mercifully quiet, not boisterous. This is a restaurant for a tête-à-tête, not a girls' night out before making the dubious stumble into the Lower East Side. After M arrived, the maître d' seated us along the aforementioned wall of brick, leaving us with our thoughts and our devilishly enticing wine menus. The connection Hearth holds with Terroir becomes immediately apparent at their first perusal. If a country produces wine, it will likely have a place on the menu. Having planned not to drink that night, the well-curated list proved a formidable test of my conviction. Though I ultimately won out, I would surely ask for a pairing on my next visit.When our waiter, his madras shirt alone further evidence of the unpretentious, cozy nature of the restaurant, came with our menus for the evening, we were presented with equally difficult choices. The entire bounty of fall seemed to be represented on it. We decided to start with a salad of warm autumn vegetables, and a plate of a sort of ricotta terrine with fall greens. The vegetables were absurdly fresh and shone through their light dressing, enhanced by their warmth. The ricotta was fluffy, creamy, mild and sweet. In short, everything a good ricotta should be. For our main courses, I chose the braised rabbit, while M chose the poached cobia. Her cobia arrived, steaming from the kitchen, with matsutake mushrooms, farro, and brussel sprout segments strewn beneath it. As a finishing touch, mushroom consommé was poured over the proceedings. The expected and realized traits of the consommé could describe the dish itself; earthy, light, and subtle. The farro and brussel sprouts were necessary pillars of firm texture, holding the other elements together. My braised rabbit was cooked wonderfully, and the bones intact presentation seemed to heighten the pastoral flavor profile of rosemary, olives and sofrito. The accompanying polenta, while a bit heavy on the rosemary, was equally agrarian, though it was served in lovely copper pots. In retrospect, I rue not partaking in the tasting menu. Seventy-six dollars for several courses of this caliber is a steal. But I digress. Being a birthday dinner, in spite of our mutual lamentation at the thought of consuming still more food, we ordered dessert. My apple cider donuts were like none other I've had, in the best way possible. Flaky, yet dense and cakey, paired with the lightest of whipped cream, they were heavenly. When M's pear tarte tatin came bearing a birthday message ascribed in chocolate, I was grateful at the demureness with which it was handled. No awkward requests, no secret parlance. Just a restaurant performing a kind gesture. That the tarte itself was a luxuriously sweet vehicle for the ever so slight acidity of the pear was merely an exclamation point.Hearth, like many restaurants in New York, does not receive the attention it merits. It, and the homeyness it evokes, are taken for granted in the constant desire to seek the new, the bold. Let the bold and the new clamber over one another for the titles bequeathed by the scene-seekers. Yet and still, Mr. Canora's creation, now approaching its tenth year, lives, and we are all the luckier for it.",20,11,14,Jordan S.,"Manhattan, NY",865,273,672

One of the highlights was their attention to the ingredients. Everything is hand selected and the farms are noted on the menu as well. Menu changes on a regular basis ensuring freshness. Started wit the Autumn vegetables. Great presentation and delicious flavors while still allowing the vegetables to come through on their own. This dish was Fall in a bowl. Arugula and fennel salad was delicious and refreshing- however I thought the anchovy flavor came through a bit too much. For main I had the famous veal and ricotta meatballs. I was reluctant to order these because they seemed so basic - something you can get anywhere - however the server encouraged me and said anyone who comes to hearth needs to try these. He was dead on. I cant even begin to comprehend how he packs so much flavor into one meatball. Sauce is perfect and the accompanying Cannelloni was cooked perfectly. Wine list was plentiful and reasonably priced.

5.0,10/23/2012,"A visit to NYC is not complete without sampling a great restaurant and HEARTH is a home run!  Impeccable service in a cozy and warm setting.  My boyfriend wanted to splurge on a nice dinner for us in the East Village.  We walked around and saw this unassuming resto.  I am so glad we followed our instincts and walked in.  We were seated immediately with a gentle reminder that they need the table back by 8:30pm, which was understandable.  Upon seating we were treated to freshly baked bread with butter and a lovely amuse bouche of split pea soup in shot glasses.  Yummy.  Now here is where the service gets great.  This resto has sacrificed tables to have service tables scattered through out the resto, to be able to set-up tables and service diners that much more quickly.  That is admirable for a resto trying to compete in NYC.  We ordered wine from our server following his recommendation.  We did not like the wine and when we waved for a wine menu, an extremely helpful gentleman from the front came over and attentively listened to our wine preferences and gave very good suggestions on our next wine selection.  Throughout this whole conversation he has imperceptibly held a wine bottle behind him so as not to distract us.  It's a small gesture but overwhelming with grace and consideration.  After we settled on the wine he decanted it for us.  Throughout this whole time our server did his best to apologize for his recommendation , which we assured him that it was our decision so he is not to blame.  Incredible food.  We had the ribollita which melded together so beautifully and tasted like crisp outdoors in the fall.  It was warmth and earth in a bowl.  Complex flavours in a soup that has simple ingredients.  We could have had that soup all evening.  But we decided to share the 20 oz striploin, which melted in our mouths.  The meat tasted like sweet grass which the cow, where our beef came from, has been grazing on.  It was sweet and tasty and unbelievably tender.  Our steak came with delicious roasted potatoes, crunchy but soft and pillowy inside with a side of greens.  We were so full but we ate through our steak because it would be a sin to leave it.  Our wine also whetted our appetite for more meat. At the end of our meal, they comped us for the wine and never bothered us for not leaving at 8:30pm, which is more than we expected for a fine restaurant.  So my pleas to all of you is please come and support this great resto so that they could continue doing what they are doing so very well.  Feed people wonderful food close to the hearth.",1,1,0,Lara P.,"Toronto, Canada",92,348,191

2.0,10/5/2012,"Came here in a group of seven people last night. Had heard very good things but was completely unimpressed. Service was simply a disaster -- they didn't screw anything up, but for what they charge, they have to be more on their game. We shouldn't have to wait 10 minutes after being seated to be asked if we want water, we shouldn't have to sit ignored for 20 minutes after finishing our main course to have our dirty empty plates removed, and we shouldn't have to dance through three different staffpeople to get a bottle of wine ordered. Thankfully, the hostess/sommelier were kind enough to send us some dessert on the house after I complained -- which is all that we can ask for at that point -- but it's not enough to make me want to come back.Food was good but not great. Vegetables seem to be the strength here as the heirloom tomatoes in my burrata appetizer were delicious as were the sauteed greens. The lamb entree was overcooked, although the merguez and spiced smoked rib with which it was served were great.Lots of good restaurants in the city, many more reasonable and on-point than Hearth.

Waiter simply stated that its a 7 course meal chosen by the chef as stated on the menu. Clearly I get that but it would be nice if he tried to sell it to me or tell me what the courses are. At the end of the meal we ordered tea which took 15 minutes to bring out. Its just boiling water, how hard is it?My dinner party was 5 ppl. Intially we ordered the items listed above minus the lamb.

5.0,8/31/2012,"Went here for my friend's quiet birthday dinner and decided to splurge on the tasting menu and a $200 bottle of amarone which was INCREDIBLE.  I think our waiter was impressed.  The restaurant itself is dark, red and very romantic.  Great date spot!First up on the tasting menu was fava bean salad with spring onion, pecorino toscano and parsley.  Not quite enough toast to go with all the beans but the olive oil they were doused in was so flavorful.  Next was the porcini trifolati with ricotta sformato, gremolata and grana padano.  I HATE mushrooms which is pretty much what this dish was but as always I insist on at least trying it.  Turns out it was delicious.  The mushrooms were crispy and covered in herbs and the cheese added another layer of texture so I actually ended up thinking it was pretty good.The olive oil poached swordfish with freekah, pickled ramps, snap peas and trout roe with not quite flakey enough but the sauce was great.  I do like my fish drier than most people though so it could've just been me.The pappardelle with pork ragu, rosemary, peas and ricotta was obviously a huge hit with me considering this is one of my all-time favorite dishes.  The pasta was very fresh, there was plenty of ragu which is a major plus and the ricotta was soft and sweet.Next up was the Colorado lamb with roasted lamb, spiced-smoked rib, merguez sausage, peas, carrots and cilantro which was very good but not spectacular.  Too much ""extra"" not enough meat.Our first dessert dish was poached rhubarb with rhubarb soup, frozen yogurt and pistachio which was a little too much on the rhubard (the soup was kind of weird) but the yogurt was refreshing.  A for effort though!This raspberry bomboloni was the BOMB-oloni (sorry had to do it).  It was so soft and melty and sugary.  A delicious end to a lovely dinner.  I left the restaurant feeling VERY content.",0,1,0,Laura H.,"Sydney, Australia",412,394,3
5.0,8/29/2012,"Awesome wine dinner last night for Summer of Riesling at Hearth. The food was excellent, from the octopus appetizer to the suckling pig presse. Great risotto, too, and a fun cheese course, all paired with Burklin-Wolf Rieslings, including a great vertical with the 3rd course. Service was great, even the hostess who remembered our names to take us to our table. The dinner was $95 all inclusive and I thought that was a great deal for 4 courses and 9 wines - definitely check out one of their wine dinners. Be warned that it's pretty noisy at the long table they do for their group dinners, and elbow space is first come, first serve, but after a few glasses of wine, it's all good! ;)By the glass list here has a great variety, and an extensive wine list (didn't expect any less).

5.0,8/15/2012,"In a word: AMAZING!  Hearth is my favorite restaurant in New York and I will tell you why.  I have been to Hearth several times, and most recently in early July when our friends from San Francisco were in town.  We wanted to show them an amazing dining experience and as such, brought them to Hearth.  As we had a drink at the bar before dinner, I noticed Marco Canora himself come out of the kitchen.  I have a major staring problem and he noticed, but as  opposed to being annoyed, he made a point of coming to our table, introducing himself (as if that is necessary) and talking to us all night!  It was truly a once in a life time experience.  So let me start with the sommelier  (I think his name was Jared), who made the perfect recommendations to go with every course we ordered.  Our waiter (i cant remember his name) was lovely.  So personable and sweet and really made us feel at home.  The most amazing part was getting food recommendations from the chef and having him tell us about every course as he served it.  It was wonderful. Now let me tell you about the food,  The gnocchi melts in your mouth  I am not exaggerating  it is like nothing I have ever eaten in my life,  The hen of the woods mushrooms were delicious, and the chef sent us out some meatballs to taste - which were delicious.  The entrees were equally as spectacular.  All in all it was one of the best dining experiences I have ever had and the chef and staff really are one in a million.  I cant say enough good things about this place.  If you are in New York it is a ""cant miss""  Marco Canora even posed for a picture with us at then end - he was simply lovely.  Thank you Hearth for a wonderful, delightful evening!",0,0,0,Valerie D.,"Brooklyn, NY",14,40,1
1.0,8/6/2012,"I had some friends in town and I wanted to take them here after seeing all of the great reviews posted.  The restaurant was half empty on a Saturday night, we should have taken a cue from the start. It's not that the food is THAT expensive, after all it is Manhattan. I just expect to the food to be at least decent, considering a well known  is responsible for the ""cuisine"" there. For example:My girlfriend ordered the Salmon ($32) which had a pleasant taste to it, but she was  only given 3 bite sized pieces with an accompaniment of mixed greens.  I on the other hand had the roasted pork loin ($30), Not only was the portion small, but it was very chewy and hard to eat. It had no semblance to being roasted, rather I think it was pan fried to save time.On top of it all the waiter was constantly on top of us to make sure we were drinking and would become visibly upset when we said no to him. I understand a waiter's job is very stressful at times, but than again a lot of people have stressful jobs.Needless to say I was very embarrassed to bring my friends here and I won't be returning.",0,0,0,Leo M.,"New York, NY",11,1,0
5.0,8/5/2012,"Fantastic service, great ambiance, inventive pairings, and a delightful wine list. Highly recommend. We started with the Turley rose zinfandel (aka, a white zin! gasp!) which was super interesting and paired really well with the scallop carpaccio. The wine was dry, balanced, and had just the right amount of spice and ripe strawberries. We then tried the 2009 Grittermatte Riesling from Julien Meyer in Alsace. Slightly oxidized, funky, a crazy mix of sharp acidity and rich, saline, roundness from the oxidation. Perfect with the poached snapper in ham consumme. Finally we tried the 2009 Damiano Ciolli Silene made of Cesanese (from ~30 miles outside Rome in the Lazio region). This wine had all the rugged earthiness of an Italian red on the nose, but the palate was perfumed florals, dried herbs, and softness.

4.0,5/6/2012,"I encountered Hearth incidentally, and was surprised to be familiar with the Terroir line of interesting wine bars but not the cozy Italian restaurant opened by the same owner.  The spirit is much the same, sophisticated but not attention-seeking.  Hearth is warm and inviting, a charming restaurant with an especial flair for seasonal produce.  And indeed, they are an excellent locavore destination.  Hearth is the unmarked brick restaurant on a corner of 1st Avenue and E 12th Street, with windows that are doors, causing many a prospective diner to try them unsuccessfully before finding the real entrance on E 12th St.  The entrance has a cozy bar area/waiting area, one end of the long, brick-lined dining room, contemporary touched by rustic.  The adjacent Terroir wine bar can be spotted from the entrance.As expected with the Terroir connection, the wine list is extraordinary.  They take pride in having an eclectic international selection, and after leafing through some of the menu binder, I decided to leave selection in their capable hands and have a wine pairing, which was so well done, it was an easy choice to do so again on the second visit.  I've had wines from countries I didn't know wine was produced in (Canary Islands?), but its not just for show, the pairings were excellent and enhanced both wine and food.  Our waitress was friendly and enthusiastic, and I enjoyed her descriptions of all the wine pairings.Let them take you on a 7-course tasting tour (amuse bouche, two first courses, fish, meat, pasta, and two desserts), or build a meal from a straightforward menu divided into the same categories.  The tasting tour may feature selections from the a la carte menu, and they'll accommodate if you simply must have something specific included.  I dined here only a few weeks apart and having the tasting menu both times, I wondered whether the experience would differ.  It seemed so, with only two courses shared. Over these visits, beginning with an elegant shot glass of delicious, warm soup, I was elated to find food prepared simply, highlighting the freshness of the ingredients, sometimes startlingly so.  In particular, I found the piquant fava bean salad to be a wholly perfect dish, with flavors both rich and sharp, textures smooth and crisp, each bite a revelation.  Pastas were complex in flavor and delicious.  Fish courses were well-prepared but the better one was paired with another vibrant salad of grains and greens.  Indeed, not to overlook meats but I was most memorably and consistently impressed by the non-meat foods at Hearth.  Likewise, although desserts were quite good and well-made, they did not inspire the same excitement.I enjoyed my tasting tours at Hearth, and am very fond of this under-the-radar restaurant with excellent food, wonderful wines, and welcoming atmosphere.  I am sure I will be back.",0,1,0,Valery C.,"Forest Hills, NY",56,837,9616

4.0,5/3/2012,"I can't believe it took me 5 years of living in the East Village before going to Hearth.  It's definitely an expensive night but worth it.  Prior to the meal, there was a lot of strategizing between the gf and I about how we would attack the menu here.  They offer a chefs tasting for $76 which I am typically inclined to do so that I can try as many dishes as possible but because some specific items caught our eye, we decided to order a la carte.  The wine menu is huge so there was a lot of deliberation about whether or not we wanted to order a bottle or just get individual glasses.  I'm not a connoisseur by any means so a large menu scares me.  We decided to order by the glass and asked our waitress for recommendations.  She did an EXCELLENT job.  We were both extremely happy with our choices.  I got the Domaine Le Roc Des Anges - Segna de Cor 2011 which was delightful.While we were looking over the menu, the waiter brought us a tasting of split pea soup, compliments of the chef.  I know that everyone gets this but it's still a nice gesture from the restaurant.  It was served in a shot glass and had a couple drops of lemon oil on top.  The soup had a strong smoked flavor from the pork that it was cooked with and the lemon oil added a welcome zest.  A great way to start the meal.  We started off with the Sea Bass Crudo.  They brought us each separate dishes with three pieces on them so that we didn't have to share off one plate in the middle.  That was a nice touch.  This dish was fantastic.  The pieces of raw fish literally melted in my mouth.  They were drizzled with oil and had a touch of roasted red peppers on top.  Dynamite.We then split the Cresta De Gallo pasta with pork ragu.  This was unbelievably flavorful.  Again, they split it up so that we each had our own bowl.  The pasta was cooked al dente and the sauce was chock full of meat.  The peas added great color and texture and the dish was topped with a couple dollops of ricotta which added a creaminess to compliment the rich pork and pungent tomato's.  We savored each bite like it was our last.  For our entrees the gf got the Red Snapper and I ordered the Colorado Lamb.  I tried the fish and thought it was pretty good but I liked the lamb better.  There was so much to the dish it was almost overwhelming.  The lamb was roasted to a perfect medium rare but that was just the beginning.  There were a couple pieces of spicy merguez sausage and a smoked rib (off the bone) which tasted like a BBQ dish.  I don't know that all these items worked together perfectly but I enjoyed eating them separately.  I probably would have ordered the Braised Rabbit with polenta if it weren't for two people.There's always room for dessert so we got the smores sundae.  The ice cream was actually smoked marshmallow flavored which was pretty crazy tasting.  Each bite tasted like I just took the marshmallow off the fire.  Overall, we had a great experience at Hearth and I'll definitely go back.  Maybe for the tasting menu next time.",1,0,1,John D.,"San Francisco, CA",127,218,34

He really wanted to try the wines they had here (having a good wine list does not equate to having good food). It would not be a restaurant I would've picked to go to, except it was his birthday. I ordered the lamb and ricotta meatballs - they were definitely pretty generous with the portions. It came with 4 big meatballs, and 2 spinach cannelloni's. I could definitely taste both the lamb and ricotta in the meatballs, and while they were not bad, I think I much almost preferred Ikea's Swedish meatballs. Those are definitely a lot easier to eat. The spinach cannelloni was cooked well and was tasty. For $30 a plate though, I thought it was pretty overpriced.For dessert, i got the s'mores sundae. I think this was my favorite part of the meal. It came in a sundae glass, and the marshmallow ice-cream was delish.  I almost gobbled up the entire thing, but was too full. We also shared a Barbaresco - my friend's choice. I'm definitely not a big wine drinker, but it was pretty good. Not sure about $115 good though! And lest I sound cheap, I'm definitely willing to splurge on good food, but I definitely felt the value was not there. We ended up spending about $110/each for a main, dessert and a glass of wine.

2.0,4/3/2012,"While Hearth has been getting quite a lot of buzz recently, I will say that if you factor the ""hype"" along with the price tag, Hearth is by far a sub-par experience. I would certainly have rated this three stars had I not heard such great things.#1 The ServiceOn a Friday night, this place is packed, and to Hearth that translates into the fleeting attention of a pretentious hipster waiter. On the flip side, I will say that Hearth is chock-full of helpful B and C level wait staff (i.e. your food runners, bus boys etc.). and our waiter did have a good grasp on the wine list. But ultimately, the service left much to be promised; with large gaps of time between ordering wine, our first and second courses, and paying the bill. I think we were in the restaurant for three hours, and with a party of four that's pretty much unacceptable.#2 The FoodTo start our table ordered the Grilled Quail with Farro, Carrot, Leek, Quail Egg, and Tomato. The Quail was a tiny savory nugget of deliciousness, but sadly, the bed of farro and tomato that it was tenderly laid upon was bland (farro) and made NO sense with the flavor palate of the dish (tomato). We also ordered the Grilled Florida Octopus with Potato, Celery, Smoked Black Olives and Aioli, which was awesome. The flavors worked really well together, which is more than I can say for it's appetizer counterpart.For entrees we had   Poached Florida Red Snapper with Smoked Ham Consommé, Green Garbanzo Beans, Peas and Spring Onion- the consomme was served in a large wide bowl which meant that after pouring, the broth became cold within minutes. Rookie mistake. Otherwise the dish was mediocre at best.The Lesso Misto with Chicken Thigh, House-Made Cotechino, Short Rib and Veal Tongue. Apparently this was very tasty, althought sadly, was not my dish. I did sample the house-made cotechino which was pretty tasty. Roasted Chatham Cod with Smoked Chickpeas, Tuscan Kale and Baccalá- which was reportedly uneventful at best.  And the Veal and Ricotta Meatballs with Spinach Cannelloni. This dish was really delicious and most definitely kept us happy for the evening, the meatballs were perfectly textured and balanced, and the cannelloni was subtle and played the necessary supporting role to these meatballs. Unfortunately, giving me three meatballs and a 3 inch cut of cannelloni for $30 is NOT going to win me over.#3 The CostFor two bottles of wine, two appetizers and four ""decent at best"" entrees, to charge $315 BEFORE tip is absolutely outrageous. The food and the service were not good enough to back the price. And the wine we chose from the wine list were on the cheaper side of what Hearth had to offer. Kind of an overall bummer given the accolade Hearth has received.",4,0,1,Samantha P.,"New York, NY",126,136,27

The complimentary warm chickpea soup with lemon oil was delicious. I ordered the arugula salad with anchovies, pickled onion and fennel which was fine, not knock your socks off. For my main course I had the smoked and roasted cod with kale and chickpeas. Very smoky and cooked well, but I have to admit I was definitely jealous of my dining partners veal and ricotta meatballs. They were awesome and the portion is generous. This is a good place for a date or dinner with the parents - but If you're going with older people I recommend going on the early side- we arrived at 730 and by the time we left after 9 it was very very loud.",1,0,0,Gillian K.,"New York, NY",259,145,3

I don't want to give it away, so you will only find out if you go there and check it out!  The ambiance is great for a date here and I will be back (with a man of course) hopefully in the not so distant future.",1,2,2,Julie G.,"London, United Kingdom",677,999,19
4.0,3/7/2012,"Had a lovely dinner on Saturday night.  We didn't have a reservation but the hostess was kind enough to accommodate us with a warning that they needed the table back in 1.5 hours.  It was 7pm and the restaurant was busy --- we didn't leave until after 9pm and they did not mention that they wanted us to vacate the table at all.I've been to Hearth before, and I knew what to expect: a delicious meal with good service.  The restaurant looks different than the way I remembered it in 2005/6.  For a more intimate feel, I'd suggest a table by the kitchen, with the bench on one side.  The other side of the restaurant seems better suited for groups, louder, and more energetic.  There were also about four seats at the kitchen counter, it's a bit bright there for my liking, but if you don't mind it, it gives you a unique vantage point of the exciting action in the kitchen.  They have an extensive selection of wines, but we went with the cocktails instead, the drink list was filled with thoughtful concoctions.  We had the commander henry hudson and the navigatir abacuk pricket from the winter cocktails list, they were both smooth, mature and complimented the food perfectly.  We had the warm winter vegetables, I loved the combination of textures and flavors, the buckwheat honey ricotta and then pumpkin seeds went surprisingly well together.  Since we were at an Italian place, I suggested that we try a pasta.  The cresta de gallo was absolutely delicious.  Then we shared the braised rabbit, again, another winning dish, prepared expertly with olives and polenta.  One thing I learned tonight: trust Marco Canora.",2,0,2,Jenny L.,"Queens, NY",95,191,288

4.0,3/6/2012,"I've been to Hearth twice now, and I've really enjoyed both meals.  The food is very good, definitely above average, but is short of excellent.  What really pushes this up to a 4 star review is the staff and service.  When I came in for my second visit, about a month after my first, you would have thought that I was a regular.  It was remembered that I had dined here before, that we had the tasting menu, what wine we ordered, who I was with, etc.  We were sent a complimentary round of pre-dinner drinks, and a complimentary dessert by Fred.  Not sure if Fred is the manager or sommelier, but he knows his stuff, and is very friendly.  Also, the place is huge, compared to most new American places in East Village (Beagle, Northern Spy, etc).  To me, it's that level of service and atmosphere that sets Hearth apart from its competition.  Yes I could go someplace else for slightly better food, but I'd rather eat at Hearth in a comfy room with pleasant servers, rather than crammed in between 2 other parties being served by a moody, eye-rolly, hipster d-bag. The braised rabbit is very good, but missing something to give it that extra ""wow"" factor.  It's on the menu as a shared dish for two, but I was able to order it for myself.  Probably the best dish I've had there was the pork chop, closely followed by the chicken dumpling soup.  The wine list is very good, and the Tonos Prima Terra was an excellent choice by Fred on our first visit, and we ordered it again on the second.  They decant wine into Erlenmeyer flasks, which the chemist in me really appreciates.  And the fact I was able to correct my tablemates that it is not a beaker helped my undeserved superiority complex for the evening.  I'll be coming back again soon, I could see this place becoming a neighborhood favorite.",1,0,2,Clifford R.,"Manhattan, NY",50,169,8

What's funny is that my BF generally doesn't like Italian food, but both times we've been here, he said it was the best meal he's ever had.  The food was so good, we bought the cook book right there and then, and Chef Canora was nice enough to sign it for us.

This corner restaurant was busy with a rustic décor seemed like it was worth a try. Even without reservations, the hostess was very pleasant; checked and placed our party of 4 at a leisurely wooden agrarian looking table that could have accommodated 6...yeah!The restaurant was lively, full of people enjoying their food. It was not too loud where we had to scream at each other across the table. Our server was very helpful and attentive without hovering.We ordered cocktails from an extensive book of whos whos of wine, beer and any other alcohol that is produced on the planet. Cheers to that with the unique drink mixology was a good start. The cuisine here went for a rustic touch that in some cases worked and other was okay. The grilled quail was nicely done as was the grilled octopus. The Ribollita was a letdown from what I'm familiar to the Italian version.  The salmon plate was quirkly presented in 4 chunks  lightly poached morsels that was underseasoned. Our other courses fared much better pork chop cooked perfectly medium rare.  The cod was light and flakey, the Canestri - a solid swordfish like texture was a bit odd too me. The pork ragu was the clear winner of the bunch that really spoke of the rustic theme of the food here.With a pleasant décor,  food by locally grown with and interesting take on comfort food Hearth is certainly where the home is but don't forget your wallet because after eating here rustic is what your account will look like.",0,0,0,David N.,"Brooklyn, NY",123,631,903

2.0,12/18/2011,"Should be 2.5 stars, not just 2 stars.I read many reviews on Yelp about this place after being taking to Hearth for a special occasion in December.  Frankly, my experience was quite a distance  away from what most other persons report  on this web site about the place.  This comes from a person who has dined at many top restaurants in NYC, the Hamptons, Hawaii and San Francisco and who is a very good cook. Let's start with service.  When service was around, it was very good and friendly. But for a considerable amount of time, especially for quite a while after we sat down, we were like persons in a raft in the middle of an ocean.  Food.  I strongly dislike places that have severs that serve bread one piece at time for a while and then disappear. The place falls into the category. I had to ask for olive oil. I never use butter. The bread crust was tough--almost like day old bread.  The main course and appetizer menu didn't excite me even though I know the food is  locally sourced and seasonal. I chose the quall (very tasty) and duck (rare and cut into small pieces, not the way I like duck served). Good but some pieces were tough to chew.  One of the persons had an excellent salad, pears, lettuce, walnuts. One person had a fish dish as a main course. It was supposed to be a hot dish, but was served  cold. Back to the kitchen it went. When it was returned, it was overcooked but had great sauce. Since it was late (after 11 pm), that hungry person ate the meal and then complained to our server, who told the manager. He came over to our table and apologized for the messed up meal and took the cost off the menu,  which was nice.No tablecloths. Very surprising considering the prices. Wine/beer. Great selections of beer (no boring American beers, like Bud),  but some are over $20 (in very large bottles). The wine book is very unusual in terms of data presentation, but offered some good selections in a variety of categories.  About 7 or 8 red wines by the glass and about the same amount of white wines by the glass.  More wines by the glass selections than many other NYC restaurants but still smaller than many West Coast restaurants. I prefer French Bordeaux.  But there were none in the red wines by the glass list.  I asked a server (sommelier came around when we first got the wine book but never came back) for something like French Bordeaux. She advised the most expensive red wine by the glass. It was very good. Ambiance.  Quite loud due to large number of persons there.  Even though there was a speaker over my head, fortunately no music came out of it until we were about to leave.  About the table set up, tables for two in the main dining room are along the walls. In the middle, are tables for 6 or so. This makes for a noisy environment if you are sitting on the sides. Like at least other reviewer, I really didn't like the décor.  Blood red on one side, exposed brick on the other. Could be improved to give a warmer and more cozy and country look/feeling.  Teas.  This place does have a good tea selection and they are all loose leaf teas.  That to me that is very impressive since most places in NYC serve bagged tea.  However, the tea was brewed in the kitchen and served  much too hot.  I had to wait about 5 to 10 minutes before it got cool enough to drink.Desserts.  A bore.  Very surprising and disappointing. They included donuts. For dessert!!??  We instead choose to have desserts at a very excellent nearby Italian dessert place. Will I go back? Maybe for a different menu and some beer.  I will eat at the bar.",0,0,0,Morgan H.,"BOWLING GREEN, NY",0,2,0

WOW!Fantastic food.  I HEART HEARTH!Every course brought ""WOW"" and ""NOM NOM"" and ""YUM"" noises.We tried the octopus with petite diced potato, celery, smoked black olive, and garlic olive oil.  The octopus was so soft, I could cut it with a fork.  Next up was the housemade charcuterie.  Excellent choice!  Usually I don't enjoy charcuterie, yet this one I enjoyed.  Everyone at the table had a different favorite item, so it is a fun course to share.  It was shared by 4 perfectly.  The standout for me was the rabbit terrine.  I could eat a vat of this.  Without any exaggeration, this was the best terrine I have ever eaten in my life...and I have eaten many, many terrines.  This is definitely something I will be craving for years to come.  My main was the veal and ricotta meatballs.  The spaghetti was perfect.  It had teeth to it and was perfectly al dente.  Usually, most restaurants can not get this right.  I nearly cried when I bit into a very mushy pasta at Lidia Bastaniach's restaurant.  They got it right at Hearth though.  The meatballs were amazing too...what flavor!  My friend ordered the pappardelle with boar ragu, rosemary, soffrito, and chestnut.  It was the star of the show!  Amazing complexity with only a few ingredients.  I guess the quality of the ingredients does matter, more than the quantity.  This dish was unbelievable, and I hope to be able to return someday to devour it.  My other friend ordered the duck.  Perfectly cooked.  Quality meat.  He seemed a little disappointed in the size of the main.  My husband had the pork chop.  I thought he was going to divorce me on the spot and marry this pork chop.  I cook a lot, and usually don't spring for expensive cuts of meat.  I guess it really does matter.  I took one bite of this pork chop, and understood immediately why it does matter.  He offered to let everyone try out his dish, but clarified ""try this! It is amazing!  But don't take too much!"".  LOL.  We all died laughing.  I was beyond full. The men were not full, so I guess it varies. Perhaps the pasta dishes are more filling.  The service was outstanding.  Friendly, prompt, helpful, attentive.  Our wine glasses and water glasses were always full.  We were not rushed, yet attended to perfectly.  Making reservations was easy.  They are on opentable.com, which is the best website ever created.  I personally wish ALL restaurants would be on opentable.com.  I had to call to change our reservation an hour before the time slot, and they were very nice about it.  I hate when you give a courtesy call to a restaurant to change the head count and get attitude.  Hearth's reservationist was very nice about, and even seemed a little grateful for the heads up.  We noticed that the crowd seemed older.  We are all over 40, so it was relief to be the company of people our age, instead of surrounded by 20 year old hipsters, chasing the latest scene.  My only two complaints would be the decor and the price.  I did not like the decor at all.  The room was painted blood red, with practically no decorations or pictures.  The chairs and tables were ugly.  A farm to table restaurant could do so much better.  They could install a Hearth in the main dining room.  The tables and chairs could be more rustic- wood would be beautiful.  Farm tables would be cool.  The red walls should be covered with brick.  It could be more homey and comfortable, rather than stark.  The decor is clearly an afterthought here, and could use a little work.  I noticed what looked like a chef table in the kitchen.  This looks like such fun!  I would to try this one day.  And the price.  Sigh.  Unfortunately, the price it way to high to be a regular dining experience.  Dinner came out to $420 for 4.  That included 4 mains, 1 app, 1 sharing plate, 3 coffees, 2 glasses of wine, and 2 bottles of wine.  I suppose if we stuck to one bottle, we could have kept the price down.  Mains are $30 on average.  We ate like royalty, though.  It was worth every penny.  Still....waaaaaaaaa.  I want to eat here again, and it is just too pricey.  Quality ingredients DO matter.  Coupled with terrific cooking skills, and you have a phenomenal meal.  One the highlights of my dining year.",0,0,0,susan n.,"East Rutherford, NJ",5,308,234

To start we had the seasonal roasted vegetables with honeyed ricotta. The presentation was original and the cheese really made the dish. I ordered the roasted cobia with farro and mushrooms. The dish was salty and the mushrooms overpowered any taste of the fish. My friend got the duck, which was a better choice. The sauteed greens we got as a side weren't anything special.

A note: all dishes were really well seasoned- so if you like bland food you'll automatically think this is over salted- overseasoned etc. if you like bold, strong flavors, you will lick every plate ordered just like i did.Amuse bouche:Cranberry bean soup- hearty and creamy- great start to warm up from the cold outDishes to share section:Braised Rabbit with olives and polenta- Entire rabbit- so succulent and soft the meat fell off the bones in this tomato-based sauce with all these different types of olives i never knew existed- so delicious and pretty; the polenta had lots of rosemary, it was aightSidesGnocchi- pillowy potato-y bites of heaven- might be their signature dish since I saw it on everyone's tablesAutumn roasted vegetables- MY FAVORITE part of the meal- the best vegetables I've had in my life- parsnips, turnips, carrots, pearl onions, fennel, butternut squash, leeks, brussels sprouts etc. all roasted and seasoned perfectly Dessert:Apple Cider Donuts (2) with apple compote and maple whipped cream- (as seen on foodography with mo rocca) a perfect soul-warming finish to the mealService:BF: Babeme: yea?BF: is this one of those Michelin starred restaurants?me: no why?BF: because they sure act like itexpressed after fresh bread and butter was constantly and instantly replenished without notice- like ninjas in the night. incredible service was upheld throughout the meal- with all the staff we encountered.Ambiance:another yelper said it best- not too loud, not too dark, not too crammed- perfect environment for the right kind of energy for a great experience.

I had the Grilled Octopus as an appetizer and the Roasted Hampshire Pork Chop with a side of Hen of the Woods as a main course. Both were amazingly delicious - the octopus was fresh, light and perfectly seasoned. The porkchop was perfectly cooked and juicy, and the Swiss Chard Gnudi that came with it were an interesting take on using swiss chard. The cocktail I had (I forget the name) was the best cocktail I've had in NYC. While small, it smelled smoky and amazing, and was very strong. Others in my group had the Roasted Muscovy Duck, Papparedelle, Grilled Quail and all of the salads offered. Everyone loved their dishes as well as the red wine the server recommended.

The chef owner, Marco Canora, was second on the Next Iron Chef last year beating out more famous chefs. We have been many times and think the food is fabulous. Really enjoy the pear cider to start in the fall. Great wine list thanks to co-owner, Paul Greico. We frequently ask the staff for recommendations and they do not disappoint. Have to have gnocchi - the best anywhere and I have spent a lot of time in Italy etc. All the pasta is superior - vegetable lasagna -melts in your mouth.  Fava bean and pecorino salad is  irresistible.  Cacciucco is the best fish strew any where - can never get enough.  Panna Cotta always delicious as is the Pear Crisp and Sorbet...Cannot wait to go again.",0,0,0,Marion F.,"Wilton, CT",0,2,0

The swordfish had very little taste at all to the point that I know I was eating fish only because of the consistency. Even the polenta lacked flavor.

They have some really great selection of beer on tap and bottled, but their wine list wasn't huge. It was interesting though, I noticed one that was featured which was boxed wine (brings me back to the Franzia chugging college days where I'd just pull the bag o' wine out of the box and squeeze it down my gullet) but the sommelier explained that just because it comes in a box doesn't make it shitty wine. I agreed but stuck to wine from a bottle. Call me old school. Oh and the name of the bottle alluded to the Dick in a Box Justin Timberlake SNL skit song which we found pretty entertaining. The food was very well done, presentation and taste were on point. I really like the ambiance of the restaurant as well. It had red walls and was quite lively but not too loud to where we could hear the next table (or worse, they could hear us) but still loud enough to have the night amount of energy.

5.0,9/1/2011,"The very best veal ricotta meatballs (with perfectly cooked fresh spaghetti and a fresh and tangy tomato sauce) my husband and I have ever had. Also, the very best potato gnocchi we've had -- comes with just a touch of pasta water, butter, sea salt, freshly ground black pepper and freshly grated Reggiano -- simply sublime .... they're so velvety that you don't actually chew them, rather they melt. My tilefish and fresh (head-on) prawns were well-cooked and perfectly seasoned and came with a sweet corn, blanched grape tomatoes, yellow and zucchini squash and a touch of tarragon. The fish skin was perfectly crispy yet the fish moist and flaky. We were also given the warm pickled vegetable salad ... so good, even my husband ate it. It has fresh wax beans, green beans, discs of fingerling potato, red onions, and cauliflower. It's tossed in a well balanced warm vinaigrette. I started with the Philadelphia burrata with marinated market vegetables. The cheese, the only glitch in the evening, had too much hardened ""skin"" on it and too little of the creamy goodness inside. The vegetables, roasted red peppers and eggplant were good (okay, I hate eggplant, so I can't speak to whether it was good or not, but the peppers were good and the arugula which came on the plate added a great texture and nuttiness). We finished with a lovely ""neopolitan"" trio (not on the menu as such, but mixed and matched some of the sorbet and ice cream selections) of chocolate chocolate chip ice cream, strawberry sorbet and vanilla ice cream. The chocolate ""chips"" are special in that they are hollowed out so when you bite them, they crunch and dissolve in your mouth along with the creamy goodness of the chocolate ice cream. The vanilla ice cream was vanillay and creamy as get out. The strawberry sorbet ... holy crap ... it had the bright freshness of my nana's strawberry freezer jam, only sorbetized ... simply the best I've had. Wonderful wines -- a sparkling Riesling (they have a huge Riesling selection and are now apparently known for among other things, their ""summer of Reisling"" selections). We then enjoyed a not too big but flavorful Guigal Ex Voto Hermitage and finished with a surprisingly crisp and delicious sparkling Domaine de Martinolles Blanquette de Limoux from the Langedoc.   I had never had this sparkling wine before but would certainly have it again for its hint of mild sweetness and crisp bosc pear flavors.I sat mesmerized at the end of the kitchen bar and got to ask all of the questions that came to mind (probably not supposed to do that, but I tried to be conscientious not to disturb the chefs while they were actively working on a dish).  Turns out one of the chefs is engaged to a fellow whose family is from Seattle and that she had worked with Chef Jason Franey who is now at our favorite Seattle restaurant, Canlis, when they were both at 11 Madison in NYC ... small world.Outstanding service -- I can wholeheartedly say they made us feel special.

All of the food is fresh and I believe where possible they use local and sustainable ingredients. Besides the ambiance and service, the food is phenomenal. The quail is delicious, grilled perfectly and tastes delicious. The salads are always fresh and the perfect starter. Usually, I have ordered the roasted fish of the day for 2. The fish of the day is roasted whole, stuffed with lemons, garlic, thyme/rosemary and served with roasted potatoes, roasted fennel and onions. The fish is served whole, bones in, but they do score the meat so you can easily remove it from the bones. Sides of hen of the woods or seasonal vegetables can't be beat. The desserts are also simple, but delicious. If it is on the menu, you must try the apple cider donuts. They were unbelievable. Served warm, right out of the fryer (?)/oven - they were glazed and delicious! the peach tart was refreshing and scrumptious as well. All in all, Hearth always is a home run for me.

I liked the menu because it made you think and order outside of your comfort zone.  My""go to"" order--flank steak or something, was noticeably absent from the menu so I went with the Pork tenderloin.  It was cooked with some nice root vegetables and big thick bits of bacon.  It was great. My wife and her friend ordered the brick chicken for two (we're also of the school that you don't eat chicken when out to dinner).  I tried the chicken which was flavorful, tender and juicy-- another home run.For dessert I ordered blueberry shortcake with blueberry ice cream  and I tried their chocolate mousse with ricotta sorbet.  Both were well done and tasty.  The ricotta sorbet was a unique touch.I don't have any complaints, per se, but I have a few nitpicky comments.1) What the heck was going on with the red wall coverings that looked to be furnished from an old library?  They were warped and awkward looking.  I know they were used as sound dampeners, but they have to go. The brick and exposed beam motif was tarnished by the wall covering.2) Our sommelier must have recently finished his wine certificaiton course because he used every adjective in the book to describe the wines...jammy, fruit forward, strawberry, terrior, oaky, hints of tobacco, leather, and musk.  Are you kidding?The restaurant is in a great LES neighborhood with plenty of pre and post dinner options.  I'd go back.",0,0,0,Tom O.,"New York, NY",94,50,13

1.0,6/21/2011,"I went to Hearth on a beautiful Saturday evening. When I go to a restaurant that identifies as a farm to table place, I go for the vegetables to see where they are coming from, and clearly the chef at hearth is coming from a place of HIGH blood pressure. We all ordered salads to begin with and all of them were salty to the point where thought I was swallowing water in the red sea on a birthright trip to Israel. Gross. Not yummy or stylish by any means. In addition to the excessive use of salt, the vegetables were not good quality. They didn't have that crunchy bite of sweetness you get at, let's say, Blue Hill NYC. After my salad, I wasn't expecting anything good to come.I was happy when I my side order of Gnocchi came to the table. I always order gnocchi hoping I'll like it, and this time I did. Yes, they were light, fluffy pillows of mildly cheesy potato goodness that melted on the tongue. But, this was not enough to win me over by any means, you ain't fooling this girl. I don't even remember what I got as my main course. Lastly we ordered dessert. It was good but nothing I couldn't cook. The cookie plate was not creative and some of the cookies were dry. The chocolate chip cookie was the kind with too much flour and granulated sugar...bland. Also we ordered coffee and milk to come with dessert and the service brought it out way before dessert came.That brings me to the service. In addition the claiming to be farm to table, hearth prides itself on its service. Sure everyone was nice and my water was constantly being refilled. But the place didn't have that extra warm feeling; I didn't feel special, or heard. I didn't like hearth if you can't tell. I would not recommend spending money here.

They also brought us shooters of beet soup with creme fraiche to taste which were great. Unfortunately, my salad was super salty, and she was great about taking it back and bringing me a beet salad instead.  The golden beets were quartered while the red beets were cut thinly and wrapped around creamy gorgonzola-decadence disguised as healthy, perfect.  I then followed with the roasted black cod, which was excellent, although the portion was a little bit small in comparison with other plates.  Nate sampled the mixed meat dish, which had everything from chicken to tongue, and enjoyed it thoroughly.  Gabe and Kristin attacked the whole striped bass from Long Island and with Gabe's butchering skills even managed to extract the highly coveted cheeks.  The other three people had the various pasta dishes, and all looked fantastic.  Due to the abundance of bread, we were too full for dessert, but opted for espressos which were rich and deep.  The red and white wines that accompanied our meal were equally delicious, and we had a great time.  A true neighborhood gem.",0,0,0,Lama B.,"Brooklyn, NY",229,592,50

One time for the carrot cake and one time for the Apple Cider Doughnuts."" ::hiccup::Although I won't reveal the identity of my very pleased dining companion, I will say that we had a fair amount of expensive wine by the time she reached that climactic dessert proclamation. Located just a hop, skip and a shuffle away from my residence, I pass Hearth on a daily basis. I also pass their sister wine bar, Terroir, where we had originally attempted to go before ending up at the bar at Hearth which didn't have a wait - yet. Finally sitting inside the simple, low-lit foyer of this Iron Chef household, I was a bit wary at the start. The menu is simple; generous in quality and high in price. A bit torn on how to order from the small plate menu, we decided to share the $30 charcuterie. And we began on the wines: a Spanish wine recommended by the bartender for me and the glass of Chianti for my companion. Two glasses later and we were smearing duck pate, homemade mustard and headcheese on thick-sliced garlicky bread and giggling away. Four glasses later and we were ravishing the aforementioned desserts with an inebriated zeal. We watched Chef Marco Canora leaning idly in the corner watching patrons and gossiped with slurred fanaticism. After a final glass we paid our $100 each and walked out into the night very pleased with ourselves. Realistically, Hearth should be nestled in the high sixties near the Park rather than nudging the bums on 1st Avenue. The prices, the atmosphere and the quality are all high end.

3.0,3/7/2011,"I found out about Hearth after watching last season of Next Iron Chef on Foodnetwork. Marco Canora (owner of Hearth) was in finals but lost to Marc Forgione (owner of Marc Forgione). They were both very good, just had different styles of cooking. Canora was known on the show for more tradional italian food. But after I went to Hearth, I don't think his menu is all that tradional, it's more modern-tradional cooking. Anyhow... I'm not easily impressed when it comes to famous restaurants. I'm not impressed just by the name or reputation unless food matches all the hype. I found Hearth not bad but it wouldn't be on top of my list for trendy/italian food. The place itself is warm and pretty - good lighting. It serves any occasion, whether it's a date, work lunch/dinner, casual dining etc. I wasn't crazy about the neighborhood though. I don't really hang out there and there isn't much to do in the area before or after dinner.  My coworker suggested a wine bar right next door called Terroir Wine Bar. Canora actually owns it too. So if you don't want to show up for your reservation too early and want to have a glass of wine ahead of time - that bar might be your best choice.

5.0,2/16/2011,"Just when I was giving up on NYC restaurants again.. I was amazed to have such a perfectly delicious meal at Hearth last night.  My bf could not have surprised me with a better place.  The quail appetizer and beet salad - perfect.  The best beet salad I've ever had - I've never seen farm fresh beets that look like cherry tomatoes- and the gorgonzola the chef uses is the best I've ever had.Same with the mushroom side dish - which was not too greasy at all and the pappardelle bolognese sauce- everything about it was perfect.. Puts Marea's pasta to shame!I had the scottish salmon - the most moist fish I have ever had and the capers and olives weren't too overpowering as they can sometimes be.My only complaint- the salmon portion was much too small.Only when the meal is this good, do I order dessert.  The pannacotta was delicious - perfect amount of vanilla bean flavor.  My only complaint- the fruit it was served with made too much water/liquid in the bowl.  The chocolate pudding cake with the banana ice cream - divine.Finally, an expensive restaurant that I can actually give 5 stars to on my blog.  (yes, this beats Convivio).To end the perfect night, we realized we were seated in the back near where the health inspector was going over his report with the chef. When finished,  the chef happily waived his poster with a big A on it.  We were kind of hoping we'd get a celebration shot or something on the house but at least the chef got his perfect rating, for a perfect place.",0,0,0,Alexandra C.,"New York, NY",854,2017,62
3.0,1/31/2011,"Hearth is certainly an appropriate name for this East Village restaurant - it's warm, inviting, comfortable, red, and a safe haven from the blustery cold outdoors. I'll admit, however, I was not entirely excited upon viewing the menu beforehand. Typically, I appreciate places that offer just a few items, but in Hearth's case, nothing exceptional was catching my eye from their limited selection set and I found myself playing price police to determine which dishes were really worth the relatively high costs.When all was said and done, I ordered the Lesso Misto at $30, a broth-filled assortment of meats that included short rib, chicken thigh, house-made cotechino (pork sausage), and veal tongue. The dish also came with a trio of condiments - a horseradish blend, salsa verde, and crystallized fruit compote. My favorite was the last of the three, and featured quite the zing when paired with the outstanding cotechino - also my favorite out of the meat crew. Additionally, I'd never had tongue of any kind before, let alone that of a baby cow. Regardless, the veal variety tasted like meat-flavored mashed potatoes. That's a good thing.Their portion sizes certainly reflect their overall philosophy of not wasting food. That's not to say they are too small, but you could probably order two appetizers and get more bang for your buck than with an entree alone, and several members of our party did just that. With a group of ten, and three bottles of wine between the bunch, the check was split at $55 per person, which, all things considered, was really not that bad at all.Our waitress was super knowledgeable, but the service overall was rather slow, and I was asked by a dude carrying a basket around the establishment approximately eight times during the course of my meal if I wanted more bread. It's like in Asian restaurants where they fill your glass of water after every sip and I find myself chugging the water in some silent challenge with the server. Except I couldn't really do that with bread. Hearth wins this round.What would bring me back here was what I found in their downstairs bathroom. Now, I understand that this sounds a bit creepy, so allow me to explain. Along the walls are framed menus, a wide array of previously offered selections given Hearth's seasonal rotations. Many were personally more appealing than the current Winter list, including a Monkfish dish I would've been all over had I been given the option / entered a time machine. By this rationale, I would anticipate Hearth to accommodate all tastes - it's just up to the diner to figure out which season works best for them.",5,3,4,Dan R.,"Brooklyn, NY",633,551,148

I will explain later) but it just isn't at the level of restaurant that it is trying to be.  If it was cheaper and less hyped it would get a 4.The good:Service Staff - Our waiter was fantastic.  Great personality and a desire to give a great experience.  Generally everyone we interacted was top notch.Atmosphere, decor, crowd - Definitely a ""cool"" place with a nice vibe.  Love hitting Terroir for some wine beforehand.  (May just skip Hearth next time.)The okay:Food - Just wasn't blown away.  Maybe our expectations were too high and also we didn't get to eat what we wanted.  (See below)The bad:For lack of a better description, Inventory Management - We had a late reservation.  That was the only time they could fit us in at the last minute.  We arrived at 10 and were clearly the late sitting.  They sat us down and gave us our menus and we ordered.  We were not rushed.  When 2 of us ordered the meatballs and spaghetti he told us they were out.  So, we both switched our orders.  They were also out of the side that we wanted.  Five minutes after we ordered he came back and told us that they were also out of my ""back up order"" and what one of my friends had ordered.  LIterally they were out of 2 of the 3 meat dishes and 3 of the 4 people at my table didn't get their first choice and I didn't even get my second choice.  Disappointing.  I know you are trying to hold down on wastage, but... that is a little extreme.Needless to say, we were disappointed.  We were also disappointed with their reaction.  They gave us a free side.  I am not the person asking for free stuff, but...  That just doesn't fix the situation.  You want to be a top notch restaurant, then you have to do a little better than that.Overall, a nice place but you can do a lot better for your money.",0,0,0,Kevin C.,"Brooklyn, NY",144,37,0
5.0,1/23/2011,"It was through watching ""Next Iron Chef"" that I became aware of Marco Canora and his ability to produce mouth-watering dishes that looked so tantalizing on my TV screen.  I felt he was a shoe-in to win the competition, being so intrigued by his dishes and his general likability.  I would have never predicted his eventual loss to Marc Forgione (a chef whose food I tasted before and was actually repulsed by).  I really felt he was wronged.  Regardless though, I wanted to try out Hearth as soon as possible, as I knew I was going to be in for a good meal -- and I wasn't disappointed!Dinner began with an attractive amuse bouche, a shot glass of Tuscan bean soup.  There was a lot of great flavor that was captured in this small sample.  I thought it did a great job to raise expectations for the food to come.  For the appetizer, I went with the red wine braised octopus ($16).  What a delight it is to eat properly prepared octopus!  The texture was perfect, and the dish boasted a lot of flavor.  The soft, suppleness of the octopus was contrasted nicely by the diced celery and diced potatoes.  To temper the wine, fresh parsley, black olives, and a lemon aioli were additionally incorporated.  Enjoying this progression of food quite well, I was becoming reminiscent of my travels in Italy.  Not bad at all.    For the main course, I had the cacciucco ($30).  This is one of my favorite dishes in the world, and I was happy to see Chef Canora do it justice.  It's a cornucopia of delights from the sea.  This rendition included striped bass, mussels, Manila clams, ""head-on"" shrimp, and calamari.  It can be tricky to get it just right.  Ideally you want to have the taste of the ocean in each of the ingredients, but you also want the spicy tomato sauce to bring the elements together.  That execution of harmony and good taste can be difficult to come by, and this dish was an excellent study.  This is really comfort food at its very best.  The reduced sauce just begs to be sopped up with bread, and those ""head on"" shrimp are gorgeous to look at and even better to taste.  So delightful, this dish can not be missed.  We were so overcome by our unexpectedly good dinner, that we actually passed on dessert.  We were full and savoring the taste.  As we proceeded to the front to claim our coats before leaving, guess who was seated by the hostess?  None other than Chef Canora himself!  It's not often you have the chance to personally thank a famous chef for their wonderful contributions.  He was so amiable and friendly, chatting us up.  I thought to myself, this is a great place!  Truly the best food that East Village has to offer, and yet the ambiance is decidedly laid-back and casual.  I really like that balance.  Highly recommend.",9,3,11,Jim U.,"Washington, DC",690,1303,3044

2.0,12/21/2010,"There were four in our party.Started off with drinks at the bar.  They were quite simply amazing.  They were the highlight of the evening.  Really expertly crafted flavors came together delightfully in the Jefferson Rozefort (Rum) and the Ian Fleming (Gin).Once seated, we had the tasting menu, 7 courses for $72.  We had a vegetarian in our party, and at first they said they couldn't accommodate us on the tasting menu without making us all have a veggie tasting, but then they said they could.  As it turned out, most of the dishes were veggie anyway (5 of the 7), not sure if that would have been the case without the veggie in our party.  But I digress slightly.Starting off with the wine...the server's knowledge was abominable.  We let her select, but suggested we'd like an old world, medium body, perhaps a Rhone or Chateauneuf.  She consulted the sommelier, and came back with what she said was a ""Burgundy from Rioja"".  Now, we are admittedly winos, but this characterization is just an oxymoron.  We thought perhaps she'd brought us a Pinot Noir from a non-designate area of Spain close to Rioja...or something like that.  Nope, it was a straight up Rioja.  When we asked her why she called it a Burgundy...was she referring to the style?...she had no idea what we were talking about.We started with the amuse bouche described elsewhere in reviews...a bean soup.  Nice, but not remarkable.We then had a starter salad of beets with frisee.  It was very nice.  We all enjoyed it.This was followed by a garbanzo dish done 3 ways - a puree, some whole garbanzos, and some fried garbanzo skins.  Not that interesting, and a lot of beans considering the amuse was beans as well.After the garbanzos, we had a cavatappi with sage.  Ok, nothing to write home about.This was followed by a cod steak done quite nicely, very flavorful, with a slight crisp on the skin.Next was a sorbet palate cleanser that counted as a course, which seemed odd to us.Our main course was a skirt steak, beef heart, beef tongue, marrow medley served in a beef broth.  The marrow was savory and delicious.  The skirt steak was nicely served.  The tongue and heart were interesting, but again, not super flavorful or cleverly seasoned.The vegetarian in our party had a plate full of squash for her main.  It didn't look very attractive, and she didn't enjoy it.The dessert was a total disappointment - a dry doughnut with a little apple and cream.  Just uninteresting.  Not worth the dessert calories.We ordered a second wine, again letting the server choose (based on prior interaction, probably a mistake, but she said she would ask the sommelier again).  She brought a Lebanese wine, and when we asked her what grapes were in it and in what percentages, she looked like a deer in the headlights, and started fast talking, which made it clear she didn't know.  Why she didn't bring the sommelier over is beyond me.Overall, we were just not very impressed given all the press the restaurant has gotten.  I have a work colleague that raves about Hearth, and he is a big time foodie, so we are left to surmise that our tasting experience may have simply been compromised with the vegetarian requirement.Might try again, but won't hurry back.",0,0,0,E P.,"LA JOLLA, CA",1,5,0
5.0,12/16/2010,"Okay, so I admit it.  I was prompted to try out Hearth due to my secret (or not so secret) crush on Marco Canora.  I did watch him on the Next Iron Chef and I decided that it was time for me to stalk him and go to Hearth to try out his food in the hopes that he would be there on the night that I was there.  It was blistery cold out that night, but we managed to make it into the warm and toasty doors of Hearth.  I was taken with the decor as I walked in.  The hostess took our coats and without a reservation, we were seated promptly at a cozy little table for two.I  have to admit, I wasn't really that excited by the menu when I took a look at it online, it's not a vast menu by any means, very compact and nothing really jazzed me from just browsing it, but my love for Marco outweighed my curiosity and I carried on.  Anyway, we had a very nice waiter who explained to us the specials and I asked him if Marco was in the house that night and he said yes.  ""Ohhh!"" I squealed, much to Jim's chagrin :)I decided to skip having an appetizer and went with the Scottish Salmon Olive Oil Poached with Carrots, Leeks, Ginger, Trout Roe with a side of purred mashed potatoes. We were given a delicious amuse bouche which was some type of pureed bean soup. I wasn't sure what type of bean it was, but it was fantastic. This definitely did it's job of wetting my appetite for my main course.  When it arrived, I was more then ready to dig in. It smelled delicious!  With each bite of salmon, a burst of flavor infiltrated my mouth.  The salmon was perfectly seasoned and cooked.  All of the flavors infused the fish and the ginger really gave it a taste I hadn't quite experienced before.  Okay, the potatoes:  WOW!  I think these would have to qualify as the best damn  mashed potatoes I have EVER had! Seriously! They just melted on my tongue with the perfect balance of salt and butter and the consistency was silky smooth.  What a delicious pairing for my salmon!As we wrapped up and got ready to go, I approached the exit completely satisfied and to my delight, there sat Chef Canora himself!  I ditched Jim and ran up to him gushing with praise and delight lol  I shook his hand and told him I was a fan, blah blah blah and thanked him for a wonderful meal and dining experience and assured him that I would be back to stalk him..I mean eat there again in the future.  He was friendly and pleasant, just like I had imagined...this was the perfect end, to a perfect meal!  I think the only thing I would critique about Hearth is that the volume was pretty high in there.

I made reservations ahead of time and we got seated next to the kitchen which actually was pretty cool. It was great getting to watch Marco in action. I convinced my dad to order a glass of whiskey with me. We got Laphroaig and I specifically asked for 2 ice cubes in my glass and nothing more - just to cool it a little rather than water it down- but the guy put a bunch of ice in there. I politely asked him to take it back, which he was more than happy to do, but he just brought it back with less ice but still more than 2. I decided to just let it be rather than having him take back a 2nd time. Overall, not a huge deal but I tend to save my 5 stars for impeccable attention to detail.

For a starter we got quail that was so delicious I wish I could have eaten it for my entire meal. My parents split a whole fish, it was black bass that evening, which was cooked very simply with lemon and i think some herb. It was cooked perfectly.

While others at our table ordered a la carte, I opted for the ""NY Craft Beer Week Meets Eat Drink Local Week"" menu -- 3 courses each paired with a different beer (served in a bottle, with no glass).The clam and cauliflower chowder was good, but not very well balanced -- the smokiness and saltiness of the bacon dominated the dish, overwhelming the brininess of the clams and delicate flavor of the cauliflower. Fire Island Red Wagon IPA was average -- thin and somewhat bitter.The braised veal breast with roasted greenmarket vegetables was a serious letdown. It was described by our waiter as a roulade of veal breast, cooked overnight to melting tenderness, with a crisp cap of crackling. What arrived was a solid hunk of meat -- thick, flavorless and tough (literally difficult to cut and chew) -- with a 1/2"" layer of unappetizing, uncrispy fat covering the top. It was served over some polenta with small bits of roasted vegetables strewn about. This came with Fire Island Lighthouse Ale, which was full-bodied and good.Dessert was gala apple crisp with honey ginger ice cream. Served in an individual oval ramekin, the apples were not fully cooked, and the ""crisp"" was more of an unbrowned crumbly top which tasted dry and a bit floury -- it just did not seem to have been baked long enough, perplexing in a restaurant of this caliber. Accompanying Fire Island Pumpkin Barrel Ale was overly heavy and bitter without counter-balancing sweetness.Our waiter was knowledgeable and engaged, helping us select a good and reasonable red from the long (and generally overpriced) wine list.Given Hearth's prices and positioning, I expected much better food, and doubt I will go back.",0,0,0,J.

I really really enjoyed the house made mustard that came with the pork terrine. Yum! Also the warm bacon vinaigrette on the salad was f'ing delicious! The beans and the swiss chard were excellent accompaniments to the the pieces of roasted pig and the dessert at the end, simply music in my mouth. So good! My friend and I also added the $18 wine/beer pairing. I had wine, she had beer. I think the beer was the better choice. I didn't dislike the wines they gave me, but I didn't particularly love any of them either and because of that, I didn't quite enjoy the pairings as much as maybe someone else? Simply put, I'd rather have had the beer, or water water throughout and a coffee with my dessert. Then again, I try to be classy, but sometimes that just doesn't happen. Sigh. It's tough being true to yourself. Otherwise, I really enjoyed the music played during our meal--a great eclectic mix of world and classic rock. I also really enjoyed the set up of the tables in the space. The wait staff was excellent, as well. I would definitely return for next year's pork roast and maybe even on a date not coinciding with pork roast time.",0,0,0,Sara S.,"New York, NY",60,105,0
3.0,8/2/2010,"Disappointed is one word I would use to summarize my experience at Hearth. I read a lot of reviews online about Hearth and I wanted to take advantage of their Red Sauce Sundays. I finally got here and was excited to try out their food. But I ended up being quite disappointed. With the Red Sauce Sundays, you get an appetizer, an entree and a dessert. I got the caesar salad, meatball pasta and Espresso over vanilla ice cream. The caesar salad was good but I mean you can't really go wrong with caesar?!? The meatball pasta is just plain. The sauce is lacking seasoning and the meatballs are not even simmered enough to grasp all the flavors as they should have. Unfortunately, I think the best of my dishes is the dessert. Espresso was strong and vanilla ice cream tastes artisan. My boyfriend's dishes were slightly better. He got the shrimp scampi and they were pretty flavorful but again they are small portion and really just shrimps and nothing else. The panna cotta was creamy and milky soft. Again, this is probably the highlight of his meal too. I won't pay $50 per person for all these. Service was outstanding but not enough to make up for the lack of flavor.",0,1,1,Athena C.,"San Francisco, CA",1008,1619,761
5.0,7/17/2010,"We went here for our wedding anniversary. Everything was perfect.Not wanting to splurge too much even for a special occasion, we picked the cucina povera menu, a three-course prix-fixe ($35). We got the wine pairings to go with (3 good-sized glasses for $15). Prix-fixe deals can be disappointing because the rest of the menu hints that there are greater things to be had. But this combo hit all the right notes.The chilled zucchini basil soup was creamy but light and topped with a delicious basil oil and pine nuts. The pork tortelli were in a very flavorful broth with a little bit of kale. Pig explosion. The dessert was panna cotta with candied almonds. I LOVE panna cotta. All three wines were interesting and delicious and I would never have had the good sense to pick them out for myself nor the opportunity to pay so little for them.This is the kind of place where you have a waiter but really everything in the restaurant is looking after you. For example: my husband's napkin got folded when he got up to go to the bathroom; I arrived schlepping too much stuff and the hostess checked my bag to unburden me.The only downside was a particularly loud and obnoxious woman at another table. Here's a hint: please do not sing over dinner in public. But there's nothing the waitstaff could have done to chill her out except start feeding her, after which point she was quieter.Bonus: as an amuse bouche they served a shot glass of chilled fennel soup. My husband loves it when you get a treat at the beginning of the meal. They have a ginormous binder of wine and other alcohol offerings, which we did not delve into because of the pairings, but I'm sure you could find whatever you wanted here.We went on a Thursday night and made reservations on Tuesday via Open Table without a problem. We were going to a show at 9 in the Theater District and didn't have any time crunch (we started at 6:30).Perfect for a special occasion.

5.0,7/12/2010,"My boyfriend and I had reservations here last Saturday. We were a few minutes early but we were promptly seated. We both tried one of their special cocktails - I had a Madame Talein and my boyfriend had some mezcal with maple flavor. For food, I ordered fava beans with pecorino cheese and my boyfriend had the uni salad. His salad was fresh and simple, unmarred by complex flavors so that the uni would shine. My fava beans were so bright and light. For the main course, I wanted fish but I was not familiar with the textures of 2 of the fish. I inquired to the Waiter and he gave me his descriptions of the two fish and then I was able to make my choice. Our Waiter was enthusiastic and informative and the entire waitstaff was alert and seamless in their work. My boyfriend had veal with sweetbreads and he gave me a bite. It was DELICIOUS!!! I almost regretted getting fish. Almost. Then for dessert I picked a semifreddo that was citrus based and he picked the dark chocolate cake. We did this intentionally so we can pair something light with something heavy. They were both so, SO great. I actually wanted a white wine with the fish so the sommelier came over because he saw me glancing at the wine list and asked if I was interested in anything and what entree I was about to have. I told him and he recommended a riesling from the Fingerlakes. It was such a smooth and fruity wine. I loved it. I loved my experience.

I had the quail to start, which was superb, though the quail egg could have been a little bit more runny (really, you have to nitpick to find ANYTHING wrong with this place) and then the meatballs, which were perfect. EV, if you think $26 for ""2 meatballs"" (they were served with ricotta ravioli as well) is too expensive, you're at the wrong place!

Each element of the dish was good by itself, but if you piled a little all together on your fork and got a lot of the buttery sauce... wow, amazing. But my entree, the veal and ricotta meatballs, was just okay. It was good but not great -- too much meat, too much cheese, which made it too salty. I had a hard time finishing one meatball. I also ordered a side of the hen of the woods mushrooms. They charred the tops of the mushrooms which gave it a barbeque-y taste. Interesting. For dessert, the apple cider donuts with a cup of coffee was comforting and a good end to the meal.

My favorite part.  Grapefruit parfait or ""Little glass of heaven"" as I like to call it.  The perfect amount of sweet and the slightest bit of tart.  Layers of extremely light white cake, creme and grapefruit placed delicately in a glass and topped with a tiny scoop of grapefruit sorbet and a surprising (delightful) speckle of poppyseeds on top.  I want one every day.Another element that I liked about this restaurant was the space between tables (a luxury) AND the option to sit up next to the prep kitchen which I'm keeping in mind for next time.",0,0,0,Cat Y.,"Reston, VA",34,169,1

I'd gone to Terroir an year or so ago and enjoyed it. We had reservations for 9pm. I was pleasantly surprised that they seated me, even though I was the only one present in my party of 7. I'd just gone to the gym and ravenous. ""Would you like iced water?"" ""Can you bring bread please?"" ""And would you like iced water?""They put bread on each person's bread plate and were very vigilant about refilling it. The butter was creamy. I got the Tomas Estes cocktail to start.

It took a while for our entrees to come. We're not sure why, as the place was totally emptying out. My entree was the striped bass cacciucco. It comes with calamari, cockles, fennel, and leeks in a tomato based broth. I was not impressed with the broth; it was too salty. The bass was moist and flaky with a broiled skin. Two friends shared the whole roasted fish which was pretty good. If you've never been served a full fish with head, don't be alarmed. (And the cheek meat is my favorite). Another friend ordered the saffron lasagna and were shocked at the portion size, so make sure you ask when ordering. Another friend went with the Cucina Povera prix fixe menu.

3.0,3/4/2010,"Went to Hearth last night for dinner and the ambiance was great. There is a bar table near the kitchen that you can sit at to ask the chef what his thoughts are when he prepares the food. That in and of itself is worth a visit to eat at Hearth.Started with a glass of Syrah, which was pretty good. I am not a wine connoisseur but I know if I like a wine and I liked the glass of syrah. For starters, had the charcuterie plate which I shared. All the cured meats were tasty and salty, not overwhelmingly so, but enough that you knew the salt was there. The duck liver pâté, was certainly my favorite item on the plate but the rabbit ballotine was a close second. The testa was ok, as was the duck rillettes, and wild boar cacciatorini. The toasted bread that came with the plate was great.For dinner I had the lasagna special made with spinach pasta, and I also tried the roasted duck breast and braised veal breast. The lasagna was al dente and the bechamel sauce was good. The duck breast was cooked perfectly at medium rare and the veal breast was tender. Of the three, I liked the lasagna the best.For dessert, we tried the apple cider doughnuts with apple compote and maple whipped cream, the yogurt panna cotta with kumquat sorbet and the vanilla bean budino with poached cherries. The doughnuts were great, but I didn't like the taste of the panna cotta. The kumquat sorbet was a little too sour for my taste.The decor is great, with the walls being adorned with a faux brick covering and the lighting dark enough to feel comfortable but not too dark that you can't see the people you are dining with.

3.0,2/26/2010,"This review is for Hearth Red Sauce Sundays, which I went to with my boyfriend this past Sunday.I love Italian food, especially the simple dishes like spaghetti & meatballs and lasagna, and this department, Hearth did not disappoint. We ordered one of each, and they were solid. My spaghetti portion was so big that I ate half of it the next day, but the lasagna portion was much smaller. So order the spaghetti if you're hungry. Our escarole soup and beef carpaccio appetizers were unmemorable, but the tiramisu and panna cotta were both very good. However, I couldn't help but feel our meal was overpriced at $39/person. My main gripe with this place is that the head chef started screaming (and I mean, literally screaming) at one of his waiters as we were finishing our meal, and it was really awkward given that we were sitting in the side room by the kitchen and could hear every word he was saying. It went something like: ""What the f*ck does this ticket mean? This means nothing to me. I invite my friends over to enjoy a meal and you can't even get the f*cking order rights. Now two people are not going to eat for the next 7 minutes because you f*cked up""....along those lines for a good 5 minutes. Those poor waiters looked honestly frightened as they wordlessly took the verbal beating, their heads hung low like bad puppies. I understand the chef being upset, but it was definitely an overreaction, especially with paying customers overhearing every word he was saying... huge turn off, and I don't think I'll be back.

5.0,2/17/2010,"My first trip to Hearth was drinks at the bar with some of my favorite Yelpers. They sure knew how to make a Martini and I was sold. Stealing a bite of gnocchi only left me wanting more. Finding out that they had apple cider donuts on the dessert menu sealed the deal for a return trip.So it was with delight that I found myself sitting here again this past weekend and I certainly made the most of it. The charcuterie plate for two basically contained a whole barnyard and the 12 year old idealistic vegetarian that still lives somewhere inside of me cringes a little at that thought. Luckily the 26 year old meat lover I've morphed in to was far too busy moaning over pate and lardo to notice. Is there anything sexier then just eating a ton of really decadent meat? (OK, maybe that's just me.)Sea bass with calamari and cockles followed for me, and the fish was skin on, and the skin was cooked in such a way that it was basically seafood bacon. mind=blown. I paired my meal with a perfectly cold Hendricks Martini. It's basically what I drink when I want to feel like a grown up. If you order it here, they'll pour it from the shaker with just a little hint of ice chips floating in it. Could I ask for anything more? Well, if you could, there's wine, and cider, and beer, oh my!After all this we could barely handle the donuts for dessert, but it being the driving force for our visit, we ordered anyway.

5.0,1/31/2010,"Our FAVORITE restaurant.  This is the place that really taught us about pairing wine with food.  They realize that there's a little more to it than whites go with fish/chicken and reds go with steak.  They carry such unique wines that we've never seen anywhere else and they are so good at pairing them with the menu.  As if the food wasn't good enough already, pair it with the perfect wine and it's absolutely mind blowing.  Each time we've been to Hearth (twice), they've been able to pair with wine with the food so well that you absolutely HAVE to have a sip of wine for each bite of food.  But they are not just pairing the wine with what they think is good; they also take your likes and dislikes into the factor and make individual suggestions.The staff is also very educated.  We loved talking to our waiter/waitress both times to learn more about wine, food, and their journey leading them to Hearth.  We were very impressed that our waiter even emailed us three months later to let us know that he came to San Francisco (our home town) and had a great meal.  He suggested that we try the restaurant.Food suggestions:  Everything is amazing, so you really can't go wrong, but we especially loved the veal ricotta meatballs with stuffed pasta and the doughnuts are an absolute MUST.  They are like heaven in your mouth.We can't wait to go back and sit at the bar with the open kitchen!  We had to by the ""Salt to Taste"" cookbook so that we can enjoy a little of Hearth while in California.",1,0,0,Ben R.,"San Ramon, CA",29,26,10

3.0,1/23/2010,"THE +'s:- Refined rustic food: NYC fine dining restaurants are branching out beyond the small portioned, ""vertical food"" that once was synonymous with high-end dining, and ""refined rustic"" is one of my favorites.  Hearth avoids subtle flavors, instead producing dishes that layer bold ones like the piney, smokey charred flavor of rosemary, the earthy richness of truffel and pumpkin, and salt (yes, when used correctly, salt is an amazing addition to a flavor profile).  And while I wouldn't use the word ""generous"" to describe the portions, they certainly aren't dainty.- Cucina Povera: Their $35 tasting menu allows guests to be treated to a cohesive meal (not that diners couldn't put one together themselves, but it's nice to not have to think about whether your appetizer will be too overpowering to be followed by your entree), and the $15 wine pairing ensures a harmonious match between food and drink, all without breaking the bank.- Drinks list: Hearth clearly put significant thought into it's drinks menu.  Like most other restaurants, it has the typical wine, beer and spirits sections, but take a moment to look at each, and you'll find innovative cocktails, micro brewed beers, and a diverse array of wines that will surely match any palate, even those looking for the very non traditional.- Not pretentious: The waiters dressed in flannel shirts and jeans should tip you off to the fact that this restaurant cares more about fostering a relaxing atmosphere than traditional fine-dining etiquette prescribes. HOWEVER, this is where we begin to transition into the minus category...THE -'s- Don't trust your waiter: Considering the overall price of a meal at Hearth, one might expect a more refined wait staff.  However, ours bordered on pushy (more on this below).  Of course he recommended the full winter tasting menu, which, while quite good, didn't seem to show the breadth of Heath's cuisine and could have been easily matched (or even outdone) with an appetizer, entree and dessert off the ala carte menu (for far less, too).  But, the stand-out problem came when he asked (or more insisted) if he could arrange the wine pairings for us over the course of the meal.  Huge wine paux pas were made, legitimately terrible wines were served, and I went to far as to ask him to stop my pairing (he wanted to serve a white wine with my steak, really?).- Competitors: In the rustic refined food arena, Hearth is not a stand out.  While the chef does produce a solid product, there is a bit of disconnect between some dishes.  At times, the food was (as previously explained) all about the flavor, and the presentation was almost an after thought.  However, other dishes seemed to have been pulled straight from the food tower-building, white-linened, snooty restaurants we went to Hearth to avoid!  If more effort was put toward the former, Hearth might reach the front of the pack.- Dessert: I'll keep this one short.  No.  ""But they have a new pastry chef,"" They should fire her.  ""But I have a sweet tooth,"" Go somewhere else. My recommendation:Hearth would make a great after work spot for some drinks and dinner.  If you're really at a loss for what to choose, by all means ask the waiters.  But I would instead just go and experiment on my own with the ala carte items, bring good company, and make an evening out of it.  I'm going to follow my own advice (at some point in the somewhat near future) and re-review Hearth.",1,0,1,Jonah P.,"Richmond, VA",45,405,6

While we waited, we had a drink at the bar (which they later took off the bill, not necessary, but was nice). They have a great beer selection- a lot of local craft beers. I love their dining room! It's not overly crowded and we weren't sitting right on top of other diners which is kind of a luxury in NY. I also saw that they have bar-type seating in their open kitchen... I wouldn't mind sitting in there, seems cool.Blahblahblah... can we just talk about food? My guy and I are calling our dinner at Hearth the best meal we've had in the city so far. Everything from start to finish was yummy. We shared the Poached Duck Egg w/ Frisee and the White Anchovy and Arugula salad to start. Both were excellent. I could have eaten another portion of the Duck Egg and been happy. For entrees I had the Veal & Ricotta Meatballs -- which I thought could have used a little more sauce, but other than that minor detail, were absolutely delicious. My guy had the Veal Breast with sweetbreads. I think he added that dish to his ""last meal"" list. The sweetbreads were heavenly. We also shared a side of gnocchi that were so simply done in a bit of butter, sugar and black pepper... which made for some delicious gnocchi. The gnocchi were perfectly doughy and just barely together like they should be.For dessert, we shared the apple cider donuts... again... perfect.I really can't say anything else besides perfect. We both left happy and I've been talking about my meal all day long. Try it!",0,0,1,Raven F.,"Brooklyn, NY",54,111,21
4.0,1/5/2010,"I had been wanting to go to Hearth for awhile and finally got the chance when my friend's dad took us out. Yayy free meals!I really wanted to go with the $70 five-course prix-fixe, but felt like I'd be crossing the line since I was a guest, but it did contain Venison which I love like Bambi's mother loves her child. Next time... I also contemplated getting the $30 three-course prix-fixe which included a very cheesy Riboletta soup (my friends got this and it was AMAZING), and a rabbit entree, also good.  I ended up getting the hamachi, which didn't seem to fit the country cooking palate of the rest of the menu, but was what I was hankering for. It was really great. I had the loin of lamb for my entree which was good, but not the best I've ever had.  A little on the dry side, but the brusell sprouts, sauce and all the accoutrement really brought it together. my friend got the meatballs which were out of this world, but i thought would've become monotonous for a whole meal.we shared the double chocolate ice cream sandwich, and although i'm not a big mint fan, really liked and found refreshing. we also got the sorbet sampler which included a huckleberry flavor that was to die for. my friend's dad kept the wines coming, and either he had a good taste for what was good or our server was just on it, either way, they rocked and the server was always attentive and helpful. glad i finally made it here.",1,0,1,Alex S.,"Brooklyn, NY",140,184,26

With the cosy brick, the soft lighting and the easy-going atmosphere, it led to effortless conversation and time passed without any real notion of it passing.

4.0,12/16/2009,"I came upon Hearth in my search for a place for my mother's birthday that would be able to accommodate my brother's gluten intolerance. I called ahead of time to make sure they were prepared for such diners. Once I arrived, (45 minutes before we sat down), I asked the hostess to make sure there would be a list of acceptable menu items for my brother's perusal. Despite these precautions, our waitress had not been informed of his needs and just handed him the full menu without any indications of problematic ingredients. She was happy to check with kitchen, but I'm going to take one star off because they sort of dropped the ball. It worked out in the end, but my brother was clearly very uncomfortable initially, and that could have been easily avoided. I also felt like they ruined a perfectly nice looking restaurant with all the red fabric squares mounted on the wall. The layout of the dining room here is strange to begin with, and they haven't done themselves any favors with that hideous back wall. Other than those two minor issues, Hearth is a hit.My dad and mom had spent the afternoon at a wine tasting class at New York Vintners, so Dad was quite happy to chat up the bartender and sommelier for recommendations to go with our meal. I'm not too knowledgeable on the subject, but Hearth seems to have an excellent wine list. When we arrived, the sommelier was busy sampling all the new selections that had arrived over the weekend, and he told us that there are always new wines to try. So, if you're into wine, definitely keep Hearth in mind. As for the food, there were so many things on the menu that I wanted to eat. As I was out with the family, I tried to get everyone to order something that I wanted to try, and I came pretty close to succeeding! Sadly, I wasn't able to sample their slow poached duck egg and confit leg with frisee, shallots and brioche, or their grilled calamari, but I will simply have to go back. On this occasion, I opted to get their $35 three course cucina povera. The winter menu consists of ribollita, rabbit, and a salted butterscotch budino. They also started us all off with a lovely shooter of pea soup. If this is what they are calling ""humble cooking,"" let me tell you, I'd eat like an Italian peasant any day of the year. Ribollita, a thick, hearty stew made of bread, leafy greens and white beans, was one of my favorite dishes when I was in Florence. Hearth served theirs topped with large parmesan shavings and crispy buttery croutons. The taste was the same, but the texture was even better. The rabbit came with polenta and olives, and was very nice. I normally hate olives, but these had been cooked, so their potent flavor was less overpowering, and I was able to properly enjoy their briny earthiness. I did wish there was a little bit more polenta, as the rabbit and the olives were piled on top of it, so it got a bit lost with all the meat and sauce and juice. The budino was a serviceable pudding. Not especially remarkable, but a satisfyingly sweet ending to a delicious meal.Boyfriend and I did a bit of a juggling act with our orders, as I agreed to share my rabbit, if he agreed to get the veal ricotta meatballs. They were really really good. Can't complain too much about a giant, wonderfully seasoned, cheesey meatball with a generous heap of tomato sauce and tender ravioli. Mmm. He also started off with the plate of house-made charcuterie, which featured a duck pate, rabbit ballotine, pickled veggies, and mustard, as far as I can recall. If I'm forgetting a component, I still remember that this was excellent. He finished off with some fantastic apple cider donuts with maple ice cream. These were so crispy and had a wonderful cinnamon flavor. Very delicious.I also tried Mom's paper wrapped cartoccio escolar, which was incredibly moist and buttery. I'd heard great things about escolar, and about cooking food encased in paper, and this dish was a great introduction to both. My dad's initial skepticism almost scared my mom off from ordering it, but after one bite he was forced to admit that it was better than the fish dish that he ordered-- not that he offered to share it with anyone else. My parents also split a side of the chef's famed gnocchi, which were meltingly good, and almost mashed potato-like in their creamy goodness.My brother got the roasted duck breast with turnips and concord grapes. I blinked and he inhaled the turnips so that he could concentrate on the duck, but I tried the rest and it was great. You can't go wrong with duck, and this one had crispy skin and was cooked medium rare. Concord grapes have a very strong and distinct flavor, but they actually complemented the duck here. Very nice. The brother was very very happy. He also had a side of polenta, and we some how wound up with a side of sweet potatoes. These were good, but probably the least inspired of the offerings we sampled. Bottom-line: for lots of great Italian food, try Hearth! Just shy of 5 stars.",7,4,6,Sarah C.,"New York, NY",152,352,60

I came with a large group of 7, with 2 Wine-ies who came as strangers and left as gay lovers. Just kidding - but they way they were orgasming over the different wines, you would have thought so.

3.0,11/5/2009,"There are enough good reviews, so I figured why write another, but I just wanted to disagree with D.P. Maybe they did not like you or something. Went to Hearth on 11/3 for dinner. Party of 4. Cannot comment on the wine by the glass, but Paul (one of the owners) helped with the long list by the bottle. Why get a glass - two people should polish off one bottle anyway. Told him our likes and dislikes and he actually brought us something blind. We drank it rather quickly and turns out it was from Lebanon. Who knew? Reasonably priced and pretty darn good. Went with a more traditional Barolo afterward which was fairly standard. I did not get the tasting menu, but the folks who got it gave me some bites. The salad - agree - somewhat uninspired, though the pears were delicious. The pumpkin ravioli though was warm and the filling tasted like i was scooping it directly out of the pumpkin itself. Really enjoyed it. Delicious. The venison was perfectly cooked and not cold. Nice red, almost rare center, melted in your mouth. The apple dessert thing was good, but very sweet. I had the duck egg, a middle course of some of the best damn gnocchi around and the pork special - loin and belly. Pork was good, but the gnocchi was excellent. Also tried the Gorgonzola ice cream and the cider donuts. Gorgonzola ice cream is different, but good. basically tastes like cold creamy cheese.  I hope donuts on menus do not go by the wayside, because donuts, like bacon, can be eaten at every meal. if i have one complaint (and this is a big one for me and reason for only 3 stars) I think they gave me a cup of regular when i asked clearly for decaf at 11pm. was up all night thanks to that.... next time i want to sit in the kitchen.",0,1,0,Jeff S.,"New York, NY",3,27,0
2.0,11/4/2009,"I am a NYC fine dining regular and was excited to give Hearth a shot after numerous excellent reviews. Upon arrival, we were greeted by a pleasant hostess and a large, spare dining room with padded carpet strips on one wall. Hearth has a large, seemingly complicated wine list that is likely excellent by-the-bottle, but too highbrow if going by-the-glass. After plenty of consultation with our server, we opted for the autumn tasting menu with one substitution. The salad course was not remarkable, with light dressing reminiscent of Henri's Tas-tee on the pear and pecorino salad. Next came lukewarm pumpkin ravioli that was so sweet it made my teeth ache, like a too-rich dessert.  The next day I read a 2006 interview with Chef Canora, who noted the following:  ""The filling of the pumpkin tortelli that I serve at Hearth in the fall is made with Mostarda di Cremona, which is essentially a jar of radioactive-looking fruits, and store-bought amaretti cookies.""  Assuming he used the same filling here in 2009.  I certainly wish I would have seen that ahead of time.The main course of venison (again, lukewarm) was overcooked yet flavorful.  The server smartly and subtly tried to warn me off of it and I should have taken her advice. My wife substituted the duck, which was excellent and the best thing we ate that evening. The apple crisp dessert was very basic and very good.

4.0,10/20/2009,"Last night I had a dream.  I dream't that I was directing a movie called 'Babe 3 - Pig In the East Village', starring a baby suckling pig and Marco Canora co-starred as the gruff but lovable chef of Hearth.   The first scene panned over lush pastures as young piglets happily rooted around Bev Eggleston's farm, and grew up in an ethical free range environment.  Cue the sappy Danny Elfman score.The next scene is a little darker, wherein Babe faces sort of a prueba diabolica montage of mutilation and lots of fire.  A rousing Wagner libretto, O Fortuna! (Orff) or even White Zombie would be appropriate.The next cut involves a darkened, serene dining room in the East Village, where a group of diners is served a frisee salad - intensely infused with the aroma of gorgonzola and warm bacon dressing.  Delicious, and well portioned, but cloying and lacking an acid.  A perfectly executed terrine sits on the side, accompanied by pickled spring onions, beets and carrots.  The spike of acid from the veggies provides the needed brightness to the pork, and a bit of house made brown mustard rounds the flavors out.  Utterly superb.  Who needs music at this point?  Ok, howabout the Garden State soundtrack?  All restaurants are doing it nowadays.The following scene is predictable, though not as well done as viewers (diners) would expect.  Roast pieces of pork, too generously adorned with glistening fat and lovely skin.  The skin would have been better crispy, but a well done cassoulet and side of chard kept the scene in balance.  If Nicolas Cage was the (fatty) pork, then Sean Connery was the chard and cassoulet that saves his ass from mediocrity.  The epic nature of the pork fat layered with more pork and fat deserves a commensurate score, so maybe something from Howard Shore or John Williams.  Heaviness indeed.I should note that in the background, a legion of front-of-house staff are seamlessly filling water glasses, refilling bread, and doing a great job of making themselves known, while unnoticed at the same time.  Probably one of the better serviced restaurants in the East Village.And though this dream didn't involve a steamy scene with Jessica Alba, it was a pleasant one, and one that i'd enjoy having again.",5,8,7,Chris H.,Hong Kong,170,603,2140

4.0,10/13/2009,"I had long been wondering about Hearth. One Monday night, we decided to finally give it a try. Something about the cold starting to set in and the overcast weather made us want a comforting and hearty meal: Hearth delivered on both. First, we ordered drinks from the extensive and inventive wine and spirits list. I was in the mood for something warming and in the Scotch realm. Our server suggested I try a drink with some smoky mescal, maple syrup, and vermouth. I forget what the drink was called (SORRY!), but it was delicious and well worth it. My boyfriend ordered a whiskey drink that was equally tasty. I'd like to go back and try some more of the cocktails. We decided that we weren't hungry enough, so we skipped the appetizers. Again, I'd be delighted to go back and try them - we would have ordered nearly every one, if we had the stomach space.  For entrees we ordered the branzino, with chickpea and some sort of kale-like green. The skin on the fish was PERFECTLY crispy and salty. It was laid on a chickpea puree, then topped with some crispy greens. The textures were perfect, and to add to everything, they topped it with the fried chickpea skins - delicious crunchy, salty bites to complement the food. My boyfriend ordered roast lamb that was served with breckle (a roasted and crispy serving of brisket meat/fat that melted like butter in your mouth). The lamb was perfectly cooked medium rare. Rosemary garnished the dish and was used wonderfully, and in the exact right proportions. We split Hen of the Woods mushrooms on the side were awesome, if not a little salty. Our server suggested a wine pairing for each, and the wine was fantastic! I believe I got a languedoc - it was light and buttery and went really well with the fish. We finished it off with what has become my newest favorite dessert (I have like, one a week): peanut butter pie. It was comprised of layers of peanut butter filling and rich chocolate!

My wife's pork entree was a bit of a dicotomy....the pork itself was a bit dry and begging for a sauce however the pork belly that accompanied it was flavorful and succulent. My veal entree was good but a bit fatty. A significant note overall was that all four of the entrees our table ordered were clearly lacking so far as portion size. I would guess that the protein weight of each of our four entrees was 3 ozs at most. The vibe of the place is very nice and the owner/chef seems to be a cool guy.

My date had some fish that was also very good, and my only complaint is that the gnocchi I got for a side was not al-dente (i.e. too soft).

5.0,8/6/2009,"The Discovery of Hearth is all by coincidence, it has very little to do with even a mild intent to enter the establishment.  Having more than 45 minutes to render prior to meeting Rachel at Luzzo's, the captivating awnings with a vivid shade of red caught my attention.That was my first introduction to Hearth, I have returned on more than 10 occasions.Why might you ask?It starts with one individual...  Hearth's resident mixologist, Ms. Kelley Slagle!The drinks:  Having gone to Hearth on countless occasions, the decision is always to sit at the bar and render myself to the perfectly concocted beverages made my Kelley.  During my first venture, my typical Vespar Martini (consisting of 3 oz. Beefeaters, 1 oz. Ketel One, 0.5 Oz Lillet Blanc, Shaken, and Served with a Lemon Twist) was executed with precision.  The smooth and refreshing taste derived from the Lillet and Lemon Wedge worked to balance out the Beefeater and Ketel One.  What's most impressive about Kelley's immaculate ability to develop such a beverage is her understanding of both ingredients and balance.  During another encounter, Kelley was dealt the task creating a drink of her choosing.  Having already established a relationship (with her knowledge for my preference of Gin), I was presented with an Aviation (consisting of 1.25 oz.

4.0,6/28/2009,"The dressier older sister to Terroir, Hearth is a charming restaurant with a glowing ambience that lives up to its quiet emberous name.  I met a friend for a leisurely Sunday dinner and had a lovely time.An amuse bouche of warm fava bean soup was a nice, appropriate choice for a rainy evening, and I drained my little glass in a couple long measured swallows.We decided on the cucina povera menu, a three-course dinner for $35, with wine pairing for another $15.  The first course was an escarole salad with walnuts and pecorino, a standard salad, but nice with good cheese.  The main was a grilled flat iron steak with market greens and cannellini beans.  The steak was cooked a pretty medium rare, and it was tasty if nothing special.  The best course was the dessert, a pistachio budino with creme fraiche and sour cherries and sour cherry sauce.  It was rich and creamy but with a touch of salt and a little bit of tang from the creme fraiche and cherries.  The pistachio flavor came through in a big way, and the cherries were wilted down soft and delicious.The wine pairing turned out to be something of a steal.  I thought each course would come with a little splash of wine, but $15 bought three full glasses.  The first was a light fruity white poured from a box.  I'd never seen box wine at a restaurant, but our server assured us of its quality, and I have to say, I really enjoyed it.  The second was a syrupy thick syrah that was very good with the steak, if a bit much to handle on its own.  With dessert we got a powerful bit of port that tasted a bit sharply alcoholic but that I gulped down nonetheless.  I was fairly tipsy by the end of this meal.  Bravo.The service was great - our waitress was friendly, engaging, and enthusiastic, eager to answer questions.  While the food was nothing mind-blowing, it was good overall, and the wine was swell and plentiful.  In the end, I might prefer Terroir, but Hearth is different and I enjoyed my meal.  I would definitely recommend it for a nice dinner out in the village.",3,2,4,Steph C.,"Los Angeles, CA",3889,3534,94

5.0,5/3/2009,"I've lived in the East Village for as long as I've lived in New York. And I've lived one block from Hearth just as long too, because at one point I lived on 11th Street between 1st Avenue and Avenue A, then on 13th Street and 1st Ave, and before my most current location of St. Marks and 1st Avenue, I lived on 2nd Avenue and 12th Street. Guess it's all in the timing! I ventured over to Hearth with my boyfriend to celebrate my birthday because we didn't want to travel out of the East Village. And it was definitely a great decision. Guess good things come to those who wait.Because of the rain, and the fact that it was a Friday, we weren't having much luck when we called a few other hopeful destinations on our short list of restaurants to explore in the East Village. When we called Hearth, they told us there were no available seats in the dining room until 9:30 pm, and they told us there were seats in the kitchen. So we ran out the door and up the street to Hearth. The seats in the kitchen sounded curious, and when we walked in, we immediately saw the seats and told them we'd take two! What a great experience to literally be where all the action of the restaurant takes place, from the servers running around to the cook and kitchen staff preparing an endless array of meals.We had a few Maker's Mark Manhattans with our First Course; I had the grilled quail with farro salad, tomato preserves and a poached quail egg, while my boyfriend enjoyed their Summer Salad made up of radish, haricots vert, tomato and a red wine vinaigrette. And for our Main Courses we opted for decadence. I mean, it was a meal that was a part of my birthday weekend, right? So I had the roasted duck breast with duck leg confit, peaches, turnips and foie gras. I'm salivating just writing about our meal.The prices are a little over-priced, but for the quality of service and food that included two courses, and a great time in the kitchen, not to mention the two perfect glasses of wine we had paired with each of our meals and a few cocktails, $200 is not horrible. We're going back, and the next time we're going to get the four-course tasting menu!If you decide to go, steer clear from wearing plaid or striped button-down shirts, because otherwise you will blend with the staff, as that is their quirky yet friendly uniform.",3,0,1,Wilson A.,"New York, NY",22,39,1

3.0,4/10/2009,"BEST SORBET! STEWY COMFORT FOOD is how I describe this place. Great for the Winter months but alas, it is not Winter any longer. Fava Beans were seasonal so they made a 5 course Tasting Menu ($82) out of it. I like the fact that they change up the ingredients according to what's farm fresh. Another example would be the Sorbet sampler. It used to be cranberry, quince and pineapple. I knew that the sister resty was Insieme, which also has a $35 prix fixe, but was made aware by Rey Rey that this place has the same owner as a 3rd place, Terroir, a wine bar down the street. Some of us ordered the Cucina Povera, which literally translates into 'humble cooking'. They boast that this means 'exceptionally tasty food'. They are not off the mark with that, but I wanted to see some grill marks somewhere. 3.5 stars, rounded down to 3 because I'm indifferent about going back, except for the killer sorbets!Amuse (free) - fava bean soup shot - thick, tastyOrdered:CUCINA POVERA ($35/3 courses)-Escarole Salad (w/ walnuts, red onion and aged pecorino) - as embellished as could be for salad, forced my fiber/green intake for the day, as I would never typically order salad -Braised Goat (w/ rapini, cannellini beans and gremolata) - reminded me of a short rib, as it was 'stringy', huge portion, rappini is broccoli raab, gremolata is chopped garlic, parsley, lemon zest, definitely tasted the zest in this, super savory but thank goodness for the sauce or else it would've been too try-Hazelnut Budino (w/ whipped cream and candied hazelnuts) - not crazy about the pudding, as it tasted like all cream with subtle flavor, the candied hazelnuts were awesome though, I definitely thought they skimped hereAlso tried:-Frog Legs ($15) - this was super tender fall of the bone delicious, tiny bones though, french sized portions-Sorbet Sampler ($10) [blood orange, kiwi, rhubarb] - 3 HUGE SCOOPS of the BEST sorbet I've had anywhere, definitely homemade, blood orange (maroon) was MIND BLOWING - think of eating a blood orange sans the meat popping in your mouth, sans any hint of bitterness in the skin, and that's how it tastes, except a tad sweeter, the kiwi (light green) was bursting with flavor as well, with seeds in tow, color was true to the fruit, the rhubarb (pink/magenta) was very good as well, super earthy, these sorbets blows those stores out of the water, put it this way: Hearth is to sorbet what Otto Enoteca is to Gelato, except the food is better here, must get, CRACKTACULAR!Total came out to $45 after everything",6,3,4,Jeff C.,"New York, NY",1152,1258,14

I thought it would be a little bit of a younger crowd, but hey that's splitting hairs. I am down with middle aged people!my friend and I shared the snapper crudo and arugula & fennel salad as appetizers... the salad was pretty good (although slightly soggy?) but the crudo was gross! the fish had a dry-ish look do it, as though it had been sitting out for a while and just did not taste fresh. the flavor of the rosemary was also overwhelming... I could get better raw fish in a cut-rate sushi joint. not tasty.on to the entrees! I had the much pooh-pooh'd veal breast. it was only ok... there was a nice layer of fat around the outside (love fat!) but the meat was slightly dry. the best part of the dish was the sweetbreads, and they were not THAT exciting. now for the kicker: my friend had the striped bass, and as he cut into it, he goes ""damn, this is kind of tough..."" tough fish?! we look at the dish and the bass is RAW on the inside - whoever made it didn't even barely cook it, there was like a 1/2 cm ring around the outside that was cooked but otherwise it was raw. unsanitary and disgusting!!the waitress was pretty cool about it, comped us dessert... but for some reason they still charged us for the raw, uneaten bass. we didn't bother complaning and getting it removed... she was so frazzled already that when she brought the bill she forgot to bring the part to sign... we were just like, forget it.the only reason I gave this restaurant 2 instead of 1 stars is that the wine recommended to us was very good and because the salad and veal breast were not horrible.

5.0,2/23/2009,"I don't typically give out 5 stars, and truth be told, I hesitated to do so here - but when I started to remember the food, I realized I could not be stingy.The negative first: Why did I hover over 4 stars?  The decor is just fine, but I typically feel a five-star restaurant will have something special about the interior.  Here, I felt nothing.  Perhaps I'd have had a different experience if we were able to get in on the actual dining room, but when we called for a reservation at about 5pm that Sat, every table was booked and we were left to chance as to whether we'd find a spot at the bar.  Rather than have to sit at the bar, there are two small tables that you can snag across from the bar, and we were just lucky enough to get one of them.I guess that makes it a 5-star situation, since you can still hope to steal a chance to dine at Hearth in spite of its extreme popularity any given night!The other minor thing that made me want to almost give Hearth a 4 - the music situation was odd.  I noticed a random variety of pop going on in the background at any given time - especially when a song came on after what was perfectly fine music-less silence (and the gentle hum of diners talking). But onto the good -- THE FOOD!!! I went with, yes, FD, and we both got the seasonal tasting ($76 for 5 courses, subject to change each day).  The house was kind enough to offer a warm turnip soup to warm us up, and it was rich and somewhat sweet.  The tasting began with a fabulous poached lobster with lobster tortellini - this was by far my favorite dish - what a way to start.  The lobster was tender and cooked to perfection, while the tortellini was like nothing I've ever put in my mouth!! The pasta was thin and delicate, not unlike a wonton skin, and the filling was heavenly.Next was a pork sausage with another pasta I cannot recall the name of (long and flat).  Again, the pasta was very delicate, obviously made fresh daily, and allowed you to really enjoy the sauteed sausage and broccoli rabe. No heavy creams or sauces, just a purity of flavor.We followed with the main course - ribeye of beef with short ribs, beets and marrow.  The pieces of ribeye were absolutely perfect, and the minced beets a great companion (although perhaps would have been better in bigger slices).  Of course, who can say anything bad about marrow... but the short ribs seemed a bit much. I'd honestly have left this off the dish, as it was just seriously overloading it.Finally - two, yes TWO desserts! First an orange parfait with candied pistachios.  Great texture and tartness, a nice way to cleanse the palate and ready you for the passionfruit souffle with chocolate sauce.  I loved the lightness of this souffle - as they tend to be overly chocolate and heavy, and that the flavor was passionfruit was definitely rather unique.  FD believed he had never had such a wondrous dessert in all his life (and he's lived much of it in France).We paired this meal with a fabulous bottle of I don't know what (FD picked it out with the help of a very knowledgeable sommelier), and it was served at the perfect temperature.  I have to say, I always love a good sommelier.Service was really good -- each dish was introduced, plates cleared timely, wine and water refilled aptly.  We never felt rushed, and was permitted to enjoy our food and have a serious conversation (I felt a bit sorry for the staff, as I could tell they were trying to not interrupt our talk, while providing excellent service).So yeah - a rare five-star review from Joan H!

Some people will think the food is REALLY great, if they like creative combinations of ingredients that still manage to taste homey and reassuring. Striped bass with pomegranate seeds, or butternut squash soup with a fish garnish are some of the more unexpected combos. The wine list is extensive and full of surprisingly good options. Their starter soups are unusual (and, to be fair, sometimes hit or miss). And it's too bad they no longer offer the smoked-lemon cocktail that they once had on their menu.There are lots of thoughtful decorative details, like a graphic designer's early versions of their logo by the entrance to the bathroom (a nice humorous self-aware move) or cookbooks actually on the ledge of the restroom.The stand-out aspect of Hearth was the service.

The restaurant was incredibly inviting on such a cold, chaotic night. The restaurant was dimly lit and covered in warm colors (as you'd expect with a name like Hearth).We were served a warm amuse-bouche soon after sitting - a nice start to a cold new year. And we all enjoyed the tasting menu for the night, which included ingredients like scallops, spare ribs, steak, foie gras, and caviar. Everything, down to the amazing fluffy souffle/chocolate dessert, was delicious. Though being a foie gras lover myself (I choose to think that it grows from trees), I would've preferred it not being chopped up into bits and cooked inside a ravioli (give me a big chunk, slightly seared please!). The ravioli was good, but a bit too salty for my taste.Given how annoying a night New Years Eve in NYC can be, I was amazed by how gracious the service was. From the hostesses who remained jovial despite being exhausted and on their feet for many hours, to the servers who timed and orchestrated the tasting menu well across the packed restaurant.So why not give Hearth a ""Yay! I'm a fan."" rating? Well, their wine list is priced way too high for a restaurant of its stature and location (east village). C'mon, even at ""a nice place"" in the e. village, you should be able to order bottles cheaper than $50.

Service: Our reservation was for 10:45/11pm, but we got seated closer to 11:15. The hostess and sommelier were friendly; our main waitress, not so much -- I don't think she cracked a smile all night. They also unfortunately opened the door (or let someone hold it open for a while) and the restaurant became FREEZING for a sustained period toward the end of our meal (remember how cold it was that night?). Not cool. Food: They were out of our first choice of wine and a few of the items on the regular menu, but we all ordered the NYE prix fixe tasting menu. They had to sub in the sorbet course because I guess they ran out of the dark chocolate passion fruit -- that said, what they substituted in was delicious. The food in general was great -- a delicious scallop/short rib course, a great beef entree, a nice parsnip soup amuse bouche. The main dessert -- coconut souffle with chocolate sauce -- was superb. My one food issue was with the soup course -- there was a kind of fish ceviche with paddlefish caviar on top, served in the middle of a bowl of butternut squash soup. Both on their own were good, but the cold fish section didn't pair well with the hot soup around it, and it wasn't something I would have wanted to mix together.",1,1,1,Pamela S.,"New York, NY",906,1220,115
5.0,12/22/2008,"A lovely friend was moving back to London, so what better way to fête then some upscale American!Compared to the slushy, withered hell-hole that is NYC after a snowstorm, Hearth did indeed provide warm comfort.  I slowly removed my deerskins, untied my leather galoshes, and after a swig of Mead offered by the heavily-moustachio'd bartender was on my way to la table.NOTTTTTbut it did feel good to get out of the cold.Anyways, us all being poor now, my friend and I decided to put this upscale (but below top tier in price) to the test, seeing if we could get a meal's worth out of just drinks, entrees, and a split dessert.  The answer, surprisingly, was yes.The menu is a single slip with appetizers, a tasting menu (looks amazing, want to try it), and entrees.  Methinks tis divided by meat, fish, and pasta.We were first met with a shotglass full of warm fennel soup.  It tasted righteous, though getting it all down became a bit odd, unless you're used to taking shotz of a slow moving, viscous white liquid ;)))))))Our waitress was also very friendly, and even when clueless about wines had the brainz to call over the sommelier, who is also a cool bro.  The wine list at hearth is pretty epic, with a great selecsh of bottles under $40 and a great selecsh over $250.  Huh.We got an awesome côtes du rousillon for $32 and I was more than happy.  I'm telling you, bang for buck, Languedoc and Provence will smoke anyone.The list itself  is a mage's scroll filled with lists of varying types, origin, and prices, heaped with anecdotes in a fine calligraphy penned by a wino master.  Lots of interesting bottles.  I would read this to my children.  Or to myself while in the bathroom.  Cool book.  Super long though.I went with the Bernanke bailout list (this is not a lie).With a wave of my hand a a twirl of my beard, I demanded the pumpkin tortelle with a nutty cream sauce.  This was amazing.  All the flavors in perfect harmony etc, but it was really the contrast between the insanely delicious pumpkin filling with the firm edge of the tortelle that had me on edge throughout the meal.  Crisp basil leaves were served as well.My partner in crime got a roast chicken with root vegetables that was succulent, tender, and well spiced, but honestly I don't think it highlighted the capabilities of the kitchen as well (but dont knock it, most chicken is shit in restaurants riiiight??)Dessert was an awesome buckwheat torte with vanilla ice cream.  Not savory, not sweet, sort of just great.  A nice, subtle dessert that kind of recapped the meal and made me happy to have dropped cash.The kids left with distended bellies and a bill of only $100.  Not bad for the quality of food (top notch) and level of service (actually good).  I'll be coming back to Hearth the next time I can afford it.",4,2,2,Jake A.,"Brooklyn, NY",21,44,0

Late apps (40 minutes) , an eye roll when we ordered something less than the most expensive wine on the menu? The dining room filled with burning oil from a malfunctioning boiler, and the response I got from the manager was ""It's not our fault"". Are you kidding me? So it's my fault for paying $500 for dinner for four? Apart from the expectations I had built up from the first three times I was there, I have been embarrassed for the last time. When the dinner tab is $40, I can accept less than stellar service. If you want to roll with the big boys, you have to have consistency. If 2 out of 5 times I have experienced major errors at this price range, and managers were unable to correct it,  all I can say is that this is a failure.",3,0,1,Jim C.,"New York, NY",30,87,3

4.0,9/17/2008,"Date Visited: August 28thPeople: Megan, Lisa, RyanMy tab: ~$70The food was solid, but not spectacular. What really makes me want to come back to this place was the service, which was fabulous, particularly for nyc standards. Only funny thing was that all the servers, including women, wore long sleeve plaid, collared shirts. Whoever called them Paul Bunyan look alikes was not that far off.I started out with the grilled octopus salad, which was was pretty tender and served with watermelon and olives...strange but it worked. My only problem with this dish was that I had something similar a A Di La 3 days earlier, and this restaurant cannot compete with that place. Megan had the quail and quail egg which was better. The quail itself was fine but the egg, which was supposed to be ""poached"", was probably a little overdone, I figured it would be at least a little runny, like at blue hill. Again, this place doesn't compare favorably to these studs. With this ryan picked out a fabulous french wine that was mostly grenache. I wanted fish, and found something that could hold it's own with the wine: a monkfish wrapped in prosciutto, with fig and fennel. not exactly the most delecate of dishes, but great. Megan had the veal with sweetbreads and a ton of those hen-of-the-woods mushrooms. It seemed like Ryan was satisfied with his duck w/ foie gras. All dishes are recommended, i don't have anything against this place, it's just that, as megan would say...it seems like the food lacks a little Love.

3.0,9/15/2008,Went here for an anniversary dinner a little while back and was completely underwhelmed by the experience. The ambiance and service were very good but the food was subpar. I had the scallops and while they were cooked alright they were not cleaned properly. Almost every bite had some sand in it. Whatever came with it was unmemorable. Also while they have quite an extensive wine list it did not have any affordable options. The few wines they had available by the glass were $15 and up.

The juxtaposition just tickles me. But it only works if the server wearing the 501s is helpful. Ours was casual and sweet, and very well-intentioned, but her wine pairing recommendations were flat out wrong. I HATE when servers don't care enough to give you correct information. I don't expect them to know everything (or even a lot!) but they can at least refer you to someone more knowledgable when they can't answer your question. Otherwise, you're just wasting money.RANT OVER.The food: the food was delicious and smart. I like that they change the menu depending on what they have fresh that day. I had the Sturgeon with fennel, figs, and prosciutto, and it was perfectly executed. Like so perfect it made me forget the $15/glass fruit cocktail I was drinking. Well, that is, until now.

What impressed me immediately was this restaurant has the greatest manifesto ever, and their take on service and hospitality is equal to what I'd expect from being hosted at a friends house. In person, they delivered on all counts.Beyond the service and atmosphere is the food. I have never had such an amazing food experience. Every bite, every morsel, sent shocks of glee and serenity to my brain. I know, I'm gushing, but seriously ... we had the New Zealand Snapper Crudo and Sea Scallops (off the tasting menu) for appetizer. I had the Roasted Wild Stripped Bass and my date had the Roasted Duck Breast. We also had the Gnochi (served in a white sauce) and the Hen of the Woods Mushroom sides. For dessert my date had the Chocolate-Peanut Butter Tart and I had two cheeses matched to my wine by our waitress. The Crudo and the Scallops were the highlight, that said, everything was delicious.Rely on your servers, ask questions, don't hesitate to ask for something off the tasting menu, if they can do it, they will. The servers will take excellent care of you and make great recommendations.Most importantly, read the wine list and descriptions, specifically for the Clos Saron. If the description doesn't make you want to go out and be a vintner, it will at least make you want to order the wine. It is, to date, the best wine I've ever tasted! We had the La Cuve Mystrieuse, the bottle was actually numbered. I think we had #730 out of  1,316. If you ask, they will remove the label and stick  to a piece of their letterhead for you. I had to have sip between every bite of food it was that good.I definitely plan on returning to little gem, and an plan to sit and fest at the bar, for a more casual experience!Update: Since I have sat at the bar for a drink. I ordered a dirty martini and it was so gross I thought the olive juice had gone bad. So the bartender made me a new one. The new one was just as difficult to drink.

The staff is friendly enough.  We sat in the back so got to walk past the kitchen-- very clean and theres a chef's table available which i always find interesting. The menu is sort of nouveau tuscan.  Rustic, but simple and sophisticated presentation.  Quality ingredients.  But a closer look at the menu raises a red flag.  The only steak they offer is a rib eye?  Can't be good.  But ok, this isn't a steak house.  So whatevs.  When i ask the waitress what she recommends though, she starts to rave about the rib eye.  I'm tempted because it also has two words that will make me drool:  ""bone marrow"".  So ok, i order the ribeye.  I know this might be a mistake.  To start we have the artichoke and peekytoe crab salad.  I order a glass of white to match my crab.  The presentation is gorgeous.  The ingredients, gorgeous.  The taste is wonderful.  The portions for the peekytoe is fine for $16 but the artichoke salad is sort of a cruel joke.  Maybe 1/4 cup of salad.  For $16.  This place isn't THAT good (enough to justify that price, at least).  Halfway through my crab salad and 3 waiters later, i finally get my wine.  Its ok.  The waitress recommended it.  Our plates are cleared and we're ready for our entrees.  What seems like four hours later, we finally get them.  The rib eye.. doesn't look like rib eye.  Its beautiful but the portions do look kinda small again (two small pieces of rib eye, 1 small piece of braised short rib and dots of delicious bone marrow).  A few bites in and i realize the portion is ok.  I'm getting full.  The rib eye is rib eye.  Its not very tender, too fatty at some points and dry tasting in other points.  Its not as good as the waitress makes out.  The bone marrow is delicious (how can bone marrow NOT be delicious?) and so is the short rib.  It also came with a vegetable i have never heard of nor tasted: pickled crone.  (mmm yum pickled crone).  I can't even find a picture of it on the internet.  Not even wikipedia!We finish our entrees and what seems like another FOUR HOURS pass by until someone finally stops by to pick up our plates.  Have you noticed yet that the service here kinda sucks?  The desert menu looks uninspired.  Enough for us to skip it.  A restaurant that charges $36/entree $16/starts should be memorable and spectacular.  Hearth is neither.  Don't get me wrong-- its good-- but it doesn't live up to its prices.  What really gets me is the service.  For the price, the service should at least be impeccable.  Its not.  And with a million other dinner options in the city, this place doesn't give me a reason to come back.EDIT:  here they are!  C-r-o-S-n-e.  gourmetsleuth.com/crosne…",5,0,4,Cassandra O.,"Santa Monica, CA",42,54,0

The monkfish was excellent - cooked perfectly, soft, lightly seasoned, and simply presented. The loin of lamb was nice- medium-done, it was juicy, with all of the natural flavors well represented. The vegetables on the plate were not so good, a little undercooked and dry, but did not take away from the lamb. The potato puree side is fantastic - so smooth, perfectly buttered, rich and creamy - a definite yes.

3.0,7/24/2007,"So I'm going to rate this on a tougher scale than usual because the place seems like it's trying to be in a higher league.Food: it was good, but the portions were tiny and very expensive.  I actually just had the beet salad, which was good (the gorgonzola was delicious!).  My friends' meals were also tiny... one was surprised to get a raviolo, which we figured must be the singular of ravioli since there was definitely only one thing on her plate.Service: What's up with the pieces of bread being placed on your plate one at a time?  I don't know if that's supposed to enhance the experience or freshness, but I found it rather intrusive.  Plus, despite the waiter's invitation to ""take our time"" I felt at each stage of the meal that we were being hurried.  Maybe we were a bit slow, but they should be perceptive enough not to mistakenly take the bill when we haven't even opened it yet.",0,0,0,David X.,"New York, NY",10,121,0
4.0,5/23/2007,"Wait staff and bartender were knowledgeable, nice and actually acted like they wanted to be there - and wanted you there.  Such a departure from most NY places.It's a ""grown up"" place -- kind of reminded me of a place you'd take your parents when they came to visit you at college.  The food was good, if not life-altering.",0,0,2,Meryl C.,"Brooklyn, NY",393,408,23
4.0,5/17/2007,"I will say that our waiter at Hearth was quite possibly the nicest, most polite waiter I've ever encountered.  Being from Chicago, I was even more surprised to encounter him on the lower East Side of New York.  The food was definitely above average in taste, and price, but was thoroughly enjoyed by everyone in our group.  The Carmen Miranda was a little sweet for Melanie G.'s taste, and Farva beans made an appearance at every course - but other than that, there were no complaints.  I echo the ""casual"" vibe of this place.  Definitely a great place for a date.",2,0,1,Andy G.,"San Francisco, CA",404,203,3
4.0,5/16/2007,"Not much to add to the earlier reviews.  I love the intimate atmosphere and the cozy organization to the seating.  The food is eclectic and experimentive, but without being unsettling.  As an earlier reviewer mentioned, I think it definitely is a pretty good place to take a date.  Intimate enough for real conversation -- certainly quiet enough -- stimulating and different enough to spur conversation, and tasty enough and consistent enough to avoid potential embarassment (you _like_ this food?!) (archly!), diverse wine list -- with a good range of selections for any palate.",1,0,2,Ferdinand H.,"Baltimore, MD",1289,652,2
5.0,4/9/2007,"Hearth is great -- I'd say it offers the best combination of exquisite food and great service in the East Village. The ambience is comfortable and cozy -- refined but casual, in keeping with its East Village location. The menu veers away from the familiar, tried-and-true, but the chef's experiments rarely go awry, and the staff does a great job of keeping up with a menu that changes often to keep up with local, even obscure, offerings and menu items based on the latest from the farmer's market.  The full menu is available at the bar, should you (like me) occasionally wander by without a reservation. Our dinner was great, from the lentil soup to the fava bean salad to the gnocchi and the grapefruit cheesecake.  I should come here more often!",1,0,2,Anne C.,"New York, NY",34,101,0
4.0,1/22/2007,"Hearth is one of the few places where I would recommend to bring a date. Located at the heart of east village, Hearth offers great ambiance and is close enough to the bar scene so you can get your date nice and liquored up after the dinner (provided that you did not already splurge on a bottle of wine). The charm of Hearth is in its extensive wine list. I am by no means a master sommelier, the staff will be more than willing to walk you through their prolific collection and choose the right wine to accompany your taste. Do not be intimidated and do ask questions. When in doubt, ask if you may taste the choices that you've narrowed down. They will happily oblige.As for the menu, I would recommend the scallops for appetizer and the poached chicken for entree. I have not yet tried the tasting menu, but it will be a priority the next time I visit Hearth.Hearth earns 4 stars for its attentive and friendly staff and impressive wine list. So bring a date, bring your friends; heck, bring your mom. Hearth will definitely leave a lasting impression. One last word of caution: Although Hearth opens late, it is usually flowing with traffic. Do make the effort to obtain an reservation. I did run into trouble getting a table a few times during peak hours.",2,0,1,Steeeeeeeve H.,"New York, NY",18,34,0
4.0,10/9/2006,"I'd give Hearth four stars. The atmosphere is warm and cozy, the food is quite tasty, and the dessert is delicious! The only odd thing I found about the night was the way the waiters and waitresses interacted with me. They were very intense and in-your-face...to the point that I felt uncomfortable and I couldn't look away! They also would just pop out of nowhere...or swoop in. Eventually, it got so bad, I just started laughing. Anyway, it was very good. I ate the skate with autumn vegetables (yum), and the plum tart with lemon thyme ice cream. Next time, I want to try the steamed chocolate cake with earl grey whipped cream!",2,0,2,Charlene C.,"New York, NY",50,19,17
4.0,5/6/2006,"I ate there on a recent trip to NYC.  Coming from SF, my last trip to NYC, food-wise, I would say wasn't up to snuff.  (This is of course after a friend tried to sell me on some bruised fruit from Dean & Deluca, where the produce looked like it was beaten during the trip from California.)  But this place really changed my mind.  I started with the foie gras (since it's about to be come illegal in California).  Followed up with the skate.  Didn't order dessert, but the wait staff brought out lemon squares with our coffee.  Very nice, not too pretentious.  A good experience.",0,0,1,David S.,"San Francisco, CA",13,56,0
4.0,4/17/2006,"This is a great place to eat in the E Village. First of all the food was fantastic and plentiful. I split the duck papardelle and the meatball special and I couldn't have been happier. The food was tasty, flavorful and came out in good size portions. And to top it off, dessert was excellent and the bill was reasonable. I liked the atmosphere although I found the outfits of the waitstaff a bit strange. The service was not bad but a bit sloppy. Overall, I liked this place and would go back again. I actually didn't think I would like it as much as I did!",2,0,1,Jen L.,"New York, NY",183,268,0
3.0,3/11/2005,"This cozy, causal restaurant is localed in the East Village. Nice atmosphere for a causal date, however, I went there with a friend.  I started off my dinner with scallops wrapped in bacon. I was expecting big, succulent scallops, but it turned out to be tiny baby scallops. I did a get a bunch of them though.  For my entree, I had the lamb prepared three ways. It came with three pieces of lamb loin, one braised rib, and lamb sausage. I enjoyed the braised rib the best, however, there was way too much fat on it. Once I removed the fat, there was only one bit left of the meat. I wish I had more. The loin was delicious. The lamb sausage was really unique. I looked like lamb tartarte. It was pretty good.   We also ordered a side order of creamy polenta and hen of the woods mushrooms. The polenta was too creamy and rich, but the mushrooms were perfect.  For dessert, I had the pear and hazelnut crisp with cranberry sorbet. It was delicious! The crunchy hazelnut and oats really was a great combination. It was served warm. I also ordered a side of peanut butter brittle ice cream. I had to just to order it since it sounded so unique. The ice cream was really tasty with tiny bits of candy.   Overall, I thought the food was good. I don't think I would go back though.",1,0,0,Denise L.,"San Francisco, CA",122,442,0
