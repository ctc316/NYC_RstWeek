5.0,4/11/2019,"These Feb 1, 2019 was my first time at Mifune and April 6, 2019 was my second time at Mifune. Both were for different occasions but the experience was ever mind blowing and I ABSOLUTELY LOVE LOVE LOVE MIFUNE (Bottom posts are from my Instagram account- if u wanna check it out~~~ @therealhappiimonkii )Feb. 1, 2019So blessed to have been able to start February off by going to restaurant week and catching up with the dearie  haven't seen her since New Year's Eve/day. ..It was a cold night but a great night. Nothing like spending time and hanging out with friends u love ..The duck leg with poached egg. The egg was cooked to perfection and the duck was great. Tasted like spam. Would have loved a slice of toasted bread to go with it...Next was the main course, which I got the nigiri!!!! My faves were the tuna, scallop and squid!!!! The scallop absolutely melted in my mouth and disappeared, while the squid was chewy and soft and so tender!!!!! ..Then ended the meal off with hojicha creme brûlée. It wasn't too sweet and I loved the crunchy brûlée top.#happiimonkii #happii #monkii #live #love #laugh #smile #nyc #nyclife #restaurantweek #mifune #nigiri #cremebrulee #japanese #catchup #drinks #latenightsApril 6, 2019Came back to this beautiful gem of a place!!!!!!First time I was here I was blown away. Second time around it's even better!!!!!!! Definitely got to try more food and left the restaurant happy and just the right amount of full. Started the night off with a awesomely decorated plate of sashimi. 5 types of fish for 5 people. Now the pic doesn't show 5 separate portions but there was I promise u!!!!! It was simple yet so smart. Next was the shrimp and seasonal veggie tempura.Then the spicy salmon and avocado pressed sushi and amberjack with scallion rollThen we had the 11 piece nigiri ( which was what made me fall madly in love with MIFUNE) Last but not least was my beloved Squid!!!!! Soooooo good here!!!!!I know I said everything was good but their nigiri here was soooo good!!!! One of the BEST I've ever had!!!!!!!!! Would I go back?

3.0,3/28/2019,"The service is fairly good and the decoration/ambiance is plain but clean and presentable.    The quality of the ingredients in the dishes is good enough.  The presentation was sold too.  The only major issue with this restaurant is the taste of the dishes.  They were all pretty underwhelming.   From overly cooked and chewy braised fish to bland miso soup and non-authentic tasting Japanese side dishes, I was sorely disappointed by all of the dishes.  Unfortunately, this is not a restaurant where you want to bring fans of Japanese food.",0,0,0,Joseph S.,"Hartsdale, NY",2,121,0
5.0,3/16/2019,"We had the $125 tasting menu (long one). I really appreciated how they are trying to build a story. For each dish review and rating please see the pics. Everything was superb and oashi. But I would like to add that the chirashi sushi was a bit of anti-climax. I feel like it was more of a filler. Either finish the Wagyu dish with the dessert or doing something like cheese/prosciutto thing might work better as inter-session. More rice would only make too full (from Asian perspective - re portion size).Great services, ambience, selection of food and beverage. They also have many Japanese whisky too, which I intended to try next time). Great use of plate artwork to bonnet the dish presentation.Note: this tasting menu will be changed near the beginning of April to welcome the spring",0,0,0,Jason E.,"New York, NY",55,65,279
1.0,3/9/2019,"Ok honestly, I have never been more disappointed at any of the Japanese restaurants I've been to, all around the world. Like I'm still in shock by how bad this place is. First of all, we put our order in at 7:10 and didn't get food until almost 8. Fine, if it's good we can wait. We ordered about 5 things and every single one of them was a disappointment. The flavour was extremely bland and everything seemed like it's minimal effort. We came in because we heard that the chef use to work at a 3 star Michelin restaurant. However the presentation as well as the taste is basically gourmet garage levelled. I'm not a picky person but this place really is a fancy restaurant wannabe with the most unsophisticated dishes. Like dude, you don't put cod with Brussels sprouts and Chinese cabbage! Their foie gras egg rice dish is just a scam! Just plain rice with one piece of overcooked foie gras and some foamy tasteless egg. Like not even any garnish, r u joking!? On top of it all, it was soooooo overpriced like the whole experience was just messed up. I really hope the chef reads this review one day and go back to culinary school.

4.0,2/25/2019,"My boyfriend took me here for a lovely Valentine's dinner. The food and service were excellent and the waitstaff were very knowledgeable and friendly. We got the Valentine's menu, which included a huge raw oyster with the tastiest yuzu jelly on top, a perfectly cooked sea bass, and a langoustine with lobster bisque, which we were both very impressed by. Note: we're from Maine and Boston so we take seafood pretty seriously ;) The amuse bouche was interesting. It came with a Parmesan canele which was way too hard and dry and a duck and bacon tart, which was tasty but also on the dry side. The cauliflower panne cotta, however, was a huge winner! It was a sweet and salty explosion of flavor and was texturally very interesting, almost melting in my mouth. The Wagyu beef was also a huge standout and one of our favorite courses of the night. I appreciated the much lighter miso soup and seafood rice that came after the super fatty, decadent wagyu beef. They definitely thought the menu through.We also got a flight of sake to share, which was super fun, especially because each one came with its own card containing its flavor profile and where it's from.The only downsides were that the food took a while to get to us in the beginning of the meal (around 9 pm), which was understandable given it was Valentine's day. They did apologize and give us both a complimentary glass of sake for the wait, which was very nice. Also, we were seated downstairs in what honestly felt like someone's unfinished basement. There were maybe 4 or 5 tables down there sectioned off with concrete walls. The ceiling was also completely exposed with wires hanging out. If it wasn't for the couple sitting right next to us and the classic soft rock playing in the background it would've felt a lot creepier. With that said, the excellent service, food, and my lovely date trumped the creepy basement vibe and I still had a wonderful night. Just make sure you get a table in the main dining area if you go!",2,2,2,Lola Y.,"New York, NY",88,18,59
5.0,2/22/2019,Came for dinner on a Friday night. The restaurant's ambiance is relaxed and the staff is extremely kind. Did not order from the tasting menu but enjoyed the separate dishes that were offered. The raw oysters were extremely meaty and super fresh. The choice of 3 types of sashimi (9 pieces) are selected by the chef and each cut was savory and the texture was super buttery and melted in my mouth. The seasonal vegetable tempura was a nice contrast to the seafood dishes selected and I especially enjoyed the sweet corn tempura that was included. The hot stone wagyu was extremely delicious..it was fun cooking the meat to personal preference.

It is a bit on the pricier side for lunch but I find the chirashi here to be a pretty good value for the quality of fish you get. My biggest surprise here was the happy hour which has subsequently changed since the last time I visited (just checked) - the 1 dollar oysters were amongst some of the best I've ever had, especially with the delicious purée on top. Sushi was also pretty good - I wonder if the fish sourcing occurs together with sushi Amane downstairs.

4.0,2/6/2019,"Stopped by sushi amane the other day and decided today I would try the restaurant upstairs. I came here for restaurant week, first course was duck leg meat with potatoes and poached egg, the second was the entree which I got a chirashi box, and lastly, I paid $7 extra to get the hojicha creme brulee. The duck leg was good but the egg was a bit overpowering, the chirashi box didn't have as much sashimi as I'd liked, and it came with way too much rice, and then lastly the creme brûlée was dense but did taste pretty good. Overall, a good experience and $26 was a good price for it. There are also some other lunch sets that are pretty good but I wouldn't recommend coming here at night if you are trying to save $$$Service was decent, overall 4/10 would come back again!",0,0,0,Cindy K.,"New York, NY",330,75,166

They also serve western Asian fusion cuisine, but I haven't tried it yet. The service is quite fine...quite young staff, as are many of the customers, at least at lunch time.

I had this place booked a week in advance and come the day of, my reservation was cleared off my opentable. I assumed it was a mistake on my part because I'm clumsy and my error was possible but decided to call MIFUNE half an hour before arriving just to see if tables were available and I received no response. I put this down as to the restaurant being busy as that has happened to me before. I arrive there and lo and behold there's a sign that says they're CLOSED for the night.

3.0,1/22/2019,"Was quite excited to try this place based off a photo of the snow crab rice hot pot. Service was lovely from start to finish however can't say that the food lived up to my expectations. Started with the pressed spicy salmon sushi and tempura. Tempura was decent however not crispy and the sushi was incredibly salty and the rice was quite mushy. The miso cod lacked seasoning and barley tasted of miso. My friend didn't even want to eat it so I finished it just not to waste. The rice hot pot was a big disappointment as well. Again not seasoned well but the pieces of crab were generous but something was missing from the dish, it needed something to give it more flavor impact.

4.0,1/5/2019,"Excellent sushi restaurant, somewhere between ritzy and regular sushi. I'm normally a regular low-rent sushi guy so this was a step up, but I know there are many pricier steps to premium sushi! My take is this was worth it, for a special splurge. The kid and I had the prix fixe lunch special, with sodas and tip that was $130. For that we got a fair bit of food, appetizers, sushi, and desert. All of them were good but the sushi is what really stood out. The kid and I were both impressed.The ambiance is nice. Not super fancy, but well laid out and easy on the eye. I saw no special reference to the late great Toshiro Mifune (which is really why I chose this place) but I guess a giant statue of Mifune might have been a wee bit tacky!The only slight negative was the service. Don't get me wrong, everyone was polite, but things were a bit slow. No big deal, but in such a small restaurant, which wasn't that busy, it was a little surprising.

1.0,12/28/2018,"I went to Mifune this week for 7 course special Christmas Eve dinner. I am allergic to tree nuts so asked the server if there are any dishes that has nuts in it, he told me there aren't any nuts. However, when I had a small bite on the last dish (French Chocolate Buches de Noel), I got a mild reaction and knew there are nuts in it. I asked the server again what's in the desert. THEN he went to the kitchen and came back saying there are walnuts in the dish. I CANNOT believe he didn't know what's actually on the dish until then and still told me there are no nuts. My symptoms are mild but it could be very dangerous for people who have severe allergies. After that, the server offered me a free drink but I wasn't even drinking so not sure why he tried to give me drinks.. I told him I don't want any drinks and he brought me a scoop of green tea ice cream...Don't think it was a good service and the servers need to be much more careful.",1,0,0,Christine C.,"Edgewater, NJ",0,1,0
5.0,12/26/2018,"I had my Xmas dinner here a few days ago, and I really enjoyed the experience.Food- We had the Christmas set + sake flight. All three sakes we tasted were of high quality. The set itself includes filet mignon, foie gras, crab ceviche, etc. Everything tastes very fresh, well cooked and delicious, and I was very full after finishing the set. In my opinion it is well worth its price tag of $95. One cool detail is that they let us wait a bit longer for our entrees, so in return they gave us complimentary glasses of wine! Atmosphere- the atmosphere here is warm, comfy and romantic. Since it was Xmas night, they had Xmas songs played in background the whole night. All in all, MIFUNE has jumped up to my top 5 nyc Japanese restaurant list. Great food, warm atmosphere, good service.

3.0,11/19/2018,"I saw the $$$$ and high ratings for Mifune, and thought I was in for a fancy fine dining experience. Not! The sushi bar upfront has a pretty standard glass fridge, so you can see all the fish filets wrapped up in clingwrap - not high-end at all.I got the more expensive omakase with beverage pairing, and perhaps that's what contributed to my feelings of being underwhelmed. Perhaps the positive ratings are given by those who just ordered a la carte. My experience was such a mixed bag. Service was all over the place. The front of house was clearly disorganized - about 10 minutes after I got seated, I received a call from the hostess asking if I was on my way. Jeez.The restaurant was filled with raucous Japanese business people having dinner - it's fine, but I think it wasn't quite the fine dining experience I was hoping for. Our server also mixed up one of our plates - we ended up getting more sashimi than we were supposed to, but still. I also got the impression that this was supposed to be French-Japanese but it just felt Japanese to me.The beverage pairing was just ok. I feel like so much about paying for a beverage pairing is the experience of having someone show you a bottle and explain the provenance of the wine - not so much here. Each wine came in an itty-bitty glass and I didn't feel like it showed off the wine very much.In other words - do not come here if you're expecting fancy, because Mifune isn't, despite the price tag.",0,0,0,Jin C.,"New York, NY",36,1100,328

4.0,11/11/2018,"Excellent French-Japanese food, and I'm typically not a big fan of this combination. The reservation felt relatively easy to make, so keep this in your back pocket for last minute celebrations. We ordered a la carte and are happy for it; I wouldn't bother with the tasting menu unless they make some significant changes. Service was a bit slow in the beginning, but definitely picked up in pace and friendliness as the meal went on so good on the team for reading the mood and making adjustments as needed. We started off dinner with 9 pieces, 3 types of sashimi as chosen by the chef -- lightly torched mackerel, red snapper, and salmon. To my great surprise, the mackerel was the dark horse winner of this round: the torching imparted a slight smokey flavor that complimented the fish perfectly. Next, a round of three starters: uni brioche toast, caviar with corn ice cream, and seasonal vegetable tempura. Slight miss on flavor balance with the uni toast and caviar corn ice cream: the uni was fresh and delicious (of course) but overpowered the nori butter and rendered the toast pointless; there was too much corn ice cream to the little dollop of caviar, so while the ice cream was nice, it rendered the caviar pointless -- a phrase I hope to never write again. The vegetable tempura was fantastic.No complaints about the Wagyu Beef Sukiyaki that came next; if you've never tried sukiyaki beef with raw egg yolk as dipping sauce, you are missing out on a delightful flavor and textural experience! Finally, we were lucky to snag one of the 5 per day servings of the Foie Gras and Egg Sabayon over Rice. We paid the additional surcharge for a generous shaving of truffle but on hindsight, this didn't make a big difference to the dish. The foie was perfect, sabayon was insanely silky and light, so each bite felt like smooth, flavored air -- great French twist on the classic Japanese tamago gohan.Having a spot of trouble remembering the exact desserts, but that is not to say they were not excellent. I think one of them was a deliciously gooey, sticky ginger pudding. In short, some of the French twists worked and some didn't, but the Japanese flavors were spot on.

4.0,11/4/2018,"Their tuna rib has a crazy visual. I called ahead to pre-order as directed by their website and it costs $40. Not bad for a ""fun"" way to eat the tuna. You actually eat the tuna from the bone by scooping it with a shell! To be honest, it just tastes like regular minced tuna, but at least I know it's very fresh. We also tried their uni sampler which includes three different types uni from three different regions. They all tasted very good. Their truffle steamed egg was not bad, but i think the truffle taste was not as strong as I have tried in other places. Also had their sake clams which is probably one of my favorite dishes from here. Although the tuna rib didn't taste as good as I expected, it was still a fun experience and their other dishes are actually very good.

1.0,10/26/2018,"MIFUNE is the worst ""japanese"" restaurant in NYC. I went there on a Thursday night with my friends, and it turned out to be a horrible experience. I had never seen a restaurant failed so completely, but MIFUNE did it. Let's firstly start with food. We all ordered the $125 tasting menu in order to try different things, but none of the dishes stands out. They screw up the sashimi, several hot dishes, and even the Miyazaki wagyu, which is nearly impossible to be bad. The blue fin tuna akami tastes like a piece of synthetic protein, and the overcooked and under-seasoned wagyu is one of the worst piece of beef I ever had in my life. Miyazaki wagyu is supposed to be good even eating it raw, but they destroyed the fantastic meat by cutting and grilling it horribly while accompanying with really strange sauce. The only acceptable dishes are the uni and desert. Besides food, the service is also terrible. We spent nearly 3 hours to finish the 9 disastrous dishes, and the our server told us their kitchen is too busy to serve all the customers. What a excuse! Why if you set up all these tables if you cannot serve this number of customers? Moreover, they never refilled our drinks, a bottle of sake brought by us, so we have to do it by ourselves, even though we paid $50 corkage fee. However, compared with the ""sushi/sashimi chef"" who standing behind the sushi counter, these are only minor issues. To be honest, I have never seen a person who is so angry and dissatisfied with his jobs. During our three hours' meal, he never smiled to his colleagues or customers. He carelessly cut all the fishes, and constantly dropped his plates, fishes, and chopsticks on the table and the floor. Just imagine you have to finish a meal while watching this guy for three hours... Lastly, although the decoration of MIFUNE's dinning room is fine, the counter/bar is absolutely distasteful. They used the cheapest material to build the counter, while counter is a critical part for any Japanese restaurant. MIFUNE should just remove the counter since it looks so bad, and they sushi chef does't want to cook at all. Based on my experience, I won't recommend anyone to dine at MIFUNE.",1,0,0,Jason W.,"Framingham, MA",0,3,0
1.0,10/24/2018,"This is not a review about food but I had a really hot experience here last night...hot being the room temperature!  Once upon entering the restaurant warm air came over us and we began to peel our jackets off.  As we approach the back of the restaurant it got even hotter.  I'm famous for wearing a winter jacket inside an air conditioned room on a hot summer day sipping hot tea to keep warm but it's beyond bearable here even for a heat lover like me. Forget about drinking anything hot!  All I wanted was tall glasses of water with lots of ice, which the nice waiter kindly obliged. Never in my life I drank as much iced water in a restaurant as I did last night and went into their even hotter restroom so many times due to so much water I drank during the long 3-hour dinner. The ceiling fans only made it slightly less warm.  With tons of iced water we barely sat thru the three hour dinner.  My dinning partner had to leave the restaurant for cold air in order to finish the rest of dinner.  Under this very uncomfortable condition food became much less enjoyable.  I might do an updated review later on food but the very hot temp in the restaurant left a very unpleasant first impression last night.",0,0,0,Su T.,"Cortlandt, NY",4,1,0

4.0,10/14/2018,"Mifune is probably one of the most underrated Japanese restaurants in New York. I'd heard about it through a friend, who mentioned that the seafood was great, and that their lunch time menus had very good value offerings. We came at 5:30pm on a Friday evening without a reservation, and were seated immediately, though at the bar. I believe there may have been a wait for diners wanting tables without reservations. The ambience is all wooden, with soft, golden lighting that gives the restaurant a chic air. The staff here were very attentive and efficient. Everything about our dining experience was in order. We decided on a few things, oysters to share, and two entrees. The oysters were served first, with a variety of sauces- there was one with a creamy sauce that was particularly delicious, but all were great. The chirashi over sushi rice was super fresh, and perfectly presented. I was a little disappointed with the size of my miso cod, but otherwise had nothing to complain about taste-wise. The waiter had also described this as a main dish, so I thought it would be larger. Overall, we found the serving sizes here to be on the smaller side considering prices, but had a good experience and would dine here again.",0,0,0,Su L.,"Manhattan, NY",122,267,1105
1.0,10/6/2018,"One of the most disappointing Japanese dining experiences in terms of the food. The first one star review I gave... this is by no means super pricey but it's also not cheap.The restaurant smells like seafood and rotten fish the second you walk in. The oysters are not fresh and smell very fishy. There was a piece of fish scale on one of the sushi pieces. The seafood hot pot rice was so hard it tastes like something I cooked at camp... the scallops were pieced together with badly cut slices, instead of being one single slice, and the piece of radish on it was dry.And overall the fish was all fishy and not fresh.... leaving a bad taste in my mouth.",2,2,0,Vicky D.,"New York, NY",573,24,39
4.0,9/14/2018,"Came to MIFUNE to check out the tuna on a rib and ended up getting that plus several other dishes, all of which were great!! We started with the tuna on a rib which was super fun to put together and very fresh!! Then, we had the beef tartar with uni, several pieces of sushi a la carte, Hokkaido uni truffle roll, spicy king salmon roll and the Wagu. It was very good, high end Japanese cuisine with a cool and authentic vibe. There was a large party of about 15 people there, but I think it's more of an intimate restaurant and the portions are too small to share. We ended our meal with the two desserts (don't remember which) and they were amazing - leave room for dessert and green tea for sure!!",2,0,2,Biana G.,"Brooklyn, NY",455,121,120
5.0,9/13/2018,"Long post ahead! Skip to the bottom for tldr! Initially my friend and I had made lunch reservations to take advantage of their restaurant week menu. Rather than sticking to the restaurant week chooses, we decided to get their three course lunch set, and an order of their  Hokkaido uni truffle roll to share. For starters, we both opted for their foie gras pâté which was not only beautifully presented, but practically melted in our mouths. It wasn't too heavy or overwhelming, and didn't leave a coat of fat on your tongue like some pâté's. The crackers (?) they came with were.... hard... not sure what they were made of but it paired well so no complaints there.The Hokkaido uni truffle roll came next. Generous portions of fresh uni, and truffles. 10/10 would recommend. More of a treat yourself kind of dish ($30 for 6 pieces) but worth every penny for such fresh uni topped with truffles.For our entrées we both ordered the chirashi sushi box which came with a box of sashimi, a second box of rice topped with salmon roe, and a final box of rice with a picked radish and mushrooms. Each box could be eaten individually or paired together. All ingredients were extremely fresh, and left us so full we almost couldn't eat dessert. Went back for dinner. My group of 5 requested the tuna rib ($40) to share and it was one of the most unique experiences I've had at a restaurant. We also ordered a chirashi box, the cod with Parmesan foam, foie gras chawanmushi, black angus beef tare tare with uni, and rice topped with uni (and maybe wagyu.... no longer remember). The tuna rib was great fun for the 5 of us and made a ton of hand rolls - it's he perfect appetizer for a group! The foie gras chawanmushi reminded be of siilky tofu esq steamed egg, flavor was amazing and melted in my mouth. The beef tare tare was seasoned in some sort of ponzu sauce and would've tasted even better if they had paired it with some toast. The rice was by far my favorite dish of that night along with the chirashi which has yet to disappoint.TLDR: deff worth it to try their lunch sets, very filling and food is great. Try the tuna rib if you ever get the change. Anything uni is good. 100/10 would recommend. Great for lunch and dinner.

Our dishes came more than 5 minutes apart, leaving one of us to twiddle our thumbs. Had to ask two different servers for the green tea we ordered, which only arrived when my meal was half finished. Water and tea was never refilled, and when it was time to get the check it was impossible to flag down any servers. To his credit, the chef eventually noticed this and got someone to bring it.

5.0,8/5/2018,"The Chef's Tasting Menu was divine. It was an 8 course meal starting with a truffle egg custard and hakkaido uni sushi. Next its a selection of sashimi determined by the chef. After some fish, the next course is a crispy arare battered scallop with a bonito dashi sauce. Incredible tender and delicate scallop was crisped so perfectly. Then it got a little fancy with a seared red shrimp with ossetra caviar. Next was a broiled gindara (Alaskan black cod) served with a fun parmesan foam! After this tasty fatty fish, the last of the surf, it was followed by the turf: premium aged angus beef steak which I recommend medium rare because it was cooked perfectly at this temperature. After a taste of non seafood, it goes back to seafood to finish it off with either a king crab and ikura takikomi rice or a foie gras egg rice. I was lucky to have had both. The king crab was a little salty and the foie gras was simply rich in incredible flavor.  The dessert was a diappointment as it was not even authentic.

The best oysters we have ever had.We were also at MIFUNE for Restaurant Week. For the appetizer, had the luscious and savory soymilk vichyssoise with the caviar on top. And the entree - my oh my - the broiled miso cod with the parmesan foam was as close to perfection as I have ever had. Savory and buttery. I truly almost wanted to cry with joy.(Had the chocolate cake. Thick, rich, a little dry. Could use some cream or gelato. But perfectly fine.)Absolutely zero feelings of ever being rushed.

3.0,7/29/2018,"Came here for dinner during the summer restaurant week. Nice ambiance, not too loud and not too dimly lit either! Food:-Trout salmon: 3.5/5. Nothing spectacular but it was refreshing and a good appetizer to start. The fish was a little fishy though.-Chirashi bowl: 4/5. Very well presented and all the fish seemed fresh. It came with two different kinds of rice (one sweeter with mushrooms and the other more savory with Japanese chives) which I thought were pretty interesting. I preferred the one with chives more but it was a little plain in terms of texture since it didn't have much besides the fish to pair with it. I personally thought there was an excessive amount of rice to fish ratio though.-Chocolate cake: 4/5. Yum! Kind of like a fudgy brownie. Very rich in chocolate flavor and definitely indulgent. Would have been better if paired with ice cream or some cream to counter the sweetness.Service: 3/5. As mentioned, it was very slow. They did not clear our table after each course until our next set of entrees were ready and brought to our table. Of course, at that time it was then that they realize they do not have enough space and hands to clear the table and place down our new plates. This happened for all three courses, which was kind of irritating. Also, our dishes took especially long to be served for some reason. That being said, despite their inefficiency, everyone was generally very friendly and helpful!",1,1,1,Jennifer H.,"New York, NY",173,57,99

And it had an alcohol content I would feel comfortable allowing a three year old child to imbibe. So we started off the dinner already feeling ripped off. The dinner was good. The sushi was fresh and some of the dishes were inventive. But we went for the Special Uni Tasting Course, and they didn't have the main thing that drew us to Mifune in the first place: the Brioche Bun for the Brioche-Bun-with-Uni-Dish.

5.0,7/28/2018,"After seeing this place in an Eater vid months ago, I was super excited to try it for NYC Restaurant Week. For years I've been avoiding RW because it's normally such a ripoff but MIFUNE was delicious and completely worth the trip!I was able to try my dining companion's other appetizer and dessert choices but we both chose the black cod with parmesan foam as well as shared an additional appetizer ($9 for beef tartare).All the appetizers were super refreshing and layers of flavor. The soymilk vichyssoise was like a cold creamy version of tofu stew, while the trout salmon appetizer was a bit more bold in flavor (and much better than your basic crudo/sashimi appetizer). The beef tartare was also delicious!The black cod with parmesan foam totally blew my expectations away. I was worried about the parm and went in thinking it'd be a hit or miss, but the parmesan foam didn't come across as cheesy, but rather added more umami (like truffles). In that sense, it paired extremely well with the miso flavor and just added to the earthy savoryness. The fish itself was cooked wonderfully and just melted with every bite.I'll definitely be back for a weekday lunch sometime and get my hands on more of that dish!",2,2,2,Ivy Z.,"New York, NY",9,77,272

However, since then he just totally ignored our table even though passing by our table multiple times. Our questions was no answers. 2) we were then left with no attention by anyone. I tried to call another waiter for check, and that request was ignored again. We finally got our check after being left there for over 20 mins and after we talked to the manager.

5.0,7/1/2018,"My first five star rating on Yelp goes to this Japanese restaurant in NYC. I came here with my girl friends on Saturday, much earlier hour than my typical dinner. I wasn't even hungry but when I saw the course menu with Sake pairing, I just couldn't resist trying it. I'm a huge fan of ""Kikizake"", sake tasting, so I knew I could enjoy different kinds of Sake. But I was intrigued by the idea of pairing Sake with Japanese food, which typically doesn't have much variations in flavor like French. To my pleasant surprise, those 6-7 glasses of sake came in generous portion and at the perfect pairing concept to each plate of the course. A $100 course meal for sure tasted delicious, and a $70 pairing gave me no less than series of Junmai Daiginjo and Daiginjo. But those to me were already given deal and known fact. What was amazingly unique at MIFUNE was that their Japanese course meal stood in the perfect edge where Japanese tradition and Western fusion crossed over with sake pairing. Last but not least, wait staffs were pleasant, charming and attentive.偶々人に勧められて、何も知らずに初めて入った和食レストラン。コースと日本酒のペアリングを頼んで大満足でした。懐石の様なマンネリ感もなく、アジアンフュージョン特有の無理矢理感もなく、一皿毎に日本酒とのカップリングが絶妙でした。月替わりでコースメニューも変わるとの事、定期的に訪れたいレストランです。",3,2,2,Yukari E.,"Queens, NY",0,25,101

The server told us that the chefs, tho were Japanese, studied/worked in France and hence had a good understand about Japanese French fusion. In general we found this a great experience because we did see many interesting ideas. The chef definitely had a very deep understanding about french cuisine and blended it well with the traditional Japanese cuisine.We decided to start with foie gras cream brûlée, served with corn chips and plum paste. It's a interesting idea, tho it didn't wow us.Then, Chawanmushi, served cold with uni on top. Again, I definitely sensed the thoughts and creativity in this dish. Both friend and I were huge uni fans. We definitely loved this dish. But nothing overwhelmingly amazing. Uni rolls. The server added truffle for us because we wanted to order truffle sukiyaki which ran out(truffle season was over). The uni and truffles were both very good but the rice was a bit bland. Vegetables and scallops tempura- it was definitely a well made dish. Ingredients were very fresh. The sauce was on point.Duck casserole- my fav dish and highlight of the night. Parmesan cheese crips on top, and very creamy cheesy soup with lightly smoked duck, bacon and veggies.We ordered another main dish, grilled wagyu, but the server/kitchen forgot to put into the order.

2.0,4/24/2018,"I'm surprised by the good reviews for Mifune. Our view of the dishes ranged from unimpressed to disappointed. Especially for the price, there's definitely not a single dish that makes me want to go back.I'll start with the good: it's very nice, classy decor and ambiance (although it was a bit loud when we were there) and pretty good service you would expect from a Japanese restaurant. While service was attentive, the food pacing was very off and slow. Perhaps it's because I ordered a tasting menu but my dinner companions did not, but throughout the meal, the food did not come out at the right time. At one point, a course on the tasting menu is the same dish my companions ordered (aka we had 2 of the same dish) and they still came out at different times! Extremely strange. For the food:- I had the vegetarian tasting menu. I thought my tempura and dessert were solid but did not like my other dishes. One of my dishes was steamed vegetables. The vegetables didn't even taste super fresh or seasonal. It tasted like steamed vegetables you get at the mall food court. One of my other dishes was mushroom takikomi rice. It was chopped up mushrooms over a bowl of rice. Like the steamed vegetables, extremely flavorless and underwhelming. I didn't taste any seasoning on this dish at all.- Foie gras brulee - one person at the table had been looking forward to trying this dish. Unfortunately, it was more like pate than a true foie gras. The brulee part was not very interesting and added nothing to the dish. - Miso cod - one of the better dishes on the table. Fish was tender, good flavor. Not as good as the miso cod at other Japanese places such as Nobu and Zuma. - Wagyu steak - meat did not taste high quality and the stone it came on was not hot enough, so it took the meat longer and longer to cook.- Pork belly - the pork belly itself was tender but the sauce it came with did not fit the meat. Too saucy and took away from the pork belly. Although the restaurant has such high reviews, it was extremely empty on a Friday night. We were one of maybe 5 tables dining there. Given the location, it might just be more of a lunch place than a dinner place. Either way, I certainly will not be coming back.",3,4,1,Cat S.,"Manhattan, NY",447,371,0

4.0,4/21/2018,"Mifune is a decent restaurant with several things going its way;  One could tell that a lot of careful detail went to the flow of the general decor.  There is an accentuation on wood, soft lighting and general warmth of the atmosphere.  One thing that was perhaps a bit odd is the concrete wall on one side of the dining room with some metal bars which gives some diners almost a trapped feeling.  The noise level in the restaurant is very well balance and one could easily have a conversation which was very much appreciated;  the music choices are a bit odd and misplaced for the atmosphere and would be great if this was thought out a bit more.  As far as the food, the menu is not precise in its description of the food versus the reality of what the dish is so the diner does not have a good representation of what they will be eating before the dish is served.  I would suggest for the staff to do a better job (or cast as they call it) to spend a little more detail on writing a menu which offers insight into the key ingredients and presentation of each dish.  The Sashimi was exceptionally fresh which is an extremely important marker for a Japanese restaurant and the other fish dish we had, the Miso Cod was very well prepared with a melt in your mouth consistency.  Some of the other dishes such as the Beet Salad with Miso Dressing could be reasonably improved as it had little creativity and was mostly mixed green with thin slices of Beets. The rice dish with vegetables was also lacking in flavor, and was a little scarce in both variety and amount of vegetables.  The service here is fantastic, and the wait staff does everything possible to meet the customer's every need and ask. Overall, definitely worth a try with perhaps more of a focus on their fish and sashimi and also give their drinks a whirl as the mixologist knows what he is doing.  Some of the other veggie and rice dishes need some improvement so I would hold off of ordering those for now..",0,0,0,Irina S.,"Manhattan, NY",15,10,0

3.0,3/21/2018,"Japanese/French restaurants have been very much the ""thing"" in Tokyo and actually throughout Japan for about three decades, and command very high prices. So it was just a matter of time before we started seeing them over here. Inherently and invariably it is creative and contemporary. Its mere existence requires this kind of restaurant to meld ethnically different culinary styles. Mifune is for the most part pretty successful in this endeavor.  In Tokyo it may not rank amongst the very top (A+/A) tier of this style but would be a very respectable B/B-. The divergence with the top tier may be due to a combination of location and experience - which may make them think that tastes should be strong (making some dishes taste more like a forced marriage than a blissful merger) and that they must offer truffles with almost everything and that there must always be ""sushi"" and beef offerings. Kitchen execution could also improve - scallops, while perfectly ""cooked"" temperature wise, should be seared so as to have a bit of crust instead of the same (soft) texture top through middle, cod, while also ""correct"" temperature wise, should be juicier and so on. It's a bit telling if the most memorable dish of the night was a rice dish (foie gras over rice) which they indicate is with eggs but has no noticeable ""egg"" taste in an otherwise well prepared dashi sabayon like sauce.Also, it must be noted that service is nice but not spot on as wait staff are not as attentive as they should be in the class of restaurant they aspire to be and dishes are not brought out in a timely or in a coordinated manner (all 4 main dishes were brought out at separate times with the last person being served a near 30 minutes after the first).Overall good but room for lots of improvement in every phase of the operation. 1st class prices but not quite 1st class experience - but worth trying and judging for your self.

We sat at the front counter, it was not the head chef, but another Japanese chef who didn't seem that interested or focus in preparing his dishes. He would carelessly stuff ingredients back to sushi roll rather re-doing it when he had made a mistake. One of my dish was missing a pesto sauce when my partner with the exact same plate has the pesto drizzle.

3.0,1/31/2018,"A girlfriend and I had Gilt City vouchers which entitled us to a rice lunch box, tea or coffee and a dessert for $20.  We made a reservation, and trekked over on a frigid day.  I want to note that there are three doors/curtains to the entrance of the restaurant to prevent cold air from seeping into the airy contemporary interior.  We were promptly seated, and upon reminding the waiter we were using Gilt vouchers, he detailed our options kindly.  After taking our orders, our roasted tea was quickly brought out in individual pots, and then followed by the foie gras terrine (accompanied by hacho miso and corn chips). We enjoyed the terrine, though we did find a sinewy piece in the middle which was not aesthetically pleasing, but we both found the chips very dry and bland.  I know this is meant to enhance the flavor of the terrine, but if you blindfolded me and handed me cardboard, I wouldn't be able to differentiate the taste, not that I'm in the habit of eating cardboard.We then waited quite a long time for our lunch entree, I suspect that they may have been trying to allow for a relaxed lunch and thought we were leisurely enjoying the terrine, but we were sort of disinterested after the sinew and ready to move onto our entrees. Shortly after notifying the waitstaff that we were ready for our entree, beautiful trays were brought to our table and unveiled to us. We both decided to have the Mifune Chirashi box, and it was beautiful.  The chirashi was fresh and sliced into generous pieces, and two gorgeous types of rice were provided in separate stacked trays as if they were gems: a vinegar seasoned mushroom (& marinated bamboo?) rice topped with mini scallions and a sliced omelet and salmon roe rice.  To accompany, there were a couple of tiny side dishes (spinach in sesame oil, and crisp green beans, mushrooms and tofu), a miso soup, and a salad of mixed greens with sliced radishes. We both enjoyed the presentation and the light taste of the chirashi. I want to say the style is Teishoku rather than Kaiseki, but I'm no expert.We finished with the soba tea blanc-manger (I think of this as a very light version of a panna cotta or a flan) with kibito caramel ice cream and the gateau chocolat with kinako ice cream. My friend loved the kinako ice cream paired with a little fresh strawberry and the dense chocolate cake was almost like a brownie. I preferred the delicate blanc-manger's creaminess paired with the toasted sugar flavor of the caramel ice cream.All in all, it was a pleasant dining experience, and I'd definitely return if I had time to enjoy a relaxed meal with great companionship.  I do have my eye on the Oharu cocktail: lychee cello, soju and orange blossom.",2,0,0,Jennifer C.,"Flushing, NY",74,100,429

The lamb chops were medium rare, and filled with smoky aroma; it also paired nicely with the garlic sauce.

2.0,1/3/2018,"**This is not a review of their food**I got nowhere near their food, or even the door of their restaurant.I made dinner reservations a day ahead for my dad's Birthday evening.  My parents were visiting me from out of town and it happen to be the first Birthday we were able to celebrate together in over 12 years. I wanted to make up for all the previous Birthdays I've missed and decided to take both of my parents for a course meal.The getleman who initially took my reservation was so pleasant that my excitement was at all time high once the reservation was complete over the phone.  I asked that they not bring the menu out to us and just to have it noted that we would be having the Chef's Tasting Menu. I did not want my parents to know what the dinner was costing me.  I asked if MIFUNE had anything special they can do for the Birthday person and he took down my dad's name so they can decorate his dessert plate. PERFECT!! As soon as the dinner reservation was completed I made a reservation at the parking lot nearby so my parents wouldn't need to take their wallet out to cover miscellaneous costs to have this dinner.  I paid $30, which was non-refundable. (lost this money)The next day came and 30 minutes before our 7pm dinner, I called the restaurant to let them know I may be 5-10 minutes late for my reservation with all the rush hour traffic and I was flat out told that MY RESERVATION WAS CANCELLED because their building was having trouble since the beginning of the day and their restaurant was unable to operate.The initial person told me that they tried calling me several times but the number was a non working number. Instead of dialing my ""646"" NY area code, they dialed 616 because that's how my information was taken down by the gentlemen. I REPEATED MY PHONE NUMBER TO THE GUY THREE TIMES during my reservation and even laughed and made a small comment about my phone number having these 6s and 4s repeat so much to the end.I had both of my parents in the car with me, the restaurant on the car Bluetooth speaker (because I was driving) and they were hearing all of this.I was livid,but was trying to keep calm. I soon completely lost control of my anger when the call was transferred to the restaurant's manager. He hardly spoke English, but regardless of the language barrier, any person with common sense knows that a customer would not be happy in this situation.  And no doubt, my voice clearly said ""angry.""Whether I made comments or asked questions, I kid not when I say this, all he said was ""Uh-huh, okay, and yea"" for the first 5-6 minutes of our... um... ""conversation.""  He literally said ""uh-huh yea okay"" when I asked him, ""what can you do for me and my parents at this point?""  When I told him, ""I stopped driving and parked illegally by the fire hydrant so I can simply talk on the phone, because I am so furious that I can't drive calmly while discussing this."" He simply said in such a monotonous voice, ""yea okay"" and without saying anything further, left us with such an awkward long silence.I finally asked him to hand the phone over to someone who spoke English when I asked him if he understood what I was saying to him and he said ""okay"" as the response.My phone call went back and forth between the initial lady (Jill) who picked up my call, the manager, and the assistant manager of the restaurant.I decided to give two stars ONLY because Jill and the assistant manager really tried to help find and make a new reservation for us at another Japanese restaurant that offered course menus.  They both had me on the phone while searching and reading out menus and prices of their competitive restaurants and I really did appreciate their effort to save our evening.My parents having heard my frustrating and, frankly, very bizarre conversation with the manager, and having to watch me pace around outside the car during this freezing NYC weather to discretely rearrange the dinner reservation, lost their appetite for an extensive 2hr course meal and asked that we go for a completely different cuisine with simple a la carte menu.This REALLY killed my day.  Having a dinner reservation be cancelled for whatever reason CAN happen.  Even this cancellation was not entirely MIFUNE's fault.  It was a problem with the building and their kitchen could not operate. But it was their lack of action, sensibility, and interest to fix/accomodate their affected customers.Of course, MIFUNE had no idea this day was THIS HUGE for me, but even so, no customer who had their plans ruined at last minute by the restaurant's own fault deserve a monotonous ""uh-huh, yea...,okay"" as their apology, comment, solution, and response.No matter how great the chef.. without better reception/hospitality (or a new manager...) this ""notable"" restaurant may be thinning their chance of someday getting their Michelin star, or simply customers.I was left with such a bad taste in my mouth that I can't imagine their food can ever undo it.",0,0,0,Grace L.,"Union City, NJ",0,1,0

First my friend and I each ordered a rice bowl- she ordered a vegetable bowl, and I guess the waiter misheard and brought us steamed vegetables. They were fine- but not what I would order at a restaurant. We let him know he had brought out the wrong item and he said he'd been confused. Ok- mistakes happen. Fine. But then the waiter also seemed completely confused by my relatively simple question- is the salmon in the rice bowl raw or cooked? He told me it was raw. It was not. It was quite cooked. And I'm not a fan of cooked fish. I ate a few bites or my food and a few bites of my friend's dish- but I am leaving a bit hungry. And then...we ordered a second round of beverages, and my friend ordered a pinot blanc. And he brought out a Cabernet. When she pointed out it was the wrong wine, he said he was confused. He went back and stared at the menu for a long time and then brought out a white wine that was still too dark to be a pinot blanc, but at least it was the right color wine. And then two minutes later a different waitress came by with what appeared to be the correct white wine and said ""here is your pinot blanc,"" saw that my friend had a different drink and then walked away confused.

5.0,11/28/2017,"KenScale: 9.0/10One of the major restaurant trends in New York City this year has been the influx of high-end (i.e. very expensive) Japanese restaurants offering the top-echelon sushi, kaiseki or other tasting experiences. One place that opened this summer that has been under my radar is Mifune, which is on the ""modern"" side of Japanese cuisine led by a chef who used to run a highly acclaimed restaurant Sola in Paris until it closed due to a fire. On the evening before Thanksgiving, my wife Jun and I stopped by for a visit; since we are both fans of refined Japanese cuisine, we knew we were more likely than not to have an average or above-average meal. What we didn't realize is that Mifune is one of the best new restaurant openings of the year!Mifune has both a la carte and tasting menu options; if you want to explore the full range of dishes that the kitchen brings to the table, I would recommend without reservations going all out for the eight-course options (at $120 per person, which may sound expensive but still a bargain relative to other high-end Japanese places in the city). The first course, a combination of truffle egg chawanmushi and sea urchin from Hokkaido, provided some nice scoops/bites to kick off the meal, followed by an assortment of fresh sashimi (Jun and I got tuna, salmon and amberjack). What came next was a series of home-run seafood dishes that were nothing short of spectacular. Jun is quite sensitive to raw fish types like scallop. The one at Mifune came out in crispy battered form inside bonito dashi sauce. The textural effect of the lightly battered scallop was not only exquisite but with the dashi sauce, the subtle yet elegant flavor combination wowed Jun so much that she declared this was one of the best dishes she's had all year. Seared red shrimp with caviar was also astounding. I only experienced a shrimp lightly seared like this at a restaurant in Spain (which still has the highest all-time KenScale rating); the smoky sensation from the shrimp, combined with the caviar that was an icing on the cake, was just magnificent. Broiled gindara (a cod that is frequently used for the popular ""black miso"" version in other modern Japanese restaurants like Nobu) came out accompanied by Parmesan foam; I thought the dish could come out a little less sweet, but nevertheless it was another winner. For meat, we got the premium aged angus beef steak that I thought was more or less perfectly cooked and would've been better if it had lost a bit of the red wine reduction sauce on top of which the meat was sitting. The last savory course was a flavorful snow crab and ikura rice which Jun and I both liked (although she wished we had a side of pickles to complement the rice). When the dessert came out, I knew instantly that Jun would give a high score to this place. She always loves tiramisu, but Mifune impressed her even more with matcha version (accompanied also by red wine strawberry confit). I was getting full by then, so I gladly let Jun have the rest of the tiramisu after I got a couple of scoops.Getting a reservation at Mifune wasn't too difficult (perhaps because we visited during the time of the year when everyone leaves town for Thanksgiving?) but the restaurant became moderately packed in the course of our meal. Maybe it didn't help that the restaurant also sits on a quiet corner of Midtown East neighborhood that becomes a ghost town during off-work hours. The dining space has the modern (but not kitschy) feel that could make the restaurant work for a variety of formal and casual occasions. There is full bar with some carefully thought out cocktail and sake options to complement the meal. Mifune offers sophisticated but not over-the-top Japanese dishes that may look familiar but still have subtle and unexpected twists here and there for an exceptional dining experience. Jun and I would love to come back again in the near future.",5,3,3,Ken S.,"Manhattan, NY",512,612,4738
5.0,11/27/2017,"Ever since this restaurant opened up in July of this year, I have been very curious about them. The restaurant is named after Toshiro Mifune, the famed Japanese actor who appeared in almost 170 feature films from the 1940s to 1990s. He won some prestigious awards for his work, and this restaurant is going to make him proud with amazing and delicious creations of their own.The first thing that we saw was a counter table with chairs. It is always good to have a counter seating for customers who comes to eat alone, or likes to order just sushi/sashimi items. Then the vast, large space opened up in front of our eyes. The dining room is again clean, simple but yet elegant. The design is a mix of modern and old-fashion Japanese style, with pretty cool light fixture and wooden wall around the bar. I saw many Japanese patrons here, a really good sign that the Japanese food offered here is getting a seal of approvals from other Japanese foodies.We started off with some cocktails. They had nice selection of wines, sake, Japanese whiskey and more. We ordered Oharu and Rasho-Mon. The cocktails were named after movies and characters from movies that Mifune was featured in, which is pretty clever. The drinks were elegant and sophisticated, really smooth. For food, we decided to go with one of their course menus, MIFUNE Tasting Menu, which is a six-course meal. They also have eight-course, and vegetarian tasting menu. All in all, it was an amazing dinner. We enjoyed every bite of every dish. There was not a single dish that let us down. I had high expectation, but this place surprised me with such incredible dishes, surpassed my expectation completely. Throughout the delectable and mouthwatering course, we also had several additional dishes, outside the course meal. These items also sent us to foodie heaven. Our waitress, Fatima was so sweet, polite, friendly and wonderful. She took a great care of us. All the other staffs who took care of us were really nice too.

1.0,10/24/2017,"I would not recommend this place to anyone. I think every aspect of this dinner was bad.  I had to flag down the server to even come by when I first arrived. Only gave one hot towel - are we sharing this? The server kept forgetting our order and we would have to ask him for our orders over and over. Also we ordered the 5 piece sashimi and he was bringing out all the food at once. We asked him to slow down and I think at this point he left some of the food in the kitchen for it to get cold. The wagyu was DISGUSTING. I don't believe it was wagyu at all and it was cold. It didn't pair well with the uni and the ""wagyu"" was very chewy. We returned this dish. The fish for the 5 piece sashimi were not good at all except for the salmon and scallop. The foie gras dishes were good. Drinks were strong and for a person who can drink like a fish I had to ask to redo my drink. When we finally got the check and we paid. They came back with someone else's credit card with ours. I feel bad for the person who lost their card. Anyway, I hate writing negative reviews because it's someone's livelihood and hard work and I hope they can fix this place up.

5.0,10/21/2017,"Excellent menu with wide selection of sushi and seafood items as well as myriad options for foie gras and steak. Setting was bright and zen-like with lots of light wood. Service was outstanding and the recommendations by the waitress were on-point! Started off with a cold appetizer that was the weakest item of the evening - I would skip it next time: Smoked Butter FishGarlic Green Sauce Organic RadishThe following are excellent and must-haves:-Smoked Foie Gras with Mango Chutney (hot appetizer - rich, flavorful, served over a piece of homemade brioche toast and, interestingly, topped with corn)-Broiled Gindara Miso Codwith Parmesan Foam (thick, tender, succulent piece of fish)-Roasted Wagyu Wasabi Soy Sauce (prepared as requested medium rare Japanese beef, marbled, appropriately fatty, aromatic, tasty)Also tried the Sushi trio which is a nice-to-have:-Hokkaido uni & caviar-Tuna & truffle-Salmon & ikura For dessert, tried the matcha mousse monaka and the gateau chocolat (cake) - the best part of each dessert was the kinako soybean ice cream.The savory items are obviously the stars of the meal and really elevate the dining experience",1,0,0,Rose I.,"Manhattan, NY",105,441,3759
3.0,10/20/2017,"Mifune has a nice comfortable decor . High ceilings,no table cloths , ample space between tables. Downstairs has private rooms. Which is what I think will enhance this type of meal .   The food is reasonably priced kaiseki style compared to other places of this type. The chawanmushi was excellent, the uni roll that this accompanied needs improvement. The Nori was soggy, the dish tasted pre-made and refrigerated. The foie gras egg rice was a standout dish . I recommend that if ordering aka carte. We had the tasting menu but added wagyu beef course. That dish quality was not great. The meat was unlike an A5 that would melt in your mouth. It was a bit tough and chewy. The sirloin that comes with the tasting menu was better.  The sashimi course was excellent. This will get me to try their sushi bar. The grilled black cod was a good dish, but quite common and not unique at all.    The service had some flaws. They brought dishes out while we were still enjoying previous course.Some servers are better than others. Our main server put our plates directly on top of our chopsticks. Another server had to fill our water glasses. All staff should be trained properly.    I will return, I think they need to get the kinks out and improve on some of the dishes.

I liked every course, which doesn't always happen, and service was tentative but not intrusive.

My favorite of the evening was the foie gras/rice dish- so delicious. As others pointed out, the steak was also our least favorite. It wasn't bad but the other dishes were such standouts that it pales in comparison. The hostess was pleasant and professional. Our server did a nice job but for the type of restaurant I expected her to be a little better informed about the dishes. To her defense, she did find out the answers for us and reported back so maybe she was just new. Nonetheless she was pleasant and professional.

5.0,8/23/2017,"I recently found out about Mifune New York while overhearing a conversation from some patrons at another restaurant--they raved about how wonderful the service was and how good the food was. After a few minutes, I couldn't help but interrupt them and inquire on Mifune. The next day, I made reservations and was immediately accommodated. I have a few dietary restrictions and they beyond mindful and asked beforehand is I had any food allergies. The head hostess who took my reservation, Lorraine, was super sweet and a delight to converse with along with the Japanese manager--I believe he said his name was Tahkahiro. I arrived with my party of 5 and they made sure everyone was happy, well taken care of, and in good spirits. Now onto the food, the food was simply splendid!!!  The seared red shrimp was bursting with flavor, the broiled gindara miso cod was mouth watering, and the tuna avocado roll was fresh and tasty. Overall, I look forward to coming back and perhaps even having dinner at the other restaurant downstairs.

5.0,8/20/2017,"This is probably one of my new favorite Japanese restaurants in New York. We had the chef's tasting course at $120pp, several a la carte items, bottle of champagne (Philippe Gonet), bottle of white wine, and I must say everything was fantastic. From the chawanmushi with uni to their unique take on the tamago kake gohan with foie gras, everything was amazing. Even without the a la carte items, the chef's tasting course was filling. They have several a la carte options that were influenced by Dieci's menu (which was my favorite) and I will definitely go back to try the rest of the menu. Service was friendly, warm and attentive. Everything was brought out at the right time, with no rush or wait. They always made sure your water is filled and your wine glass is not empty. The drink menu was extensive and they have a full bar serving cocktails (crafted by Shingo himself) too. The only comment from me is that the music was weird - playing some sort of loud clubby/hip hop beats which sort of didn't jive with the high end atmosphere they were aiming for. But that can be easily remedied with some cool jazz or something more relaxing.",1,0,1,Michael C.,"Brooklyn, NY",2,5,0

4.0,8/18/2017,"I came by Mifune for lunch and with a reservation, though there was no need because the place was nearly empty at 12:30 PM. As I understand it, this is a pretty new restaurant, only having opened a month or so ago. For lunch, they have a 2-3 course style menu with multiple options so that you can build your own meal. I opted for the fluke carpaccio appetizer, Berkshire pork belly main dish, and a peach-olive-oil ice cream and chocolate cake for dessert.The service was a little odd. I think the waiter must not have had much experience, because it was clear that he was very nervous and kept forgetting things. At one point, as I was ordered the dessert, the waiter could not remember if it was served with peaches or pineapples, and after standing there trying to remember, rushed back into the kitchen to figure it out (fyi, that dessert came with BOTH pineapples and peaches, lol). The fluke carpaccio was deliciosu and light. The fluke sashimi had a very mild taste and chewy texture. The sauce (not sure what it was) added a crisp acidity that was accentuated by the little slices of tomatoes. It was in all about 6 pieces. I thoroughly enjoyed that course.The main course I ordered was the Berkshire pork belly. When the menu says it comes with ""three sides,"" remember that this is a Japanese restaurant - you're not going to get giant scoops of mashed potatoes or a basket full of fries. You are getting literally a dish the size of a half-dollar coin with 6 slivers of pickled vegetables. Everything tasted fine, so I guess I can't really complain, but this is a warning to people unfamiliar with Japanese food to not be expecting more. The pork belly was EXTREMELY rich, and this is coming from a guy who doesn't cut away the fat on his steaks. Each bite releases a ton of oil. It tasted amazing and I enjoyed it, but I'm sure many would not be happy by its extreme fatiness. Order at your own discretion. The dessert of olive oil ice cream was interesting, especially since they didn't give me a spoon (just a fork...). The dark chocolate cake it came with was good, but nothing to rave about. Overall, a nice experience, albeit pricey at $45 without tax. I think I'd be interested in coming back for lunch to try their other options!",4,0,0,Justin Y.,"Washington, DC",801,355,90

Instead, we spent 2.5 hrs just waiting for the food to come, believe it or not.Regarding the food, nothing impressed me. Definitely not worth $120. Any Japanese restaurants you see in NYC, if you spend $120 there, I am sure you will get way much better treat.Ok, enough to say...avoid this restaurant if possible...",3,1,0,April Y.,"Flushing, Queens, NY",3,9,4
1.0,8/15/2017,"First, the hot towel served on arrival has a very strong mold smell. It was so bad that it would stay on my hand even after washing thoroughly. It'd be better without it. We complained to the server, but there was no follow up whatsoever.Secondly, we tried the tasting menu, priced at $120 which is not unreasonable per se. However, the portions are among the tiniest I've ever had, over at least 50 similarly priced restaurants I tried over the years. Sadly the dishes are simply not good enough to counter the strange portion. The tempura dish is of same quality as complimentary ones at Ramen shop. The beef dish is chewy at best. The foie gras is overcooked. As we concluded the dinner, one of the server splashed a glass amount of sparklingly wine over my back. Amazingly, their apology is a round of free sparkling wine/champagne. What a joke.",4,5,0,LH G.,"Jersey City, NJ",0,2,0
1.0,8/11/2017,"I was pretty disappointed by the service and food.The black lady who arranges seating was rude and insisted having us sitting at the entry door area even tho we had a reservation. She also insisted that the restaurant had a full reservation, which was  a lie based on our observation of about 60% seating.My comment abt the food quality is based on the chef tasting. In short, the flavors and food itself was nothing great. First course made with ponzu and uni. Second course was a bland salad. Tempera was not crispy. Shrimp was good.The worst of all was the angus steak. The steak entry came with wasabi...... and the meat itself was just not chewable. I would much prefer if I did not have to have this entree at all. Or potentially pay higher price for a slightly better quality meat. The dessert, however, was a surprise.

5.0,7/26/2017,"Cuisine: 9Service: 7Decor: 8Value: 9Overall: 9This is the Japanese restaurant opening I have been waiting for. OMG! Slap me silly and called me Uni-san. Each dish here is prepared with painstakingly intricate precision, while hitting the perfect balance between flavor and texture. I've been to many new Japanese restaurants trying desperately to discover the next big thing. Well folks, we have a major contender.The restaurant has a 10 seat bar upfront and a narrow passageway leading to a dining room. Overall, I really like the design of the space, but the dance/pop music over the speakers mismatched the zen-like cuisine. As for service, Chef Tomohiro Urata behind the counter was extremely friendly. However, my waitress did leave my tea cup often empty, and even forgot to bring it back once.We opted for the 8 course chef's tasting and added one extra appetizer to share. I cannot honestly remember the last new restaurant (especially Japanese food since I am insanely jaded) where my mouth danced with such uncontrollable enthusiasm. At this point, you can stop reading my novel and call for a reservation before the word gets out. If you choose to read on, here is a breakdown of our dinner, but you may have to wait an extra week for reservations.1. Japanese Uni, Cold Egg Custard, Ponzu Jelly - 8/10. Different take on the traditional chawanmushi. Instead of a hot dish, they chilled the egg custard and enhanced it with a light ponzu flavored jelly on top. Of course the sweet, buttery and creamy uni help add the perfect final touch.2. Smoked Butter Fish, Garlic Green Sauce, Organic Radish - 10/10. Wow! Such a fantastic melding of flavors. The smokiness of the fish, which is actually Managatsuo (Pampano), blended so well with the gentle garlicky sauce. The radish added excellent contrast to the texture of the dish.3. Whiting Tempura, Turnip, Green Leaf, Yuzu Sauce - 9/10. Stepping away from traditional tempura, this colorful course chose not to use the various dipping salts or tempura sauce, instead opting for a light and refreshing yuzu sauce. Huge fan.4. King Crab, Cold Egg Custard, Turnip Espuma - 8/10. Added course to the chef's tasting. As expected, simply amazing. However, what was interesting was the foam-like Turnip Espuma stole the show by accenting the dish with an uniquely refreshing taste when it first hit your mouth. Next time I will add the Ossetra Caviar ($10) for a bit of saltiness.5. Seared Red Shrimp (from Seattle) with Ossetra Caviar - 10/10. Can't remember right now when was the last time that I had a shrimp this unbelievably awesome. Delicately cooked in order to bring out some of the delicious flavor while keeping the shrimps as tender as can be. A small touch of caviar and chives completes the perfect bite. I need a few dozens of these shrimps at all times.6. Broiled Miso Gindara (Black Cod) with Parmesan Foam - 9/10. It's often a mistake to try and change a classic dish. Miso Black Cod needs absolutely nothing, yet I cannot deny the fact that I truly enjoyed this refreshing new take on the original. It is not overpowering at all. The light Parmesan foam and broth were positively delightful paired with the exquisitely broiled Black Cod. 7. Aged Premium Angus Beef Steak - 6/10. Only small letdown of the night. Well, you know why. How is a restaurant of this caliber serving Angus beef (ribeye cut) instead of Wagyu, or at least USDA Prime? It may be cooked perfectly, but I am spoiled and I want the meat course to step up to the level of the seafood to utterly blow my mind. I brazenly raised my concerns and gave my explanation to the chef. He expressed appreciation for the constructive criticism. Now let's hope that Mifune upgrade this course. If they do, you're welcome.8. Foie Gras Egg Rice (added Black Truffles for $10) - 10/10. Get the *bleep* out of here! Holy smokes! I may have found my favorite rice dish anywhere. Okay, maybe top 5 since I am Chinese and we eat a lot of rice. First of all, the thick piece of foie gras was cooked better than most French restaurants around the city. Its rich flavors mixed into the rice kicked some serious ass. Second, the soy sauce flavored sabayon went so well with the rice that we really didn't need the truffles. If you eat at Mifune and decide to go a la carte, this is THE must order item.9. Matcha Mousse Manoka & Peach Sorbet - 8/10. I enjoyed the matcha flavored mousse tucked away inside of the manoka (wafer-like cookie), while the peach sorbet was so refreshingly good. These are not creative or ground breaking desserts, but Mifune kept the finale simple and it works as a pleasant ending to an incredible meal.Mifune is the real thing. Don't accept any substitutes. The recently opened Suzuki and Naoki both fall way short compared to this newcomer. Don't wait! Go make that reservation now while it's still relatively easy. I have a strong feeling that it won't be long before others recognize this diamond - ready to shine.",6,0,2,Gordon Y.,"Rego Park, NY",562,237,1376
