5.0,4/28/2019,"Really loved this place. The service, the food, and the decor is on point! Love that the menu and interior changes seasonally  makes the experience special every time you go!

5.0,4/28/2019,"Absolutely incredible!! The aesthetic is just captivating the staff was so thoughtful and welcoming. We said that we were celebrating so the chef comped us a special appetizers and prosecco to celebrate! I highly, highly recommend - the food was an incredible fusion of diverse and unexpected flavor.

5.0,4/28/2019,"OUTSTANDING place for dinner with a date or a small group! The ambiance is really breathtaking, and I'm told it changes to match each season. And, as you'd expect at a nice establishment like this, the service was nothing short of phenomenal.We ate at a couple of open seats adjacent to the bar area, and the bar staff made us feel like VIPs. So attentive, great about providing suggestions from the menu, and they even offered us an amuse-bouche, compliments of the chef! They really went above and beyond to make our experience here stand out.The amuse-bouche was a mushroom/risotto/lemon zest concoction that was equal parts savory and tart, and 100% delicious. We also had the city's smallest cheeseburgers, I didn't get around to taking a photo until after we inhaled the first four because they were so good. Finally, we split a bowl of blistered shishito peppers, which were also very well prepared!The highlight of the night was the dessert -- a chocolate cube (how can you say no to that?) that's exactly what it sounds like. SO GOOD. Even without all the other amazing aspects of this meal, the cube itself was worth coming here. I'll definitely be coming back!",2,0,2,Cyrus A.,"Manhattan, NY",154,138,167

4.0,4/23/2019,The inside of this restaurant is gorgeous!!! The food was all delicious and the ambiance was great. I came with a group of friends for brunch and we paid for the bottomless mimosas. This was the only downside.... the servers stopped pouring Champaign after an hour and a half. They were nowhere in sight for the last half hour of the time we PAID FOR to have drinks. Disappointing.,0,0,0,Julia M.,"Frankfurt am Main Süd, Frankfurt, Germany",0,18,19
5.0,4/22/2019,"This restaurant exceeded my expectations! The food is  incredible, along with the unbelievable service. The manager Matt was beyond accommodating to my food allergy. He came to my table multiple times to explain the ingredients of each dish to ensure my allergy needs were met. I am beyond satisfied with the service and appreciate his genuine concern for my health. Besides the incredible food, the decor is absolutely breathtaking, everything was top notch.

5.0,4/22/2019,"5 star brunch spot!  There's a solid selection of food and drinks, which changes thru the year.  Recently I got the fried chicken sandwich, which did not disappoint!  It's topped with jalapeño slaw, and for anyone worried-- it's not spicy at all.  We also had the pesto kale salad and the burratta-- both were amazing.  In addition to excellent food, the service is 1st class.  The server even brought us an extra order of circle fries to share!We plan on going back the next time we are in the city!",2,0,1,Nehal G.,"Tampa, FL",17,43,90
5.0,4/18/2019,"Wow! Right off the bat this place is beautiful! The décor and menu was during the spring season, and my friend and I opted for the $32 brunch special where we got a pasty, appetizer, and entree. Beet Pesto Salad: Sooooo flavorful! The pesto was bursting with flavor, and the beets were complemented it perfectly. This came with a side of toasted baguette, and served as a perfect savory appetizer.Burrata Salad: This salad came with a side of salad with a light citrus vinegrette and strawberries. This was my favorite dish of the day! Highly recommend it if you see it on the menu! Pineapple French Toast: This was VERY sweet. It served more as a dessert than an entre. A slice of toaste was soaked in batter and ended up tasting more like a bread pudding than a French toast. On top was a caramel-tasting sauce, and all topped with grilled pineapple. Only get if you have an extreme sweet tooth!Everything crusted Branzino: Two slices of branzino, coated with almonds with pickled onions on top and a fresh cream sauce beneath. Highly recommend this dish! The onions and sauce cut any kind of overt fishy-taste, and it was just delightful!! Fried Chicken Sandwich: A solid chicken sandwich, nothing stands out. Chicken was flavorful and juicy, and was placed between two brioche-type buns with coleslaw, which was on the drier side. Definitely will seek out this restaurant when I'm back in the area. Such a great place to hang out, have any kind of get-together, and the food is always solid and delicious. Each dish had a combination of unique flavors I have never tried before, and I felt feeling....more educated in terms of my palate! amazing!",1,0,0,Julie E.,"Edmond, OK",333,43,32
5.0,4/12/2019,"Park Avenue Restaurant is one of my favorite restaurants in NYC. Great for large parties (recently held a surprise birthday lunch for my Mom) and also for more intimate gatherings. Attentive service, good energy, spacious dining room and the food is delicious. Two course prix-fixe brunch for $32 is good value for quality. My favorite dishes include the steak tartare, black sea bass, and long island duck breast. Also, remember to save space for the cinnamon monkey rolls!",0,0,0,Eric C.,"New York, NY",138,36,17
5.0,4/11/2019,"Culinary perfection meets sublime interior design.  When I say 5 stars I mean 5 solid stars. Our server, a very polished African American man, was flat out lovely.  Food is expertly prepared down to the temperatures of the salad greens etc.  We lingered over lunch for 3 hours and savored the experience. This is easily my favorite spot in NYC. We were there the day after they converted to Spring and I was blown away. The minute I set foot in the dining room my heart skipped a beat. It felt so charming and magical. In the moment I felt like a princess in a fairy tale. Absolutely amazing top to bottom.",0,0,0,Jen M.,"Chicago, IL",574,2229,24
1.0,4/7/2019,"Really bad experience here last night.  The female Manager is totally rude and doesn't know the first thing about customer service.  This was my fourth time to the restaurant.  Every time I've been here I've done the $69 wine pairing dinner.  I chose this place last night especially for that because I was with friends that didn't have much money.  We sat down at 7:40pm and they wouldn't give us the wine pairing dinner because it apparently doesn't start until 8:30.  I got up to speak to the Manager explaining that I had been there a few times, wasn't aware that there was a particular start time and asked if she would honor it this one time.  She said only if we sat at the table and didn't order until 8:30.  At 8:30 she would give us the menu. Seriously?!?  Sit at a table for almost an hour?  She said she couldn't honor it earlier because they might run out of wine.  Dumbest excuse ever.  She wasn't nice at all during the discussion.  A complete stuck up B.  I hope she enjoys the extra $20 she got out of us for ordering off the regular menu because now I'll never go back.",0,0,0,Noelle S.,"Franklin Lakes, NJ",97,7,1

5.0,3/31/2019,"Honestly, the food was very good, but it was the decor that won me over. In hindsight I wish I took pics of it. We came for the start of their spring menu, so they'd transformed the restaurant into a woodsy atmosphere with cherry blossoms and budding vines. They were playing soulful music like The Spinners and Aretha Franklin so that was a big plus for me too. My friend mentioned that they'd played rock the last time they were there.To eat, we had the hamachi appetizer and I had the cavatelli. Everything had great presentation and they played around with some great tastes. The complimentary bread for instance, had a sweeter hint to it and it came with a creamy garlic butter & breaded mushrooms (with a hint of citrus) on the side. My friend got the oatmeal ice cream which came on graham cracker bread crumbs. Definitely a fan of its uniqueness and hoping to catch each season.",1,0,1,Niccole M.,"Somerset, NJ",165,59,188
4.0,3/30/2019,Had dinner on Friday with 8 friends. Burrata appetizer was terrific. Branzino entre was just ok. Others had snapper and salmon which were better choices. Waiter was sub par as was carrot cake dessert. Blueberry tart was well worth it.,0,0,0,Jay H.,"Yorktown Heights, NY",0,4,0
4.0,3/28/2019,"Came here to celebrate our friend 30th Birthday, as it's my first time coming to NYC! I just love everything about this place! Their beautiful decorating make me feel so enjoyed and relaxing while eating my dinner! It's a little noisy but ok! the price is not too bad for a fancy place like this! We get to be seated right away because of the reservation, there drink selection is great! I'm a sangria person so I always like to try it at every restaurant I go that have sangria in their drink menu! They messed up my order with my other friend but they fixed it right away which was nice! My steak was so juicy and our appetizer is also great, my husband really love his dishes! We didn't have dessert since we got the birthday cake as our dessert.

4.0,3/27/2019,The four stars is for the ambience. Three stars for service and two stars for the food. I came here for brunch on a Sunday. They have a prefix brunch menu for $32. You get a monkey roll for the table with icing and pecans on the side. The monkey roll was very good. The appetizer the waffle and sausage was actually better than the entree. For my entree I ordered the French toast but it was extremely soggy throughout the middle. I tried the other piece to see if it was better but it was the same. I normally don't like sending food back but I just couldn't eat it. The waiter was able to get my friend and I a different meal. We both opted for the burger with fries. The burger came on an English muffin. The burger meat tasted very fresh. The curly fries were basic. They serve unlimited rose or prosecco  for $15. The prosecco comes with juices for the table. Here is where the service comes in we were at brunch in a group to enjoy our time together. Within the first hour not once did our waiter refill our glasses and that irritated me. I've been to plenty of brunches and if your paying for unlimited the service should be as such. I will say after the hour of receiving no refill the second hour the waiter was more on top of making sure our glasses were not empty. For a special event ask to sit in the main dining room. That is where all the decorations are. The restaurant is very pretty.,1,0,0,Holly C.,"Bronx, New York, NY",0,51,130

4.0,3/8/2019,"Sizable portions of delicious food that exemplifies what New American cooking is about. While you might not find the most creative or fanciest food at Park Avenue, it's seasonal menu is intriguing and their food is delicious. I was able to come here during restaurant week in February, and tried the two course lunch. I got a hamachi appetizer which came with blood orange and roasted macademias, which was much more interesting than your typical chili-lime garnish for yellowtail. The fish was reasonably fresh. My girlfriend got the burrata, which was probably the better choice, as the rich and creamy cheese was served with thick slices of rustic toast to spread on along with a beautifully dressed slightly bitter arugula salad that ended up being my favorite dish. For the main course I tried the pork shoulder, which was tasty but lacked any kimchi flavor it was advertised with. My girlfriend got the branzino, which was nicely cooked. I personally thought my dish could have used a touch more salt. We also tried the Brussels sprouts, which turned out to be half bacon half sprouts. The bacon was good, but somewhat overbalanced the dish. The two course restaurant week lunches were a great deal with really tasty food, although the dishes were just a touch away from being truly perfect. Their menu is extensive with plenty of choices, and it's definitely a nice place to have a large party. The New York food scene is competitive, and Park Avenue serves great food but fails to be especially memorable among the multitude of amazing fine dining options even just in Manhattan. 4 stars.",0,0,0,Michael K.,"Sugar Land, TX",250,78,86
4.0,3/8/2019,"Bougie, but definitely thankful that my friends surprised me for my birthday this year by taking me to Park Avenue Autumn/Winter/Spring/Summer.  We went during the Winter season and what a lovely time.  Their service was not particularly memorable, but it also wasn't horrible.  The servers worked together to make sure our glasses were filled, and our waitress was really patient with getting all of our drink orders in (answering all questions as well, plus letting us taste a few before committing to a particular wine).  My friend's husband got the peekytoe crab which he graciously shared with us and passed around the table.  The bite I got had a good amount of crab and although it wasn't super flavorful in my mouth, it was a nice delicate first bite.  For my main, I got the peconic bay scallops which comes with curried carrots - literally tasted like farm to table - the carrots were so fresh and their sweetness shined when eaten with the salty bacon jam.  I didn't get a huge kick of mint in the dish, but it was combination.  I did wish my dish was cooked last because most of the scallops were room temperature or cold by the time I consumed them.  Definitely not cooked evenly, but the majority of scallops were not over-cooked so that is good.  If I did go back, I would definitely get the grilled pork shoulder.  Two of my friends got that dish so I was able to get a few bites and the fattier cuts of meat were DELICIOUS!  Paired with the kimchi-braised kale, which didn't have an overly-strong kimchi garlic flavor, but still slightly spicy was a nice pairing to the pork.  I don't think I would pay $36 for this dish because although I've never made kimchi braised kale, I could try and also buy some free range pork shoulder.  Regardless, I'm grateful for the memories and experience, and especially to my loving friends.",0,0,0,Hannah L.,"New York, NY",74,179,97
2.0,2/24/2019,"Where do I begin? Let me first say i was a server for 5 years so I know some things. First of all the restaurant is gorgeous. Simply beautiful. Everything else is average. Our reservation was 645. We sat down at 639. Server asked us if we wanted water. A bus boy brought us water right away. So let's start the clock at 642. No one came back to our table for 20 minutes. (The restaurant and the server's section was not busy AT ALL) Let me explain my frustration. Our server went to his other 2 tables in his section 10 times without even acknowledging us again. Without giving a courtesy ""I will be right with you"" on top of all the other servers watching us look around in confusion just ignoring us. Had we not flagged down a bus boy at 705 we would probably still be sitting there. Finally the server approaches and doesn't apologize. Now I'm not trying to make this a racial thing but the vibe was completely off. I will just leave that there. And let me also say i know the stereotypes of African Americans Asians and Indians in restaurant culture. I'm gonna leave that there too. And then let me also say me and my BFF restaurant hop. We go for broke when we go out to dinner but that shouldn't matter with how you treat us. Anyway the food. The bread and truffles they bring you to start are divine. We started with the Brussel leaves salad and pumpkin ravioli. Both were good. I had the short rib. It was too damn salty, i wanted to run it under water. But it was so tender. My friend had the duck which ironically could've used some salt. We got their Brussels and bacon which were blah. I like my Brussels to be crispy and flavored! We also got their truffle fries which were divine. The reason I loved their $25 fries was because they shaved the truffle on top instead of the way other restaurants do it drenching it in truffle oil. We skipped dessert which we never do but the service just annoyed us. I had a regift spritz drink which i loved. I'm a sucker for anything with champagne. But that's all I got. It's definitely average volume in there. I mean you can hear what every table is talking about. I'm never going again which I'm sad about because their scenery is divine. But I digress.",0,0,0,Tiffani T.,"South Orange, NJ",8,47,35
3.0,2/23/2019,"We were really big fans of Park Avenue. We went during restaurant week for Park Avenue Summer and had a wonderful experience. They happened to offer a wine dinner which we were excited to find out about, and decided it was worth it. The food was fantastic, service was great and the wine was a perfect match for the menu. We had such a great experience we decided to go back for the Park Avenue Winter wine dinner. This time we were less than impressed. The food was still great, which is why we were so bummed the rest of the experience was so bad. We splurged for the wine dinner, and when the wine should've been the highlight of our experience, it ended up being the worst part. Primarily the issue was with service. Our server brought the first wine, a Prosecco which was good, then once we were finished with that glass he proceeded to bring over a different white wine and poured it in the same glass. I didn't say anything until he brought over the third wine, a Spanish red and poured yet again in the same used glass. It tasted almost sour which is when I said something about the wine. Not only did he use the same glass, but as we continued through the pairings he would give a smaller pour each time. I asked if it was supposed to be a full glass each time or just a tasting. He said it was a full glass and tried to argue that the 3 oz he poured was a full glass, but that he could give me more if I wanted.  What's even worse, is that after the meal, the hostess asked how everything was and I told her about the terrible experience with the wine, she took my name and number and said the manager ""might"" call...what kind of answer is that. The manager never called, which is just terrible customer service, and as great as the food was, we will not be going back. The wine is supposed to be the focus of the meal and they can't even be bothered to change the glasses each time or give you what you are paying for.",0,0,0,Kassie W.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",230,4,0

Every course was to die for and it was hard even making a decision what to get. Would come here twice in the season if I wasn't in medical school (e.g. broke AF). Great pairings with cider and wine options. Only thorn in our night: The host was a little off. When we went to the host to let him know you've arrived for our resevation, he doesn't make eye contact with you or even doesn't even look up from his iPad so that when he speaks you're unsure if he's talking to you or the waiters surrounding him.

4.0,2/23/2019,"This is a review for their wine dinner (winter). For $69 pp, you get 4 wine pairings designed to pair each course (except dessert), but if you like any of the wines served you can ask for seconds, which is probably why it's branded as all-you-can-drink. The glasses are big though so I recommend 4-6 glasses maximum to prevent constant bathroom trips. The food was surprisingly good for a place that one would assume serves ""all-you-can-drink"" menu. All the dishes, from appetizer to dessert, were made with seasonal ingredients and amazingly fresh. The braised short ribs was fork-tender, and the burrata was made in-house - simple but high quality ingredients. Our service was slightly slow (dinner took 3 hours) for 4 people, but it was a bustling Friday night with a party of 15 people next to us so it was understandable.

Our waitress was so rude to us and when we asked about a side dish they forgot, they asked if we even wanted it. Of course we did, we ordered it... they brought it out AFTER we finished eating and when we asked for it to be taken off the bill, they agreed. They must've thought we were not paying attention because they TOOK NOTHING OFF and refused to give us the updated itemized receipt without the side dish we didn't want to pay for. I and a few others had taken note of the total prior to asking for the side dish to be removed so we know for certain she did not remove it from the bill. When we asked for the itemized receipt she blatantly ignored us and by this point we were the only table left in the restaurant so she definitely heard us ... it was appalling and worst of all put a total damper on our night.

4.0,2/11/2019,"I came to Park Avenue Winter for restaurant week. We made a reservation, but I was a little bummed that we were not seated in the main dining room because that's where the beautiful seasonal decorations are. The seating area we were in was extremely cramped, but we fit. The woman next to us exclaimed to her friend ""I hate this table!"" when she arrived because the corner was definitely pretty tight. But space aside, the food at Park Avenue was delicious! I had the crab cake which was full of real crab but it required +$5 supplement to the fixed price. The crab cake was delicious and the citrus on the side was a great complement to the flavor as well! I ordered the beef short rib which was extremely tender and mild in flavor. I loved the pine nuts on it which added a nice texture. We ordered a side of Brussels sprouts, which were nothing to write home about. The dessert came out and both were adorably seasonally appropriate. They were sweet, tasty, and super picturesque!",1,1,0,Amy F.,"New York, NY",201,73,115
5.0,2/10/2019,"Tl;dr: Surprisingly large portions, well-executed dishes, and certainly worth the value of a restaurant week lunch. Not a showstopper, but a reliably great meal. STARTERS: I started with the burrata dish, and was surprised by how large the portion was. The chef did a great job balancing the textures and flavors on the plate. The crispy bread, the creamy burrata, and the tender but firm persimmons which added just the right amount of sweetness to every bite. Even thought I don't normally like arugula, I ate this dish happily. Word of warning -- because of its size, this dish is extremely heavy. Order your other items accordingly lest you end up sadly eyeing the brussels sprouts that can no longer fit into your stomach. MAIN: I ordered the Branzino, a classic NYC fish with delicate white flesh. The skin of the branzino was crispy and the meat itself was tender and seasoned well. Nothing overpowered the flavor of the dish, which I appreciated. Unlike the burrata dish however, I wasn't as excited about the fruit choice for the dish. The mandarins were slightly too sweet, and would have complimented the dish better if they were more tart. Everything else was just normal. My boyfriend kindly ate most of them for me. SIDES: The miso glazed brussel sprouts caught my eye on the menu. I expected a light, sweet glaze on some roasted brussel sprouts. Instead, I got a hearty side of bacon and juicy roasted brussel sprouts. The miso flavor took much more of a backseat. On the normal menu, this is advertised as Brussels and bacon, so this should not be an issue outside of restaurant week..  Overall, I really enjoyed dining here. Excellent decor, service, and food presentation as well.",2,1,1,Horatia F.,"Houston, TX",344,24,31

Taking in the scenery, everything is quite beautifully done. For appetizers, we ordered the burrata - which was some of the best I have ever had and the caesar salad. Both beautifully prepared and very fresh. For my main dish, I had the burger, without the bun because of my celiac disease, and it was amazing!

4.0,2/7/2019,"I came here on restaurant week, so my review is based on that one experience. It was easy making a reservation on open table. When I arrived, the hostess was pretty nice and told me to wait at the bar, but she was a bit rude to another party that arrived late. Although I do understand, I think it could be said better.I was seated once my party was all here. It was a bummer that I did not get seated in the main dining room because it was so beautiful, but the area in which we were seated was nice and initiate. A great date night atmosphere.I had the pumpkin ravioli and the filet mignon, and dessert was the sticky toffee pudding. The whole meal was so delicious. There was an upcharge for the steak, but it was worth it. My friend had the prime rib and she said it was delicious as well. The service was not hovering at all, but could be hard to track down sometimes. However, we were fine with it, although our waiter was pretty absent. For restaurant week - I will definitely return. Or come back for a nice special occasion like a birthday or anniversary date. Very classy place. Perfect for date night.",0,0,0,Erina W.,"Brooklyn, NY",165,343,188
3.0,2/7/2019,"I have been wanting to try this place. So made a reservation in this restaurant week and finally tried the renowned Park Ave Winter. It was pretty packed, probably because of restaurant week. You kinda needed to talk really loudly so your company/ people from the table next to you could hear you. 42 for three courses dinner I thought was decent. Although you need to pay extra if you fancy some better fish or steak, which is pretty common. Food in general was good. We got the halibut and pork shoulder, both very delicious. For appetizer, the hamachi was extraordinary. Paid extra 5ish dollar to get the crab cake but it was just about ok. I also liked the creme brûlée. We got the latke for the table too. Not really recommended.. McDonald's has better hash browns...Service was bad. Lol and it's the main reason I didn't give a 4 star. Our waiter didn't really pay much attention to us and ignored our little requests. I also heard the lady next to us complained that she requested a medium well steak but it was too raw.",0,0,0,Lia L.,"New York, NY",1,16,11

Besides being a stunning venue, the food is exceptional regardless of if you come for brunch or dinner. They also do an unlimited option with brunch, which is 100% worth it.

I had the pumpkin ravioli which had a lot of flavor but also a bit on the oily side. I had the short rib sandwich and it was a pleasant surprise because it's an open sandwich with a lot of short ribs and side salad.

4.0,1/29/2019,"Came here for RW - one of the few RW meals I've had that actually has me committed to returning. Get the crab cake and halibut!Apps - Steak tartare and the crab cake were the best. Seriously good crab cake, possibly the best crab cake I've ever had (I know, bold statement, but it was reeeeally good). Came with a thin crust of rye on top that added the perfect crunch texture to it. Everyone loved it.Burrata was average, hamachi crudo was ok. Mains - Thought the halibut was fantastic. Delicate with notes of truffle. Granted I like anything truffle but it was well executed. Short ribs were good too, but not as good as the halibut. Branzino was ok but kinda forgettable although I'm personally just not into that fish. Sides- fries were ok, brussel sprouts were surprisingly not good and that dish needs to be reworked, latkes ok. Sides overall did nothing much for me. Decor - place looks great, tree design in the middle was striking. Service - pretty good minus a long break between entree and dessert. Actually forgot about desserts as nothing special. I'll definitely want to re eat that crab cake and halibut sometime soon.",1,0,1,Jonathan L.,"Yorkville, Manhattan, NY",106,155,48

The avocado toast ($5 supplement), squash soup and burrata were all very goodThe chicken sandwich (must be known for this dish.

3.0,1/25/2019,"In-salting. Pun intended. ----My boyfriend and I came to Park Avenue Winter tonight for a 3-course restaurant week dinner.Pros: beautiful restaurant, lovely presentation.Cons: food was overly salty, hospitality and service were underwhelming. What we ordered: 1. Appetizers: Hamachi crudo, Pumpkin ravioli 2. Mains: Black truffle Halibut, Filet mignon, truffle parmesan fries to share 3. Dessert: sticky toffee pudding, horchata ice cream4. White wine and a cocktail We were seated in a smaller room that didn't have the beautiful decor of the main restaurant area. Much of the food had excessive amounts of salt and some of it arrived warm at best. Worst of all, our server kept going to other larger tables to check in on them while we had to politely wave to him to get his attention multiple times, which didn't work. He simply turned his back to the smaller tables.We finally got the busser's attention who got a hold of our waiter, who didn't even apologize for neglecting our table. The food was good, but with no standouts in my opinion. Presentation was well executed and looked better than it tasted. Unfortunately, I don't think we'll be coming back. My suggestion: take your money elsewhere. Even on restaurant week.Also, at some point the music turned to club music, at 6:30pm in an upscale restaurant, it was bizarre.",0,0,0,Daisy W.,"Manhattan, NY",159,72,23

5.0,1/20/2019,"Came to Park Avenue Winter to celebrate a birthday brunch with a small group of friends. We made a reservation far in advance as I heard it gets booked fast! First, the decor is absolutely stunning - it felt like a woodsy winter wonderland with gorgeous lights and decor. For brunch, they offer a pre fix menu which includes a bakery item, appetizer, and entree. We also opted for the bottomless brunch option which includes unlimited prosecco or rose with spiced pear, grapefruit rosemary, and blood orange mixers. We started with cinnamon monkey rolls which were quite delicious. We then tried the local burrata, whipped yogurt and pineapple compote, and the brunch risotto. If you want something lighter I would opt for the burrata or yogurt compote, but all were delicious. For mains we got the breakfast poutine, crusted branzino, crispy chicken sandwich, and smoked salmon eggs benedict. The poutine was a little too salty for me. The branzino and benedict were both good lighter options. Our waiter was very attentive, making sure our glasses stayed full throughout the meal! He also overheard us talking about our birthdays and was thoughtful enough to have desserts with candles brought over to celebrate. Overall, this was definitely a 5 star experience for us.

4.0,1/10/2019,"Review for Winter 2018: 3.5/5 overallFood: 3.5/5Ambiance: 4/5Service: 4/5Value: 3.5/5Dinner was a bit of a roller coaster. Started high with some great appetizers, followed by rather unimpressive entrees, and finishing on a higher note with better desserts. I'd recommend the burrata and crab cakes for appetizers. The filet mignon was the best ""entree"" choice, clearly better than the grilled pork shoulder. I was disappointed by the Branzino partially because the description was misleading (all those ingredients listed are just bits and pieces in the huge portion of couscous) and I've had better branzino. The latkes and brussels are fine as side dishes. Finish with the chocolate cube (highly recommend for chocolate lovers, and it's just really cool to open), or apple crostata for a larger group (this could probably feed 4-6 ppl). The broken holiday ornament had a beautiful presentation, but I didn't love the mousse texture. The creme brulee was not creamy and dreamy as it could've been. We came here for last min plans for a large group, but the large circular tables are not the most comfortable to talk across in a moderately loud dining room, and our chairs kept getting bumped. I'd like to think this wasn't the best rendition of the menu, and while it is beautiful inside the meal was disappointing. I would not recommend for groups bigger than 5.",2,0,1,Lillian Y.,"Brooklyn, NY",461,285,1300
4.0,1/6/2019,"We weren't sure where to go for Christmas dinner but were recommended this restaurant because of its seasonal themes. I will say these themes are pretty toned down so honestly I didnt feel like I was in a restaurant that was had a winter theme. All good though we were sat at a wobbly table in the back room.They had a prixe fix menu for Christmas which was $89 for appetizer, entree, dessert, and sides. I thought everything was pretty delicious.  Honestly, I was pretty skeptical considering prixe fix menus are generally pretty average. This wasnt the case here. The crabcake appetizer was delicious and it had some avocado crema that was a great compliment. As for my entree I ordered the Halibut which was flaky and just the right amount of seasoning. The sides come in one long plate with a little of everything. I didnt focus on the sides too much honestly but the stuffing was pretty good. For dessert I ordered the sticky toffee pudding. This was probably my least favorite part of the meal. The dessert did have good flavor but the savior was the ice cream on top. It added the right sweetness and contrast in flavors to make it work.The service was also good and the place accomodated us well and was comfortable.

It was paired with grapefruit and avocado- but I do have to say it was very different than any other crab cake I've ever had. I got the pomegranate short ribs for an entree and it was unbelievable! The Pom was such a nice touch and I wish they even had more seeds on there. One friend got the salmon which was mediocre and the other got crab risotto for an extra $8. The risotto was tasteless and the dish was really not that great- not worth the extra $$. For dessert, I'd go with the ice creams. Overall good experience and obviously a great deal.

About 30 min later our main course arrived, mine a very charred French toast (did not realize one could screw up French toast). At this time we asked for the check and found that they comped the 7 bottomless drinks because we had said something to management but this was not exactly beneficial to the 5 people who weren't drinking.

The portions were decent and they chose a great selection of their delicious dishes. Well worth it when you are a struggling student who wants to eat fancy for a day. I do recommend bringing buddies with you to enjoy and share multiple dishes with. I brought 2 other friends and we were able to try a majority of the items on the restaurant week menu!

The food was so so good. The wine was great too. Our waitress was sweet, however upon leaving we asked a lady who worked there (not our waitress)  to take a picture of all 4 of us and she tells her co-worker ""what am I a photographer?""

At one point they served us broccoli with cheddar and HOT CHEETOS. Gross!!! It was not something any self respecting high-end restaurant would serve and even if they presented it better (which they could have) the flavors were so disgusting.The only edible thing from my end was the crab and avocado toast.

I went for the autumn season $32 Prix-fixe, which includes the PARK AVENUE WARM CINNAMON MONKEY ROLLS, which is always good (with Rum Raisins, Cream Cheese Frosting, Candied Pecans).I had the PUMPKIN RAVIOLI for an appetizer, which was a really good blend of flavors that I'm not normally a fan of: pumpkin, hazelnut, pesto. But it really came together, with the highlight being the Pickled Cranberries.Then I finished with the WILD HUCKLEBERRY GRIDDLECAKES. It seemed like ordinary pancakes, but the Vermont Maple Syrup made it good. It had a smoky flavor.I don't drink, but my companion had the Blend Your Own Bellini Bar. I tried some of the juices that came with it, and they were great by themselves. The best was the apricot, which tasted like peach. They also had Spiced Pear and Pomegranate & Fig. The pear was pretty good, considering the fact that I don't like pear.The decor was nice as usual, and I liked how the waiters wore red and black flannel shirts to go with the autumn theme.

5.0,10/27/2018,"We've come to Spring and summer and now autumn for our anniversary. Spring was definitely my favorite decor but autumn was my favorite menu. I highly recommend the Wine Dinner (after 8:30 pm and all night Sunday), which includes unlimited wine tastings on 4 different wines, an appetizer, an entree, and dessert for $65 per person. There was a wait for our reservation so they handed out complimentary Prosecco. Each meal comes with an amuse bouche. For appetizers, between the autumn haystack and squash + ricotta, I thought the shrimp with the cabbage salad complemented each other well but too much cabbage for the amount of shrimp and the squash and ricotta had a perfect amount with a combination of sweet and creamy. I got the halibut, which I really enjoyed and had a miso soup tasting sauce with crispy scallions. The outside of the halibut was perfectly crisp but the inside was soft and buttery. They gave us a side Brussels sprouts, an ice cream Sunday, and champagne for our anniversary which was wonderful. I also had the pumpkin dome, which was divine and sweeter than the Mexican creme brûlée. I would recommend if you have a sweeter tooth and enjoy chocolate a lot.

(Not a good sign) A long story short, the service was awful, un-attentive, in-correct and not what you'd expect for an $850 meal. After several wrong drink orders, and a delayed ordering process, it's just not what the price point, location or reputation is known for.

5.0,10/21/2018,"I've been here 3 times now for brunch during Spring, Summer and Autumn and I always have a great experience! I was so drawn to this place just because I knew they did the menu and decor change with each season, which I think is very innovative and fun. I most recently came for brunch during Autumn and I definitely think it was my favorite ambience.The brunch menu is great - $32 price fixe for a pastry, appetizer and entree. Definitely a bang for your buck. Add $15 for unlimited champagne to blend with the 3 bellini flavors of the season, and trust me, the waiters don't even wait until your glass is half empty to come back and top you off.For Autumn, I went with the butternut squash soup which was probably the best butternut squash soup I've had. It's perfect for a chilly day. In the past I'd tried the crab and avocado toasts for my app, and that was really good too but definitely more filling than the soup for an app. I'd also always gotten the salmon eggs benedict as my main since it was really good, but I switched it up to the huckleberry griddlecakes this time. The cakes are fluffy and stuffed with the berries, and the syrup was so so good. Definitely enjoyed it!Highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a nice brunch.

This is not your typical pre fixe menu with limited choices and lackluster food quality. The quality of every dish is incredible, the food is colorful on your plate, and I can tell the ingredients used in each dish are of high quality. I like to come here for holidays or anniversaries. Even when I've come in groups and tried everyone else's dish too, we all agreed that the food was delicious. Plus, the 4 wine choices presented throughout the night is an awesome addition!The only slight cons:-The decorations inside are not as striking as you would expect given the Winter/Spring/Summer/Autumn changing themes. It seems to be twinkle lights of some fashion but not much variation to distinguish which season is currently on display.-It can get loud given the proximity of tables to each other.

The creativity of the theme and deliciousness of the food.  They brought out appetizers that looked like small mushrooms stuck on  minilogs.  The ""mushrooms"" were shaped apples that had sprinkled on top carmelized sage on breadcrumbs.

2.0,9/30/2018,"Beautiful, spacious, wonderful service but lousy, disappointing brunch food at our table. The 'appetizer' waffle, according to one diner, tasted as if it had come out of the freezer. The risotto was tasty and the yogurt dish also received decent, passable reviews. The 'mains', however, were all reported as sub-par, especially for a prix fixe of over $30 a head. Wild huckleberry pancakes were lacking berries; a few berries did litter the plates. We debated if the berries were legit huckleberries, but never really determined. Two diners didn't find any berries in their cakes until they reached the bottom of the stack. The burger was fair, sloppy to eat, and the fries WAY over salted. The Haystack Salad was a flavorless pile of slaw, a few pomegranate seeds, and a handful of fried shrimp right out of the freezer bag on the perimeter. To top off this whole sad scene, the coffee was bland and lukewarm.",0,0,0,Jeff M.,"Port Washington, NY",2,10,0

I love everything fall, so this sounded like a plan. Reservations for the wine dinner started at 8:30. We had an 8:45 Rez and my daughter anted to sit in the larger dining room with the tree. At 9:05 I asked to just be seated in the other room. The rooms are decorated for the season and are really beautiful. Matt, one of the managers I think, sat us promptly and even brought us over some goat cheese stuffed figs to start. They complemented the delicious pumpkin bread served with apples scooped with safe dust all held together with a little caramel and inventively presented on a log. The dinner was $65 and came with an appetizer, entree, dessert, and endless wine! We ordered the squash soup which was delicious, the shrimp app, and the corn agnolotti. The soup and corn pasta were the winners. Really outstanding. We had prosecco, a really good Sauvignon blanc, some red wine and it just kept getting better. The meal was the least interesting part of the evening. Branzino and halibut were very good. My husband ordered the pork cutlet from the classics menu and a side order of amazing latkes.

4.0,9/11/2018,"I came here for a team dinner with co-workers and we had the Mural Room all to ourselves. The interior is a beautiful sight with the dining room boasting golden chandeliers, candles, wood tables, and red booth seating all in an elegant and romantic setting. The Mural Room was filled with natural lighting from the large windows, with a yellow and white color scheme. There was a lovely, classy atomsphere. We were standing around mingling for the first hour or so, and servers came by to take drink orders and pass around hors d'oeuvres. Since I don't drink, I asked for a virgin cocktail and they gave me something fruity and refreshing with strawberry taste. The passed hors d'oeuvres were adorable - I really liked the open faced mini cheeseburger. It was super tiny, perfect bite sized with the meat being nicely tender and the cheese melted just right. I also liked the mini summer rolls which were very light and slightly crunchy.Upon being seated, we were served this amazing cornbread shaped like a shell, with delightful maple butter. The cornbread was so tender and moist, with great flavor and the butter was such a yummy touch. We also got to try all of the appetizers from the Summer Restaurant Week menu. I enjoyed the local burrata with grilled peaches and tomato. The melted mozzerella was a lovely consistency and went well with all the ingredients, especially the grilled rustic bread. The market salad consisted of peaches, summer vegetables, such as cucumber, onion, orange peppers, tomatoes, carrots and lemon vinaigrette. All the veggies were extremely fresh and had a satisfying cruch to it.For the entree, I selected the filet mignon, which was absolutely delicious! It had charred corn, chimichurri and romesco sauce with almomds that was laid underneath the steak. My steak was cooked medium well, exactly the way I asked for. The outer part was slightly charred which is how I like it and the inner part had just a tinge of pink, making it extremely tender. The meat was so incredibly juicy, succulent, flavorful - So much that it didn't even need the sauce that accompanied it. I was given 2 desserts. The Blueberry Ricotta Creme Brulee and the one I actually ordered, Chocolate Covered Strawberry. I tried a bit of the creme brule and saved the rest for later. It was quite good but I preferred the Chocolate Covered Strawberry, which was made out of strawberry chocolate mousse, pistachio cake and cocoa nib crumb crust. The outer part was bright red with white seeds and underneath was the chocolate mousse, with the pisatchio cake and cookie crumble below that. Everything mingled together to create this masterpiece of sweet treat. It was delectable! The chocolate was rich with deep chocolate taste, velvety smooth then the pistachio part was a bit too saccharine but the cookie crumble balanced it all out.The service was solid throughout our time here. The waiters were competent, working quickly and efficiently, making sure we all received what we needed. I would definitely return to try the new menu for the other seasons.",10,8,10,Kathy X.,"Queens, NY",783,438,5876

I came for a farewell dinner for a friend during the summer, and it was the perfect spot for the bittersweet occasion.Staff was attentive and provided fantastic recommendations throughout the night. Our meal started off with complimentary cornbread madeleines and fresh watermelon cubes. The warm and sweet cornbread paired with the savory chipotle maple butter was a match made in heaven - I easily could have eaten just those for dinner and would have been satisfied!For appetizers we shared the sweet corn agnolotti (small portion), yellowfin tuna & avocado, and the local burrata. The pasta was easily my favorite, though the tuna was also a tasty and refreshing starter. For my entree I had the recommended Nova Scotia halibut, and although quite petite when compared to my friend's Heritage Pork Chop next to me (which was also a delicious dish!), the fish was cooked wonderfully - flaky, moist, and full of flavor.We were too full by the end of the meal to order dessert, but judging on what was coming out for other tables, this is worth trying out next time!

The butter was an interesting flavor..some kind of spice.And the watermelon had some kind of sauce on top which didn't go well. Honestly didn't like the combination.... looks like it was just thrown together. I would rather have just a plain watermelon.For appetizer we ordered the octopus which was delicious.and for entrees:-Braised short rib (my bf ordered this and I had a bite of this...not bad, just wish more veggies came with it)-Pork chop (well cooked and I liked the seasoning on top).

4.0,8/14/2018,"Went here for restaurant week for the second time. Overall this was a really good experience. I would say my least favorite thing about this experience was the service, but I'd rather just comment on the food. I shared a few dishes so I was able to try more than 3:Corn gnocchi: Wow. Definitely order this. One of the best things I've had. Gnocchi was perfectly pillowy, corn was a lovely compliment, freshly shaved black truffle was a nice touch and added a texture that complimented the delicate gnocchi. Branzino: Delicious. Perfectly cooked. The saltiness of the olives and fregola underneath were a nice balance to the taste of the fish. I would order this again. Pork: Eh. I was excited about this but was disappointed. With a piece of pork that thick, I think it's hard to get right. It was dry and hard to get through. The flavors on this dish were okay--the corn grits were pretty good--but other than the pork being prepared differently I would have liked something acid-forward to round it out. I think that's what was trying to be done with the mustard on the plate but there wasn't enough and it was more sweet than it was acidic. Blueberry Ricotta Creme Brûlée: Very rich and delicious. This is not light like the Creme Brûlée you know--this is a heavy ricotta filling with blueberries at the bottom covered in a crispy sugar-flamed coating. I loved this dessert but could not finish it! Could have done with more fruit and no cookie.My friend got the steak tartar for an appetizer and liked it a lot. She mentioned it was a really good portion and we both liked the presentation on a long slate. I also had a bite of the key lime pie tart and this seemed like a solid dessert!PS Corey Booker and Gayle King were there tonight so if you're on the fence about going, remember it was good enough for our Senator and Oprah's best friend :)",1,0,1,Amanda C.,"Kailua-Kona, HI",4,70,24

5.0,8/12/2018,"This place was such a special treat. As other reviewers have prob mentioned, they change the entire decor, menu, etc. every season as well as the name of the restaurant. Everything was outstanding. The service, the ambience, the prosecco bellini bar, and of course the food.We came for brunch and despite being late about 20 minutes due to traffic, they were super accommodating about seating us. We all got the pre-fixe brunch for $32 which comes with their delicious monkeybread, an appetizer and entree. We also all did the bottomless build your own Bellini bar for an additional $15. The Bellini bar was fantastic. We had fresh mango, peach, and pomegranate juices. The only drawback was that even tho when freshly poured the prosecco was extremely tasty, a few times when they came around with bottles that had been opened, they were quite flat which was a little surprising.For my appetizer, I had the yellowfin tuna tartare and avocado. It was excellent. Another friend had the Belgian waffle and sausage which she seemed to really like.Two friends had the eggs Benedict and salmon and I swear those were the most delicious looking poached eggs I may have ever seen.

4.0,8/10/2018,"Thank you Restaurant Week, or as I call you, Bougie on a Budget. I get to enjoy a fine-dining experience minus the triple-digit prices.Our waiter started us off with cute watermelon skewers (nice sweet watermelon, not-so-nice dollop of savory cream on top) and cornbread madeleines with maple butter (wonderful). Then I got the following:Steak tartare with smoked razor clams and black garlic - Black garlic is so good. I feel like it's shot up in popularity over the last few years. Keep it up, everyone. This was a pretty hefty appetizer, with two bigger toast points loaded with meat. I wish the bread had been less firm and chewy, and the razor clam bits were barely there, but otherwise I really liked this.Filet mignon with charred corn chimichurri and Marcona romesco sauce - The filet mignon was juicy and tender, but not worth the $8 supplement. Then again, I think most steaks taste similar as long as they're a perfectly cooked medium as requested. The dish could've used more corn, but the tangy, thick, roasted red pepper and tomato sauce with Marcona almonds was really delicious and flavorful. It was actually my favorite part of the dish.Blueberry ricotta creme brulee with summer peaches and an almond cookie - The ricotta gave this dessert a slightly grainier, different texture and taste that I liked. The top was only very lightly bruleed for a toasted crispiness at parts without an entire hardened layer of sugar. By this point I was stuffed, and it was very rich, so I could only have a few bites before packing away the rest.Ordering the corn creme brulee side was overkill but totally worth it. The creamy corn beneath the hard sugary layer was so velvety and delicious. I thought the top part was simultaneously too sweet and salty, so I pushed it aside after a while to focus on the rest.I also got the Lovin' Spoonful cocktail with Makers Mark, peach tea, heirloom tomatoes (just a cherry tomato on the cocktail pick), and blackberry cubes. It was a little strong and medicinal-tasting for me, but it got better with time, I'm guessing from the ice cubes that diluted the drink with a sweeter berry flavor.Overall nothing was incredibly memorable, but it was still a lovely dinner with really good food.

4.0,8/9/2018,"It's that time of the year again when the stars align and Restaurant Week falls conveniently on my birthday! To celebrate I decided to come to Park Avenue for lunch to eat and drink with my family. This place had been a place on my list for some time so I was glad to be able to finally check it out. We were seated in the main dining room area which was lively and adorned with an array of trees and flowers. To start they brought out cornbread for the table which were in the shape of seashells. These were so cute! For my appetizer, I opted for the corn gnocchi. The gnocchi were cooked perfectly, and each bite was as soft as a pillow. I loved how the waiter brought out and shaved a huge black truffle on top of the dish as well. I found that the added truffle shavings really enhanced the dish. The creamy corn sauce it came in was incredible and tied all the flavors together.  For my entree, I ordered the salmon with cucumber, avocado, and crispy taro. The salmon was cooked to the perfect consistency so it was soft and flaky. I personally would have preferred a little less salt for this dish but otherwise it was delicious. Dessert is not usually included in the Restaurant Week menu but they were kind enough to bring out a carrot cake dessert with a candle for us. This was such a treat and the perfect way to end our meal. Overall we had a great time and appreciated the friendly service that was provided to our group.

4.0,8/8/2018,"I find that most of these places are incredibly overrated, so I was nicely surprised when I -loved- Park Avenue Winter. Every Sunday they do this wine pairing where you get an appetizer, entree, dessert, and like 6 wines for a set price, really good deal, pretty much like a restaurant week every Sunday. My date got the tartare and I got the butternut squash ravioli so that we could split, and both were amazing. The sauce with the raviolis was perfection and the portions are generous for appetizer. I got the steak for dinner and he got the lamb, which he said was the best lamb he's had in a while. Dessert was good but I can't remember what it was, so obviously nothing crazy. The atmosphere is very date-y, I wouldn't go here for a work meal or anything. Overall amazing food and experience, would definitely go back to try the other seasons. My only complaint would be, I wish you could pick which wines you got when. They start with champagne, which I don't generally like to start with, and then I think certain whites/reds would have paired better with my meal in different order based on what I was eating (meat, dessert, etc) but they came out in a set order based on the menu.

4.0,8/7/2018,"This is a great restaurant with trendy decor and a changing seasonal menu. We were 6 women coming on a Thurs. for RW at 730. We were seated promptly, service was attentive, helpful and polite. The RW menu was pretty generous and with good option. This was for ""Summer."" I also came for the lunch RW menu a few days later, of which I needed no reservation at 2:30.We shared two bottles of wine - a good rose and red. I had the peekytoe crab toast which our waiter said was light and small and it was definitely not small, it was actually pretty heavy. It was nice though. Maybe a bit too saucy or just had a lot of avocado in it. Which isn't bad but I like when the peekytoe crab toast shines through in big chunks. Others had among the tuna tartare, to the corn gnocchi (really good but creamy and heavy), to the local burrata (always so good).  Yum. Think the gnocchi might be the best appetizer. Flavorful. As far as the entrees, I had the filet mignon (twice actually - the second time when I came for lunch, ha), medium rare. It is a good cut of meat, well seasoned and tasty. Came over some kind of red pepper chimichuri. For dessert, I got the blueberry seasonal ice cream which was a nice refreshing scoop. Others got a huge creme bruelee (big portion for one), chocolate strawberry dome sweet and/or lemon tart. The sorbet was coconut lime which also sounded good. I wanted something light for dessert. The service was good -  waiter was attentive, informative with wine and water refills. He did recommend I tried the halibut for dinner instead of the filet and perhaps he had a point since halibut is usually never on menus for discounted pre fixes. So if I ever come back during ""Summer"", I'd definitely check that out. Happy to be back in another season here.

2.0,8/3/2018,"I made a reservation for a large party for Restaurant Week dinner. I had done extensive research when looking into which restaurant to choose, and settled on Park Avenue with high expectations. They were one of the few Restaurant Week participants with no maximum party size, and were very gracious when I called to adjust the number of attending guests.The atmosphere at this restaurant was absolutely stunning. The decor was unique and the lighting dim and intimate; you really have to see for yourself how beautiful Park Avenue Summer is. The main parlor has a beautiful high ceiling which gives the room a sense of consequence. Upon walking in, a staff member immediately offered to take our bags and umbrellas, and were very understanding when one of our guests did not show up last minute.The table offered to our party (10+) was quite crowded; I was surprised they wanted to cram us into one circular table. The waiter was pleasant, though not outstanding -- understandable with the rush from Restaurant Week.We were served cornbread with mango chipotle butter, as well as watermelon hors-d'oeuvres. The cornbread was soft and went well with the butter. Though the mango chipotle flavor did not come through too strongly, the butter was rich and of high quality. The watermelon was somewhat warm; combined with the strange cream (mayonnaise?) sauce on top; the result was a somewhat strange combination that did not sit well on the palate.I ordered: corn gnocchi, filet mignon, blueberry ricotta creme brulee.The corn gnocchi was good, but not great. The sauce had the right level of truffle flavor, and the creaminess was not overwhelming. However, I felt that the gnocchi lacked the pillowiness and softness of gnocchi I've had at cheaper Italian restaurants. Moreover, there were only 7 or 8 pieces of gnocchi -- the rest of the plate was filled with corn. It felt evident to me that the corn was there as a cheaper ""filler""; it didn't really add much to the flavor of the dish. Moreover, the texture of the kernels distracted from what should have been soft and smooth gnocchi. To be fair, Restaurant Week is Restaurant Week -- you will expect restaurants to list dishes that are of lower cost for them to make, since the meals are inherently at a discount --  but I felt as though there must have been some better substitute for the corn (or even better, no corn and more gnocchi).The filet mignon was a perfect medium rare, and very tender. However, it lacked a sear entirely; the result was a mouthful of very soft meat with no rich crust to give it smokiness or texture. Because the filet itself was underwhelming, it really needed an excellent sauce/garnish to carry the flavor and texture. Though the romesco sauce and corn chimichurri were fairly good by themselves, they could not compensate for a filet that lacked flavor and texture -- both were too bland and soft to add interest to an uninterestingly cooked hunk of meat.The worst course of the day, and possibly the worst dessert I have ever had in my life, was the blueberry ricotta creme brulee. I have a soft spot for creme brulee -- it's one of my favorite desserts -- but this was legitimately the only creme brulee I have given up on eating after a single bite. What should have been rich, creamy smoothness was curdled, gritty, flavorless custard, like pure ricotta cheese but somehow even worse. This texture was absolutely nauseating; I've never had anything quite like it, and hope I never will. The blueberry flavoring seemed to have separated from the custard, and sat in a thin watery layer at the bottom of the custard like in separated yogurt. After one bite, I had to ask the waiter to remove the dish because looking at the way the blueberry water sat at the bottom of the ramekin was legitimately making me angry. I've had ricotta cheese before, and generally like it -- I just cannot believe how bad this creme brulee was. I'm getting worked up right now just writing about it.In all fairness, we had a large party, and it is Restaurant Week -- minor slips in quality of food both offered and served are to be expected of any restaurant -- but I walked away feeling somewhat cheated of my $63.80. Perhaps this is due to my own high expectations, since I had looked forward to coming here after literal hours of research; perhaps this is due to the fact that, as the organizer of this dinner, watching some of my friends look visibly disappointed by their dishes reflected badly on me as a host. Still, I can't recommend this place for Restaurant Week. There are better places to go; if you have a large party, split it up into smaller tables and book separate reservations. Maybe things will change after August 18th, but for now, pass on this restaurant. Your wallet will thank you.",0,1,0,Jane P.,"Medfield, MA",0,2,0

It's a savory sweet - so delicious!), burrata (this was a pretty big starter dish), branzino (my friend wasn't a big fan of the fregula), summer gazpacho (very refreshing but also spicy! so those who cannot even handle a bit of spice, I wouldn't recommend it), pork loin (ohmygod, this was such a big chunk of meat, it was hard to cut at the end but I have to say, was cooked well and tasted great! not dry in my opinion), and the corn gnocchi (which was good - I had a little taste of it).

The quality and taste of the food was impeccable, definitely worth the price, and the staff was accommodating and gracious despite the large group of uncouth college kids (""Do I take the fork on my left or right??"" ""How do you pronounce gnocchi??"" -me).To start, the waiters bring out cornbread with chipotle maple butter and watermelon cubes on a stick. I loved the chipotle maple butter, which has a subtle smoky undertone. The watermelon cubes were topped with a dab of some white cream/sauce that tasted like mayonnaise, but whatever it was, it was a strange pairing. For the appetizer, I had the corn gnocchi (pronounced nyoh-kee apparently), which was creamy and dense. I am not a huge fan of gnocchi, which is too doughy and thick for my taste, but the flavor of the sauce was rich and yummy. For the main, I had the heritage pork loin and it was AMAZING. After just one bite, I realized that many of the pork loins I've previously had were overcooked. This one was cooked to perfection so that the inside was tender and creamy and the outside was crisp. The sauce and peaches complemented the pork to complete an exquisitely prepared dish.For dessert, I had the chocolate strawberry dome, which is made of a strawberry flavored jello-like outside and chocolate cream and real strawberry pieces on the inside. The jello and chocolate cream together result in an artificial, cheap taste and I wish that they used melted chocolate instead of cream. However, overall, it was still a cute and yummy dessert.

We started with the pumpkin ravioli and burrata. The ravioli had the most amazing sauce and the hazelnuts were perfect. The burrata was so creamy and perfect. We then had the filet mignon, which was perfectly cooked medium rare and the sauce that came with it complimented the steak perfectly. The only down side was that the portion size was small for the price (about 6oz). We then had the branzino and it was cooked perfectly but I would have liked a sauce to go with it. Lastly, we had the potato latkes which were amazing. They were crunch on the outside and soft on the inside and the sauces on the side went well. We would definitely come.I came here again for restaurant week and it was amazing.

We were asked to order our food within seconds of getting our menu and were told we only had 3 minutes to decide on what we wanted with no explanation of anything on the menu.

For starters we got the gnocchi and the tuna tartare. The gnocchi was phenomenal! It was cooked perfectly and paired well with the sauce. The tuna was fresh and seasoned well though much of the flavor was lost to the guacamole underneath it. For entrées, we ordered the pork loin and the filet mignon (+$8). First off their pork and steak were cooked to perfection. They both had a great crust that added so much more flavor to the meat. The pork loin was paired with grilled peaches which really enhanced the flavor of the sauce and pork, while the filet came with some charred corn chimichurri (delicious) and marcona romesco (sauce made of almonds and peppers). I wasn't informed that the sauce (there was a whole lot of it) had almonds in it as I am slightly allergic.

He comes over, reiterates what the host said.I say ""We can't even put our feet on the floor! We ALSO have a reservation.""He just didn't give a shit.

They were able to provide me with vegan options that were delicious- very fresh salad and yummy summer squash ratatouille with vegan aioli. They even make their own housemade salted caramel cacoa nib vegan ice cream. Yay! The server was extremely knowledgeable about dietary restrictions all the way down to whether the salad dressing had honey, without me even to ask. They are also great with gluten free options. If you have dietary restrictions you just have to ask and they can accommodate! FYI- I came during SUMMER season.The service was great.

4.0,7/22/2018,"I came here earlier today for brunch. The restaurant is cozy and beautiful with seasonal decor that gets changed every few months. The staff at Park Ave was very welcoming and pleasant. The brunch menu is $32 and includes a pasty, appetizer and entree. The only pastry option that we received was the cinnamon monkey bread and it was served warm, not too sweet, fresh, and delicious. There were plenty of appetizer and main dishes to choose from. For my appetizer, I ordered the tuna tartare and also tried the corn gnocchi. The tuna tartare was great and full of flavor. The gnocchi was a little less flavorful compared to the tartare but even though I didn't enjoy the gnocchi as much, I could tell that it was made with fresh ingredients. The main dish that I ordered was the salmon eggs benedict. Eggs benedict pairs perfectly with brunch and although it is a simple dish, it did not disappoint with a mix of flavors. You can also add bottomless drinks to your meal for $15. I tried the black cherry bellini which was $9 as well as the mango and they were perfectly blended and delicious.",0,0,0,Arrisa M.,"Newark, NJ",60,5,3

Of course, I figured the food was not going to be too good and the wine would be crappy, but I was so wrong!They actually give you pretty decent wine, and they aren't cheap about refilling your glass when it gets half empty! Also, the food was spectacular! It was better than Marea and Jean Georges!  I tried every amplifier and the corn pasta was something magical! HIGHLY RECOMMEND! The burrata was also fantastic!The cornbread here was probably the best cornbread I've ever had-we even asked for seconds! For my main, I got the branzino.

5.0,6/29/2018,"I came here for NYC Restaurant Week and am finally getting around to giving this place it's well deserved 5 star review. The biggest factor of this restaurant is the ever changing menu and decor (both outdoor and indoor) that happens with each season. They do a great job of styling the restaurant with the current season, pairing it with a menu full of dishes you would want in the winter or summer. As for the food itself, I can say with confidence that it is all cooked amazingly and with fresh ingredients. The staff are very professional and friendly to their customers; my waiter definitely was.

5.0,6/28/2018,"I've wanted to come here for a while but after hearing about Park Avenue's wine dinner I felt compelled to make a reservation. Admittedly I was skeptical. $65 for multiple courses and unlimited pourings of wine seemed too good to be true! However, it exceeded all of my expectations!My visit fell in the first week of their Summer season. The restaurant was packed and buzzing. Everything looked beautiful. They do a great job bringing the season to life! For those who don't know, the wine dinner is only offered from 8:30 and on. We arrived a few minutes before our 9pm reservation and were seated promptly. Our waitress clearly had a lot going on, but she was still really attentive and friendly. She explained the menu to us and told us how the wine dinner works. Not only are you offered 4 wines to try throughout your meal, but they encourage you to go back and have more of one if you particularly like it. The menu had a lot of options. Everything sounded so good that it was hard to choose! My fiancé and I chose six different plates and everything turned out delicious.

5.0,6/9/2018,"Park Ave is unique because the location changes with the seasons. Not just the menu, but also the interior is redone every three months to reflect the current time of year. I went in during a summer period, and the interior was light and tasteful with excellent and attentive service. I would definitely want to come back to see how they redo the spot for other reasons as well.Truffle waffle fries: the name says it all. This has to be the most decadent and luxurious fries I've ever had. The small crevaces in the waffle fries captures the shaved truffles to melt like butter in your mouth.Tuna and avocado: The tuna is marinated in some sort of sweet sauce, but you can still taste how fresh it is through it. This is then well balanced by the creamy neutral avocado base. Amazing appetizer.Filet mignon: The steak was a rather thick, juicy cut. Cooked to rare in the inside, it was juicy without any bleeding and accompanied with a delicate sauce that didn't stand in the way if the primeness of the meat.Duck: the marinade was just a little sweet and paired excellently with the fatty meat. Cooked tenderly but thoroughly, the duck didn't feel fatty at all.Branzino: my favorite dish that I tried. The fish is quite light and flaky, and the fish flavor itself is just a little smoky and quite clean. The garnish that comes with it, some sort of legumes, went perfectly with the lighter meat. The contrast in both texture and taste was masterfully done, and I would get this next time I come as well.Also, the sangria pitchers here were well worth the cost. The beverage was light and a perfect drink for a summer day. Looking forward to my next visit!",0,0,0,Eric K.,"New York, NY",638,101,162
5.0,6/1/2018,"Absolutely exceptional restaurant. As you walk inside, you can't help but notice the amazing interior design and decor. The ambience screams classy, which I know isn't exactly everyone's cup of tea, but I love it. We got there when it just opened, so the restaurant was still quite empty, but quickly filled up as we got our food. I would definitely recommend getting a reservation as I can see the wait being fairly long without one. The food was amazing as well. We ordered a burrata to start- delicious but wasn't super memorable. But then again- I think it's rather difficult to make burrata stand out so I'm not holding this against them. What really got them the 5 stars is their entrees. I ordered a Mediterranean branzino. This dish swept me away. The skin was crispy and the meat was tender and flavorful. I also got to try the ahi tuna salad which was plated beautifully and the cook on the tuna was perfect. 100% would recommend checking out this restaurant if you're in NYC.

While they don't have a large lobby/reception area with seating, they were nice to bring over some chairs for individuals in the party who needed to sit.The dining room is beautiful--there are tall ceilings, vines, and other floral decorations. I assume the decor changes with the season like the food/menu items do. We were here for the wine dinner, which comes with 1 appetizer​, 1 entree, 1 dessert, and 4 wine tastings per person.We had a great experience overall. Many of us loved the ricotta cavatelli appetizer, as well as the park ave latkes, which we ordered for the table to share. Everyone seemed to enjoy their entrees as well. For a large restaurant​ in NYC, the acoustics were better than normal, and we could actually have a ​good conversation around the table.Part of what drew us to this restaurant was the wine dinner. We were served four different wines, which were all good. It would have been nice if each person could have picked the wines they wanted to try--the wines for the evening are set by the restaurant and served in a particular order so they aren't paired with your food. Customization would allow for each person to choose what they wanted to drink based on the entree they ordered as well as personal preferences. While I couldn't enjoy any of the desserts on the menu due to a dairy allergy, the restaurant put together a plate of fresh fruit for me. They brought out a special celebratory dessert for my boyfriend, as we were celebrating his graduation.

I'll definitely go back during other seasons to see what they do with the place. I'm sure it will be equally as beautiful.  We started at the bar and the bartender, Declan, was really awesome and helpful!  My drink? Great! Had the mule with the jalapeño and it had just the right kick. So good that after starting with a beer my husband ordered one as well after trying mine. Shortly after getting our drinks we were seated  in a large dining room - it was pretty loud but we could still hear one another.  Our waiter was Vincenzo and he was the best- just absolutely outstanding service from start to finish.The truffle amuse bouche to start was very good,  The seared hamachi with grilled pineapple appetizer was divine! The recommended lamb and duck breast were both cooked to perfection, tender and delicious.  Side items we tried were grilled asparagus, truffle fries, and artichoke- all done well. Our water glasses never were empty. At the end of the evening I tried their signature dessert, the cube as I love chocolate and it did not disappoint. We also had an unusual ice cream - basil- and I must say it was different but very good.  From the ambiance, to the service, right down to the food- Park Avenue Spring is a winner.  Definitely earned the five stars I've given. One of my better restaurant experiences.

Back in the winter it was just on an off chance and we sat at a table near the bar. I actually preferred this - was more casual and secluded than the main restaurant area and I actually think I preferred the winter menu. More recently we made a reservation for my wife's birthday in May. We were seated straight away at a table for two but they really do make the most of the space...I do enjoy how they change up the decor as well as the menu and the restaurant area was nice and lively. There is also another bar area in the restaurant section - presumably for people to grab a pre meal drink. Can't remember what I had to start but I loved the combination of fruit and seafood. I had the lamb for main (obviously, it's spring) and it was beautifully cooked - the first few bites were particularly amazing.

I would not change a thing. The bone marrow roasted leaks on the plate was divine. My wife went with the steelhead. She was please with it. It was divided into 4 small filets. More food then she could eat at that point. It was served with roasted beeets and beet puree. I personally preferred my dish but would not be upset with either.

There is also an option of all you can drink mimosas for $15 (three flavors of yuzu, passion fruit and raspberry). I ordered myself the crab and avocado toast which was an extra $5, but well worth it. In addition to this, for the entree, the everything crusted branzino was the way to go. It was so flavorful, super crispy and cooked thoroughly. I cannot get over the blend of flavors and am in awe still. Staff was amazing, super friendly and lots of fun.

Portions: really good considering we're all good eaters we all left super full.Apps:We ordered latkes for the table(delicious)Lemon cured Cesar salad(meh(Waffle and sausage-yummy Drinks:I got their cocktail($17 but strong), hubby got bloody mary(eh)Mains:All Delish but my niece ordered the best by getting the lamb shank which just fell off the bone. No knife required.Deserts:All divine. They threw in an extra dessert which we were too full to barely get through our own much less an extra so we boxed it up for our niece. Verdict:In the end we ended up paying $125 per person after adding 2 drinks, one extra app and tax and tip. YES, I'd do it again in spring just not during Easter. The Spring decor was AMAZING and we lucked out getting a beautiful both in the main room(the Open Table gods were with us). But Brunch prices are better(everywhere) NOT during Easter. We did make a day of it and decorated hats to stroll the Easter parade at St. Patrick's and enjoy the decorations at Rockefeller center.

Upon entering the staff checked us in but told us to wait until all parties arrived before we could be seated (I know this is a common policy of restaurants but also one of my annoyances since I can't be responsible for when others show up.) There was a complimentary coat check by the door, which is especially nice in the winter. Some of us in the group decided to go with the wine dinner menu (tasting of 3-4 different wines, choice of appetizer and entree). Butternut squash soup with lobster crudo appetizer and scallops entree were both amazing.  Crepe brûlée dessert was average.  This was part of their winter menu so would definitely come back to check out their spring menu!The decor was absolutely gorgeous; I felt like I stepped into a winter wonderland.  Bathrooms are meticulously clean also, needless to say.",0,0,0,Lan L.,"Boston, MA",74,158,116
5.0,3/27/2018,"I really enjoyed dinner here. From start to finish, each dish was surprising but amazing. I came with a friend for restaurant week. The one hiccup was our server was a bit rude, when he came to place the menus, he said ""are you here for restaurant week?"" We said yes and he said ""yeah I assumed so but sometimes people surprise you."" A bit glib to me but the food and ambience were wonderful I will definitely be back for other seasons. I had the crab cake for my appetizer, which was the best crab cake I've ever had and the fruit goes amazingly well with it. My friend had the steak tartare which is served on bread and is also great! For mains, I had the short rib which was excellent. All in all the food was amazing.I came back with my significant other for the wine dinner which is quite a steal.

5.0,3/14/2018,"To be honest, when I showed up last Saturday night, I wasn't in the mood. I wasn't in the mood to be out. I wasn't in the mood for a shmancy pants meal. And I certainly wasn't in the mood to be cramped in a tiny NYC restaurant sitting on top of the table next to me.But, color me charmed!Yes, the menu is a little on the fancy pants side, but it's definitely more accessible than I gave it credit for being. And this restaurant is huge, certainly by NYC standards, to be sure. And the staff was so receptive and friendly, it really helped turn my mood around. They couldn't have been more accommodating for our table. They tried to seat us in the back of the restaurant up a couple of stairs. When we asked to be switched to a table in the main dining room that didn't require steps, they immediately acquiesced. One hostess, Marika, was also kind enough to help our grandmother to the handicap accessible bathroom, even offering her her arm for stability. Our actual server was affable and kind, very happy to answer questions for us. The restaurant's sommelier was also helpful in making our wine selection.We started with the local burrata. It comes with roasted persimmon, creamy and delicious with the lovely burst of sweet acidity was perfect. When my brother and I dine together, we are fairly likely to order the burrata and this was an excellent iteration.I've never had hamachi crudo before, but I decided to suck it up and try it for the first time. It was delicious. I love marcona almonds and grapefruit and they really helped balance the salty fish.The Park Avenue Latkes were delicious. Perfect little bites. Plus they were served with an incredible apple mustard that was so yummy.We also got an order of garlicky greens which were delicious, not mind blowing, but they're exactly what you want them to be.For my main, I ordered the braised short rib, which is topped with pomegranate seeds. I have to say, I think I ordered best out of everyone. In fact, I was truly disappointed to trade plates when my brother, who I'd agreed to go halfsies with on the short rib and filet mignon, was ready for our switch.The filet was good, but I wasn't crazy about the sauce it was served with. The sauce was cloying and kind of salty. My cousin and mother both ordered the crab risotto. My mother was unhappy with it, however my brother said it was his favorite dish of the night. I tasted it, it was good, but wasn't my thing.My boyfriend ordered the scallops which he enjoyed and his grandmother ordered the steak tartare with foie gras. It's not something I'd generally order, but she gave me a taste and it was really good. Salty and savory without being overpowering.The desserts were truly incredible too.We ordered the sticky toffee gingerbread pudding, the bourbon pecan & walnut tart, the maple cinnamon creme brulee, and then for good measure we felt we needed some chocolate on the table, so we added the chocolate cube.Dessert Heaven.The creme brulee was my personal favorite and I've been dreaming of it ever since. But everyone had a different favorite and all had a valid reason why. There were no complaints about any of the desserts. Even the chocolate ancho sorbet that  think made people nervous on the chocolate cube, was delicious with just a slight burn.I can't wait to return, maybe try brunch or the wine dinner before the season changes over, but I also can't wait to see what spring brings to Park Ave.I'd be remiss if I didn't mention how absolutely gorgeous the restaurant is. The wintry decor is just fabulous. Again, I can't wait to see the other seasons.",3,0,0,Katie B.,"Brooklyn, NY",144,220,20

5.0,3/6/2018,"We went to Park Avenue Winter during New York Restaurant Week 2018 and could not have been happier with our decision. We were a large group of people (10+ people) and originally only offered a table in a private room which was supposed to be an additional fee of a few hundred dollars. Luckily, we were able to be accommodated in the main dining room for no additional cost after conversing with the manager. Their Restaurant Week Menu included a 3-course dinner (appetizer, main course, and desert) for only $42. The quality of the food and service was unmatched and we could not be happier. We also ordered additional plates for the table that were not on the menu but still exceeded our expectations.For the appetizer, I had the butternut squash soup with lobster croquette. The soup was poured table sided and was steaming hot. The soup was creamy and savoury without being salty. The perfectly seasoned soup provided a nice texture contrast to the lobster croquette which was fried perfectly and seasoned conservatively to accentuate the flavour of the lobster. Along side our appetizer, we order brussel sprouts with truffle pastry which were also both delicious.For the main course, I had a salmon with quinoa. The salmon was perfectly cooked, flaky, and had a rub with a very nutty flavour. What sets Park Avenue Winter apart from many other restaurants is their observance of seasons and ability to adapt their menu to it. At Park Avenue Winter, their dishes were hearty and warming to match the season. The quinoa was also delicious even to those that usually find it dry and unflavorful. For dessert, I had a black truffle cake with creme brulee. The cake was incredibly dense and was paired nicely with the lightness of the creme brulee. We were also served wine which paired perfectly with the dessert.All in all, this was a great restaurant with a great, affordable, and delicious Restaurant Week menu, The decor was beautiful and matched the season just like their menu.

Since we had a later reservation, some of us had had dinner already, but the host was very open about not everyone ordering food. We got some free bread and truffle potato balls to start, and two friends ordered mains.  I had two cocktails and a dessert. The food was okay (took a sampling). It came out quite fast (a little strange) and the portions were small.

Seated and ordered quickly. They provided a complimentary fresh focaccia bread with olive oil dip. Glad it wasn't stale and hard, it was even semi-warm! Pumpkin ravioli - started with my appetizer and it didn't disappoint! Great mix of flavors and the ravioli was stuffed with real pumpkin. One thing I didn't like was how oily my dish was. Local burrata - friend's appetizer was good but she felt that it was a bit overwhelming in portion and could have finished it as an entrée. Mediterranean branzino - this smelled SO fishy but shockingly, didn't taste fishy at all. It had that lovely fried crispiness crunch that I love in my fried fish and nice chunk of fish meat. Less oily than my pumpkin ravioli!Heritage pork loin - wow this was really good. The popcorn bits on top were weird but actually flowed with the meal. Pork loin was outstanding: great flavor, tenderness, perfectly cooked. Terrific grilling technique. Loved tasting the grill flavor.Black forest cake - extremely rich cake. Light mousse but heavy enough. Recommend you eat this last because it's so rich.Bourbon pecan and walnut tart - delicious! Fresh tart, nice crust, great mix of nuts and pear. Ice cream just made it even better.Overall, decent meal. Still a bit skeeved by how oily the pumpkin ravioli was.

Waiters work multiple areas and so either ignore you or all converge at once. 2. Multiple waiters asking same questions. 3. Waiter hovering to remove a dish while I'm still eating. 4.

It was classy, but not stuffy and the decor that changes based on the season was beautiful.Between the two of us, we got the pumpkin ravioli, peekytoe crabcake, Scottish salmon, braised short rib, sticky toffee gingerbread pudding, and black forest cake. The standouts were the pumpkin ravioli and braised short rib. The pumpkin ravioli was the most transformative in terms of flavor profile. The filling tasted nothing like pumpkin, and more like cheese ravioli. The textures were also great with the crunchy nuts on top. A well-balanced dish that was also creative. The braised short rib, while not as inventive as the pumpkin ravioli, was a solid plate. It was short rib as it should be. The pomegranate seeds complimented the meat very well. Some pieces were tough and a tad bit overcooked but mostly good. The salmon was probably the least enjoyed of the meal because it was a very thin piece of salmon it was way overcooked and dry. The other dishes we got were very delicious too, but just didn't leave an impression. In addition, they gave us complimentary homemade bread with olive tapenade and some truffle appetizer on the house.

The New American styled restaurant changes its menu with the season and coordinates the decor to match. Service:Our servers were attentive and friendly. They unhesitatingly brought us extra bread and the delicious pepper in olive oil concoction for dipping. They even unexpectedly brought us an extra amuse-bouche without us having to ask. Similarly when my main course, a pork chop came looking misshapen and a bit sad I didn't even have to finish asking before the waitress offered to bring me another.Drinks:The bar program left a bit to be desired. I appreciated the seasonal feel of the menu, with drinks including warm flavors like cinnamon and mulled wine, but the drinks themselves were often lacked the desired effects.Food:We did the restaurant week menu so our choices were more limited. That being said, portions were generous, and they did not cut quality despite the special.

I was sitting at the bar waiting for the SO which is fine, but it took quite awhile to get a bartenders attention to get the menu. Then, upon being seated at a table set for 4 really annoyed me. Maybe it's because this place had put on this air of sorts when I walked in that I expected more or better service? The table felt so cluttered with 4 settings until they finally cleared the other 2 settings away.The focaccia bread was nice and warm but the dip left more to be desired. I got the Peekytoe Crab cake as an appetizer which was flavorful and I enjoyed the citrus, but didn't care for the green sauce it came with. He got the Lobster Mac and cheese which the waitress had recommended but it was nothing spectacular and kind of bland. For my entree, I got the Alaskan king crab which came on a bed of risotto which was only ok. I ordered the Riesling that was paired w the king crab but was told shortly that they were out of it - on a Wednesday night, on Valentine's day. He got the branzino which was really fishy, blegh. The same green sauce on my crabcake was on the branzino dish to help cut down the fishiness. Maybe it was where we were seated, but the waitstaff was just walking around quickly that watching them do their beehive dance didn't really help give us the relaxing dinner we wanted.

4.0,2/13/2018,"Park Avenue WinterRestaurant Week (Winter 2018) review:Park Avenue Autumn/Winter/Spring/Summer has been on my list for quite some time. The restaurant offers a different menu and revises the restaurant name based on the current season. This restaurant is also pricey in general with entrees starting at $25+. We came here last week for dinner and took advantage of the $42 three-course dinner prix fixe restaurant week menu. We made reservations a few days before and the only convenient time slot for us was 7pm. We arrived to the restaurant pretty early (i.e. 6:15pm) and we were able to be seated right away since the restaurant wasn't super busy.I ordered the following:-Peekytoe Crab Cake (appetizer): Its one medium sized crab cake with orange and grapefruit slices and jalapenos slices. The crab cake tasted delicious and it had a crispy texture on top. The citrus and jalapeno slices goes well with the crab cake. I definitely recommend this appetizer!-Scottish Salmon (entree): Its salmon with a pistachio and sesame seed crust on top, Mandarin oranges slices, mint, shallots, and quinoa. The salmon was moist and cooked perfectly. I didn't enjoy the flavor combinations of the mint and shallots since it was kinda drenched with lemon/lime juice. I guess I should have mixed the mint and shallots with the quinoa. Overall, it was an OK entree and it kinda reminds me of a Thai Larb dish.-Black Forest Cake (dessert): This dessert was more of a chocolate mousse instead of a cake. There's also pistachio creme brulee inside and some berries. I really enjoyed the dessert and recommend it.Service was good and I was happy that we were able to get a table prior to our reservation time slot. The restaurant decor was really nice and they display fresh flowers as well. I would definitely comeback again one day.

My friend and I were seated in a more private space just a little past the main dining area with all the decorations. Our server presented my friend and I with their regular menu as well as the menu curated for restaurant week. We opted for the restaurant week menu. Here is what I recommend:Starters: 1. Roasted butternut soup - 5/5 highly recommend this one. It was so flavorful and beautifully presented. Also quite filling. 2. Pumpkin ravioli- 4/5 the ravioli was also delicious. Recommend it just as much as the soup except it came with so many pistachios (not a big fan of nuts in my food).Entree: Roasted fillet mignon!! 10/5 this was the winner for the day. It was perfectly cooked and so juicy and flavorful. Definitely worth the $10 upcharge. Dessert: 1) Black forest cake- 5/5 this was so delicious! If you're a fan of chocolate this one is for you. There is a pistachio creme brulee in the center that pairs really well with the chocolate. 2) Cookies and cream Ice cream- 4/5 this one was good but it was one of the simpler desserts. Something you can probably make at home but still good nonetheless. **Our server gave us an extra dessert which was a pecan pie with caramelized pears and ice cream. This was really great as well.

High ceilings, well lit. Tables were a little small and we had to pull it out for one of us to sit, but the decorations were nicely seasonal. I ordered the burrata, pork loin, and tart. I've never had burrata before. It was okay? It was like gooey cheese balloon thing. The gooey parts had almost no flavor, if anything it was like butter. The outer covering was good though! It was almost a lot for an appetizer honestly but I have kind of a small stomach haha. The pork loin was delicious. I don't know what sauces they used but one was a deep verdant green and one looked like (but did not taste like) maple syrup. It was fun to sit there and try to dissect the different flavors. Lastly, the tart was really good too. My only comment on it is that it tastes more like autumn than winter haha. My friend ordered the avocado/crab toast, pork loin, and the Black Forest cake. The avocado/crab toast was definitely a better choice than my burrata. There's a $5 supp. charge. The black Forrest cake was okay. It was more mousse than cake. Overall, I had a great experience.

5.0,2/9/2018,"This review is for Restaurant Week Winter 2018. I've heard of places not being quite up to par for Restaurant Week, but Park Avenue has definitely kept its high standards. The place was beautifully decorated in a white and silver theme for the winter. The service was very impeccable, with the waiters coming over regularly to fill up water and to make sure everything was alright. The food exceeded all my expectations. The appetizer, a pumpkin ravioli, was topped with a sweet mix of nuts and cranberries. I really enjoyed how the sweetness of the pumpkin inside was enhanced by this combination. I then ordered the braised short rib sandwich as my entree. The bread was nicely crispy, and the meat was easy to tear apart and very tender, but I personally wasn't blown away by this dish as much as I was by the fish that my friends ordered. They offered two different fish dishes: Mediterranean Branzino and Scottish Salmon. Both were some of the most flavorful pieces of fish I have ever had. The restaurant also paired both with pieces of citrus, which I thought completely elevated the experience, especially as the citrus was slightly chilled and the fish was a touch warmer than room temperature. Would highly recommend these dishes to even those who are not the biggest fans of fish. To finish off the meal, my table ordered both the Bourbon Pecan & Walnut Tart and the Black Forest Cake. The ice cream on the tart was supposed to be caramel, but I couldn't quite place my finger on what the flavor reminded me of. The chocolate on the cake was rich and decadent. I personally think that you can't go too astray with dessert, and thought both were sweet ways to end a delicious meal.

Dessert of German Chocolate Cake was lighter than expected and toffee pudding was also light. But best of all, the MUSIC! They played classic rock and we even got some Talking Heads and Lou Reed.

Perfectly cooked, paired with grilled cauliflower, cauliflower puree and pomegranate seeds. Insanely flavorful where nothing was on the plate that did not need to be there, a wonderfully composed dish. The side order of latkes were good, the rosemary apple sauce they came with was different and tasty. The black forest cake was not at all black forest, but it was delicious.

It melted in my mouth so easily and was a great start to the meal. I was deciding between the heritage pork loin and the salmon initially, and I am so happy I went with the pork loin. It was very filling, and it was seasoned well. The black forest cake was a lovely end to the meal. The red forest berries worked well with the creme brulee. Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed the meal and would recommend dinner here. Granted, it was quite busy for restaurant week so it was hard to capture our waiter's attention, but that's to be expected!",4,0,1,Tiffany L.,"New York, NY",351,140,222

3.0,1/27/2018,"I came here yesterday evening with my boyfriend for restaurant week with a reservation for 5:30 pm. Once entered the restaurant, we were seated immediately. For my appetizer, I chose the steak tartare. I would give this appetizer a solid 2.5/5.0 because of the dish being abnormally salty. I am not a picky eater at all; I eat just about everything, but I could not finish the steak tartare. For my entree, I chose to opt for the filet mignon. I would give this entree a 5.0/5.0. The taste of this dish reminds me of a taste that I would get if I ordered beef at an Asian restaurant because of its sweetness. A lot of Asian restaurants marinate their meat to be sweet, so it tasted pretty similar to the filet mignon here. For my dessert, I chose the spiced pomegranate and pear sorbet. I would give this dessert a 4.0/5.0. There were a lot of different, yet explosive flavors in this sorbet. It was topped off with pomegranate seeds, which was a nice touch.The reason as to why I gave a lower rating is because of the discourtesy of getting the check handed to us, right when the dessert was placed on our table. We did not even get to take a bite out of the dessert nor did we ask for the check, but it was given to us which made us feel pressured to quickly pace ourselves. ""Whenever you're ready,"" is what the waiter said. When we're ready, we will ask for it ourselves. The restaurant had a lot of open tables and there were no customers waiting to be seated, so what's the rush? Despite this minor pet peeve, I still gave a 15% tip  since the service was generally up to par.",0,1,0,Emily T.,"New York, NY",78,61,113

Our food tasted exactly like it looked, amazing.  We ordered different items so we could try a little bit of each others dishes.  Altogether we ordered the parfait, salmon, pastry, and filet mignon.  Everything surpassed my expectations, the food was just phenomenal.I will definitely be coming back here in the near future.",1,1,0,Stephen L.,"New York, NY",309,372,5722

The host was going to seat us in a small room but we asked to be seated in the main dining room. The host had no problem accommodating our request. Nice! I had the butternut soup as last time during the summer RW and it was very flavorful. Loved the little touch like the soup plate/bowl was hot to keep the soup nice and warm. My friend had the pumpkin ravioli which was excellent.I had the Bronzino which was very fresh and the skin was perfectly pan fried. My friend ordered the salmon medium rare which was delicious. My other friend ordered the pork loin which was good but a bit dry.Let's talk about desserts which are usually the best part of the meal. I had the pecan tart and I loved the crust! My friend had the sorbet which was very refreshing and light. The Black Forest cake was very cute looking and tasted good. Overall, we had a really great time.

First pour was ok we elected to switch to another white - you know what he did he poured it on top of the existing wine he said they dont switch glass on white wine. Omg this was ridiculous i didnt want to make a scene bec its my sisters bday. Two different wines in the same glass- we specifically told him we didnt care for the first  wine. Guess how long it took him to get take our orders another 30 minutes - we asked all the buzz boys pls grab him..... we finally got our dishes did he ever checked on us NO- did he ever asked to switch or perhaps wanted a refill of the wine freaking NO . We had to ask the while time- after 2 hrs of ridiculousness the other server decided to help us bec our server was no where to be found. Food was extremely salty, dry, over cooked.

3.0,1/23/2018,"My review came a little bit delay. My friend hosted her birthday dinner last week at Park Avenue Winter :). First, I do like its four-season theme as you could happy tasting along with change in seasons. Secondly, I do love the decorations here, really decent, and the services were good. But... it's a little dark here in the restaurant, I couldn't read the menu w/o iPhone light...not that suitable for social event. I will only give 3-3.5 star, as I'm not that amazed by the food here, though I set really high expectations before I came to the restaurant. Our table ordered almost every dish of seafood and meat, pairing with two bottles of wine. The wine were just so-so. I do like the king crab risotto, but scallops or halibut were just normal. I have expected a restaurant like Park Avenue have far more than that. Finally, the dessert is actually the worst...I can't imagine a restaurant could have such weird taste of Sorbet.. Other desserts were not good as well. A fine dining place should be good at desserts as well; otherwise it will only leave bad impression after the dinner.

1.0,1/7/2018,"I have no idea what is up with the yelp reviews for this place, but this is the worst fucking brunch spot in NYC.  Maybe their dinner service is better, I don't know.  We get there around 1pm, and get seated immediately.  Our server, Bianca, takes her dandy fucking time to come to us with the menus and then even more time to come back to ask about what kind of water we wanted. 'Distilled is fine, thank you'; comes back with San Pellegrino sparkling water after 15 minutes of waiting. Uhhhh ok thanks.  Then we both get the fixed course menu, consisting of a pastry, appetizer, and entree.  They only have one pastry on the menu, of which we only got one order...? Shouldn't we have gotten 2 considering we both got the fixed course? We didn't bother to ask for a second plate of the pastry because it was way too heavy. Moving on to the appetizer, I got a crab-something avocado toast, and my partner got smoked trout johnnycake.  Both were incredibly fishy, just absolutely filthy quality fish and crab prepared in really unappetizing ways.  The toasted bread in my dish was probably the best component of the appetizers, sadly.  Nothing like entering your entree with dirty vagina breath right?Luckily the main entree took more than 30 minutes to come as the fishy tastes in our mouths ripened, and I had to ask some other server where the fuck our food was because 'Bianca' was dawdling in a corner of the restaurant like a psych ward patient instead of coming to inform us about why the fuck our food wasn't here yet.  10 minutes later Bianca comes with our food and doesn't apologize, instead saying 'yea uhhh, there was a small delay in the kitchen'.  Yea no fucking shit you sad example of a service industry employee.  What's the point of pinning up your employees in nice button-down serving clothing if they've got the decency of prison cafeteria line cooks?  Take a look at my pictures to see what a fucking disaster the entrees were.  The less offensive dish was my fried chicken sandwich with coleslaw.  It's basically this dark meat panko fried piece of garbage sitting on a dry bun and then topped with mounds of this tree bark and woodchip medley.  It was awful.  Then there was my girlfriend's smoked salmon eggs benedict.  The first time it came the eggs were literally hard boiled straight through.  I complained politely and Bianca came back after 20 minutes with another eggs benedict, or at least that's what she claimed.  Take a look at the picture, but basically it was a steaming pile of hot garbage, just like Bianca and this entire establishment.  0/10 absolute shit",5,16,0,Sangduk S.,"College Park, MD",215,71,56

The front desk of our hotel booked us the reservation and asked the restaurant to pleasantly surprise my friend with an extra dessert on the house for her birthday - thanks! :) The only unpleasant part of the experience was calling to move our reservation. I had requested to move it to a later time to ensure that we could participate in the dinner special (only available after 8:30pm) but also tried to make sure that the 'surprise' was still included.

I'm a fan of the menu layout, a simple grouping of small plates and larger entrees with respective wine recommendations that changes with each season. The food itself was great, and we enjoyed the Filet Mignon and Pork Chop with a Hamachi Crudo appetizer, all of which were prepared very well. The entree prices were high ($35-45), but we were more taken aback by the $20 cost for our glasses of wine, which were okay at best. Our server was nice, although not particularly attentive at points, and the supporting staff was great.In the end, Park Avenue felt like a restaurant straddling the line between upscale casual and fine dining, and I recommend you approach it as the former and less-so the latter.

We were a party of 4 , upon arrival we had a cocktail and were served by 2 very nice bartenders . we were seated at 4:30 with a new waitress that had only been with the restaurant for a short time. While being nice , she had no personality , handed us menus, walked away , returned less than 5 minutes later and asked if we were ready to order. We said , no and asked for a wine menu , she returned with one and asked if we were ready to order food.  We said no, and asked if we could order wine. The sommelier came by and we ordered a bottle of wine ( Great recommendation by him) . As he was pouring the wine our waitress came by and asked if we were ready to order . 3 times within 10 minutes . If I could rate the restaurant on food  and presentation , it would have been 6 stars . Food  ( both years) was wonderful and pretty enough to photograph ! Our issue with this visit was being rushed from the time the menu came , till the time we paid the bill, but not only the server but the bus boys who took away plates before we were finished. While this place serves 5 star food , The wait staff is not up to par with the quality of the food .

Tasty wine selection.Came here during Christmas weekend with my boyfriend and we opted for the Wine dinner. You choose an appetizer & entree to be paired with four wines selected by the chef for 65$ per person:A Prosecco to start,A floral Sauvignon Blanc with your appetizer, a light but bold Pino Noir after that,& then an exquisite full bodied Super Tuscan as you end your meal. For appetizer, I chose the Cavatteli & Smoked clams. The cavatelli was coated in rapini pesto and spicy n'duja. The flavor in this dish was incredible, every bite was so complex and fresh... and all the flavors played perfectly with each other. My boyfriend opted for the Peekytoe Crab Cake, this was great-no bread filler in the crab cake just delicious crab in every bite. The Sauvignon Blanc went incredible with these dishes, my boyfriend and I were obsessed with the smell and flavor of the wine. (Our awesome waiter even topped off our glasses for us when he came around after our app) Before we even finished our second(3rd) glass, our next wine arrived-now transitioning to red,Pino Nior-(SIDE NOTE) at this point I was totally tipsy this is NOT a dinner for faint of heart. For our main dish we both opted for the Filet Mignon (as recommended by our waiter). The filet was covered in wild mushrooms and an incredible red wine reduction. This went INCREDIBLE with the Super Tuscan wine.After another top off of our wine (woof) came dessert. I had my favorite dessert-crem brûlée (an apple cinnamon) Overall this dinner was a whole experience-from the decor, to slowly getting drunk off exceptional wines while eating amazing food...I cannot wait to come back when the winter theme is transformed to spring!",0,0,0,Liz G.,"Mount Vernon, NY",135,136,211

We shared a bottle of red he recommended (all bottles are $80). It was a perfectly smooth dinner wine. Then, we shared burrata and Brussels sprouts salad.

They were really just a tease to get you in the mood for even more incredible food that was waiting...so we got another round in the meantime. For my appetizer, I ordered the bucatini with salmon and caviar. This is a light pasta dish which I made everyone else at the table try. I was also able to snag some of the butternut soup which was just as delicious. For my main meal, I got the 5oz filet mignon with an egg and veggies (I believe kale, mushroom, and zucchini). I was a little worried the portion wouldn't be enough but struggled to finish all of it - and believe me, I wanted all of it! The waiter brought out dessert menus while they filled up our coffee. After he explained the options and gave us a little time to talk it over, we told him we were too full and asked for the check. He decided to bring out the white forest mousse anyway because we had to have it. It didn't matter how stuffed we felt. We ate all of it!

5.0,11/7/2017,"Almost a year ago I was searching for a place on Yelp to have drinks while eating at the bar area. My favorite area - the mixologists here are friendly and amazing (more about them in a bit).When I searched for lunch on a Saturday this place came up twice. I figured, ""let me click on it and check it out"". After reading some mixed reviews and seeing the amazing photos of their food I gave them a shot. Thank you Yelpers for guiding me here.Let's start with the decor - they change it every season (say what?!?!) along with the food and drink menu. That's a unique twist to a restaurant in NYC. Here are my favorite traits this restaurant offers:AMAZING StaffThey serve you fresh baked bread or corn muffin (season pending), as you wait for your foodNew items are added to the menu each seasonThe quality of the food.....................Sorry got hungry thinking about the juicy fresh burgers I've eaten here and their amazing fresh crab on avocado, served over fresh bread (getting hungry again). Worth coming here for sure. Now food we can speak about all day, yet the staff here deserves the recognition. Let's start with the mixologists - ALL are amazing! They are all tentative to each patron taking a seat at the bar, they are willing to have real conversations with you and not just talk to talk. They care about what they do. To the point of creating new drinks per season, voting on them, and featuring the winning drinks in their menu. It does not stop there, the moment you walk in the hostess is greeting you with a smile and the general manager will pass by to check in on his guest (customer service level ).As a regular here I'm greeted with warm/genuine smiles, friendly handshakes and a true ""Hey James, how have you been?"".

2.0,11/4/2017,"Went here for my 4 year anniversary with my boyfriend for the wine dinner and our meal just just OK. I called earlier to confirm the reservation and the host asked if we were celebrating anything, so I told him yes, and he said wonderful, I'll let your server know - nothing was ever mentioned of the sort by our server. The meal started out awkward as when we asked for the best things on the menu, he only suggested the items that were a supplement charge, which never reflects well, as now we just assumed he wanted to inflate our check. The first glass of wine (prosecco) was great, nice and dry, really easy to drink.The first round of food came, we got the squash and ricotta and the quail. Our main disappointment was that the food came 6 minutes after we ordered (I checked the time), which means it was not made to order. The squash was ice cold, I had to send it back. The next round was great with warm squash and a delicious plate. The quail was awesome, very different dish than I had expected.The server wouldn't pour me the next glass of wine (even though it was supposed to be pairings with each course) until I finished my prosecco, I shared that I didn't want to finish it and would like a new glass and he was pretty caught off guard, but did so.  The second course we got the scallops and venison. Both were fine, but I'm a scallops LOVER and wasn't floored here. That is not to say it wasn't delicious, I just had really built the meal up in my head and it didn't match my expectations. Again, it took us a while to get the next glass of wine.Finally our server came over to check in on us (after finishing a course and a half) to ask how our meal is, which we said good, cause I don't like to complain too much.The dessert was great, we got the creme brule and the sundae. Nothing special but great flavors. The server came over and poured the last glass of wine for my boyfriend but not me because I did not finish the other glass. He walked away then quickly turned around to ask if ""I wanted any"" but I passed. Overall, the food did not amaze me, everything was pretty cold. We felt rushed. Each course came out moments after we ordered (or for entree, moments after we finished our appetizers) and it just wasn't what it was played up to be. Pretty disappointed as we saved up for this meal. I'd like to return to see the winter menu and decor, but I'll have to see.",0,0,0,Ilissa K.,"New York, NY",0,34,4

1.0,10/22/2017,Had great lunch here last year. Dinner last Saturday night was just horrible. Empty restaurant seated next to noisy waiter station with water pitchers literally stationed over my husbands right shoulder. The waiter had a bad attitude right after we passed on ordering any alcohol. We were literally done with our dinner within 25 minutes.The pasta was beyond aldente and the chicken was so dry I couldn't chew a bite without a drink of water.  I did tell him my appetizer was not cooked enough. Not one comment was said on his behalf.  Then the waiter lingered too long every time he came by. It was an odd lingering not being attentive. He made us uncomfortable and made us feel like there was something wrong each time he came by and said everything was good or fine. Naturally it wasn't.Overall a very different experience from my lunch a year ago.,0,0,0,Nicole C.,"Newport Beach, CA",1,13,0

4.0,10/14/2017,"I've seen this location go through a couple of iterations in my years in NYC, but I haven't made it to Park Avenue and its seasonally-themed restaurant until recently, when my wife and I decided to hop out on a last-minute reservation. I had forgotten how large the space can be, and with a relatively large bar area, replete with long stand-up tables, as well as a majestic dining room, where the decorations change with the seasons, it has the feel of a very grand spot to eat a meal. That said, despite the large space, the tables are squeezed in tight in typical New York fashion (there was at most a foot separating us from the diners next to us), so you will get an earful of your neighbors' conversations. Service was pretty prompt (we were done eating here in roughly an hour), making it more bearable. The drink list was okay, but the beer selection is very limited (surprising, since you could definitely make a long seasonal beer list from local brews), and the cocktail I had came with too much ice and was too strong from the get-go - meaning that it went from too strong to watered-down over the course of the meal...there was no happy medium. That was a shame, given that the elegance of the bar setup suggests the drinks should be good.That said, the food here is quite excellent. I really enjoyed the bread service, which were mini-loafs of pine nut bread served with a butter lightly infused with maple, giving it a nice early-fall flavor. We shared the beef tartare to start, and that was incredible, especially given the foie gras it was served atop...combined with a little truffle, and you had a very decadent tartare that is one of the tops I have had anywhere. Our main courses were similarly good as well, if not quite at the same knock-your-socks off level. I really enjoyed the preparation of my New Zealand king salmon - poached and extremely tender and flaky. However, while I really liked the pesto it was served with, the sauce was too dry, making it a bit dissonant from a texture perspective. My wife's duck was delicious, with a few strips of breast sliced and cooked perfectly, served in au jus (the servers were a bit late coming over to add it to the dish - the only real blemish).I'd definitely come back for another meal, based on the strength of the early-autumn meal we enjoyed here. Despite initially seeming like a hokey concept, the seasonality of the restaurant, and the ambiance that the changes provide, do work very well with a very good food menu as well. I do just wish that the drinks were a bit better, especially since the bar area at the front looks great as well.",0,0,0,Asuka N.,"New York, NY",371,1653,169

The service is top notch, and our particular server was super sweet. The food... Well, it was good. A friend took me there for my birthday and we had brunch. My appetizer was very tasty, but undercooked (risotto was super watery), and my entrée was very good... once I removed the poached eggs. They were listed as such on the menu, but after having such a watery risotto, I just couldn't even look at runny eggs lol. That is totally on me. Like I said, the flavor was great. Then there was dessert. I had some sort of pear and nut torte. It was life-changing. I'm a true sucker for a person that can have an idea, and perfectly translate it into a different medium. Park Avenue did it with this dessert. It was the absolutely epitome of the Autumn season. And... the server gave it to me free of charge because of my birthday!

5.0,10/2/2017,"My friend's aunt took me and her nephew here for Rosh Hashanah dinner. My late father was a huge fan of Park Avenue Cafe back in the day. That and Gotham Bar and Grill (plus an Italian, I think, called Christcella or something, downtown) were his favorite New York restaurants to go with clients and colleagues when in the city for work. I didn't even realize it had been reincarnated in the present form. Park Avenue Cafe, long before farm-to-table or tasting kitchens, changed the menu each season. It was a New York institution on Park and 63rd (a block from where I live, and the current home of Michael White's Vaucluse). This is a perfect place for an anniversary or special occasion. Not, I think, for a proposal because it's loud. Our server was extraordinary and a philosophy major in college. So basically, as this PhD candidate in English with a lot of philosophy in grad school can attest, a super smart person who struggles to find work in his field. There is a 65 dollar prix fixe wine pairing (SUCH a deal) after 8:30pm. But our reso was for 7pm and yes, it was pricey. But we had three appetizers, three entrees, wine, and a dessert. I could go into detail about the menu but there's not much point since the fall menu will start soon (if it hasn't already). My friend, however, is a writer for Forbes. He covers food, spirits, and hotels all over the world. Wineries too.I'm not a food writer, but I care about food. And his aunt has been a New Yorker all her life. This was not, in other words, an easily impressed crowd. Highlights: 1) Corn agnolotti (appetizer portion was large; I cannot imagine the entree). 2) Scallops: tender, flavorful, juice. Complex preparation which I should have photographed on the menu. Suffice to say, among the best scallops of my life. 3) Burrata and squash appetizer: HOME RUN. 4) Venison: outstanding. 5) Latkes: tiny bursts of wonderfulness with a special applesauce and sour cream. The booths are spacious so you feel like you have a lot of room, though it's loud. The bathrooms downstairs are majestic.

2.0,8/19/2017,"Decor is gorgeous and service is friendly and terrific.I went for the Wine Dinner and the food was disappointing. There were nice touches such as watermelon cubes and cornbread to start the meal, and our appetizers were tasty. Nothing spectacular, but still good. However, our entrees (lobster and filet mignon) and desserts were disappointing. The lobster had a unusually soft and mushy consistency, and the filet was fatty with an off-tasting tomato and hazelnut side. The desserts, in particular, the black forest cake, had a mealy texture, wasn't that rich, and was basically gross. For $65 per person I thought the wine dinner would be a steal, but considering the quality of the food, it wasn't. (And our entrees each had an $8 supplemental fee, which was disclosed on the menu when we ordered and is fair, but my point is, they were still disappointing.)",0,0,0,Mike J.,"Manhattan, NY",0,12,0

Although we were late too be seated the food and drinks were delicious and the decor matched.I started with the corn gnocchi, which was incredible - one of the best parts of the meal! It was an interesting combo packed with flavor! My Boyfriend had the Tuna appetizer, which was also very good. Main courses I had the salmon, cooked well with an avocado puree, and thinly sliced zucchini - it was a great compliment to the meal. My boyfriend go the pork chops, which he loved! They were cooked well and the sauce was great.For dessert I ordered the key lime and coconut tart which was light and refreshing and a nice end to the meal. My boyfriend, who doesn't like chocolate, ordered the black forrest as the menu listed pistachio and cherries and was surprised when it was a chocolate dish.

5.0,8/18/2017,"Park Avenue is my favorite restaurant week location. The menu and decor changes seasonally, making it exciting to visit at different times in the year. Their deals for restaurant week are incredible, especially lunch which has the same menu as dinner, but at a heavily reduced price. I just visited during the summer and got the corn gnocchi with fresh shaved truffle that was rich and delicious, the branzino which was fresh with a perfectly crisp skin, and the coconut key lime pie. Forgot to mention - the bread was a warm cornbread shaped as a clamshell with a maple chipotle butter. We asked for seconds...

5.0,8/18/2017,"I've been to this restaurant several times. It has always delivered good memories, particularly on the pork chop. This time, I came for restaurant week. For app,I got the corn gnocchi with truffles. If you like corn, this is a dish to get. Truffles compliment it well. For entrees,I got the pork loin which was cooked different than my previous visits. It's seasoned with dry rub and not evenly cooked. Part of it is overcooked and hence not as juicy, while the other part is cooked nicely. The grits and mustard helps to compensate for the overcooked portion.For dessert, I got the black forest cake which is pretty good.Overall, this is a good meal. Would have been much more impressive if they nailed the pork loin better by cooking it evenly and not overcooking it.",0,0,0,Bevano L.,"Jersey City, NJ",86,105,263
3.0,8/18/2017,A beautiful restaurant!  Bartender hostess and server welcoming and eager to please.  Family all decided to choose the restaurant week menu.  The gnocchi and tuna appetizers were outstanding. Bread and flavored butter delicious.  Where they disappointed was the entree.  The Pork was a large chunk of perfectly seared terribly  tough meat.  One had to cut tiny pieces off to make it chewable.   I wouldn't be so critical if I didn't see previous yelpers also complain about the pork.  Either take it off the menu or prepare it properly.  The salmon was very good.  Also....the desserts were a disappointment.  Overly sweetened sorbet and dry tart left us forgetting the earlier excellent appetizers.,0,0,0,Laurie B.,"Morristown, NJ",1,40,0

4.0,8/15/2017,"I visited Park Avenue Summer during summer restaurant week. I had made a reservation prior for 8pm. When we got there it was clear that they were backed up because the there were about 10-15 other people waiting near the hostess booth so we were finally seated around 8:20. The tables are definitely very close together and it is quite noisy but honestly that is to be expected at a trendy popular NYC restaurant. It was packed inside with basically every table filled, and it is a large space. They start off by bringing you a watermelon skewer, nothing special about it basically just a cube of watermelon but nice touch. As well as bringing you some cornbread with a special butter, not sure what was in it but it mixed nicely with the cornbread. We proceeded to order our meals, I opted for the corn gnocchi after reading the stellar reviews on yelp. It was an interesting dish, I enjoyed it but my date did not. The actual corn gnocchi is very good, tender on the inside and because it is fried it has a nice crisp on the outside. I don't whether it was the sauce with the truffle or what but it had a certain sour taste, I didn't mind it but it was strong. As my main course I chose the Branzino which was included two fairly nice sized pieces of fish. The skin on the fish was crispy but the fish was tender and moist. It was accompanied by a fresh salsa of sorts. The dish was very tasty and I surprised myself by finishing the whole thing. My date got the salmon which was also cooked to perfection and accompanied by a fresh Cucumber, Avocado & Dill salad... very heavy on the dill. For dessert we both chose the Key Lime & Coconut Tart with Graham Cracker Cookie and Meringue. I have to say this was a bit of a letdown. With all of the other dishes being creative and tasty I was expecting something more for this dish. The coconut portion was a let down and was very gelatin like which I did not enjoy. The crust was tasty but was extremely hard and it was difficult to cut through.Overall it was a very good experience, the place is decorated exquisitely and despite how busy they were the service was very good!

3.0,8/10/2017,"Closer to a 3.5 maybe but I have to round down. Rather decent food let down by poor service during Restaurant Week. I secured a reservation for 2 at 1 PM for 2 people. We got there a few minutes earlier, but weren't seated until 1:10 because the table before was taking long. Much to my dismay the restaurant was horribly overcrowded, with Barely enough room to squeeze between the tables. The table was not even wiped clean when we sat down.It took us a while before we were table to finally flag down our waiter to take our order. We both opted for the corn gnocchi, and we decided to get the chicken and the pork as the entrees. For the dessert, we got the key lime tart and the chocolate mousse. The cornbread starter by itself wasn't that great - the texture wasn't that good, and it was sorely lacking in flavor. However, the butter provided with the cornbread was quite tasty actually, and together made the cornbread a little better. The corn gnocchi was probably the best part of the meal. This was one of the best gnocchi s I've ever had - the dough was amazingly light and not heavy or tightly packed at all. The corn and the truffle went so well together. However, I feel that the sear on the gnocchi could have been more aggressive. The sear adds flavor and a crunchier exterior which would have made this dish incredible. The pork entree was quite nice actually. The pork had this amazing crust and sear on it, and if you didn't cut it open you would think it was a piece of filet mignon. The pork itself was perfectly cooked, however a bit tough to saw through. The purée was nice and sweet and went well with the pork. The chicken on the other hand was a major disappointment. It was very overcooked, and reminds me of a Chinese style chicken with super dry white meat and crispy skin. I would not recommend the chicken at all.The desserts were rather disappointing per usual - one dimensional in flavor and very boring - IMO a waste of calories and stomach room.None of the food items stood out to me other than the corn gnocchi. The seating arrangement in the restaurant was way too stuffy and WAY TOO CLOSE TO THE OTHER DINERS. I was just trying to have  a conversation with my friend and the people sitting next to us somehow inserted themselves into our conversations. PLEASE STAY AWAY.

I had the branzino which was light and delicious, my SO had the porkchops. The one complaint we had was that the porkchops came out rare and we sent it back only for it to come out med rare.

We did come for restaurant week so it wasn't too pricey, and the portions are enough to satisfy you for the night. Everyone is all dressed up and the atmosphere is good.

First, the decor is outstanding and we both very much enjoyed the oyster shell chandelier that adorns the dining space we were seated in. The atmosphere is vibrant, but not too loud to where you would have to yell to talk to your table. Pre-appetizer, we were brought cornbread with chipotle butter and watermelon and feta skewers, both of which were delicious and helped set the tone for the meal to come. For appetizer, we shared the yellowfin tuna and avocado with champagne mango ice and the smoked ricotta cavatelli. The fish was tender and blended beautifully with the mango ice and yuzu kosho. The cavatelli was perfectly cooked and the tomato and Calabrian chili topping was delicious. Moving on to dinner, I enjoyed the heritage pork lion with cornbread grits and peach mustard. The pork was very well cooked and nicely seasoned, the mustard was a perfect compliment, and I was quite excited to locate bacon bits in the accompanying kale salad. My girlfriend ordered the branzino ""low country style"" which was absolutely delicious. For dessert, I enjoyed the black forest cake with pistachio crème, although it was not very cake like. My girlfriend opted for the key lime coconut tart, which was outrageously delicious and refreshing.

5.0,8/5/2017,"This is a review for the summer season of the restaurant. I've been here many times in the past, but last night was one of the finest, and reminds me why this remains one of my favorite new york spots. Our server, Xanthus, was one of the best I've had in any restaurant--even including 3 michelin star establishments. He knew the menu with complete detail and was extremely personable. The food was completely a hit. We had the Summer restaurant week menu. I had the filet mignon, perfect medium rare, with hazelnut romesco and a tomatillo sauce. Normally, I find the filet lacks flavor, but this rivaled a ribeye but even more tender. For appetizers, I can't stress how good the sweet corn gnocchi is. One of the best starters I have ever had, and one of the top 3 dishes I've ever eaten in my life. Its a must try, and I would go to this restaurant just for this. Going to come back for autumn, and experience this restaurant in every season. Great job to the Park Ave staff!",0,0,0,John D.,"Manhasset, NY",0,26,6
4.0,8/4/2017,"I came here for Restaurant Week lunch in the summer - overall I'd say the food was solid and I'd be interested in returning during the other seasons to see what else they have in rotation. The corn gnocchi starter was my favorite dish - I loved the combination of the crisp gnocchi on top of the creamed corn with a hint of truffle. I got the salmon for my entree, which was seasoned somewhat unremarkably - just salt and pepper, I think, with thin strips of cucumber and crisp yam as a side. I didn't care for the avocado puree. The fish was cooked perfectly, but just didn't really stand out.Lastly, the key lime and coconut tart was goood. It's less key lime and more coconut, with a crisp pastry crust, a meringue ring bordering coconut custard bordering a key lime curd center, like a bullseye. I thought it was awkward that I was served a spoon to eat it instead of a fork, which meant I had to occasionally double-handedly spear the tart (and risk it shooting across the table), but I guess that didn't stop me from finishing it.The seasonal decor is what really makes this place stand out, of course. It's beautiful and spacious and really would be quite a stunner to impress your dining partner with.",0,0,0,Jin C.,"New York, NY",36,1100,328

It was done perfectly and not dry at all. My friend got the chicken and it was also very good. Between the two, I prefer my pork loin dish. For dessert, we both got the Black Forest cake which was more of a chocolate mousse cake which I had no complaints about. I love chocolate mousse. It was chocolatey but not overly sweet. It was the perfect ending to the perfect meal. The dishes were well seasoned and beautifully plated.

4.0,8/3/2017,"Came here for the wine dinner, which consists of an appetizer, entree and dessert plus unlimited tastings of four types of wine for $65pp, available at or after 8:30pm. Note that there is a separate listing for the wine dinner on Opentable that's different from the regular one for Park Avenue. All in all, the wine dinner was a really good deal! The restaurant was super packed for a Monday evening (perhaps partly due to restaurant week), so it was a little noisy inside and the table we were sat at were a little close to each other. However, the interior is beautiful and makes for a great date night spot. The wine dinner menu lets you choose an appetizer, entree and dessert from a long list, with an additional charge for the filet, lobster and chocolate cube dessert. There's also a list of supplemental sides to share for the table that you can order in additional to the set menu. FOODAmuse bouche (complimentary): - Watermelon with goat cheese: Not a super big fan of this; essentially mostly tasted like a regular cube of watermelon. Cute presentation though, and it was free so no complaints! - Cornbread with spicy butter: Loved this! Texture was perfectly crumbly and it was served warm, with the butter giving it just the right kick and moisture. Appetizers: - Octopus: Really tender and well cooked! - Sweet corn agnolotti: Essentially a long, ravioli-like pasta with a creamed corn sauce. It was pretty cool when the server brought out a whole truffle and shaved a very generous serving over the dish at the table! Truffle flavor wasn't overpowering, corn was well flavored and portions were huge! Entrees: - Halibut: Very flaky, with a good mix of flavors to round out the relatively delicate flavor of the fish- Duck: Really, really good! Comes with two sizable portions of duck that were very flavorful. Dessert: - Chocolate cube ($5 supplement): Worth the additional charge! This seems to be their signature dish - essentially a hard chocolate shell in the shape of a cube filled with mousse and served with ice cream. Great play on textures and really fun to look at! - Key lime tart with coconut: Was pretty good! Would've maybe tried one of the other desserts instead, but this was a good refreshing choice for a dessert. SERVICE / wineAt the very start, our server was a little bit busy and did not check back as often as I would've liked, although it was understandable since the tables were packed, and he was very friendly. We got a prosecco to start off with, which was really good and light - perfect for a starter. Since the website advertised unlimited tastings of wine, we were kind of expecting the server to check back on us with regards to the wine once we finished the glass of prosecco, but he didn't. The second glass of wine (a white) was served with our main course, which still left the other two wines to accompany the dessert course. In that regard, pacing of the wine pairings could be spaced out better. We asked for the third glass to come as we were finishing off the main course since the red would pair nicely would the duck, and it was promptly poured. Our server also checked back on us more often after the dinner rush died down a little, and service was very good towards the end of the meal. We also were asked if we wanted additional pourings of the wine. All in all, really good service - and prompt pourings of wine, even if you might have to be proactive in asking for additional pourings / faster pacing.",0,0,0,Yolanda C.,"Philadelphia, PA",160,126,552

4.0,7/4/2017,"I'm going to need to write my review first before decided on the stars this place will get. So, I came here for brunch on a Sunday. It was fairly empty. I can see this place getting pack for dinner though. They have the summer theme up which was cute. For brunch, they have a prefix menu which you get to pick on appetizer and one entree. I can't really recall what I got. The salmon pasta appetizer was good. I really enjoyed that dish. It wasn't overwhelming. As for the crab avocado toast, the amount of crabs they gave you was huge. I had to pick on it with my fork before I can bite into it. For the entree, I didn't enjoy the fish. The crispy texture on the top just didn't go well with the fish which was fresh. Also, there were too many sauces. So I had a hard time tasting the freshness of the fish. As for the steak with eggs, it was perfect. The steak was medium rare just the way I like it but the portion is fairly small. Therefore, it might not be filling for people who eats big portion. Service was decent. They came to refill our water when it was almost empty and cleared the plates when they were empty. So 3.5 for this place but since you can't give .5, I guess I'll just have to put 4 stars.",0,0,0,Cristina L.,"Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, NY",145,284,641

Dirty aprons, crowding us, looking to take away our bread before we were done, didn't even ask first, I ordered an expensive pork chop. Half of it was so fatty it was uneatable.

Our wine glasses were watched thoroughly and refilled reliably and without hesitation. In fact, they were so good about refilling our glasses that I became a danger unto myself.Appetizer:Local Burrata - I love burrata, and this was the best I've ever had. It was incredibly fresh and had a smooth, rich texture. The peaches were grilled perfectly, and paired well with the simple salad.Entree:Scallops - Perfectly cooked, excellently seasoned. Each scallop was adorned with a paper thin slice of iberico ham, which really brought the whole dish together. The flavors were really dancing on this plate.Dessert:Lemon Creme Brûlée - This dish added a fun twist to a classic dessert, and it really worked. The lemon curd base was just sweet enough and just tart enough. The lemon cookie accompanying the curd was a welcome surprise. The sugar layer on top made a satisfying *crack* upon eating.

5.0,6/17/2017,"I've been here a few times for their spring and summer menu.Wine Dinner:Most recently came with my boyfriend for their park avenue summer wine dinner, which includes any appetizer per person, any entree per person (lobster and filet are an $8 supplement) and any dessert per person (chocolate cube is a $5 supplement). In addition to the 3 courses you also get unlimited amount of 4 kinds of wine. I was worried our server would just bring out our first glass and disappear but he was wonderful and always checked in on us when we were running low. We ended up each getting 1 glass of prosecco pre appetizer/for the appetizer, 1 glass of Pinot noir for the appetizer/entree, 1 glass of Super Tuscan for the entree and 1 glass of prosecco again for the dessert (we skipped the Sauvignon Blanc). The super Tuscan was the best tasting and the pours were extremely generous.Decor:The restaurant is very nicely decorated (and changes each season), but I think the wine dinner is only served in the back room area, which is actually a little quieter so that was nice.Food:We got a cute watermelon stick amuse bouche to start, which was tasty.We shared the burrata and steak tartare as our appetizers, both were gluten free without the bread that came with it.The peaches that came with the burrata were perfect and the steak tartare had amazing flavor.We both ordered the duck for our main course. The duck was cooked to a nice medium rare and the skin was crispy. There were 2 duck breasts and duck prosciutto.The side of corn brûlée was amazing. The truffle fries were sadly not gluten free because of cross contamination, but for $18 I'm OK having not ordered them.For dessert, only the creme brûlée and ice cream/sorbets were gluten free. The brûlée was a little too lemony for my tastes and the spicy chocolate sorbet was just OK.If I was ordering for just myself I probably would've gotten the chocolate cube, but I was sharing with my boyfriend and I was stuffed at this point anyways so didn't want a full dessert to myself.Verdict:Overall, the service was fantastic, the food was well executed and the price is excellent.  The wine dinner is definitely the way to go!",1,1,1,Elyka A.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",198,204,634

And they were very nice about last-minute adds and drop-outs.The food ranged from just good to excellent. Standouts were the basil focaccia to start (it was so good, we kept on asking for more) and the avocado toast with raspberry hot sauce. The avocado toast was AMAZE, and the raspberry hot sauce was such an interesting, complex flavor (a dining companion loved it so much, the restaurant made one bottle for him to take him!

It was also topped with fresh raspberries which may sound odd but the sour-sweet was great with the crab. For my main course I chose the Lamb Shank with cornbread grits. I thought this dish was kind of bland and did not enjoy it as much. The lemon cream tart with blueberry frozen yogurt was eclectic and colorfully presented but tasted like any average lemon tart.

There was a bug in my water. The octopus was rubbery and the knife wasn't sharp enough to cut it. Half the menu items were unavailable. They didn't coordinate the wine with the dishes. It was like they weren't even trying to be a high end restaurant. The manager is a bimbo and wasn't understanding at all to the patrons.

4.0,3/26/2017,"4/5 StarsPark Avenue Autumn/Winter/Spring/Summer was a phenomenal experience. The restaurant's menu changes to reflect the current season. Last night's visit was the ""premiere"" of the spring menu, compelling me to initiate the documentation of my restaurant explorations! Everything pertaining to the restaurant reflected that of the spring theme: decor (lavender delicately overhanging the branches on trees above diners, trees with little delicate flowers, and vases of assorted flowers around the tables of patrons), smell (lavender scented set-ups placed strategically around the restaurant), centerpiece on table was of a birch and beautiful white flower) and even the drinks incorporated ingredients reminiscent of spring - light and sometimes flowery.I highly recommend the rabbit dish - not gamey at all with light, savory sauce to top off.  The crudo was extremely fresh and lightly seasoned, with a bit of Asian influence (soy), which reigns as my first or second favorite dish of the night (I couldn't decide). The other major competitor has to be the steak carppaccio; very thinly sliced, season with a bit of salt and fresh herbs. Their presentation for dessert is A+. They went above and beyond expectations with the nest-like base to present their chocolate forrest cake (signature dessert dish) - delish!!

3.0,3/5/2017,"This review is about as conflicted as they come.One of my very close friends is a huge foodie.  Every time she comes to New York, I have a mini panic attack about picking the restaurant we will dine at.  This past week, I was scouring OpenTable for a last minute reservation when I stumbled across the ""Park Avenue Winter Dinner Party"".  Party?  I'm there.The Park Avenue Winter Dinner Party specifically starts at ~9 each night and for $40pp before tax/tip, you get a glass of prosecco, hor d'oeuvres, an app, and an entree.  It sounded like a great deal, so we made our reservation for 9 and showed up on time.  There is a complimentary coat check in the front (which makes you feel comfortable because they don't even have a tip jar out) and our hostess was SUPER nice.  She explained how the night would work and led us to a small table in the front of the bar for the prosecco & hor d'oeuvres.  I must say, it was a little confusing how it worked, but the entire staff was very friendly/approachable.HORS D'OEUVRES:At the bar, there were plates of food out, but since it was packed they made us our own plate which was super cute.  It had mini latkes with caviar, little truffle balls, eggrolls, a crab-stuffed cone, and corndog ""lollipops"".  Of all of this, we liked the eggroll the best.  None of them really stood out, but it was a cute idea and held us over to our meal, being that it started after 9PM.Post snacks, the hostess came by and led us to our table.  Our server was nice and wasn't pushy on drinks or add-ons, which I liked.  The dining room area had an open layout and was gorgeous.  APPETIZERS:SEARED HAMACHI CRUDO: Served with almonds, grapes, and olives.  This was an interesting dish - three pieces of crudo with an interesting sort of tapenade.  We liked this; it didn't blow me away but it was enjoyable and a reasonable portion.LOCAL BURRATA: Served with persimmon ""alla puttanesca"".  I couldn't really tell what else was in this (some sort of crunchy fruit crouton?  Couldn't tell if this was also persimmon-based).  It's hard to dislike cheese but this dish fell flat for me.  The burrata had a kind of strange texture to it - but it's cheese so, eat it.ENTREES: SHORT RIB: Served with root vegetables.  Good, not great.  Most bang-for-your-buck portion, though - two large pieces, just not very flavorful.  We did not finish this.GREEN CIRCLE CHICKEN: Served with black garlic.  I think this was our favorite dish of the evening - lots of good/big flavors here, but a much smaller portion than the Short Rib.We didn't do dessert but I did order a glass of wine.  Our total bill came to just about $100 before tip.  It's hard to give a place like this - where the service was great, the atmosphere was awesome, and the event itself was very cool - three stars, but the truth of the matter was that I really just didn't love the food.  Aside from the chicken, I didn't think it was memorable.  I'm glad we tried it and I don't regret coming, but I would have been upset if I had paid full price for this meal. All in all, would recommend the event for a fun night out with reasonable food, but wouldn't recommend this place for a mind-blowing culinary experience.",2,2,0,Jenn P.,"Manhattan, NY",285,134,933
2.0,2/24/2017,"We had a family birthday dinner here last night, about two years after we were last there.  Overall, the food was about as good as it was two years ago -- more details below -- but I am taking away at least one star for the throbbing over-loud disco beat music.  We were in the beautifully decorated main dining room.  The LOUD LOUD LOUD disco beat music made dinner almost unpleasant at times and made it hard for our party of six to converse.  REALLY, this is supposed to be a fine-dining restaurant.  PLEASE Park Avenue Winter play less intrusive music and in general work on your acoustics so that people can talk.  Even during the brief pauses in between musical numbers, the noise level was brutal.  At this price-point, one should be able to relax and not leave with a headache.  We asked politely several times if the music could be lowered, to no avail.Food was very good.  Started with a truffle-gougere-ish amuse buche, and almost-muffin-like gingerbread-y bread.  Both very good.  I had the pumpkin ravioli appetizer, which was quite, quite tasty and the appetizer-size portion was generous ample.  In contrast, I felt as if the portion size of my duck entree was smallish.  It was delicious -- and mouth-wateringly tender -- but there were just 3 small chunks of duck breast.  They probably got portions for four diners out of one whole duck.  Others at the table enjoyed the brussels sprout salad, the branzino, the salmon, and I can't remember what the other person had.  The other entree portions seemed a shade small too, though.  The chocolate box dessert was delicious and the winter sundae was huge and very rich and good.5 entrees, 4 appetizers, 3 glasses of wine, some other beverages, and 3 desserts came to $462 with tax, pre-tip.  I wouldn't have begrudged the price if the ambiance were pleasant.  None of us are inclined to return.",1,2,0,Meg S.,"Manhattan, NY",3,137,0

5.0,2/16/2017,"This would be a Restaurant Week Winter 2017 review.  I came here with a couple friends for a 9 o'clock reservation.  We were promptly seated in a nice, quiet, semi-secluded area where the noise level allowed for easy conversion.We grabbed a couple drinks at the bar prior (very decent old fashioned), but stuck to the Restaurant Week wine special - a Nebbiolo that was really quite good for about $40 (got 3 bottles for 5 people during the course of the dinner - fun times!).We were first offered courtesy appetizers - gingerbread and a really tasty truffle...type thing (hadn't quite heard the description from our server)...probably still busy Yelping what dessert to get.  For my appetizer, I ordered the Peekytoe Crabcakes ($5 supplement) - all meat, no filler...just perfect! The citris, elderflower, jalapeno medley on the side brought a lot of freshness to the plate.I sampled my friends' pumpkin ravioli, oxtail orecchiette, and burrata - I would have been perfectly satisfied with any (though, if forced to choose...I would probably go oxtail)For my main, I got the short rib with roots & alliums. WOW. One of the most tender, succulent short ribs I've ever had. The portion size was also really quite large, and rather shocking for a Restaurant Week offering - at times I was nervous that dessert may prove difficult. I also tried my friend's mains (halibut w black truffle & brioche crusted egg - $10 supp and the pork loin) - all fine...but my god, those short ribs...On to dessert: We basically ordered and shared a bunch:The Cube ($5) - it may have been extra, but the cookies and cream ganache/filling was..omg. Fabulous.Take 5 Mousse (chocolate, caramel, peanut butter & pretzels) - My favorite candy bar in fancy, dainty form! This was great!Pear and Pomegranit Sorbet - really light, nice, sweet, freshing...everything sorbet should be! Sticky Toffee Gingerbread (secret ingredient of this RW?)

4.0,2/4/2017,"** Restaurant Week 2017 Review ** I have never been to Park Avenue before - any of the their seasonal renditions. When it came time to reserve our family's winter restaurant week dinner, I instantly knew we had to try Park Avenue Winter. We arrived a little early so waited inside near the bar. Once my sister arrived, we checked in and was seated right away. Unfortunately, I had not done my research and didn't know to specifically book the inside dining room so we were closer to the bar. It wasn't a big deal, but I would've liked to sit in the decorated dining room! After you order, they bring over some spiced Gingerbread and an amuse bouche of black truffle croquettes. I enjoyed the croquettes more than the gingerbread - but both were a nice start to our meal. To start, I went with the Pumpkin Ravioli with Hazelnuts, Pecorino, and Pickled Cranberries. I thoroughly enjoyed this dish - the pecorino was salty, the cranberries were tart, and the pumpkin itself was a little bit sweet. There was a nice balance of different flavors throughout the dish. For my entree, I had the Braised Short Ribs with Roots and Alliums. First of all, the portion size was super generous. There were two large pieces of short rib, which is more than a lot of other Restaurant Week menus I've had. The short ribs were moist, fell apart when forked, and super soft. I was actually super full by the time I finished my entree - my sister didn't finish hers! For dessert, we all ordered something different and shared them. We had the Sticky Toffee Gingerbread Pudding with Candied Lemon & Lemon Cream, the Pear & Pomegranate Sorbet with Wine -Soaked Figs, and their signature Park Avenue Chocolate Cube with Chocolate Ancho Sorbet ($5 supplement). I didn't quite like the Sticky Toffee Pudding, but really thoroughly love the Pear & Pomegranate Sorbet. It was the perfect combination of sweet and tart to end the otherwise savory meal. I also had their Cucumber Mule cocktail, which is a Restaurant Week special. It was really refreshing and I thoroughly enjoyed it. Service was attentive and our tables were cleared in a timely manner. I liked my dinner at Park Avenue Winter and would like to come back during another season to try their other menus.",2,0,1,Michelle T.,"New York, NY",367,1165,1125

Two slices of grilled Branzino fish (visibly microwaved) with some garnish on the side. There was no intention of making this dish appetizing. No citrus sauce or any type of culinary effort was put into creating this dish.

4.0,1/26/2017,"Had a wonderful time at Park Ave AWSS for restaurant week!First, the décor is charming, whimsical and elegant. Gives a great first impression as you enter the dining area. Shortly after we were seated, the waiter brought us black truffle potato balls (yum!) and ginger bread with creamed butter. Great way to tide over ones appetite while you read the menu. Restaurant week prices are a great deal! $42 for three course meal - and enough choices to satisfy everyone's taste buds. I started with the pumpkin ravioli sprinkled with walnuts and pickled cranberries. The pasta was perfectly al dente and the cranberries gave a perfect 'pop!' of tangy freshness. Ordered the branzino with citrus and fennel for entree. The skin was crisp, the fish was flaky, and the citrus was a bright complement to the white fish. For dinner I had the gingerbread with candied lemons and dallop of vanilla ice cream. Obviously I was on a fruit/citrus kick. Overall, great food and a leisurely dining experience.

4.0,1/19/2017,"When I initially wrote this review roughly two years ago, I found Park Avenue Winter to be one of the best NYC Restaurant Week deals available. After looking at their 2017 restaurant week menu I am confident that that will again be the case this year (note: it runs from January 23 to February 10). I say that because a) I already know that that the food at Park Ave is quality and would, if not for Restaurant Week, be more expensive, and b) their 2017 menu does not commit the two most aggravating Restaurant Week sins: extremely restricted menu choices and ubiquitous supplemental charges. The menu includes many dishes from their traditional menu, and from my experience portion sizes are not skimpy. It is incredibly frustrating to me when a restaurant participates only to offer one or two options created specifically for the deal (i.e. you can't order any of the dishes you read about that made you want to come to the restaurant in the first place). Furthermore, while supplemental charges are appropriate for special items with particularly pricey ingredients, the purpose of Restaurant Week is defeated when there is a supplement for the majority of the menu choices.Thank you for bearing with my Restaurant Week rant.The AvroKo designed decor is clever and constantly changing, as the restaurant is transformed according to the current season along with the name of the restaurant (i.e. Park Avenue Winter/Spring/Summer/Autumn). Thus, the seasonally-adapted interior allows you to return to a refreshed dining experience every few months. The bar area is just the right size and has just the right feel, and the friendly bartender served me a his take on a Manhattan. Service in the dining room was also excellent.Some of the dishes at Park Ave were more ""good"" than ""great"" (e.g. Seared Scallop Sandwich and Pistachio Sundae), but as I look at the 2017 menu it appears these have been removed anyway. I enjoyed the Short Rib and Winter White Sundae, and would be excited to return back and sample other dishes, including the wild ""Broccoli & Cheetos"" combination.",2,0,2,Alex S.,"New York, NY",20,91,54
5.0,1/10/2017,"I was accompanied by 6 of my friends at Park Avenue Winter to celebrate my 30th birthday. One of my friends did extensive research to find the perfect spot and came across this gem. We made reservations for the park avenue dinner party. The general ambiance was perfect. Bare tree branches carefully arranged throughout the dining room contrasted beautifully with the sea of white tables, brightened softly with golden lights. The service was incredible! The manager of the restaurant greeted us warmly and everyone was so friendly. The waiters were attentive and patient with our group. With the dinner party, you are started with a flute of sparkling prosecco and hors d'oeuvres which our group devoured. The food was absolutely delicious! Our group was so enamored with our appetizers, entrees, and yes desserts - that  parts of our conversation were flooded with, ""wow's"" and ""oh my God's"" throughout our meal. The menu was diverse- and all of us - dietary restrictions and all- found a dish that we were excited to try. I chose the pumpkin ravioli as my appetizer- I appreciated the sweet/ sour contrast of the pickled cranberries with the earthiness of the pumpkin ravioli. I had the short rib as my entree which was savory,  well cooked, and melted in my mouth. The roots that accompanied the dish were delicious and well seasoned, creating an overall sense of comfort perfect for a cold winter night. And though we were full and content, we opted to indulge in dessert, and we were not disappointed!Going out with a group affords you the opportunity to play dessert roulette, where you can try a bite of it all and pass it down. My friend took a bite of the winter sundae, which you would assume would be an odd choice for a cold day. But it was light and minty, and as she described, ""tastes like winter"". The fruit tartlets had a tangy lemon filling which was refreshing. The waiter came out with a specially ordered park avenue cube and candle as I was serenaded by my friends with ""happy birthday!"". It was rich, chocolatey, and probably one of the best desserts I have ever had. Overall an amazing experience and a steal at the price! I have already recommended this restaurant to my friends and while it's so difficult to return to restaurants in New York as there is always something new and exciting to try, I can safely say I will be back for spring (and all of the other seasons)",2,0,0,Nilam W.,"Manhattan, NY",134,7,1

4.0,12/28/2016,"Great brunch, teensy lunchI've been to Park Avenue about 4 times now, all in 2016, and have had a really positive experience each time. Each meal has been a two-top, me and a friend.  First, I want to say that for brunch, the restaurant offers a really enjoyable experience and a reasonably priced one, for what you're receiving. Topnotch service, elegant space, delicious entrees - primarily, I can recommend the pistachio encrusted branzino, but I also ventured into something more brunchy, an eggs bennie variant I think.  In the summertime, since Manhattan empties out so much, my friend and I usually had the nice corner banquette tables. So I was surprised, on my latest venture to the café, to have to report that a midweek lunch is not quite so successful. Perhaps it's the Café's winter incarnation, and an assumption that in winter, we are all tightening our belt? The service was excellent as always, and the food I did have - in my case, lobster salad, in my friend's, the branzino - was excellent too. What was the baffling misfire were the portions.  Politely speaking, our plates - and all those going by, as well - were nouveau, or to the point, quite insufficient!  My $30 lobster salad, and her $30 branzino - unadorned by any sides - were ""starter"" size.  It was truly mysterious.  I don't expect mountains of lobster, but where did the farro and arugula go? To compensate, we ordered a couple of ""for the table"" dishes - brussels sprouts with bacon and latkes, both of which were great. However, we were puzzled by the restaurant's choice to put its diners on an unrequested reducing regime. I do understand some diners enjoy a light lunch, such as if you're working.  The prices were just not appropriate to the miniscule servings. I will return, but perhaps confine myself to brunch!",2,1,0,Kate J.,"Manhattan, NY",0,33,0

Not only does the food change from season to season, to include the main dishes as well as the drinks and deserts but so does the decor.In saying that what I can share is this. Not being a big drinker, I always order at least one of the cocktails. As much as the food, a lot of thought goes into the design of the drink and they are always well balanced. The apps, entrees, and deserts to are consistent in one way from season to season and that is that they are always delicious. The serving size is just right where you get a good sample of the flavor and texture of the dish but allows you to order a few courses without feeling overly stuffed. Speaking of flavor and texture the chefs at Park do great job of keeping them interesting and complimentary to each other, knowing when to add a bit of citrus to liven up a dish or a pinch of salt to bring out the savory of a another.Finally, the staff are always top notch.

2.0,12/6/2016,"Came here 12/3/16 (Saturday night) for a bachelorette dinner (group of about 12 women).SEATED VERY LATE: The friend who coordinated the outing had a reservation at 8:00 pm. We all arrived on time. However we had to wait 45 minutes before we were seated! We were offered champagne while waited, which was nice, but I think we would rather have been seated in a timely fashion. Plus gratis champagne was not helpful to the (at least) two pregnant friends in the group, and I didn't see any substitution offered.When we sat down, we were offered menus relatively quickly. But the wine list and cocktail menu came around like 30 minutes later! So strange.FOOD: The pumpkin ravioli appetizer that I had was delicious. So was the chocolate cube dessert, amazing! But the sea scallops entree was not very enjoyable - the scallops were quite overcooked.There were lots of complimentary offerings during each course of the meal (again to help make up for the uber late seating time). The brocolli Cheetos side during dinner was surprisingly tasty! But I was so full from my other dishes that I could only enjoy so much ""extra"". I didn't even touch the bonus desserts.SERVICE: Our main server was friendly and attentive. The gentlemen who served the different dishes were a bit hard to understand, though, when they were explaining what they were setting down on the table.At one point a champagne glass fell down (seemed to be b/c of uneven table surface, not anyone being inebriated). And I found it crazy how long it took for anyone to come around and properly clean the area and remove the broken glass. When the glass fell, I felt some liquid flicker my way, so I suspected that the shards of glass may not be too far off. I ate the rest of my meal with my fingers mentally crossed.OVERALL: I think this place was either having a REALLY off night (given all the other rave reviews) or it's just not very good for groups larger than 4 or maybe 6.Yes the decor is cool and it's interesting how they change it up, along with the menus, each season. But on this night that didn't make up for the poor overall service and not-so-great food.

5.0,11/26/2016,"Beautiful decor, great menu selection, fantastic service, and delicious food!Recommend for dates, fancy family dinners, and girls' nights out!Love love love the decor of Park Avenue. We visited while the restaurant was in Park Avenue Autumn mode. For those who have never visited, the restaurant completely revamps its interior decor and menu for each season. There is a large ""tree"" in the middle of the restaurant, whose foliage will change according to the season. The rest of the restaurant decor as well as the server uniforms will also change. During Park Avenue Autumn, the servers wear red flannel shirts and there are adorable lights hanging from the orange leaved branches of the tree. The whole restaurant is dimly lit and very romantic. The boyfriend and I had an early date night, and when we were seated at 6 PM, the restaurant was sparsely filled with patrons, mostly of older ages. The restaurant filled up exponentially as our night went on.I recommend the Apple Martini and the Hot Toddy for drinks- both very seasonal and deliciously made. We were given a few complimentary starters- apple spheres dipped in maple butter and toffee(?) and bread with maple butter. Both delicious. Between the two of us, we decided one of us would get the prix fixe dinner and the other would order an individual entree. For our appetizer, we chose the Pumpkin Ravioli, though we both really wanted the Autumn Haystack as well. The Pumpkin Ravioli was great, but we both agreed that the Autumn Haystack would have been more exciting to try. The boyfriend's Red Wattle Pork Schnitzel was so tender and savory! The crusting was perfect. I chose half scallops and half Lobster & Lobster. The scallops were just perfect. I tried to make the dish last as long as I could. The Lobster and Lobster dish was a tender Lobster tail de-shelled for convenience. For dessert, we enjoyed a refreshing Panna Cotta with the most delicious Crème Fraiche and a yummy Cappuccino. I can't wait to revisit Park Avenue. Now that winter's rolling around, I'm sure Park Avenue Winter will be an experience to be had! Thank you for such a wonderful date night!",1,0,0,Rosa C.,"New York, NY",85,320,122

2.0,11/20/2016,"We had been to Park Avenue Autumn several times at its previous location and always enjoyed our experience. So, we were very much looking forward to our evening here.The old place was great for a quiet evening to enjoy a great meal in a gorgeous space. The new place is large, noisy and jammed with large groups. If I wanted to go out for dinner with 6 or more people in an evening that started at the bar and morphed into a table dinner, this place could work. For a quiet, romantic, special occasion dinner for 2, I would never return here.When you walk in, you enter through a large bar area, with more bar tables in an adjoining room. So, by definition, it is a loud room. The main restaurant is in the back, with many of the tables geared toward accommodating large groups. In terms of the menu, it is fairly limited. So, I would advise checking their website before going. My starter, the hamachi, would be better defined as an ""amuse"" rather than a full order in terms of portion size. The entree that I selected off the menu turned out to not be available.  (yet, the waiter only told me this upon delivering me my starter and after making my wine selection). I ended up ordering a special, that was an uninspired fish entree that was wildly over-priced at $55.  The wine list is average. I see no reason to return to this establishment again. Nothing was memorable, price was high for the quality and experience, wine list was average, room was loud. Maybe we were expecting it to be more like the old location.",0,0,0,H K.,"Manhattan, NY",0,20,0

My boyfriend and I were the first to arrive and were given the option to wait at the bar or be seated and we were promptly seated in a cozy booth. We all really liked the ambiance and decor. One of the speciality drinks we wanted to order was sold out but the waiter found a small tasting portion to bring out which was really nice. Three of us tried the 4 course tasting ($79/pp) and one person only ordered an entree and dessert. The difference between the tasting menu scallops and full entree is one additional scallop!! I think they could have done better. Taste was nice but I've certainly had better. between our group we tried the foie-gras, scallops, halibut, duck, brussel sprouts, panna cotta and more.

Especially after raving about it and being so eager to go for years, I felt embarrassed for having even suggested it.First of all, we had a reservation for 7:30. We arrived promptly only to be told that the table wasn't ready and to have a drink at the bar. So we made out way to an over crowded bar where we couldn't even get a drink or a seat if we wanted to. So we just stood off to the side and waited. After 30 minutes we were finally escorted to a table, and happened to pass several available and empty tables.Upon sitting down it took another 15 minutes to get water... and 30 minutes to get the wine we ordered. Then we had to flag down a random person to order food. Then the table next to us sat down and the waiter started telling them the specials. My date and I were surprised to hear that because we didn't even know there were specials. I ordered the lobster and it was slightly raw and cold. Either way, I wouldn't recommend it.

3.0,10/23/2016,"This restaurant is gorgeous, with wonderful service and everything gorgeously plated.$35 brunch prix-fixe: we shared the squash & crab toast; pancakes & schnitzel.  To start, I had a cider bellini.  I could hardly drink it because it was BITTER.  Weird for a Bellini...They bring out 'monkey bread', which is very sweet bread, with sweet golden raisins and pecans.The squash and crab exceeded my expectations- they were delicious.  The pancakes weren't very 'berry'- they also had a bitter aftertaste, but were very sweet, even without the syrup.  The schnitzel tasted like the schnitzel-version of mu shu pork.  Which, really isn't a complaint- just an observation.  All in all, I was struck by the seasonal beauty of the decor of the restaurant, as well as the plates themselves.  As for dining, the tables are so close together that we basically dined with the trying-too-hard first date to my left, and three single girls to my right, commiserating on 'how exhausting dating is'.  The food was way too sweet for my palate.  The one 'sweet' drink I expected came out bitter.  I don't think I'd be back for a PF.",0,0,0,Heather W.,"Manhattan, NY",44,418,1108

They seated us in a nice space that is more quiet & where were close to the wall with nice decor. First we got our drink. All of us got a cocktail drink. My drink is pretty strong. Its called swan dive $16- sparking rosé, giffard pamplemousse, grapefruit slice. It taste good to me because I like the bitter taste of it but my bf doesn't like it. If you're into grapefruit then you might like this drink. All of us enjoyed our drinks. For appetizer I decided to order from the restaurant week menu. For appetizer I got the local burrata- peach salsa verde & basil panzanella. Peach makes it sweet & the cheese taste okay. This is a okay appetizer. My bf mom got the softshell crab & I took a bite of it, its crispy & yummy. So I recommend to get that intead of local burrata. For main dish I got the red wattle pork loin- guanciale cornbread grits & peaches. The meat is dry & again that fruity sweet taste of peach. I got peach for appetizer & peach for main dish. For dessert I got the bases loaded- chocolate, peanut butter, pretzels, chips & beer. This dessert is delicious! All in all, it was a okay dinner. I was not impressed.

3.0,8/22/2016,"A prix fixe lunch at Park Avenue Summer for New York City Restaurant Week moved more quickly than desired; we were rushed through our meal, despite our attempts to slow it down and enjoy our time appropriately. The cornbread was puffy, fashioned like Madeleines, but there was a hint of savory heightened by the spicy marbled compound butter. Burrata rested on top of a smear of salsa verde, which was bright but not quite right--something did not quite mingle for me here, but the panzanella added texture to the prix fixe starter. Despite their slightly crunchy exterior, the gnocchi were heavy on the inside, the potato flavor pronounced. Black truffles were shaved at the table, adding another layer to the appetizer. There were pieces of corn swimming in a sauce that was sweet but also tangy. This too felt like too much zing for the decadence of the gnocchi and truffle.    The branzino was pretty, but just enough-- two slender steaks of fish with disks of firm summer squash and dots of saffron aioli. A shallow pool of stewed vegetable ratatouille gave warmth without an expected heaviness. The components came together really well and tasted finished. Just four succulent scallops was accompanied by tiny pickled peppers and corn felt raw and tasted green. There was a toothy bite from the golden corn and little heat from thin wheels of peppers.  Salt clung to the sweet scallops, but in the end, I wished there was a little more something there.The peach basil sorbet dessert housed disappointing honey poached peaches which were reminiscent of those in canned pie filling-- saccharine to excess. The fruit tart was pretty as a picture, a collection of summer's berry bounty. It tasted like summer should.Like the seasons, the dishes and pace were imbalanced. We were forced to blow through our food, and waiting dishes turned cold as we tried to relish and savor.

Minor issue but it was confusing and felt like an oversight.Consider the prix fix option (it was $79 for an Appetizer and two entrees and dessert) the entrees are smaller portioned so two is appropriate.The food is amazing and redeems this place for sure.

Everything was just stunning and elegant. We got seated at a big circular table in the middle of the restaurant for our group of 9. There is a $32 prix fix menu for brunch that includes pasty (warm cinnamon rolls), an appetizer and a main course. There was a good variety of dishes to choose from. I definitely had a hard time deciding because everything looked delicious!I was a big fan of the* Breakfast risotto (mushrooms sausage and bacon with an egg on top)* Smoked Salmon Bucatini - the flavors in this dish were amazing! * Oats & Almonds (coconut and chocolate sprinkled on top) that was so refreshing. * The Crusted Branzino. Probably one of the best upscale fish dish I've had dining out. It had a crusted exterior but perfectly cooked and moist interior with cream cheese under that was beautifully presented.  Every dish was great! We played games during the bridal shower and opened presents. We ended up staying more than 3 hours but the staff never once rushed us or told us to leave.

The RW menu was interesting and reflected their regular price menu (unlike some other places). The food here is exceptional; from the visually stunning execution to the unique flavor pairings, the overall eating experience here is fantastic.  I loved my strawberry gazpacho soup, fish, and dessert. My friend ordered the corn gnocchi which was delicious.I've since come back and ordered from the regular menu. I had a few options in mind, but the waitress really recommend the burgers. I like burgers but rarely order them at restaurants because I like to try foods I wouldn't cook for myself.  The burgers with their sauce and cucumbers are delicious and refreshing for these hot summer months.  Plus you get TWO burgers nestled together like two cute peas in a pod.  Since I've only come for lunch, I've only tried the froze (which is a must) but the cocktail menu has some quirky names like ""The Butterfly Stroke"" made with tequila (which I can really identify with as swimmer because I NEED tequila after doing a set of that stroke).  I really want to come back and try the cocktail menu when I'm not going back to work after my meal.I definitely recommend Park Ave for anyone that loves good food and wants something nicer and more unique without the kitschy + hipster approach to dining.

Our waiter was so nice she even brought us little sample cups to try it before we ordered it.

They brought out the bowl with all the ingredients and poured out the soup right in front of you. Corn gnocchi was really packed with flavor. They even grate as much truffle as you want (first time I've seen a real piece of truffle!) It was also a decent size for an appetizer.The grilled bavette was perfect at medium-rare and the branzino was a good choice after the gnocchi. However, the presentation threw me off with large pieces of greens covering my fish. But it was still delicious!For dessert, I got the fruit tart (great taste, fresh berries) while the bf got bases loaded (full of chocolaty goodness). It really was overwhelming but great for those with a sweet-tooth. My only complaint was that the pretzels on top were a bit mushy. However, it was probably prepared in advance and placed in the fridge which is understandable.Overall, this is an impressive place to bring a date.

2.0,8/11/2016,"We had lunch here a few weeks ago. The decor for summer is bright, sunny and pleasant. Fresh flowers, and greens everywhere. I had the Stonefruit Sangria and it was one of the most delicious summer drinks I've had in ages. The food however was a let down. I'm sure this place used to be excellent at one point...and if they paid a little more attention to their food, it would be excellent again. The flavors did not marry well in the ricotta cavatelli that I ordered. It wasn't bad... just meh. My lunch date had the same experience with the food - he had the King Salmon. I had higher expectations from this place so I'm a little disappointed.",0,0,0,Jinal S.,"Manhattan, NY",253,62,0
5.0,8/9/2016,"Woot Woot!! Thumbs up to Park avenue summer! We went for the restaurant week, tried their gazpacho, gnocchi, branzino, bavette, tart and bases loaded.Everything was great but the best parts were Gonocchi, Branzino and Bavette! Even though gonocchi was the appetizer, it was a decent amount of food as an appetizer. Also Branzino was moist inside, crispy outside and went well with their tomato sauce. We also ordered Bavette as medium rare and it came out perfectly cooked for medium rare and seasoning was on point!We also tried their Frosè and fell in love with it!

I'm not sure if it was just because it RW or Troy the bartender ( your welcome) but it was filled with women of all ages. 17-2 ratio at one time. The front desk staff was very nice and general manager Danielle was very attentive.  Dining room is light and airy filled with beautiful NY crowd. After we sat down everything changed. Not sure why but our waiter was horrible , not friendly ,  not sure he was listening to us, wanted to run up the bill, I think he even gave us the stink eye.   Oh and the food. We were not there for RW so we had 4apps, 3 main courses. ordered sides and 3 desserts. Shared everything. Everything was good. No complaints  but Nothing outstanding except the corn Creme brûlée.

The corn gnocchi and salmon were my favorites off the RW menu. I'm still having dreams about that corn and truffle combination.Service was amazing - they were so attentive, but not in an annoying way.

They've changed some of the classic dishes, and while I usually eat every last bite because everything is so good, there was nothing incredible this time. In addition, the service was lacking. We were rushed at the beginning, the waiter made a huge deal over my request for plain butter for the bread, and then the waiter disappeared for 45 minutes in the middle of the meal. I had to ask three different people to fill up my tiny water glass (and I had to ask multiple times). I don't think the meal was worth the cost of Restaurant Week, and I probably won't come back for regular priced dining. Time to discover another favorite!P.S.

3.0,7/31/2016,"I should have known that something was wrong when I walked into a restaurant that was over half empty during prime brunch time. Park Avenue Summer offers an extremely promising $32 prix fixe brunch (complimentary pastry, appetizer, and main) in a beautiful setting. This is the type of spacious, classy restaurant that you'd want to bring your family to. Sadly, it did not live up to its hype.The ONLY redeeming quality about this restaurant is the unlimited monkey bread (otherwise known as a cinnamon bun) that came with complimentary condensed milk and nuts. Honestly, if it weren't for this unlimited bread that actually tasted delicious and was incredibly addicting, this restaurant wouldn't even get a 3-star review.For my appetizer, I had the crab and avocado toast, and for my main, I had the ricotta cavatelli. While everything sounded promising on paper, the food itself just tasted so mediocre. The crab was very heavily covered in a mayo sauce. Normally, I love avocado toast, but this was just too heavy to handle. The ricotta cavatelli was the most basic tomato sauce over pasta dish I have ever seen. It tasted fine but definitely not worth the price. For $32, Park Ave Summer definitely made me feel very full, yet I was also just so unsatisfied.

5.0,7/25/2016,"I'm pretty sure something historic happened here at Park Avenue.It was here that I had the best pasta of my life.  The strange thing is that I didn't see it coming because it's not an Italian place.  It was the one pasta dish on the menu that looked good, so my daughter ordered it.  I'm still regretting the fact that it wasn't ME who ordered it.  Luckily my daughter filled up early and let me finish her dish, and let me tell you, the pleasure was all mine.The decor inside will win you over instantly.  They have this tree in the middle of the dining room, there are lots of windows with light pouring in.  Perfect place for lunch in the middle of NYC.  STEAK & FRITES (4/5)  This was an enjoyable dish, but unfortunately the steak was over-cooked.  The fries were good, shoe-string w/parmesan and they might have even been ""truffled"", I forget.RICOTTA CAVATELLI (5/5) Best pasta I've e!ver had.  I can't believe I'm writing that.  OK, well, my Italian Auntie Connie's Fetticine w/Stuffed Lobster is unbeatable, but beside that, the best pasta.  The ricotta was fresh, and was strategically placed it little clumps throughout the dish.  There were sweet, fresh cherry tomatoes that tasted like they were picked fresh from the sunny garden.  The pasta tasted house-made, and there was some kind of spice kick to the dish. I forgot to ask the server what it was that made the dish spicy, but whatever it was, it was the perfect kind, and level of spice.  Here's the bad news though.  They are a seasonal restaurant as reflected in the name of their restaurant Park Avenue Autumn/Winter/Spring/Summer.  So their menu completely changes with each season which means I won't be able to get that dish again.  Unless they do it again next summer which is probably not going to happen.  Which means, I'm going to have to create this at home, and I'm inspired enough to do it.KING SALMON W/DILL (5/5) My wife's dish.  I tasted and was very happy.  Perfectly cooked, flavorful salmon with the fresh dill.  Light and refreshing - great summer menu item.CRAB AVOCADO W/TOAST (5/5) Another standout.  Slight char on the toast, with that fresh avocado and then luscious crab meat on top.  Then, if that weren't enough, they serve it with a spicy raspberry hot sauce which came as a nice surprise.  They actually had a bottle of it on the table which they make!  Looked just like a bottle of tabasco, but it was their little creation and I have to say, it was a great addition to the Avocado Toast.  Kudos to the chef.CORN CREME BRULEE (5/5) This is a *savory"" creme brulee. If you like corn, and you're a creme brulee fan, you have to get this.  You may not recover though, it's like crack, and you may have to go to rehab when you suffer withdrawals.  This dish takes corn to its highest level.  It's like on those cooking shows where they give the contestants an ingredient, and say make it the star of the dish.  This is the ultimate corn dish.  LOVED it.It's not often that you walk away from a restaurant where everything on the table was 5/5.  But Park Ave was one of those places.  When I taste food like this, it makes me want to meet the chef, or better yet, I'd love to spend a day in his/her kitchen to watch the magic happen.When we come back to NYC, I can guarantee you that we will have a reservation for this place set up well before we even arrive to the city.  I don't care what season it will be when we come.  I'm confident, based on what we experienced here, that those dishes will be equally great.",5,3,4,Darien R.,"Milpitas, CA",777,738,465
5.0,7/24/2016,"I really adore this place.When I first moved to New York in 2007, this place was near Midtown East, and my experiences there were magical. The seasonality of the menu, plus the environment was incredible because I had never seen a restaurant like that. The menu was always classic yet quirky (guess that's what ""New American"" is), but always beautifully executed and the staff were always exceptional. Fast forward to this past weekend in 2016, and, Melody C. and another friend joined me for brunch there -- now at it's newer location near Flatiron (but of course, on Park Avenue). The prix fixe, which includes a DIY Monkey Bread dish, appetizer, and entree for $32 is a perfect deal. You really can't put a price on the ambiance, which is both whimsical and romantic at the same time. Mel got the gaspacho, which was incredibly refreshing and light (if you've ever had gaspacho that was too seasoned and honestly, too ""tomatoey, you know what I mean), while my other friend go the Hamachi crudo (super refreshing). I got the smoked salmon bucatini, which was perfection. It came garnished with wasabi caviar, and the texture against the cream was awesome. Entrees were Steak and Eggs, and the Everything-Crusted Branzino. I know one of the other reviewers said that their Branzino has too hard of a crust, but it looks like they either improved on it or that chef left. This was perfectly seasoned and the crust was crispy without having too much resistance. Service was also awesome. We all loved our waiter, who was lighthearted and friendly. Also, if you get the white basil tea, note that the basil is very subtle -- the white tea flavor is most dominant.",1,0,1,Lily L.,"New York, NY",332,260,59

The hot sauce is served in a bottle that you can pour on your own.

I enjoy a blend of flavors - and even though I was worried about the cream cheese, it was quite subtle - actually not noticeable which i was pleased with. It's not salty or heavy (much appreciated after devouring the starters). Dessert:Warm Farm Fresh Berry Crostata Shortbread Crumble, Verbena Ice CreamAs a health nut/sweet tooth hybrid, I think this was my favorite dish - had all the ingredients to satisfy my sugar craving, berry craving, crumble craving, and ice cream craving.

The quality of food, service and general dining atmosphere has always been consistently wonderful. Last night was no exception.Somehow I have never managed to make it for the spring menu--I've enjoyed summer, autumn and winter multiple times and FINALLY got to check out spring. Everything was delicious, as usual.The amuse bouche was really cute, a mushroom arancini of sorts, ""planted"" in a bed of ""dirt"". The bread was a delicious concoction of parsley, rosemary, onion and sea salt. The cocktails were creative and spring themed and refreshing.We tried the $79 ""tasting"" menu, which is a pretty good deal per person as you each get a choice of appetizer, two entrees, and dessert. They say you get smaller portions but some of them seemed regular sized to me. We started with the Beets and Bobs salad, which I wish I could recreate at home. Refreshing and tasty, it had different types of beets, hazlenuts, and a delicious goat cheese. We also had the sheep's milk cavatelli with lamb; it was a generous portion for a tasting menu.Entrees were lobster, scallops, rabbit Wellington and lamb chops. We couldn't finish it all due to the generosity of the portions. They really know how to prepare scallops--I've never had anything less than a perfect scallop here. It's hard to pick a favorite because everything was top notch.Desserts were totally full sized; the chocolate cube is always a favorite, and the passionfruit berry tart was sublime.Engaging service and a beautiful spring atmosphere made this a perfect date night.

2.0,5/2/2016,"I've been going to Park Avenue Spring/Summer/Autumn/Winter for several years....I usually love my experience dining here, but this Spring was just all wrong.  The entire dinner experience felt like my boyfriend and I were dining at a big corporate chain restaurant. Did the restaurant change management or owners? After being seated, we waited a good 15-20 minutes before even receiving a menu. I tried waving down and calling out ""excuse me"" to a few people before I got someone's actual attention. The first guy, some chubby guy in a suit, who I imagined to be some type of ""manager"" - he was even looking in my direction but decided to check his phone that was hidden in an inside pocket in his blazer. I don't think that's fine dining etiquette - to ignore customers and play on your phone during peak dinner rush.I tried getting the attention of bus boys, but they were too busy resetting the tables carelessly - clanking glasses, literally throwing glass dishes down on the table without any attention or care. OK, fine. NEXT I finally had to call out loudly for another ""manager"" lady to come by. She was apologetic and sent over a free round of drinks, OK thanks. So that was the first 20 minutes of my experience at Park Avenue Spring. That really sets the tone for the rest of my night there. Let's just say the food was bland and boring - tasted like it came from a chain restaurant. I don't know who the chef was who was working that night but they should be ashamed to let that kind of food leave their kitchen. Also, our server, was a nice man, but a terrible server. Just not fine dining. Not even OK dining in my opinion. He should be working at a TGIFridays with that other scmuck of a server I had from Black Barn restaurant.Note to restaurant management - I know hiring good people is hard. But imagine how hard it is to recoup lost sales when people are fed up with the bad service they receive after paying $35 for a bland, underwhelming entree and decide not to eat at your restaurant anymore? It's in the best interest of everybody involved to hire a kitchen and wait staff that actually cares about the quality and integrity of the food and service that high end restaurants should be providing.

We were in a private room for an event, but the ambiance in general seemed great.Food:The table was provide with tasty warm cinnamon monkey rolls. It was crunchy on the exterior, yet soft and fluffy on the inside. Though no longer warm because it was place out while the group was socializing at first, I would still give it a high rating. Plus the cream cheese frosting and candied pecans were great.We ordered from a choice of 3 options for a starter, main entree, and dessert.I ordered Peekytoe Crab and avocado toast as my starter - it was fantastic. The crab was fresh and a little sweet, paired with creamy avocado and crunchy toast.For the entree, I ordered bacon, egg & cheeseburger. It had a delicious sauce (some sort of chipotle mayo I believe), and it came with a perfectly fried hash brown. However, the cheeseburger was a little well-done for my taste.For dessert, I ordered a spring berry and passion fruit tart. The tart was way too sweet for me, but I don't eat too many sweets in general.Service was fantastic, they came by to pour water and beverages often. The food in general was good (some hits) and some mild disappointment. Come try out the peekytoe crab and avocado toast and soak in a great environment, especially as it changes from season to season.Added picture",0,0,0,Alexander W.,"New Orleans, LA",566,185,156
5.0,4/1/2016,"What a delightful evening! I made reservations to have dinner with important associates on Saturday the 19th. I have been extremely busy with work or else I would have reviewed sooner. It was an impeccable dining experience, from the well crafted drinks at the bar: I had the re-gift Spritz. I loved it so much I remembered the name. I had the scallop crudo, it was light and delicious and the complementary Rosemary hot buns were the perfect way to travel between courses. I also enjoyed the oxtail orecetti and the MushroomEgg rolls.What made my night, though, was the service. Lisa and Elise were informative and kind. They made my guest feel comfortable and well taken care of which made me look amazing.Park avenue nails it with food as well as service.

Our waiter recommended a bottle of wine for us, which we loved. However he seemed to be rushing a bit throughout our meal. We ordered the octopus appetizer and it was rather small and in our opinion a little over-cooked on the grill. My step mother and I both got the Crab and Pansotti entree which was a small portion but in our opinion just the right amount of food. And it was delicious! However, my father got the sirloin and ordered it medium rare and it came out very rare. Since he was very hungry and doesn't typically mind the rare temperature, he ate it anyway but was less than impressed with how tough the steak was.

Ugh. Really really really good. I was hungry so We ordered a side of fries, they looked good and crispy but I will say it was obviously a silly simple order that was soggy and I should just stuck w the delicious gutOrder the prix fix, the sizes of the entrees and apps included in the prix fix are not that much smaller than the regular.So go w the prix fix.The scallops were great w the marrow leeks.

If i am expected to pay over a certain amount to dine, I expect the experience.The food was not good at all. We ordered the mushroom rolls and they were as small as your pinky and not thoroughly cooked through.For dinner we had the pumpkin ravioli (3 big raviolis) to an order but they weren't even stuffed so it was just dough on the plate. The beef shank was extremely salty and the fish was under cooked. If you are expected to pay $40 for an entree it better be worth it.

It took a very long time for us to get our table, almost 20 minutes after our scheduled reservation time. Then when we finally were seated, we waited perhaps a further 15 before we were even acknowledged by our waiter. I ordered burnt toast, branzino, and the famous Park Avenue cube. The food was actually quite good. The burnt toast was nicely crisp and sweet. The branzino was tender, but somewhat small. I never got to taste the cube unfortunately, because apparently it was no longer in stock, so I had to sub another unremarkable dessert for it. I believe it was toffee?

2.0,3/20/2016,"I came here to celebrate my friend's birthday as she raved about it, boasting that it was perhaps one of the best NYC restaurants that she has been to. I walked in with high expectations and was excited to try Park Avenue Winter. I was grossly disappointed. I made a reservation through Open Table, added notes that it's my friend's birthday and requested for a corner table as well as a mini dessert with a candle at the end of the meal to acknowledge her birthday. I also called the day of the reservation and spoke with Laura. She confirmed that it was in the notes and that it is all taken care of.Upon arrival, host was congenial, read the notes of the reservation, chuckled (so I know that he saw that it was someone's birthday) and had us seated. It was great how we were seated at a corner booth table. Waiter was nice, but not impressionable. We ordered crab cakes, pumpkin ravioli, braised short rib, miso glazed brussels sprouts, and Park Avenue potato latkes. Unfortunately, the crab cakes was probably the best dish aside from the fresh bread out of everything we ordered. The pumpkin ravioli had more dough than stuffing and it was a bit bland. The short rib was definitely drenched in sodium; it was gross. The brussels sprouts were also extremely salty. Is this a trend nowadays? Excessively adding sodium to food to show the lack of competence in chefs? The whole meal just missed the mark. Potato latke was just okay - it was like flat tater tots. Time for dessert. Here I am expecting a candle in some sort of pastry so that we can celebrate. Nope. Ordered the chocolate cube and it's an interesting concept, but was meh, as was the rest of the meal. Didn't have my hopes up for that. The ice cream was extremely thick and rich, with a cayenne pepper kick. The dessert itself is heavy and inside the cube was something along the lines of mousse mixed with pieces of chocolate cake. What frustrated me was the busboy avoided our table and did not fill up our water once we ordered dessert. Normally it's not a big deal but we need to replenish our bodies considering we consumed over 200% of our daily intake of sodium.Waiter didn't say thank you when handing us the check, and honestly, he didn't deserve any tip. I tipped him anyway - hope he learns that manners go a long way.This restaurant had 1 task. I just wanted to celebrate my friend's birthday and hoped that the restaurant's staff can communicate this throughout their team. Unfortunately not. -1 star for food, minus another one for service, and subtract another one for forgetting. I suppose I'll rate this restaurant 2 stars since it had a nice ambience.

The entrees were all okay. Nothing really stood out. The sad part is, everyone was obsessed with the broccoli and cheetos side dish that was complimentary to our meal.

1.0,2/14/2016,"Received glowing reviews about this restaurant but my experience was way different. It's a beautiful restaurant but the food is bad plain and simple. Appetizers were the only highlight of the meal, steak tartar was amazing as well as the scallop appetizer. But it went all down hill from there, the Gnocchi truffle special was small and not well done. The truffle shavings had a woody taste like old dried spices and had little actually truffle flavor. But the worst was the NY strip steak. Cut razor thin and cooked well done even though asked for medium rare. But the steak itself was also just a terrible quality of meat. The two sides we had were both awful too. Brussel sprouts in miso glaze should have been called vinegar soup with Brussel sprouts. Also the carrots in yogurt should not be legally sold at a restaurant because of how bad it was. Finally the toffee desert was so dry and uninspiring.  Cocktails were bad too. Nothing worse than these high end restaurants that have terrible, uninspired,  poorly executed menus. The place really needs to rethink a lot come spring.",1,0,0,Owen M.,"Westport, CT",0,9,1

Lots of white, bare branches and subtle lighting. The restaurant is spacious with a mixture of cozy booths and tables.  Good for groups. They have private rooms as well.  They offer a good selection of speciality cocktails (with a mixology flare) and wines.  I really enjoyed the winter menu.  Started with the butter squash soup, served over a ""lobster crouton"", crab cake and Brussels sprout salad.  All were great, but the crab cake topped them all - fresh crab meat that fell apart to the fork's touch (so not loaded with breadcrumb), served with avocado, orange, red onion and hearts of palm.  The rosemary and sea salt bread is served hot and melts in your mouth.  For dinner I ate the Dover sole special which was outstanding! Pan fried and served over a bed of spinach, cauliflower purée and homemade croutons. It was fresh and flaky, and I enjoyed it to the last bite. My boyfriend had the black sea bass, which was a really good portion, thick and tender.  As a side, the latkes were perfectly crisp and served with two dipping sauces.  Can't go wrong with the winter Sunday for dessert.

4.0,2/5/2016,"Food: I did Restaurant Week 2016 and tasted the Kabocha Squash Toast, Braised Short Rib, and family styled all the desserts including the Chocolate Cube! The toast had an amazing mix of flavors, but the squash was a bit harder to chew than I had expected. The short rib had a great texture, but was very salty and came with few vegetables to even out the flavor. Finally, I felt the Cube was overrated as the inside was just mousse and cake. In fact, the sticky toffee pudding was probably the best of the desserts and would recommend getting it. Even with my few gripes, the dishes were beautifully plated and were still delicious. Value: Considering usual prices, coming here for restaurant week was a great deal! They definitely didn't skimp on portion sizes either.Service: Great service! The food came at a pace that allowed us to eat and chat comfortably. We never wondered where our food was- great timing. Ambiance: This place is famous for changing its decoration with the seasons.

5.0,2/5/2016,"This is hands down, my favorite spot out of all the other restaurants I've ever tried for RW. I had a very pleasant experience from start to finish and service was nothing but fantastic! Reservations fill up so quickly for this place and I clearly understand why. The place is beautifully decorated to coincide with the seasons. The same concept goes for their menu.  So moving along to the food...I ordered the scallop sandwich since it seemed to be the app that a lot of fellow yelpers spoke highly of. My goodness, the scallops were cooked to perfection; they melt in your mouth (that's probably a little weird considering they're scallops but you have to try them to know what I mean). They included bacon bits and jalapeños which gave it a slight kick and the combination of these two blended beautifully to enhance the flavor of the entire dish. For my entree, I had a hard time choosing between the Mediterranean Branzino and the Pork chop schnitzel. They both sounded so good but I ended up going with the Pork chop. I probably should've went with the branzino only because I could only finish half the entree...the portion was HUGE. There was a light layer of salad on top with some kind of really good sauce and the dates added a nice touch. The only thing about this dish is that I wish it wasn't fried...I'm not the biggest fan of fried food but it was yummy nonetheless.When I looked at the dessert section, I was immediately drawn to the Toffee pudding. I knew I made the right choice when I realized everyone else in the restaurant also chose the same thing because that's what I saw the waiters bringing out over and over again. It comes with a scoop of bourbon pecan ice cream on top, then below this is the spongecake and on the very bottom, there are bananas that are bathed in toffee sauce! The coldness of the ice cream combined with the warmness of the spongecake offered a fine balance to the whole dessert. I was so impressed. Definitely one of the best menus I've seen. Jeez, even the bread they serve you before all the actual food was good. This place is a must try! I'll definitely be back for the next RW :)",3,0,2,Lena S.,"Flushing, Queens, NY",134,81,148

5.0,2/3/2016,"Summary:My girlfriend and I came here for ""Winter"" during restaurant week.  I'd have to say it's the best restaurant week spot I've been to.  Great tasting food and extremely generous portions.  A very warm and inviting atmosphere makes this a great place for a hot date.Food:Restaurant week menus are usually just small tastings of what the restaurant has to offer.  This menu was by no means small or ""tasting"" sized.  That being said, the huge portions packed quite a lot of taste.  We each got the RW menu.  For apps we had the crabcake dish and the scallop sandwich, both of which were fresh and tasty; used very high quality crabmeat and scallops.  For our mains we got the porkchop and the short ribs.  The porkchop was absolutely massive (in fact, I'm eating the leftovers while writing this).  The apple and dates accentuated the dish perfectly.  The short rib was off the bone and braised which just melted in your mouth; perfectly seasoned.  For dessert we got the toffee dish and the coconut ice cream with popcorn.  I'd say the toffee dish was as sweet as it sounds.  The coconut ice cream was right up my alley on the sweetness (not that sweet and just the right amount of creamy).Drinks:Ah... this is a shining achievement.  My girlfriend got the blood orange bellini which had the best blood orange infusion I've tasted.  Not too sweet, just right.  I got the triple dog dare.  Wow, if you like sweet with a kick, this drink packs a punch!  Tres bien!Service:Just right.  Our server was on point with everything.  All on time, at the right times.  Not overbearing and made some fantastic recommendations.Atmosphere:Very warm and inviting.Recommendation:Crabcake app!  Superb.Blood orange bellini and triple dog dare cocktails, you have to get 'em.",1,0,0,Paul H.,"Manhattan, NY",193,347,178
5.0,2/3/2016,Came here last night for restaurant week. Love the atmosphere and simple yet cozy decor. Everything was delicious from the pre-fixe menu. I had the peekytoe crabcake as my appetizer and my friend had the kabocha squash toast. We had the braised short ribs and the free range chicken for entrées.  My friend enjoyed the short ribs better but I feel that they were equally tasty. My friend's dessert was definitely better though. I should've known better when the waiter said 'excellent choice' to him when he ordered the sticky toffee pudding and I ordered the winter sundae. The takeaway... order the sticky toffee pudding (coming from someone who doesn't have that much of a sweet tooth... that dessert was amazing!!!),0,0,0,Nan. C.,"Manhattan, NY",51,18,28

The ladies next to me were complaining they were waiting for a glass of wine, forever.

4.0,2/2/2016,"I thoroughly enjoyed a solo dining experience here for restaurant week lunch and a rare weekday off.I wanted to sit in the main dining hall and gawk at the shiny lights above that reminisce of sparkling snow but I got sent to the bar. Lonely hearts club? I felt a bit like the overall atmosphere of the restaurant. Cold. Aloof. High ceilings to accentuate that you are alone in a park avenue building. Then the bartender became my lunch buddy and all was well.The choices are same as the regular menu options. I went with a open faced scallop sandwich. Those genetically enlarged (they were just big not sure about their true life before in my mouth) beauties were covered in jalapeño slices to my delight. Soo good!The branzino is worth the try. The spaghetti squash adds a confusingly light but hearty touch (brain thinks it's pasta, stupid brain). There is also sweet bits of golden raisins? I hate those but I ate them anyway and crunchy bits of some diced veggie I couldn't figure out. The branzino was skin on filleted and just the right amount of crisp.I was tempted to try the cube but I was told it's just a chocolate on chocolate on chocolate on more chocolate dessert. So I went with a sticky toffee pudding with caramelized banana. That hit the spot and filled the last bits of my stomach to the brim!The bar area is actually spacious if you are eating a quick bite. Next time I'll drag someone in with me so I can sit in the dining area. Pretty please Park avenue? You can get five stars if you agree.",3,4,3,Mary P.,"Brooklyn, NY",602,1551,2818
5.0,2/2/2016,"We decided to come here on the last week of 2016 Winter Restaurant Week because my gf happen-chanced upon a 6PM open reservation while playing around on OpenTable. We had heard a lot of good reviews and comments based on the quality of the food, presentation, and portions, so we knew we had to stop by. The restaurant has very, very dim lighting and we felt very awkward trying to take photos for our food blog. We ended up taking very quick shots of only two of the dishes, even though we wanted to document all courses.We opened with the Scallop Sandwich and the Crabcake. The scallop was fresh, light, and delicious. The bread and hash helped round out the flavors while the small sprouts freshened it up. I didn't like their take on the crab cake as it tasted and felt more like crab louie or crab sandwich spread. Their crabcake is not wholly fried and is instead sandwiched between two fried toasts. Still tasted good, but didn't warrant the extra $5 in my tastes.For our entrees we had the Halibut with Black Truffle ($10 extra) and the Braised Short Rib. I read a previous entry about the ribs and agree that the portions were HUGE and the meat was delicious. They were also right in that it's almost too much meat and not enough sides/vegetables to vary up the experience. As a meat lover, even I was overwhelmed. The halibut was fresh and light. I only had a few bites so I can't say much more on it.Desserts were the Winter Sundae and Sticky Toffee. Both were not bad, but not memorable. The popcorn in the ice cream is creative, but I don't think it executes well. The entrees completely overshadowed the desserts.Overall great meal and they didn't skimp on portions just because it was restaurant week. The price tag makes me reluctant to come on a normal day, but be sure to check them out again next Restaurant Week!",3,1,1,Justin Y.,"Washington, DC",801,355,90
3.0,2/1/2016,"Came here for RW lunch and felt it was just ok. We ate at 2:00pm so maybe that's why our experience wasn't good but nonetheless the restaurant felt like it was  stuck somewhere between fine dining and something more casual. Don't get me wrong the decor was beautiful, but the service was lacking, and the food did not wow us. The main dining area felt a lot more cramped than I expected, and much less spacious than the front half of the restaurant would suggest. Food-wise, the Scallop Sandwich was the best thing I had and I would probably come back for it. Jalapeños, buttery scallops, bacon fat soaked potato bits... yum. We tried the Branzino and Pork Chop Schnitzel for mains and the Branzino was tender but dry,  with an uneven salting to it. The Schnitzel was just ok as well, with a huge portion with a large salad on the side.Dessert was the second best course, with Toffee Pudding Cake that was everything you would expect from such a dish, but nothing more. Our dishes also took forever to come out, and service was spotty, with little mistakes like being given the dinner menu instead of lunch menu and dropping utensils.",2,0,0,Jordan J.,"Manhattan, NY",106,72,147

Came for RW winter 16- Scallop sandwich- superb, the best thing I ate all night. The jalapeños paired with the scallops were so good. The scallops were cooked perfectly. Branzino- a tad on the salty side... generous portion, and the Mediterranean vegetables on top were my favorite part, cut the dish nicely. Tangerine sorbet- it had candied orange peels which aren't really my jam... I think it just wasn't my taste.. From the other peoples dishes and tasting theirs, the toffee pudding cake thing was definitely the way to go. Judging by the opinions of everyone else at the table the short rib was the favorite of the night. ...

The short rib sandwich was one of the very best we've ever tasted. The pork chop Milanese was very good. The popcorn sundae and sticky pudding desserts were to die for!!

5.0,1/29/2016,"My husband and I came here for Restaurant Week and absolutely loved it! Out of all the restaurants that we have visited over Restaurant Week this is by far our favorite! We arrived a bit early, so had a drink at the bar. The bar area is really nice; cosy and romantic with dimmed lighting. I loved the decor of the restaurant in general, it was done really well, very sophisticated! When we were seated for dinner we were in a booth off to side, so we could see the entire restaurant. The seats were really comfortable. My husband ordered the winter scallop sandwich, pork chop schnitzel and sticky toffee carrot cake. He was really impressed and found each course to be outstanding. He particularly enjoyed his dessert, I tried some and it was so good! I had the pumpkin ravioli to start; considering it was ravioli I was impressed with the portion size, it was cooked perfectly and the filling and sauce were spot on. For my main course I had the braised short rib with vegetables. The portion was huge!! So much so that I struggled to finish it, I felt like I had been given two portions! The meat was tender, the sauce tasty. Due to the large piece of meat I would have liked a few more vegetables, but I can't complain as it was so good. For dessert I decided to pay the $5 supplement to try the Park Avenue chocolate cube. This was also way larger than I expected. It tasted great but I'm not sure I could appreciate it as I was so full, but it tasted great and I would definitely recommend it. As part of restaurant week they also had some drinks that were at great prices, such as the blood orange Bellini for $9. We had a fantastic experience and would love to return to try the food for all the different seasons! It is definitely worth the money. The service was great, consistent, not too intrusive, as other reviews indicate.

4.0,1/26/2016,"Beautiful restaurant where the decor changes along with the season. My friend had reservations for 5:30 (when dinner starts) during restaurant week. I arrived and they seated me while I waited. I was excited as I was led through the restaurant but that excitement quickly wore away when I realized I was being seated at a table up against a wall with no view of the main dining area in an empty room all the way in the back. I asked one of the many waiters standing around if I could be placed in the main room and was told that the main room only had tables for large groups and small groups of two (we had a reservation for 4). That seemed very strange, but at the very least I was told I could sit at a table that had a view into the dining area instead of being hidden away in the corner, since all of the tables were unoccupied.Beside that bizarre incident, the food was good. I had the soup, followed by the branzino and squash, followed by the sticky toffee pudding with ice cream and carmelized bananas. My dining companions enjoyed their meals but were not blown away. The waiters can be a bit over attentive, and they push all the meals that have a supplement on the rw menu when you ask for a recommendation.",4,1,1,Camille H.,"Brooklyn, NY",167,486,390
5.0,1/25/2016,"I was a fan of Park Avenue when they were still located on the Upper East Side, though this was my first time dining at the 'new' location. The menu didn't look too inspiring when they first reopened so I hadn't felt compelled to visit at first - though I often suggested the restaurant to many a work colleague as a good spot for business lunch - but I've been intrigued by their recent offerings, and, when taken for lunch there recently (Winter), was duly impressed! As the name suggests, the menu is reset according to season, as is the décor, which is (and has always been) elegant and lovely. Between us we had the following dishes, all of which were TOP NOTCH:- Park Avenue winter scallop sandwich (generous layer of buttery scallop slices atop a thin, garnished sliced of toast)- Cured lemon Caesar salad (perfectly and deliciously dressed)- Pork chop schnitzel with pear mustard, dates and cornichons (an elevated schnitzel, tenderly breaded and fried. I loved the arugula on top of it too.)- Mediterranean branzino with spaghetti squash 'carponata' - Sticky toffee pudding with caramelized bananas and bourbon pecan ice cream (the bananas were amazing, and I usually hate bananas!)- Winter White Sundae: popcorn ice cream, coconut & white mocha sauceAnd even though it was Restaurant Week, the dishes are what they normally offer on the standard lunch and dinner menus, so this turned out to be an incredible deal as well. Service was very good - attentive but not intrusive. Not only was my glass of water nice and icy, but it was kept constantly filled without having to ask! (This is a pet peeve of mine, even - especially! - in fine restaurants.) Park Avenue is just an outstanding experience all around: beautifully prepared and plated food made with high-quality seasonal ingredients, enchanting ambience, classy but unpretentious, and reasonably priced for a restaurant of this caliber. There is also a large bar area in the front of the restaurant, which is nice for dropping in for a drink as well.",0,0,0,Lailah J.,"New York, NY",1,13,1

His recommendations also happened to be everything with upcharges on the menu which made us think twice about asking him twice about any  other  dishes. on the other hand, the timing to when our dishes came out were on point and bread as well as amuse bouche timing were on point. Additionally, our water glasses were filled whenever it came close to empty, so those bits definitely revived our confidence in the potential of this .AMBIANCE/DECOR beautiful, romantic, and understated- the decor conveys the season without being overly lavish or decadent. It did get a bit loud as we approached 8pm.FOOD were beautifully plated but lacked consistency in flavor. Scallop sandwich was unimpressive and the 3 cheese was rubbery in the Mushroom Ribbon Lasagne when it got to the table. Also too salty and the cheese took over the dish.Other appetizers we got were: Kabocha toast (recommended!the cheese, honey and textures of the 3 complements each other and contrasts well with the crispiness of the toast) ----Butternut Squash soup (perfect coming from the cold)Mains: Branzino (recommended. a tad overcooked but most well balanced dish out of everything we ordered) ---Short Rib (hearty, rich, substantial)Dessert: Sticky Toffee Pudding (delicious and bananas complemented well (caramelized bananas would have taken this dish up a notch)---Cube (brownie bites + creme made for too dense of a filling but overall, great combination of different textures and flavors --ancho chili chocolate ice cream complemented the crispy cube shell and soft filling very well---OVERALLmediocre. service sub-par and food was hit or miss with no standouts. waiter service detracted from our experience but I will come back during other seasons and give the normal menus a second try.",4,0,0,Anna S.,"New York, NY",55,67,132

I really appreciate and am crazy about the fact that this place changes with the season, including their interior restaurant design, food and cocktail menu! Everything is always plated beautifully and the food is exceptional. I've been here for spring, summer and now winter restaurant week and I have yet to be disappointed. I have left full and satisfied every single time. It is definitely a great date place.It always starts with some fresh baked bread, topped with rosemary and salt, accompanied with some soft butter. Then the main attractions: For the winter restaurant week menu, my boyfriend and I shared the pumpkin ravioli and squash toast. The pasta of the ravioli was super al dente and the pumpkin was a perfect replacement of what could have been ricotta. It was covered in crushed hazelnuts that gave it a nutty crunch, accompanied by some tart cranberries. The squash toast had these amazing lettuce chips that added a great olive oil tasting crunch.For the entrees, we got the pork chop schintzel and braised short ribs. The pork chop and short ribs were cooked perfectly, so easy to cut with a knife. The pork chop was nice and crispy on the outside and was accompanied by a mild spicy pear mustard. The short Ribs (2 large pieces) were salty to the right level.As for the dessert, one was a hit and one was a miss. The miss was the popcorn ice cream. The pop corn added nothing to it and ice cream was bland. However the hit was so good, it completely compensated for the bad one. The sticky toffee sundae is excellent. The toffee cake was wonderful and sweet. It was atop some what seemed like grilled bananas. Mix everything with some caramel ice cream and you got yourself a dessert.

After we were seated, we were ignored for about 15 minutes (waiter no where to be seen). When an amuse bouche arrived, we were given no explanation of what it was. When the waiter finally took our order, we didn't see him again until almost the end of our entrees. When plates were taken away, my husbands plates would be cleared but mine weren't (even though they were empty). Service was just inconsistent and not up to par.. On to food.. Our appetizers were actually quite good. I would recommend the scallop toast.. The entrees on the other hand.. Were not impressive. I ordered the halibut with black truffle. The halibut was overcooked and the black truffle masked the flavor of the fish.. My husband ordered the short rib. Even though the short rib was tender.. It was quite dry... The table next two us found plastic in their food.. Twice.. (They cooked them a new entree and the second entree also had plastic in it) The desserts were actually pretty good as well.

They really encompass diners in a theme of whatever season it may be. I've seen a lot of reviews about bad service, but our waiter was the man! We chatted about anything and everything, really attentive. The food was less memorable, but in hindsight I kind of just think we ordered the wrong things. They started us off with an amuse of watermelon cubes on sticks with a dollop of goat cheese, this was cute and refreshing. Also, the corn bread to start was delicious. We tried a fried soft shell crab appetizer with a strawberry slaw salad which was pretty good. For my main I got the Dr. Pepper Baby Back Ribs, which is very out of character for me to order. I don't remember them being unbelievable or anything, also super messy obviously! My boyfriend got some kind of burgers, and they were just okay too.

When we sat down, we noted we wanted to be out of there in an hour and a half and somehow they definitely did it! The prix fixe brunch menu was delicious. We started off with some warm cinnamon monkey bread that had come with rum raisin, cream cheese frosting, and candied pecans. It was DIY style so you could put together the toppings yourself (I thought it was going to added in already). We also ordered bellinis - I ordered the blood orange one which was super delicious, but my best friend decided to order the truffle pearl because it was the most unique but that was too much truffle for me. I started off with the breakfast risotto which included mushrooms, sausage and bacon, topped off with a runny egg! I really enjoyed it actually, then again, I do love risotto so it's not a surprise. I did wish there was more to it, but then again, I dont because I was certainly full after my meal here. I also ordered the smoked salmon eggs benedict.  I'm not a big smoked salmon person, but I did enjoy this. It was good, but not amazing. There wasn't enough muffin to my eggs and salmon! I do like a pretty even ratio, and there was not enough. The location is amazing and apparently it changes every season which is pretty cool. I wish there was a restaurant like that in SF.

We made reservations since we expected a holiday rush, but I guess not.We gave ourselves 90min, which our server told us would be no problem. The first course was the warm cinnamon monkey rolls that came right out. There were 4 rolls per pan, which for 2 people is a LOT. There were fixings on the side, like candied walnuts, pecans, extra icing, etc that made my first roll different from my second. Yum!I decided on the Yogurt for my app, which was way bigger than I thought it was going to be. And it was delicious! A very well thought out, well rounded dish. I honestly could've stopped the meal right there - my tummy was so happy after that. I got the Prime NY Strip Paillard for my main, and it was good. Not entirely memorable, tbh, but I enjoyed it in the moment.I'd say the biggest let down of my meal was actually the bellini. I got the truffle pearl. I'm glad I tried it since this would be the restaurant to try out different flavor combinations, but warm truffle pearls just don't go with chilled champagne.

After the bread basket was empty we had salad, main dish, and two sides. We each had a different desert. The Chocolate Cube was a must for me! Those were the days.

4.0,12/28/2015,"This restaurant is fantastic for its atmosphere and seasonal menu. I've been here a number of times on several different occasions and the service is always very good and the atmosphere lovely.Last time I came here was for brunch about a week ago. They have a great brunch menu: at $32, you get shared pastries for the table, one appetizer and one entree. For what you're getting in terms of atmosphere, that is quite the steal. For the pastries, my friend and I had the cinnamon monkey rolls, which came with raisins, walnuts and frosting. The pastry was warm and fluffy and came with adorable presentation. It was nice being able to customize the toppings that you wanted. For my appetizer, I went with the breakfast risotto. It came with an egg on the top which was a nice surprise and made it a more brunch oriented dish. The texture was rich, and the risotto wasn't too salty. The dish had just the right amount of sausage and bacon to ensure that it wasn't too heavy and you still had room for a second plate. For my entree, I had the cinnamon-apple french toast. What stood out the most was the really large portion. I didn't like it as much as the risotto - somehow it seemed that the focus was quantity over quality. The french toast was drenched in syrup and was not dynamic in flavor. The taste of tart apples overrode most everything else. Lastly, avoid the orange juice. Definitely wasn't fresh squeezed.Looking back at the other meals that I've had here, some dishes taste great and others are a little disappointing or just 3 stars. It really depends on how you order. The reason I keep coming back, and why I gave 4 stars, is for the great service and the awesome decor; guests are always impressed by the choice since it definitely stands out! The restaurant is almost always bustling and the decorations are ornate, yet tasteful.Favorites: Breakfast risottoAtmosphere: Perfect for a date, hanging out with friends, or big groupsThis is one of the few restaurants I've found in NYC that impresses all my friends, but still has room for reservations a week ahead, even if it's for very large groups!

4.0,12/27/2015,"despite the mixed review, the food here was pretty good overall. the pumpkin ravioli was solid - the berries didn't really add much for me besides acidity to cut through the whole winter taste in my mouth (which i actually just appreciate on its own), but overall was good. in n out burgers were good as well with extremely thin, crisp house chips. Pork schnitzel was HUGE and crispy and piping hot - worth the money in my books. Apple mustard sauce on side was great as well. highlight might just go to the complimentary parker rolls...these are so damn good to the point i might just search for restaurants that serve these and go to those places from now on.",0,0,0,Sung K.,"New York, NY",251,569,0

The portions for each dish individually were not that large, but the Prix Fixe comes with a pastry, appetizer and a main which was enough.The Monkey Rolls are absolutely delicious, they have this pastry in each season's brunch menu with a different glaze/topping.

5.0,12/8/2015,"Have tried every season except Spring, and this place never ceases to impress. It's definitely an upscale/classier establishment, but the experience is far more rooted in the ambiance and seasonally focused cuisine than it is the aspect of fine dining - which is great, because it won't feel stuffy. The food is always the right selection for the season (obviously) and for the most part well-executed on. As with I think a lot of restaurants of this nature where there is something for everyone, you should choose wisely when it comes to your entree, and ask your server for guidance. Every time I have been here our party samples a great array of appetizers, and they are all usually a hit (including the bread - always an amazing seasonal surprise). However, when it comes to entrees, I would gear your order to be more individualized. I tasted a few friends' dishes and found myself thinking ""mm, that's pretty good, but definitely glad I ordered what I did"". so be mindful. The service is great, and the staff really know the menu, so pick their brain and arrive at the choice of entree that is right for you.As an added bonus, I never mind waiting for a table, even if our reservation is running late. The bar and lounge/parlor area are very cozy and a good place to sip on a drink while you wait.

The drinks were very well crafted.Overall, the food was very tasty, but the portions were fairly small. The chicken in their free-range chicken dish was also pretty dry.

The plating was a little sloppy, the execution was a little off, etc.In addition, we were also rushed. Not sure why though, since it wasn't at all busy at that time.

2.0,11/24/2015,"I came here for a group dinner, and had been wanting to try this place for a while. First of all, the dishes are beautifully plated, but the taste just didn't match the presentation. They had some interesting sounding combinations (Broccoli and Cheetos), but the flavors just didn't work. I did like the pumpkin bread they had out, as well as the crispy apple pre-appetizer on sticks (not on the menu). Here is a quick rundown of the items I tried.1. Peekytoe crabcake: This was just OK. Although there was a crisp on both sides that were pan-fried, the center just fell apart without any true texture. The best part was the salad on the side.2. Steak tartare Rossini: The bread was good, but the tartare was much too salty to be enjoyable. 3. Park Avenue Autumn haystack: This was good and refreshing, but no unique flavors in this dish.4. Mushroom ribbon lasagna: Again, very salty and too much cheese. You can barely taste the pasta because it was so heavy.5. Long Island duck: This was OK. The duck could have been slightly more tender and flavored. It was a bit bland and the pieces are small for the price.6. King salmon: Very mediocre salmon that was overcooked. 7. Halibut and black truffles: Also overcooked. Even truffles couldn't salvage this dish. We had a lot of this dish left over.8. Potato latkes: Again, the tastes were bland. Basically fried potato without anything unique.9. Roasted mushrooms: Lightly roasted...I believe these are Hen of the Woods mushrooms? I did like this because it was lightly salted so the flavors did come through.10. Miso-glazed brussel sprouts: The sprouts themselves were good, but it lacked the crunch and slightly burnt texture that makes brussel sprouts so good. In addition, they overpowered it with the miso glaze. 11. Broccoli and Cheetos: This dish did not work...very heavy dish. The Cheetos I could barely taste through the cheese. It's a shame, because it sounded interesting. 12. Park Ave Chocolate Cube: The chocolate itself was good, but the filling inside the cube was a bit too spicy I felt. Reminds me of Mexican hot chocolate. Comes with a scoop of dark chocolate ice cream.13. Sticky toffee pudding: There is a bit of a brownie cake with a scoop of ice cream on top. Couldn't really tell the various components within.14. Apple crostata: Probably my favorite dessert, but still didn't blow me away.15. Autumn sundae: Nothing special about this either. Just your typical sundae.Overall, I was disappointed because no dish stood out, and no dish impressed me.

The ambiance was classy, but comfortable and cozy. We certainly felt the warmth of autumn inside the restaurant. Our friendly upbeat server Bradford greeted us with a complimentary amuse, which was an absolutely delicious applish bite. We nearly overlooked the pumpkin bread presented as we scanned the menu and eyed all of the tasty options! So glad we didn't, it was awesome! While enjoying several appetizers we looked over the wine list. A little torn, we requested the expertise of the wine steward, Justin, who helped us finalize our 105$ Pinot Noir selection. Each dish was we ordered was expertly prepared, and beautifully presented. We dined on four appetizers and one salad precourse: the spiced olives, the crispy pork confit, the shrimp haystack, the grilled quail, and the frommage blanc. The last two being our absolute favorites, but don't skip the fresh salad bed under the panko shrimp. Then for our main dishes we enjoyed the Halibut with the black truffle accent and the Pork Schnitzel, yum! The sides we had were the Cheetos& broccoli, sautéed spinach, and the corned brûlée.

Despite spending several hundred dollars on our meal, our server did not thank us or say a word when returning the bill. Furthermore, I asked for some very basic information about the wine list, and our waiter had no knowledge of any of them and had to ask the manager for his opinion (which, I admit, was helpful in choosing a bottle for the table).

3.0,10/15/2015,"The Stillmans re-opened up their seasonal Park Avenue restaurant last year with chefs Benkei O'Sullivan and Zene Flinn. The name of the restaurant changes with the seasons to reflect the seasonal menu. The concept is neat and the ambiance is on point with the seasons. That being said, I was disappointed with the food and the service. The cool ambiance is probably the only reason this place has so many positive reviews considering the food is rather average.I went to Park Avenue Autumn for brunch last weekend and I found the place to not be worth the price tag. You can easily spend $50-60 per person (without drinks) for brunch since there is a 3 course pre-fixe menu. I wouldn't mind paying so much for a fancy brunch if the food and service were actually excellent. It is all about the value. I started with roasted butternut soup with sour apple crème and spiced pepitas (a fancy word for pumpkins seeds). Sounds delicious, doesn't it folks? The soup was somewhat tasty but extremely salty. It is a pet peeve of mine when chefs use too much salt because it implies they are trying to mask the lack of flavor in the dish. I find it difficult to justify paying for something that I can make at home a million times better. If they had kept it simple and just roasted and blended the squash, an apple and an onion, it would have been spectacular. For my main course I tried the avocado eggs benedict with jalapeno hollandaise. To my surprise, this dish contained raw onions and cilantro, both of which I strongly dislike. Indeed, I have that gene that makes cilantro taste like the worst thing on the planet so I was not a happy camper. I would have really appreciated it if the menu had clearly stated which ingredients would be included in the dish. However the description simply said ""avocado eggs benedict"" I am a huge eggs benedicter and this is the first time I have ever had onions and cilantro sneaked into the dish, ergo can you fault me for forgetting to ask if the dish contained cilantro? On a separate note, raw onions don't even go with eggs benedict. I also tried the ricotta pancakes with mixed berries and orange crème fraiche. I don't want this entire review to be negative so let's just say the best thing about this dish were the berries on top Finally, I must comment on the service. The restaurant did not even bring out our first course, the pastry, which was a cinnamon monkey roll. The friendly couple next to us had to inform us that we were missing out on a delicious treat. When we informed our server she goes ""You didn't get it? I mean, do you even want it now?"" UM YES PLEASE. She didn't even apologize or seem slightly apologetic. Overall, the service was inattentive and disingenuous. Our water glasses were empty 75% of the time but our server was never anywhere to be found so we ended up having to ask another server for water after we paid our check.

2.0,10/11/2015,"We were huge fans of the ues location but were extremely disappointed during our visit to the new location on 26 street. The vibe isn't quite the same, but most importantly the service is terrible. We had a 730 reservation on a Sunday evening. It took 20 minutes to seat us and did not appear too busy. By 2 hours into putting our order in we still hadn't received our main course. We asked for the check after eating the meal we finally received, and it took another 15 minutes to bring that because they wanted to make it up to us by bringing 5 desserts. We appreciate the gesture but we wanted to leave. Food wise- it's good, but doesn't off set our experience.",0,0,0,David M.,"Yorkville, Manhattan, NY",17,4,3
3.0,10/11/2015,"Decor and atmosphere get 5 stars, but a restaurant is much more than its decorations, is it not? We came for the Autumn rotation. Great details like pumpkin rolls and maple/apple butter. Entrees were a little disappointing with undercooked steak and a very odd dish called Cheetos and broccoli. I'm all for a play on the munchies, but I could have created this in my microwave with ingredients purchased at a gas station convenience store. All of this would still merit 4 stars, but the service was atrocious.

2.0,10/10/2015,"I went here last night (10/9/2015) for a friend's birthday with six other people. She'd been talking this place up for a few weeks, despite never having been there, and based on the Yelp reviews, I was fairly excited as well. Ambiance/First Impression: When we first walked in, I definitely admired the ambiance - but I wasn't blown away. It's romantic and pretty in Park Avenue Autumn, but nothing is overwhelmingly autumnal about it. Definitely not bad and definitely still classy, just not as great as I was expecting from a place that sells itself on being a seasonal experience. Also, the plaid shirts on the waiters seemed like an odd choice at an upscale restaurant to me. ****Drinks: We were disappointed to find that one of the primary reasons we went, the ""Autumn Daiquiri"", which is described on their online menu as ""Rum, Cinnamon, Fresh Lime & Candycorn Ice served in a Pumpkin,"" apparently does not come in a pumpkin anymore? FALSE ADVERTISING! Additionally, considering the fact that the menu is supposed to be curated for autumn, the drinks all seemed to have more of a summery feel (a lot of citrus fruits and summer berries, not a lot of spices). Maybe we just didn't order the right stuff. However, the drinks we did get were quite tasty - just not really helping in terms of building an autumnal experience. ***Food: The appetizers, which were on the house, were great! We got adorable little breadcrumb apple bites on sticks and pumpkin bread with maple butter, which was absolutely delicious. For my main, I got the mushroom lasagna (one of the few vegetarian options, which was disappointing). It was quite good, but not the greatest thing I've ever had. I didn't feel like the flavors were very interesting and - again - it did not taste very autumnal. I also tried my friend's roasted butternut squash soup and wasn't blown away. Nothing was bad, but I'll get to why I was underwhelmed in general at the end. ****Service: The huge snafu in my experience, which really colored my vision of the restaurant, was the fact that another woman at my table ordered the same thing as me (the mushroom lasagna). Mine was all melty with a cream sauce filling the bowl, while hers looked a bit like a tiramisu - very firm and upright. When she bit into it, she immediately realized IT HAD NOT BEEN COOKED. Clearly it looked wrong and had not been prepared, something the waitstaff probably should have picked up on when serving the plates. It's also always a little distressing when you get reminded that most of the food from restaurants comes out of the freezer, even at nicer places. The waiter took it back but didn't seem particularly concerned or apologetic. As a former waitress, I felt a little surprised - a gaffe like that deserves an apology! [Otherwise, the servers were all very attentive and patient with our strange dietary concerns and the amount of time we needed with the menu. Our food came out quickly and they were all very nice.] ***Overall: Listen. This is a really nice place with a really cool idea, but I feel as though this dichotomy that Midtown has set up of forcing you to pay for quality or ambiance is ridiculous. It seems somewhat clear to me that this restaurant is relying on the gimmick to get people in the door, but in a city with so much good food, your ambiance and experience had better be very to get me to pay those kinds of prices, considering how much great food is available at lower costs in NYC. This wasn't necessarily a horrible dining experience, and had the prices been in more of the ""$$"" than the ""$$$"", I would have been more forgiving, but I want to encourage them to up their game - cold food without an apology, false advertising, and a somewhat oddly curated drinks menu, are not counterbalanced by slightly above average food and above average ambiance. A three-star experience at five-star prices is just not worth it! Go to Brooklyn or downtown and pay half the price for better food and places that are just as nice/cool as this one.",0,0,1,Es R.,"Brooklyn, NY",1,5,0
2.0,10/7/2015,Went with a large group last night and was extremely underwhelmed.  The Buccatini and Clams were terrible with very fishy clams and dry pasta.  The Gnocchi dish was lukewarm and the gnocchi actually broke apart like dry bread when I tried to put my fork in it.  The Burger is only available in medium rare or well done.  I chose medium rare and the burger came out medium well and dry.  The Halibut was bland and just ok. The Fig dessert was pretty bad.  Tasted like they went down to china town and bought some figs off the street cart and sliced them up and left the hard skin on.  The redeeming factors were the nice atmosphere and pumpkin bread.  Hopefully this place is not starting to go downhill....it was pretty bad.,0,1,0,Zachary A.,"New York, NY",9,58,3

4.0,9/23/2015,"Hadn't been here in a few years, back when it was the Hurricane Club. I actually thought the Hurricane Club had great food and great ambiance, but also still glad that Park Ave is here to stay as well. We were here for the Autumn menu, which they started serving at the beginning of September, and not at the actual autumnal equinox. Not that I minded at all, ha.They came out with some pumpkin bread and pear amuse bouche, which was brought out on a log. Yeah, like a log from a tree. Interesting. In all, the amuse bouche was good, and the pumpkin bread came out fresh and warm, and didn't even need any butter. Interesting to start off the meal with sweet flavors, but I'm not complaining.We decided to split an entrée and a few of the small plates they had, going with the soft-shell crab, the Park Ave haystack with fried shrimp, the mushroom strudels, and the Long Island duck breast. The soft-shell crab was perfectly crispy, as was the shrimp in the haystack, and the mushroom strudels (more like spring rolls), had a very creamy texture and earthy flavor, pairing well with the  sriracha. The duck had some really great flavor, with and without the port wine sauce, and the figs/vegetables it came with were pretty bomb. That being said, I did think it was a bit pricey at $36, given the small 3-piece portion. I realize duck breasts aren't that large (heh), but the price just seemed a bit excessive. Such is life in New York, I guess. I really shouldn't be that surprised.Service was very friendly and attentive, but something glaring was that our waiter didn't seem to know a lick about the menu, both for food and drinks. We asked him how certain things tasted or what might be paired well together, and he made some very fumbling and unintelligible recommendations. We asked him what marcona was, as it was featured prominently in one of the dishes. He didn't know at all. Just an FYI, it's a type of Spanish almond that has a sweeter, more delicate flavor than your typical almond. Nonetheless, I think we just trusted our gut and made the right choices. As mentioned before, prices were a little high, but everything we had was good, so I can't quite complain.I'll be back to try their other seasonal menus. Guess I'll just have to wait 3 months to do so.",19,13,17,Eric J.,"New York, NY",490,923,1792

1.0,9/12/2015,"Restaurant decor was very pretty. Our table for two was available at reservation time. Tables for two were a bit close to one another. We ordered a carafe of wine, which was good, but the waitress insisted on emptying it into our glasses, which filled the glasses way beyond where they should have been filled. And it was awkward as the waitress tried to evenly distribute the wine. She clearly should have waited until glasses were less full. I ordered the Halibut which was not only flavorless but over cooked!!  I informed the waitress and she did offer to give me something else but I refused the offer. My sister ordered the scallops which were cooked well but nothing spectacular. We shared the Brussels sprouts side dish which was so sweet it tasted like something from a Birds Eye frozen product. How to ruin a beautiful produce?!?!They gave us extra wine and a dessert as an apology, although it seemed like everyone got an extra dessert!Desserts were nothing to write home about. All in all, after walking past this restaurant for months, I don't need to ever return! Next season or any season.  With so many great restaurants in NYC it is not acceptable to be mediocre.

4.0,9/4/2015,"Came here for summer 2015 restaurant week dinner. The restaurant décor is nice and looked pretty tropical. They are known for changing their décor according to the seasons. Just like the name of this restaurant. Not a big fan of restaurant week, but Park Avenue is one of the few restaurants that offer a pretty good menu and not a crappy one that's not worth your money. They had a decent selection to choose from and not just one or two items on the menu. You get an amuse bouche, which was watermelon with some sort of spicy creamy sauce on top. I think the watermelon taste better on it's own. But it was complimentary, not complaining. You also get complimentary corn bread in a pretty shell shape, which was very good. For appetizer we had the crispy soft shell crab ($5 supplement boo..., but was worth it. The crab was very meaty and nicely seasoned) and cured lemon caesar salad. Ordered a salad because I needed some greens in my systems, otherwise I just wouldn't order salad. And the salad was huge. It definitely made me full. The salad was okay. Not digging the cured lemon thing, but it wasn't bad.For entrees we had the dr. pepper baby back ribs and branzino. Both were great and the taste was just right. Not overly saucy or anything. Desserts we had the carrot cake and mint sundae. Love the carrot cake with ice cream. And the mint sundae was refreshing with a bit of brownie.Overall, I had a great time. We had a lovely server.

The server was not very nice about this and completely was catching an attitude with us. She made us feel uncomfortable and unwelcome. It's not like I enjoy sending food back. I had to send back those two dishes because they were completely INEDIBLE!! If I was trying to just get free food, I would have sent back one of the more expensive items.The manager was nice enough to bring out some asparagus to make up for the snap peas, but we were already so full and weren't able to eat most of the dish. Although we were appreciative of the gesture and thanked him.When we were on our way out, the manager came to our table to greet us goodbye. I thanked him and left. Apparently, he did not like the response he received from the rest of my party (I think they just smiled and acknowledged him), he had the audacity to just stand there awkwardly and blurt out ""What?!, I can't even get a thank you?"". I actually didn't hear him say that since I was the first to leave. My friend told me this after we already got outside.

5.0,8/24/2015,"Actually have been to Park Avenue for every season back when it was at its older location uptown. This was my first time at the current location, where I went for Summer.I've always loved how well they are able to execute each season change, and the attention to detail that goes to essentially doing a restaurant makeover every few months. From the decor, signage, colors on the tables, uniforms, everything matches with the season. This place also holds its own during Restaurant Week, something more restaurants should take note. The prix fixe features a wide selection of favorites from the regular menu, and supplements (if any) are kept to minimum. Services remains professional and intact.For our lunch, we were served a complimentary bread plate of cornbread baked in the shape of seashells and whipped butter. Even the bread changes with the seasons! It was a charming presentation and delicious. I chose the corn gnocchi, the crab and avocado roll, and the cherry & corn sundae. Everything was so perfectly done! The corn gnocchi practically melted in my mouth, the corn was so sweet and crisp. The crab and avocado roll was so light and tasty, and the two went well together. I loved the whimsical corn pops and corn cake on the sweet and vibrant cherry ice cream.  Really can't go wrong with any of the seasons, but you might as well dine at each one just for the fun of comparing them all.",3,2,2,Steph C.,"Brooklyn, NY",478,767,323

Now the we just restaurant week to look forward to, but the food may be even better. This is not my first time around the park nor will it be my last. I've still got park autumn and park spring to check out. Restaurant week is for are hot or miss. Some of he best restaurants in my often are the biggest disappointment when it comes to restaurant week. With the Park you will not be disappointed.  Good service, great decor, great venue, blah blah blah, on this occasion I was more concerned about the food...Here's what I learned:Amouse bouche?: - cornbread shaped like seashell: cornbread on the high end scale, very moist and with a side of chipotle butter. An added twist was the real kernels of sweet corn baked in every little bit. mmmmm. - watermelon cube on a stick with harissa sauce: light and refreshing. some guest at the table thought this was for decoration at first and didn't think to eat them. how silly.Starters:the BEST part of the meal- corn gnocci: this is one of the best fancy things I've put in my mouth in awhile. The gnocci is itself crispy on the outside, and surround in a foamy, soap like texture but with a savory ""best potato chip"" flavor. Then comes the sauce, which gives you that decadent truffle flavor. - soft shelled crab: I tried a bite of my friend's app. these did not disappoint. the soft shell crab meat to batter ratio was perfect...more meat but did not lose the rich batter flavor and crunch. Mains:- Dr. Pepper baby back ribs: I was a bit disappointed by my main course selection (notice I'm not blaming the restaurant, but my self for poor choice selection). Though the meat was perfectly textured, fall of the bone, it was nonetheless too sweet. I wasn't too big of a fan of the salad either, which again was sweet which just added to the overall sugar overload. Portion SIZE was great though, it you're hungry. Several meaty ribs and plenty of salad. - Other options: had a chance to try SCALLOPS and the STEAK (extra on top of RW dinner price). both of these seemed like better main course optionsDessert:- Chocolate cube: essence of decadence...it's there classic dish, nearly impossible to finish- chocolate cake, lavender fudge, ice cream: wasn't blown away, but very a nice filling finish to an overall great meal.

This is a later entry, ate there beginning of August.When you walk in, the interior design is really stunning.  I would say it reminded me of luxury and a careful attention to detail and design.  It is one of the nicer interiors I've been to in a restaurant.  Started off with the Monkey rolls. At first, I wasn't sure if it was bread or what, but once the scent hits you and you start connecting the dots that they are cinnamon rolls, you are intrigued.  They stuff about 6 rolls into a smaller base, and they kind of overtake the size of the dish.  They were very tasty.Appetizer: I initially got the Smoked Salmon & Bucatini, my girlfriend got the Corn Gnocchi.  I wasn't a fan of the Smoked Salmon & Bucatini, but I don't necessarily like the smoked flavor with the combination that was present. Luckily my girlfriend liked mine better and I tasted her Corn Gnocchi and we switched.  I liked the Corn Gnocchi better because of the texture of the corn, it was really crisp, I can't recall the overall taste of the dish, but the texture of the corn was to my liking.  Entree: I got the Bacon, Egg & Cheeseburger, it came with Bodega sauce and a hash brown.  The cheeseburger is a mix between a slider size and a regular hamburger.  It was a bit on the smaller side.  The egg started leaking.  I ended up eating the burger with my fork because it got messy. The patty itself was very good.  The bacon was not memorable. The overall cohesiveness of the burger was not there.  The hash brown was too oily and not crispy enough, I couldn't finish it.  The Bodega sauce was good.  Overall Impression:I would like to come back every season and see how the decor inside changes.  I was definitely a fan of the design.  The food, in my opinion, was a little below par. The monkey rolls were fun, the corn gnocchi was memorable, but then the entree was not as good as I had hoped for. I never want to degrade someone's food creation, but I don't think the cheeseburger was a good one. I wouldn't get it again.  I will definitely go there again in another season, mainly to see the decor and then to also try to see if the entree will redeem itself.",0,0,0,Peter J.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",34,243,119

Tables to the side were seated somewhat tightly next to one another but did see circular booths that offer more space from your dining neighbors. Warm, friendly waitress. But we're here to discuss food.My friend and I ordered off of the summer Restaurant Week menu. Here's what we had:Strawberry gazpachoCorn gnocchiDr. Pepper baby back ribsViking village scallopsMint chocolate sundaeSticky toffee coffee cakeMy friend said that everything she ordered was delicious. As for me, the corn gnocchi was really good. It did not have that sometimes too gummy gnocchi-like texture that makes you feel like you've been chewing on it for days. The ribs were a revelation, and they did not skimp on the sauce or the portion, that's for sure. I thought the mint chocolate sundae was just perfect and didn't find it overly sweet like other Yelpers wrote.Also, the rhubarb bellini was refreshing and an excellent accompaniment to my meal.In short, an enchanting space + delicious food + service with a smile + not your typical Restaurant Week menu = 5 stars. And, oh, the bathroom smells great too. They must have an aromatherapist on staff lol.",0,0,0,Linda H.,"Manhattan, NY",0,53,105
5.0,8/13/2015,"Had a fantastic experience here! We came here for brunch to celebrate a special event and loved our brunch experience. The staff was fantastic! Sat us even though some of the people in our party were late and gave us great advice throughout the brunch (we stayed for a good 3 hours!). The brunch starts off with some monkey rolls. The raspberry preserves and the lemon thyme cream they come with are delicious. The appetizers were the BEST part! We all got different things and everything tasted incredible. I would recommend the corn gnocchi, each bite was a delight. I remember thinking wow I did not have something so tasty in a long time. The risotto was probably my second favorite.The mains were good (although not as exceptional as the appetizers). I got the crab and avocado roll and I loved the raspberry touch (raspberries on the roll + raspberry hot sauce on the side). It gave the roll a unique taste. We got sangria for the table and different cocktails (I loved the passion fruit-lime Bellini). We also tried their home made ""summer cantaloupe cordial"" and it's really good. For desserts, we shared the Park avenue chocolate cube and the mint chocolate sunday. We also asked them if we could have a scoop of the cream cheese sherbert on the side and they gladly accommodated. They make the mint chocolate ice cream and sherbert themselves (with real mint) and you can taste it. It was really good. I personally was not a huge fan of the cube, but my friends loved it. I will say that it was worth ordering just for the way it looks though (have a look at the pictures of the cube others have posted). Overall, I'm a fan.

2.0,8/13/2015,We had eaten in Park Ave...several times before its move downtown.  The food was no longer special or interesting at all. The service was lacking. We waited 10 min just to get a taste of a wine & my food arrived before the taste. My husband was never asked if he wanted a drink with his main. One of the desserts brought was wrong so it was brought back to the kitchen.  By the time it reappeared my husband had finished his. We were never asked if we wanted coffee or an after dinner drink.

The restaurant menu also looked amazing - so many sweet corn items!!! When we got there, we were seated immediately in this gorgeous dining room that's been set up for their summer season. Other than the food being great, the presentation of everything was also impeccable.Even before we ordered anything, a waiter gave us some complimentary amuse bouche - first item was a corn bread with chipotle butter shaped like seashells...these were to die for. We also got some watermelon cubes on skewers that had a spicy and minty mayonnaise on top, really refreshing!Corn Gnocchi | Summer Truffles ParmesanYummyyyyyy the sweet corn really shines in this dish. The gnocchi were kind of different than what I thought it was supposed to be - this was more like deep fried pieces of potato, but still good. Kind of reminded me of tater tots. The waiter also shaved a LOT of truffle on top of our dish :D.Viking Village Scallops | Creamed Corn, Pickled PeppersYup, more corn!!! If you want a lot of food, this is not your dish since it really only has 3 pieces of scallop. But the flavors and textures of the creamed corn and pickled peppers really complimented the scallop. The scallops were seared really magnificently, so this is definitely a dish to get!Sticky Toffee Carrot CakeThis seemed like something I probably wouldn't' have been able to make at home (like I wouldn't have gotten the sundae), so I ordered it although I'm not a huge fan of carrot cake. This was actually really good! I couldn't really finish a lot of it though since it became a little overly sweet with the sticky toffee.A good restaurant to visit once a season :) Or at least during the restaurant weeks!!!",1,0,1,Patricia C.,"Manhattan, NY",135,275,1463

5.0,8/12/2015,"You delicious devil you... What have you done to me?! What kinda crack cornbread are you spinning back there? And do you sell em by the dozen??Firstly, I have to comment how gorgeous the establishment is. Beautifully adorned and romantically lit, Park Ave can win the hearts of many. But can it win the stomachs? It can. It did. For starters, we had burrata with peaches and the corn gnocchi with truffle parmesan. I wished the burrata was creamier but the combo itself was delicious enough to forgive the cheese. The gnocchi is more of a tater tot texture; they're not your usual pillowy soft dough drops. Quite possibly due to the summer staple, corn! Truffle is clearly present and the sauce delivers the tastes you seek. They're different, they're delicious, and they're gone. It was tough to maintain our composure when the entrees arrived. The scallops were pan-fried to perfection and they sat delicately in a pool of creamed corn. We wanted to attack the plump sea treasures but we cannot be savages in the presence of such elegance. Gingerly, we ate. But the ribs... How can we devour the juicy ribs and keep our lady images intact? Here's a tip: ladies...you are one fine individual no matter what so do what you gotta do and tear that b*tch up!*Lastly, the desserts. Who can resist that mysterious chocolate cube? Not a chocolate lover. Not this chocolate addict. But boy, the amount they used is no joke. Be prepared to be slammed by chocolate because I assure you, it's not for the fainthearted. It was so rich and intense that even the deepest dessert lover (my bff) had to maneuver her spoon away and towards to the toffee carrot cake, which holds its own for being a decadent dish as well.

2.0,8/11/2015,"Having just come back from my 2nd client/business lunch here, I would not recommend this restaurant.  It was really much better at it's uptown Park Avenue original venue.The service was improved, as it was subpar the first time here, but the food overall is just mediocre.  Best thing is the room layout as it's large and there's room to breath between the tables.  But in the end, the food is rather mediocre and there are lots of better options out there.",0,0,0,Alan A.,"East Chatham, NY",0,13,0
3.0,8/7/2015,"Great service and ambience, but the food was just okay. I was very impressed that they precut the baby back ribs, which were delicious and oh so tender. In general, the menu was very inventive, but many of the flavor combinations were better on paper than in execution. For example, the cherry and corn sundae dessert had no need for the corn (corn pop?) accent, and the burrata with peaches and tomatillo sauce was good if you combined the cheese with either the sweet or the spicy part of the dish, but not both. I was a little disappointed that all of the beautiful photos online were of the previous location.  This new one is very pretty, but not as dramatic as the uptown location.",0,0,0,Lauren G.,"Bronx, NY",152,60,15
5.0,8/7/2015,"We came here for lunch during Restaurant Week mostly because we were interested in the dessert options, but the rest of meal was surprisingly delicious!Summary: Worth the price for Restaurant Week and what didn't seem like super exciting options turned out to be really really good. Recommended:Burrata/Corn GnocchiScottish Salmon/Dr. Pepper Baby Back RibsCherry & Corn SundaeAppetizer:We had the Burrata and Corn Gnocchi. The burrata was amazing! Really rich and creamy, the center oozes out when you cut into it. The other elements of the dish, mainly the peaches, all work very well together. The foam in the gnocchi dish was surprisingly flavorful. I also liked the texture and flavor of the gnocci. Main Course:We had the Dr. Pepper Baby Back Ribs and Scottish Salmon. Everything was cooked beautifully. The meat slid right off the bone for the ribs. Jam-packed with flavor. I dislike Dr. Pepper but as it was incorporated into the sauce it worked really well. The side of refreshing cucumber salad with peaches was a good compliment. The salmon was super flaky and melts in your mouth. The citrus-y salad on top and creamy avocado spread made it a great combo. Dessert:We came for the Chocolate Cube and in the end it was a bit disappointing. It was definitely too sweet and heavy. There was so much heavy filling in the cube and only a tiny dollop of ice cream to go with it.The other dessert we had was the Cherry & Corn Sundae which was amazing. The flavors blended really well and the cherry sorbet mixed well with the chocolate cube dessert as well! I would personally prefer having the Cube served with the cherry sorbet than what it came with (mind you it was very rich and chocolatey).",3,0,1,Ellen S.,"Elmhurst, NY",36,25,25
3.0,8/7/2015,"I went with a friend two nights ago for restaurant week.  The restaurant was beautiful.  Very classy/contemporary style.  Reservations were for 6pm and we were seated immediately.  We ordered appetizers (corn gnocchi & a cheese dish), dinner ( chicken & viking scallops), dessert (mint ice cream & chocolate cube).  The food had ""interesting"" tastes, but neither my friend or I had a ""wow"" reaction.  My corn gnocchi seemed to have been deep fried and in a cream corn sauce....it was just weird.  The viking scallops were 3 medium sized (i would have expected larger for dinner) and seemed a bit too mushy.  I couldn't finish them.  The chocolate cube, which is made of some type of chocolate mousse with a side of gelato and a wafer was okay....not a chocolate lover's dream as you would expect.  The presentation of the food was however lovely, so I was quite confused that the tastes just didn't work.  I don't know if it's because it was all of the Restaurant Week menu, but I would think a restaurant would want us to sample their best so we recommend it and come again.  I maaaay try this restaurant on a normal night and order from the normal menu only because I've heard such great reviews.  But overall, I was disappointed with their restaurant week menu.",0,1,0,Jeannie A.,"Manhattan, NY",0,9,0

I had the Rose special and my girlfriend has a glass of Chardonnay. The bartender was a bit unfriendly but at least the wine pours were generous.Anyway, here's the food review:Apps:- corn gnocchi: the gnocchi was not ""airy"" as I expected. It was rather greasy and heavy but flavor was good, the corn was sweet, and the buttery foam was heavenly- burrata: the charred peaches were tasteless, burrata was burrata, roasted vegetables were a good addition, but all together it was a bit confusing. I wasn't a fan of the tomatillo salsa.Main:- dr. pepper baby back ribs: a bit too sweet for my liking, coleslaw on the side was nice with large thin slices of fennel. Big portion!- scallops: perfectly cooked, beautifully presented. The peppers added a kick.Dessert:- sticky toffee carrot cake: didn't get any carrot, it was reminiscent of popurri. It tasted more like a spice cake or a Yankee candle. But the cake was soft and moist and the ice cream on top was delicious - mint chocolate sundae: not much mint but I prefer it that way.

Started the evening at the bar being served original cocktails by Troy the bartender, who would find inspiration in our minimalist answers to ""what are you feeling.""We had a reservation for 8:30, but the staff wasn't able to seat is until 9. As it was restaurant week, I do not hold this against them. However, it did take a little too long for the waiter to actually come over and introduce himself. Good thing we were slightly satiated by the surprise snack bites of watermelon cubes and sea shell shaped cornbread with chipotle mayo. Delicious.For my appetizer I had the corn gnocchi. The gnocchi itself was OK, sauce was interesting, had an aftertaste that reminded my of nutmeg. My entree was the Dr. Pepper Baby Back Ribs and it was amazing. Out of the other entrees that my table ordered, mine was voted the best. The side salad was the perfect pairing of savory and slightly sweet.For dessert I ordered the Cherry & Corn sundae which was interesting, not bad.

The corn gnocchi was a nice mix between savory and sweet. I would highly recommend this dish. The ribs had a tangy BBQ sauce. The sundae was another standout. The fudge sauce had a hint of lavender, and underneath the ice cream was some sort of cake/crisp. Its different textures balanced out the dish well and I enjoyed the fact that it wasn't overwhelmingly sweet.Cons-- The waiters hovered too much to the point where it was overbearing.

The second you walk into the restaurant, you can smell a refreshing floral scent. The food, however, needs work -- it was honestly nothing extraordinary. Of all the food I tasted, the complimentary corn bread was probably the best. For appetizers, we ordered the Caesar Salad, Corn Gnocchi, and Soft Shell Crab ($5 Supplement). Of the three, I liked the Caesar Salad the most (for their house-made croutons), but the lettuce was bitter... Don't even bother with the Soft Shell Crab, unless you're an avid seafood lover and you must pay extra for a seafood appetizer. For main course, we ordered the Salmon and Baby Back Ribs. The Salmon was cooked to the perfect texture but it was a tad bit too salty for my taste. The Baby Back Ribs was good though!For desserts, we ordered the Mint Chocolate Sundae, Cherry & Corn Sundae, and their infamous Chocolate Cube ($5 Supplement). The Mint Chocolate Sundae and Chocolate Cube was nothing but a ticket to diabetes. THEY WERE SO SWEET! We barely touched those desserts because the intensity of sweetness was just intolerable. Huge, huge disappointment. I literally paid $5 extra to take a picture of the beautifully presented cube of diabetes. To be fair though, the Cherry & Corn Sundae was quite intelligent. I would've never imagined a fruit to go so well with a vegetable... in a dessert. The combination was just brilliant.

I have come across reviews from other restaurants where diners will get treated differently because of the discounted menu. This review is based on my most recent experience at Park Avenue Summer and does not critique the food of Park Avenue Winter.The food is amazing all around. My most recent experience was at Park Avenue Summer. They started off my meal with the complimentary cornbread with the house-made butter spread. They also provided a watermelon cube with goat cheese and basil. The appetizer I chose was the Burrata and it was made to perfection. The Charred Peach Panzanella & Tomatillo Salsa that was around made the dish pop. I got the Creekstone Skirt Steak for my entree and ordered it at a Medium-Rare temperature. It came out amazing and the flavors of the Cherry-Chipotle Glaze and Onion Rings really give the dish added flavor to round out the meal. For dessert I got the Cherry & Corn Summer Sundae. It was delicious. Too sweet for my taste as the ice cream was cherry flavored. So why did I order it you must be thinking? I wanted to try something different from my usual go to chocolate desserts. It was still a good dessert but like I said too sweet for my taste. So if you like sweet desserts than this is the dish for you!,0,0,0,Chris P.,"New York, NY",0,8,1

Tremendous wine list!   The service was good but not white table cloth professional. A little too shaky and abrupt but they all had good attitudes and were nice people. Everyone was pleased with their entrees. My kale & trout was perfectly cooked and seasoned. Nothing was extraordinary but everything was solid.,0,0,0,Justin M.,"San Diego, CA",61,96,104

It means the entire experience was amazing - from the ambiance, to the decor, to the service, to the food.I went right after they revamped to Summer. Charming red and yellow watermelon cubes embedded in grass arrive shortly after you sit down. My boyfriend and I shared the Caesar salad for which they accommodated my parmesan on the side; salmon for the entree, which was grilled to perfection, and one of the most beautifully-presented desserts I've ever had. I waited 5 min before eating it because I just wanted to look at it.",2,0,3,Annalise B.,"Cliffside Park, NJ",8,27,21

3.0,5/29/2015,"Park Avenue has been on my list for a while now. Reading menus is one of my favorite things to do and each season Park Ave has continued to capture my attention.  When summer finally rolled around and a corn heavy menu rolled out I knew it was time to go. The meal started off great, we were promptly seated by a friendly host, the decor was beautiful and our waiter knowledgeable. The amuse bouche was delicious, a cube of watermelon with a small dollop of a spiced cream. Then fresh cornbread with a light-as-air whipped chipotle butter kept the meal going in the right direction. We ordered the burrata and cured lemon caesar for appetizers,  both fine, a little disappointing and lacking something. I wouldn't order either again. For our entree we shared the corn gnocchi with a parmesan foam and fresh shaved truffle. The gnocchi was a bizarre texture, I couldn't figure out how they were cooked, baked perhaps? There was also an overpowering herb that took away from the dish and the truffle was lost. Definitely a miss for me. The stars of dinner were the potato latkes and the corn creme brulee,  I would have been fine ordering 5 creme brulees and calling it a night. We finished with the lemon merengue crepe cake with basil ice cream.  Another miss for me. Merengue on top was nice as were the blueberries with the ice cream but the cake itself fell short on flavor and texture.  To be fair I went in with high expectations,  maybe I'll try again in fall...",0,0,0,Jesse C.,"Manhattan, NY",14,5,17
5.0,5/28/2015,"I'd been meaning to have a meal at Park Avenue for the longest time, and finally did for Spring 2015. The amount of effort these guys put into updating the decor with the seasons is amazing. I literally work across the street and I've watched them take down and put up new awnings for the past three seasons.Anyway, the food is also amazing. Came here for lunch and had the grilled octopus salad. It was cooked perfectly, and the fava beans and chorizo vinaigrette were a unique pairing. Loved every bite!The place gets crowded around lunchtime, so if you don't have a reservation, get there early (around noon).

5.0,5/18/2015,"I was expecting the superbly manicured setting, I was honestly not expecting the superb meal.  The service was so good for dinner this past Friday night, we were actually wondering if the staff thought one of us was a VIP (and subsequently spent the rest of the night arguing about which one of us they thought was which celebrity).Warm tasty bread, rich crunchy truffle croquettes amuse bouche, complimentary champagne...I ordered the avocado toast, which was creamy and loaded with crab.  And they brought out a second order on the house!  Also big hits at the table: charred octopus, which I don't normally love, I would order next time; fresh hamachi tartare wih a bright pineapple relish, and nice beet salad.I shared a rabbit wellington, which was like a comforting, elevated pot pie that was light enough for spring but still stick-to-your-ribs delicious, and the halibut with truffle and brioche crusted poached egg.  Just read that over and think about it.  Good?  It's better than you imagined.Big meaty lamb chops and pork chops also graced the table; lamb was delicious, but I was not offered a bite of the pork chop (so that should probably tell you it didn't suck).Thinking of skipping dessert?  Even though the espresso machine was broken and the coffee not very good and luke warm, you MUST stay for the chocolate cube.  Description on the menu is vague, but it's devils food, and mousse, and has ancho chile sorbet, so...yeah, get it.Expensive, so for me, definitely a special occasion place, but if they deliver like this every time, it's well worth it.",1,0,1,Jeremy W.,"Hoboken, NJ",175,526,20

The bartender was very friendly and recommended special drinks for us to try. They sat us around our reservation time. For appetizer, we had the gilled octopus - which was VERY delicious, wasn't too chewy, cooked to perfection. For Entrée, I ordered the pork chop - even though it's very thick, its very juicy but a bit salty to my taste. My husband ordered the lamb chop - which comes with 2 pieces - it was So-So. For Dessert, we had the Chocolate Cube - it was $15 but totally worth it If you like chocolate.

1.0,4/28/2015,"I can barely write a review as I spent no more than 25 minutes in the restaurant. My brother and I, both in our young 20s, had a 7:30pm reservation at Park Avenue Spring this past Friday. We were on time, seated promptly, and then forgotten. Menus not offered by the hostess. We finally got menus and water. And that was the extent of our time at Park Avenue. After sitting for 20 minutes without even being acknowledged by our waiter, despite the fact both tables on either side of us were visited by wait staff, we walked out, walked to another restaurant nearby and enjoyed our replacement meal ten times more.Unsure if this lack of service was because we were young (perhaps they thought we'd be a waste of money!) or just poor communication, but it was the first time I have walked out of a restaurant.

1.0,4/16/2015,"I dined at Park Avenue Spring last night with family.  I called ahead a week in advance of our reservation to make sure they could accommodate my wheat/gluten allergy, and I was assured they could.  (Actually, I was rather brusquely told to ""look at the gluten free menu online.""  Problem is, there isn't one on their website.)Anyway, after our server made her first brief appearance and really spooned on the canned charm, she disappeared for a good 20 minutes.  When she finally materialized again and we flagged her down, hoping that she would take our drink orders and answer our menu questions, she came flying over to the table like her ass was on fire and barked ""Ready to order?"" like we were sitting in the drive-thru at Gulp N' Blow.  (At this price point, it wasn't cute or funny.)Later, when she came back to take our meal orders, she actually didn't hesitate when I asked for recommendations on gluten/wheat-free selections.  She pointed out 3 or 4 items on the menu.  But then (and this should have been my red flag) she retracted one, saying, ""Oh, not that one; it contains potatoes.""  For the uninitiated: things like wheat flour, bread, breadcrumbs, malt beverages, and soy sauce contain gluten.  Potatoes DO NOT contain gluten.  As a server at a high-end restaurant, she should have known this.I went with an appetizer and a main that both seemed safe, based upon her recommendations and the dishes' vague descriptions in the menu.  And I had a celiac reaction.If the management ever reads these reviews: moral of the story is, when customers with food allergies dine at your restaurant, we are dining with the expectation and your promise that your staff will do everything within reason to make sure the meal is safe and enjoyable.  That means properly training your servers that they should march back to the kitchen and consult the chef if they're not sure what a particular dish contains or what gluten is, for that matter.  Actually, there's no excuse in this day and age for a server at a high-end restaurant in NY not to know common food allergens.In short, the service and the experience simply do not live up to the price.  A huge fail all around for me.",9,2,1,Mike J.,"Manhattan, NY",0,25,0
1.0,4/8/2015,"I was looking forward to dining at Spring since the one that closed on Park Avenue at 61st St was a favorite. This reincarnation could not be more different or disappointing.The food was average at best. The tables were so close together that i was able to converse with my neighbor more comfortably than with my companion sitting across from me. Net net, too many tables, too close together. This is a far cry from its predecessor. The waitress was smiling but so canned a smile that it was vacant. Everything was fast, the service, the food, the busboy. We were in and out in 45 minutes flat. it felt as though we were at  darkly lit  Mcdonalds. If Wendy's starts serving King Salmon, it will be competing for my business. The price ridiculous for the quality of the food. Why the place is so busy only proves that NYC is overcrowded and enjoys not turning on the stove.

5.0,4/2/2015,"After hearing that Hurricane Club was closing, I was absolutely devastated. Goodbye beautiful watermelon drink. Goodbye Pupu Platter. But then when I heard that it was going to be replaced by Park Avenue, I was ecstatic, as it is definitely one of my favorite restaurants in NYC. You win some, you lose some, amirite? That's life. I've always loved Park Avenue, but that trek from Battery Park made it difficult for me to go as often as I would have liked. That is why I am loving this new, much more convenient location. Hallelujah.Seeing as how my family has never been able to experience the wonder that is Park Avenue, I decided to take them here for brunch one Sunday. Immediately upon sitting down and ordering, we were given the most sinful Cinnamon Monkey Rolls which were served with a side of cream cheese frosting, salt-roasted pecans and rum raisins. Warm and decadent, the monkey rolls were a perfect way to start the morning. Their fresh-squeezed orange juice was also so fresh and so good. My only wish was that it could have been bottomless.I ordered the Smoked Salmon + Bucatini as my appetizer and was blown away by how much I enjoyed this. The salmon had the perfect amount of smokiness to it and was only complemented by the wasabi caviar, which I decided is my new favorite thing. The bucatini was delicious as well and only heightened by the creme fraiche accompanying it. I would have bowls and bowls of this if I could. My brother also ordered the bucatini and loved it as much as me, while my mother ordered the Breakfast Risotto and my dad had the Stone Cut Oats + Almonds. While both were tasty, I was impressed with the oats, which our waiter shaved 70% dark chocolate on top of after serving it. The combination was unlike anything I expected--simply put, it was a pleasant surprise. For my entree, I got the Avocado + Eggs Benedict, which I enjoyed. Not to the same extent as I enjoyed my appetizer, but I liked it nonetheless. Love avocado more than anything, so was definitely a big fan of the nice helping I was served with my eggs. I also enjoyed the unique take of the hollandaise, which had a nice little kick to it as a result of the jalapeño in it. The toast it was served on was a little crunchier than I would have liked, but other than that, I was quite pleased. The rest of my family ordered the Everything-Crusted Branzino, the Flatironer and Park Avenue Oeufs Mollets, all of which were amazing as well. Major shoutout to the branzino, which I was not expecting to love as much as I did. The Potato Latkes were also decent.

It was definitely a sign of a great lunch to come. We were given Complimentary Rosemary Bread. A simple bread topped with rosemary. Fresh warm bread. Rosemary went very great with it. It was good piece of bread. For appetizers 1. We started off the The Park Avenue Winter Seared Scallop ""Sandwich."" Mmm..Mmm... It wasn't really a sandwich. They put the bread on the bottom and then put the scallops on top. It was so delicious. The scallops was fresh. Seared just perfectly. Great flavor. 2. Peekytoe Crabcake with Citrus & Hearts of Palm. The crab cake was perfection. Amazingly delicious. What incredible flavors in the crab cake. Entrees. 3. Everything-Crusted Branzino with Smoked Cream Cheese, Pickled Onions. They give you two pieces of Branzino. It was crusty on the outside and so moist on the inside. Everything just worked well with the Branzino. It is a recommended dish to get. 4. Braised Short Rib Sandwich with Horseradish & Gorgonzola. The ribs was filled with flavor. It moist, juicy, and tender. You do not need the knife to cut into the short ribs. Salad complimented very well with the short ribs. A lovely sweet and citrus salad. Desserts.5. Winter White Sundae with Popcorn Ice Cream, Coconut & White Mocha Sauce. I had to go with the flow because it is winter theme. Had to be the best ice creams I ever tasted. The ice cream had to be freshly made. It was smooth, creamy, and tasty. The coconut & white mocha sauce was SO YUMMY!!!6. Sticky Toffee Pudding. This dessert was just heavenly. Every bite was orgasmic. Moist, sweet, and just makes you want more more more. You have to get this!!!Presentation of every dish was absolutely beautiful. The portion size was just perfect. The food was absolutely fantastic.

It's fine for 2, but a table of 4 nearby was also given the same serving of these 4 small rolls, which is definitely not enough. They tasted delicious, though.We then had the stone cut oats with almonds and the breakfast risotto with mushrooms, sausage and bacon. Both were really good, but the risotto was the winner here. I'm always torn between sweet and savory for brunch, but go with savory on this one.For our mains, we had the cafe au lait french toast and the flatironer (short rib and veggie + potato hash).

The truffle croquettes were also very nice to start off our meal.

I think if they reduced the saltiness, the dish would've been very flavorful and perfect. Main Entree: Everything-Crusted Branzino - my favorite dish out of the entire meal. The smoked cream cheese and pickled onions that the Branzino comes with, were amazing compliments to the fish. The texture was great and overall I recommend this dish!

The Cauliflower T-Bone actually looked really good and smelled delicious too (someone next to me ordered it and I was creeping haha).Dessert: Salted Pistachio Sundae - this dessert finished my dinner off nicely.

It's like a superstar quarterback who retires and the upstart new QB for the franchise just isn't up to par that meets their predecessor.I've been to the old establishment and the one main highlight is the seasonal decor of the restaurant and the ambiance. Here it fails miserably. It didn't even seem to match the seasonal decor but had instead a regular restaurant theme decor. The meal also didn't stand out. Basic fare that didn't wow me. They even recycled the house parker rolls that came from the previous tenant here of  General Assembly. Had the fish which was standard fare with a sauce that didn't stand out. The schnitzel pork chop was fried up well though and did match up with the apple slices. The desserts of a white sundae can be easily skipped.

Eventually a bus boy brought us bread, but still no waiter.My girlfriend is a vegetarian and can't eat eggs and the complete lack of understanding to accommodate this when it came to the menu selection was highly unsatisfactory, no substitution unless being charged extra!! ""Can we take out the chorizo in this dish and replace with mushroom""... ""Sure, for an extra $7"". Not sure I see the logic in that.We asked for the chef's options. The waiter came back with a non-vegetarian salad... When that was pointed out they said ok, so we can do lettuce with oil and vinegar... For $32. For a restaurant this nice, you would expect a chef to be more inventive and have even one option other than lettuce with oil. The waiter ended with, ""well eat the bread."" No imagination no customer service not even busy at the time. To say we are disappointed is a barely cracking the ice Needless to say we left.

3.0,3/1/2015,"I've been to the uptown location before and this was the first time at Park Avenue's new downtown space. The room was well decorated and the service was great. However we had an early reservation and despite all of the space available the hostess sat us right next to another couple.  Also, as it was restaurant week we planned to take advantage of the RW2015 menu, but were told that it wasn't available that night. This information was not posted anywhere or mentioned at any point while making our reservation or when they called to comfirm our reservation. The drinks were fantastic, as was the oxtail orrechietti. We ordered a side of the broccoli with cheetos out of curiosity, but we were disappointed. There was nothing creative or interesting about it - literally cheetos sprinkled over broccoli and cheese. Our entrees were well done, not bursting with flavor (I actually used the salt on the table). I had the short ribs and he had the duck.

4.0,2/27/2015,"Excellent deal for Restaurant Week Winter 2015. $38 for what normally would have been almost $60 worth of food. The portion sizes were not skimpy, either - I couldn't even finish my entree or my dessert.I started with the seared scallop ""sandwich"" (it's more of a crostini than a sandwich, except with soggier bread). The scallops themselves tasted perfect, topped with crumbly, delicious bits of (what I think was) bacon, potato, peppers, and other goodness. Went with the chicken for my entree, which was also well-prepared, and as I mentioned, larger than I expected. For dessert I tried the winter white sundae - drizzled in white mocha sauce with bits of coconut and popcorn. Beautiful ambiance, particularly in the main dining room. The service was excellent too.

3.0,2/25/2015,"I came here for Winter Restaurant Week 2015. I know that I should not judge a restaurant by its RW dishes, but the dishes that I had are all on the regular menu.The atmosphere in the restaurant was great -- it was lively, but I didn't feel overwhelmed by noise...the space is huge. The decorations and menus change by the season -- it was Park Avenue Winter when I went for dinner.We did the $38 Restaurant Week menu -- an excellent deal, considering some of the dishes were nearly that price alone. I also really appreciated that that offered drink deals (we got a bottle of wine for $39).We asked our waiter if there was any chance that we could trade our two desserts for an extra appetizer instead, because my boyfriend was not eating dessert for Lent. This wasn't possible, and I understand that -- but our waiter was very awkward/uncomfortable about us asking. I was not pleased with our waiter throughout our experience -- he did not do much to make us feel welcome in the restaurant.We tried the following items:- The Park Avenue Winter Seared Scallop Sandwich -- this was really good -- it was probably the best dish, in my opinion- Peekytoe Crabcake - this was fine. The flavors were a little strange together, and the crabmeat was not as high quality as I expected. The greens in the citrus really pulled the flavors together though- Everything-Crusted Branzino - I liked the idea of this dish, but it didn't work together as well as I would have hoped. The smoked cream cheese seemed like a random afterthought under the branzino, and while I love everything bagels, the ""everything crust"" was a little too much. It overpowered the dish.- Braised Shortrib - I liked this, but it was really salty and really heavy -- neither my boyfriend nor I could finish our portion of the dish. - Winter White Sundae- Sticky Toffee PuddingBoth of the desserts were pretty good. I only had a couple bites of each because I was full from the short rib, but they were creative and they were presented well.I had really high hopes for Park Avenue Autumn/Winter/Spring/Summer, and was so excited to try it when it opened. However, it really wasn't anything special-- it seemed as though the food relied too heavily on seasoning and not enough on the actual quality of the ingredients.I would pass my below-expectations experience off as a Restaurant Week fluke, but I don't really think Restaurant Week is an excuse to skimp on quality.

Boy, was I wrong. After we were seated, we waited for 5 minutes and nobody came to give us the menu or water. We had to wave somebody to our table (after trying for another 3 minutes). Our table had bread crumbs on it for some reason and one of the knifes was dirty.

Shared the scallop sandwich and kale salad as our appetizers. Both very tasty. Our entrees were crusted Bronzino and short rib sandwich.

4.0,2/21/2015,"Came here for restaurant week 2015.1- scallops were delicious.  The bread that came with it was good too but I could have done without it.  They slice the scallops so it's not a lot, but it's delicious. 2- buttery side bread also delicious.  Soft. Warm.  And fluffy- like challah bread. 3-Branzino. Usually don't do fish but the crusty seed crackers that came with it complemented it perfectly. Also love the strips of salmon cream cheese and a greenish sauce.4- popcorn ice cream. Disappointed. It's basically vanilla ice cream w a few pop corns and a bland piece of cake at bottom. Can't taste the white mocha.  Took me half the cup to enjoy the flavor.. Side note/ a few items have an extra charge.  Why put it on restaurant week menu then?

4.0,2/21/2015,"RW2015 Menu blew me away.  I visited during lunch with other 3 colleagues and we were very satisfied.INTERIOR: Gorgeous space and decor.  Restaurant beautifully divided into 4-5 dining sections.  We were in the main area which decorated with beautiful twigs, tree branches, and light glass globes .. perfect for winter theme.  It was very romantic.  Great for taking your dates here.FOOD:PEEKYTOE CRABCAKE - Hands down, one of the best crabcake I've ever had.  It served with a light and refreshing citrus & hearts of palm salad.  Crabcake itself was fulled of lump crabmeat.  It was crispy on top and packed with such great flavor.  Every bite I took, I just couldn't believe how tasty it was.  Citrus salad was a great compliment to crabcake.  I recommend you try this awesome appetizer!  I did try a bite of seared scallop sandwich.  It was also good, but didn't blow me away.EVERYTHING-CRUSTED BRANZINO - 2 generous pieces of branzino were laid on top of smoked cream cheese and topped with pickled onions.  Another wonderful dish.  Fish was crispy on outer layer, but perfectly moist on the meat.  Beautifully presented on the plate.  Smoked cream cheese was light.  It was in a liquid form, not your chunk of cream cheese you put on a bagel.  Two thumbs up!  Other colleagues of mine got Amish Chicken and Braised Short Rib sandwich.  I didn't try the chicken, however I did have a bite of braised short rib.  It was a really big portion.  I wasn't a fan of braised short rib because I didn't like gorgonzola taste mixed with the meat.  It overpowered the meat a bit.  IF you are a fan of gorgonzola, you might enjoy this dish.SALTED PISTACHIO SUNDAE - it wasn't anything spectacular, but it was good.  Great end to our meal.SERVICE: So-so I must say.  Service isn't as top-notch as A VOCE next door.  I don't recall anyone checked up on us whether we need anything or if we were enjoying ourselves .. which I don't really mind as long as my water is filled.  Food came out really quickly so quick that I didn't get a chance to finish my appetizer.  At one point, I had an empty plate in front of me and waitstaff brought us food .. instead of having someone take my empty plate away, a waitstaff just kind of looked at me like 'move the plate over or I'm just going to put food on top of it'.  Small little things count which is why it hasn't yet reach 5 stars for me.  Nonetheless  .. it was a very satisfying dining experience.",5,0,2,Kim S.,"Stamford, CT",206,235,454

This is my favorite FAVORITE most highly recommended spot for RW, and this year the food just didn't deliver. Perhaps it's what I ordered... But in any case maybe this will help you guys when picking a RW this year. Apps:Crab cake : best thing about RW week here is that they don't skimp on portion sizes, so this was a great size for an individual. Good. Scallop sandwich: has bread! I shouldn't have been surprised but I was lol.  It's very buttery so it fills you up... Lovely scallops and yum with the bacon bits and jalapeños. Best part of meals were apps....... Downhill from here :/ Entrees:Braised short ribs: oddly the interior was on the dry side, and lacking in taste. I would be actually pissed if it cost $37 for just this entree and it tasted like this. Pork chop snitzel: shame on me for not asking how it was made. It's deep fried which I think killed the deliciousness the meat itself could offer. The breading was flavored well and honestly... It was just ok overall. Desserts: Ice cream. Ok they just offered a giant scoops of ice cream who wanna eat that in 9 degree nyc weather? Sigh, I miss those uniquely made delicious dessert creations I knew park ave for.Otherwise this restaurant is just as uniquely beautiful, even more spacious than its midtown location.

4.0,2/20/2015,"Decided to pick this restaurant for restaurant week because they are pretty unique that their decorations changes according to the season. Wanted to make a dinner reservation but they had no openings any day around 7 or 8 pm.  Came here for lunch instead.  The restaurant week lunch menu is similar to the dinner except a steak tartare for app and a califlower t-bone and halibut being available on the dinner menu.  We started off by having some complimentary bread which was good but very buttery.    It was good but not as good as how people descirbe it.  For apps we had the roasted butternut squash soup and the kale and manchego salad.  The nuts were in the bowl and they pour the soup from a pot right in front of you.  For the salad, they brought out a bowl to see how much honey you want to put on top.  The soup was tasty and not overly salty.  Salad was a pretty decent size and tasted really fresh.  For entree we had everything crusted branzino and braised short rib sandwich.  The braised short rib sandwich came with a small salad which consisted of arugula and apple slices.  The sandwich was an open faced sandwich and the meat was flavorful and delicious.  They gave 2 good sized pieces of the branzino.  Wasn't too fishy and surprisingly good since I don't really like eating fish.  The cream cheese that it came with, paired deliciously with the branzino.  For dessert we had the salted pistachio sundae and the winter white sundae.  The pistachio sundae was good but not enough pistachio taste. There were actual pistachio nuts in the ice cream.  The appearance of the winter white sundae was better but didn't taste as good as the pistachio sundae.Overall service at this restaurant was good and friendly.  Food came out at a good pace.

5.0,2/19/2015,"The Quick:  A really exquisite, romantic meal. Everything was spot on delicious at a beautiful venue. The Details: You know the meal is going to be good when the complementary bread and truffle coquettes are delicious. We went for restaurant week and absolutely loved everything we had... Plus the portions were normal size.  I had the steak tartare to start, which is served on toasted baguette and covered in a delicious cheese. I had the pork schnitzel for my entrée which was a very generous portion, fried to perfection (and very juicy) and served with a  delicious pear purée. To start, my date had the crab cake which was a overwhelming percentage of crab (very flavorful) served with a   great citrus salad. For his entrée he had the short ribs which was cooked to perfection in a great sauce,  and was good amount of food. For dessert I had the pistachio sundae which was just okay, while his toffee bread pudding was creamy and covered in a great caramel sauce. Both of our meals were  fantastic, I would absolutely come back to have these again. The venue was extremely romantic and perfect for ""winter"" with hanging lights and interesting trees.The Damage: We went for restaurant week so I was $38 a person plus my steak tartare was a $5 supplement. Overall a good deal. Looking at the regular menu, we probably would've spent about $100 without drinks for a similar amount of food. Either way not crazy, but of course not a cheap meal.

5.0,2/19/2015,I recently stopped into Park Avenue Winter to try the Restaurant week lunch menu and it was very good. I started with Kale and Manchego Salad with Chorizo and Chestnut Honey. The salad had amazing flavors with the crunch and saltiness from the Chorizo and the sweetness from the Chesnut Honey. This was one of the best Kale salads I have had.For Entree I had the Short Rib Sandwich. This is an open faced sandwich with a good amount of short rib and grilled onions on top of large piece of brioche with horseradish and gorgonzola. There was a nice salad next to the sandwich with apples. The one warning on the sandwich is that the horseradish was somewhat overwhelming when you get to the bread and took over the flavor.For desert I tried the Sticky Toffee Pudding which was really a light cake on top of grilled bananas with some toffee. This was another very tasty dish and positive end to meal.Overall Park Avenue Winter offers one of the best options in the area for Restaurant week. The feed was all very good and the service was attentive. I will make this my go to option near the office for client lunches!,0,1,2,Brendan C.,"Wilton, CT",122,38,8

Vodka, grapefruit, a spice of some sort & huge piece of salted ice. Incredible. We are all foodie types so we decided to do family style for all the courses. The staff was absolutely amazing; friendly & informed. Art was our main server and he was phenomenal, as was the rest of the staff. They were on top of the table without being intrusive & put up with our loud group :)From the starters the Ricotta gnocchi, Oxtail Orecchiette & scallops were very good. I was a little disappointed in the octopus. We were all looking forward to it but it kind of missed the mark, just didnt have a lot of flavour, but lovely presentation.I'm almost positive we tried almost all of the entrees on the menu, devoured our combined weight in meat and fish dishes. The Long Island Duck was SO good! It was tender & flavourful & cooked to perfection.The Halibut was also really yummy... and the one we were all curious about: Broccoli & Cheetos. This was a personal favourite. Genius. It was like the best drunk-food-idea cleaned up and improved on...and so simple. Why have I not thought of it before?! All of the dishes had a great balance of seasonal veggies and protein. The portions were large so don't let the price frighten you, all well worth it.Desserts were beautiful.

The entrees of note were the dover sole special, and a truly creative everything crusted branzino.  The Dover sole was not served table side the traditional way.  But they still captured the essence of it- hot butter sauce and lemon on the side, really crisp and light croutons and hazelnuts on top.  The everything branzino was basically a fish version of an everything bagel.  So clever and it tasted just like that!  The dishes were perfectly delicious.  Perhaps a little too generous- portions were huge and we struggled to finish them.Dessert was equally solid and we shared a chocolate cube.  The entire meal was satisfying.  Seems like they will participate in restaurant week- hope they get a lot of new customers.  I would definitely come back here again.  Hope it stays this time.",1,1,1,Jenny A.,"Manhattan, NY",0,3,0

2.0,2/1/2015,"Went there last night with a group of 12 for a wedding shower celebration. I must say that I don't often give reviews, only if a restaurant is inspiring or disappointing. Unfortunately, in this case it was disappointing. First the good. It is a very nice space and the service was good. But the main event is always the food. Here is where it fell short. Can't speak for all at the seating but none of my immediate family were impressed with their meal. I had the pork chop. It was pounded and breaded with Panko then pan fried . It came out warm not hot and the Panko was coated on both sides rendering the breading as thick as the pounded meat. So as you can imagine this was way too much breading.It tasted as though it was deep fried like food I might eat back in my college days.Dry and firm, NOT succulent and juicy.My wife had the duck and it came out as two rectangles of duck filet. It had none of the normal appearance or intriguing flavor of savory duck breast but rather it was bland. My daughter had the Chateaubriand and again while she found it acceptable, the texture and flavor profile were unremarkable if not below average. The potato pancakes were absolutely too salty, and seemed to have been fried sometime earlier in the evening. That was a big disappointment since I really love the ones my mother used to make. I will add a positive note about the gnocchi and truffle appetizer in that it was delicate and tasty. However the portion size  is pretty sparse.So overall since there are so many other choice in NYC we will not be back. Sorry!",2,0,0,Peter F.,"Harrisburg, PA",1,11,6
4.0,1/24/2015,"Came here last night with my boyfriend and we had a delicious meal. This was my third time at this location and it's the third restaurant! First Hurricane Club, then General Assembly, now Park Avenue Winter. I hope it stays! The decor is beautiful with winter branches covering the ceiling. The place is huge and we were able to snag a reservation same day on a Friday night. They had a special appetizer of the night which was ricotta gnocchi with shaved black truffle on it. The truffle didn't taste like truffle so i'm not quite sure what it was. The portion was tiny so it wasn't worth it. We also had the kale manchego salad which was fine- had a nice smokey flavor from the pancetta but not amazing and again not worth the price.For the entree, I really enjoyed my halibut that came with a brioche egg. This dish definitely tasted like truffle and thought the egg was really unique the way it was covered in some kind of dough. My boyfriend enjoyed his short ribs. We had the pistachio sundae for dessert which came with a warm caramel sauce and a butter cookie at the bottom. I thought the ice cream was solid because it had whole pistachios in the ice cream! My entree and the dessert were my favorites and thought overall it was a solid meal!",5,0,2,Leslie H.,"New York, NY",346,340,151
4.0,1/19/2015,"This place is delicious although the service this past Saturday night was a little off. We showed up 5 minutes early for our 9:00pm reservation for 3 and they sent us to wait a few moments at the bar. We didn't feel like drinking yet so we just lingered around and 25 minutes later, no sign of our table. I walked over to the host for an update and he said 'they were just clearing out our table'. We eventually got seated and I ordered the Arctic Char, and my friends had the Chicken and the Halibut with Poached egg & goat cheese. The strange thing was that our food came out before our cocktails. When the manager made her rounds to check up on us, I just mentioned that everything tasted amazing but our drinks never made it. She quickly motioned our server over and brought them out right away on the house. I thought this was great service recovery and the drink issue won't deter me from returning here. My Arctic Char with a blood orange glaze was fresh and citrus-y just the way I had hoped. My friend's Halibut was delicious too and while the thought of having a poached egg for dinner sounded strange at first, she said it was great when paired with the fish and goat cheese.

We got a lot of appetizers and sides to share: broccoli with Cheetos, brussels sprouts, scallops, crab cakes, kale salad, and the flatbread croissant pizza. The pizza was INCREDIBLE, whatever you do order this app. It has bacon, brussels sprouts and lots of cheese and is on a delicious flaky puff pastry/croissant. I was not the biggest fan of the broccoli with Cheetos, but everything else was delicious. For my entree I got the halibut, which was seasoned very well and came with truffles and a poached egg! This was a very good combination of flavors. Drink wise, I got the Road to Jericho which is similar to a moscow mule and comes in one of those cool steel cups w/pomegranate seeds on top too, yum! We also had 2 bottles of red wine at the table which the waiter recommended, cannot remember the names but they were great! Definitely want to come back here to try all the other seasons!

Lol.  We split the Halibut with black truffles and a brioched egg that was buttery soft and delish.  Yes I like truffles on everything!  I was curious about the Chateaubriand but had dinner the next day at STK and didn't want to overdo the red meat.  We also decided to get the side of potato latkes that were beyond crunchy and addicting.",1,1,0,Sascha M.,"New York, NY",593,822,7

I went for lunch last week, and I really enjoyed my meal here.  I liked the decor, and the space is pretty open and bright.  It was a bit noisy, but not so much that you couldn't have a conversation.  Our waiter was funny, knowledgeable and patient enough to explain almost every item on the menu for us.  I started with a cocktail.  I believe it was called the Road to Jericho, and it was served in a cooper mug, Moscow mule style, and had pomegranate seeds.  It was very refreshing!  I shared the crab cake appetizer with my dad, which was very good.  It had a crispy outside, but wasn't too oily or overly fried, and had a nice citrus salad on the side.  My mom and her friend shared a kale salad, which was good, but a kale salad, so not amazing.  Then I had the cauliflower steak which was very good, and had a cute like toothpick sticking out that said medium, as if it had been a real steak.  We got brussel sprouts to share for the table, and they even brought us the potato latkes, which were mini, but so good!  And the rosemary sauce that accompanied them was amazing.  Everyone else enjoyed their main dishes.  My mom had ordered the scallop sandwich, which apparently is small and more of an appetizer sized portion, so she changed her order, but the waiter came back and said the kitchen  would make it full size for her. So that was nice, and accommodating!   We shared the chocolate cube for dessert, we were stuffed, but it sounded so good, and the presentation was very pretty... and we devoured it.

The chateaubriand was absolutely not worth $48 pp.  The meat itself was good, but the foie gras stuffing was gross (it was dipped in batter and deep fried to the point where I couldn't taste any foie gras...I'm still not sure if it was even in there), and it also came with some greens that had so much dressing on top that they were inedible. The service was poor - our water glasses were refilled maybe once during the course of the meal, our waiter pulled a disappearing act, and the drink I ordered took an extremely long time to arrive.  In the restaurant's defense, however, they did comp the drink.Maybe Winter is their worst season, but I won't be back during the rest of the year to confirm.",1,0,1,Sonalee J.,"Manhattan, NY",0,11,1

3.0,12/7/2014,"So I'll start by saying that this restaurant is absolutely beautiful, magical almost.  Everything is a delightful winter theme (can't wait to try the other seasons) with light / white colors filling the airy space.  The waiters and waitresses had ""winter"" emblazoned on their aprons / uniforms.  I'm fascinated by the concept of renaming their restaurant after the season (Park Avenue Autumn, Winter, Spring...you get the point)The three of us ordered the prix fixe brunch, for $32.  We had the caesar salad and the salmon pasta for our appetizers, and the coffee bread and branzino entrees.  We also got the monkey bread.I ordered a bellini with the winter kumquat, and we got the potato pancakes and bacon sides (both good).  For dessert, we received (on the house) their popcorn ice cream (very good!)None of the above names are the right names for dishes, as they all had fancy french names on the menu.  Here's the rundown:Bellini - my first one ever - was delightful.  I liked the tall glass they served it in, and they dropped a fermented kumquat that sank to the bottom of the glass.  At $9, it was well-worth the price.Monkey bread - call me unrefined, but isn't this a cinnamon frosted bun?  It was really good, with toasted nuts and rum raisin (not that rummy), and the frosting was replaced with a classy cream cheese frosting alternative.  Salmon pasta - came with wasabi caviar (wow, pretty good) and shreds of smoked salmon.  The noodles were a bit underseasoned, even after mixing everything in.  I wish there was a bit of pepper / salt.  Caesar salad - very good, no complaints, and the shredded pickled onions were top-notch.Coffee bread - well-seasoned, textured almost like a bread pudding.  I wish there was a little more variety (good thing I didn't order this one) because toward the end of it, I would probably want to try something else.Branzino - this was called ""everything crusted"" - came on a bed of white creamy sauce, and there was this green oil drizzled around it as well.  It was not very much fish, but was well-cooked.  The everything crust was delicious.So why would I give this place 3 stars instead of 4 or 5?  Most of the food was good, yes, but we waited 30 minutes between our appetizers and entrees.  It didn't help that my party was discussing a controversial and uncomfortable issue, and so 30 minutes felt like 90 minutes - though that's definitely not the restaurant's fault!  The gentleman who was our waiter was somewhat rude - well, straddled the line between curt and rude.  He was very good about making sure we always had water.The manager stopped by near the end of our meal, and asked how everything was - which was nice - and when we told her about the wait time, she urged us to try the popcorn ice cream on the house.  We agreed (yay free food!) but waited another 25 minutes for it.  When our waiter brought us the dessert, my plate had a bunch of fingerprints on it (eww) and two of the spoons were sticky on the handle (double eww!)To make matters worse, the waiter split our bill wrong (but I didn't have the heart to ask him to re-run the check because I had just asked him for a new plate and spoons...) So my roommate ended up paying 2/3 of the bill - fine with me, to be honest! Overall, I'd come back here in the spring to see what it's about.  The decor was beautiful, and I was pleasantly surprised about the price point (was expecting to pay more).  This restaurant was also featured in the Wall Street Journal here: wsj.com/articles/at-park…I think they just opened back in Autumn (relocated from their old location) and so this is only their second cycle in a few months.  I really hope they work out the kinks.  I think there's a major disconnect between the great concept of seasonal restaurants, and the execution of the plan.  I'll be back in the spring after I hibernate!  Major food coma...",0,0,0,Calvin L.,"Chicago, IL",684,59,2

The soup was delish, I wouldn't know how the fried shrimp salad was since there was no shrimp in the salad we received. When we received entrees we were told they ran out of broccoli and Cheetos side dish, great timing. My Halibut tasted fine, the Bronzino was interesting with a nice crunch however the mood was spoiled with so many more issues with service and food that I won't continue.

But the kitchen got it right last night).  The schnitzel pork was a bit dry but that's a hard one to get right even in the top tier kitchens.  I'll forgive it.  What was less forgivable was the spotty service.  We had to send a bus boy in search of our waiter twice.   Also, we were seated in the ancillary dining area - no the main one - adjacent to the bar and next to a nosy serving station.  As a semi ""regular"", I didn't expect that.  Clearly our seating privileges didn't carry to the new location.  Also, the space, while nicely appointed, lacked the warmth and glow of the prior location.  Beyond that, the selection of house flavorings for cocktails - a signature of the old Park Avenue location - are not available anymore.  ""Maybe try us at brunch"" the bartender said coyly.  I returned a polite but noncommittal ""Maybe.""     And the lovely bathroom linens from the old location have been replaced with paper in the new location.  I understand why they did it but it's not a step forward.  I'll try again in the Spring when the kinks are worked out.  There are too many right now to rush back for the Winter menu.",0,0,0,Justin K.,"Manhattan, NY",0,11,0

5.0,10/27/2014,"I have to admit I went in on a whim, but I couldn't be happier that I did.  The decor is perfect, especially for this time of year.  Throughout the meal, I felt like I was whisked away to the country and its beautiful foliage.  We started out with the crispy shrimp, which was fresh and flavorful.  For my main course, I chose the skirt steak.  This steak could have been cut with a fork, it was that tender.  I highly recommend this steak to any self-respecting carnivorous male who loves a good steak.  That's not to say that a woman wouldn't gush over the skirt steak as well, but my lady friend fell in love with the scallops.No matter what your choice is for your main course, all meals MUST end with the Autumn Sundae.  If you think girls go crazy for pumpkin spice lattes, you need to taste this perfect concoction of pumpkin, ice cream, and caramel...the ultimate fall guilty pleasure!*Disclaimer: This review is to the best of my recollection, considering I ALSO indulged in a few ""Take Three"" bourbon, maple syrup, blackberry and lemon cocktails....another must!",4,2,2,Andrew M.,"Brooklyn, NY",10,6,0

5.0,10/24/2014,"I've been to Park Avenue Autumn 3 times now and cannot say enough great things. The restaurant is beautiful and has a wonderful ""seasonal"" feeling of autumn that you feel as soon as you walk in the door (complete with a Fall video projection above the hostess station). Food: The venison tartare is UNBELIEVABLE. May be one of the best apps on the menu. It's sizable though and meant for two, though I could have eaten it for my entire meal. As an entree, the scallops get 5 stars. You get 5 large scallops with a black sesame sauce, which is perfectly paired. Never tasted anything like this! The sides don't disappoint and the worst part is wanting to have them all. The broccoli and Cheetos, latkes and brussel sprouts are all delicious. And dessert...oh dessert! Get the chocolate cube. You may have to rolled out of the restaurant but it's worth it. Service: EXCELLENT! Our waiter was super attentive and thoroughly walked us through the specials and answered all of my questions without hesitation. I mean, most people may wonder why such a great restaurant has Cheetos on the menu! I never had an empty glass of water (which is very important to me) and the coffee came right with my dessert (also important to me).

The interior decor is like nowhere else in the city where at time you forget your dining inside, orange leaves, candles and fall scents fill the place. Our server was very friendly and talkative and even gave us a little history of the place. I started with a butternut squash soup which was delicious and myself and my girlfriend got the branzinni  which was like nothing I had ever tasted before, sitting atop a coconut cream sauce. The bathrooms might be the cleanest and most pleasant smelling in the entire city, I felt I had to comment.

Designed by the legends at AvroKO, the beautiful art-nouveau inspired interiors is stunning, from the massive lighting centerpiece installations to the wooden wall details of the lower level.

3.0,10/10/2014,"I'm really REALLY sad to write this review. Park Avenue back when it was on the UES was my favorite restaurant in NYC. I even went there on New Year's Eve when it was their last day before closing. Now that it's moved to this location where it used to be General Assembly (which I also gave 3 stars), the quality has decreased tremendously. I was looking forward to its opening, starting with Autumn since that was my first experience at Park Avenue years ago. I remember being wowed by every dish and amazed at the freshness of each ingredient so intricately placed onto the dish. What happened to the creativity? What happened to the fresh ingredients? Where's the innovation? I remember the complimentary bread being super tasty and with every season, I was amazed at what they could do with a mundane item, how they made me yearn for more. This pumpkin bread with pumpkin seeds lacked flavor, only with the amazing maple butter did the bread come alive. That's not how it used to be. Before, the bread could stand alone. And butter only enhanced its magic. Steak was just steak. With lots of greens on top. Shrimp salad was too acidic; the crispy shrimp being the only good part. Hamachi did not stand out at all. Their long time staple, the potato latkes, was still good. The decor is still lovely, though. And service was superb!

3.0,10/1/2014,"My review comes at more than just a little delay, since General Assembly has just been formally replaced by Park Avenue Autumn. It is the same space where Hurricane Club and Hurricane Steak & Sushi once stood, before it's eventual transformation into General Assembly Restaurant & Bar, a ""modern American"" restaurant that recieved mostly positive early responses. When the latest season of restaurant week rolled around, a few friends and I chose to have dinner here after being won over by the menus.Perhaps it's best if I gloss over the meal (there will no benefit for anyone from reading the review of an already deceased restaurant), but I will say that the space was transformed into a bustling, upscale dining area, perfect for a night out with friends or even a date. Prior perusals of the menu ensured that we spent only a few minutes finalizing our choices and once orders were taken, we started on some of the complimentary monkey bread from the restaurant, which was generously seasoned with herbs and paired with butter.My appetizer that evening was the Gnocchi and Scallops, a dish that paired plump and surprisingly light gnocchi pasta against slivers of Viking Village Scallops. The accompanying bacon beurre blanc that had hints of tartness and smokiness, all flavors that melded well with the proteins. I have to admit I was very happy with the addition of sliced jalapenos for spice and crisp potato ""croutons"" and chives for texture; overall, a creative and well-conceptualized dish that ended up being the highlight of the meal for me.I'd decided on the Landaff Cheddar Burger as my main, which was served with a side of fries and an impressive pile of arugula. The burger, which I'd requested cooked to a medium, was much closer to a well done, which lost a fair amount of flavor and juiciness from an otherwise tasty patty. It was only partially saved by the delightfully melted slice of cheddar and the additional spread of Sundried Tomato Relish and Dijonaise. A more substantial bun would have been appreciated as well, as the thin layers of bread weren't entirely able to support the protein, and made the final few bites considerably messier than they needed to be.Dessert that night gave us the option of an eclair or gelato, and most of us opted for the latter. I chose the Lemon-Blueberry Chiffon, a lightly sweetened and tart scoop of gelato that was draped in a few mascerated blueberries. The several other desserts I tried, including a refreshing Apple-Ginger sorbet, and a decadent Espresso Brownie sundae drizzled in dulche de leche were all satisyfing, if not simple, treats.In hindsight, General Assembly was a significant improvement to its overly showy and glitzy predecessors. I'm hopeful that Park Avenue is yet another step in the right direction, especially given the positive dining experience I had at the venue's original UES location.",12,3,4,Lori L.,"New York, NY",2244,608,6827
4.0,10/1/2014,"So glad this restaurant is back!The 2014 Autumn menu is great - lots of options that bring in the flavors of the season. The drink list and wines by the glass are also a treat.The new space (formerly General Assembly and before that Hurricane Club) is bigger and brighter than the old uptown spot, and the vibe really works. Less stuffy, for sure.Our waiter Bradford was already up to speed on the whole menu and made some great recommendations on what's good to share/pair etc.Only reason not 5 stars is that the overall bill adds up to a bit pricier than it really feels like it should.

4.0,9/30/2014,"The re-opened establishment in Stillman's old General Assembly location(even by website url!), Park Avenue Autumn is well known for its seasonally changing decor and menu options. The newest iteration of the restaurant has returning chef Zene Flinn and welcomes Benkei O'Sullivan, formerly of ABC Kitchen. Redesigned  to be more casual and accessible in its new park avenue south location, Park Avenue Autumn still evokes the colors and flavors of autumn through its food and atmosphere.Went for a late evening seating this past Saturday and had an opportunity to try the Autumn Haystack w/ Crispy Shrimp, Seared Diver Scallops, and Duck Fat Potatoes.The autumn haystack was probably my favorite dish of the group, being very crisp and refreshing with the crispy shrimp providing a good complement of flavor and texture.The seared diver scallops were well cooked, although the black sesame sauce added an uncomfortable granularity to each bite, as if there were sand.The duck fat potatoes were fine, although a bit on the dry side.Was not particularly impressed by the service, which was somewhat disruptive and intrusive during the meal when taking in and out dishes. The atmosphere was fairly energetic and a little noisier than I had anticipated, product of perhaps the placement of our table in a more sectioned off dining area, and the more casual vibe. I think with a number of choices gone better, including opting for the skirt steak over the scallops (note: a taste of the pork chop snitzel was fantastic), and a better dinner seating timing (7pm vs. 10pm), the overall experience may have been quite different.3.5/5 but rounded up on the hopes that my next visit, with a few different choices, bridges the gap.",3,0,0,Justin K.,"Manhattan, NY",148,20,61
5.0,9/10/2014,"Sad news, I just recently read that General Assembly, in Flatiron, would be closing after just a short six months of being open. Well, there are always some reasons why places close up shop so soon, but I will say, it certainly wasn't because of the food or service, which were both amazing. Since it won't be open too much longer, I'll save the details of the image and get straight to what I ate. First, you're served a skillet with an olive oil and salt brushed fresh bread. It's beyond delicious, warm, light and doughy and slightly crisp on the top from the oven. Next, as an appetizer, we had their Crudite and Dips: Smoked Tomato-White Bean, Housemade Ricotta-Local Honey-Chili Oil, Red Quinoa, Fava and Avocado (Served with seasonal vegetables and freshly grilled flatbread). These were a really great starter, and more than enough for a group of four to share. Each dip is different and dynamic. The Smoked Tomato-White Bean had a great flavor, almost like sun dried tomato, and texture, like a guac consistency. Which, is really what the Fava and Avocado reminded me of. The Ricotta was really interesting, maybe my least favorite of the group, it was thick and rich, but when paired with the flatbread (which actually tasted like matzoh to me), was a nice combination. I really liked the Red Quinoa, which really wasn't much of a dip, so much as a tapioca consistency. It was a little sweet, with golden raisins, and went really well with the flatbread as well. I also ordered a side of their Charred Broccoli. This was incredible, I could probably eat this everyday and not get tired of it. The florets of the broccoli are charred, but don't have any sort of burnt taste, just a lightness of crunch and crispness. They have peppers mixed in, and a sauce at the bottom that's savory and delicious. Then, for my entree, I ordered the Grilled Branzino (Summer Squashes, Eggplant). Another amazing dish. The fish was light and tender, and served in the perfectly generous portion. The vegetables complimented the dish very nicely, fresh, flavorful and delicious.",0,1,1,Katherine S.,"Manhattan, NY",160,257,919

The gnocchi and squid was good but not overly memorable. That said the steak frites were delicious but how often does one have a poor version of steak frites...I do not know many of them.I will say the service was very strong.

Anyhow, for appetizers we had:Gnocchi & Viking Scallops -- Fluffy and creamy gnocchi but it tasted bland. The miniature-sized scallops were just mediocre.Yellow Fin Tuna -- This was a-ok but they definitely skimped out on the tuna portions. Therefore, I would probably think twice about ordering this since its not worth the price tag.  Corn Crème Brulee -- Sounds amazing but tastes otherwise.For my main course, I ordered the New York Strip Steak Frites topped with roasted garlic butter. Once again, this was such a big letdown. I ordered my steak medium rare but it came out medium-well instead. Not only was it overcooked, it was under seasoned as well. It was missing all the essentials of a good steak. However, our waiter were generous enough to have it redone to my preference. As for dessert, we had the Apple Tatin Crème Brulee.

The gnocchi and scallops were a huge disappoint because the waiter promised equal parts gnocchi and scallops. There was literally 2 tiny slivers of scallop in mine. However, the gnocchi was the best gnocchi I've ever had. Definitely on the heavier side for an appetizer, but good. The Soft Shell Crab Louie with Green Goddess and Asparagus looked way better. The branzino was excellent. I would definitely recommend this entree. I also had a bit of a friend's New York Strip Steak, which was cooked excellently to rare and the portion was massive, so very worth it. We all ordered different ice creams for dessert. The espresso brownie was apparently a huge miss with everyone else, but my blueberry lemon chiffon was some of the best ice cream I've ever had. I just really wish it didn't come in a paper cup, felt very cheap, which really juxtaposed awkwardly with General Assembly. The decor was very high-class and the ambiance definitely matched.

4.0,8/8/2014,"Another Restaurant Week in NYC, another extraordinary restaurant pulling out all of the stops and showing an excellent sample of what they have to offer.My friends and I snagged a 7 p.m. reservation on a Wednesday, and were quickly seated at our table in a relatively opulent setting. Should you forget the name of where you're eating, the General Assembly insignia on their plates will surely rouse your memory. The Restaurant Week menu was extremely generous with options. I decided to not go totally heavy with portions and food richness and mix it up a bit. I ordered their Tomato & Watermelon Gazpacho with avocado, goat cheese, and strawberries to start. Upon being brought to my table, I was momentarily confused by the vegetable-filled yet soupless bowl placed in front of me. Soon, a waitress came over and poured the tomato base directly into my bowl. All of the flavors and textured complimented each other well. The favorite part of this dish was the avocado stick wrapped in baked phyllo dough. For my main course, I went for the New York Strip Steak Frites with Roasted Garlic Butter. The steak was a perfect and juicy medium rare, albeit a bit tough in some parts. The butter melted beautifully over the meat. The fries were perfect. For dessert, we had a choice of iced desserts or eclairs. I finished off my meal with a palate-cleansing apple-ginger sorbet served on a layer of fresh berries. It was so crisp and refreshing, though a little icier than I'm used to most sorbets being. My friends ordered many items from accross the menu, all of which they seemed to enjoy immensely. From the Landaff Cheddar Burger to the Housemade Ricotta with Local Honey-Chili Oil to the Espresso Brownie Dulce de Leche ice cream, everyone left satisfied, and we all got a chance to sample each other's meals. Backtracking, General Assembly serves absolutely amazing bread to whet their patron's appetites. Served in a black bowl, it's balled up, quite akin to Monkey Bread. Once pulled apart, the inside is velvety and deliciously yeasty, and a smear of butter and sprinkle of sea salt completes this amazing piece of carbohydrate heaven. The service was excellent, the food was top notch, and their bathroom was so cavernous and gorgeous. (It had to be said!)

We dine together quite frequently and this was the most spacious accommodation we've experienced so they got off to a great start immediately. We chose the Restaurant Week menu so I'll run you through that. Bread - Incredible. Incredibly delicious. Mouthwatering. Please give me more. They kept the bread coming and each time it was perfectly warm and buttery. I'd caution anyone going for the first time to not fill up on bread because it is incredibly easy to do here. No joke.Appetizer - I had the gnocchi with scallops topped with bacon. Nice portion size - not too small/big - and very flavorful. The bacon was perfectly crisped and added a real nice texture change to the dish.  Two of my other buddies got the soft shell crab and they were huge fans of it.Entree - I had the salmon which was cooked to my liking. The crust was crispy but it was very moist when I bit into it - not dry or tough. The cool yogurt sauce, warm potatoes, and cool cucumbers that accompanied it were ideal complements.The rest of my table got the steak and frites. They were all very satisfied with how the steak was cooked. Dessert - I had both the Almond Joy and Peanut Butter éclairs and all I can say is WOW! Mind you, I chose this over the ice cream because I assumed you'd only get one scoop. I was mistaken though because when my friend next to me got the ice cream it was at least 3 scoops and they put brownie on the top and bottom; surprise! He had the espresso.

Since I only got to the restaurant for the tail end of a birthday dinner, I'll obviously only review the drinks and the desserts that everyone shared family-style. The drink I got was actually passed onto me by the birthday girl, who opted for a honey melon drink with jalapeno and tequila. ...Not surprisingly, it tasted like ass. I'd lob this in with bloody marys in the ""Why the %$^&* do drinks like this exist"" pile. It was just spicy sweet water. Thankfully the desserts were much better. I'd say the standouts were the Espresso Brownie Dulce de Leche and coconut eclair. The ambiance is definitely on the fancier side-- it's quite spacious.

It sounded and looked better than it was. It wasn't bad, but I expected it to be earth shattering.The other was an array of spreads. This was the goodness. Every spread was tasty. The ricotta was my favorite.We got some sides. All were pretty good. The corn creme brulee was the best. It was creamy and bursting with flavor.The real winner was my entree. I got the lamb ribs.

Unfortunately everything else was downhill.  We were four of us, and there was not enough for us to order.  The service was absolutely shockingly horrible. First of all, the server we had, a young guy, was simply the worst. In a place like this you expect the servers to have gentlemen manners... I'm not sure if this guy was trying to hit on us or trying really hard to be funny or was just a weirdo.  His recommendations were also horrible. To add to the disaster, he served out friend her main course at the same time as all of our starters came out. To top it all off... even though we courteously paid him a 18% tip, he came back and asked if we had calculated wrong.

4.0,6/23/2014,"I really enjoyed my experience here. I'll try to comment on the food and drink in their order of appearance.As many have already noted, the complimentary bread was fantastic. Imagine a high-brow version of Olive Garden breadsticks where the flavor is condensed into a smaller, more delightful package. The cocktails were also quite good. Most of our party ordered the Loose Cannon - the spicy tequila option - and was not disappointed. The ice cubes were infused with jalapeno, which had the unique effect of making the drink spicier as they melted. I also tried the Take Five - a bourbon drink that, by its ingredients, looked to be a type of Old Fashioned. To my surprise, the drink was light and fruity; my reaction after the first sip was that it tasted like Pez candy.The appetizers were fantastic. The gnocchi was meaty, creamy, and luxurious. The beets - which I normally avoid - tasted more like lightly buttered potatoes, a very good thing in my opinion. The crudité was nice but unremarkable. I would not recommend the tartine unless you have a burning passion for sea urchin.For the main, I had the rabbit wellington. The portion looks small at first, but the dish is heavy and you will probably feel surprisingly full after the last bite. The atmosphere cost this review its fifth star. The bustle and uncomfortably crowded seating arrangement of the main dining room made me feel like I was eating at the Cheesecake Factory. Servers were constantly bumping into the back of my seat, and it was very difficult to hold a conversation over the din.Otherwise, this was a great place to eat, especially for the price point, and I'd recommend it to anyone who cares more for food than ambiance.",1,0,0,Julian B.,"Ann Arbor, MI",6,3,0

Description doesn't do it justice. Beets were nicely caramelized with some crispy looking chips made of some kind greens. Strawberries tomato gazpacho - there was goat cheese and creamy avocado and some other goodness. Soft Shell Crab Louie - nice lightly battered soft shell with a light green goddess dressing. Perfect summer dish. Get it while it's available since soft shell is only in season around now. Cavatelli & Meatballs - these had a nice spicy kick and there was eggplant. My bf ordered this and loved it. Cavatelli was perfectly cooked al dente. Corn creme brûlée - omg, yummmm! Be forewarned this is sweet like dessert but soooo delicious. Savor it with Arnold Collins cocktail (bf had 2 of these) or ginger carrot cooler (non alcoholic and if you're trying to get your carrot in for the day) and finish the dinner off with espresso brownie dulce de leche.

It was medium, but I know D was rushing to get home, so I didn't bother complaining. Not to mention my steak was overly salty.

This has a briny, vinegary taste to it (which I like) so if you're someone who enjoys things that are pickled, kim chi, vinegar etc., I would recommend this dish.

They were all decent, my favorites being the lame ribs and the sides, while the rabbit wellington tasted quite plain to me, and the steak being a decent cut but not being too flavorful. For dessert, we split several eclairs and ice cream scoops, which were all quite tasty and with unique flavors.The service throughout the evening was very good; the server did not want to bring the dessert wine I ordered because it smelled off and instead had me choose something else, which I appreciated.

5.0,5/8/2014,"My girlfriend and I try a new restaurant together every other week and we have both been wanting to try General Assembly since it opened. The restaurant and bar are gorgeous - grand scale, but separated by areas, rooms without feeling too large. The bar area was quite busy but we were still able to find seats at the bar and sit comfortably. I ordered a French martini (which for some reason, bartenders always have a hard time making) and I had to send it back to have it redone - however they were very nice about it and didn't seem to mind - they actually wanted to get it right for me - much appreciated.On to dinner...Our waiter, Kendal (a guy) was amazing - very sweet and helped us with our ordering. He seemed genuinely happy to be there and made us feel like we were his only table. Very attentive and kept checking on us, without being overzealous. We selected a bottle of the Brassfield 'Eruption' Red Blend - a mix of Malbec and Tempranillo (my favorites) -  it was wonderful. (A little too wonderful, I thought as I stumbled home drunk to my boyfriend)We ordered the Tartine with Sea Urchin, Robiolina and Tomato butter (which used to be called the Uni Toast) and it was splendid. Came with four pieces of toast, perfect for sharing. We also shared the Stracciatella which was divine and completely addicting. Next course was the Filet Mignon, a 9oz perfectly seared steak, with the perfect medium rare middle - delish. Was enough for us to share as well.Apparently Kendal felt that we waited a tad too long for our steak so he brought us two glasses of Prosecco, on the house. Oh Kendal, you doll.Martin, the manager, also came by to check on us and was absolutely charming and sincere. He later gave us a tour of the private rooms (we mentioned we often book them for our companies). He also sent over a ton of free desserts! We had the Coffee Praline and the Coconut Almond Joy éclairs (not my fave) and a chocolate molten cake/toffee pudding sort of concoction which was really amazing.Thanks to Martin and Kendal we had a fabulous night and will surely be back (we expect more free goodies...) ;)",4,0,0,Rebeka B.,"New York, NY",28,24,0

5.0,5/5/2014,"This is one of the best restaurants I have been to- both the food AND the service were superb. I go to new york every once in a while to visit a friend and ask her to choose a restaurant. This time she chose GA and Im so glad she did. I highly recommend anyone to go here, and it definitely isn't my last time. The restaurant is very big and we did have an issue with the kitchen getting backed up (saturday night)- however, the staff was very good about making sure that we were updated and they did follow up with us and made a few of our items on our bill on the house. We didn't have to ask them or complain, they willingly said that because our steaks had taken so long they were on the house and the dessert. I have to say you that you know you're at a good restaurant with good management when they offer you that without you having to say anything. THE COMPLIMENTARY BREADThe bread and butter was delicious. I can still taste it in my mouth. I had read a few reviews on here before going to GA saying that it was too salty, but I didn't find that to be the issue at all. We actually wanted more bread but we had ordered so much food that we really had to hold back when they asked us if we would like more.ISLAND CREEK OYSTERSIm not too educated on oysters, but I like them. The friend that I was with has had more experience with them so she chose these saying that they would be really good and they were! I recommend them!GNOCCHI AND VIKING VILLAGE SCALLOPSI love seafood and gnocchi so I knew I had to try this appetizer. I've had some pretty good gnocchi in my day but this was one of the best. It has bits of bacon on top also along with some jalepenos in it so it really gave it a kick. I would absolutely go back for this dish. STEAK FRITESSo this was the dish that took the longest because the kitchen was backed up. I asked for medium well, my friend asked for medium. Mine was medium well and I thought it was pretty good. But my friend asked for medium and her's was well done. If it wasn't on the house we would've asked them to take it back, but you can't really do that when they tell you its on the house so she kept it, had a few pieces and ate the sides we ordered. I enjoyed mine- as it was medium well.CORN CREME BRULEEif you like corn and creme brulee you have to get this! Its the best thing since sliced bread. I can still taste the deliciousness in my mouth. I really can't say much more than it was delicious and you have to get it!!BAKED BRIE POTATO GRATINAlso an excellent choice. My friend really likes baked potato and this was her selection- it was delicious.DESSERTSo i love dessert and always save room for some. When we asked our waiter for the dessert menu he said he already had some coming out for us. I'm guessing the kitchen was just that backed up and they just wanted to bring us something quick that wouldn't back up the kitchen even more. So we didn't choose these desserts but they were delicious nonetheless, satisfied my sweet tooth and it was nice that they put it on the house-- you can't complain when it's on the house.LEMON-BLUEBERRY CHIFFON ICE CREAMIm not a big fan of lemon so this wasn't my favorite but if you like anything and everything lemon you would enjoy this. Apparently, the waiter was telling us that all their ice cream is made in house- pretty impressive.ESPRESSO BROWNIE DULCE DE LECHE ICE CREAMThis was an espresso ice cream (again, made in house) with brownie bits in it and dulce de leche sauce drizzled on top. I liked this ice cream more than the lemon- but I also enjoy all these ingredients a lot more too.LAST DESSERT THAT I DON'T KNOW THE NAME OFI honestly don't know what the last one was since we didn't choose it but I will post a picture of it.. It was basically a chocolate cake with vanilla ice cream..thats my favorite kind of dessert and I really enjoyed this one. It comes with a side of chocolate syrup that you pour all over it. I would get this dessert again. LOOSE CANNONMy friend got this drink the loose cannon. The presentation was beautiful- one of the nicest looking drinks I've ever seen, but DRINK IT FAST! It is so spicy even when you first get it at the table but there are jalapeño ice cubes in it and when they melt the drink could be unbearably spicy!All in all I gave this place 5 stars because it really was great. Not only was the food good but the service also. Both the waiter, and manager came around and checked on us (the manager a little more than the waiter, but even the waiter said he wasn't having a good night).

I made a reservation here two weeks ago to bring my bosses (who are both from out of town and I love to bring them to new NYC restaurants) for dinner and we arrived at 7:10 for a 7:15 reservation and at 7:50 we still had not been seated. What's even worse is that had I not complained to the hostess I really don't think she would have been in any sort of rush to acknowledge our reservation. When she finally did come over she told us it'd be at least another 30 minutes until we were seated and offered to buy us a round of drinks, unfortunately there were people who don't drink in our group. All in all, it felt like that episode of Sex and the City where the new restaurant in town is trying to make a name for themselves and making people wait for no reason, and nothing pisses off a true new yorker more than making her wait for an average Caesar salad.

We ordered a bunch of the appetizers and sides, including the raclette service and the crudites assortment.  Pair that with a good selection of wines by the glass, and you have a great way to blow off steam after a day in the office.My one complaint is with the front of the house.  I was the first one to arrive since my colleagues had gotten caught up with last-minute items. The hostess told me she needed to check with the maitre-d' if I could be seated ahead of time and if I could wait at the bar.  So I waited for at least 15 minutes with no follow-up.  (Note: it was early evening on Monday, I had a reservation, and the place was half-empty).  The bartender was nice enough to invite me to sit while I waited for some more guests in my party to arrive.  When a couple more walked in, I got the same answer and informed them of that.  Luckily the other hostess was more responsive and was able to ""get permission"" to seat our incomplete party.  I can understand if it's prime time and the place is packed, but when it's a slower day and the clients can see all the vacant tables, do you really need to ask to make guests comfortable? Perhaps I would return for a drink at the bar or a meal with a smaller group.  Given how many choices there are in the area, I may go somewhere else before this if I have an important event.  You never get a second chance to make a first impression.",1,1,1,Valerie F.,"Jackson Heights, NY",261,154,0
5.0,4/3/2014,They just opened! What a beautiful restaurant with a pretty amazing menu. Dishes are bountiful in flavor but not too big.  The staff is really attentive and knows the menu well. I just at 5 courses and it was perfect.,1,0,0,Jamal M.,"Cambridge, MA",27,6,0
2.0,4/3/2014,"I went here last night for dinner with friends and was very disappointed. The bread was great (the best part of the meal) but everything else fell flat. Unless of course you want everything to be deep fried. I mean it, the artichokes were covered in a fried batter thicker than the choke. Even the snapper -  the only fish still available for order was deep fried and breaded. The minute we sat down, they told us of all the subtractions from the menu. Yep, that's right. Not additions or specials but items they no longer had available. It was Wednesday! I opted for a steak. My steak was totally overcooked. The huge mound of french fries were tasty, but I don't need to spend $25 for fries and a side of inedible steak. The saving grace was the dip sampler. My recommendation is to go for drinks and get the sampler. Then go up the street to Hillstones where they never mess up a meal!",0,0,0,Jennifer S.,"Manhattan, NY",0,13,1

5.0,3/29/2014,"We wanted to try out this new restaurant in the Flatiron district. They opened three weeks ago, but you'd never know if from the seamless service of the wait staff. The food is fresh seasonal and local ingredients with a twist. The apps are well thought out. We had the small Shellfish Assembly, which was a seafood tower of fresh seafood. The kumamoto oysters were amazing. The cilantro aioli was to die for. The mignonette was quite good too. We also had an uni toast that was delicious! The uni was fresh and very creamy. For the mains, she had the Rabbit Wellington, which was the star of the evening. The pastry was very light, flaky and the rabbit was very juicy, for only $26! I had the filet which was aged and properly cooked. For sides, we had the corn brule and polenta.The atmosphere was upscale but not pretentious. The staff was attentive but not invasive. Just seemed to know when we needed something. The wine list was quite affordable and very well paired to the food they served. Our server gave us good recommendations which went well with the food.All in all, a gem and a find. I'd recommend General Assembly without reservation.",6,0,0,Taro O.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,6,0
5.0,3/29/2014,"As of last night, General Assembly has become one of my new faves in Flatiron. From the founders of Quality Meats, GA rest just opened a few weeks ago (used to be The Hurricane Club, which I had never been to anyway), & by the looks of the good-looking crowd inside & the on-par staff, decor & food ensembles, one would have thought this establishment had been here for 10 years. I was craving a Hillstone burger last night but the wait @ Hillstone was 45 min so my friend & I moseyed up here as she had told me of General Assembly's new opening. I was skeptical at first to try a new rest since I had my heart set on Hillstone, but the hostess said she could seat us right away! Wait, what?! Immediate seating for two at 9:30 on a Friday night? Yes!  Fell.in.love. This restaurant is massive: high ceilings, plenty of floor and table space, not über crowded. The food being served all around us looked amazing. We started off with a few glasses of wine & munched on the house served focaccia-like rolls that came with butter & sea salt- bomb. I could have had 3 more just like it. After drooling on our neighbor's table, we decided to replicate their dining experience & ordered the Steak Frites ($29) & Corn Creme Bulee ($10). Omg. Both were amaze. I'm not a huge corn fan, but this corn side dish was unreal: almost could be a dessert. Sweet cooked corn under a caramel like glaze. The steak was well cooked & hearty. Our server - Bradford - was fantastic. He had worked prior @ Hurricane but knew the menu here like the back of his hand & made some great suggestions. Came to check on us often. While we were too full @ dinner's end to try desserts, they looked amazing & well priced @ $6.50/each.Cannot WAIT to come back here, perhaps for brunch. Loved the vibe in here (young professionals), the lighting, decor, the crowd. The decor & architecture sort of reminded me of Saxon & Parole meets Barbounia. Great new restaurant!!! Thanks for the amazing experience :)",9,2,4,Dorine C.,"New York, NY",242,141,216
4.0,3/26/2014,Went here on a Wednesday night and it was pretty crowded.  The bar was fairly busy and I had their house draft beer which was good.The bread at the table was very tasty and probably had a stick of butter in it but i was not complaining.  We started off with some Island Creek and Kumomoto oysters and the dip sampler platter.  Go for the oysters but not for the dips because the flatbread looks and tastes like matzo.  My main entree was the cavatelli with sausage. The dish was pretty good but not amazing.  The peppers and onions in the dish were odd sizes and it had a very acidic taste.  For dessert we shared the special of the day which was ice cream with a chocolate brownie.,0,0,0,Eric W.,"New York, NY",7,77,5
4.0,3/23/2014,"I had heard mixed reviews of General Assembly before eating there, but I was pleasantly surprised by our meal. The crudite and dip sampler was light fare but very good, and the duck confit was delicious. Dessert didn't disappoint either - I'd recommend trying out one (or more) of the eclairs on the menu. The restaurant itself is a huge space (it used to be the Hurricane Club) that apparently seats 170 people, but it didn't feel empty or unused. There's also a pretty cool giant chandelier that hangs over the main dining room. General Assembly is definitely worth a try.",5,0,0,John G.,"New York, NY",15,9,0
1.0,3/18/2014,"Seriously - just go somewhere else. From the point in time that I sat down to have a drink until I got up to leave I was completely dissatisfied with this place.  We waited for 20 minutes before someone came over to take our drink order. Let's start with the wine.  The cocktail waitress went ahead and poured me a glass of wine like I was having a brew at the Hofbrau haus. Granted it was ONLY $17 per glass, but nevertheless at least let me sample the wine before pouring it up to the top of the rim, assuming it would be perfectly fine.   Needless to say, the wine was corked.   Now let's get to the appetizer. One would think that ""roasted beets"" would indirectly imply that they would be warm when served.  Not so. In fact, the menu should re-written and should read, ""chilled best salad"".  That would have been more appropriate. On to dinner.  I decided to have the steak frites. My partner opted for the lamb steak.  The cut of beef I had was quite tender, but flavorless and fatty.  It was a cheap cut of meat, based on the amount of collagen that I had to chew through before actually being able to swallow (sorry for the graphic detail).  The lamb steak was largely inedible, and as my partner described it, ""gamey"", ""tough"" and ""dense"".  It took no time at all for us to decide on dessert.  We took a good look around at the nice decor, and will give this place 3 months at best.",0,0,0,Jonathan G.,"Manhattan, NY",3,35,0

5.0,3/15/2014,"Came for a double date last night, had been meaning to since this place opened. I wasn't disappointed.  I much prefer the new design (including the windows to the street) to the darker Hurricane Club that existed prior. The wine list was great, we were able to indulge in 3 delicious, reasonably priced bottles. We ordered oysters, uni toast, the gnocchi and scallops, the fluke and the yellowtail. Everything was great, but the uni toast was the star of the show and I'm not even an uni fan. I shared the sirloin with my wife for our entree and have to say that blue cheese creamed spinach and sirloin are a match made in heaven. Our friends got the rabbit Wellington and sea bass and were very satisfied. Please get the corn creme brûlée as a side, I had it first at another Stillman establishment Quality Italian and am happy to see it make the menu at GA.

2.0,3/13/2014,"It'll be impossible for this place to remain open in such a large space if they don't get it together quickly. First impression: the hostess was incredibly kind and caring. She made sure we were happy while waiting for our table by the bar and just went out of her way to be nice which we really appreciate. Give her a promotion! The cocktails were pretty good. We had their take on a spicy jalapeno margarita with jalapeno ice cubes which made the drink spicier as they melted. They were pretty good-not great. Bad server! When the first thing your waiter says is, ""do you guys know what you want?"" it's a sure sign of bad things to come. I kindly asked him if he was in a rush or if he could please explain the menu to us. He gave an explanation that took him all of eight seconds only telling us about the chicken and the corn appetizer. That was it. There was a manager walking around who didn't say a word to us and overall the service was kind of cold if not rude other than the wonderful hostess. The food was fine but nothing special. The decor is boring! You have such a grand space and that's the best you could do? My friends and I discussed over dinner how much rent must be for this huge corner restaurant. It's got to be a ridiculous amount. Point is, they won't last with food that's just okay, pretty good cocktails and bad service.

2.0,3/13/2014,"I always feel guilty writing a review of a newly opened restaurant-but then I think it through and wonder...why should a restaurant get away with being just okay its opening week? First impressions are HUGE. and should matter most. and its going to be foodies and critics who fill the tables of a hot new restaurant early on so lets make it count. General assembly didn't follow this mantra. Hurricane club was never a fave of mine. And a friend reminded me that often times if you don't like a restaurant, you wont like the next restaurant that occupies that space. I will commend the staff for being so attentive. The GM came up to our table multiple times to check in. I mentioned to her that I review restaurants so she offered to send a round of drinks out on her. VERY GOOD MOVE. Followed by a very bad move of the drinks taking so long that the apps came out before them. 1 word = mehhhhh. We got the crudite and dips sampler ( average at best), the racelette (way toooooo oily), the stratchiatella ( just okay), the grilled squid ( needs more squid), and the clams which it looks like they took of the menu. All of these apps were nothing memorable. The one memorable app was the uni toast. I love uni, i love toast. It was well done. My friends were bitching at this point, i was getting annoyed, and I had a friend at another table so I went to sit with her for a minute to see what she had to say. They were loving the cauliflower and the rabbit wellington. We didnt order rabbit we got the chicken and the salmon and spinach pasta.  The salmon sucked and the chicken was chicken and came out cold so they had to bring us another one. The spinach pasta was fine. Nothing to come back for. The side dishes all sounded amazing so in typical brooke fashion, we went balls to the wall and got the chickpea fries ( ew), the corn creme brulee ( yum) , the artichokes ( fry anything and it could be good), the baked potato anna ( a potato cut into 8 slices and broiled, eh) and the cauliflower ( too salty). After everything being just okay you would think we would pass on the dessert but no, we went for it. The mint chocolate macaron was really good and the sticky bread pudding was also pretty good. Dessert is hard to mess up. Overall, general assembly was just generally not goood.

All three were amazing.  For an entree, I had the roast chicken with a mustard sauce.  Not the most adventurous item on a menu that features rabbit wellington, but I was craving chicken that night.  It did not disappoint, achieving the perfect blend of moistness on the inside and crispiness on the outside.  The fries and a robust cabernet were nice to have on the side.  Although we were all either stuffed or pleasantly sated, I ordered an almond joy eclair for the table.  It was devoured in under a minute.  I don't normally take the time to write reviews online, but felt compelled given how great a spot this is.  I can't wait to go back.",0,0,0,Eric S.,"Manhattan, NY",0,1,0
5.0,3/11/2014,"Tried out this new restaurant over the weekend, and already can't wait to go back. The drink menu is unique--definitely check out the 'Loose Cannon' which is made with a jalapeno-infused ice cube, so that as the ice melts your drink gets spicier. (just be careful if you're brave enough to actually suck on the ice cube--it packs a punch) Also had an Old Fashioned, mixed perfectly, and the beer menu is pretty good as well.To start we got a platter of veggies with various spreads. My favorite was the smoked tomato, but the ricotta and quinoa were hits too. The steak was terrific as my main course, not surprising since this is the team that runs Quality Meats, but the sauce it came with, spinach and blue cheese, was absolutely killer. And we devoured the chick pea french fries in about 0.2 seconds. If you still have room for dessert, don't miss the brownie dulce de leche.

4.0,3/11/2014,"This restaurant seemed like uptown meets downtown, an interesting combination of innovative presentations and ambitious productions in a very pleasant setting. The space is large, but broken down into separate areas so we were able to talk (and hear).We started with the raclette, which was great fun - came with tiny potatoes, sliced meats, pickles and diced vegetables. The salami wasn't as tasty as I would have liked, but everything else was wonderful. It works well for two people sharing it.Moved on to the sea bass, which was nicely done - could have used a few more mushrooms. Sides we ordered were artichokes and fried chick peas. They were both good, but maybe too much alike to be needed at the same meal. .You start with tiny croissants and butter, which look cute in the pan. The wine we ordered by the glass was terrific. We ended with an apple on custard (that's not the name) that was delicious. Prices seem right.They have a large assortment of cocktails and seem to have the beginnings of a bar scene.

Bradford our waiter was extremely courteous. He did a good job helping us navigate the menu given our various dietary limitations. Our water glasses were promptly refilled, which is a must-have for me. He also did a great job presenting/explaining each course.FoodWe started with a selection of dips. The smoked tomato dip is out of this world good! We polished it off very quickly. The quinoa and ricotta dips were also very good. For appetizers, my wife got the arugula salad, and I had the grilled squid.The salad was all around delicious and fresh. The squid was at perfect doneness and perfect temperature. Little potatoes surrounding it were a nice touch.For mains, my wife got the beef steak frites, and I had the sea bass. We ordered the artichokes side and the corn creme brûlée. The steak was all around delicious. Fries were crispy and yummy. The sea bass in one word: Amazing. I had sea bass at Le Bernadin last month, and I think the GA one was better. Julienned snow peas had a lot of good flavor. The sides were also very good, though if I had to choose only one, I would skip the artichokes.For dessert, we ordered the chocolate cream pie eclair and the apple-ginger sorbet.

3.0,3/9/2014,"The restaurant is new so I'm confident in a few weeks they can turn most of this around but I wasn't impressed with my first experience here. When we arrived the entrance still smelled like paint, thankfully we were seated quickly. The new decor is ok not as impressive as the former space. It took 15 minutes for the waiter to take our drinker order and another 15 minutes for the drinks to arrive, we ordered the loose cannon which arrived in a half full glass and reassembled and tasted like a thick green cleansing juice, we had to send them back, out new drinks arrived 10 minutes later. Now time to order food, we got the ricotta dip (bland) and the Caesar salad good but didn't look the same as the one our neighbor table ordered, theirs had a ton of parmesan cheese on top ours had a minimal amount so not sure what it's supposed to be like. For entrees I got the chicken which was cold and tasteless when it arrived and my dining partner got the steak frites which was delicious we shared the artichoke side dish which was also good. Another issue is that the busers kept trying to steal our food and drinks before we were done eating. Literally the second we put a utensil down they would swoop in and have to wrestle the plate out of their hands, we lost 1/3 of our salad and some of our ricotta, also our lady piece of bread this way.

4.0,3/7/2014,"Generally, the food here was pretty good. Some items were not great, but the overall meal was very satisfying and definitely worth a return visit.The space is beautiful. It's a huge restaurant consisting of several large rooms with very high ceilings. It's a welcome change every now and then to have a nice, private table instead of sitting on top of each other like you do in so many of the popular smaller, more cramped restaurants in the city.They just opened a day or so earlier, so everybody was super friendly and welcoming. We were shown to our nice,  spacious table and proceeded to order a lot of food:- Complimentary breadThis was pretty tasty, but not as good as it looked. There were four little pieces that looked to be brushed with butter, with sea salt and rosemary on top. They were incredibly salty, which I happen to like, but would probably be too much for most people. It was missing some chewiness too that made it not seem quite so fresh.- Fava & Avocado Crudité ($11)They have four different crudités to choose from, which are $11 each, or $18 for a sampler. This ended up being one of the major misses of the night, as the supposed ""freshly grilled flatbread"" it included was incredibly stale and practically tasteless. It looked and tasted a little better than matzoh, which is a crime as anybody that has tasted matzoh would know. Make sure to skip these, as there are so many other starters to choose from instead.- GA Caesar Salad ($11)This was pretty good, and was just a fairly standard rendition of a Caesar salad.- General Assembly Fried Skate ($25)Like the rest of the stuff here, this dish was beautifully plated. There were two large, thin pieces of lightly battered skate arranged in a circle around some housemade pickles and tartar sauce. The skate was fried in panko bread crumbs, giving it a lighter, less overwhelming taste. It was very crispy, while the skate underneath was nice and soft. This is a great choice for an entree.- Our House Burger ($19)This is also a good choice, as you get a heaping pile of fries, which makes the $19 price tag for the pretty small burger hurt less since you save on buying the $8 side of fries. The burger itself is quite simple: a dry-aged blend of short rib on a classic sesame seed bun with some greens and some shredded cheddar, which I don't see too often on a burgers. It was quite juicy and had some great flavor to it. This is high on the list of delicious fancy pants burgers I've had recently.- Oven-roasted Cauliflower ($10)This was another slight disappointment. The cauliflower was pretty good, but it was a pretty tiny portion and after sitting for a bit, it became completely saturated in the heavy amount of oil it was cooked in, and became pretty overwhelming, in a bad way. Should've gone with my gut and tried the Corn Creme Brûlée instead of more silly vegetables.- Chocolate Peanut Butter Eclair ($6.50)This was as great as it sounds. The waitress brought over a tray displaying the 4 different choices of eclairs they offer for dessert. I wanted them all of course, but it was an easy choice when I heard her describe the peanut butter one, which was filled with chocolate. I don't frequently eat eclairs, but this one was excellent. It's hard, if not impossible, to go wrong with the chocolate and peanut butter combo.- Chocolate Cake ($6.50)This was even better than the eclair. It was a beautiful slice of cake, tall, dense and very rich. There were some crunchy cashews scattered on the plate and on top of the slice, which went very well with the chocolate. This would have to be my top choice over the eclair.The service throughout was great. It was so accommodating, it was almost to the point of being overbearing, but it was still very enjoyable.In summary, it sounds like I didn't like the vegetables but loved the fried fish, the burger and all the chocolatey stuff. In any case, if you are a child like me or not, the food here is quite good, and the overall experience is well worth it with the atmosphere and great service, which is mostly what elevated this for me from a 3 to 4 star review. It is pricey, so I probably wouldn't order so much if I returned, but I wouldn't mind coming back to try a steak or the Rabbit Wellington. And some more eclairs.",20,8,12,Mike C.,"Forest Hills, NY",5000,1694,69834
