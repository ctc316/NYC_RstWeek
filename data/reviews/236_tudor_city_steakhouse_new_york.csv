1.0,4/16/2019,"Wow, what happened? New management? Totally downhill.We'd been to dinner here in the past and the food was fantastic, and service professional. On our recent lunch, we were one of only two tables occupied. Water served, and ages later, menus brought by a different woman. What seemed like years after that, orders were taken by a new gentleman. A glass of wine ordered was never received. I looked around and didn't see any of the three employees anywhere. Months later, half of the appetizers were delivered. (Caesar salad dressing was admitted to be from a jar. In an expensive steakhouse?)  Years later, main courses. Steaks were served much rarer than ordered, so the texture was off. I couldn't eat mine but was sure if I sent it back I'd never see it again. Sides were wrong also, and some vegetables were cold. The food, we all agreed, was not good at all. Just a nightmare lunch, and everyone was an hour late back to the office.",1,0,0,Dennis O.,"Manhattan, NY",0,29,0

1.0,3/14/2019,Beyond disappointed! My friend and colleague booked this restaurant a number of weeks in advance and was promised a quiet room as the dinner was being attended by 40 guests and there would be speeches. The room was not quiet and we could not hear the speeches. The wait staff was rude and swore at a number of guests and to make matters worst we waited for an hour for entree of salad and the soft drinks and coffee and tea which was part of the package was never served.

1.0,2/23/2019,"Came here for winter restaurant week 2019 with reservation 7pm. My bf and I actually arrived early at 6:45pm and was quickly seated but we didn't leave till 9:30pm. Now it's not that we wanted to stay that long but it's the horrible service we received that ended this long. We waited 15-20 minutes just for someone to take our order, waited 30 minutes or longer just for each dish to be served. Now I would understand if something happened in the kitchen and everything is being delay but no one every apologize to the customers or explain the long wait. The manager was no where to be found expect staying by the bar talking to 1 person. You're doing your dam job alright. From the 2.5hours we were there I notice only 1 waiter is being rude and seem to be getting complaints from all over which is the one that is serving me. While waiting for my appetizer the waiter seemed to had an argument with a customer then he stopped a table of people from leaving accusing them for not leaving tips when the us tips, a customer next to our table was complaining for the long wait for food 30-45 mins of wait and instead of apologizing or explain the situation or even say he'll help him check he just walked off matter of fact got me a little worry a fight be start because the customer actually got up and walked to him. Oh not to mention if I'm correct only came by our table like 3x for the whole dinner. Now let's talk about the food. Our appetizers was great, my entree grilled veal porterhouse I asked for medium and thank god it was nice and tender and good but boy it was such a disappointment for my bf's sirloin. Now first we asked for grilled skirt steak but was told they're out so sirloin it is. But look at what that serve at a ""STEAKHOUSE"" 1/3 of the sirloin is fat, medium rare and the meat is rare on the big piece of bone. Desserts cheesecake and lava cake. I forgot because of the long wait time I couldn't had my bf ordered the lava cake but boy that long wait for the dessert was a disappointment as well. Cut open the lava cake but wheres the melting chocolate? It was a thick dried looking chocolate goo and we waited 30mins for this is a no no. Btw some of you might not know but if you pay with card they charge fees which is the first time I hear from a higher up restaurant. This is pathetic",0,0,0,Elsie H.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",1,65,89

2.0,2/13/2019,"Went during restaurant week with a group of friends, as it's our tradition and we like trying knew steakhouses. They messed up my order and then knowingly brought me the wrong cut of steak. They did not cook my friends steak to her desired level (gave her medium rare when she requested medium well). They advertised cocktail specials, but had none. They had a menu that had multiple issues (ie: wrote onion rings that didn't exist but was actually onion soup, they said the desserts has strawberries and were actually blueberries, etc.). Then, the bill came, with a very large and very illegal 'credit card fee' that had previously gone unadvertised, and then seemed annoyed when my friends and I paid in cash to avoid that fee.We will not be going back to Tudor City.  Save yourself the trouble and don't go, either.",2,0,0,Nicole A.,"Lynbrook, NY",8,6,0
1.0,2/11/2019,"Another victim of restaurant week, although this is what restaurant week is for. We tried, it sucked, we don't come back. On first glance, place looked charming and they were welcoming when we first walked in. It went down hill from there. There weren't enough seats at the table they had someone lead us to. The table seemed like it was going to be tight with 6 so one server went to ask if we could move, a second came by and did the same, finally a 3rd, very gruff server moved a chair and said we'd fit. The worst part is that the place was essentially empty. One of the main reasons we chose this place was for the variety on the RW menu. I got the beet salad app which was visually unappealing and bland. Thank goodness the walnuts were candied, it was the only punch of flavor. I ordered the sirloin which thankfully was one of the only entrees at my table that wasn't terrible. It came with average mashed potatoes and a tiny portion of surprisingly fresh broccoli. The steak was tasty but nothing to write home about. Compared to my dining companions' skirt steak though, I chose wisely. They couldn't chew their steaks and when they shared this with our server, Mr. Personality, he basically blew them off. As a customer, details are important to me. The bathroom was clean but the soap dispenser was broken in one of them, so they put a bottle in there and it didn't work either. The paper towels were like McDonald's napkins. Dessert was decent although the vanilla ice cream that comes with the lava cake was strawberry and no one who ordered it was informed. There just seemed to be a lack of courtesy and customer service. Very disappointing. I will say that the water guy was on top of his job, but he's the only one.",1,0,0,Ari S.,"Oakland Gardens, NY",1,57,22
1.0,2/11/2019,"went to tudor city for restaurant week.  we were a party of 6. we are  a group that dines out regularly; and, we like to try different places. the place was empty.  we asked if we could have a drink at the table at the happy hour prices only served at the bar.  we were told ""NO"".  so, we ordered a drink at the bar and asked to be seated.  they led us over to a table that was for a party of 5; not, 6.  they rearranged the table to seat 6.  again, this is an empty restaurant where we could have sat at any table meant for a party of 6.  next, we were only given the restaurant week menus (I guessed they sized us up as not being from around there).  we all ordered from that menu along with more glasses of wine.   the appetizers seemed fine.  three of us ordered the skirt steak.  it was awful.  so tough.  we left half of the steak there.  when the busboy asked if we wanted it wrapped, we answered, in unison, ""no, it was awful"".  the plates were taken away.  our waiter came over and asked how our meal was.  we told him how awful the steak was.  he said he'll let the kitchen know....maybe it was the cut of meat.  he placed the bill down on the table. there were no apologies.  no offers of an aperitif. no taking a percentage off the bill. nothing.  I don't know how this place stays in business.  I've never experienced this level of mediocre food in combination with poor customer service. do not waste your time or money on this establishment.",0,0,0,Patricia O.,"Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",0,2,0

3.0,1/28/2019,"Here's my first review of 2019........Went to Tudor City Steakhouse with two girlfriends for restaurant week.  The restaurant is kind of hidden - you will walk right by it unless you're looking for it.We were seated right away and our drink orders were promptly taken (we only had water since we were on lunch).  We asked to see both the restaurant week menu and their prixe fixed menu as the restaurant week menu didn't include dessert.We all ordered the same thing off the prixe fixed menu.....crab cake for appetizer, grilled steak for entree, cheesecake for dessert.  Our waiter had a little of a hard time getting our orders straight (why you may ask???  I have no idea).  The food itself was good - nothing overwhelming but nothing to run from either.  The chimichurri sauce that came with the steak could have used a little more seasoning but other than that everything was good.I don't know I wasn't overly impressed with Tudor City.  I mean it wasn't bad but it wasn't the best either.  I don't know something seems to be missing and I can't quite figure out what.  I would advise to go and see for yourself.",0,0,0,Kim O.,"Yonkers, NY",67,190,2
1.0,1/28/2019,"There are certain norms of a steakhouse that are expected when dining out. I know this place is new, but upon researching reviews/blogs and browsing the Restaurant Week menu we thought this would be a good time to try. WHAT A WASTE! To mimic other RW reviews--prompt seating, but ridiculous wait time. No servers were attentive. Cold and Stale bread. Credit card fee. ETC. ALSO, the RW week menu is diff to the one in house b/c every single dish only comes with broccoli and bland school lunch mashed potatoes .After 30 mins we finally ordered our oysters and tuna ceviche. Oysters thankfully are pretty hard to fuck-up, but also it's a cold app that do not take 30 min to shuck. The tuna ceviche was okay, expected more of a kick from the jalapeno. Next was the entrees. First they brought me the wrong dish and brought me a salmon instead of the prime NY ribeye Sirloin. They took back my bf's veal porterhouse at this time too, which meant just running it to the kitchen where they probably placed it under heating where his brocolli over cooked and the veal became tough (also was flavorless). When I finally got my steak, they did not bring our side of mushrooms or steak knives. Steak knives! We waited another 7 mins to eat bcuz of this terrible mishap. My steak was cooked to temp with a crispy outside so that's a star. The old fashions were also very good, so another star.Service was horrible. I watched a group of 6 total frat bros get seated after but dined way before us. The service seemed remarkable to anyone who did not have slightly darker pigmentation and like they did not live in the area. We were like chopped liver as one of the Turkish waiters spent his time smoozing between that table and another ""business table."" The younger male waiter was friendlier and you can tell he was holding most of the work burden, but still didn't do much to make our experience better. I'm so disappointed. I've done many steakhouses for RW over the years and never have I received horrible service like this. And in case you're curious EVERY table ordered from the RW menu.",4,1,0,Gavie V.,"New York, NY",144,78,123
1.0,1/27/2019,"Diners beware, make sure to double check your bill before you pay the total printed at the bottom. When I got my check, there was an additional $10 charge listed beside the line ""if pay by credit card,"" in addition to an automatic 20% tip (which wasn't a policy on their menu, website or check). I asked the waiter to clarify and he immediately became defensive and insisted it was NYS food tax, except there was already another line for tax under the subtotal. He repeated that it was tax twice more despite my pointing out the food tax line above. Given that he obviously didn't have an answer, I left it at that and opted to pay cash instead figuring it was a credit card related tax. On my way out the door, he stopped me and accused me of not paying the entire bill. I explained to him that the amount I gave him was calculated from an 18% tip based off the food subtotal, added to the subtotal and tax. He continued to insist that it was not the total on the bill as I continued to explain to him my math, going as far as to writing it down for him. Minutes later, as it became more obvious that he didn't understand my calculations or the random charges on the bill, combined with his accusations of cheating him of his tip, I asked to speak with the manager to which he answered ""I AM the manager."" Eventually he said he would go speak with someone else and less than two minutes later returns and dismisses me with a ""it's fine you can go."" However after all this frustration, I felt I was owed an explanation and an apology for his accusations and attitude, neither of which I received. I would have understood if he didn't know about all the components of the bill (although he should), but I did expect him to ask his supervisor to get me some clarity. Instead I was met with defensiveness and later on accusations of being a swindler. It wasn't exactly how I planned to end my Sunday family dinner. To top it all off, the service was very slow even though the restaurant was pretty empty when we ordered and the food was mediocre. By the way they DO offer free parking for dinner, contrary to what I was told over the phone the day before my reservation. If you've read this far, I normally don't post reviews on newer restaurants I feel blasé about but this waiter changed my mind.",0,0,0,A C.,"Manhattan, NY",0,42,554
1.0,1/26/2019,Came here for restaurant week and it was terrible. Reservation was for 730 and we got seated immediately which was great. Server took half an hour to take our orders so we didn't order til 8pm. Our FIRST course (appetizer) didn't come until 915 and our  2ND course (main) did not come until 945 close to 10pm. Most of my party (9 of us in total) got either the skirt steak or the veal. Only 1 of us got the Lobster risotto. 5 asked for medium rare and 2 asked for medium. ALL dishes were cooked WELL DONE! TERRIBLE. What makes things worse is they don't even know who ordered what. Gen they bring out the plates they're asking who got what so they also mixed who got medium and who got medium rare. So we complain to the server and he brings out who is probably the service manager and he says that they cook everything so that noone gets sick. But as a higher end restaurant you should know you don't need to OVERCOOK any type of meat. Lastly they only had 2 options for dessert where online it was showing 3. The waiter kept saying I'll make it up to you but did absolutely nothing extra for us. When we get the bill they decide to add an extra wine to our bill that noone ordered. Oh and a surcharge for paying with credit card? Lol what a joke. Never coming back and never recommending. Horrible experience.,1,0,0,Rickyy R.,"JAMAICA, NY",23,5,1

5.0,1/4/2019,"Happy New Year, Yelpers.   I'd like to start my Yelp reviews this year on a high note.  The past few months of 2018 were some of the toughest of my life and any chance I actually got to eat something out, it was pretty terrible.  I was starting to wonder what is happening to restaurants/take-outs these days.  And then I finally got a chance to go out at night for a New Year's dinner.  And it was this hidden gem, that used to be my favorite restaurant, Convivio,  that gave me the new year cheer-up I certainly needed.   I was expecting mediocre food at high prices, at best.  Instead I was pleasantly surprised -- shocked, really-- with delicious food, excellent friendly and fast service.The happy hour is a good deal -- excellent wine, a delicious cocktail called the Cape Cod for $7 and great filet mignon sliders!    As for the meal, the creamed spinach was the best I've had, as it was not too heavy like most are.  The veal was worth the $45.00 -- tender and full of flavor.  The pepper sauce, though very salty, was absolutely delicious.   The other sides were great.  And the star of the night for me -- the French onion soup was one of the best I've had, at a fair price.The only negative was the salmon-- it wasn't bad, wasn't fishy, it was just blah.  A lonely looking small piece of salmon on a huge plate.  I have a picture to add of the huge plate of veal next to the little salmon.   The white bread served could use improvement.But overall it was a surprisingly wonderful dining experience and I hope more people find out about this place.  It gave me hope for the new year!",5,3,7,Alexandra C.,"New York, NY",854,2017,62

5.0,12/11/2018,"Five stars for the most outstanding service I've experienced in years, maybe ever.  I'm a Tudor City resident and had been here only for drinks and bar bites.  I'd avoided dining, in part because I was disappointed that my hopes of a casual, neighborhood go-to place were dashed.  The menu is pricey and not normally within my budget, though I don't mind splurging for an exceptional experience, and the over-lit dining room didn't draw me in.  However, my sister and a friend were in town and we wanted something super-easy upon returning to my place after holiday lights bike-ride through Manhattan.  I was pleasantly surprised, though a few demerits.Small demerits for the following: no one offered to take our coats, and I was disappointed upon entering the dining room to see that the bad lighting design I'd observed from the outside was worse in reality.  Something about the blue-toned recessed ceiling lights reflecting on the high-gloss walls, together with the absence of table lighting detracted significantly from the ambiance.  That's where my criticism ends.Our somewhat elderly server, Ken, was a professional of the old-school type of service that feels refined but not stuffy.  Ken seems to have perfected the art of reading his customers, seeming to intuit precisely at what moments to approach and engage us and when to leave us to ourselves.  He ensured we felt warmly welcomed and acknowledged, but did not push us to order cocktails until just the right moment.  Drinks appear promptly, and the service was so unobtrusive as to feel as if things were teleported to our table.  When supplementing the menu with specials, explanations or variations, Ken exhibited a dry, sophisticated and understated humor, but without the haughty edge that characterizes many nice restaurants.  When I had nearly finished my wine, I noticed some sediment in my glass and asked to pour what remained into another.  Instead, a new glass of wine appeared seamlessly and without without effusion.  I could go on, but those sensitive to these sorts of observations will understand precisely what I mean and why I will return.  Ken was practicing a lost art -- sophisticated, professional service done precisely right.  The food was also superb.  My salmon was moist and delicious, even as it looked a bit sad and lonely on the plate.  And if I am paying $9-10 for a side of vegetables, I expect them to be done perfectly.  They were.  Broccoli and asparagus were each done to just-right tenderness, something not easy to achieve.  My sister's Fruits de Mer over pasta was gorgeous and she reported it was delicious.  The third member of our party had the filet, which he said was as tender as any he'd had, and cooked to his desired doneness (well), without any suggestion of dryness.  The cheesecake we shared for dessert was underwhelming but fine.  This was a very fine meal served by a professional.  If you are lucky enough to have Ken as your server, you'll forget that no one offered to take your coat and might even overlook the unflattering glare of the ceiling lights.  To my own surprise, I can now say with confidence, and after walking by for a year but ambivalent about trying TCS:  ""I'll be back.""",2,0,1,Jan T.,"Manhattan, NY",0,1,0

The food was fantastic. The place is very bright and clean. Nice atmosphere. Here we go for the down side. We ordered a bottle of Chardonnay. They did not have the one we wanted so we settled on  a bottle of Sauvignon Blanc. It was strike one. Then the waiter went to get an ice bucket and never put the wine in it. We asked a couple of questions and all they were concerned about was some computer issues that they were having. And how overwhelmed they are with upcoming UN events and meetings. Not my problem. We had to ask for more water when the second pitcher tasted like tonic water. We did not want to say anything at this point. We also asked what the side sauce was. When I asked what was in it I was looked at like I was painted purple. Still on the fence if we are going to come back. I could see if the place was busy but it was us and another table of two. We could not even pay. We had to wait because of there computer issues. Not cool !!!,1,0,0,Tony E.,"Bronx, NY",42,67,0
5.0,8/12/2018,"Our waiter alone is worth 5-stars. Even while underdressed and young-looking, we were served efficiently and politely. Of course, the extensive options on the prix fixe menu are also a plus. To start, we were recommended Bordeaux for red wine and riesling or sauvignon blanc for white. I went with the riesling because of the uncomfortable summer heat we just escaped. Our wine glasses were constantly refilled before they were even empty. We were also pleasantly surprised to learn thatThe Canadian bacon was too salty for my liking but the lobster risotto gets a thumbs up. The steak - which would've been the best option at a steakhouse, now that I think about it - was sooo good. I wish I could've traded my risotto back for a steak instead. Against my better judgment, I went for the risotto because I just had steak not long ago. Lesson learned: order the steak.

2.0,2/16/2018,"I was excited to try this place out, especially because we live so close to it and we wanted it to be a successful longterm business.  But considering the price, we were mostly disappointed.  Some pros and cons of this place:- The bread was embarrassing - a stale white bread.  A steak house should have a much higher quality bread.  It's the first thing a customer eats, so it was a disappointing start.- The Ambience needs a lot of work, we thought.  The sound design of the place was pretty bad - maybe some low music or something to help? And the design of the place could use some work.  They had battery powered plastic candles on the table.  If you're going to charge $50 for a steak, I think a real candle is in order.  - The staff was great though - very friendly and helpful.- The actual steaks actually tasted quite nice.  No complaints on the cuts or quality of the meat.",4,0,0,thomas r.,"Manhattan, NY",129,13,0

4.0,12/23/2017,"Best macaroni and cheese ever: crusty and delicious. It's a side dish ($10.95), so I also ordered asparagus ($11.95), because they must pay a fortune in rent. But the mac and cheese alone is almost a meal. Another time, I had broiled shrimp ($35.95), which were incredibly fresh. We shared a salad, and they split it onto two plates in the kitchen, which was nice of them. The owners seem to realize Tudor City is middle-class, and they have a handful of entrees under $30 (vegetable lasagna $22.95, hamburger $17.95).

3.0,11/14/2017,"Let me begin by saying I have great hopes and expectations for this restaurant. But, further thereto, let me also warn they are not yet met. This restaurant deserves to be five-starred; but not yet. It's an instant classic, with a venue that has been a restaurant since the beginning of Tudor City, but it needs tuning.The first few times I entered, I only had cocktails and bar food. But both were very good -the appetizers were, in fact, brilliant. The Old Fashioned cocktail was supposed to be made with Old Overholt rye, according to a sign, but it was not. And there was no muddling of sugar and cherry. Overall, though, still a decent cocktail. The bar is limited in size and is becoming busier every day. Often hard to find a seat.This is a steakhouse near where I live. And it is a welcome addition for its promise, since the other steakhouses in the neighborhood, notably The Palm, Sparks & Pietro's, do  not sell a porterhouse steak -which is, to my mind, the single best cut of steak available. Moreover the restaurant promises that it ages prime meat in its own aging locker. Finally, I note that this restaurant is apparently part of the same group that owns Four Cuts, on First Avenue, where I have previously had dinner -and a great porterhouse. So this promises to 'one up' Four Cuts, and that sounded good. I should note, they also serve a lot of seafood and even have ceviche. But as with all new ventures, there are still hitches in the road. Most importantly, the steak was imperfect and does not compare, yet, with the Four Cuts I had, and certainly not with Keens or Peter Lugers. It's good, and was served medium rare, as I asked, but was a little tougher than I expected and the flavor was not outstanding (but it was, in fact, very good). The sides were a mixed bag. Home fried potatoes were served too cool with some of it dried out and hard-chewy. Asparagus and the truffled-cream corn were both excellent. I highly recommend the latter. Given some time, I expect to rank this restaurant much higher. For now, however, I am somewhat disappointed.",5,0,1,Steve O.,"New York, NY",7,87,4

1.0,10/14/2017,"Something has gone terribly wrong with the decor and mood of this new place.  We were excited to finally have a neighborhood spot, but the decor is bland, uninviting and terribly over-lighted.  The lights on the back of the bar strip it of any sense of relaxation, and the same can be said of the dining room.  The food was good on the whole, but in the absence of any warmth and intimacy from the decor and lighting, the entire meal felt awkward and uncomfortable, largely from overhead light sources, which are a friend to no diner. For that reason alone, we won't be back.  Would also have liked a nice, cozy place for after work drinks, but felt at the bar like an interrogation was about to begin! The  interior designer must have been AWOL at critical decision stages!  Something is just terribly ""off"".  As said, the food was good, but not great, so didn't justify the steep bill.  The location had so much potential, so it's especially disappointing after our high hopes and eager anticipation.",0,0,0,Barbara R.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,1,0

5.0,10/12/2017,"This is a new addition to the Tudor City neighborhood and is a great place for dining or just to have drinks and appetizers at the bar. They have a great happy hour and bar bites that are delicious. My friend and I had a few glasses of chardonnay and ordered the filet mignon sliders and a side of truffle fries. Food was really tasty and the fries are to die for! (Wish they would add prosecco to the happy hour drink menu!). Lavon the bartender was the quintessential bartender - attentive, but not obtrusive. Friendly and professional too. Tudor City Steakhouse is located across from Tudor City Parks which is a beautiful setting. I think (but don't quote me) they are also going to have outdoor seating which would be fabulous. I think this location is ideal for people who work at Pfizer and the United Stations - the restaurant seems like the perfect ambiance to host business lunches and dinners.",0,0,0,Jill M.,"New York, NY",13,166,1

Many of the residents, including me,  prefer it this way. But we desperately needed a replacement after losing L'Impero/Convivio.  I went with a friend and had a very meal. The rib eye steak was prepared the way I like and was large enough for 2.  My friend was very pleased with the burger on the menu. The sides were a little uninspired and could have used some creativity.  They're just starting so adjustments are expected.

3.0,9/26/2017,"This was a tough one, I've been looking forward to this restaurant for months. A small group went for happy hour at the bar. We ordered drinks and a few bar bites and appetizers. The calamari was great and a nice portion for a happy hour special. The wine and beer specials were also great! We also ordered a few different types of ceviche. My ceviche was not the one I ordered, but enjoyed it none the less as they all looked good and staff appeared occupied. At the end of our meal we asked for the bill to be split a certain way and it came back divided incorrectly. We entertained ourselves watching the bartender make drinks, which was unfortunate because we also saw the drinks go to tables incorrectly. Hoping this is due to the new opening and we will go back and have an improved experience to review! Maybe with more time the service will change to match the delicious food.",1,2,1,Miranda D.,"Manhattan, NY",65,15,9
3.0,9/26/2017,"Went there for lunch today. Let me start with the positive aspects: the service is great. The waiters are attentive and very friendly.  On the flip side, the steak I had was not on par with what is on offer in the other premium steakhouses in the city. I ordered the sirloin, and while it was perfectly cooked, the quality of the meat itself just didn't have that dry-aged, prime ""edge."" Another thing, it came sliced.  In my opinion, never bring a steak to a customer sliced unless you tell him/her first and give them a choice. The side of  onion rings was perfect, though. Avoid the truffle butter as a sauce; it is barely edible.  Another issue I had was the fact that the AC was not on even though today was quite warm, so I wasn't exactly comfortable while dining.",0,0,0,Ahmed S.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",43,6,0

1.0,9/22/2017,"I was truly excited about having a new neighborhood eatery on my block...until I looked inside. The first thing I saw was a child sitting at the bar. What is this, Applebees? I decided not to go into the pretty empty establishment (a Friday night at 7:15) and spotted the menu complete with ceviche and sushi, constant ""ladies night"" (hello, it's 2017), not one but 2 happy hours, etc. I decided not to ever go in because the people who put this business plan together are not too smart. I will never go in and will share with all of my neighbors my first extraordinary non-experience. I am completely disappointed, having resided in Tudor City for 20 years and truly expecting something well thought out. The last time I was in the location of the new restaurant, Valentino, the designer, and his retinue came in and were completely bowled over by the atmosphere and the service and incidentally invited by partner and I to join them. If I saw him now and he wanted to return to the same place, I'd tell him to go to TGIFridays or Olive Garden.",0,0,0,Mark H.,"Manhattan, NY",40,10,0
