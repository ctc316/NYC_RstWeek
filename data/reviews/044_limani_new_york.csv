4.0,4/28/2019,"So I was initially excited then very nervous after reading very mixed reviews, but was pleasant surprised upon arrival. The decor was super clean and refreshing and very well lit. Given a few reviews we were nervous regarding possible racist behavior, but gladly was not confronted with said uncomfortable behavior. The hostess was pleasant and seated us immediately.Our waiter Malik was super attentive, but respectful enough to give space while me and my dinner mate got caught up; he was also very observant to note because I didn't want salt on my margarita that I might have dietary concerns for our/my food and made inquiries.The cocktails a key lime margarita and my friends Greek beer we're refreshing. And all the food all around was super delish. Quite pricey the overall menu but thankfully they have decent lunch/dinner prix-fixe menus and decent windows of service for said menus.Items had:Octopus Tunisia; Grilled sashimi quality octopusMushrooms A Freshly picked selection of organic mushrooms grilled with olive oil, lemon, sea saltGrilled Vegetable Medley Seasonal vegetables with grilled halloumi cheeseLamb Chops Colorado. Grilled American Lamb ChopsBaklava Almonds, walnuts, cinnamon, layers of phyllo baked with honey syrupKaridopita Walnut sponge cake, cinnamon, cloves, honey syrup served with vanilla ice creamMy overall initial experience was great and I plan returning, but will have to strategically plan visits due to the pricey menu, which per someone else's review is that of a Steakhouse.",0,0,0,S S.,"Bronx, NY",127,239,1804
2.0,4/26/2019,"Poor service and extremely mediocre quality for what you're paying. You're better off traveling to Astoria (or Greece if you have money to blow on Limani) for some good, authentic and most importantly, FRESH seafood. Expect all the mains to cost you $40+ when all that's done to them is a little salt and pepper before they're grilled. Appetizers and salads cost about $20+ each with the same minimal effort of preparation. Left the restaurant wondering why I spent money here when I could've done the same, but better, at home.",1,0,0,Katherine H.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",3,10,4

3.0,4/13/2019,"We were looking for some good Greek food in Manhattan, which is hard to come by considering Astoria (nearby in Queens) truly has the best Greek cuisine. We decided to check this place out since it was conveniently located in Midtown. Service was great and the interior was beautiful, but if I had to sum up this place in one sentence, it'd be this: very average food for extremely exorbitant prices. The food definitely didn't taste bad at all, but our meal was also nothing special. We just felt that our money would've been much better spent elsewhere where we would also get better-tasting, more authentic Greek food.",1,0,1,Jung Y.,"New York, NY",392,35,178

1.0,3/31/2019,"bland food, very expensive, small portions, decent ambiance. basically, if you like the idea of going out to dinner, but don't actually care about the dinner part, this is a fine option. even the complimentary bread + olive oil was uninspiring. their ktipiti looked like it had been squeezed out of a tube or something, not a super fresh aesthetic. the fish is fine but pretty minimal, any sides will need to be ordered on top of everything else. also, egregious!: they only do this bizarre deconstructed baklava if you don't order off the prix fixe menu, and let me assure you it's not the same. but someone in my party did order pf so i got to taste their regular baklava. yup, also no good.",1,1,1,The G.,"New York, NY",2,30,0

3.0,2/28/2019,"I went to Limani for lunch and I was disappointed with the service and food. - we were seated promptly but the tables where so close together that I had a hard time to get in despite me being only 150 pounds with medium frame (maximize revenue)- we went with lunch special which was inflated as in the past it was around $29 and now $37- the appetizers were rushed in and average in quality (went for Mediterranean mazze)- got the Mediterranean bass/loup de mar for main which came in very quickly after removing appetizer . The fish was a bit dry, tasteless and I felt it was made 20-30 mins ago and kept under a warm lamp as the plate was very warm. I suspect they make it bulk before lunch hour so they can turn around the table quickly- the walnut cake was dry I think Milos is better for the same kind of food and I would not recommend Limani!",0,0,0,S S.,"New York, NY",34,39,12

Used to be 4 big pieces and now it's 3 tiny babies 2. The halibut was dry AF. Significantly overcooked.3. Rude waiter (older gentleman with glasses). When we told him the fish was bad at the end of the meal, he said ""well, you should have told me sooner."" And then did nothing to remedy the situation. Not even an apology or a piece of baklava. The funny part is we didn't see him between ordering the fish and paying the bill, so there was no way to tell him.

1.0,2/20/2019,"I made a yelp account just to write this review and that should speak volumes about this place. My friends made a reservation for Valentine's Day for a group of 4. We had to cancel and my friend had called to speak to a manager to see what our options were as we did consider rescheduling for another day. The cancellation policy would've charged us $420 for not coming and of course no one wants to pay that. The hostess put my friend on hold several times as she tried to get a hold of a manager and every time she'd get back on the line she'd apologize and reiterate the cancellation policy multiple times because this 'manager' would not come to the phone. Understood, a policy is a policy and we were not fighting them on it. But we called to speak to higher authority, not a hostess-no offense. Eventually a manager did come to the phone and I have never in my life heard a manager speak the way this gentleman did. He was outright rude and basically DEMANDING that we pay the fee and that nothing can be done. He didn't even let my friend get a few words in. His tone was atrocious and demeaning as we have never experienced this type of customer service. Maybe he was stressed out because it was a busy night but seriously? Not even let us speak? It was like we were being scolded for having to cancel our reservation. How do you become a manager in the restaurant business when you seem as though you have no amicable traits? It's a shame such a beautiful place like this has to be shitty because of the wrong people. We did get his name however so people reading this, please call beforehand and make sure Patrit is not working that day/night so you yourself do not have to deal with this type of person. I hope one day my friends and I change our minds about this place but as of right now, we will take a detour. Maybe when we come back, this place will be under better management.",0,0,0,Vick H.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,1,0
1.0,2/19/2019,"I had came here a few months ago for a dinner meeting with a drug rep company and enjoyed everything about the restaurant, but after my recent Valentine's day experience last week, I will say I will never step foot in this place due to poor management and for a having a very dismissive staff. I called to cancel my reservations a few hours before my scheduled time due to an urgent emergency where I had to goto urgent care (which I have documentation), and when I spoke to a male manager he was very nasty and very dismissive and hung up the phone on me. I was told I would be charged a cancellation fee of 105$ per person, because I did not cancel within 48hrs. How is someone supposed to do that if the reservation was made the evening prior??? Also after booking the reservation it did not clarify the cancellation fee. Now the next day comes and got an email stating I did not show up, which is false because I called to cancel. I called the restaurant and open table to dispute the charge and nothing was resolved, all I got was an email stating the cancellation fee is their policy, I responded to the email for someone to call back to further discuss this matter, and no response. I also called the restaurant to speak to a billing manager and was told she wouldn't be back in until Monday,  and this call was on Friday. I understand businesses have regulations but no one can control last minute unfortunate circumstances and felt these people only care about money, not their customers and customer satisfaction services. I will be reporting this matter to Better Business Bureau, because of the inconsistency and lack of communication for someone to resolve this matter. No one has 210$ to throw away.",1,0,0,Sara B.,"Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",0,2,0
3.0,2/16/2019,"Would be a 3.5 star review (Yelp...we don't live in a integar world - can't be giving out amateur scores (one bite...everyone knows the rules)). My brother and fam (2 nieces) were coming into the Rockefeller area from Philly, and met them at Limani for a Saturday lunch. Fairly upscale atmosphere, but not pretentious and pretty accommodating for our somewhat fidgety 5 and 1 year olds in tow.  We pretty much stuck to the lunch prix fix menu ($37 for app, entree, dessert).  We pretty much ordered to share everything (3 orders, the kiddies were sharing). And we got:Apps:Mediterranean Mezze - Taramosalata, Tzatziki, Hummus, Ktipiti, Tiropita, Dolmades - with ample table bread and pita, this was quite the crowd pleaser! I particularly enjoyed the ktipiti and taramosalata (Grilled Octopus - Tunisian, sashimi quality octopus ($8 supplement) - the other reviews are correct, this is absolute wellllllll worth the supplement. Lightly charred but not chewy, this was delightful. And they didn't skimp on the amount of octopus either - plenty to go around (and thankfully so, wouldn't to throw some 'bows at the table for the last pieces).Avocado Salad - Served with baby shrimp and drizzled with olive oil - a bit underwhelming, honestly - a half scooped avocado, filled with guac (otherwise all normal avocado) with 3 shrimp on top. At the end of the days, it's still [delicious] avocado...but I could eat one at home.Mains:With the kiddies with us, we played it somewhere safe with two orders of the lamb chops - Grilled and served with Greek fries and seasonal vegetables ($8 supplement), as well as an order of the Loup de Mer, Moist and mild Mediterranean Sea Bass served with steamed vegetables.Lamb chops - we ordered these both medium, but one came out a bit on the rarer side (not that I particularly cared all that much...but there was a notable difference between the two orders, and consistency/order accuracy should matter).  Two chops for per - and the chop that I pulled was more than half fat. The two bites of meat I had were tasty, though. Steamed veggies (broccoli and cauliflower) and the fries were fine.Sea Bass - I wish we ordered two of these. Perfectly tender, no frills, whole fish, with a little bit of olive oil. Delicious.Dessert: We ordered:Karidopita - walnut cake with ice cream - loved the walnut infusion, but a bit on the sweet side, ice cream ironically helped to cut it; thankfully we got some fresh fruit as well. I mentioned it was my (and my brother's) bday, so they graciously gave us another order on the house. Yiaourti - greek yogurt with thyme honey (and pecans atop) - I think this was the winner. Firm, quasi-tart yogurt, with some sweet, savory honey and pecans for added texture...very nice. Fresh fruit - standard assortment, refreshing.A very nice outing overall, very accommodating staff, though with a couple of miscues, but would still like to come back for a dinner...and especially for that octopus.",2,2,2,Steve L.,"New York, NY",157,309,1204
5.0,2/14/2019,Went for the first time and had a great Valentines day dinner. We were greeted warmly by 2 ladies at the entrance and I was given a red rose as they walked us to the table.

5.0,2/8/2019,"When was the last time you had a fantastic meal in a breathtaking atmosphere and with excellent, nearly personalized service? For my friend and I, it was this evening.I remember passing by Limani a couple months ago and standing outside, in awe of their pristine white, elegant decor.When my friend suggested Limani for our dinner plans tonight, it was a suggestion based on their $49 three course pre-fixe dinner menu which is offered in addition to their full menu (restaurant week menu also available this evening since it was the last day; therefore, three menus to choose from).We had early reservations (since the pre-fixe dinner runs until 6:30) and arrived by 6 p.m. At that time, the restaurant was fairly empty but I was struck by the beauty of the decor and took the opportunity to snap a couple photos. Limani is Greek Mediterranean with emphasis on seafood (and a selection of fresh fish on ice in full view).The service was over the top. We had about 3 different staff members checking in with us for the duration of our meal. My friend thought it was a bit too much.We already decided to go with the pre-fixe dinner menu. I would have chosen the restaurant week menu at $42, but octopus was not part of the first course selection. BTW, the waiter informed us that portion size for both menus were equal. Each course was quite generous. Here is what we ordered as we nibbled on fresh, crusty bread served with delicious Greek olive oil:1st course--we both ordered the octopus.This was absolutely amazing. Thin slices of octopus prepared with julienned onions and bell peppers in a lemony, olive oil dressing and garnished with capers. A huge home run.2nd course:My friend chose salmon and felt it was a bit undercooked. It seemed fine to me but she typically likes her meat and seafood well done.I selected the Dorado fish which was an entire sea bream deboned and prepared simply but very flavorful with lemon, olive oil and capers. It was served with a broccoli floret. I was overwhelmed by the portion size and very much satisfied with my selection. Recommend!3rd course:My friend selected the baklava cake (note: she failed to see that there was a supplemental $5 charge for Baklava). The explanation that it was homemade didn't seem logical for the additional charge, but c'est la vie. My friend enjoyed it but said she tasted better.I chose the walnut cake served with a dollop of honey-lavender ice cream. This was delicious without being overly sweet.We ordered a glass of wine to accompany our meal (at $15 per glass) and I am still very full as I write this review.I think I enjoyed the meal and experience more than my friend although she was satisfied enough.I honestly could not find any missteps with my first time experience at Limani.And even though we chose the pre-fixe menu, we each paid $95 for our meal. It's definitely not considered inexpensive.In my opinion, I experienced a terrific meal, great service and stunning atmosphere. So well worth it especially in the heart of Rockefeller Center. Highly recommend especially if you love seafood.To Limani---very well done.",31,16,32,Johanna B.,"Brooklyn, NY",468,560,1574
3.0,2/7/2019,"Went with my husband midweek for restaurant week. The décor in the restaurant is really nice and we got a table right next to the water fixture they have. We both opted for Calamari as our first course, which was a safe choice and met our expectations.

5.0,2/2/2019,"Ordered from the dinner prix fixe menu. For the appetizer got the grilled octopus. This was the best part of the meal for me. The char from the grill was just the right amount - added flavor but not a burnt taste. Loved it! For the main got the salmon; the salmon ordered medium and was perfectly cooked. Karidopita was my dessert; the walnut cake itself was pretty bland - would have enjoyed more butter. The ice cream was honey lavender and quite light and tasty. Regarding service: our meal did not feel rushed; they paced the various parts quite nicely. It did take some 40 mins to pay our bill. Mostly a result of trying to use an Amex gift card for a portion, but they eventually sorted it out.

4.0,2/2/2019,"Limani is a Greek/Mediterranean style restaurant in Rockefeller center. Like many other Greek restaurants they feature a small fresh fish market where diners can choose their own items and have it prepared.I came here for restaurant week for what was supposed to be a girls night out. The restaurant was very accommodating, I moved the reservation, we were late and not as many people as the original reservation showed but the hostesses were kind. AND then they were gracious enough to seat us near the small pool. The restaurant is beautiful and has a noisy silence to it, which is perfect for catching up and chit chatting. We did order off the restaurant menu but let me tell you those grilled scallops as an appetizer I would come back here for that alone! The salmon was delicious perfectly salty and charred. My date loved her lamb chops but did say there was a little too much fat on it. The calamari was standard as was the salad and the cake I feel Milos does a better version of it.The experience was an extremely pleasant one and they did not rush us out of the restaurant (we were the last couple)With our food and drinks it came out to about $80 per person which was right in my budget for the night. will be back in the summer when I do my annual top of the rock visit.",3,0,1,Raye S.,"Brooklyn, NY",333,115,102
4.0,1/30/2019,"It had been a minute since I attended an educational dinner - I enjoy them but hey, life is busy. However, the stars finally aligned this past week and I happened to be in the right place at the right time - so of course I pounced to secure an RSVP. This is how I found myself at Limani. Judging by their Yelp page, this looked like a total score so I was looking forward to seeing what they had to offer.Sitting in pretty much in the heart of Rockefeller Center, Limani has the feel of a Midtown restaurant. I don't mean that in a bad way though - the aesthetics are cool and modern with low lighting offset by a subtle blue glow. The color scheme is mostly white, with the modern touches continuing in the furniture, bar on the back wall, and impressive fountain-pool in the center of the dining room that serves as a focal point. One of my Yelp friends described it as ""Miami meets Midtown"" which I feel is the perfect phrase to summarize the aesthetics - I was a fan. We were seated downstairs in a private room; our menu was fixed with the exception of our choice of entree. They started by serving a variety of apps: fried calamari, an assortment of Mediterranean dips with pita, eggplant chips, tomato-cucumber salad, mushrooms, and roasted peppers (I think that was everything). As a whole, the apps were tasty - the dips were really good, and I was impressed they used rings and tentacles on the calamari. I was also happy to see eggplant chips, though it covered an additional dip which didn't make much sense mechanically. The salad added a welcome freshness and was tasty in its own right. For my main I had salmon - I thought it had good flavor but wasn't too outstanding (here's where the restaurant week treatment kicked in). However, the warm potato salad that was served on the side was a great complement. For dessert, we were served fruit with Greek yogurt, plus baklava and walnut cake. These were all quite good - flaky, sweet, and a great finisher to the meal.Service was great - everything was served at a pretty good pace and we never felt forgotten. Overall, I was really impressed at Limani's offerings for an educational dinner. While I have no immediate plans to return, I'll definitely keep it in mind when looking for places to eat in Midtown.",12,3,6,Jason M.,"Bronx, NY",474,719,3173

I wouldn't say they were out of this world amazing, but decent for the price point. As for my main, I got the Loup de Mer, which was extremely tender and cooked very well. I love sea bass, so this dish was right up my alley. The fish was definitely very moist as well. As for dessert, we were both trying to watch what we ate, so we just had the seasonal fruit.

The next time I go back I will get the fish instead of the shrimp entrée. The risotto was delicious but the shrimp was overcooked. The dessert was awesome. I had the cake with ice cream. The cake was super moist with a little bit a honey at the bottom of the cake. I was hoping it was vanilla ice cream but it was sort of this minty ice cream that I didn't care for personally.

2.0,12/17/2018,"Was at dinner at Limani Saturday night with two friends from out of town.  I am a regular there and I dine at Limani at least twice a month since I live just a block away.  Used to a Milos fan but since two years ago switched over to Limani for hosting business lunch and dinner with friends.  The hostesses were nice and pleasant and both recognized me right away and said welcome back.  However, the bread boy showed no empathy.  The person who came to take our orders was worse.  We were there at 7.15 p.m., when one of my guests tried to order the Prix Fix menu, she was greeted with a blunt ""no .. we don't serve PF.""  I told him I was a regular and that I often order the PF myself.  He then said, then you should know better.  We don't serve PF after 7 p.m.  That response was blunt. Don't think he appreciated that I was a regular at the restaurant.  He was not too helpful with the menu or wine choice either.  Two of us ordered crab cakes and both of us ended up with upset stomach and loose stools. The other two ordered fish .. halibut and salmon.  The presentation and how fish was prepared was subpar.   I have had better experience at Limani than this time.  I am switching back to Milos.  NOT GOOD!!!",0,0,0,Lisa P.,"Rancho Santa Fe, CA",0,15,0

While deciding what we wanted and letting our waiter know what our choices were, we had asked his opinion on which one of the two apps were best, we chose one, but somehow ended up getting both. We didn't say anything because he had already split and served it to us on our plates (btw they don't change out plates for you after you've had a few things on them).

When you enter, the dining space is open and clean with a upbeat hostess and attentive servers. They try to make it an experience for you; our server asked us if we wanted to take a look at the selection of fish to help us choose.For starters we ordered a whole array of dishes including fried soft shell crab, oysters, octopus, various dips w/ pita. The dips and octopus dish were delicious, however, I found the fried crap and fish to be subpar (especially for the price you're paying). Also the oysters were ridiculously overpriced. Our table ordered the whole sea bass (ended up being $300) which was immaculately prepared, seasoned perfectly and extremely delicate. This was the best part of the meal. I would give this place a 3 stars for two main reasons. While the main fish was delicious, the other dishes were honestly subpar especially at the price you're paying.

I was like...what? How awesome is that?  Stuffed calamari was excellent. Lobster was very good, although a portion of it had this taste that felt like you just pulled out of the Hudson River. Mussels were very good as well. I didn't try much more than that, but the service and food were very good.    The restaurant is gorgeous.

5.0,9/9/2018,"This is by far the best Mediterranean/Greek food I've ever had, and this is coming from someone who's previously hated eating this cuisine of food, because like Indian food, if it's not home cook, it's just not the same. Went with a group of colleagues and were promptly seated. The head chef guided us to the fresh catch area to select our fish for the sashimi, as well as our picks of langoustines and a whole lobster. Thinking about the appetizers is what helps me fall asleep at night. The phyllo wrapped feta drizzled in honey was the most incredible thing. So was the Greek salad, selection of hummus spreads, and the octopus--best I've ever had. Haven't found grilled octopus that compares yet. Sashimi and langoustines were also incredibly fresh. The portions were also huge enough to share amongst a table of 8.I had the swordfish steak which was solid, but the lobster was so well cooked considering its size. The head chef recommended a fantastic Greek white wine that was so good, it made me reconsider my obsession with Italian or French varieties. With the sheer amount of food around the table, the chef gave us complimentary desserts which was so gracious. I can't say enough nice things about this place and I'm itching to go back.

Like others say there is some sort of infinity pool type thing in the center. Dim purplish lighting. Got seated close to the kitchen. Was on business in NYC. Had some dinner with my project lead. I got the tomato salad starter. Probably should have gotten the roast vegetables in retrospect because it had some kind of foam on it that seemed interesting. The tomato salad left something to be desired. Had the salmon as an entree. Well cooked. Skin was crispy just like I like it. Accoutrement was broccoli and something else. Dessert I got a walnut cake with a scoop of ice cream which has a name that escapes me. Overall splendid dinner for $42 (without tax). My dining companion got the lamb chops and roasted vegetables.

5.0,3/29/2018,"Limani is certainly one of the best seafood restaurants that the City of New York has to offer. The restaurant serves food with Greek and Mediterranean flairs. It is located at Rockefeller Plaza, opposite Del Frisco's Grille, and near the fountains in the plaza. I would certainly recommend it for anyone who has just attended a matinee Broadway show or for someone who is heading out to an evening show after dinner. My first time here was before a showing of the Lion King. The restaurant itself is beautifully decorated. From the fountain in the center, to the fresh seafood on ice, it is full of ambience. The place happens to be a favorite spot for the WNBC Television anchors, as it is at Rockefeller Center. I've spotted Al Roker and David Price. In terms of the food, it is absolutely impeccable. Anything with seafood is bound to be delicious, it is always fresh. But  that certainly does not mean that the meats are not up to standards. The lamb chops are spectacular. For a restaurant like this, the menu has quite a few selections. There is also a convenient prix-fixe menu that allows you to order three courses. For dessert, I recommend the baklava or sorbet. Raspberry and lemon sorbet are especially good!If the food and decor are this good, then the service must be too! All of the waiters, waitresses, hosts, and hostesses were very friendly. The waitstaff were attentive and helpful. The service was swift, but not to the point where you feel rushed. There was plenty of time to savor each course. Just right. Overall, this restaurant is exceptional. Everything from the food, service and decor are top of the line. I strongly recommend it to anyone, absolutely anyone. Reservations are required, and the dress code is business casual. Most men wear sports jackets. The address is 45 Rockefeller Plaza, and they are open everyday for lunch and dinner. Check the website for the hours. To get to the restaurant, take the IND Sixth Avenue Trains (B,D,F,M), or a city bus or taxi cab. For automobile parking, there are lots near the theatres but I would not recommend driving as it gets difficult to find a spot and congested.

5.0,3/4/2018,"Upscale, delicious, and beautiful - 3 words synonymous with Limani. Limani is located smack dab in the middle of the Rockefeller-Center-tourist-bustle but, definitely worth a trip. My friend hosted her birthday dinner here during the Christmas season. For $55 (not including tax and tip) we were provided the most delicious pre-fixe mediterranean meal I've ever had. Firstly, the decor is beautiful. I mean, from the soft mood lighting, peaceful music, and upscale atmosphere, I felt as if this was the epitome of fine dining. In the middle of the dining room, there is an infinity pool also lit with soft purple hues and a light cloud of smoke pouring out. In the back of the restaurant there is an assortment of fresh seafood on display for sale. Even the downstairs area by the bathroom is admirable and reminiscent of a spa. The sink is filled with assorted sizes of rocks and the beautiful lighting and tile patterns will surely put you at ease. Very unique. Secondly, the food. If you are expecting big plates of food or anything close to what you might expect at say Olive Garden, Red Lobster, or any chain restaurant, leave that idea at the door. With fine dining, the premise (at least in my opinion) is to focus on the beauty of the meal, thats what you will get at Limani. Portions are small when compared to a chain restaurant, who focus on providing value to the customer. No complaints from me on that but that could be an issue for some. Anywho, the pre-fixe dinner includes an appetizer, entree, and dessert; drinks are not included. I decided to go with the tomato salad (appetizer), lamb chops w/greek fries and seasonal veggies (entree), and the honey lavender ice cream (dessert). Everything and I mean everything was so fresh and delicious. The tomato salad included fresh chunky slices of tomato and feta cheese, along with olives and cucumbers. The amb chops were cooked to perfection and seasoned well, very juicy and tender. My favorite part of the meal however, was the honey lavender ice cream. I was really hesitant at first because I thought, who eats lavender? But if you are provided with that option, please try it. The ice cream is smooth and mellow. Its not too sweet and i'm sure they used real milk. I can almost taste it as I write this lol. My friends mostly had the seafood dishes along with either the 'Karidopita' or Baklava desserts. Baklava was extremely sweet. No complaints from anyone. Finally, service. Impeccable and seamless. Now, I will be honest. Our group can be a little on the ratchet side at times lol. The staff at Limani embraced our loudness lol. They sang happy birthday twice to her and had no issues attending to us. Coat check was provided upon seating for free. We also split the check and again, no issues. We were a bit late for our reservation also, no issues. I highly recommend Limani to anyone seeking a great, fine dining experience in the heart of the city. You won't regret it.",6,1,2,Monique M.,"Queens, NY",238,243,1005

Meanwhile I am a businesswoman who dresses well AND was there for the sole purpose of taking out a client, they treated me as if I was a tourist in sweats.As soon as we walked in we were not greeted.  I had to greet the girls at the hostess stand.  Not only that, but the hostesses were rude as if straight out of the Mean Girls movie. Pretty sure customer service is your job ladies so step it up and smile, maybe?We ordered from the lunch menu. We saw the waitress maybe twice. The bus boy had to bring me extra bread for my appetizer. Which also took so long my guest was almost pretty much done with her appetizer, cool.At no point did the waitress ask to refill my drink or my guests drink. The bus boy only filled our water glasses once.We were given our desert dish and when we were a few bites from finished the waitress finally came over asking if we wanted coffee. Too late, but thanks.The food was good, but sadly clouded by the lack of attention by the employees.I am especially bummed because I had been waiting to go to Limani for some time now and it's very disappointing that every part of the service was sub par.

5.0,2/16/2018,"I came here the other night for Valentine's Day and while it is pricey (like many restaurants in the city) they have some of the freshest seafood dishes I've ever tasted! Upon arrival couples were greeted with a rose, with rose petals on the table. I got the lychee martini (so yummy) and my boyfriend got the Rob Roy 12 (something like that I honestly forget). I believe for the Valentine's menu it was $125 per person for 4 courses. We got:1st Course-Tuna TartareSalmon Tartare2nd Course-Shrimp (3 jumbo, grilled)Crab Cake3rd (Main) Course-Filet MignonLobster (2.5 lbs, grilled)(The entrees were served with potatoes and asparagus)4th Course (Dessert)-BaklavaChocolate Covered StrawberriesEach course was super delicious in it's own way. I'm a super seafood lover and I cannot stress how fresh everything tasted. Some restaurants have rubbery shrimp or crab cakes filled with flour/bread crumbs but here you can TASTE and appreciate the actual seafood. The dessert could have been more interesting however I will say the baklava was pretty good. For some reason I expected a better selection than chocolate covered strawberries.

2.0,2/15/2018,"There was very little to love about this place on Valentine's Day. My generous date was far too gracious to complain (& I only made a discreet comment to the waiter as we left) but it must be said here: this place is a huge rip off! He paid nearly $400 for a dinner last night that was mediocre at best in every way (except the company!) First, this space is far less elegant & inviting than it looks online. The vibe was very college dining hall: loud, cold, and stressful. The service was subpar & the food well below average (and such small portions!) The Valentine's Day Prix Fixe for $125 per person sounded great but was four tiny courses. Minuscule, tasteless oysters, a crab cake the size of a quarter (I almost laughed out loud when the put it in front of me!) a a poorly grilled lobster (poor thing lost its life to be presented this way! what a waste!) and dessert for the two of us was dried out baklava & two small chocolate covered strawberries. It literally made me angry on a day that ought to be all about love. The best part of the meal was actually the side dish of lemony potatoes & asparagus. Wines were overpriced ($16 for very small pours) & not great & even the tea must have been expensive because with 3 glasses of wine & a tea between us, the bill came to over well over $300 (I only know because I looked at the bill when my date went to the men's room as they were actually breaking down tables all around us at 11pm!!! They were literally opening doors and hauling garbage through the dining room while people were still eating!!) It was a lovely idea, just based on the website, but don't be fooled.

4.0,2/15/2018,"My boyfriend and I dined at Limani for Valentines Day. We arrived for our reservation at 6:30 and it was not packed. There were definitely people eating there but many tables for two and four were open. The hostess handed every woman a rose when she walked in which was really cute. There were rose petals scattered on the white table cloth as well, a very romantic touch. The waiter was waiting to take our order within minutes of us sitting down. For the first course my boyfriend opted for the salmon tartare and I ordered the tuna tartare. We had our appetizers in the same amount of time that one would wait to get french fries at Shake Shack. By the time I finished one piece of bread the tuna tartare was being placed under my nose. It had to be pre-made and sitting around waiting to be delivered to the table. Nonetheless, both tartare dishes were really, really good. I do have to note, the wait staff did not pace the meal and were trying to get each course out as quickly as possible. For our second course (it was a 4 course pre-fixe meal), my boyfriend ordered grilled jumbo shrimp and I had the octopus. The octopus had roasted red and yellow peppers and thinly shaved onions. The portion was huge and it was absolutely delicious.The texture was soft but not chewy. The octopus was prepared with a decent amount of olive oil but the octopus' flavors were prominent  and it did not taste fishy. I wish I could eat  the octopus again for dinner tonight ! In regards to the shrimp, my boyfriend said ""this shrimp is so buttery/covered in butter"" so they probably put too much olive oil on his shrimp. It was drenched. For the main course, I had the two pound lobster and he ordered the filet mignon. The lobster provided perfect amount of meat for a main course.   It was not served with melted butter on the side. But, butter was not even necessary; it was perfect without it. My boyfriend's filet mignon must have been good because he finished every last bite and he normally complains he's too full and never finishes his steak. For dessert they automatically served one milk chocolate covered strawberry, one white chocolate covered strawberry and baklava. It was my boyfriends first time ever having baklava and he fell in love with it!  He legit cut me a portion then ate the rest because he wanted to enjoy the majority of the dessert.Overall, my experience at Limani was wonderful.

We had read reviews that said the waiters were a bit ""condescending."" We didn't find that at all. They were accommodating and helpful.

Decent deal for restaurant week, although they have a regular price fix menu that is only a few dollars more and has more options. Atmosphere: White, clean, spacious. White. So white. Came for restaurant week brunch, $29 for three courses.Food:Ordered the Mediterranean Meze, which is a large sampler of all the cold hummus and yogurt and cheese dishes. Let me just start by saying the dolmades was not good, and I LOVE dolmades. It was flavorless and the texture was not the best. The other stuff, however, was all pretty tasty and filling and they give you a good amount of pita bread to indulge in with it. For my main I got the chicken breast. Cooked well,but honestly nothing to write home about. Didn't really taste much rosemary and thyme, but it was tender and not too dry. The steamed veggies were cooked well. Dessert, got he karidopita (walnut cake). The cake was good, but again, nothing to write home about, and maybe a little drier than I would have liked. The ice cream served with it though was DELICIOUS. I think it was honey lavender. So subtle and so sweet and so creamy.Service: Prompt, friendly, great.Probably wouldn't drag myself to come here again, but I would recommend it to anyone looking for a reasonably priced Greek restaurant in midtown.",1,1,3,Tiffany O.,"Newark, NJ",314,516,1390

We added the cucumber, tomato, feta salad with beautiful vegetables even though it was February.  We both had the grilled deboned dorado.  Perfectly cooked, fresh, light, flaky.  All you could ask for in a fish entree.  And the 1 pound whole fish was a generous portion size.  We finished with the karidopita.  It was a medium dense walnut cake, with nutty crunch, molasses notes, probably cinnamon, maybe clove.  Not too sweet.

It took the servers three attempts to serve me until they got it right (first bringing me the octopus, then bringing me the tomato salad). The sea bass which I had for my main was served unattractively split open and overcooked, not to mention all the little bones inside. The ice cream for dessert was decent, but the scoops were quite small and served on a massive plate.

We started out with zucchini chips that are to die for, traditional Greek salad with the most amazing flavors, and the best thing in the place....grilled octopus!!! So flavorful i could eat ten orders of them! Our entrees were divine, swordfish, pink snapper, steak- everything was just perfect. It's pricey but I can honestly say it's one of the best places I've eaten. The ONLY thing I don't like about this place is the restrooms are all the way downstairs...two long flights of stairs.

4.0,10/10/2017,"Excellent Greek restaurant.  I am kinda into Mediterranean food and I can assure you that this is a reliable Greek place in midtown Manhattan.  I had lunch there and ordered a terrific 3-course meal (for about $36).  I first had the octopus with its grilled veggies: fair share, tasty octopus, not too oily, great veggies (mostly red and yellow peppers).  I then asked for the grilled salmon with its brocolis.  Salmon was about 5 inches long, 3 inches large, and 1 inch heigh.  It was really good, a bit too much oily to my taste though, and the brocolis were just ok.  As a desert, I ordered the greek yogurt with honey and walnuts, very good. However, the share a bit small.  This is therefore a great meal for this kind of price: do not expect the shares to be big though as they are competitive on the pricing, especially in this area.  As to the waiters, the service is good, we did not wait for too long.  The place is nice, not really noisy, and the ""Greekish"" atmosphere (mostly white and blue walls, ceilings, tables etc) does the job.  To conclude, I think it's kinda hard to find a great spot in midtown Manhattan for lunch, so this is definitely a nice place to remembter.",0,0,0,K B.,"New York, NY",82,23,43

The tsipoura was beautifully grilled and tasty, as if we were in Greece. The kolokithi starter, thin-sliced zucchini and eggplant with fried cheese and thick tzatziki tasted good but arrived at room temperature (for just-fried food that means it had been sitting on the counter instead of being served right away; on a night when the restaurant was only half-full, there's no excuse for that). We ordered two galaktoboureko, a milk/cream custard topped with phyllo, and the cream had turned sour--which can only happen if the dessert was made ages ago or had been improperly refrigerated (Kitchen Nightmares episode?) When we sent them back, they did bring a galaktoboureko they had ""just made"" which was fresh and delicious. Why not throw spoiled things away rather than serving them?

I came here for my anniversary on September 3rd expecting to be wowed by the decor.  It was indeed very beautiful but there were two things bizarrely out of place:The beautiful reflecting pool in the center of the restaurant hadn't been cleaned in some time and there was literally fungus growing on the tiles under the water. I thought I must be imagining things so I looked really closely and you could see the little bits of moss growing against the white background. Why on earth they would spend so much time and energy making the restaurant absolutely drop-dead gorgeous, and then let the pool be filthy is beyond me. They also didn't replace the toilet paper in the bathroom stalls so my fiancé had to switch stalls to get toilet paper. A minor thing, but after $250 for two people on dinner it seemed worth mentioning.The food is excellent, especially the octopus, crab cakes, lobster, and lamb chops.

The lop du mer was cooked perfectly but i think it could have used a tad bit more seasoning. I will recommend to eat tge fish with the capers provided. It added that extra pop of flavor to it and brought the fish alive. The lamb was cooked well and flavored nicely but my pieces were a little fatty. I had to get the dessert after all its RW. I ordered the ice cream scoops, pistachio and  honey vanilla i believe. The pistachio was very nutty as if they were in the back cracking pistachios to add into the ice cream. Nice flavor.

Milos could be quite a ""scene"" and when you're not looking for that and simply want to sit down to a pleasant, quiet meal - Limani has it covered. I'm not a fan of Rockefeller Center and always avoided it like the plague but since Limani is located there, I find myself venturing there more often. The restaurant was quite spacious with an indoor fountain and a cool backlit bar. Having ample space and privacy when it comes to seating at Limani was quite a luxury, considering all the cozy, quaint restaurants in the city with bumper-to-bumper tables. As for the food, what can I say? So darn delicious! I have tried plenty of dishes and always end up ordering the Horiatiki Greek salad. It is simply the best in the city! As for their fish, they have quite a limited selection compared to Milos but what they do have were always the freshest and tasted so delectable! I simply love all their fish. Something so simple as a grilled fish with sprinkles of capers and lemon juice can't be beat here in Limani. Service was always consistent and we usually end up with the same waiter, who always took such great care of us. Last but not least, their fresh mint tea was to die for!

The menu is vast and covers traditional greek options, vegetarian options and many choices for those who love the bounties of the sea. The center piece of ocean inspired art is hard to look away from and the white linen tables and professional waiters offer a welcome retreat from mid-town Manhattan. Prices are what you would expect. The noise level is high and, like most restaurants in the area, they cram a lot of people into a sizable, open space. The spanakopita was warm and comfort food at it's best, the taziki offered a fresh pop of flavor, and the salad was crunchy and satisfying. The portions are not large so it's perfect for a business lunch (beware of the noise level) and they do offer a dinner Pre Fixe menu. The highlight of the menu is the desserts (and you won't be stuffed from the main courses). Don't shy away from the Greek Yogurt and Honey.

3.0,4/5/2017,"Went for their Valentine's Day special, and unfortunately, it was organized a bit messily. Our reservation was for 8:30 PM, booked via OpenTable, but we still waited 30 minutes to be seated, and there was a huge crowd waiting in the front. When we were seated though, things got much better. The Valentine's Day menu has a pre-set menu, and you select from the options they have (2-3 selections per course). First Course:I got the Patzaria (root beets and skordalia) while my boyfriend got the blue point oysters. Wonderful presentation, and the first time I've ever had root beets as a dish. It was tender and interestingly bittersweet, and a refreshing start to a fancy dinner. The blue point oysters were what you'd expect of oysters, so don't expect some fancy, unique, out-of-this world flavor. It's literally oysters.  Second Course: Ordered the crab cake and grilled octopus for appetizer. Crab cake was mediocre and bland. Grilled octopus was wonderfully tender and savory, but they give a lot per serving, so you're surprisingly a bit full at that point. Entree:Filet mignon was juicy, cooked to medium rare perfection, and filling. Boyfriend got the lobster (you get 2.5 lobsters per dish) which was plated on some light butter sauce. Both were standard and good.   Dessert:Baklava and chocolate strawberries. Desserts are my specialty, as I love baking. Baklava was not very good - stale and crusty, and the chocolate strawberries were horribly made. Side Note: We also ordered something NOT offered on the Valentine's menu which they gladly made for us as an exception since we inquired about it. Not sure of the name, but it's basically zucchini chips stacked in a tower with greek sauce in the middle. This was THE BEST dish because the zucchini chips were amazingly crispy and thin, and complemented perfectly by the tangy sauce! All the other dishes were mediocre - good, but I understand that when making things in masses for a huge crowd on Valentine's Day, quality will be outshone by quantity and timeliness. Regardless, the ambiance and service were stellar, and I imagine that their food on a non-holiday is good-excellent quality.",2,0,1,C J.,"Warren, NJ",457,59,2

The waiters took so long to come back that instead of sending it back I just ate the parts that seemed fine and left the rest alone.

2.0,2/8/2017,"I would have given this restaurant 5 stars had our service been better. Don't get me wrong, the food was delicious and we had a very nice bus boy who took a nice picture of my friends at the bar. Here's where this place went wrong:My friends and I came here for restaurant week and as soon as we walked in we instantly felt isolated. We had reservations but even so, they decided to sit us as close to the door as possible even though the restaurant wasn't full. I didn't think much of this until other events transpired ( I'll get there). We felt constantly rushed throughout our meal. The wait staff kept circling our table and towards the end of our meal while we were finishing up our cocktails and desert the waitress lays our check on our table before we even finished up our drinks. It was if to say it's time for you and your minority friends to go. We were instantly insulted by this; you couldn't wait for us to ask for the check? This was the same courtesy you gave the table next to us. Couldn't you at least have waited until we finished our drinks? And how do they know we weren't going to order something else? Well, it was extremely rude and they just missed out on a chance to get another order from us. We decided to let the check sit there while we talk amongst ourselves because we paid for this experience and if we want to sit here a few mins we will. While we were sitting there talking and finishing up our drinks the waitress circles our table 7-9 times to see if we paid our check. I was just thinking like this is so rude? Why are you babysitting us? You didn't you babysit the table full of white woman next to us who were participating in restaurant week as well; you allowed them to ask for their check and leave on their own accord. It wasn't like we were sitting there for hours, we had JUST finished desert and were drinking. We weren't disruptive, just quietly talking to one another.  The whole thing was very unsettling and uncomfortable and they will not get our hard earned money again. Here a tip: Next time treat all of your customers the same. When they come, not matter what their skin color is, they are using their hard earned money and deserve the same respect as everyone else.",2,1,0,Taillur M.,"Manhattan, NY",56,3,1

I had the tomato salad (GOOD but two of my tomatoes were soggy) , the lamb chops were were greaaaaat. I only eat lamb if it's Greek/middle eastern seasoned so this was perfect. I had three good sized chops, tasty fries and broccoli and cauliflower. It was a big portion and I'm still surprised I couldn't finish, but trust me I was really trying to. Somehow I managed to squeeze in the karidopita for dessert- walnut cake with LAVENDER ice cream, which i totally fell in love with.

2.0,2/1/2017,"I visited Limani for their restaurant week lunch specials.The entire restaurant is pristine white- the tables, the chairs, and the floor. I think they were going for a trendy look but all the whiteness made it feel a little sterile. There was a large blue pool in the middle which from afar looked neat against the white background. However, when I got closer I noticed it was actually pretty dirty and hadn't been cleaned in a while. It gets very crowded around 12:30 with midtown professionals. I would recommend making a reservation or getting to the restaurant before 12PM if you want to secure a seat without a wait. The restaurant week menu was pretty extensive with both seafood and meat options (no vegetarian options though!). I chose the tomato salad as my appetizer which was pretty delicious. The tomatoes were plentiful and very fresh. Another good option my co-workers raved about was the scallops. The avocado salad was also a favorite but it is a very small portion. For my entrée I choose the chicken which was pretty bland and a little too tough for me. I really had to work to cut into it. I think most of my co-workers were more impressed with their appetizer than entrée choice. The dessert I tried the karidopita with ice cream which was my favorite part of the meal. Overall, I think this restaurant is trying to be upscale and trendy but it just doesn't cut it. The décor is too sterile and the food isn't anything exceptional to command the high prices.

4.0,11/25/2016,"I'll admit that I was a little nervous about my plan for eating here before seeing a show on Wednesday night. Being the night before Thanksgiving, it was understandable that the restaurant would be less crowded than it might usually be, but there was virtually no one else here at 6 PM, and the decor lent itself to be flashy (a lot of white leather seating) that screamed of superficiality. The drink menu is okay - the beer selection is wanting, but the couple of cocktails I had were decent. If anything, I felt that this was probably a spot that was going to feel more like a restaurant meant to lure tourists than anything.Then the food came out - and was I surprised in a good way! I will say that if you come outside of theatre-pricing hours, the food is definitely on the expensive side. But at $42 for an appetizer, a main course, and dessert, the prix fixe is definitely worth it. The most notable thing about the food here is that it's simple - the goal isn't to be as fancy or complex as possible, but to instead rely on the simple flavors of the Mediterranean that make the food quite delicious in its own right. The bread served were toasted slices of bread with olive oil - a nice, simple way to start, but I did like the crisp that a medium-level toast gave to the bread. I went with the fried calamari to start - very lightly fried, which is a nice change from many places, with a rich tomato-based sauce with a touch of cream to make it smoother. My wife went with the grilled octopus, which was a revelation. Served with the usual herbs you might find (capers, dill), it still retained the chewiness that octopus meat has but with the deeper flavors that grilling brings out. Our mains were similarly simple but delicious as well. I had the lamb chops; with three smaller-sized chops, it's the right amount for one person, and the meat is cooked to medium - which worked just fine, although the meat could have been a tad juicier. There's no sauce or marinades, but none is needed, as the flavoring of the meat is plenty rich on its own. Alternatively, the whole fish (my wife got the branzino) was simple and tasty as well, with the flakes coming off easily and served with the same capers and herbs that the octopus had. For dessert, the fresh fruit is not worth it - you can find better quality fruit at the Whole Foods or a farmer's market - but the karidopita (a rich bread-like walnut cake) served with ice cream tinged with olive oil was a nice, hearty way to end a meal that tended towards the lighter side.I was definitely surprised by the quality of the food here, and although I question some of the descriptions on the page (the 'live' langoustines certainly did not look alive sitting on ice), the preparation of the food is excellent and true to its roots. I would definitely come back, but again - I think any sort of prix fixe option is going to be a better bang for your buck than ordering a la carte.",4,0,1,Asuka N.,"New York, NY",371,1653,169

Every member of the staff was very friendly and made us feel very welcome - a truly hospitable experience from the very beginning, starting with our server Ily. We ordered a full course dining menu to get the whole experience: we started off with a Greek salad, the carabineiros prawns, and the Greek kefalograviera cheese saganaki. The salad was delicious and plentiful, the saganaki was exceptional, and the real treat were the carabineiros - sweeter than the langoustines, and after I  drizzled them with sherry wine they became godly. The main event was a grilled loup de mer encased in a salt crust; prepared and served table-side, it was among the most delicious fish I've had; comparable to Milos restaurant if not better. We matched our food with some fine Greek Assyrtiko wine from Santorini (you can never go wrong with a bottle of Thalassitis) which matched our food superbly. At the end we were offered complimentary dessert which was a very nice gesture on their part, truly appreciated. Again, I want to emphasize the high quality of the professionalism and hospitality offered at this establishment throughout the entire dinner service .

LOVE LOVE LOVED everything about the restaurant from the greeting, service, food, décor to the dessert.One word:Kolokithi - which is paper thin zucchini and eggplant served with lightly fried kefalograviera cheese and tzatziki.  Was the most amazing appetizer and a MUST ORDER if you come to this restaurant.  I promise you won't be disappointed.  (it's one of the first pictures of yelp stacked high)My friend comes to this restaurant often, so as we walked in they warmly greeted us and made sure an order of Kolokithi was already being made and on its way !! AmaaazinggggggOther highlights include the greek salad, and the octopus.  Deliciousness and perfectly cooked.For our main course we ordered the branzino which was also cooked perfectly.  Everything tasted super fresh.  Even dessert was amazingggggggg the fruit platter was served with this amazing greek yogurt with honey and walnuts yummmm...  The chocolate cake and other specialty dessert were worth the calories for sureeee.  They even wrote a special message in chocolate since my friend was asking me to be a bridesmaid in her wedding.  Loved it and can't wait to go back!!!",1,0,0,Lauren A.,"New York, NY",237,239,442

3.0,8/14/2016,"Used to like this place for lunch, but have become disappointed and probably won't be back anytime soon. Fixed price lunch special has continued to get more expensive (think it was 22.95 when it first opened not that long ago, and up to 27.95 now?), and perhaps I've just gotten bored of the food, but I've been really disappointed in the shrimp risotto the past couple times I've had it. Shrimp were overcooked, and the portions (at least of this particular dish) are small enough that you're hungry when you leave unless you get the Karidopita for dessert (which is quite tasty, by the way). Also, they need to either train or replace most of the hostess staff and hire courteous, friendly professionals who treat customers with respect instead of standing there with their lips pursed like models, and talking to you in that quiet, icy tone that's trying to make you feel like you're somewhere that's such a big deal when it's really not. 5* for the ambiance--it seriously rocks. 3* for food. 2* for service.

4.0,8/8/2016,"Limani seems underrated and scoffed at due to its Midtown meets Miami vibe but the food is really quite good. Came here with a party of 5 for restaurant week. The selection is fair and the ressie was easy to get.  Service getting to our seats/the bar was not optimal but the actual waitstaff once dinner began, it wasn't bad. They were decent about water refill and making dish suggestions.  We all ordered the restaurant week menu.  They gave us some yummy warm bread with good olive oil. I had the:- Fried Calamari - very flavorful, lightly fried.  Yummy aioli.  Yummy. Most people got the tender, grilled octopus which was dressed well and well grilled. It was a $5 supplement but worth it.- I had the whole Canadian lobster (1.5 lb) with deliciously light Greek seasoned fries .. it was a $8 supplement. I did not enjoy the tail/body part as much as it was kind of... too grilled and charred. But I did get like the claw and other nuggets  The fries were very good. A lot of others at the table got the whole sea bass which was well cooked in butter, capers, lemon.  The only bad thing is that there were a lot of bones. -I had the kardiopita for desset which is basically a walnut sponge cake. It was moist and deliciously soaked in honey but really the real deal was the ice cream. It was some lavender flavor which was so delicious. Others had the fresh fruit for dessert (champagne grapes, berries, melons), and the baklava which looked good and wasn't too sweet apparently ($5 extra).We ordered glasses and bottles of wine- from Sancerre (my favorite) at the bar to some white which I forget the name but it was $75 a bottle and pretty decent",6,0,3,Stephanie Y.,"New York, NY",878,1242,25
4.0,8/5/2016,"This is my absolute favorite spot for a nice lunch around 30 Rock.  The lunch menu is a pretty good deal -- 3 courses for a little less than 30$.  I usually opt for the octopus salad (+$8) to start, with the branzino or dorado as the main, and finish with fruits.  To begin, the bread is warm right out of the oven, and has a rich flavor to it.  The octopus is what keeps me coming back -- tender yet not rubbery.  It's absolutely amazing.  The branzino and dorado are white fish, and very subtle flavoring without too much salt.  It's the typical Mediterranean style of cooking with lots of olive oil and lemons, and just a pinch of salt, so it's relatively healthy too.  I usually only get the fruits since ya know, constant diet, but the sorbets and karidopita look really good.  Maybe next time when I'm feeling ambitious. This place is great for lunch with coworkers, or even somewhere to take your clients.",2,0,0,Helen C.,"New York, NY",99,66,63

3.0,7/27/2016,"So I came here once last year for RW dinner and it was FABULOUS.  The food was delicious, the service was great, and the ambiance was terrific.  So when my boss chose this restaurant for a business lunch, I was excited to try this place again.  Unfortunately, my second experience was pretty much TERRIBLE.We came yesterday afternoon and took advantage of the prie fix menu (the RW lunch was the same).  I ordered the scallops as my appetizer (it was TINY - literally only had 3 thumb-sized scallops.  and 2-3 clementine sized orange wedges.  My coworker and I regretted it so much because any other dish would have been better.  The scallop appetizers I've gotten at other restaurants feature giant scallops so 3 would have been perfect but these were MINUSCULE).  Then I had the shrimp saganaki.  First, there was an HOUR wait between the appetizer and our entree.  We were sitting there for so long until we finally asked our waitress where our food was.  Every time we asked someone, they told us it was coming.  After an hour, we commented that the food was probably coming from Greece so it was taking way too long.  Everyone else around us had finished their 3 course meal before our entree even showed up.  Second, my dish was TINY.  There were literally 4 shrimps which, admittedly, were a decent size.  Probably a large shrimp.  Definitely not jumbo.  But the risotto that was supposed to come with the dish?  Probably the size of two thumbs put together.  It was that small.  I picked the saganaki thinking it would be filling since I was starving.  That was NOT the case.  I still felt incredibly hungry after the whole meal was over.  Third, the dish was COLD.  It wasn't even lukewarm.  It was as if they had just left it sitting there for the hour that we waited.  But at that point, I didn't want it to get sent back since we had all already waited an hour for our food.  I didn't particularly want to wait another hour for a new dish to come out.The dessert I chose was the greek yogurt.  It was just normal - nothing standard or special about it.  Overall, yesterday's experience has made me put off Limani for the future.  DO NOT go there unless you want to wait forever and DO NOT go there if you want some hot delicious food.  Terribly disappointed.",6,0,0,Stefany W.,"Manhattan, NY",202,214,33
1.0,7/26/2016,"Very disappointed with this restaurant. I went there for restaurant week lunch. It's $29 (excluding tax and tips), 3 courses. The wait was way too long (45min between first and main course). The food quality was poor. I had the Avocado salad, which really is an Avocado cut in half with 3 baby shrimps on top. Then the risotto, which was super tiny and not very well seasoned. And the fruit salad, well it was just 1 slice of melon and 1 slice of watermelon. Lucky for me, I still had leftovers in the fridge at the office!The only good feedback I can give is on the ambiance: the restaurant looks nice.

3.0,7/25/2016,"Tucked away on the quieter-ish side of rock center is Limani, your little Greek oasis in the middle of midtown. The restaurant is very sleek and modern; influenced by a Santorini color palette with crisp white linens and chairs and azul blue accents. The outdoor space is tucked between the alley way between 51st and 50th street giving way to some foot traffic but top-notch people watching. A plus here are the enormous umbrellas at each table to shield you from the those UV rays and summer showers. I've only been for happy hour but I've heard from co-workers that the lunch prix fix is well worth a try. Happy hour offers up $10 wine and cocktails that pack a punch. The meze platter is enough for 3-4 to share, be sure to ask for more pita. The calamari is also a good dish to split but don't come too hungry, these apps are on the smaller side. I'd say this is a good spot for the after-work crew or for taking advantage of their outdoor space. While the midtown scene doesn't offer up much in terms of happy hour spots, this is a good one to put on your rotation if you work in the area.",3,1,2,Stephanie S.,"New York, NY",94,153,102

For my entree I ordered the shrimp saganaki which was in a tomato feta sauce and served with risotto. The shrimp was good and the tangy sauce complemented nicely, however there were only four pieces of shrimp with a small ball of risotto in the corner. I knew I was still hungry so I started eating more bread to fill up..For dessert I had the Karidopita which is a walnut/carrot tasting cake bread served with vanilla ice cream.

4.0,6/24/2016,"Limani is a very solid choice for a refined dining option in the middle of a busy work day.First, the food was generally on point. House bread and house oil are solid. No complaints, but also not the best bread I've had (Hearth in east village is a bit better for bread IMO)For appetizers, we had the sea scallops and avocado salad. The sea scallops were very fresh but they were grilled, not seared, which was interesting. Two scallops in an appetizer wasn't bad but the orange segments weren't cut correctly (there was some pith left) so I was not sure about the knife work in the kitchen. The avocado salad is essentially 3 small shrimp on top of an avocado but it was perfectly ripe and tasty so I have no complaints.For mains, we had the lamb chops and fish of the day (I chose the loup de mer aka sea bass). 2 lamb chops per order - my dining companion ordered medium rare but they were definitely a bit on the rare side. The portions are a bit strange with 2 chops, 3 pieces of broccoli, and a pile of fries. The fries were passable. I thought the fish was a great entree: an entire small sea bass, deboned, seasoned with some capers, lemon, and herbs. Watch out, the bones aren't 100% clear, so be careful. The fish was very fresh and firm.For desserts, we had the yogurt and the karidopita. The yogurt is great; it's strained to the point where it's thick enough to stand up in a mound (like stiff peak meringue) and they drizzle a very fragrant honey all over it. The yogurt is not that tangy but very rich- tastes a little almost like mascarpone. The karidopita is in a generous portion and it seems like the bottom half of it is more soaked in syrup. Overall, it's like a banana bread/carrot cake like texture and taste. It's moist, sweet, and nutty as well. The ice cream may have been lavender? And overall, the dessert is flavored with nutmeg and mace, I believe.As for everything else, the dining room is gorgeous, service is great.

They were very rubbery and not seasoned at all. No hint of flavor. Very disappointing because a single scallop is such a delicacy!Salmon - I asked for medium rare, but I do not think the fish was fresh; it tasted as if it came previously frozen.  Each bite turned into mush in my mouth.  I did not taste the salmon's varying flavor notes. Each bite somehow turned into mush in my mouth.  It was so off-putting that I was unable to eat more than 1/4 of the piece.I wish I had something good to say, other than the beautiful decor (the bathroom downstairs is as beautiful as well), but each dish was more disappointing than the next.  Perhaps I dined at a bad time?

5.0,3/13/2016,"BEAUTIFUL venue and top-notch food.  Don't you just love the chic white decor and that infinity pool?  I love that they have a location in midtown near my office now.  You come here for the seafood.  You can even take a look at it before it gets cooked (it is neatly displayed near the front).  I've been here enough times to have tried most items on their menu.  I usually start with a Greek salad or those delicious zucchini crisps.  Then, the loup de mer!  MMM, if you like whole, de-boned fish like sea bass drenched with olive oil, oregano, and lemons, this is the real deal!  It is perfectly cooked.  I love that it comes with a single, large broccoli leaflet too.  Then I usually top it off with Greek yogurt and Greek coffee - sketo.  The lobster pasta is really good too and the presentation is so pretty with the entire lobster on your plate!  Oh and the scallops; the shrimp avocado; the spreads; the marouli salad; the spreads!  Ok, you just can't go wrong here!  I've been here for dinner as well and it's just as good.  Somewhat pricier, but, hey, you're at Rock Plaza and the quality of the ingredients here are excellent so it's worth it.  Service is top notch too.  Lunch time is insane.  I guess this is no longer the ""best kept secret"" in the area anymore.  See you soon, Limani.",0,0,0,Gee L.,"New York, NY",231,156,1518
3.0,3/13/2016,"Visited this restaurant during restaurant week lunch. It is very beautiful and elegant with white everything, and some ocean feeling decorations. There is a water area in the middle and is very pretty. We had a nice lunch for our date. Food was clean and presented very nice. I ordered the octopus salad, salmon entree, and lemon sorbet for dessert. The Octopus salad was overall the best part of the lunch. It was delicious! The salmon entree was alright however I am just really picky about cooked fish. The sorbet was good because I wanted something sour, however my boyfriend did order the walnut cake that I thought was pretty good. Overall the lunch was good, but not memorable except for the octopus salad. We were a bit underwhelmed for the price we paid. Therefore, 1 star off. I would like to come back and try their Sea Bass and Mezz appetizer sometime which might change my mind!Another star was docked off due to the fact since the lighting is bright and everything is white, we were able to see some stains and wear and tear on seating which felt bit tacky.  Decoration and style was great in the restroom as well however the lock on the bathroom door was broken.",2,0,1,Emily Y.,"New York, NY",198,240,1020
4.0,3/12/2016,"Octopus never tasted so good! That appetizer (served as sashimi) was by far the highlight of our meal - if you're going please order it and you won't regret it!I stopped by Limani with several coworkers as well as one of our vendors - meaning we didn't have to pick up the tab and we could go all out on this fun Friday lunch. We started with a round of cocktails, my first drink, the Midas was excellent, the cracked pepper served around the rim added the perfect amount of flavor/kick to the cocktail. Eventually moved onto the Metaxin for my second cocktail, which unfortunately didn't taste as strong and actually felt slightly watered down. We ordered several appetizers and as previously mentioned the octopus was a unanimous favorite in our group. The crab cake; however, was not nearly as delicious - it tasted slightly bland even after incorporating the extra sauces, definitely could have used a little more flavor.Entree prices were through the roof! which I guess is expected for a corporate midtown lunch scene - but let's just say I'd never swing by on my own dime despite how delicious some of the food was.

Decor/Atmosphere: This is by far the best part of Limani. The ambience resembles an ocean and is absolutely gorgeous.

4.0,2/5/2016,"My fondest memory of Limani was at their Long Island branch, where they still offer one of the best Sunday brunch buffets in recent memory.  After all, who doesn't love AYCE lobster, even for a steep price?Fast forward to now, where they opened a Manhattan outpost by 30 Rock and I decided to try out their dinner service.  While their Restaurant Week menu might not be as comprehensive as other places, there's no doubt the quality of the food still stands.  For the appetizer I ordered the calimari.  It was perfect in terms of flavor, texture and did not feel heavy.  The spicy mayo sauce was also excellent.  I also got the sea bass as my entree and it was extremely tasty.  As expected with good Mediterranean food, the experience was light, flavorful and left me very satisfied.  The moist traditional Greek walnut cake was really an excellent way to round out a solid meal.The service here was friendly and relatively attentive.  My only issue was that some of the tables were really close to each other and the restaurant gets pretty cold if you are unfortunately seated near the door during wintertime.  Otherwise, this place delivers and is worth a visit.",4,5,5,Kevin W.,"Manhattan, NY",1288,747,1078
3.0,2/3/2016,"Came here for restaurant week lunch with a group of 9 people.  I would give the restaurant a 4 star for the food.  I knocked it down a star for the service.  Considering this is an upscale Greek-Mediterranean restaurant, I would have expected better service.  Note: They took our credit card info when making the reservation.  I didn't make the reservation (so the details aren't too clear), but I think there is a fee if you cancel and possibly have less people show up then the original reservation number.Appetizer: Fresh scallops - 2 small pieces of grilled scallops garnished with citrus and olive oil (good).  Avocado salad - small baby shrimp (seasoned perfectly) and half an avocado.  Grilled Octopus - excellent ($8 supplement)Main Course: Lamb Chops - 2 pieces grilled medium served with Greek fries, cauliflower, and broccoli (great)($5 supplement).  Organic Chicken Breast - average, it's chicken.  shrimp Saganaki - about 5 pieces of sauteed shimp in a tomato and feta sauce served with a spoonful of risotto (good - but not very filling).Dessert: Karidopita (walnut cake + ice cream) [excellent!].  Lemon sorbet very tart.  Strawberry sorbet also very tart.  Fresh fruit - plate of grapefruit and some berries.  Yiaourti (yogurt + honey) [good].",0,0,0,M W.,"New York, NY",1,58,20
4.0,2/2/2016,"I had a great restaurant week experience. We selected this restaurant to celebrate my husband's birthday and it didn't disappoint. I made reservations through OpenTable and it was nice to see they honored my request to sit near the gorgeous infinity pool - probably the best area to sit in the entire restaurant. The atmosphere is stunning. Very clean, modern and great lighting. The eye catcher is that infinity pool in the middle with a blue lit aura. Lovely! We were seated quickly. It's nice to see both the restaurant week and regular menu. We ordered and the food came out fast but all very fresh. Grilled octopus - nicely done. Well cooked and well seasoned. Big portion for appetizer. Fried calamari - delicious! Doesn't feel oily or heavily fried and the seasoning in the batter was divine. That dipping sauce was very good. Not sure what it was but it complemented well. Tomato salad - fresh cut tomatoes, peppers, onions and feta cheese. Dressing was light and good match for this type of salad. Grilled vegetables - typical grilled zucchini and peppers but the stand out was the halloumi cheese! I need to find me some of that goodness. Great texture and perfectly grilled. Filet mignon - nicely seasoned but my husband wished they cooked it to the temperature he asked for. Lamb chops - highly recommend this dish. Surprised at how it was done right and the flavors were so amazing. Tender, juicy and easy to chew! Came with broccoli and cauliflower with Greek fries. That was just okay. The scene stealer were the lamb chops!Karidopita - this walnut cake was just okay. Grainy on top, sweet on the bottom from the syrup that the cake soaked up. Our waiter told us it came with pistachio ice cream which I was very excited about, however, to my disappointment it came with vanilla ice cream. But despite that snafu, I'll say their ice cream was very creamy and smooth. And more brownie points because they gave us a candle in the cake for my hubby. I didn't have to even ask! Really appreciate that. Fresh fruit - you can't botch fresh fruit. This was fine. They were very nice to give us an extra plate of fresh fruit for my hubby's birthday. Baklava - nice and fresh. Always a good choice at a Mediterranean restaurant. Bathroom is located downstairs. It's a really nice spot and nicely decorated inside. Those sinks with the rocks are pretty. The walls are pretty too - inspirational for those who want to decorate. Too bad the floor was a bit sticky. Overall, the service was great and the food was delicious. Great restaurant week experience without heavily breaking the bank. To top it off, the restaurant ambiance is lovely!

The two scallops arrived with orange slices and citrus sauce. The scallops were tender, juicy, and well done--simply amazing.For main course, my friend got jumbo shrimps with risotto. The portion was appetizer size--four shrimps and a tiny circle of risotto. My friend left hungry. I ordered the fish of the day--dorado, which was tender and nicely cooked with good spices and citrus sauce. Satisfying entree, though nothing extraordinary.For dessert, we both got the walnut sponge cake that came with a scoop of ice cream.

5.0,1/27/2016,"Came here for Restaurant Week, so this may skew the business, as well as the portions and whatnot, but I'll be honest either way! The space was great - so large and spacious! It did get kind of loud, but I was here during the middle of lunch during restaurant week, so that could definitely explain it! At the same time, it's in the middle of a pretty busy both corporate and tourist area, so it might always be this busy and loud around lunch time and possible less so for dinner. Once it got a little later, things quieted down. The food was fantastic, as was the service and the portion sizes were great. I got the avocado salad from the Restaurant Week menu to start, which was simple but had a lot of flavor. Split the mezze appetizer as my mom's app, also from the Restaurant Week menu, so not sure how big it is normally (or if it's even offered), but it was fantastic. I do wish the waiter had taken the time to explain which dish was what, but having eaten this cuisine frequently allowed us to figure it out as we went. Each one was as good as the last! As my entree, I got the jumbo shrimp, which seemed like a small portion size (as did the tiny bit of risotto that came with it, but because the mezze appetizer was so large, it ended up being just enough! Super flavorful! For desert I had the fresh fruit which was kind of sour (not having gone bad, just not sweet enough), but I assume fruit isn't their specialty...Other than that, I noticed that the bathrooms were extremely clean, although somewhat hard to locate. The decor seemed to go with a nautical theme with ""fish nets"" and such, but they should have just stuck to the blue and white more elegant side of it because the dark nets take away from how pretty the rest of the space is.",4,0,0,Monica F.,"New York, NY",163,193,140
1.0,1/27/2016,"Came here for a corporate lunch which seems the theme as there were suits worn across the floor. The decor is beautiful and if you get a seat near the centre water feature then you are in the hot spot. However, as we checked in we were ushered to our seats in the downstairs room in which we thought we would see a horses head similar to mafia style appear, this was quite weird as it was only two of us. I went during restaurant week and the lunch menu was delicious I had scallops to start which were very well cooked, the salmon  next which tasted delicious and the yoghurt with honey to finish which I loved. The courses are small which I like as it is perfect and not too filling for an afternoon in the office, however if you like a more substantial meal I would go for the lobster pasta which I was recommended by a colleague and looked hearty.I was very disappointed with the service hence the rating, we were told to stop talking and order as the kitchen was busy thus our meals would take a while to arrive, being told we could talk once we had ordered which is extremely rude, we are not school children but paying customers. Note our meals came extremely quickly. We were then abruptly interrupted  and asked if we had finished our starter which we were clearly still working on. The whole service was appalling.

The restaurant itself was beautiful! The wait staff was very attentive. The ambience was sexy. Some may say pretentious but HEY this is Manhattan and this is why you came here.

3.0,1/10/2016,"I've dined at the Roslyn Limani location a few years back and the NYC one is no different (just a bit smaller). Like many of these types of spots, it's beautiful inside, the service is good, and you feel like a hot shot paying too much for very little. But I must emphasize, you don't come here for the food, you come here to see-and-be-seen. There's a difference, and the foodie in me always gets frustrated.I came here after a Broadway show on a Sunday evening in honor of my mom's birthday. Each in our party, a total of four, ordered from the $39/person prix fixe menu. We shared all four appetizer options: octopus (+$5), salad, grilled vegetables, and fried calamari. The octopus was good, the salad was fine, pretty standard, the calamari was decent but I've certainly had better, and the grilled vegetables were pathetic. They give a sliver of pepper, a sliver of eggplant, and two zucchini slivers with some grilled halloumi. It was a nothing plate I feel bad for anyone who orders it off the regular menu.For my entree I had the salmon which was simple and good, as many Greek dishes are. I tasted my dad's lamb chops which were also good. My brother had the steak and my mother had a different branzino-type of fish and both were happy. However, the true star of the entrees were the fries that came with the lamb and steak. So good.For dessert we got the walnut sponge cake and an order of sorbet. Sorbet was blah, but that's never my thing. The cake itself was forgettable but whatever the ice cream was that came with it was the best part, and I'm not even a lover of ice cream.Anyway, don't let my three stars turn you off, I'm just not a fan of these types of restaurants.

First off- Limani is in a great location. It's literally a 2 minute walk from Rockefeller Center. When I walked into the restaurant I was pleasantly surprised. I felt like I was in a high scale restaurant in Miami! Limani is gorgeous!!! The lights are dim and there's blue lighting everywhere, and a waterfall table in the middle of the restaurant. We had reservations at 8:15, we arrived a few minutes early but our table wasn't ready so the hostess asked us to wait at the bar area. The bartender was excellent, he was a tall, young, blonde haired guy. Super handsome with amazing hair! We were seated and our waiter explained the huge selection of fish they offer, which was amazing. They have the entire selection of fish in the back of the restaurant that you can view. Our waiter explained each type of fish to us. He was really helpful! For our dinners my BF ordered the filet mignon which came with Greek fries & asparagus. His meal was delicious. The asparagus was perfect, cooked in a lemon garlic butter sauce. The steak was perfect and so flavorful. He loved it!!I ordered the Dover sole (a la carte) with a side of broccoli rabe & feta. I was a little disappointed with the broccoli rabe, it didn't have much flavor. But the fish was excellent! For dessert we shared the baklava with lavender icecream. The baklava looked REALLY DRY when it came out. But once I tried it, OMG DELICIOUS! One of the best tasting baklavas I have had! I definitely recommend ordering the lavender icecream on the side- a perfect combination!  We have been doing this dinner+tree tradition for my birthday for 3 years now and this was my favorite dinner out of all three experiences!

(The first time I went into morimoto I almost turned back and walked right out because the interior screamed basic bitch to me.)If not for the fact that I had a big and late lunch, I would have gotten the $39.5 3 course pre theater menu. Instead, for $42, I got a 6oz (pre-sliced...) tuna steak, tablespoon of skordalia, some chard, and half a beet. Tuna was seared to a perfect rare but the dish needed more acid and less capers. The $12 ""seasonal"" fruit plate consists of an unskinned chunk of watermelon (it is winter right now), an uncut chunk of cantaloupe, 4 blueberries and 3 grapes. The actual desserts looked more exciting and I think may be Limani's strong suit. My dining companion decided that we share karipodita, a walnut sponge cake, which to me was among the less interesting options. Honey lavender ice cream that comes with the cake is a winner.

4.0,10/6/2015,"With a room as beautiful and modern as the gleaming, massive, blinding white dining area at Limani, it is best to understand what you are getting into.  The high design, high concept space, coupled with a Rock Center location, implies modern, experimental food.   Soups in beakers, deconstructed cake, exotic fruits frozen in liquid nitrogen and sealed in aspic that melts at room temperature, re-imagined caesar salad served in an erector set.  That kinda thing.But no, this is not a temple to modern cuisine.  In fact, it is a classic greek island fish specialist.  One that is going to have great, hard to find fish, cook them perfectly, plate them beautifully, and then drop a bill that will make you whimper silently for the next few weeks. If you have been to Milos in Midtown, or Mykonos, you will know the drill.  Get a cocktail, follow the waiter over to the iced fish table, choose from the 10-15 varieties of fish and shellfish, all sold by the pound, then choose some appetizers and let it rip.  In fact, the chef here was formerly the executive chef at Milos, so the similarities should be no surprise.That fish selection feels, to me, exactly like walking into the sports book at Caesar's Palace and betting on a game you don't follow, like Jai Alai, or third-tier MMA.  You look at those fish, priced from $45-$50 a pound, and try to guage whether that slimy little sucker is going to set you back $100 or $150, and whether or not choosing the smaller fish is going to mean a late night trip to Five Guys to top off before bed.  And then there are the Langoustines and Carabineros, two European varieties of prawn that run about $86 a pound - shell and head on.  If you love Langoustines, these will be good, and my wife and I split a Carabinero (they are very large) as part of our appetizers, which was served split and with a greek port wine for dipping.  It was lovely, but good golly that's a pricey shrimp.  We also selected Pink Snapper, greek name Fagri, for our main course.  It was truly fantastic, grilled perfectly and taken off the bone at the table, drizzled with olive oil and capers.  Getting unfamiliar fish is one of the joys of these places.  As much as I love Branzino and red snapper, why would you pay these prices for a fish you can easily get elsewhere?  We also tried the grilled mushroom appetizer (sliced oyster, shitake and king shrooms, cooked perfectly), the greek salad (nice, but priced for tourists at $24 and skimpy on the olives and feta), and an asparagus side ($12).I regret not trying the sashimi, a house speciality and unique offering, and the octopus, which I can only assume would be spectacular, both in flavor and cost.  We saw lovely towers of Kolokithi, fried zucchini, make their way through the tables.  These are a greek island staple, and I recommend trying them in the Cyclades where they are $5, and get there by saving up by not spending nearly $30 on the lovely version here.  Which leads to what I will call the Midtown Greek rule, which is:  If a dish is something you just can't imagine not ordering in a Greek restaurant, expect the price for that dish to be INSANE.  Saganaki, Kolokithi, Spanakopita, Greek Salad, Oregano fries, mixed dips - all will be great, but will deplete even the most aggressive expense account.With a $56 bottle of lovely Santorini wine, a round of cocktails, and no dessert, the total damage, for two, including tip, was $350. Now, that's not out of line for a high end midtown meal, especially not one in such a gorgeous room.  But here, like at Milos, you are paying for execution, not creativity.  You won't be getting a chemistry lesson while ordering; a caveman could explain the preparations:  baked in salt, steamed, cooked over charcoal (FIRE BAD!!!).  Your server won't launch into a Aeschalean monologue about the provenance of the sauces.  The fish will not come on a ""bed of"", it will come on a plate.  But it will be done *perfectly*.  The ingredients will be ultra fresh.  The service will be top notch.At least for dinner.  I can't speak for lunch.",7,3,1,Richard H.,"Westport, CT",85,120,1

The salmon was seasoned perfectly and was delicious.  The grilled lamb chop was done to perfection. My friend remarked the meat slid off like butter. My only qualm was the portions were a bit on the smaller side.  The walnut sponge cake, Karidopita with a side of honey lavender ice cream was delicious.

2.0,7/31/2015,"**SUMMER 2015 RESTAURANT WEEK REVIEW**A friend and I decided to try this place out for lunch during restaurant week on a Friday, at around 1, since it was just a block away from our offices. Good thing we made reservations on Open Table because the place looked pretty packed. I'm not sure if it was just because of restaurant week, but given it's location, I have a feeling it's always that busy. I'm not sure why though because their food isn't even that good. Again, I'm not sure if it was due to restaurant week - maybe their regular menu items are better, which I noticed that the RW menu items are not a part of. For the appetizer, I had the scallops with a citrus salad. The three scallops that it came with were good and I normally don't even like scallops that much but I decided to give this a try. They were fresh, and meaty. The ""salad"" that it came with was literally three small slices of mandarin oranges, and three slivers of purple onion. I'm not sure I would really consider that a salad. For the entree, I went with the lobster panini. It came with either really soggy fries, or super oily roasted potato wedges. Either way, they weren't good. The bread was just a hoagie that they charred on the outside. It wasn't even toasty or warm, like how paninis should be. There were very few pieces of lobster in there and the ones I did find were chewy. I would definitely not recommend this sammie. I should have stuck with my initial gut and went with the tuna burger. Finally, for dessert, I had the karidopita (walnut/cinnamon sponge cake with sweet syrup) with honey lavender ice cream. I'm not a fan of walnuts but all of the other dessert options seemed boring so I thought I would go with the most unique one. I actually ended up liking the cake! It's nutty and sweet. However, I didn't feel like the honey lavender complemented it very well. It tasted neither like honey nor lavender. Vanilla would have worked better, in my opinion. Service was SUPER slow.

Another disappointment was the entrees. I got the lamb which was average and my friend got the sea bass.

UMMM NOOOO... we haven't seen him and hadn't realized how much time had elapsed.  Right then, our paninis came.  We asked for them to go because we needed to leave ASAP.  They come back, drop the to-go bags, and rush off.. We had to track down ANOTHER waiter after 5 more minutes to ask him to get out check! WTF, we told u we needed to leave asap?!?!

5.0,7/21/2015,"**Restaurant Week Summer 2015 review**Between 4 and 5 stars all around from my group, thus, a 4.5 star review.  A solid lunch choice for Restaurant Week.Limani is a fairly new restaurant in the Rockefeller Plaza complex - it seemed like it took forever and a day to finally open.  I was happy to see it on the list of restaurants for this summer's RW, as I've always walked by and seen the beautiful interior.The inside of this restaurant is no joke.  It's super modern, sleek, and clean - lots of white leather and marble with beachy, nautical notes around.  In the middle is a large sort of reflection pool.  My party sat next to it and I've got to say, it feels super fancy.For starters, I got the scallops with citrus salad, which is really just 3-4 wedges of orange and red onion with 2 small scallops.  Though small in size and quantity, one of my colleagues and I agreed that the scallops were seasoned and seared to perfection.  Not overcooked, but cooked just enough.  No gamey ocean taste, either.  The scallops were very fresh.  I also tried my other colleague's Meze plate - they offer zucchini chips (I think that's what it was?), but it comes with some of the most delicious warm, fresh pita I've had.  Theres 4 different dips including tzatziki (yum) and hummus (yum), but I don't remember the other two.  Also comes with what looks like spanakopita and a stuffed grape leave.  Solid choice for appetizer if you're into trying a sampling of their dips and antipasti.All of us ordered the fish of the day, which was a massive fillet of Loup de Mer (Bronzini) that seems to be pan seared/roasted.  The fish was extremely fresh, huge in quantity, and well seasoned with capers and lemon.  I loved the skin - it was crispy and flavorful.  The flesh of the was cooked quite well, though teetering on the edge of cooked too long.  I still can't get over how big a fillet we each got.For dessert, we all got the honey and lavender ice cream with honey walnut cake.  Wow, the honey lavender ice cream was delicious.  Better than the honey lavender ice cream I've had at specialty ice cream shops.  I'm not sure if they make this in-house, but I would definitely buy a pint.  The walnut cake was a little too sweet and overshadowed by the delicious ice cream.Overall, lovely atmosphere and interior and great restaurant week selection for midtown lunchers.",8,2,4,Allene T.,"Manhattan, NY",2170,1311,3573

Little pool in the center of a white and blue room.  Like a trip to the Greek isles.  Even if the food were not outstanding, I would have been happy, but that did not disappoint either.  Started with an excellent and flavorful Mediterranean Fish Soup followed by the well-prepared Loup de Mer.  For dessert, I had the Karidopita with honey lavender ice cream. The place is perfect for a business lunch, a date or just a lunch or dinner on the town.Service was professional and friendly. The $26.95 prix fixe for lunch is great value.  There is also a $46.50 Pre/Post Theater prix fixe. If the prix fixe price were much higher I might have lowered the rating to 4 (although 4 1/2 would be correct), but given the excellent value, the stunning decor and great food, it deserves a five.",0,0,0,Randall S.,"Manhattan, NY",837,109,13

3.0,5/27/2015,"KenScale: 7.5/10Limani is a Greek restaurant around Rockefeller Center, a branch of its original location in Roslyn, NY. I haven't had much experience with Greek food before, but since I've always been a fan of fresh seafood that Greek cuisine is well-known for, I made a visit recently. Limani's food wasn't that bad, but it made me think again about the proper balance of flavor that is important to making great seafood dishes. I started out with a dish called saganki (pan fried cheese) that was a nice bite to start off your meal. Next came various seafood dishes. While the seafood at Limani was generally fresh and well-cooked, I was expecting a little more modest seasoning that could enhance rather than underwhelm the texture of fish. Grilled octopus was nicely cooked, but it could've used less salt for sure. Scallops grilled on the skewer with bell peppers and onions were more successful in flavor, but this time they could've been cooked a little more tender. The restaurant has a variety of whole fish options, so I went with the dover sole. It was nicely cooked with better balance of flavor and texture, but honestly I was expecting more out of it. There was that wow factor missing from it that I couldn't quite pinpoint, but I guess I have higher expectations of whole dish dishes with expensive price point ($60 for the dover sole). The meal did end on a sound note, however, as I loved the simple Greek yogurt that came with thyme honey and walnuts. Even though I was beyond stuffed by the time the dessert arrived, I still nearly finished it. Loved that silky smooth texture with modest level of sweetness.The restaurant has a fancy dining area that is well-suited for work crowd during happy hours as well as the tourists. Located at Rockefeller Center means that it has more corporate and touristy feel to the place than I would've liked. Getting a reservation isn't very challenging, and there is full bar (I would go with white wine to go along with seafood). I'm not sure what to make of Limani: there are some fresh seafood, but does it show the clean taste of Greek cuisine? Perhaps due to its location, it feels more like some corporate crowd favorite place that happens to have Greek food than authentic Greek seafood palace.",2,0,0,Ken S.,"Manhattan, NY",512,612,4738

1.0,4/22/2015,"Unbelievable. That in a nutshell sums up my experience at Limani. We were a party of 8 and were eager to dine here since they opened its doors. The restaurant is beautifully decorated and the ambiance was great. The food was fresh and tastefully prepared with drinks just as delicious and overall, a great option for a special occasion. With all of that being said, it would've been easy enough for me to give Limani a higher rating but the evening didn't end quite so well when it came time to settle the bill. After a nice evening of great drinks (try the riesling & the 'tini) & good eats (highlights were the octopus,  shrimp saganaki & the lobster and the donuts for dessert), we settled the bill only to then realize that we were over-charged for 4 items! It was my fault for only giving the bill a quick review before forking over payment, but a good thing I reviewed it carefully afterwards since we were mis-charged for an appetizer, a side and two drinks! When brought to the attention of our server, he rolled his eyes and addressed these charges. He later apologized for the mishap and comped us two drinks, which we later realized it was actually only one when the day after we noticed that the bill itself didn't add up properly and we were over-charged by $10!  I get that these things happen from time to time but was appalled that there were multiple mischarges & the fact that the bill didn't sum up properly really put it over the edge! How can the bill not add up correctly? Things happen but it's how it's handled that really makes the difference and in this case, I was absolutely appalled. Be forewarned and pay close attention to the charges on your bill when dining here. There's definitely good eats to be had here so I'd say it's 3-4 stars in terms of food but given the horrible experience, I just can't get myself to give this place more than 1 star. No one should ever have a headache or feel disgusted by the service after dining at an 'upscale' restaurant like this one.

Our server was friendly and our food came out quickly.Food: The set lunch menu is overall great:-- Avocado salad with baby shrimp - beautiful presentation, although one of the shrimp were not cleaned properly, which was disappointing in a restaurant of this caliber. -- Crab cake - my husband ordered this and it was great. Not sure it's worth an $8 supplement but I'm glad we tried it.-- Organic salmon with steamed vegetables - this wasn't the best salmon I've ever had...it was a bit undercooked, despite my request to have it cooked well done. It was tasty but nothing special.-- Chicken kebab - I don't eat chicken so I can't comment, but my husband seemed to like it.-- Seasonal fresh fruit - we both ordered this as our dessert (because we are utterly boring). The fruit was beautifully presented, however, a few of my grapes were inedible. Not a big deal but something to note.The Bottom Line: I do think that the restaurant has a few kinks to work out (dirty water glass, shrimp could be cleaned better, fruit should be checked) before it deserves 5 stars, but I definitely plan on returning!",2,1,1,Ameena D.,"New York, NY",93,458,0

We decided to make reservations here for my cousins birthday and we definitely felt welcomed. The atmosphere is beautiful and the staff is great. They sat us down next to the water piece in the middle. It's like a mini pool and uv lighting. The server introduced herself and then the waiter came and introduced hisself (FYI they do the same thing in Long Island). He asked us if it was our first time here then gave us a mini tour which made our reservation more beautiful. The drinks are pretty good. One glass of champagne is expensive, if it's enough of you guys order a bottle. Although the waiter recommended a fish that he said is a popular one 3 of us played it safe and just ordered steak while my sister ordered salmon. The steak was delicious we got it med rare and it was so tender..! The dessert was delicious also. I got the lemon sorbet. This is definitely a nice hot new place and I forgot to mention it just opened up. It is pricey but it's worth it.

Fresh Mediterranean food - so fresh, it involves a tour of the whole fish and shell fish on ice set near the open kitchen.  The sushi grade grilled octopus was so tender and beautifully prepared.  We shared a whole fish to share after we got our tour and descriptions of what was available and how it was prepared.  The grilled vegetable side was a perfect accompaniment to the simply grilled fish with olive oil and spices.  We also had the Greek fries which are best eaten right when it's served because it gets wilted quite quickly.
