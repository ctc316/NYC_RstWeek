4.0,4/24/2019,"Food is good - ( a little overpriced )Ambiance-  reminded me of a European cafe which is cute but this one is stuffy, if you are lunching alone you'll feel the coldness of fellow patrons and staff, good luck. Service experience: It would have been nice to be able to finiSH! it but the server came and before I could say I'm not done he took it, I didn't want to yank my dish from his hands or seem desperate since  the tables next to me where so close ~ so I let it gooo ugh!Observations: They rush you during lunch hour it seems, especially if you're alone; the 2 ladies next to me where there before me and stayed forever and no one rushed to take their dish away.

4.0,4/3/2019,"I love desserts and I love European cafes, so this place is like heaven on earth for me. My only gripe is that it is super pricey. $7.50 for a cup of coffee is aggressive. But if you are looking to treat yourself check this place out.There is a coffee bar in the front where you can just grab a drink and stand, and then there are seats around the restaurant. My boyfriend and I shared tiramisu, hazelnut cake, and the assorted cookies. The tiramisu was really good, it had a lot of lady fingers in it which I like. I'd say the portions were your standard dessert size: big enough if you wanted to share but you could probably have one on your own too. They also have amazing cookies, so even if you just want to grab a box to take home at the counter you should!",1,0,0,Aiko S.,"Bronx, NY",275,50,15

5.0,1/18/2019,"One of the hottest brunch tickets for Sunday Brunch is Sant Ambroeus. Myself & four other Ladies Who Brunch, delighted in conversations over brunch, a few laughs, and deliciousness.   From The Cafe to the actual dinning room, SA is bustling in a contiguous feeling of family, and all over good times. It's like the ultimate coming together over food, that I find myself lost for the actual words to describe. It is an ambience one most experience for thyself. The staff is wonderful, polite, and smiling faces. Most of all they are helpful, and the dining experience is not rushed. In regards to food, everything is simply delicious.  The desserts are a delight & picture perfect.  Just think of a glamorously, Fabulous, family brunch setting.  Our table enjoyed every moment of our brunch from the Bellini's to Tartare di Tonno.

5.0,1/3/2019,"When I asked ""someone"" to please find me a cafe for a small light lunch on the WEST SIDE and he steers me here because it was ""nearby the Met"", it took me a while to accept it and not be mad.I would not have selected this place to take my son for lunch.  And I would have preferred being a little more hungry than I actually was if I knew we were having lunch here.  All I was looking for was a small salad (not at all the $29 burrata kale salad I did have) and a good cup of coffee (""good"" is an understatement and but had I been in a better frame of mind, I would have ordered an affogato instead).  I was not looking for fancy- I was already pushing a little boy's patience dragging him to the Met.  In the end it was lovely lunch and everyone was very happy with their meal.They were extraordinarily polite and sweet to my little boy.  Even though we did not have a reservation, they did have a quiet table available.  It was next to the kitchen, but honestly that was the best place to put us with the little one.  The 5 stars are for the hot chocolate and the hazelnut chocolate cake.  I wish I was actually really hungry so I could just have a slice all to myself.  And maybe some of that gelato in the case across from the barista too.",0,1,0,Karen Y.,"Boston, MA",134,559,1

Creamy and boring.  The bolognese sauce was good but served over a small portion of fettuccine.  The small mixed green salads was the best part of the meal.  I have never had a smaller cup of espresso anywhere.  This place is very, very expensive and most def not worth it.  Save your money and choose one of the other real Italian spots in the city!!",1,0,0,maria A.,"Diablo, CA",1,36,0
5.0,12/14/2018,My favorite espresso and cookies. Great place to go for a snack late in the day. Wonderful soups. The minestrone is so flavorful you will think that you are in a trattoria in Italy. Also all the vegetarian soups are very tasty. The sunflower seed bread is also so good. I often run in and take out the small tuna and tomato sandwiches on brioche. They also have turkey with mozzarella. It's a wonderful quick lunch when you are on the go. The dinner is expensive but occasionally worth the splurge.,0,0,0,Robin G.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,5,0

When we arrived, we were met with a pompous manager who said that the place is booked until 3:30. We explained that we called in advance and he simply answered in a defensive tone by saying "" I don't believe you, I trained my staff well"".  We were shocked at the manager demeanor and left the establishment never to go back!

The place is vibrant, the service is friendly... so why, you ask, is this a three star review?The food is not what I remember.

3.0,8/20/2018,I was in the neighborhood so decided to stop by Sant Ambroeus since the Met Rooftop was closed due to rain. The food was overall decent although not memorable. The same can be said about the service. Everything was just OK. The one great ting is the carrot ginger soup which was made perfectly. I also enjoyed the sweet potato fries and noted that the roasted potatoes looked good as well (I didn't try them but saw them on someone's plate). Wine selection was good but I wasn't impressed with the pasta dishes or the chicken. On the expensive side for my taste.,3,0,1,Tamara H.,"Manhattan, NY",130,365,411

Perhaps, our server was paying more attention to a C-rate celebrity she thought would give her a gangbuster tip, but she certainly was nowhere to be found during our entire meal. Reluctantly had to Ask for condiments from the bartender (the only other restaurant employee in sight) and he had a condsending attitude about it.

All of their balsamic, olive oil, wine (and I'm sure more) is house label stuff and more than once we have walked away wishing we had picked up a bottle or two to take home (but always can't due to luggage restrictions oh well).

5.0,5/23/2018,"Spectacular restaurant and semi-separate cafeMy wife and I enjoyed a truly spectacular lunch here recently after seeing the new costume exhibit at the Met. Everything was spot on - the drinks, the food, and the service. However, be forewarned that space actually houses two semi-separate eateries - the restaurant in the back and the cafe in front.We started with a pair of cocktails - the Solero and the Green Light - which were both wonderful. Then the bread service arrived with a selection that ranged from a soft white to a hearty olive loaf. We split a cold spring pea soup that was scrumptious and rather enormous - even our 'split' portions were more than adequate. We then moved on to the Lasagna Verde and Ravioli al Prosciutto which were again spectacular and quite large. To my surprise only the pasta and not the ragu was green - while it was delicious it was not the Genoese dish I was expecting. We finished off with a slice of Millefoglie and espresso - both delicious...though not quite so massive.The service was attentive, polite, and professional with perfect pacing for our semi-celebratory meal. And the decor was that of a nice European restaurant with good lighting and plenty of wood paneling.The elephant in the dining room is the price (particularly for lunch). After tip our meal ended up to be a bit over $100 per person. But it was a truly spectacular experience and I found myself quite jealous of the older diners who were obviously frequent patrons.

I'm not a huge fan of either mozzarella or prosciutto just by themselves, so for me this was okay.For entrees Ralph got one pasta and I got the Ravioli di Prosciutto one (prosciutto-filled ravioli with rucola salad, burrata and tomato confit).

They have sandwiches, cookies, chocolates, ice cream, coffee, tea, etc. All super fresh and delicious. You can get your coffee with almond milk, which I like. At the far end of the restaurant, they have normal standard restaurant seating for lunch and dinner. The food at this place is amazing. The pastas, the salads, everything.

The overall ambiance is...old money and crowded. We were there on a Sat afternoon, and the place was absolutely packed and I couldn't even go from the door to the seat without being physically stopped 4-5 times. I tried a bite of the fish dish from the pre-fix menu and it was ok, kinda bland. I did enjoy the tiramisu quite a bit, and but was a little bit annoyed when the staff asked me repeatedly to choose something on the pre-fix menu, which I didn't even know why they were so pressed to prevent me from trying their flagship dessert item.Overall, this place was ok, maybe above average if you're into that kinda of ambiance, but for me, it's too rich and generic for my blood.",4,3,2,Xiao Z.,"Philadelphia, PA",356,1086,1601
2.0,10/22/2017,Tired very tired. I have been to Sant Ambroeus many times before and this past Friday was a disappointment for sure. My salad was tasteless and the veal scallopini was dreadful -alternating between bland and burnt. Our server never came over to inquire about our meal until the end. When he finally did ask and I was honest he said you should have said something earlier -uhm I would have if you had come anywhere near our table.

We get into realize that it is one fancy fancy FANCY place. Definitely way out of my med student budget fancy. There was a Maître d'hotel in a suit! I was worried that since it was such an elegant place the waiters would be snooty and judge us for only ordering one item. However, we were pleasantly surprised by how genuinely kind and accommodating the entire waitstaff were. We ordered Carpaccio di Filetto to share and had THE MOST DELICIOUS sunflower bread on the planet. I've always liked bread but I never knew it could be that amazing. I also didn't know sunflower bread even existed before this. I've been so deprived! I cannot wait to come back here one day as full fledged doctor try more of their foods and be pampered by the fantastic waitstaff again. We also grabbed some gelato on the way out. Our waiter was kind enough to point out while handing us our dark chocolate and bill that it would be cheaper to order gelato to go than to eat it in the restaurant.

They have a tendency to forget, although they are all very nice and sweet people. Ambiance is quite cute inside, they have nice decor and the seating feels very nice and intimate. Food is honestly kind of average for the price point too. Pasta dishes start at around $26 and most portion sizes are pretty decent. We got the spaghetti pomodoro, tagliatelle with truffle and prosciutto ravioli. The prosciutto ravioli is the only dish that has meat in it and the only dish I would recommend.

4.0,1/8/2017,"4 Star cookies, $$$ price and less than A-Ok service: My mom has always treated herself to cookies from this place, ever since I was a little kid (for about 30 years now). The cookies always come all wrapped up on a little golden (paper) tray because ""they're soooooo fan-cy"" (sang in Iggy Azalea voice). My mom would always have to hide the tray in her book bag (mom bag) to preserve the cookies from being inhaled by me and my three siblings. She would carefully parse them out. So, yeah we go way back with this place. One thing  you should know about the Sant Ambroeus cookie counter is that it is ""VERY LOUD AND CLEAR"" an upscale patisserie type of place. The cookies are very classic and heavy with the (ALMIGHTY) butter. They are delicious but the price tag is semi-steep and atmosphere can be bit oppressive because of the noticeable ""putting on of airs.""Anyway, with that said, I am giving them 4 stars because of the quality of the cookies ALONE. but I would be too lazy to write a review just based on delicious, 4 star cookies. No, the REAL REASON why I am writing this review is because of the off-putting interaction, or complete lack thereof with the cookie server. The woman who served us the cookies (on Saturday, 1-7-17) was remarkably sullen and she served the cookies in the most perfunctory way imaginable, not a word exchanged (not even a ""hello"" or ""ok""). Nope, she was completely terse (except for the fact that she was angrily conversing with her co-worker, in Spanish the whole time).  She never smiled. And when we asked questions about the parcels, she said nothing (but we knew she could understand us because she DID do what was requested). Anyway, I felt compelled to yelp this because when you go to a place that charges $30 for cookies, it would be nice to have it accompanied with a civil (maybe even friendly?) human interaction.",0,0,1,Jane K.,"New York, NY",12,37,0

It demands respect precisely because of its opaqueness. The seasonal Panettone: one of the best in NYC, and this from a person who believes that olive oils and fish are two products where higher price levels rarely reflect greater quality.  (Why exactly is whiting disdained?)

Restrooms were disgusting.There was toilet paper on the toilet boil. Towels' distributor was out of order and the tissue box was empty too.Some used towels were laying close to the sink ...once again, you expect more cleanliness, you could tell that nobody comes regularly to check if everything is okay in the restroom.At least food is very good and it deserves to be tried but for the service, it's more like a French place ...rude and a little bit despising :(",4,2,0,Liv A.,"New York, NY",61,13,11

A different couple (also, a party of two) came in, started talking to the hostess in Spanish, the hostess starts chatting (starting to get very excited) and lets them into a cafe area (by the window). Other people who came after us were taken to the restaurant area by another hostess, and so I asked her, ""why are they being seated before us?"" She rolls her eyes, and tells me, ""that area is for people who have reservations, you can go inside check with him yourself"". 1. If the cafe area is for people who are walking-in, why was that couple seated before us? 2. No people whom I was referring to did not have reservations.

His was delicious with cocoa powder on top. My coffee was indeed a pot of coffee. It didn't look that big but filled my coffee cup 4 times! I figured that the coffee was on par with other places. Coffee is freshly roasted and delicious. Just what I needed!We sat at one of the small tables in the front. The back section was larger and away from the take out area but didn't have windows.

1.0,3/15/2015,"Dining at this restaurant has inspired me to write my first ever Yelp review.I live on the Upper East Side and dine out between 4-5 times per week. I have also worked in hospitality in NYC for the past 7 years. I'm leaving Sant Ambroeus one star because I had the displeasure of getting some of the worst service I've ever experienced at a New York City restaurant. I frequently pass Sant Ambroeus while shopping on Madison and was looking forward to dining during their teatime. My boyfriend and I stopped in at about 4 P.M on a weekday and the restaurant was understandably only occupied by several other parties at this time.We each ordered a drink (bellini & a glass of prosecco) and an entree. Our entrees were delivered fairly promptly but unfortunately our drinks had still not arrived. Seeing as our drinks were fairly simple to prepare and the restaurant was nearly empty I found it incredibly odd that our entrees arrived ahead of our drinks. Even odder was the large amount of wait staff and two managers in suit & tie who were milling around the dining room paying no mind to us. About halfway through our entrees my bellini finally arrived. We were told it was going to be another few minutes for the champagne. (I'm assuming they had to open a new bottle but if this was the case they should have told us) The champagne finally did arrive nearly 35 mins after ordering it and near the end of our meal. It was delivered with no apology or explanation as to why it took so long. No one ever checked in on us to ask how our meal was or if we needed anything (we would have like pepper) or if we wanted another drink or to order anything more (we did).As we finished our entrees (which by the way were the only good part of this experience)  I attempted to make eye contact with any one of the numerous servers or managers wandering about glancing carelessly at their phones but not a single one took notice. Our original server had completely disappeared. Finally a bus boy stopped to grab our empty dishes at which point I asked if I could please see our server. 15 mins pass and no server. I decided to stop another bus boy and instead ask to see a menu figuring maybe if I have a menu someone will realize we would like to order more. 15 more mins pass and no menu, no server.Finally I flagged down a manager and asked for the check. I told him I was upset we had been waiting so long. He had zero response to this. At any point during our meal, a staff member could have made this better. Unfortunately the staff and management here have zero communication skills and zero hospitality knowledge. We were clearly upset at the end of our meal yet the manager refused to acknowledge this.

2.0,2/9/2015,"Several years ago (maybe 10) I read an article about best cappuccino in NYC. Sant Amboreus was mentioned as one of the best. So I decided to try it and it was in fact very good. I happened to be in Manhattan recently and had a cappuccino there again. It was at best average. Considering the price -$7 (my girlfriend had tea for $7) it was bordering on offensive. Fortunately there are many places in NY, as well as Boston and San Francisco nowadays where you can get a fantastic cappuccino for much less. I would also add that I make a much better one at home with Rancilio Silvia at home with Italian roasted beans.

4.0,2/4/2015,"a ok elegant place with classy decor and excellent on point service. i came for breakfast with my sister , who has been here a bunch of time , but my first time. overall breakfast was decent, however cappuccino was great, some of the best i have ever tasted on a long time.the egg omelette was a little on the bland side, but no big deal, will be back to try lunch or dinner. very good service from staff and place looks nice.its has a euro decor of old, but not outdated, and the chandeliers are a nice touch in this small but not cramped restaurant. i had some gelato to go and was still hard, not mushy when i got to work, very tasty.the prices are kinda borderline prices, but not crazy. our server stated many out of towners hotel guest come here. now i know why it was crowded with some italian and french speaking folks. my next visit will be for dessert, more gelato and a pasta dish or two.overall a solid 4 stars.",3,1,3,Sadri B.,"White Plains, NY",5000,2398,480

The place is quite expensive but you are paying for the atmosphere. Coffee will cost you greater than $7 a cup and tea probably a dollar less for hot water and leaves. Saw half a grapefruit for $7!

5.0,8/11/2014,"Totally forgot about the name of this place until I stepped into it again (1 year later haha)!This has got to be one of my favorite gelato places - fairly authentic to the italian taste of gelato. Flavors are exceptionally accurate and fully capture whatever flavor (whether mango, blood orange, chocolate, coffee, pistachio, hazelnut, etc).Usually mango is my favorite flavor, but I came from a full 3-course lunch and had two fruit-based desserts, so I was looking for a creamier flavor. This time I went for two scoops of coffee (think: espresso flavor WITHOUT the bitterness). For a person who hates bitter coffee, Sant Ambroeus definitely showed its skill in bringing a coffee-like flavor in a yummy dessert-tasting way.If you're in the UES, don't miss stopping by :)",2,1,1,Christina Z.,"New York, NY",983,378,398

Pair one up with a latte and your day couldn't be off to a better start!!!The space itself is nothing amazing by NY standards, a little small and cramped, but very well run and has a great atmosphere.  It is also very expensive, especially for dinner, but if you are looking for some of the best food on the UES  look no further.",3,0,0,Tony P.,"San Francisco, CA",11,6,0

5.0,5/31/2014,"Hey! This is my first review and I am honored to start it off with this spectacular establishment. Well where do I start, how about... WOW!! GO THERE!!!This review will be on my two visits to this restaurant, and the reason I decided to get on yelp. So lets begin...When I was invited to dine here, I completely had no clue this place would be this good. At first glance online, the only thing that caught my eye was that this was a cafe that specializes in desert, but let me tell you my friends, It is much more than expected. Absolutely beautiful restaurant with excellent service, and trust me I know service. When first walking in, you enter to a small bar with bartender on the front end and a barista on the other. On the opposite side was a large glass fridge display with a nice selection of gelato and delicate little deserts. When walking past all that, we entered the larger dining area and were immediately greeted by the Matre'd and the lovely hostess. Dining room was very classy and clean, not very noise and had a great ambiance. The wait staff seemed very knowledgeable, persistent and professional. Most of them even spoke Italian. The menu is indeed on the expensive side, with most appetizers starting in the $20 range. I ordered a special appetizer on my first visit which was a cold sushi like fish plate with caviar and ginger if not mistaken. Portions was not very large, but it was packed with delicious flavor with every savory bite. I ordered the Lasagna verde as my main entree as I was not extremely hungry but also did not want to leave hungry. Might I say, it was absolutely delicious. The plating was clean and beautifully presented. Portion of the lasagna was just right and was packed with flavor. Meanwhile, the staff was always checking up and did work swiftly. I absolutely loved the experience and wanted to come back. And so i did.On the next visit, I got to try some different Dishes. I started with the Vitello Tonnato, which is thinly sliced veal with a tuna mousse topping it. Plated beautifully, the veal was superb and the dish was overall refreshing. My main entree however, I wasn't very pleased with. It was quite funny, because as an old server, if i didn't like something on the menu, I tried to steer the customer away from it. My server attempted something very similar by recommend an entirely different dish, but I chose to stick with the one I initially picked, which was the Ravioli stuffed with braised short ribs. Needless to say, the plating looked great and mouth watering. It gave off an aroma of fresh sage (which I love) and of cheese. The ravioli had nice thickness of the dough and were cooked slightly Al-Dente. The stuffing could have been better. My only disappointment was that it was on the overly salty side for my taste buds. Oh well, Now came the dessert.. and Boy!! was it good. I had the hazelnut Gelato... ummm.. It took me to heaven, let me high five and angel, and brought me back with every bite. They have a chocolate covered desert that has that same gelato inside, so I highly recommend you ask your server about it. While Im on the subject of deserts, all of their pastries looked really incredible, Will be back to try them all.This place deserves a 4.8/5 Stars...A Must Visit and a Must Try!!! You wont be disappointed.Oh and I forgot to add... When you ask for cheese, They come by your table a grate fresh cheese into your plate by hand. I was very impressed by that idea. I can't say I was ever a fan of dry, slate parmesan cheese thats added a hard and rubbery texture to your dish. Keep up the good work!!!!",2,1,2,Michael K.,"Naples, FL",160,155,252

We were in and out of the place in under 5 minutes. Everything was packaged nicely and travelled across Manhattan well. I could tell that they put some serious thought into it. Now onto the desserts - they were all mouthwatering... Nocciola - I could eat 10 of these! Hazelnut butter cream & salted almonds - need I say more?Millesfoglie - imagine a better version of the traditional éclairs.Crostata di Mele -  apple tart with an awesome shortbread crust.Profiterol - sponge cake that tastes like espresso, chocolate and pistachio.Sfogliatina di Frutta di Stagione - an ordinary fruit tart that happened to be very delicious.

I forgot what cocktail I had but it was orange and it was good... cake wise... It was chocolate with apricot filling inside and every bit was to die for ... literally. The sis ordered a bottle of wine but since I was already tipsy from the cocktail, I had no idea what it was but it was white and I drank it and it was refreshing!Perfect birthday dinner... perfect way to end my NYC trip...

5.0,5/13/2013,"Well, this place blew me away. A traditional looking italian restaurant, with food that delights your senses.When we first arrived, we noticed that the restaurant had a small seating area by the entrance, similar to a cafe, and a more private, elegant, large seating area in the back. Luckily, we were seated in the back. As expected from Manhattan, table were located closed to one another, allowing you to listen to your neighbor's conversations, if you chose to do so.The private room had a large crystal chandelier hanging from the top, with dim lighting and a very romantic feel to it. When our waiter arrived, he seemed ill mattered and rude. He was abrupt when adding glasses to our table, or removing them. But he warmed up after a few minutes and his tone completely changed. I'm not sure what it is, but maybe it was part of his original Sicilian personality. I ordered the Vegetarian Lasagna with eggplant. It blew me away. It was beyond delicious and cooked to perfection.  The dish was very rich, the eggplant was perfectly soft, with just right amount of Mozzarella.My friend ordered the Saffron Risotto. That too, as delicious but too rich for either one of us. She was only able to eat 1/4 of it. We finished the evening with a hazelnut dessert. It was the most delicious desert I have had recently. It tasted like fresh Nutella, but home made.The wait staff was very attentive to our needs. The crowd seemed local-very upper east side Manhattan. It is a very romantic location and ideal for a date.",1,0,0,ShopperLA D.,"Los Angeles, CA",25,156,27
2.0,4/23/2013,"Ya, I've reviewed Sant Ambroeus before. Yes, my reviews were predominantly negative. Why then would I ever return? Well, when you live a block away from a joint, sometimes you find yourself there even if you know what you're in for. In my case, I get dragged there by other locals who don't want to walk more than a block, or unknowing out-of-towners who liked the coffee thus assume the food is acceptable. I'm not going to rehash in detail the flaws of this place. I will, however, rescind a previous exception I offered to the mediocrity of this place from a previous review by saying that my compliment of the saffron risotto was misplace - it should have read ""they got the saffron risotto right...once, but the next time, even the manager was stunned by the mess that came out of the kitchen and offered, sheepishly, to replace it"". For this review, I am going to make it real simple. I took a photo. I ordered an omelette. I don't like my omelette runny. So my exact order, verbatim, was ""an omelette, please, mushroom and cheddar, cooked through."" The photo (I believe you will have to go above and scroll through the photos to find it) is of the omelette delivered. When I pointed out to the waiter that the omelette was burnt to a crisp, he said ""that's what you ordered...well done!""  Of course, I told him I asked for it cooked through, not well done, and that well done is not the same as burnt anyway...but to no avail. So included is the image of my twenty-some-odd-dollar omelette.  Enough said.....",3,3,1,Jeff M.,"Manhattan, NY",4,37,25

It's just such an odd mark-up, particular to the area, that I've never seen elsewhere.

Sant Ambroeus was without a doubt the best decision of a great day. This is the kind of place where you expect the essence New York to be, the one of the most iconic movies of New York.

For me, it's a neighborhood spot that's both classy but relaxed.I recently had dinner there and both the appetizers and the main courses were really well prepared. Simple, clean and timeless. I had the salmon with lentils and fennel and I have no idea how they made it so flavorful. Date had the lamb and said it was delicious. We shared an apricot tart for dessert and it was also perfect. I feel like the back dining room evokes both Europe and classic New York. The dining room is both old-school and contemporary, with a gigantic chandelier overhead. It actually feels quite cozy and the staff never rushes you-- perfect for a date or dinner with friends. It's funny, I've read a few of the poor reviews on here and noticed that most whine about the hefty prices, but honestly, it's ridiculous to go to a high-end restaurant in this area and expect the pricing to be on the lower end of the spectrum-- you're also paying for location.

4.0,2/4/2013,"TL;DR - Classic Italian espresso bar with terrific espresso and great pastries / sandwiches, but Madison Avenue prices. Passable service, I expected better. Did not sample the entrees, but you might like the sister Felice restaurants better in that regard, simply based on primary focus and decor. I did not sample the gelato, rumor says it's good.I don't think we're long for this neighborhood, and I would have regretted it if I hadn't strolled over to Sant Ambroeus before we moved. And so, this morning, I did.By the decor, the people speaking Italian, and the stand-up bar, I was immediately taken back to my trip to Rome. I love Italian stand-up espresso bars - walk in, grab an espresso, walk out. I suppose you can do that at any Starbucks at well, except Starbucks espresso is to Sant Ambroeus espresso the way the Gowanus canal is to a mountain stream.That, and the fact that a macchiato in Starbucks is some caramel thing (I still don't get that). Granted - I like my Starbucks, but I don't pretend that a Starbucks is the same as an Italian espresso bar.The service at the bar was passable. I ordered a macchiato, and was told to get pastries from the counter opposite the bar. Got my pastries in a to-go bag (girl didn't ask), and there was some back-and-forth confusion between the counter girl and the bar guy about the macchiato. If there's a correct way to order a cornetto and macchiato at the bar, it's not clear, and I didn't do it. After all, having returned to the bar, I had to ask for my macchiato, it appeared that the bar guy forgot. He did, however, give me a glass of water, and a plate for my cornetto.I liked the Italian newspapers - it's clear that Italian expats come here, and so therefore, the espresso must be good. It is.

Not the best I have had, but it was just perfect in that that moment. We also ordered a whiskey, neat, each. I'm glad we opted for the whiskey instead of dessert wine as the wine would have been too sweet. If that's your thing, though, they have a couple of ports that would pair nicely with their desserts.

2.0,1/6/2013,"I would give this five stars as a coffee/dessert place and one star as a lunch/dinner place. Lets start with the dessert- it was exceptional. Had this hazelnut mousse thing and a pistachio/espresso profiterole. They were incredible and reasonably priced I would argue. I have not had a dessert that good in a long time. Now, as for the rest of the place:They have waay to many staff and way too few minimally intelligent staff. The many waiters and waitresses we had were rude, dense, and unable to communicate. They don't need a 3:1 customer:waiter ratio, but they do need to make sure the staff is paying attention, knows the menu, and has some kind of personality. They literally have heads like a rock (all of them)- go there and you will know exactly what I mean. The food is mediocre to moderately good depending on what you order. The octopus was pretty good, but the halibut and pastas were very weak. The prices are ridiculous for what you are getting. If you want to go there just to be a part of the ""scene"" or whatever is motivating you (certainly not the food), then just go for coffee or dessert (which is legitimately great).

Pastas, salads, paini's, risottos, and sandwiches. I opted for the Saffron risotto while my friend had the Baratta and Grilled Vegetable Salad. Both were well seasoned and delicious.

I was there last night and although the food is very good and the service is impeccable, the atmosphere is meh and there are much better restaurants that don't charge as much as this place. My date is a regular so we did get special treatment, the fact that he's fluent in Italian helps and a lot of the staff recognized him from the Southampton locale. We were seated at a primo booth at around 8 on a Tuesday night. To start they offer you a choice of 3 different breads. I chose the sunflower seed and it was great.

It's truffle season!!! My date decided to go with the filet served with mashed potatoes and vegetables with white truffles shaved on top and I went with the pasta special. Homemade large rigatoni type noodles with lobster and green pea puree. My dish was heavenly! My dates steak was perfectly cooked but the whole truffle thing eludes me. His dish was $150. Really?? I have no idea what my pasta dish cost but I'm sure it was up there. Was it worth $400 for 2 people? Although REALLY good, I'm thinking not on that one.

We decided to try the food and it was horrible, the octopus appetizer had dry, overcooked octopus, the vegetables were overcooked and tasteless, the salads had dry tasteless toppings, oily bottoms and were very bland overall.  For $20+ per appetizer and $40+ per main, this is unacceptable. The soy lattes and regular lattes were absolutely amazing - in my opinion, for a nice UES restaurant, they are worth the $6-8 per cup.  There's nothing exactly like this unless we walk east and even then getting such a great SOY latte would be tough. The desserts were also really good.  For $10 per little dessert and per gelato order, you better be ready for the price, but the flavors were great.  I ended up stealing gelato from my 4 year old daughter (and that's AFTER finishing my dessert). Service was ok, obviously this place is NOT happy that people are only coming here for desserts and even though we ordered food, they were not thrilled that we didn't do a full 3 courses for everyone and didn't get alcoholic drinks.  Not sure what will happen if everyone starts coming here for desserts only, will they still seat you and will you have a good experience?  Not guaranteed.",2,0,0,Alice G.,"Glen Rock, NJ",3,47,0

So instead, mom and sis ordered their cappuccinos and I had a cup of tea and we took a shot at the brunch menu. I had the omelette della casa, which is nothing very exciting. The omelette was on the dry side and the sides (roasted potatoes, fresh cherry tomatoes and frisee) were almost tastier. Mom had the foccacino which she seemed to enjoy.

1.0,10/2/2011,"Amateur Night on the Upper East SideWe took NY Times food critic, Sam Sifton, at his word, namely, where to find at plate of pasta in the mid-$20 range.  We made a reservation at Sant Ambroeus before we arrived in New York from San Francisco.  The comedy of errors began the moment we arrived.  My wife had telephoned several days before to make the reservation.  The hostess could not find it on the computer.  I took a look.  They person who took the reservation had seriously misspelled our name even though my wife had spelled it out when she made the reservation.As we entered the relatively small dining room, we were greeted by a din (roar).  A table laden with four or five young screaming children was joined by a table populated by six or seven entitled ""just teen"" girls screaming even louder.  The chorus was supplemented by a woman with a voice like Ethel Merman singing ... loud.The server only seemed interested in seeing that we bought a bottle of wine.  It required another 10-minutes for him to bring the wine and another 5-minutes to take our order. My wife enjoyed her salad.  My grilled vegetables were one of: over-cooked or under-cooked.  All were bland and tasteless, even after adding olive oil and vinegar.My wife enjoyed her seafood pasta.  The pasta was done «al dente».  My daily special lamb ragout with pasta was terrible.  The pasta was overcooked; the lamb was tough and tasteless. Indeed, the pasta was in the mid-$20 range.  As Mr. Sifton suggested in his article in the September 23, 2011 issue of the New York Times, a cheese omelet at the Viand Coffee Shop for under $10 would have been a far better value.",5,1,0,Mel C.,"Marin, CA",0,28,0

We were led to their table, passing through the well-appointed front room with its glass cases of gelato, pastries and cakes, to the warm and softly-lit space in the back. We were quickly seated; the people whom we joined were very happy with the meal they'd just finished.I ordered apricot sorbetto and hazelnut gelato, both of which were vibrantly flavored and excellent, along with an iced cappuccino. This arrived in a tall glass showing off horizontal bands of dark coffee and white milk -- it almost seemed a shame to stir it. It too was top notch. Others at the table had different gelato flavors and the apple tart, which was flaky, buttery, not too sweet and filled with tender, juicy fruit.The debonaire waiters were friendly and accommodating, and we felt no pressure to leave although it was late. The check arrived with dark chocolate leaves flavored with mint, a nice touch.Sant Ambroeus is great place for coffee and dessert; I'd go back for lunch or dinner sometime, too.

5.0,3/11/2011,"On point!My boyfriend and I saw the Sant Ambroeus (chocolate mousse cake) on Best Thing I Ever Ate- Sweet Tooth. The second I saw it, my sweet tooth (therefore, all my teeth) screamed in delight! I had to get it!Shortly after watching the episode, a trip to the Whitney put us in close proximity to the restaurant. I had never been to either SA location and upon creepily looking into the restaurant, we realized that we were a touch under dressed. It isn't dressy-dressy, but maybe not converse friendly. It was quickly decided that we didn't care- we wanted cake! We grabbed a seat at the bar and asked our friendly and attentive barista for the Sant Ambroeus chocolate mousse cake, a shot of espresso, and the cioccolata calda (hot chocolate).I am  very surprised more people have not reviewed this cake. If you appreciate a well made chocolate mousse, I highly recommend going to SA and getting its namesake cake. The mousse has a perfectly bold chocolate taste, but yet it still feels light. Add the fact that it has a rich chocolate custard center and BOOM! An explosion of decadence! It is delicious and even at $9, this tiny cake is well worth it. Pair it with anything under the ""Le Nostre Bevande Calde"" section, so you don't devour the entire cake in a minute! The espresso is one of the best we've had (I think Abraço's espresso is its main competitor thus far, but there are many others we have to hunt down still). I have also be searching for the best hot chocolate for a while now and the hot chocolate at SA is my #2 in the city! (Second only to the dark hot chocolate at The Chocolate Room) It is rich, thick-but not too thick, and made with semisweet chocolate. Delicious! At the end we mixed some hot chocolate with the espresso to make a lovely mocha. I am thus under the impression that the Sant  Ambroeus drink must also be delightful (espresso with thick hot chocolate,milk froth, cocoa powder).I will definitely be back many times!Enjoy!",3,2,2,Lindsay H.,"Brooklyn, NY",284,29,21
3.0,2/21/2011,"I don't know what I was expecting but it wasn't this.  If you are looking for a chic, urbane, cutting-edge sort of place...this is not it.  Sant Ambroeus is more old-school, more intimate with odd shaped dark wood tables in an strangely angular space,more Italy than New York.  It's cosy in there and warm - until a party of 10 holds open the door and the cold winter air drops the inside temperature by 10 degrees.The waiters are really on the ball - and obviously screened for sartorial elegance - I've seen worse dressed bankers! They promptly brought around a basket of warm bread and made recommendations of wine based on very vague (and slightly contradictory) hints from our table (We'd like it fruity, but not sweet, but not too dry either, and not too tannic, but a nice finish, and not too heavy please).  Somehow the waiter managed to present a Montepulciano that we all enjoyed. The best appetiser proved to be the tuna tartare.  My beet salad was lacking something - it just seemed a little dull.  Maybe its the wrong time of year for beets? Our party of six explored the menu from end to end - pasta, fish and seefood, filet mignon, lamb shank - and there was an unusual hush as we all tucked into our main courses.  My fluke was tender and light in a bright lemony sauce, cuddling sweetly with little mashed potato swirls.  Much ado was made in other reviews about the desserts.  I'm never very excited when presented with a tray of plastic wrapped desserts for me to choose from.  It seems to hint at mass production.  But, in the spirit of exploration, I overcame my initial misgivings and ordered the lemon ricotta cheesecake.  And it was good - smooth and light but with a slight tartness and a grainy texture that you sometimes get in cheesecakes...but not ""fireworks in my mouth"" delicious.All in all - A-OK.",2,1,3,Lisa M.,"New York, NY",95,245,15

5.0,6/5/2010,"Many years ago there were few places to get a truly wonderful cup of coffee. Back then, they were the only ones in this great city serving a proper cappuccino. Now there's a lot more competition but they still doing it right. San Ambroeus is fashioned after the barro-caffes around Italy which are quite casual but they're brought it up a notch, style wise. You'll be standing at the bar (they have 2 table in the front to sit, but as in Italy, the price is higher if you sit). the have  coffee, panini, cookie and gelato counters, order what you like, the girl will mark it off on you check, then receive and eat.The panini is expensive and small but absolutely phenomenal...and it's the real thing...not the crap the pass of as a panino all over Manhattan. The gelato is homemade and you can makes flavors...i like the cassis sorbet with pistachio gelato...a tried and true fave. The have a rotating menu of cookies and cakes, the merangue/nut and pignoli being my favorite cookies.I need to mention 2 more things. They make my absolute favorite cake in this city. Sometimes they have a slice for you to eat there but I order a whole cake (feeds about 8) a few days ahead of time. It's $65 and called the Profiterole cake but is amazing, absolutely amazing. Profiteroles inside, with chantilly and other cremes and some ganache....there's more to it but my explanation will not do it justice.That was all about the caffe part not for the restaurant part. Also delish and expensive...i come for the restaurant when I need a treat or some comfort food. It's Northern Italian...everything on the menu is deliceuse, pastas being particularly strong. The true shining star is the risotto ($20-24) they have 3 kinds which change by the season. It's the best risotto I've ever had...even better than in Italy.",0,0,0,Marina G.,"Rego Park, NY",42,154,0
4.0,5/20/2010,"So the address of this place makes me not want to go. I don't need to eat caviar on Madison Avenue, that's just silly. Madison Avenue is almost exclusively for window shopping. But, enter a night of dinner with my mom and Sant Ambroeus comes up in my list of acceptable places to take mother on the Upper East Side. I was so pleasantly surprised with the outcome that I would go back. Probably only when my mom is paying. Judge me however you want. It's expensive. Not that is wasn't worth the cost of the meal for the excellent service and even better Italian food. I enjoyed the seafood risotto as my entree, and went with a fried mozzarella appetizer that was one of the specials. D-E-L-I-C-I-O-U-S. The mozzarella melted in your mouth and was perfectly crispy. The seafood risotto was a huge entree, I ate all the seafood and a little of the rice, and there was a ton left over. I went with the caramel gelato at the end (I'm not a huge dessert person, but a co-worker suggested it) and it was seriously the greatest gelato I have ever come across. I will probably go back and get that from their take away counter before I spend a pretty penny on their dinners. I liked the atmosphere too, it was full of life and color, without being too modern or artsy. Pretty crystal chandeliers everywhere kept it swanky, but the overstuffed built-in banquette running along the wall kept it comfortable. The crowd in the front was much younger than those dining in the back. The set up is so odd but somehow works. Younger and trendy up front by the dessert case and bar, much older and classic Upper East Siders in Chanel and Brioni in the back.

I am always greeted with a smile and a delightful Buongiorno!! I order our macchiatos, pastries , and have them throw in a butter cook for Finnegan. I pay the bill while everything is quickly but professionally prepared. I head out with the goods to relieve Grahame of doggie duty while presenting him with his coffee and pastry. The coffee is exceptional and very reminiscent of the coffee I drink everyday while in Rome or Paris. The croissants are spectacular, soft, flaky and buttery with just enough apricot jam to satisfy any sweet tooth.
