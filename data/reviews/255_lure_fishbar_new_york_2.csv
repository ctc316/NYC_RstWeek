2.0,4/20/2019,"Super mediocre food. I ordered the steak which is maybe stupid at a fish place, but a good restaurant should be able to cook a filet. It was over cooked and lacking of any flavor. The scalloped potatoes weren't scalloped all, but rather semi-raw potatoes in a wimpy and thin cream sauce, with cheese on top, which scalloped potatoes don't normally have. The asparagus had so much lemon juice on it that it was almost unbearable to eat. The staff was friendly and the drinks were good but this was one of the worst meals I've had in a while in NYC.",0,0,0,Cam F.,"Roswell, GA",3,25,1

4.0,4/8/2019,"This is not a budget conscience place. It leans to the expensive side. At  $20 for a martini you are not going to having a bunch. Our drink bill was over $100 and it was just my wife, me and two kids.Now the place. The sushi and sashimi platters were good. It came with fresh ground wasabi. My wife got the fish with fennel. Not a morsel was left on the plate which is unlike my wife. The homemade sodas my kids enjoyed. I would not get to filled up though on the meals. The deserts are epic. I ice creamed sandwiches made in house could be shared. The homemade ice cream is  yummy. My wife's desert did not stand a chance. I would return without hesitation, however next time I may grab my martini or a couple drinks else where first and save myself the 100.",0,0,0,Greg W.,"New York, NY",50,144,62
5.0,4/6/2019,"I cannot shower this dining establishment with enough accolades. I ordered fried calamari and it came with a sauce on top. I mentioned to Angie, the waitress, that I didn't care for the sauce. She asked me what I would like instead so I said well I wouldn't mind the shrimp tempura. The manager, Dennis, brought the shrimp tempura and wouldn't you know it it also came with sauce. He asked me how I liked it and I said it's great except I'm not really a big fan of the sauce. He then proceeded to bring me yet another order without sauce! Food was outstanding! Highly recommend!",0,0,0,Denise M.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,5,0
2.0,3/31/2019,"Good location, cool atmosphere, but that was all.  Sushi was like take out, entree of salmon and striped bass were small portions and something I often cook better at home.  It was my fiancé's birthday and when we got there we asked for a booth.  The entire place was empty, but they gave us a bad table in a corner that our waiters and staff couldn't even reach over to get to.  Place was packed and too busy for us to even get refills on water.  I had one friend who had spoken very highly of this spot for years, but we will not be going back. Asked for a whiskey in the menu and they were out of it too.  Just not a smooth dinner and left us ready for the check and ready to leave.",0,0,0,Aaron R.,"Manhattan, NY",1,25,6

5.0,3/22/2019,"I came in for a late lunch and grabbed a seat at the bar only to find out it was Restaurant Week! Usually I avoid the occasion due to lackluster service and reduced food quality (looking at you Delmonico's). But I am happy to report that Lure treated me exceptionally well and the food was outstanding! Heather was working the bar that day and she was warm and friendly. As patrons moved in and out, it seemed like everyone who sat down was a regular who had known her for years. I love that! The music was background, I couldn't tell you what it was, only that it was played at a low volume and was there only to compliment the environment. I decided to do order salmon for my appetizer and my entree. I started with the tartar. Excellent choice, there were shallots whose sweet crunch exploded with each bite, and they dressed the plate with an Aji Amarillo sauce. The pepper used as the base for this sauce is often seen in Peruvian cuisine, and it has a brighter flavor that stands out from other peppers like jalapeno or habanero. I love it every time I have it and it worked well here. My entree was a soy marinated salmon with Chinese broccoli and shiitake mushrooms. The dish didn't take any risks- it was just good quality food cooked and presented perfectly. It was also a large portion for the price. Between these two items I left very full, and also feeling like I had a healthy, wholesome meal. Their lunch option doesn't automatically include dessert, but you can add it for a supplementary charge (this is normal for places whose menus have a higher price point). I came back again for dinner and sat at the sushi bar. Loved getting to watch the sushi get made! Their special kumamoto oysters with wasabi leaf might be one of my new favorite things anywhere. It's got just the right amount of kick and brine, really luxurious.  They have a happy hour menu, I think from 5-7, that I'm almost positive includes oysters and other small plates.",3,0,2,Luci B.,"Queens, NY",149,1401,3214
4.0,3/20/2019,Loved Lure. What a great choice of oysters from all regions. We had the salmon and branzino as entrees and loved the way they were cooked.

4.0,3/15/2019,"Great place for lunch but comes at a steep price!The food and service calls for 5 stars, but because of the pricing, I had to bring it down to 4. I heard about this place for years and finally decided to pop in for a quick meal. I realized I passed by many times before but never noticed the restaurant because it is not on ground level. The decor inside was very unique - designed like the inside of a ship with vintage vibes. The nautical theme was definitely not overdone though which I appreciated.Walked in without a reservation for lunch and was seated right away.Started with some signature oysters (the wasabi & jalapeno ones were my personal favorite). I got the branzino as my entree and it was DELICIOUS. The super creamy buttery but light sauce with the flaky branzino made a great combination. The sashimi combo was fresh and presented beautifully but I thought it was WAY too expensive for what it was ($68).Overall, I enjoyed my meal there and would like to go back for dinner one day.",0,0,0,Hannah J.,"SUNNYSIDE, NY",144,82,73

5.0,2/24/2019,I don't particularly like Bloody Marys but this was the best Bloody Mary I've never had. It came with an oyster shooter.  Sushi was fresh- you are able to alter orders.

4.0,2/14/2019,"Great place for dinner...ambiance and décor make it feel like you are on a cruise ship. From the port hole windows outside looking in, to the shape of the ceiling looking like a boat. Great service for the evening.Note: they will not seat you til your entire party arrives, so don't be late when you make reservations. Came here for winter restaurant week - the regular menu looks good too. My friends and I tried the Kenai roll and tuna tartare appetizers - both were delicious.Main course: Miso glazed salmon with snap peas and mushrooms. Added side of roasted brussel sprouts. Delicious! Had the lychee martini - strange that it was made with gin instead of vodka...strange tasting..prefer vodka instead. Will have to try another drink next time.Desserts were ok - mixed sorbets (raspberry flavor was the best of the 3) and apple crumble was ok.",0,0,0,Winny L.,"New York, NY",29,162,1964
4.0,2/14/2019,"The 4 star review is based on the ambiance, food, and service.Ambiance: the restaurant is romantic and makes you feel like you are on a boat. Very cute restaurant with spacious seating and welcoming waiters. Sometimes the wait can be up to 20 minutes, but they try their best to get you a table ASAP. They would even offer for their customers to sit by the bar first, especially if happy hour started.Service: Our waiter was very nice and explained all the great dishes they were known for and what to expect. He was very helpful, and in the end I ended up getting some seafood and a salmon for my main dish. Food: Although we had a few seafood dishes, my fiancé ordered the hamburger because the waiter said that it was one of their top dishes. The hamburger won several awards and therefore it was also a must try. The seafood appetizers, and the my main dish (salmon) was cooked to perfection. Everything tasted amazingly, and nothing was overly salted. All the flavors complimented each other. Now, where this restaurant lost that one star! The hamburger was not as good as the waiter made it sound. The patty was ok, slightly dry and their wasn't anything out of the ordinary. There wasn't a wow factor or something to set it aside from other fast food hamburgers. We were not happy about it. I would recommend coming to Lure for dinner and have a nice romantic dinner. Order seafood (especially the salmon), and stay AWAY from the hamburger. It's just not worth the money and time.",0,0,0,Lena Z.,"Flushing, NY",18,62,26
4.0,2/11/2019,"This review is probably more of a 3.5 stars but I'll round up. Ate dinner here last night, and it was good, but not *great*. I could see the possibility where others could have a better experience. Let me explain (and I'll try not to sound too negative). ATMOSPHERE: Lure is about 1 block from my office, so I've been planning on eating here for a while. The ambience does not disappoint. Everything is beautiful like the interior of a ship, seems like an excellent place to people watch. Problem is.. we got seated in the worst seats in the restaurant. I was facing a nondescript wood wall, we were elbow to elbow with the couples next to us, and our table was not stable (wish I were making this up). I guess this is just bad luck of the draw, so I can't hold it against them.SERVICE: our waitress was awesome, and water glasses were consistently filled. I'm not sure if it's what we ordered, but the service was kind of slow. We ordered around 7:10pm, appetizers came out around 7:50pm, dinner around 8:15pm. Great if you want to have a long conversation with someone, not so great if you are hungry. I don't think this is a positive or a negative, just FYI. FOOD: almost everything we ordered was amazing, with the exception of one item which was bad ordering on my part but really soured the meal for me. For appetizers, we ordered the Steak Tartare, Deviled Eggs, and Tempura Shrimp. I would recommend all of them. They were sooo good. Must order! For an entree, we ordered the Crispy Asian Snapper for 2. In fairness, I can see where people would like it. But it was not my kind of dish. Positives I will say are: presentation was great, and it was cooked well. I was expecting Snapper for 2 like I've had at other restaurants, which is a relatively unseasoned light fish. But this was exactly the opposite. The two things I didn't like were: it was fried, and heavily seasoned/spicy. It tasted like something you would get at PF Changs. I'm aware this is my mistake, I should have read the title better (CRISPY and ASIAN... duh Chris). Also, it upset my stomach. Honestly, it's the next day and I still feel kind of gross. I would recommend not ordering. If I could do it over I would have ordered the Surf and Turf. Definitely would have been enough food. If we had been lucky and gotten seated in a different location, and I had ordered the Surf and Turf or really any other entree, I'm relatively confident this would have been a 5 star review. But we did have some issues so I would give Lure Fishbar a 3.5/5. Will be back sometime in the future, and update this review.",4,0,3,Chris B.,"New York, NY",110,61,237
5.0,2/9/2019,"I went for restaurant week and has a great experience. The decor is adorable, and it feels like you're in a yacht. Service was friendly and mostly just left you alone, which I appreciated. We also weren't rushed at all despite the fact that it was a Friday evening, and we stayed for over two hours. Finally, the portions were far larger than I expected. My friend and I ordered different items and split it all, and everything was delicious.

4.0,2/6/2019,"I had a really great restaurant week meal at this place. Everything was perfectly cooked. Shrimp tempura was crispy and served with a sauce that was just sweet enough and really decadent. Miso salmon was perfectly cooked and seasoned. Excellent. I've also been to this place a few times for the sushi and dim sum and both are really excellent. There is no better raw bar in this price range in the city. My only complaint is that the dining room is really loud, as in really, really loud. If you want to have a conversation over your meal, you don't need to skip this place. Just don't show up during prime time. Once the lunch rush is over, it's quiet enough, comfortable, and the service is top notch.",0,0,0,Scot N.,"Portland, OR",522,70,0

They really do everything right. Coming to Lure is an experience, and I always leave feeling satisfied and impressed.

The food is amazing, drinks are strong and tasty.... service can be a little slow but as long as I don't have an empty glass, it's all good. Favorite starters: The oysters with vodka and caviar are ridiculously good. All of the rolls are delicious and so fresh. Steak tartare is always so yummy as are the tuna tacos and grilled octopus. Main courses that keep us coming back: Sea Urchin Bucatini..... whoa! Crispy Asian snapper for 2 is a must! Scallops, I know.. such a basic b thing to order but i'm telling you, it's like butta!!Sides: most mains come with sides BUT if you love mac and cheese like my hubby does (seriously, if it's on the menu, here's got to try it) their lobster mac and cheese is the ish!!",1,1,0,Alexandra B.,"New York, NY",0,11,7

I came here on New Year's Eve as my dinner before going out and celebrating and it was definitely a very hip and cool spot. Since it's a seafood restaurant, the interior is decorated as a ship. The nautical theme definitely won this place an extra star. As for food, I would give it a solid 3-star rating. It isn't bad, but it also isn't anything special. We got buffalo chicken, calamari, and fish entree and all in all, I just didn't think any of the flavors were anything special. I don't know if it was a New Year's policy, or if this is normally the case, but we had to put down a $50 deposit each (which was used towards our meal).

We were staying in Soho for the weekend and we were looking for a great Seafood restaurant and we ended up with 9:45 pm reservation at lure because it was last minute res. I thought maybe things would be winding down that late. Not even close, the place was hopping. Kinda loud and to be honest I was put off at first, like how am I going to get a cocktail when it's three deep at the bar?!Well, even though it was crazy busy the bartender was quick to catch my eye and brought two super tasty cocktails. I have to say it was a hip, well dressed crowd in the restaurant. People watching was easy and fun. Even our waitress looked just like Meghan Markle. We shared caviar to start and it was delicious. The stuffed lobster was incredible. The stuffing was so light and fluffy devoid of sticky bread crumb fillers.The lobster was perfectly tender and juicy. It's so easy to overcook lobster and make it tough. Only downside is that it's loud.

As soon as we checked in with the hostess, they greeted us with champagne. All of the wait staff was super attentive and friendly. The inside of the restaurant is also very cute and has a luxury yacht-like interior.My husband and I ordered the Tuna Tartare (with Avocado, Cucumber, Jalapeño, and a Sea Urchin Vinaigrette) and the Kenai Roll (Spicy Salmon, Cucumber, Scallion, and Crispy Shallots) as appetizers. Both apps were amazing! Light and refreshing.We also ordered the Lobster Fra Diavolo (Squid Ink Tagliatelle with Shrimp, Calamari, and Spicy Tomato) and the Nori Crusted Tuna (over Garlic Fried Rice, Chinese Broccoli, and a Citrus Emulsion) for entrees. The nori crusted tuna itself was OK. The fried rice didn't taste like fried rice. The rice also lacked some flavor. I preferred my husband's lobster dish over mine. The seafood on his dish was cooked perfectly and had a lot of flavor.For dessert, we ordered dark Chocolate Mousse (with salted caramel Sauce, candied Pecans, Cookie Crumble). I'm not a big dessert fan, but this was amazing! We also ordered the Strawberry Shortcake. I felt that the shortcake was a bit dry.

4.0,11/22/2018,"I really liked Lure my first visit and only anticipate more visits. We came on a Wednesday night without a reservation and got seated right away. For tasty seafood fare and drinks in a fancy yacht/nautical setting, you can expect good food, a nice atmosphere, and unpretentious service. If feels a bit upscale and intimate, so it would be great for special occasions too. We ordered some cocktails, half a dozen of East and West coast oysters, and Buffalo Chicken Lollipops to start. They have a pretty good variety of oysters to choose from. Oysters were fresh and clean. The chicken lollipops were tasty as well. They brought out a complementary dish of truffled deviled eggs with caviar, which was a nice little bonus. For main entree, I opted for the Sea Urchin Bucatini, which comes with blue crab as well. My bf had the Lure Burger ""Bash Style"". I've actually heard great things about the burger here, so while it's a seafood restaurant, there are non-fish items off the menu, though limited. The Bucatini was great, but it was more blue crab than I was expecting. The uni was pretty minimal, as expected, but I enjoyed the pasta and the crushed red pepper added a nice bit of spice. The sauce is on the creamy side, and I was surprised by the rather large portion size. My bf enjoyed his burger alot. It comes with bacon and onion jam. Honestly, I think I may have to get the burger next time I'm at Lure. Overall, without a reservation and just coming for the hell of it on a random night without having to wait for a table was a win.

2.0,11/19/2018,"Went for dinner on a Monday. Had a reservation for two. We were sat at the table right in front of the host stand, next to the door; the restaurant was pretty empty. I would understand being sat here if it was busy and we walked in without a reservation. Table was uncomfortable. Waiter came over, did not introduce himself. We were mid-conversation when he (in a very quiet voice) asked us if we wanted still or sparkling water, we said still. When the bill came he had charged us $10 for water. I guess we were dumb to not say tap; but, again we were mid conversation and could barely hear him (in an empty restaurant). We ordered two glasses of Pinot Noir; at $18 a glass, I would like a new bottle, but he came with a chilled bottle of half empty wine. Meh. We ordered the Lobster Mac and Cheese and a Lobster Roll to share. Mac and cheese had maybe 4 bites of lobster. Again, Meh. Lobster roll was not worth the price; small, bland.

3.0,10/23/2018,"Had dinner this past weekend. Both the Chardonnay (by the glass) and lychee martini were very good. The server was very attentive throughout. Water glass refilled, checked on the table 3x during the meal. Friendly banter, too. The seating layout permitted private conversation, which was nice. The bar area was well appointed and probably conducive to a pretty nice happy hour during the week. Appetizers were of average (tuna tacos) and below average (crab cake) quality. Premium pricing for very mundane food. Bronzino main course was above average. Perfectly cooked, excellent sauce. The sushi was pedestrian. The key lime pie dessert was the highlight of the meal. Executive Summary: For average food and three drinks, the $240 bill was a bit steep. Would choose Del Frisco's or Il Mulino every time for much better quality food at the same price level.

5.0,9/4/2018,"I came in on a Friday night with 2 friends after a workout. We made reservations and I honestly did not know what to expect of this place, except that it was highly recommended. It was a bit difficult to find because you do have to go down the stairs to enter the restaurant, but I was in awe as soon as when we entered. I felt as if I had just entered a restaurant on a luxurious boat/cruise ship. The way the booths, ceilings and light fixtures were set up really mimicked the feel of being on a boat. A friend and I started off with drinks while waiting for the third person in our party. I ordered the La Piña Picante, which has jalapeño infused cazadores, cointreau, lime and mango. This was the best margarita I have EVER had. You can definitely taste the spice and the mango in it. It was the perfect blend of ingredients and went down so smoothly. Our waitress also brought complementary salt and vinegar chips to snack on while waiting.When everyone arrived, we placed our orders for the meal. I ordered the Hellfire Roll (8pcs) from the sushi menu and Lobster Mac n' Cheese from the sides menu. I love tuna and there was a whole lot of it on this roll. It tasted fresh and the rice was perfect. There was also cucumber, tempura flakes, avocado and kimchi sauce. The cucumber is something new I've tried in sushi and I really liked how it blended in nicely with this roll. I'm so glad I asked the waitress how large the Lobster Mac n' Cheese was because it was perfect for me and a friend to share. It tasted similar to one I've tried at a different restaurant but it definitely satisfied the craving I've been having for it. My other friends ordered other rolls off the sushi menu, but we received an order of Grilled Octopus (compliments of the chef). It was unexpected and greatly appreciated. It was mixed in with chickpeas and it was cooked/seasoned well. It was easy cut apart and eat. I haven't met a server as excellent as who was serving us this night. I wish I had remembered her name because I'd have loved to give her a shout out here. She gave great recommendations about the drinks and food, she always checked on often and she went above and beyond to see if any booths were going to open up so we could get moved to one. She was so friendly that we'd invite her to join us if she wasn't working! This place is a bit pricey, but I would love to come back for a special occasion!

So service was pretty crappy compared to how it should be of a truly good restaurant...For food, the highlights were the lobster Mac and cheese and the birthday cake (chocolate) and ice cream sandwiches. I would give the food a 4.5/5. Don't get sushi here, very mediocre and overpriced The thing that is the true highlight is the ambiance and interior. The restaurant is sort of in a basement but absolutely beautiful inside with wood paneling and dim lighting. It is meant to look like a ship inside and it sure does! Loved that part.

Small world.  She had this energy about her that made our whole experience so much fun. She provided great recommendations and checked on us constantly to refresh our drinks.  We initially intended to order a few appetizers and then move on to main courses.  With all the great recommendation we ended up ordering plate after plate of appetizers and sushi. OMG so good! The fish was so fresh and flavorful.  Literally melted in your mouth. These are a few things we ordered (we ordered so much I can't recall every item):1. Crispy Oyster Deviled Eggs2. Kanpahci Sashimi - pretty sure we had at least 4 of these!3. Black Sea Bass Crudo4. Lobster Roll5. Tuna Avacado Roll6. Rainbow Roll7. King Crab California Roll8.

The interior is nautical and beautiful, high ceilings, gorgeous bar area. Extensive wine list, though they didn't have the Corsican rosé we were stoked to see on the menu. My most recent visit wasn't great. The intervals in between receiving drinks and being able to order was quite long, though I let the waiter know we were ready to order when our beers hit the table. I watched him sort of wander around for 10 mins before he came back. This also happened after we declined the dessert menus and wanted to pay and leave. About 80% my slow baked halibut was translucent - uncooked. As halibut is a bottom feeder and prone to worms, you cannot serve any portion of it raw. It was not edible, and no one came around to ask me why I wasn't eating my fish. They just eventually cleared my plate. I did ask for a side to be packaged to go, which they neglected to do.

3.0,4/27/2018,"Food was excellent but service was mediocre .We came here for my birthday celebration . We had a group of 6 and was seated at a very small booth that could fit at most 4 people comfortably.  We asked for a bigger table and was told by the manager unfortunately that was the largest they had.  Although we saw many empty tables in the back of the restaurant so not sure why he would not accompany our request. Lucky we were all girls was able to sit snuggly. Food is excellent at Lure. We loved the sushi and rolls here and everything was fresh and delicious. Several of us ordered the scallops as entree and it was very good also.  The lobster Mac and cheese was to die for. After we paid our bills we were sitting here and waiting for our friends from using bathroom and getting ready to leave. While we were sitting there was no longer than 10 mins, the managers came over and started taking our napkins from the table and said to us hope we enjoyed our meal( without even looking at us or making eye contacts) we felt like he was coming over to tell us time to leave. We all got up and left the restaurant and when we're leaving the same manager did not even look up once or said anything like good night or come back again.Our group of 6 spent close to $900 for the dinner and for that price we paid, we expected a better service.

3.0,4/25/2018,"Note: This review is based on sitting in the bar area and ordering from the Happy Hour menu. As others have noted, when you walk down the stairs off the street and into the restaurant, you have entered the main dining room of a big ship. In a cool, old-school kind of way. I liked the atmosphere. Happy hour menu looked good enough to work with for us. Kind of limited cocktail options, but the Vida Loca was excellent. Not too sweet, just smokey enough to taste the mescal and refreshing. If you like mescal, don't be scared off by the sweet-sounding description. If you don't know if you like mescal, don't let that scare you aware from this drink. Not a bad ""starter-mescal"" option. Blistered sashito peppers came out first. Really large portion, especially for happy hour. Tasty peppers, nicely blistered with a lemon aioli sauce and salt on the side. The sashito pepper Gods weren't on our side though--not a single hot one in the bunch this time. Next out was the salmon avocado roll. Not super flavorful for some reason, but it was very fresh and we enjoyed it. Last out was the Plateaux for 2. Six oysters, 4 shrimp, 4 clams and 2 crab claws. Happy hour price is $35, which sounded like a great deal. Unfortunately, this was the more disappointing of the menu options for the night. Not sure if they do the happy hour version differently, but the oysters and crab claw were possibly the smallest of each that I've ever seen. The clams were small too--but this is the first time I've ever had clams in the shell so maybe they're always this small. The shrimp were a healthy size and were very good--definitely the star of the plate. The service was excellent--very professional. The pacing of the various items coming out was perfect. Both bars (sushi bar is in the back) seemed like fun bars to hang out at. Had the Plateaux for 2 been little more robust, I'd probably have gone with 4 stars.",0,0,0,Mark R.,"Double Oak, TX",8,119,4
4.0,4/25/2018,"Awesome space. Has that whole ""casual yet upper-echelon"" feel going on. Place is PACKED out with tools. All Wall Street, trust fund bros. Tried not to let that influence my rating, and I think I accomplished that, but still, definitely not my favorite people hang out at this place. Regardless of this, Lure still serves very good sea food. Tuna Tacos were good, Calamari was solid, lobster croutons very interesting, and the sushi was on par with every good restaurant that serves sushi. But that's not why I came here.The Bash Burger with onion rings lives up to the hype. Definitely in my top 10 for favorite burgers in NYC. Burger doesn't rely on toppings for flavor. The meat is just a great cut, juicy, and cooked perfectly. The seafood is great don't get me wrong, but it is severely overpriced.

5.0,4/8/2018,"""I Christen Thee, The Flying Wasp""Walking down the steps, I didn't know what to expect from Lure Fishbar.  Once inside the space, its like you stepped onto a yacht. Blond curved woods are throughout this nautical themed restaurant.The menu is substantial, there are so many things I'd like to try but I'm here on a mission. I've had the Bash Burger bookmarked for so long, its time the both of us met.Before we ordered, my cousin ordered a lobster bisque soup. Not to be outdone, I get my New England on and ordered the New England Clam Chowder as well as a Lobster Beer from Maine. The clam chowder was loaded with full clam belies and potatoes. I hate New England Clam Chowder that the pieces are so small you have to search for them with every spoonful. This is not the case wth the soup being served at Lure Fishbar. The soup came to me, piping hot and very fresh. They're really living up to their Fishbar name. Now I'm ready to get bashed. The burger comes to the table. Topped with two onion rings and a side of french fries. I had to ask, are these fries cooked in duck fat? Fries normally evaluate the burger meal, that burger was the star of the show. The fries to me were secondary to my new burger champ. And the onion rings? The coating wasn't weak, it was a nice addition to the burger.The burger creation from chef Josh Capon, I understand why it won the Popular Vote at the Burger Bash. The Pat La Frieda beef patty, made from premium Pat La Frieda beef is topped with caramelized onion and bacon jam. The bun? A sesame seeded, Big Marty's potato bun.Chef Capon has a special sauce topped with pickles, it is a creation of a simple roadside California burger but it's chef'ed up with some amazing ingredients. Are you with me so far? After I finished, I said damn that was a pretty incredible burger. I get it now. Minetta Tavern has a black label burger with a Pat La Frieda beef patty. This is a different meat blend and a different style burger altogether. In the end, It made my top 5 burger list. If you haven't tried the Bash Burger, by all means you have to come to Lure Fishbar and try this burger.Highly recommended.",16,8,10,Bill S.,"Long Island, NY",601,2493,5315

4.0,2/18/2018,"My friends and I paid a visit here during Restaurant Week to take advantage of the 3 course meal deal for $42 . For a majority of the time we spent in the venue, it was spent waiting, since the restaurant was packed on a Friday evening. We even had to ask for 2 rounds of complimentary potato chips since we were getting hungry from waiting too long.For starters, I started off with the Tuna Tartare, which came with pickled celery, a dab of jalepeno, and horseradish aioli. Tuna was fresh and not fishy at all. I'm not a even a big fan of fish, and this dish was delicious for my tasting. The horseradish aioli and jalepeno definitely added a nice kick to the overall dish. Overall rating: 4.5/5.A lot of Yelpers recommended the Nori Crusted Tuna, so I opted for that. Again, fresh tuna. Nori and Chinese broccoli added a nice little crunch. But what really caught me by surprise was the garlic fried rice. It was surprisingly delicious and did not have an overpowering aftertaste of garlic. Overall rating: 5/5Their pistachio cake that they offered for dessert was also mouth-watering. Candied pistachios stole the show for this dessert. Overall rating: 5/5.Overall, the food was delectable, but the service was slow. Atmosphere was incredibly loud.

4.0,2/16/2018,"Tucked away under the corner of Prince/Mercer is Lure Fishbar. It has a very Long Island restaurant feel to me but everything here is excellent.That being said, it is quite pricey - so just be aware of that. The crispy sushi rice is one of their signature appetizers. You can get it with spicy tuna, yellowtail/jalapeno, uni/jalapeno and blue crab. 3 pc. for $19 and 5 pc. for $32.The rolls are good but not particularly noteworthy. What'd you expect from a seafood-forward restaurant of this caliber. If you are going to get one, I'd recommend the Hellfire Roll for $22. It's the most interesting and is a flavorful special roll of tuna on tuna with some heat.The star for me though is the Nori Crusted Tuna for $39. It's expensive for what it is but it's weirdly satisfying. It doesn't knock you back and while it's all very familiar.. it's just really good. It's three large pieces of seared tuna with a nice crust, dobs of spicy mayo surrounding a moist garlic fried rice. Mix it all up to give your mouth something that'll make you smile.If you want to get the most bang for your buck, come here during Restaurant Week.

3.0,2/8/2018,"The first time I wandered into Lure, it was late afternoon, I had been shopping and I needed a break.  What I found was a haven.  The restaurant was an oasis of quiet, the bartender friendly and attentive.  The half dozen oysters, the deviled eggs with roe, and the cool glass of Sancerre (the bartender poured me a complimentary half glass after I settled the check) was all the refreshment I needed.  I mentally filed the restaurant away as a potential place to go for dinner with my S.O. when we had a little money to burn.We came back for dinner on a Saturday night and, oh, how the scene had changed.  The bar was crowded with shrieking women, the cavernous restaurant packed to capacity, models stalked the length of it, and celebrity looking types skulked in the corners.  Even so, it reminded me of a high end wedding reception.We had to wait twenty minutes for our table even though we had a reservation.  After our overpriced Negronis, we were sat along the banquette.  We quickly realized conversation was impossible - we couldn't hear each other speak.  We shared a shellfish ""plateaux,"" along with an extra dozen pristine oysters.  A plate-licking grilled octopus followed.  The ""crispy calamari with smoked chili glaze"" reminded me of the same dish I served at least thousand times 20 years ago when I was waiting tables at a ""New American"" restaurant on Long Island.  Chef, it's time for an update.  Maybe I got what I deserved by ordering the surf and turf, but again, I couldn't shake the ""wedding reception"" vibe, even with the uni butter. Service was spotty.  Our server was clearly very busy and doing his best.  But it took awhile for him to take our order.  The calamari came out while we were still tackling the shellfish plateaux.  There was not a clear inch on the entire table, and still the runner kept looking at us expectantly, like if he only wished hard enough we would find some room for him to put down the dish - we sent him back to the kitchen.  Our server came back to inquire about how we liked the calamari, but we hadn't gotten it.  It took another twenty minutes for it to make a second appearance.  So, Lure on a Wednesday afternoon, versus Lure on a Saturday night are two very different animals.  Still, if I owned a restaurant, I would aim to have the level of service remain consistent, regardless of day or time.  I had really wanted to like this place and was disappointed.",0,0,0,Jessica D.,"New York, NY",4,158,0

4.0,2/6/2018,"I came here with two friends and ended up trying their restaurant week. I chose the tuna tartare to start, miso salmon as the entree, and the chocolate mousse to end the meal. I must say I enjoyed each of the dishes. The tartare is a bit on the small portion side but that's okay since it is part of restaurant week. I liked the flavors and thought it was refreshing. There is a strong green flavor though which made me think of cilantro so if you're not into that maybe choose something else. My friend ordered the kenai roll for appetizer which I though was disappointing. It was small and not rolled well. The Miso Glazed Salmon I asked to be cooked medium and I thought it was cooked perfectly. The sugar snap peas and mushrooms that came with it were so flavorful! I would definitely recommend the salmon. If you're into pasta the Lobster Fra Diavolo was quite good as well.  As for the dessert, the pistachio cake was pretty good but my choice was the rich Dark Chocolate Mousse.

The food was tasty, but not the best I've had in the city by a long shot.The Food -Tuna tartare appetizer - the fish was fresh and the dish came together in a very tasty wayKonai roll - extremely average, could have gotten it at the sushi place across the street from my apartment and not noticed a differenceSalmon with snap peas and mushrooms - perfectly cooked but extremely plain/bland. None of the flavors popped or stood out as being particularly amazing but the salmon was well seasoned and cooked perfectly. I personally liked that the vegetables weren't too oily, seemed healthier than I was expecting.Crusted tuna - probably the best dish, the flavor was bold and delicious and the rice was perfectly cooked (not too sticky and had a good flavor)Sorbet - pretty sure the raspberry one was Haagen daaz, the others were unremarkable but fineChocolate mousse - tasty, rich and fairly unremarkable.The best part of dessert was the little biscotti/cookie that was served with the espresso - it was warm and slightly soft from being freshly baked, it was maybe the best part of the entire meal.Portion sizes in general were generous, larger than I was expecting given RW but not so much that you'd have leftovers. Just the right amount!The Service -Not sure the waiter actually spoke to us (there was a service switch right after we placed our order and the person who took over did not interact with us other than to give us the check), but the water was refilled every 30 seconds by a bus boy so we got both a lot of attention and none all at the same time.The Vibe -This was the best part for sure.The yacht vibe and the lighting was very romantic and relaxing, loved it.

I can't see myself eating these 2 dishes again. The burger without a doubt I would come back for anytime!Finally, the dessert, pistachio layer cake and chocolate mousse. Super basic desserts, there's no Pizazz in these desserts. I can order these at a deli or grocery store.

Dark hardwoods, round windows, seagoing fixtures;  All without any risk of motion sickness.  Lure sails only on calm seas.My wife had clam chowder and loved it. I had shrimp tempura.  Forget the tempuras you've had in the past.  This was better. Large plump piping hot shrimp with a delicate non greasy coating, smothered in spicy sesame mayo, all  with a scattering of sesame seeds.  This set the standard for what I expect from shrimp tempura henceforth.My entree was miso glazed salmon.  The fish was moist and tender, with a firm miso outer layer that provided contrast. It was over sugar snap peas, that had a sweet crunch, and shiitake mushrooms were interspersed for a touch of earthiness. Loved the entree.For desert, I chose pistachio layer cake.

4.0,1/27/2018,"If you are in Soho and need a break from shopping, consider stopping in at Lure.  Delicious (but not totally authentic) sushi. Fresh and tasty oysters here.  An adventurous place menu-wise to get your fish-fix.  Lots of options and freshness was not an issue.  Key when you are eating fish, am I right?Our cocktails were pretty good, but a little watered down. Our server was charming and warm, but over sat as we arrived and thus we did not get the best attention or service.  I blame this for our watered down drinks as hubby and I theorized they sat and got melty because or server was too overwhelmed.  Hefty price tag for lunch.  So not for the wallet-tight.  Our bill was over $200 after tipping (yes; I still gave 20%---I used to be a good server and know how hard it is) so if you want to spend your money on those shoes or that purse find a cheaper place to dine.",0,0,0,Darby W.,"Savannah, GA",38,124,80
2.0,1/26/2018,"My boyfriend and I decided to come here for lunch for restaurant week. Although the food was good and the environment looks stunning, we feel like the the food was not worth what we paid for. My boyfriend and I paid a total of $90 something including tax and tips. Originally we thought that the three course lunch was worth $29 for each of us since it is the deal for restaurant week, but for whatever reason my boyfriend's plate of 10 piece sushi costs a additional $12. Of course, it was not the restaurant's fault since the menu does state the $12 supplement, but I thought that the 10 piece sushi could of been ordered elsewhere for cheaper and better taste(we are big sushi eaters). My favorite was the clam chowder, but their herb roasted chicken and pistachio layer cake was not as appeasing as I thought it would be. Although the environment was lovely and decorated as if we were on a fancy yacht, we left disappointed with the food quantity and quality, and felt slightly ripped off to be honest.",0,0,0,Angela L.,"Woodside, NY",207,27,47
4.0,1/26/2018,"I'll start with the good news: The food was excellent and our server was extraordinary.Getting there was the problem: Despite having a 7pm reservation, our table was not ready on time. They initially put our party of four at a table where one of the parties (in this case, me) was in the way of every server going by, so they kept hitting my seat. At this point I moved my seat back to make it impossible for the servers to pass through and requested that we be moved to another table. After ten minutes of begrudgingly promising to move us, they finally moved us into the ""private area"" which has several tables that can be curtained off from the rest of the restaurant.The private area (which is partly underneath Prince Street - you can see the underside of the street!) is excellent. It is not as loud as the rest of the restaurant (which is is MUCH, MUCH TOO LOUD) and the service there was wonderful.So in review, loved the food and the wait staff, but the front desk was miserable to work with.",0,0,0,Steven H.,"Newark, NJ",0,38,1
4.0,1/21/2018,"Came here for a formal dinner with a group of friends. Pros - execution of dishes were delicious. Cons - definitely on the pricey side.We started off with the seafood tower, Royale size. It was fine. For $140 split between 4 people, I personally didn't find it worth it.I then got the Lobster Mac and Cheese and Steak tartare. Both were delicious. The lobster mac and cheese was super cheesey with aldente pasta. Plenty of lobster bits in it. The steak tartare was fresh, nicely chopped and seasoned well.I also tried the Nori Crusted Tuna. I usually don't like to order tuna at restaurants unless it is sushi but when I tried my boyfriend's, I found it delicious! I would order it again. The tuna tasted fresh and was nicely portioned. It was on a bed of garlic fried rice and that was amazing. I really liked the rice. We ended the meal with their key lime pie which was also very good, especially since I am not a fan of key lime, I still really liked it. It has a cream texture and the key lime wasn't overpowering, perfect balance between sweet and sour. Overall, it was a really good meal. A bit pricey but can't really escape it from a seafood restaurant. The restaurant itself is beautifully decorated, like the interior of a fancy yacht and the service was really nice.",5,2,10,Michelle L.,"New York, NY",888,585,2091
5.0,1/19/2018,"I had such an awesome night at Lure. I've been here before for happy hour, but this was my first time actually dining in. Everything was amazing! The decor/set up of this restaurant is beautiful - it's as if you're dining on the inside of a yacht. It was pretty busy and they had music playing, but it wasn't overwhelmingly loud. Our server, Cristine, was very helpful with assisting us with our dinner choices.  For starters, we tried the tempura shrimp - which was excellent. The sesame mayo had just enough kick, but wasn't too spicy and the shrimp were nice and plump. And there were just enough for both my friend and I. For entrees, we both wanted to try the nori crusted tuna, but we felt that we shouldn't get the same thing. So I let him get the tuna and I opted for the seared jalapeño sirloin, and we shared a side of roasted cauliflower. It was amazing! Cooked perfectly. The steak was succulent and the teriyaki sauce, shiitake mushrooms complimented it very well - and the jalapeños gave it that extra spicy kick! The nori crusted tuna was phenomenal and so was the garlic fried rice that accompanied it. They were great portions and we were so stuffed that we couldn't even look at the dessert menu. This is definitely a restaurant to try. I love it and so will you!",1,0,1,Kendal F.,"Harlem, Manhattan, NY",162,91,485
2.0,1/16/2018,"Do you like spending $100/pp or more for mediocre food and apathetic service? Cool, me neither. Unfortunately that's what we received at a recent special occasion dinner at Lure, which definitely charges a premium for 1. being in a prime SoHo location; 2. being filled with beautiful people; and 3. being a place where you probably come to be seen, rather than actually eat.We had a cramped table in the side room right by the bussing station, so servers were constantly dropping by with dirty dishes over our shoulders. Can't fault them for only having that table available (although we did make a reservation), but despite the constant stream of people, we only saw our server a handful of times.They do have a great cocktail and wine list, which we were happy to take advantage of. For food, we started with the tempura shrimp ($22) and the tuna tacos ($21). The shrimp were super crispy, came with a delicious spicy mayo, and were a good size for sharing between 2-3 people. The tacos (3 tiny tacos to an order) were just OK. While the tuna was definitely fresh, the dish didn't have a lot of other flavor.""Just OK"" seemed to be the theme for everything else we ordered, including a variety of sushi and rolls (fresh again, but not much else to say) and the slow baked halibut ($37). The fish was really juicy but again lacked flavor (and salt). The quinoa and veggies were well-cooked but just weren't compelling to eat.I'm no stranger to high-priced restaurants, but this was definitely an occasion where the food just didn't match up with the price tag. Combine that with lackluster service (our server made a comment like ""oh good, I can go home now"" as we handed over our check), and I'm not exactly compelled to visit again. Maybe for restaurant week, but in the meantime, there are plenty of other fish in the sea.",11,10,3,Marina S.,"Brooklyn, NY",391,374,935

5.0,1/8/2018,"What a surprise! The restaurant is located below street level, the restaurant sign is just above eye level on the corner of the bldg. Upon entry you have basically stepped into to a yacht/boat style setting. We had a reservation for 3 at 5:30 and were guided to a wobbly table somewhat in the middle of the floor. I addressed the table and asked for a booth since many of them were open and was told that they were all reserved. NOTE: If you want a booth, make a note to your reservation of that so they can accommodate. I believe our waiter came over and we advised that the Maitre d' was supposed to be helping us, he pretty much disappeared. We later were approached by the manger who smoothed things over for us and fixed our table, after the delayed response from the Maitre d'. She/manager also ended up taking care of us for the rest of the evening and was very knowledgeable and super friendly, which was a plus. Great managerial skills! We ordered the Crispy Calamari and the Tuna Tacos, both exceptionally good! Drinks were the Mas Vintage, definitely a guy drink that hits the spot! The Big Apple, very good and the Humming Bird, very refreshing. Main entrees were the Classic Lobster Roll, cause the birthday girl really wanted the Salt & Vinegar Chips, cooked to perfection and taste! Miso Glazed Salmon, the best and the veggies were surprisingly good, not a veggie person. Lastly was the Nori Crusted Tuna, the garlic rice was the show stopper but the medium seared Tuna was like butter! For desert, which I don't normally do but in this case I am glad we ordered. The lime cheesecake was silken heaven, with a side of Coconut ice cream. The Apple Pie for two, the crumb is by far the best with a side of Rum ice cream, simple pleasure, was a perfect end to a perfect meal with good company.

2.0,11/9/2017,"Positives: The ambiance and decor is truly unique - the wood paneling and round cubby windows are designed to make the diner feel as if they are inside a boat.  The theme goes well with the fact that it's a seafood restaurant.  Negatives: The food is generally good but overpriced for portion and many of the reviews said this already but I actually dismissed it as opinions of cheap people (I was wrong).  Dinner was $408 (before tip) for two woman and a 1-year old and and included wine - not egregious for NYC seafood. We started off with the $135 Royale seafood tower .  There was so much disappointment regarding this tower, compounded by lack of communication.  The first is that this tower is supposed to come with 5 crab claws  and 5 king crab legs.  The waiter failed to tell us that they were completely out of both varieties  but sometimes that happens because the kitchen doesn't communicate that to the wait staff, which is more a management issue rather than wait service issue.  So instead of telling us, they just added on 4 more cocktail shrimp to fill the space.  We would not have ordered the tower if we knew the crab claws/king crab was out.  It also became clear that they were not going to say anything unless we knew to bring up the issue.  So when we brought it up, the waiter asked ""what do you think is fair to replace the crab claws and legs?"" as if it is my job to determine this.  I asked him to bring out what the kitchen thought was fair.  They brought out one piece of lobster and one lobster claw.  I don't think this was a comparable trade but whatever.  The second is that the tower is already supposed to include 1 pound of lobster, which it did not.  I eat lobster often and know how much 1-3 lbs look like, and this included one chunk which we gave to the 10-year old.  It was that little, not enough to even cut to share and definitely not a lb.  This is the same piece they brought out to ""replace"" the missing 10 pieces of crab claws and king crab legs.  I felt jipped but decided to roll with it (things happen). The last thing about the tower - it comes with 2 seafood salads that but it's just the older fish they are combining with a heavy vinegar dressing to get rid of and as a way to to jazz up the tower (we didn't eat after the initial taste bites).   Lastly, I asked about the size of the sashimi pieces since they sell it by the piece ($7) and it was described by finger gesturing and verbally that it's a normal piece of sashimi so we ordered 6 pieces for the table and only 2 slices were as described and the other 4 were the skinny little pieces they used to prop up the other 2 bigger pieces.  That was $42.  I could have gotten a sashimi platter for $44 that from other tables, looked more generous in size.  So the lesson is - don't order sashimi by the each, order a whole plate.  But the topper is that we had ordered the sparkling rose from the ""by glass"" wine menu which should have been $18 glass but he brought some other sparkling rose (NOT on the glass menu) that was $38/glass.   How do you automatically default to a more expensive sparkling rose than is the second item on the ""wine by the glass"" menu???Summary: Definitely not worth the prices, in both portion/size and their mistakes.  Seafood is generally mediocre, you're better off at even Dockers.",0,0,0,Autumn S.,"New York, NY",2,29,0

Our server Brandon, a tall Asian man, provided us with service beyond our expectations He consistently asked us how we were doing also catered to our every need.. The food may take some time to come out, but it is not an unusual wait time. The quality of their oysters and little neck clams were superb and my partner and I would consider it being a top-tier level of seafood. We were very happy with our service and the amount of care they put into everything.

2.0,8/29/2017,"As prices of fine wine is skyrocketing, I find that although Somms are becoming more and more important; they are becoming more and more inexperienced. Being on the Winery's mail list of Peter Michael and Aubert; I explained to the Somm that I enjoy the Burgundian styled Napa Chardonnay like P.Michael and Aubert specifically the rich characters of old vined Belle Cote Vineyard or Ma Belle Fille of Peter Michael or Aubert's Lauren Vineyard however explained that I also despise the styles of the La Carriere. Now Peter Michael makes several chardonnays from their property including a leaner but more sour and acidic styled La Carriere. Only one P.M on their list was La Carriere meaning that of all the options; Cuvee Indigene, Belle Cote, Ma Belle, Carriere, Mon Plaisir, rare Point Rouge, the Somm chose the Carriere and possibly favored it most. Unfortunately it was the lean, acidic and sour chardonnay I'd despise most amongst the collection. So she turns me to a familiar Burgundy that was nearly twice as expensive ($300 vs $180), and tasted in the style of Peter Michael's La Carriere. So yet Another failed Somm that cannot differentiate the difference of micro-climate. Perhaps they didn't get to try all vineyards of Peter Michael's Chardonnay Productions and didn't know what I was explaining, however; an experienced Somm will know the simple fact that what tastes good to you is not for everyone.

Three of us shared the house salad of greens with cucumber, crispy shallots in a dijon vinegrette, shrimp tempura appetizer with a spicy mayo and black sesame seeds, the lobster croutons along with 2 sushi rolls: shrimp tempura and spicy scallop.Everything was absolutely delicious. The salad was very simple and a little over priced at $15 for what you get, but still yummy. The stars were the lobster croutons that tasted like mini lobster rolls on crispy toast(almost no mayo which I liked) and the shrimp tempura appetizer. Both were so so so good. I didn't try the spicy scallop roll, but the shrimp tempura roll with cucumber was tasty.We finished the meal with the fresh peaches and sorbet dessert along with the mini ice cream sandwiches. While the sorbet was light and perfect for a summer day, the peaches were not ripe. Needless to say, we didn't eat much of that dessert. But those mini ice cream sandwiches were a dream. They were more like mini chipwiches. My favorites are as follows: chocolate chip, strawberry shortcake, s'mores and birthday cake with sprinkles.

The interior is clearly designed to resemble the interior of a boat/yacht.  There's plenty of bar real estate both at the main bar to the left as you walk in and at the Oyster bars in the back. Food:  Food was awesome!  Everything I tasted was exceptional.  Had the Edamame, 4 of the Kushi with Jalapeño Ponzu oysters, the Miso glazed Salmon, and the tempura shrimp - No complaints about any of the food items.  The oysters were awesome, although they sound as if they might be spicy, there weren't at all.  The salmon was cooked to perfection, nice smoky, grill flavor to it.  Everything was bursting with flavors that were virgin to me.  I loved the originality of the food.  Service:  Service was awesome.  The lady who waited on my father and I was exemplary.  You could've have asked for more from a server.  The second our water was semi-low was there immediately to refill.  The moment we finished an item, she was there to clear the plates away.  I know this SHOULD be standard operating procedure at all restaurants, but many establishments fall short.

My husband was treating on Mother's Day. We came into the city simply to have weekend for ourselves to celebrate first year in motherhood. I didn't order a drink and because of this our server seemed to be let down. Obviously because a higher check average would lead to bigger tip. So I got a bad vibe already from beginning. So my husband and I went ahead and ordered apps. Our apps came they were decent and so I ordered a cup of tea which never arrived. So we ordered our sushi...I went with miso salmon roll figuring it would be delicious like the entree meal. Sushi comes out and I noticed it had a sauce on it that wasn't listed on menu. The server was kind to let me know sushi was raw , which is obvious,,,but....not that it was drenched in wasabi sauce...I can't handle spicy! I appreciate that server took the sushi back and took it off bill....but....would've been nice to know this roll tastes nothing like the miso salmon dinner!! She also goofed and gave my husband sushi instead of sashimi. So by this point my husband was frustrated and this ruined the night. I give this restaurant two stars because the 1.5 I really want to give rounds up. The restaurant was beautiful inside. But was very hot when we first were seated. Also manager walked by our table twice and didn't even check to see that we weren't satisfied. At one point it felt like ages since we'd seen server but time goes by slower sometimes in situations like that where we were upset and frustrated.

We started with one of the specials of the night, which was some sort of raw scallop appetizer. The scallop was buttery with the consistency of a firm jelly topped with a light sauce, and I loved it. For my entree, I went with a sweet potato ravioli topped with a lobster sauce. It wasn't as seafood-forward as I could've gone but it was delicious, and the sauce paired nicely with the sweet potato. We also ordered a side of lobster mac and cheese, which was less impressive compared to everything else.Since their menu appears to change seasonally, I'd love to come back to try new dishes. Sure this place would be a hit for any seafood lover.",0,1,0,Christina F.,"Brooklyn, NY",95,289,11

3.0,7/25/2017,"Great service, great vibe. Food was fair, Sea Urchin pasta was a total disappointment as it lacked any urchin flavor, Octopus app was ok. Excellent Salmon Skin Handroll (best we have had anywhere), grilled Shrimp freebie at the beginning of the meal was a nice touch simply grilled, and the Alaskan King Crab legs were cooked nicely and were good with the drawn butter (the Citrus Beurre Blanc that came with it was bitter and simply didn't work, needs to be re-invented). Oyster sampler was fun but the Kumamotos with Wasabi leaf were far too salty (losing the wonderful creaminess of the west coast oysters), and the Bluepoints with Caviar and Vodka lacked flavor (I have had Oysters with Stoli Raz and Wasabi tobiko that paired very well), Liked the Pineapple Relish and Jalapeno Ponzu with the other two oyster sets.

1.0,7/23/2017,"I started this Yelp account specifically to review this place. I've been to Lure on many occasions during lunch time and was usually impressed with the food and service so I decided to go on a Saturday afternoon with a friend to show them great food in a nautical themed setting. Completely and utterly disappointment with the food and service would be an understatement. We arrived 10 minutes before the end of the brunch service, so they had a transitional dining service/ menu called ""late lunch"". The great hostess told us this upfront and presented us with the late lunch menu and we thought it was up to par. However as soon as she seated us, the experience went downhill. We ordered a few things from the menu which were fine for the most part but the waiter was terrible. He came by TWICE and from that point on I had to chase down other servers to assist with ordering since our designated waiter seemed to intentionally steer clear of our table which was weird and was only magnified by the fact that the restaurant was sparsely populated with diners. I'm African American and my dining companion was a white woman and while I wouldn't ever think that would be the reason for the poor service, in this case that might just very well be true. Additionally, we ordered calamari and it was not good. That's fine but we had a full plate of untouched calamari sitting at the table for 10 mins that was 98% untouched and while we sat there, the waiter still completely ignored our table. I finally had to get his attention in one of his ignored stroll bys to get the bill and he proceeded to do so but never once asked us how the service was, how we liked the food or anything else.

3.0,7/18/2017,"Eating oysters and drinking champagne on a yacht sounded like the most extravagant thing I could do to celebrate my birthday. So I did that in a restaurant that looks like a yacht.I made reservations for Saturday 7 pm about 2-3 weeks in advance. When we arrived, we were seated immediately, right behind the hostess stand. Lots of foot traffic and didn't feel intimate. I was envious of the little wooden rooms on the side of the dining room-- would recommend requesting those for a special occasion.The room is indeed impressive. I spent some time living in Soho and used to pass this and imagine all of the beautiful people inside eating lobster, so this didn't quite live up to my expectations though. The crowd was touristy which made the decor feel more gimmicky. I saw quite a few kids.The wine list is just nuts. Decent breadth of selection, but bottles start at $60. We went with a Jean-Noel Gagnard Cremant de Bourgogne, which is a sparkling wine made from pinot noir. Mark up is about 2x. Wine service was good.For starters, we had Blue Point oysters, calamari, and steak tartare. The oysters-- wow. We picked the cheapest ones but they were awesome. A couple of my companions had never enjoyed oysters before and they're now believers. The calamari was pretty standard; came with a spicy and sweet red glaze. A crowd pleaser but not worth $18 for sure. And the steak tartare was great quality, so we had some converts in our party to raw beef as well. Plating was messy on all of these.For my entree I had branzino a la plancha. Great fish with a crispy skin. Strong sides of carrot and fennel in a creamy and tangy sauce.Companions had nori crusted tuna (weird texture, did not like), miso glazed salmon (decent but have had better, sides were basic), and sea urchin bucatini (wonderful pasta with lots of crab, but no recognizable sea urchin). I don't think a single one, even mine, justified the $36-39 price tag.We also had a side of lobster mac and cheese, and though there were a decent amount of lobster chunks, the cheese was pretty plain. Ordering lobster mac is an opportunity for a restaurant to knock it out of the park, but I wasn't impressed.Tallying it up, I'm not sure how it wound up being such an expensive dinner, at nearly $100 a person. Overall, many of the dishes were good, not great. I've had similar dishes elsewhere for half the price (yes, in New York). Service was fine but didn't feel special. For the prices they're charging, I expected much higher quality food or a much more magical experience. I got my birthday oysters but I wouldn't say that this lived up to my expectations. Come here on an expense account or skip it.",3,2,1,Liz S.,"New York, NY",952,772,1843

The ambiance is cool, just wish the music selection wasn't left up to a staffer with 'MF DOOM' pandora radio station.We were there as a party of 3 to dine casually on a Saturday Evening and boy you get greeted by frizzy haired unprofessional hostess'. Okay, she's just a hostess. Next our first waiter asked us if we wanted drinks/water. No introduction, no name, nothing. Okay cool. Our waitress then comes over, doesn't introduce herself just wants to know what we want to drink. Feeling a bit pressured we went with an bottle of wine. Their selection is GREAT. The sommelier was top notch. Overall our food experience was not great. Their crab cake is weak. All filler no jumbo lump crab meat for the price tag of $28. Oysters were superbly fresh. Our entrees were hit and miss. The halibut is heavenly, cooked to perfection but sides lacked flavor/seasoning. Upon every encounter with the wait staff they seemed numb and dead inside. We were hardly done with dinner then all of a sudden the check was placed on our table. The restaurant was NOT packed nor was there a wait. No fair well, nor thank you upon exit. Not the way service should be. I understand some waiters might hate their jobs, but damn what a mistake coming here. Go elsewhere for a better experience. This place is not worth the $300 price tag for dinner. P.S., the music selection was atrocious for the kind of environment we were in. They played MF DOOM, Drake, Whitney Houston, and Future???

1.0,7/1/2017,I have never been so disgusted by food and service that I felt compelled to share this photo with you. First if you're looking for good crispy rice don't go here! The fish is not fresh and for $19 you only got three pieces.  Go across the street to Mercer kitchen the original restaurant that invented salmon over crispy rice and you get five pieces of the best fish you have ever had for $19.I ordered the shumai and there were pieces of a Brillo pad in my food.Not only was the manager not apologetic she was like no big deal it's just Brillo. She offered me any dish I wanted instead and when I ordered a small appetizer she actually charged me for it. When I said something about the charge she was incredibly rude.Many years ago I too worked in the restaurant industry and when things happen that tarnish the food you are supposed to go above and beyond to make sure that the customer like me doesn't go online and post the photo. Back in my day I would've offered a bottle of champagne and comped at least three appetizers. The idea is to make them happy that there was a screw up with the food because it's an opportunity to show off your exemplary service.,3,0,0,Eleonora S.,"Manhattan, NY",343,6,2

We had the crispy rice sushi which had lot of rice and just a drop of the sushi on top; the crab cake - i was very excited about it, I love crab cakes but when they brought out i was so disappointed, it was breaded, fried and flavorless; tuna - a tiny tuna steak sliced in to 3 pieces on a bed of rice - fresh fish, however again flavorless and so tiny it almost got lost in the rice which turned out to be tasty, the best one out of them all I would say was the grilled octopus.

3.0,5/8/2017,"The ambiance and interior is beautiful. It feels like you're dining on a yacht. But my opinion is this place is exorbitantly expensive for no reason. Average entree ranges from mid-$20 to $50. Appetizers go up to mid-$20's. Soup and salads are $16. Specialty rolls range from $16-$22. This is probably a place better for restaurant week, since this is one of those places where you'll spend a lot but still be hungry afterwards.Instead of bread you get a basket of salt and vinegar chips. Those were delicious, but for a table of 5 people, we got a really tiny basket of chips. We should have at least gotten two tiny baskets.I got the King Crab California specialty roll (Alaskan king crab, cucumber, avocado, tobiko, topped with shredded Alaskan king crab). It was delicious, but extremely small. The roll was $16 for 8 tiny pieces, so I'm basically paying $2 a piece. If you compare to Luke's Lobster, you get like 3 times as much lobster meat for roughly the same price. Don't eat the roll with soy sauce. It'll ruin the crab flavor. Another person in my group did get the actual lobster roll which came with chips and slaw for $30. At Luke's lobster you can get pretty much the same thing, maybe more lobster meat too, for $20. Albeit the presentation isn't as nice.You're probably paying more for the ambiance and the possibility of a celebrity sighting than for the actual tastiness of the food itself. The desserts did look delicious though. Another person in my group got the Cookies N' Cream which looked great.

The chicken paillard sandwich was really good. It had mozzarella cheese, roasted peppers, and it was just perfect. The lobster roll was really delicious too.

While we waited we checked out the interior which is designed to look like you're in the hull of a boat. Great attention to detail. There are portholes for windows and even the floor looks like it came right off an old boat. There's a nice looking bar at the front of the house, but we didn't get a drink because it was packed with 2-3 layers of people and I figured we'll wait to be seated.After just 30 minutes we were seated at the clam bar. At first I didn't really like the idea of sitting at a bar, but the seats were comfortable and we got to watch the clam plates and other small dishes being arranged in front of us which was cool. The guys at the bar even gave us some complimentary deviled eggs which tasted very good. In fact, this particular location is very secluded and quieter than the rest of the restaurant so if I had to pick I'd definitely sit here again.My girlfriend ordered the ""Deluxe"" plate which included lobster, a variety of clams, tuna tartare,  and crab claws. Everything tasted very fresh and delicious.I ordered a spicy tuna roll and the burger. Was impressed by both dishes and ""fresh"" kept being the word that came up. The burger was juicy and already halved. We ended up taking the fries home because we were stuffed.Our waitress was attentive and always made sure our glasses were full. Offered recommendations and answered my girlfriend's questions about where a particular clam was from.It's not very cheap, but it is an expensive location and I didn't get that snooty feel of other restaurants in the area.

5.0,2/10/2017,"The Bash Burger is a winner! Despite almost no salt or pepper, the patty is wonderful. A pressed layer of bacon, pickles, and some kind of veggie tapanade is only millimeters thick, but adds tons of flavor. I ate the 2 onion rings separate from the burger. Their light and flaky execution stayed in my mouth for hours; a problem for bystanders but a going-away present for me. The side of French Fries was below average, but so what. I also had the ""Hudson Float"", which was a solid champagne cocktail, neither too sweet nor too sour. Having liked their burger so much, I returned to Lure during the 2017 winter Restaurant Week. My dinner meal started with a run-of-the-mill clam chowder soup. It ramped up quickly however, with a main course of Nori-crusted tuna with garlic rice. As advertised, the skin of seasonings crackled my tastebuds, and the garlic rice had a wonderful citrus bite. As good as this dish was though, the next was at an even higher level. The panna cotta with lingonberry compote was the best of the many desserts I had during this R.W. fortnight. The panna cotta itself was sweet and firm. Yet the lingonberries simultaneously swerved the dish towards tartness. It's rare to be completely satisfied on both counts.

2.0,1/28/2017,"If you, like me, lived in New York for the majority of the last 2 decades, then you know Soho is fairly well known for having sort of good, not great, restaurants.  Lure Fishbar is one of them. Tucked in the basement of a great building in a pretty cool spot, this room is a handsome room.  Nice spacious seating, big wooden tables, very nice hostesses greet you. There is a nice table in the dining room with a variety of newspapers laid out for your perusal. Can't say anything bad about the space.  The food and service is simply not as good as you want it to be.  It's sort of the Mel's Diner of mid high end dining. They have every kind of food on the menu, and they do it all ok.  just ok.  They have breakfast and lunch and dinner and seafood and burgers and sandwiches and at brunch they have eggs and omelettes and cinnamon buns and sushi, and dim sum (huh?).  Their sushi rice is too cold. The pot stickers not cooked enough.  Cinnamon bun looked unreal, lobster frittata very delicious. Service was not high end, waitress was annoying, highly ignorant to what was important and continually asking us if we wanted more drinks. No, just because we had a sip of a Bloody doesn't mean you should ask if we want another. Every seven minutes. Maybe check on our food, bring our food, then ask. duh. And the food took forever.

We then waited, and waited until about 20 mins later when the manager came over and took our drink order and food order. Took another 20-25 mins just for one cocktail to get to the table. Which is hard to understand when there was maybe 10% of the tables filled. Waiters, waitresses and bus boys constantly walking around looking busy but not stopping at one table to serve anyone. I watched multiple people be seated and go through the same thing.

Pretty tiring if you order both in the same meal (also, not super creative). The calimari is re-fried. The shrimp appetizer isn't bad and is a bit fishy. The buffalo chicken lollipops were tasty (easily the best thing we ate that night, which is odd, given this is a fishbar). Either New Yorkers have forgotten what good, fresh seafood tastes like, or half of these reviews are written by people who are crazy.

While it was probability too early to enjoy the fatty oysters, it was never too late to have a fulfilling brunch.I opted for their signature crab meat omelette, with tomato dices, avocado slices filled in the middle. Really loved their omelette as it was cooked tender and soft; while still maintained its chewy texture. The potato dices were also well seasoned. My cousin enjoyed his cinnamon buns too.I would love to return and have a taste on their renown shrimp cocktail, and of course, the oysters.

We ordered the SHELLFISH PLATEAUX ROYALE, which in retrospect did not seem worth as it was over-priced, and although the seafood was fresh, it did not seem high quality. We also had the CIOPPINO, a striped bass dish, and the NORI CRUSTED TUNA. The cioppino tasted a little off and was very very bitter. There were no complaints about the bass dish, and lastly although the flavor of the tuna was good, I think having the nori crust ruins the texture of the tuna and was overall not a very good dish. As for the service, I was really disappointed for how we were treated by our waiter. I'm not sure if we had too many questions about the menu or what, but I could see our waiter visibly deflate whenever we called him over.

That changed all of a sudden when we got bought by a 200 person company which was a recent acquisition of a 20000 person company. Big fish eats medium fish eats small fish, that's the way of life. Anyway, given the size of our company, this was an extremely joyous occasion and, on short notice, our company's administrative assistant and myself were tasked with locating a place to have a private dinner for everyone who would come on extremely short notice (like 48 hours.)They have set menus for large private parties. You select from a list of appetizers, a list of entrees, and a list of desserts. You can add raw bar (clams, oysters, etc) or a sushi platter for a certain amount, and for a larger certain amount, you can add both. Whatever you get is then served family style in the private room across long, banquet-style tables.The sushi was pretty forgettable; the raw bar was nice. The hot selections were generally awesome, though I would skip the roast chicken. Having them family style is weird; there's even a beef burger option for the entree served family style, which I was sort of confused about.Our server was really great and honestly, was great at plying happy people to order more booze and get even happier. We never had need for anything. If money is no object, I think Lure Fishbar is a great option for private occasions.

I came here with a friend after a sample sale specifically because they offered. 1,000 points on OpenTable, the hostesses were not the friendliest but my server in the bar area which has happy hour was great. Their cocktails are kind of odd but for $10, I guess it was alright. We stuck to $6 Brooklyn Lager afterwards. Their happy hour oysters were great and I could tell it was a bit better than the dollar oysters around the city. It's 6 for $12 here. We also ordered the anchovy toast, in my opinion it wasn't enough anchovies but still very good. It was a huge toast cut up in three pieces. Flavorful and delicious.

I got the lobster fritata, which was like a pizza with small bits of lobster about 8"" in diameter. It was again, pretty good, but it did not knock my socks off. My boyfriend got an omelet with bacon, which looked just okay too (three star food quality). The inside, however, is stunning. It has gorgeous wood accents, clean paint, and is decorated to look like you're inside the captain's quarters of a yacht. The bar is made of the same rich wood, and there are really cool, large beams across the ceiling. One thing I was disappointed by is the service. For a city of fast-moving, fast-talking urbanites, the waiter was like a turtle! I had to flag him down twice!  Our lunch which we intended to take about an hour, took about an hour and forty minutes! You would think they would be working to get more people in and out to keep up the business...Anyway, Lure Fishbar is a neat place to duck into in SOHO, but don't expect a quick lunch or very extraordinary food.",0,1,0,Tiffany P.,"Downers Grove, IL",376,285,884

The sushi rolls are quite American in taste, that is with flavor given by sources rather than the pure flavor of the fish. Again suspect that raw material, the fish, is not very high quality, even though its fresh. The signature crispy is made up of too much rice which drown the taste of seafood.

4.0,10/22/2016,"I had never heard of or even noticed Lure Fishbar before, but when a friend was visiting from out of town she found and suggested it and I was amazed- it's so cool! As everyone else says, it is designed to look like the interior of a yacht which makes the ambiance really amazing. We had a 10:00pm reservation and ordered drinks at the bar in the meantime while we waited. They have an innovative cocktail list- but I went for whiskey. The bar was packed but we were still served quickly, which is always appreciated. Our table was ready about 5-6 minutes past our reservation time, which isn't a big deal for me personally and the hostess apologized for the delay. We ordered the crab cakes and the lobster croutons to share and they were sooo good. Just enough food for a group of 3 people to snack on before our entrees. The entrees were amazing too. I had the nori crusted tuna- incredible and I highly recommend! My friend had the miso salmon and my boyfriend had the lobster roll- which was definitely the fanciest lobster roll I've seen. I'm from New England so I know my lobster- and I had more than a few bites of his meal and it was delicious. The only cons- the music playlist was weird. It didn't really have a theme- going from top 40 to jazz to EDM style music which I found odd. The service could've been better, especially considering how expensive the menu is. The food and ambiance made up for it for the most part, but something to be wary of in the future. Just not as attentive as I would have liked. Overall, great dining experience and I will certainly come back to give it another try and check out more of their delicious menu.",2,1,3,Maria B.,"Brooklyn, NY",175,361,7

Our server was sweet and helpful throughout the meal.For the food, we got the shrimp tempura appetizer and the tuna tartare.

The tuna tartare was nice and fresh with a few pieces of crostini on the side to add a bit of crunch. For the entree, we got the nori crusted tuna and the sushi platter. The tuna was nicely cooked and the crust was good, but the rice it came on was delicious! perfectly seasoned and a great accompaniment to the fish. The sushi too was nice and fresh.Overall, the food was well done, but one complaint is that the fish was somewhat lacking depth in flavor.

3.0,9/25/2016,"20%+ tip for subpar service?  Let me explain.  This was my fourth visit to Lure so i knew what to expect. We had a 7pm reservation on a Saturday evening and were seated at the reservation time. Our waitress arrived shortly after being seated taking the water and beverage orders and mentioning the daily specials as well as a couple of changes in the menu preparations since the restaurant menu is transitioning between seasons. I ordered the Watermelon Salad to start and the Halibut entree. The Halibut, our server cautioned, was now prepared with Carrots, Fennel, and lemon. My dining partner had the Cioppino and Snapper. My diing partner said the Cioppino was excellent. The Watermelon Salad was overly ambitious. It consisted of dry and unsweet watermelon with feta cheese, radish, and the strongest onions imaginable along with some type of hot pepper. The result was an overly spicy dish with a combination of ingredients that didn't mesh. It was a nice try, but needs major tweeking. My dining partner's Snapper was good. My Halibut, once I got over the initial shock of the tartness of the lemon, was exceptional! The fennel seemed to have been marinaded in lemon juice and the dish was amazingly refreshing while still having the flavor of the fresh Halibut. This dish is definitely a welcome addition to the menu. Dessert was the Apple something (I don't recall the name) which was very good. Now for the service. Shortly after our orders were taken, our waitress was assigned an insane number of patrons to serve. Two of the tables that she was assigned to, I would call ""Celebrity"" tables because at one, at least, I recognized a well known ""celebrity"". At both tables, incomplete parties not only were allowed to sit at the table, but also order food. This became an incredible burden on our waitress, since the new arrivals at the two tables needed to order food and drinks that was out of sync with the rest of the members of the dining party at the tables. Our waitress, Claudia according to the check, handled it in stride. In all honesty, if I were serving tables, I would have never been able to handle that much stress and keep a pleasant attitude. At one point, she must have been serving over 35 people. Yes, the service slowed considerably, but there were no lapses and nothing was ever forgotten. Not only did Claudia take the order, but she also cleared the table. More importantly, the ""Celebrity Table"" guests were treated with the same respect as the the other tables Claudia was serving; no better, no worse, which is admirable and the reason that she earned her 20%+ tip despite some long waits.  Overall, an amibitious chef who is hit or miss with creations but more hit than miss. Servers, at least ours, who are professional and try their best to please. (but they need to understand where the fork and knife should be placed on the table). Not sure about the management however. Our server had an excessive number of tables to serve. Yes, she did an exceptional job doing so but the servers could have been allocated differently to make the work load more balanced. One other thing... as good as the food was, the prices really are too high, about 15% too high.",0,0,0,Bob G.,"JAMAICA, NY",17,213,400

When we got there, we were welcomed and greeted by a host, which was nice. When my team's partner (aka one of the owners of the company) picked up the wine list, we were told that the sommeliere was female and she would be coming over soon. We were waiting, and when my partner was looking, a man who we later presumed to be a head waiter or something (since he was wearing a suit) came to our table. When my partner asked him the difference between our top two choices, he said ""how come you get to choose the wine?"" which given the circumstances was clearly referring to the fact that why isn't the male director next to her in charge? Regardless of his intention, this statement is absolutely unacceptable. Even after our director stepped in to say that she has every right to order, the head waiter provided no apology of any sort.

5.0,8/20/2016,"Always a top top quality restaurant for fish and seafood. It was the second time here both during restaurant week and it was unbelievably delicious.The ingredients and products they used are so fresh that you can taste the whole history of the food your are eating.Every little thing we had was superb. For the appetizers we got the salmon tartare that I love. Any tartare for me is a must and this one doesn't fail. Even the jalapeño inside of it is perfect. It comes with a couple of crostini that makes the perfect combination for a crunchy and delicious seafood toast. But the best was the shrimp tempura. It's been a while since I don't eat this kind of flavor. AMAZING!! It's definitely a must and something you'll never regret. I could eat a bucket of these crunchy, tender, spicy and super tasteful shrimps. A must get, again.Following the well prepared starters we obviously continued with the fish options. It's a fish bar!!The seared tuna and glazed salmon were really great. I had many great seafood in my life so my bar is set pretty high. Anyway, these two dishes were good and in a very professional way. Even the plating was beautiful. The Tuna was super fresh and tender. I ask all my fish dishes rare so I can taste the real fish and it's not overcooked or lacks of flavor. I really liked the rub and searing on the Tuna. Super crusty but it melts on your mouth. The accompaniment is rice with asparagus which pairs very good with fish. It also comes with a garlic Alioli to give that extra kick. For my palate, it didn't have enough salt so I asked for soy sauce. That was a very good move.The salmon was the best and again, how much better can be a salmon. Plenty of salmon in my world. I guess that's why I'm always against the current :-PSuper well prepared and lightly cooked. Ordering rare fish makes soooo much difference. It was like eating premium sashimi. Melts in your mouth with tons of flavor. The side was superb too: snow Peas or some kind of peas with spinach and mushrooms. Who would have thought that simple side had so many flavors?Finally the dessert arrived (you have to order everything upfront with Restaurant Week).The mmmmmousse... Just remembering it I get my mouth full of saliva. Comes with caramel toffee and meringue with some killer pecans. Loved it!And the orange semolina cake which was my choice as always. I always get the ""odd"" dessert since everyone seems to go for the safe choice like chocolate mousse, lava cake or cheesecake in all restaurants. I'm pretty tired of the usual, common, without imagination desserts. So I'm never wrong about the choice. Those are the desserts the chefs put all their imagination and creativity so you'll get the real gourmet deal. Lucky me I always share everything so I got a little bit of mousse to ;-)The orange semolina cake comes with a loooot of stuff and lot of love. Blueberries on top with a reduction that is also spread on the plate. A scoop of very good I've cream with some garnish of nut crums. Delish!A must eat place in the middle of Soho.

For the appetizer, the oysters and shrimps tasted pretty good and fresh. The sushi combo tasted alright. The lobster fra diavolo (squid ink tagliatelle with shrimp, calamari and spicy tomato) tasted delicious even though it was a bit too spicy for me.

3.0,8/3/2016,"I came here for restaurant week lunch with a friend today. I ordered the salmon tartare appetizer, sushi main course, and chocolate mousse dessert. She ordered the shrimp tempura appetizer, roast chicken main course, and the cake dessert.The salmon tartare was decent. But we both enjoyed the shrimp tempura much more. There was a nice serving of shrimps and the flavors were good. Next our main courses arrived. My sushi platter left a lot to be desired. The nigiri were some of the smallest pieces of fish that I have ever seen. The yellowtail tuna and scallion roll was ok--nothing to write home about. I literally ate my entire plate in about 5 minutes and that's with me pacing myself. My friend's roasted chicken dish was delicious. It was with two large pieces of chicken that were very well seasoned and cooked to perfection. The chicken was tender and moist. For dessert, we both LOVED the caramel chocolate mousse that was topped with pecans and sea salt. Her dessert was good too but it was overshadowed by the chocolate mousse.If I could do this meal all over again, I would order the shrimp tempura, roasted chicken (sounds so boring but it was very good), and chocolate mousse.",1,1,1,Cin C.,"Fort Lee, NJ",231,244,1007
5.0,8/3/2016,"Went for RW menu (again) and got the raw bar tasting (good but overcooked shrimp). I had the lobster fra diavolo but since it said spicy tomato sauce, I asked the waitress to check with the kitchen if they can make a sauce that's not spicy. She did and said it's doable so i ordered it. It still came spicy but she offered to remake it without sauce. I decided to go with it and omg it was good. Even my friend, who ordered the same dish but without alterations, said mine was better. Shrimp was still uncooked but 2 pieces of sizable lobster (one was the claw) and the pasta itself was great. I had the chocolate mousse and my friend ordered the gelato, which has raspberry, lychee/passion fruist, and pina colada. All were good.Great service. Loud place.

Now to the food, we came here during restaurant week, for starters we had the crispy shrimp tempura and lobster bisque soup-- YUM YUM.. ORGASMIC, all of the above. For entrees my boyfriend had the miso glazed salmon, i on the hand, had the nori crusted tuna which was on the restaurant week menu.. both dishes were average and could have been better, seeing as we had high expectations based on how amazing the starters were, I have to say we were disappointed.

4.0,6/22/2016,"Let me state this up front. Food is pretty good, but the value is poor. Small portions and expensive prices. Still, the food ranges from good to great.The decor is a little odd, it's supposed to replicate the inside of a yacht. It's quirky, the sushi bar is totally out of place, and the whole concept is admittedly a little tacky, but it oddly works for me. The atmosphere can certainly feel luxurious if you're willing to patronize it a bit.The service leaves a bit to be desired. I've read some horror stories from my fellow reviewers, and thankfully every time I was here I never experienced any problems. But I have suffered from slow service and impersonal/unenthusiastic hosts and waiters. However, I haven't experienced anything that would make me want to drop a 1 star review or stop coming here altogether.As mentioned earlier, the food here is pretty damn good. I've been here a few times and have been able to try a small variety of the dishes. Here are some of my favorites:Lobster Bisque: Velvety, creamy, rich, and indulgent. Upon first sip, it is immediately apparent how much time and labor goes into Lure Fishbar's lobster bisque. The deep and multidimensional flavor of lobster delivered in a perfectly silky bisque. It's a product only achievable from hours (maybe even days) of preparation and reducing lobster shells. I love the touch of cognac in here to give it that extra complexity.Raw Oysters: Their raw bar is always a sure hit. I especially love their oysters. Flawlessly shucked, and perfectly sourced. Their oysters (no matter the region) always deliver.Miso Glazed Salmon: A tried and true recipe that is executed beautifully. Umami rich, sweet, salty, and satisfying. What makes Lure's Miso Glazed Salmon stand out is the quality of the fish. The salmon is fresh, flakey, and melt in your mouth fatty. It's served with sugar snap peas, and shiitake mushrooms.Nori Crusted Tuna: This is an intricate dish that is deeply gratifying. Beautiful fresh tuna, crusted with nori and cooked rare. Served over a crispy garlic fried rice and Chinese broccoli. Paired with a bright citrus emulsion. It's an orchestra of textures and flavors that all pop and compete with each other, but never seem to overpower one another. I've had some other items that are definitely passable ESPECIALLY at Lure's price tag. They include:Sushi: It's quality fish, but it's prepared in the most lackluster and unimaginative ways. If you want sushi, and you're already paying top dollar go to a real sushi bar. There's plenty of them in New York City.Warm Chocolate Cake: Puerile. Honestly, just walk across the street to Georgetown Cupcake, you'll get a better cake experience for much cheaper.Lingonberry Panna Cotta: This was actually kind of good. But, too pedestrian to justify the cost of admission.Lure Fishbar has been around since 2004, despite the hefty price tag they're still putting out quality food that's worth a try. It's also worth mentioning, they regularly participate in NYC Restaurant Weeks in both summer and winter. If you can't pay full price (which I totally understand), it might be rewarding to check them out during Restaurant Week.",3,2,2,Jonathan N.,"New York, NY",72,66,361

4.0,6/16/2016,"Had a nice evening there. We weren't super hungry so only ate the miso glazed salmon, the grilled beef and one sushi roll. I really enjoyed the salmon, it was super tasty BUT, I have to say that it was TINY. I didn't mind it as I wasn't really hungry but it's much smaller than the usual salmon size I get in the city. For $35 I'd expect a little more generosity. My friends liked their dishes as well. We also ordered the ice cream sandwiches and the apple pie for dessert which were both nice but nothing more. The place is nice, the waitress was also nice, her helpers were a little bit too passionate offering to clear our table with the deserts half eaten and the pouring water without asking a second after we ordered sparkling water from the waitress. Also, the place is extremely loud. I met with two old friends I didn't see for a long time and having a conversation was hard and unpleasant. The place was far from being full, I guess they put so much efforts in the great design and forgot the acoustics...Overall it was a nice experience, nothing special though.

1.0,6/16/2016,"Wish we had the chance to try the food here.  We had to leave after waiting 25 minutes past our reservation time as the restaurant basically sat everyone who came after us first. I get that we were there early but the entire bar which was very crowded at 830 cleared out and we were never approached by any staff here for over an hour. Our reservation was at 9pm on a Wednesday night. The girls working at the front of this restaurant are extremely rude and not qualified. When we walked in, the tall blonde girl Enta? Was too busy flirting with one of the customers to even greet us. There was another girl who was standing next to her who could have said HELLO  to us but she was just too busy hoping her friend gets this man that she also didn't even acknowledge us. Girls... if u r at ur job, do ur job. I'm sure the restaurant isn't paying u for ur matchmaking opportunities.Then we went to the very packed bar. The bartender was serving a group of his friend heineken. So my brother in law ordered a Heineken as well but the bartender was like... oh it's not on our menu but.... well give it to u. Why the hell do u have beer that's not on ur menu? Maybe they have their own special friend menu or something but place was shady. Then the bartender splashes water all over my sisters back and instead of apology, he says it's just water and hands her a towel. Wtf is up with the attitude here? After waiting around, I looked around the restaurant and it felt as though we were the only group without a white person in our group. There was a group next to us (of course white) who was approached and one of the girls up front came to them to say their table will be ready soon. This couple came at 915. We came at 830 for our 9 pm reservation. So I approached these girls at the front and told them I feel racially targeted here. Of course she says it is not about race but she laughed at me when I turned my back... witnessed by my sister. Girls its 2016... get over urselves.We walked out after getting water splashed and will never come back to this place. And I really hope the management reads this review so they understand what kind of staff they are dealing with. Look at most of ur recent reviews... if you want to sustain this restaurant, get girls who are there for their work and get bartenders who will serve what's on the menu instead of doing their own kind of business.",3,0,0,Monica S.,"Lakewood, WA",2,55,38

1.0,6/12/2016,"I am so sad to write this review, because we used to LOVE Lure soooo much. But, something has changed in the last year or so, and it has become a DISASTER. First of all the prices have exploded to astronomical amounts, and in NO WAY is this price increase warranted. They used to be a fun, quality place where we frequently enjoyed brunch and were familiar with the long standing staff. But, sadly the last couple of times we went, the service was sub par, some of the newer bar staff not even knowing how to make drinks on the menu, and if they did, the drinks were not made as well as they used to be. But, sadly, the last time we went there was the DEAL BREAKER for us. I ordered a new drink from the menu, it was made w/shaved ice. Imagine my horror to see that the shaved ice they used in my drink was the same shaved ice they used to store many bottles of sauces and seasonings. Additionally, there was a DIRTY DISH TOWEL in that ice as well. I almost became ill when i realized I had been drinking this drink that was poisoned with who knows HOW MUCH bacteria. We spoke to the bar tender and a manager. Actually threatened to call the health department. It really was a sad, sad visit to Lure. Certainly our last time there.

3.0,6/10/2016,"3.5* I rounded down because it's overpriced for the quality. My very first lobster roll. I knew it would be pricey but I wanted the best. For a little over $30, you will get a tiny classic lobster roll that is very disappointing. $30 for lobster, cold bread, and a bit of sauce?!?! Does it look like students with loans that decided to invest in this meal were happy campers? We also ordered a sushi roll, and shrimp spring roll. I loved the shrimp spring rolls. They were crispy and the stuffing was perfect. As for the sushi roll, I didn't expect much but it was still good! I appreciated the minimal amount of rice on these rolls. Our meal was served with fresh chips and we were both not junk food fans so we didn't touch the chips. To end our meal, we had the the mocha ice cream sandwich and smores ice cream sandwich.

After sitting we got the water right the way but the waitress took 15 minutes to come to our table.We had a few drinks are the bar and didn't order a lot food.

5.0,5/9/2016,"Came here the other night for dinner with out of town family members and I have to say we had a marvelous time!!  The service, meal and ambiance were just perfect.To start, our party had clam chowder and tuna tataki.  The serving of clam chowder was HUGE.  You could have put your face in the bowl.  The consistency of the chowder was thick and there were whole clams in the chowder.  So many places serve their clam chowder with chopped or minced clams so it was surprising to see this place used whole clams.   I think the use of whole clams vs minced makes a lot of difference-- as in the chowder with hint of clams vs actual clam chowder.  My parents agreed.  They said the clam chowder was one of the best they had. My tuna tataki was delicious, too.  I love yuzu and I could definitely taste it in the dressing/marinade over the tuna.For entree, we had the wasabi crusted halibut, lobster roll, and the bronzino.  I was wavering between the halibut and bronzino but ended up getting the latter as my mom opted to get the halibut.  She raved about her dish, which was quite surprising as she is more of a complainer and hardly ever compliments dishes she didn't cook herself.  The halibut was presented quite nicely with the pan seared filet of halibut resting on bed of veges (I think I saw broccoli amongst them).  I would have taken a bit of her fish if it weren't for the fact I was busy chowing down on my bronzino.  The bronzino was also a pan seared filet, and it rested on bed of root vegetables.  The veges were nicely cooked (not too soft) with an amazing sauce (don't quite know what sauce it was).  The only complaint I had was that the bronzino skin was a bit too salty-- but otherwise, the dish was near perfection.  My dad had the lobster roll on an open faced brioche roll.  The lobster roll didn't look doused in mayonaise and my dad absolutely loved it.  He said it was better than the lobster rolls he had up in Boston.  Service here was impeccable.  The waitstaff was constantly over to fill our water glasses and our server was sweet and attentive.  I noticed there was a high number of waitstaff present in the dining area.  Granted, we were there on a Saturday night, but the ratio of waitstaff to customers looked something like 1 to 2.  This place definitely prides itself in its service and food.  It's good to know I can expect a service level of those fancy midtown restaurants in a trendy downtown location!",0,0,0,gwen L.,"New York, NY",3,137,0

So cute.We sat and the drinks were fantastic, and the giant ball ice cubes are fed my favorite!

I started with the kale Caesar salad for my app and the filet mignon for dinner, both were fresh and delicious, the filet was cooked to a PERFECT medium rare and the soy miso butter it came with was absolutely divine. Other star dishes at the table were the Crispy Asian Snapper for two - gorgeous presentation and WOW the flavor! Even I enjoyed it and I don't eat snapper. The sea urchin bucatini was a great heavier option, and miso glazed salmon.For apps my dining guests loved the tuna tataki, hamachi poke, all sushi, and the oysters.

3.0,4/19/2016,"Food was good, no question about it. But let's get to the fun part, aka the part where the restaurant took a nosedive straight to the 7th level of food review hell.First of all, we've been here for an hour and a half and have already run through the playlist twice. Classic selections from Drake, Drake, Lil' Wayne, 2014 Tyga, and Drake blasted loud and over and over again. We weren't the only ones to notice; as I lived vicariously through another table (my boyfriend and I no longer talk at the dinner table) I overheard one of the girls say how she's heard these songs already. Their master-plan of repeating white-friendly rap music was foiled as white people have become more hood-phisticated through the years in a desperate bid to become ""ratchet"".Ironically one of the songs on heavy repeat was called ""Gas Pedal"", a relatively shy little banger from late 2013 that my boyfriend made me turn off on a road trip through Texas because it was ""too fucking repetitive and stupid"". Well there's no escaping it now, motherfucker! Muahaha...Second and final, our server Max from the show ""Catfish""s superbly atrocious service was so slow that I actually developed a metric created to measure the effectiveness of waiters: cost per step, in where:Cost = total cost of bill, or average tip percentage time bill (player's choice pre- or post- tax)Step = total number of steps a waiter takes in front of your table, loosely indicating the amount of time he served your table or the amount of opportunity you had to flag him down for service.The lower the cost per step, the more efficient and enjoyable service. I don't have a benchmark average on which to compare this guy to, but considering I had enough time to come up with and write down this formula, while still at dinner, I'd say the service was pretty fucking bad.The food though, food was superb.Now on Drake song #9 for the night...",4,5,3,Shelley H.,"New York, NY",90,6,0

Our food was not very good and the service is less than poor. The only time our waitress came to see if we needed anything was when we had to call her over which took way to long. My son and husband order the fish tower and what came was not was promised on the menu. At one point I went to the bathroom and our waitress and managers were chatting in the back having fun time. Vegetables came after entree were completed. Tempura in the sushi was cold. It was way to much money for the experience. We will never step foot in the Lure again!

Great decision since we enjoyed some really well crafted cocktails. Had a perfectly executed rye manhattan then the bartender (i forgot his name some older Mexican guy kudos!) spoke some game about his custom spicy chile cocktail so i obliged and it was fantastic - smoky and spicy that i almost wanted to cancel our table and eat at the bar. Whatever that was should be on the cocktail list!Finally after a few swigs we were ushered to our table and im glad i was decked out in Ralph since the ambiance was definitely going for yacht moored in Saint-Tropez so i had me all pumped up for whats next. I told our fabulous, always grinning and bubbly server (Maggie) to suggest food based on the cocktails and wine that we were ordering. I know its usually the reverse but she was more than willing to oblige. As usual i over ordered and with her suggestion we laid it out to 3 courses so my group pretty much tried Lure's greatest hits. Started with plump briny east coast oysters, tartare and bubbly, proceeded with a mid course of stuffed lobster, the crispy shrimp and a fab Sauvignon blanc then individual entrees and mine was the sea bass and uh, a gin and tonic (i know).. i must say one of the best seafood plates ive had in a while.

1.0,3/26/2016,"By far the worst management in New York City. Our meals were going fine...good wine, good appetizers. Our entrees came and everyone got started. About thirty seconds after the runner dropped off our food, our waiter came by with the obligatory ""how is everything?"" Now, no person with courtesy and common sense would say ""it's been half a minute since it landed on the table so I have no idea. Come back in ten and I should have my full review printed, double spaced with a bibliography in APA style."" No, we just said ""fine so far,"" because that's what normal people say. If there was an issue, of course we would let him know. My brother ordered the Stuffed Lobster (market price $75). Nearly every part of the lobster (meat, claws, legs) was charred BLACK from their grille. Not just a little but heavy heavy char--so much so that I could smell it from across our booth. Needless to say, the meat, the stuffing, everything tasted heavily like charcoal and nothing tasted like lobster. My brother thought maybe it was his opinion so each of us at the table tried a bit to check. It was very clear that the dish was burnt and inedible. No one wants to eat something that tastes like you've licked a heavily used grille grate. We politely let the waiter know, and the manager (Katie Dean) came over. Instead of apologizing, she proceeded to interrogate my brother as to why he didn't bring this up when the waiter initially came by to check on us, and insisted that was the way the dish was supposed to taste. To which my brother asked if there was a time limit on informing the waiter know that something was wrong. She pressed on with the fact that we already said everything was find, and was completely unapologetic and actually downright combative. She brought over one half of one deviled egg and a single tiny shrimp to compensate for the abortion of a $75 stuffed lobster dinner that was clearly intended for a very hungry person. If food was ever capable of being passive aggressive, it was last night. Think about this. What if you were having dinner, and your waiter asks how everything is and of course you say fine? Right after he/she leaves, you find your chicken is uncooked in the center, or a bug in your salad, or that the bottom of the rest of your pork loin is burnt beyond repair--Has the statute of limitations passed? Is there even a statute of limitations?! What world are we living in?!Our waiter was great, very apologetic and took everything in stride. The manager (Katie Dean) is working in the wrong industry or the wrong position. She does not have the personality nor business acumen to face customers directly.

3.0,3/14/2016,"Used to be the old Canteen which I adored. Place was a bit quiet but steadily got hopping on a Sunday around 7. What sometimes puzzles me about hosts/esses is the initial approach. I think I speak for all customers when I say that a warm ( not gratuitous) smile and an open manner are appreciated upon first impact. It sets a tone and whomever you are in the world--it is simply a humanitarian gesture to figuratively embrace someone openly when you are hosting them for a meal.The two ladies in their mid 20's frostily received us at the desk as if we had arrived with news of impending doom. Honey it isn't that bad! Once seated, you feel as though you are in a stylized 1950's cruise ship lounge decorated by Judy Jetson.  Not altogether unpleasant, but there's no escaping.Everybody is well meaning here, I truly believe that. Many Soldiers (floor managers) roaming about without a clue as to which tables are on what course.Captains/GM's nowhere to be found and this is why the chaos and service flounders. The cooks and chef are to be applauded as the food was delicious! Bravo! Our server disappeared completely. Poof! The check would have been $100-200 higher had he been around to take some orders.

1.0,3/5/2016,"Food was off the charts great, but the service was so horrendous I could swear I was being punk'd.  First, I expect to wait for a table, even with reservations, but when we went to the bar to get a pre-dinner drink, the bartender not only ignored us, but then she was rude when she finally served us. As one example, she gave us tastes of the two Pinot Noirs, and then walked away without taking our selection for about 10 minutes.  But alas, this was just a sample of things to come.When we were finally seated, the table was wobbly. The hostess made a valiant attempt to fix it, but she could not. She said she would send somebody to fix the table. Nobody ever came. We fixed it ourselves.  When the waiter came over we ordered our appetizers and told him we would order our entrées when when he came back with the appetizers. We ordered a very large selection of various shellfish as apps, including one of each kind of oyster they served. The shellfish it was dropped on our table with the description of which oysters were which. At some clam shack, maybe that's OK, but at $4.50 per oyster, explain to us what we are eating.  To make matters worse, the waiter never came back to take our entrée order.  We had completely finished the shellfish appetizers and sitting at our table with nothing by the time we were able to flag down our waiter and remind him that we still want to do water entrée (30 minutes earlier). To the waiters credit, he reported the disaster to be Captain, who came over and told us that he would personally supervise our service.  The entrées were delivered, again by someone else, and when I discovered that the eel sushi I had ordered was in fact sea urchin, I just started laughing.  Oh, and we had ordered a cocktail while waiting for the entrees, which came just after we finished the entrees. Surprisingly, despite the comedy of errors, they comped nothing. The couple next to us were also having a rough go of it, and were similarly both horrified and amused.A ridiculously disappointing experience to what is otherwise a wonderful place.",2,2,0,Jeffrey Z.,"Manhattan, NY",3,19,2

The burger was pretty awesome - I was surprised to find such a good burger in a seafood restaurant. A juicy patty cooked to a nice medium (per our request), soft but durable bun, 2 crispy onion rings perched on top, and a side of perfect fries. It is a top contender - no complaints.Unfortunately, I can't say the same about the miso glazed salmon ($35). The salmon was overcooked (we ordered medium), not flavorful (even a tad fishy), no crispy skin (my favorite part of seared fish), and a very small portion (4-5 oz where the standard is closer to 6-8 oz). The huge portion of vegetables was well-prepared, still snappy. No starch to anchor the dish. An overpriced healthy plate, very underwhelming... considering this is a seafood restaurant. My biggest issue here was the service - the hostess looked peeved when we asked to be seated at a different table NOT under a spotlight (in the nearly empty restaurant). Why were we not offered the ""complimentary bread and chips"" that our neighboring tables had? Waiters were difficult to flag down, yet were overbearing trying to clear our plates (3 servers in 2 min asked to take our plate away, which we were still nibbling on.)

All the ingredients were fresh. The highlights were the salmon tartare and the nori crusted tuna.

We had an issue with seating and almost left but were convinced to stay by the management and staff. We are just your everyday former New Yorkers who now live in Jersey - we figured this was a standard city scene but were convinced to stay and had the best meal we have had in as long as we can remember. The restaurant had models, musicians, and actors as guests but they treated us as if we were the most important guests there because they truly wanted to make everything right. The food was exquisite, we had a seafood tower and the oysters were amazing - each was topped with a different flavor: wasabi, pineapple, caviar, jalapeno. Sushi was great, and the ginger was fresh and the fish was perfect. We had sake with the sushi, a first for me and I don't think I can eat sushi without proper sake ever again. For dinner my husband had a great Nori Crusted Tuna and I had the Sea Urchin Bucatini which to me, was spicy, savory, and umami -  probably the best thing I have ever eaten. You know when in life you meet nice people who want to do the best they can? They are nice just because they are truly good people? That was our experience tonight.

4.0,2/5/2016,"I would recommend a reservation, but still expect a wait, they are really popular especially during dinner time. Once you are seated though, service is pretty quick despite the craziness that is going on. Tables are also relatively close to one another, so this might not be the best place to conduct or discuss secret business matters of any sorts but if you are all just about the food and no fishy business (no pun intended) then by all means, put this on your must-try list! The food here is applaudable. Serving sizes a bit tiny for the $$$ they charging but worth every mouthful. I had doubts about their sushi because this place didn't seem 'Asian' enough but rest assure my friend, it has my stamp of approval (for what its worth). Fresh fish, perfect size, they don't over stuff the roll with rice. The seared tuna...Oh EM JEEZ. Seared to perfection just the way you ask for it, the little bed of rice was just the right amount but it was so good you wish they could just make you a whole bowl of that thing. Oysters and cocktail shrimp all very fresh. The lobster ravioli also SO good. Only four pieces though sadly. The squid ink pasta, words just can't describe. Overall great ambiance, great service, a little noisy during dinner so might not be too intimate but you'll be stuffing your face with food anyways, no time for chit chatting.",1,0,0,Irene H.,"Boston, MA",390,251,286

My girlfriend chose the seafood platter, noori crusted tuna with rice and the chocolate cake!

I went with friends and we began with the tuna tartar and shrimp tempura appetizers. They loved their tuna and I was obsessed with the shrimp! The spicy mayo had a great kick to it, and I could've eaten another bowl of it! I got the seared tuna for the main course, and it was so amazing I'm still thinking about it 3 hours later. It was cooked to perfection (rare), and the garlic rice was a perfect side. I'm not a huge dessert person, but the lingonberry vanilla panna cotta was super light and I enjoyed it! My friends loved the chocolate cake (especially my gluten free friend because it is flourless!) I loved this place and will definitely be coming back!!Only complaint is that we had a super loud and obnoxious couple sitting by us, and we could barely hear each other speak.

4.0,2/4/2016,"Love Lure Fishbar!I found myself here twice during NYC Winter Restaurant Week and the food and service were excellent both times.The first time I was here, we arrived a few mins prior to our reservation (6:30PM) and were seated immediately. The second time we came to an 8:30PM reservation and had to wait about 15mins to be seated. This visit was noticeably busier (last week of Restaurant Week) and we were lucky enough to see Ramona from Real Housewives of N.Y.C! (haha)For the food - I loved the raw appetizer (4 oysters, 2 shrimp) Oysters were some of the freshest I've ever had. The accompanying vinegar is delicious and I loved the mayo type sauce it came with, too. The miso salmon was great, but the portion left a little to be desired. The noricrusted tuna was tastier than the salmon, but the rice was barely 1/2 cup - they could do a little better in terms of portions.Overall, each time I was here the waiters were attentive (but not to a fault) and the vibe was sexy, warm and friendly.

The place itself reminds me of being in a boat and overall the food was nicely presented and well worth it. My only gripe is that the service here is too overbearing when we did not need service - like they fill your water a lot and they reorganize your table with no reason to. While we waited at least 30 minutes for our food and took 10 minutes to collect our check. We had to eventually start flagging down the waiters because they were taking too long.",1,1,2,Johnson L.,"Manhattan, NY",352,587,179
3.0,2/4/2016,"If you have motion-sickness and have never been on a boat before and want to experience the boat atmosphere without stepping onto one, this is a great place to be.  I felt like i was in a boat, the entire restaurant resembled the inside of a boat, from the port hole doors to the sun-roof type dimly lit windows on the ceiling and keep in mind this is in the basement.  Whoever designed it, did a very good job to replicate the boat experience.  It is quite noisy in here but not to the point you cannot have a conversation.  The lighting is not that great, meaning it's pretty dark in here.  Another great aspect is you will not be rushed out of this place, we had a party of four and choose the restaurant week menu and it took us almost two hours to get out of here, they take their time in bringing us everything.  So if you are really hungry, you may faint waiting for your food.  There is no seating unless everyone in your party is present.  We ordered various items from the restaurant week menu.  Lure raw bar tasting (2 east coast oysters, 2 west coast oysters, 2 shrimp dipping sauces) - oysters were pretty small, tasted very fresh, the 2 shrimp were overcooked.  Lobster fra diavolo ($10 supplement)(squid ink tagliatelle, shrimp, calamari, spicy tomato) - the spicy tomato sauce was really good, very flavorful, the shrimp and lobster was a bit overcooked.   miso glazed salmon (sugar snap pease, shitake mushrooms, toasted sesame seeds) - pretty regular dish, salmon was juicy.  sushi combo (6 pieces of sushi & 1 maki roll) - we had one order with yellowtail & scallion, and another with a special roll - king crab California supplement $6, having sushi here is kind of unusual, but the fish tasted pretty fresh.  Warm chocolate cake (chambord sauce, white snow, vanilla bean ice cream) - just didn't fit my palette, flourless cake tasted weird and there was not much chocolate oozing out from the center.  Service was good, the guy checked up on his often.Glance at the regular menu indicated much more options at much higher price points.  Overall, the atmosphere and decor were awesome, but the restaurant week food was just ok.",1,0,0,Bakchun K.,"New York, NY",75,518,1152

5.0,2/2/2016,This place is a little hidden in soho because of the scaffolding and it's kind of underground ish. I've been here before for restaurant week a few years back but was totally wowed this time around. Came here with the family and everything was on point. Speaking purely about the restaurant week lunch menu here!The salmon tartare was good although if you're not a fan of horseradish you're better off going with one of the soups. The new england clam chowder was by far my favorite! the clams were really big! the lobster bisque will be an additional few dollars but worth it if you like lobster a bit on the salty side.The tuna and salmon entrees were a hit. The tuna was cooked medium rare and beautifully seared with a crunch outside. The fried rice had veggies in it and was light but flavorful. The salmon was cooked wonderfully with a bed of green beans and mushrooms. The dessert was a molten chocolate which was perfect with ice-cream.

4.0,1/29/2016,"**WINTER 2016 RESTAURANT WEEK REVIEW**Three friends and I decided to try out this place for restaurant week. We managed to nab a 6:30 resso for a Monday night (be sure to reserve fast for RW because spots fill up fast - at least through Open Table)! To start, I went with the Lure Raw Bar sampler, which included 2 east coast oysters, 2 west coast oysters, and two shrimp cocktail. I don't remember which oyster was which but one coast was about half the size of the opposite coast. Both tasted fresh though. The shrimp was just okay - tasted pretty similar to the shrimp cocktail rings that you would get from your local supermarket.For my main, I decided on the nori-crusted tuna with garlic fried rice. This was amazing! The tuna was cooked perfectly (I asked for rare), and the nori crust was crispy. It was a nice contrast to the soft tuna meat. The garlic fried rice was great as well. There were chopped up string beans in there so that added a nice crunch to it. The ""citrus emulsion"" they dabbed the plates with tasted more like spicy mayo so I stayed away from that. My only complaint is that I wish there was more tuna. Portions were pretty small. I'm not sure if this is specific to restaurant week or Lure Fishbar itself.For dessert, I wanted something refreshing, so I chose the sorbet selection. This was one scoop each of raspberry, passion fruit, and coconut. The raspberry was sweet but not overly so. I'm not a huge fan of passion fruit but it wasn't bad. I even finished it. But the coconut really just trumped the other two. You could really taste the coconut in it and again, it wasn't too sweet. If you close your eyes while eating it, for a few seconds, you might feel like you've been transported to a tropical island.Overall, everything was great - including the service. I don't usually try a restaurant week more than once but maybe I'll come back next year. Heck, I might even come back when it's not restaurant week. Wouldn't mind checking out that oyster happy hour!",2,2,2,Mel T.,"New York, NY",444,1319,3267
5.0,1/29/2016,"Submerged deep below the glamour and hustle of SoHo, Lure offers a colorful array of edible treasures that appeals to all senses.The moment we sat down, we were greeted with the flash fried crispy sushi rice topped off with jalapeño uni. The flavors were bombastic and tastefully refined. It's the equivalent of fireworks going off in your mouth. Phenomenal. Upon asking our server (a very nice Eastern European gentleman) for recommendations, he took a cursory look at his notepad, and confidently replied, ""OK, trust me with this. I will order you a few of my favorites."" We gave him our complete trust and got treated like royalty in return. The waiter certainly knew his stuff!First came the Lure House Roll. Crunchy and spicy, just the way I like a good roll. Then the Hell Fire with a sauce so devilishly divine, that I almost got up to ask Chef for the recipe. The dressed oysters also served as a nice palate cleanser before we moved onto our entrées; the miso glazed salmon, nori crusted tuna, side of king trumpet mushrooms and roasted cauliflowers. All very exquisite in presentation, and delightful in flavor. I seriously couldn't get enough. Helmed by the world renowned Josh Capon, the menu appeals to practically every foodie demographic imaginable. There were even some amazing vegetarian options (the table right next to us were raving and hollering about the beet salad all night). The cocktails were also top notch. Chill'n Mexico has a nice bite of paprika that keeps you invigorated and more alert with each sip.Chris Rock was also dining a few tables down from us.  At the end of the night. We feasted on the ice cream sandwiches, and the manager (Devon?) came to check to see how we were doing. He was extremely genuine and made us feel very special.

I ordered it medium rare but it still seemed dry to me. Everyone enjoyed their meal , but I think I would have been disappointed had not ordered off the restaurant week menu.

2.0,1/24/2016,"EH hem....Let's see, where to start?Restaurant week in NYC!  SWEET!  A chance to sample some of the city's more upscale-style restaurants at a more affordable price.A friend selected this restaurant based on reviews and having long wanting to visit this restaurant.We made reservations for Sunday at 4pm (via open table and stated that it was for restaurant week) with intentions of enjoying the dinner special.  After we were seated we were informed that the restaurant week special was not available until 5pm.  Note: it did not state this on the website or on the online menu.  We asked the manager if they would accommodate us as this was not mentioned anywhere and we stated on the reservation that it was for restaurant week.  He did NOT meet this request oddly enough.  I mean really, it was 1 hour difference!  So we said we would leave and come back at 5 if there was availability.He then made the ""generous"" offer of allowing us the bar specials (which normally start at 5).  Fine we decided to stay and sit by the bar.  At the bar we ordered  6 oysters for 1.75/pc (standard) and the lobster croutons for $10.  The order consisted of four tiny, ~1 cm squares, of over seasoned lobster a top a piece of toast.  I do not recommend.When we were finally able to be seated we requested a bread basket.  Unfortunately, the bread truck was unable to make it and there was no bread available.  (I'll give them this since there was a snow storm the night before). The waitress then offered to bring us ""chips"" instead.  The chips were loaded with salt and vinegar.  Not a fan.Finally, we were able to order our meals.  We had the:Appetizers:--CRISPY SHRIMP TEMPURA: was a light, thinly crusted shrimp with a tasty red sauce, this was goodTUNA TARTAR: (Pickled Daikon, Avocado, Sea Urchin Vinaigrette) was just OKEntrees:--NORI CRUSTED TUNA  (Garlic Fried Rice, Broccoli, Citrus Emulsion) :  The tuna was well prepared and delicious however there was no broccoki and the rice was very undercooked--6 Pieces of Sushi & 1 Salmon & Avocado:  The sushi was very standard if not slightly sub par.  They served the salmon roll with browned avocado.  They should be ashamed of themselves for serving this!  Regardless of the fact that this was restaurant week, the regular price of these items are substantial.Dessert:--LINGONBERRY-VANILLA PANNA COTTA (Praline Crunch, Berry Marmalade, Dolce Chocolate)--WARM CHOCOLATE CAKE (Chambord Sauce, White Snow, Vanilla Bean Ice Cream)Both sdesserts were only just OKHonestly, for the proce of these items and the quality of the food I am SHOCKed that this place gets good reviews and is as busy as it is.I do not mind paying substantial money for a quality meal BUT I do mind paying any money for sub par food.Needless to say I will not be re-visiting this venue.  There is far better food in NYC!",6,3,1,Joey M.,"White Plains, NY",208,433,262
5.0,1/23/2016,"It was a spontaneous choice to stop by here on a Friday night. I was aiming to impress my friend with some good food as we had many things to talk about. I had to meet up in the Soho area and Lure Fishbar was very convenient for us in the almost 6 degrees farenheit weather. We strolled in without a reservation and they were wiling to accomodate a party of 2 without any waiting time. We were seated in the side dining room, which turned out to be perfect. It was quieter, brighter, more spacious, and private than the main dining room. I loved it. The host that walked us to the table was funny, personable and made me felt comfortable and welcomed to dine at Lure. My friend and I wasn't that hungry so we decided the RW menu would be the most suitable for us. We decided to share everything from starters to desserts. For starters, we had the clam chowder and the raw bar tasting. The clam chowder had a few pieces of littleneck clams and finely diced potatoes with some applewood smoked bacon in it. I prefer my soup saltier but it was good enough already that I thought about ordering one alc. I was in oyster heaven as I tried the oysters from east coast to west coast. The Kumamoto oyster was my favorite! It was mild, had the right amount of brine and so buttery. May I have 5 dozens of these please? The Kusshi oyster was my second favorite, very meaty and had a nice and smooth finish. I didn't care much for the shrimp or the dipping sauces. I like my oysters with just lemon please. The starters set a really high standard for me. I expected a lot from the entrees and desserts now. The entree and desserts did not come to par with the starters but still great! I don't like tuna or spicy tomato sauce but we went with the Nori Crusted Tuna and Lobster Squid Ink Tagliatelle. The tuna was cooked at the chef's recommendation and I think I'd have enjoyed it more at medium rare. My favorite part about it was the nori crust which tasted really well with the citrus sauce emulsion on the plate. The garlic fried rice was disappointing though. I don't expect a seafood restaurant to make good fried rice but the rice had no flavor to it, no garlic flavor, no ""fried"" goodness to it. The pasta had a $10 supplement to it. The way I see it is that, dishes with a supplement is something great the restaurant would like diners to try but it's hard to offer it at the budget at a restaurant week price. Again, I don't consume anything spicy nor do I enjoy red/tomato sauce. But this dish came in the right amount of sauce and spice where I was surprised that I enjoyed it so much. The squid ink tagliatelle was perfectly cooked and there was a nice portion of calamari in there. There were only a few pieces of shrimp and lobster and the lobster was borderline overcooked.Overall, good food, service, and atmosphere!",5,0,1,Carrie C.,"Brooklyn, NY",546,336,2421

The couple next to us did not order from the restaurant week menu and they seem to have gotten their food right away and their food looked really good. I can understand they rather treat regular customers better than restaurant week diners but that doesn't sit well with me. It should be first come first serve. And the whole point of having an event like restaurant week is to allow ppl who generally won't dine in such a place to come and see what it's all about. This is the first negative experience I had from a restaurant week place. I'm sure the food from their non-restaurant week menu is banging but I prb won't come back.

Our waiter was really helpful, and gave us plenty of suggestions. He came back often to check on us, which was impressive since the restaurant was packed with people the entire time we were there. AMBIANCE: The whole restaurant is beautiful, and there's an awesome wrap-around bar that I would love to come back and sit at for a cocktail and app sometime. It's pretty loud, but that's too be expected when it's so busy. It's got a nautical theme (obviously), and it feels like you're eating inside a fancy ship.FOOD: Wow. YES. My friend and I ordered the Grilled Octopus and the Tuna Tacos for appetizers. The portions were generous and they came out perfect. If you go here, you have to get the octopus. The char on the octopus was perfect, and the creamy garbanzo bean puree underneath had chorizo in it, which went really well and had just enough spice to bring out extra flavor in the octopus. The tuna tacos were delicious as well- crispy, warm taco shells and fresh tuna and avocado. Excellent.For the main course, my friend got a sushi roll that she loved, that the waiter had recommended. I would have tried it but I was too focused on my dish. I had the Nori encrusted Tuna. The waiter recommended that I order it rare, because its sushi grade and I'm glad I listened.

For my main course, I had the miso salmon glaze, and then the chocolate cake for dessert.

1.0,9/6/2015,"One star and that is for sheer ambience and how wonderful the waitress was.  For a restaurant with $38 entrees and $17 appetizers the quality of the food was poor. Tiny filets of halibut and branzino barely flavored or textured on sweet sauces of corn and a few market veggies.  No complex flavors at all, just sweet and fish. Look its aiight but very very mediocre for the price tag. The lobster croutons for $17 bucks were four TINY chewy flavorless ginger covered objects.  Texture for this should be crunchy and scrumptious not dry and elastic.  And the sushi overpriced.  This is a stunning looking restaurant but the quality of food is just SAD. We really wanted to like it!! Also the service is bumbling. There were a lot of free tables open on a Sat night, they sat us in a cramped corner and when we asked to move, two hostesses, two bussers and a waiter and a manager had to have a conference in front of us about it. They tried convincing us not to, then they agreed but said to wait until the table was ready....and then proceeded to stare at us for two minutes before the waitress waved us over and put us at ease.  We are not difficult people. $40 entrees in NYC merit quality not quantity and service needs to be pristine and accommodating not doubtful and weird.  Such a beautiful restaurant needs new ownership ASAP or an overhaul of the menu and the service.  Otherwise you get robbed to sit at the prettiest Denny's at sea.  And that's probably an insult to Denny's lol.

1.0,8/18/2015,"Unprofessional, crap place with awful service. Had some large Perez Hilton knock off circa 2000, who spoke little to no English, acting as if he was the some celebrity who couldn't be bothered. Sorry, you're wait staff - get over yourself.Went during NYC restaurant week - this, in my opinion, is a great time to check out if a restaurant really has good hospitality or not. Of course, at the Restaurant Week prices, there are bound to be some questionable patrons at the restaurant - thus, if, even then, when the tables are filled, the service is on point, that means that should I come here paying full price - the service is going to be even better. If that's the case, I will almost always go back to the restaurant sans restaurant week (contingent on the food in addition of course).Of course, my faux Perez waiter never learned etiquette and thus failed on all marks - no introduction, did not check on my table after ordering, took twenty minutes to flag down in between courses, and was too busy on Grindr looking for some 18 yo twink to bang who just moved to NYC from Idaho, thinking he had just met the disabled brother of the Prince of Liechtenstein. I digress. Of course, after a lengthy 90 minute 3 course meal, I called over someone who looked manager-esque but turned out to be some amateur assistant manager in a $50 suit from Burlington Coat Factory who'd just graduated from the College of Staten Island. After telling him the situation, he goes - ""well you shouldn't have come during restaurant week...we'll comp you one meal"".K, so the comp part was nice - but the passive aggressive ""you're poor because you're here during RW week"" was a major turn off - sorry you have to crawl back over the Verrazano to get home, but don't take that out on me. Meanwhile - the waiter had caught on to the fact that I was not happy, and proceeds to scowl while walking over with the check. Honey, no. You already have enough blemishes on your face to rival the surface of the moon - you don't need to add wrinkles to that also.Oh, and the food, forgot to mention - to be honest, not awful. But of course you can imagine my thoughts regarding this restaurant after having to endure potentially the worst service I've ever had in my life. I honestly don't remember what I ate because the service was that bad.Some woman at the front, probably the actual manager, was the only professional person I spoke to the entire time.

4.0,8/15/2015,"I want to start off by saying that in my experience, most waiters in popular places in soho come across with a ""too cool for school"" attitude. But not here. Everyone is very professional . Came here on a Friday night. It was definitely on the louder side but not to where it was obnoxious. It was a good amount of sound to get you in the weekend mindset. The place itself, as mentioned by everyone, is a really cool concept. It's a basement, but looks like the hull of a yacht rather than a subterranean dark hole with small windows (as many places in NYC tend to look like).The food was awesome, everything tasted the way it should, and the sushi menu perfectly straddled American rolls and Japanese rolls. I got the sushi dinner with one extra roll. Each piece of sushi was great, and the spicy tuna roll was great as well (minus the fact that they used farmed salmon, weird for a place that seems to pride itself on quality). The cocktails (well and otherwise) were $16. A bit much for a restaurant but what can you do?The service was great, food was great, location and venue is great. It would be 5 stars if the place was about 20% cheaper. Not because it's out of budget for most people here, but that's where I'd value the experience at (mostly based on food creativity, quality, and quantity).

I didn't have too much trouble to book a table. We were 4 and I had a table at 8:15 PM. When we arrive, I think the hostesses were a bit overwhelmed as a lot of people came in the restaurant at the same time. We waited our table for about 20 min which is something that I find a little bit annoying when you make a reservation. We were told to wait at the bar but the bar was crowded so we were just waiting in the way of the waiters, not so nice. In another less positive note, I find the place too loud. The music was way too high. We are in a restaurant, not a nightclub !So I just have these two little negative notes but for the rest, I am very satisfied by this restaurant. The service was nice, even if we didn't have the same waiter the whole time but whatever, they were both fine.Then comes the food. I had the crispy shrimp tempura because I saw on yelp that it was amazing amd I confirm, VERY GOOD ! A little bit spicy though. After, I had the miso glazed salmon. I asked it to be rare and it was cooked to perfection. Cooked on the outside and raw on the inside, just the way I love salmon ! The veggies coming with it are very good as well. And last, I took the Valrhona warm chocolate cake. I was a little bit disappointed when I saw that it was not melting inside but it was still really good. The banana ice cream was a nice add to the cake. It was also nice to have wines by the bottle which were not too pricey (between 36 and 45$) so we took a bottle of Chardonney without breaking the bank.Overall, it was a really nice evening spent with my girls eating some seafood/fish and I'm glad I waited to try this restaurant.

2.0,8/12/2015,"One of the few to offer restaurant week menu on the weekend for lunch. Not sure if it's because of the promotional period, service was non-existent. My husband and I sat for 20 mins before waving down a busboy to help us find our server. Apparently no one was assigned to our table so instead a random staff member came by to take our order. It was obvious he was in a hurry - he didn't introduce himself or acknowledge the fact that we'd been ignored since being seated. A terse - ""you guys ready to order?"" The food was okay - nothing outstanding or even remotely memorable. Shrimp tempura was overly dressed in spicy mayo, salmon tartare was a bit bland, Nori tuna and miso glazed salmon were both lukewarm when served (mass production fail), semi-freddo and chocolate cake - cruise quality aka mediocre. The best part of the whole meal was the bread - rolls with sweet butter. I thought it was strange that we had to request them even though they were complimentary.

4.0,8/10/2015,"If you haven't yet, make sure to stop at lure for 2015 nyc summer restaurant week! Came here with a group of 5 after scouring for the best looking restaurant week menus. We were seated promptly for our 8:30 reso, the place was bumping with a big bar and dining crowd. Really liked the galley design, felt like you were on a boat. Our server greeted us with a heavy foreign accent which was even a bit more challenging to understand with the loud club/ oldies mix loudly playing. Anyways onto food, for $38 prix fix I got the salmon tarter starter delicious sauces to dip in. The nori crusted tuna with garlic Chinese broccoli rice. The combination of the fish and rice together delivered great flavor. For desert went with the molten chocolate cake. This is my only complaint as it definitely wasn't molten and actually was very dense/ dry... Like it was overcooked. Skipped this as it just wasn't worth the calories. Service was good except the server did try to upsell us on a pricier bottle of wine than what was ordered. And by upsell I asked the Somalia why she was bringing a different bottle than what was ordered, surprise surprise our requested bottle was around.",0,0,0,Christina G.,"New York, NY",323,458,565

They were only participating Sun-Fri though, so don't come here for restaurant week on a Saturday.Anyway the whole boatlike decor is pretty swell. The clams/mussels appetizer is great, as is the shrimp one and the calamari one, and the clam chowder is good too... yeah we got 4 appetizers we were starving! Anyway, for the main course we got the fish dinner for two and while it was good, I liked the appetizers better.One thing of note, for a nice place the women's bathroom was a disaster area!

4.0,8/7/2015,"Came here for restaurant week for brunch on Sunday as part of restaurant week and it was a great experience! The interior is made to look like the inside of a ship. That alone was entertaining. The wait staff was amazing! No glass was ever without water. I don't believe any of them ever reached down to the half-way point. The food was fabulous! Unfortunately, I ordered the herb roasted chicken. Not that it was bad. It was very moist and flavorful! Probably one of the few places that actually know how to make it well. The bad part was that they had a seared tuna that was done perfectly and I was stealing pieces here and there from my friends! The salmon was pretty good, though parts of it were a bit on the well-done side, obviously at the thinner edges of the fish, so not really complaining, just an observation. The rest of the salmon melted in your mouth, it was that good. The crispy shrimp tempura was so good that it reminded me of something that I've had in authentic dim sum. Well done! As for the desserts, the vanilla bean blackberry semifreddo was the best part of the desserts, though most of my group ordered the valrhona warm chocolate cake. The banana cream and banana-toffee ice cream that came with the cake was great, but the cake itself was dense and tasted like some cheap piece of crap that you buy in the freezer of a local bodega that's been there for 5 years, at least. Not to mention that the cake wasn't warm when it arrived. So the only reason this place is getting 4-stars is because the dessert honestly tasted as though they really decided to go cheap on it. I'm sorry to say it, especially if it's something they actually made in house. (Maybe there wasn't enough baking powder in it?) Mind you, I don't blame them much. It is a Prix Fix menu after all and not their main source of revenue. Still, I hope that if you order it, you'll have better luck than we did. Enjoy!",1,0,0,Zack M.,"Brooklyn, NY",2,71,149

From previous experiences, lure is definitely one of the better options for the $38 restaurant week deal, they also had a special on wines for restaurant week which was nice.  We started with the crispy shrimp which was SO flavorful and the salmon tartare which was equally as delicious.  For our Mains we picked the salmon and tuna.  They never asked how we wanted the salmon which I found strange but the tuna.. SUCH a tasty crispy crust served with some ""fried rice"" was very good.  For dessert we had the warm chocolate cake which I thought was too dry but the banana ice cream was delicious !!

4.0,8/6/2015,"This review is for Summer 2015 Restaurant Week. I didn't make it here for Restaurant Week in Winter 2014, and had read this place is one of the best to go for restaurant week (the most bang for your buck). Made a reservation for two the night before and got lucky as there was one more spot open at 11:30am. DECOR/AMBIANCEI loved the layout and decor of the entire restaurant. It's located right below street level, making it feel like you're entering into a boat. It feels nautical and classy. There is a bar area and then tables and booths. Open space, good lighting. Noise level was moderate. I've been to many restaurants around brunch time and it always becomes so loud you can barely hear yourself talking. This place was not like that.FOODMy friend and I both opted for the prix fixe menu. We chose different items for each course so we could try more dishes. Overall, really solid, but did not EXCEED my expectations. I would say for $25 you get a decent amount of food of good quality. I wasn't wow'd so only 4 stars. The crispy shrimp tempura was not your usual tempura. We got about 7 large pieces of jumbo shrimp, that had a batter that was fried to perfection. Not too oily, but not dough-y either. Sauce and black sesame went great with it. Slight umami taste. They didn't have the salmon tartare and replaced it with tuna tartare which was disappointing, but still yummy. I think this appetizer needed some more seasoning. A bit bland and a bit fishy. Portions for both appetizers were, well, appetizer-sized.For entrees we got the miso glazed salmon and the nori crusted tuna. We got the salmon medium rare (as suggested by server) and it came out great. Tender and moist but not undercooked. Veggies that came along with the salmon were seasoned well. The salmon itself needed some more miso glaze in my opinion. Also would have been even better if there was more of a crust/crunch/char on the outside of the salmon. What was lacking in the salmon was made up for in the tuna. Rare on the inside and had a super crunchy, seasoned with a kick, crust. Mayo sauce paired great. Rice was a little undercooked. For dessert we got the Valrhona warm chocolate cake and the vanilla bean blackberry semifreddo. The warm chocolate cake was a miss because the cake wasn't warm. The ice cream was standard. I liked the semifreddo better. It was my first time having semifreddo (part ice cream part whipped cream) and the raspberry foam and fruit on the side went so well with the semifreddo. A refreshing way to end the meal. SERVICEThe restaurant could use some more friendly waiters. Our waiter was a bit brusque, just bordering on the edge of rude. He didn't let us finish saying our orders but would cut us off since it seemed like he knew what we wanted and was in a rush to just get it done. We didn't have to wait long between each course, which was great. But in the end, he came to get the check after we had paid and signed BEFORE we left the restaurant. I always think this is a very unprofessional move and makes the customer feel uncomfortable.",0,0,0,Sally Z.,"San Francisco, CA",450,109,157

3.0,8/3/2015,"RW Brunch Sunday 8/2/153.5 STARSPROS:- CRISPY SHRIMP TEMPURA {4.5 STARS} with spicy mayo and sesame seeds. Delicious. I loved the spicy mayo and shrimp is perfectly crispy.- HERB ROASTED CHICKEN {4.5 STARS} this was surprisingly very MOIST. Most places I have been to made the chicken pretty dry. This was the first time I had artichokes and I didn't really like it. It tasted kind of sour and chewy. I did however like their mash potatoes and spinach was pretty good. - Service was on point. Refilled our waters as needed. They wiped down our table more than necessary - 3 times from 3 different waiters when the table wasn't even dirty. I guess our table looked dirty as it was white and it was full of scratch marks on the table due to wear.THE OKAY:- TUNA TARTAR {2.5 STARS}- ehh tasting and very mushy. My favorite part was the avocado. I had better tartar elsewhere. (FYI - waitress said they changed the menu a bit, so instead of SALMON TARTAR they now offered TUNA TARTAR with avocado, and jalapenos & Clam Chowder instead)- MISO GLAZED SALMON (medium rare) {3.5 STARS} - Wasn't really medium rare when I got it. It was more like well done. Only 15-20% of the salmon was actually medium rare. The string beans were very old and stringy. The shiitake mushrooms were good.This was okay...CONS:- VANILLA BEAN-BLACKBERRY SEMIFREDDO {2 STARS} - Really nice presentation however I didn't really like the vanilla bean semifreddo - it tasted really airy - like whip cream. The only part I liked were roasted peaches (which are cut into fine pieces) and the bottom part of the semifreddo where there's a thin layer of cake soaked in vanilla sauce. - VALRHONA WARM CHOCOLATE CAKE {1 STAR} - my friend ordered this dessert and I tried some of it. I did not like banana toffee ice cream. It was CLOYINGLY SWEET - tasted like an overripe banana with super sweet toffee. The chocolate cake was DRY. Taste wise it was alright/passable. I really think they need to work on fixing their desserts. NOTE: AC is really high here, so ladies bring a cardigan or jacket with you.",0,0,0,Teresa C.,"New York, NY",156,471,1940

4.0,7/29/2015,"Yummy!!!! We had a reservation for noon this past Sunday and b/c we allotted some time for parking which we didn't need because we were super lucky and parked half a block away without circling!!!, we ended up getting there at 11:30am. They seated us right away and while there were only 2 tables when we sat down, it was 80% full by the time we left at 12:45. We had the restaurant week menu and the drinks. Neither of us drink so we focused on the food. We had a choice of tuna tartar, oysters and the amazing shrimp tempura. He got the tartar and I got the shrimp tempura. Both were delicious! we even used some of my spicy mayo on the tuna tartar - not needed but i love spicy anything. The portion didn't seem too big but it was actually the right amount ~5 shrimps total for mine and about 2inches diameter for the tuna tartar. Then for entree, I got the miso salmon (medium rare) and he got the nori aka seaweed crusted tuna (rare). the waiter suggested the recommended rareness and they were great. I loved the miso salmon - the medium rare reminded me of the lovely miso cod at morimoto. The salmon was melt in your mouth kind of softness and perfectly cooked. There was quite a bit of sugar snap peas and mushroom under the fish. The tuna came in 3 large rectangular piece. It was seared with a crispy nori crust on the outside and raw tuna on the inside. It's like eating a sashimi buffet! the garlic fried rice was meh, but who cares! the tuna was awesome~ For the dessert, i got the molten chocolate valrhona cake with banana ice cream with cocoa nibs under it. The ice cream went well with the slightly dense cake. I was a bit disappointed that there was no 'lava' chocolate coming out of it. Jean Georges does it better.  The bf got the semifreddo. I am not a fan of semifreddos in general - i find it confusing.. is it a mousse? it is ice cream? it's neither! He liked it but agreed that my chocolate cake was better. for $25, it was great value and they did not skimp on portion. We walked out feeling satisfied without the 'oh my god, i am going to throw up' feeling. Delicious food with fresh ingredients = happy me!

4.0,7/26/2015,"**this review is for Restaurant Week Summer 2015Wanna make it feel like yacht day with your personal chef without having to own a yacht or a personal chef? This is the place!TL; DR: the food was great. Plating was artfully and tastefully done. If you're here for restaurant week, I recommend the salmon tartare, the miso glazed salmon and any dessert options. I walked past this place once and noticed the carefully thought out interior decoration - nautical is the first word comes to mind. Friend picked this place for restaurant week and I didn't realize it was the same place I walked past until I walked in. As soon as I took the first step to walk downstairs into the restaurant as I would a subway stop, I felt like I was about to meet the captain of a yacht.APPETIZER: I would recommend the salmon tartare over the oysters in retrospect just because the avocado added SO much flavor to the dish itself. The sesame oil & mustard base dippings for the tartare were also delightful!ENTREE: Highly highly highly recommend the salmon & have it done as the chef would - medium rare. I normally like my salmon either complete raw or completely cooked but this dish caught me by surprise when the waiter mistakenly placed my friend's medium rare plate in front of me. SO GOOD! Fresh down to the last bite. The veggies that came along with the dish weren't as carefully treated but the plating more than made up for it. I would NOT order the sushi combo. I don't care how fresh the fish is, there is no excuse to pass nori crusted tuna or miso glazed salmon just for sushi! And don't even get me started on the tacos! No! Just go with the tuna or salmon!DESSERT: I'm not a sweets fan so everything seemed equally mediocre to me. The chocolate ice cream was pretty dark-chocolate-tasting and took me a few bites to get used to but I enjoyed it regardless. My whole party ordered everything on the dessert menu combined and we all cleared our plates aka you can't go wrong!PS Our waiter was great! One of our friends was running late a lot and they offered us their kitchen made salt & vinegar chips - so refreshing! It also tasted like it was cooked in some sort of fish oil!

You feel like your setting sail somewhere else. The food was fresh and presented very nicely. I had the salmon tartar, tuna and sorbet medley for my pre fix choices. My mom went with the shrimp tempura (was our fave) tuna and chocolate cake as her choices. The shrimp tempura were fried so correctly and the batter was delish. I could eat about 20 of those. My salmon was very tasty as well it came with a mustard or soy based sauce I used up all the soy sauce on my plate. The tuna was a nice portion size. 3 medallions and the crust was the star of the dish. It was the right amount of salt to compliment the tuna. My mother and I were very impressed. Our server Cody always had a smile when he came to our table and the hostesses were very happy to greet us as well. Will definitely be returning for after work cocktails or a fancy date.

Music was fantastic as well (I couldn't tell what it was but it sounded great). I had the miso glazed salmon and the blueberry compote cheesecake. I noted to my server that I was in a bit of a rush to get back to work, and he graciously took note of that. My salmon came out in less than 8 minutes, so I was very impressed.The salmon dish was beautiful. It had a nice sprinkling of sesame seeds on it and was nestled on a bed of snap peas and mushrooms. There was a ring of miso glaze surrounding the dish. The salmon was prepared perfectly - I asked for medium well and that is exactly what I got. The flavor of the miso had really sunk into the fish. I actually really liked the peas and mushrooms. Normally, I'm not a fan of snap peas, but the ""pea"" flavor was nicely masked by the miso. Quality dish.The cheesecake was a recommendation by my server. I'm glad I listened to him. Delicious. Not too heavy of a portion and the crust was delightful. There was also a citrus accent on top of the blueberry, which surprised me pleasantly. The flavors went very well together.

We had a table for 6 in the rear of the main dining room, with a nice view of the bar area. There is also a cool sushi counter in the back of the restaurant, and a private room (or two). The polished wood and seafaring decorations really give the impression that you are on a beautiful yacht for the duration of your meal. We began our lunch with some cocktails and then started ordering bottles of rose wine to accompany the main course and dessert. Instead of bread, the table received warm homemade potato chips...so delicious! For appetizers, we went with a variety of sushi (the Crispy Rice and Tuna was to die for) and some traditional starters (the Crispy Calamari was not my favorite part of the meal, but did have a unique spicy taste appreciated by the table). I tried the Combo Basket for my entrée, which included a Lobster Tail Tempura, Fish & Chips, and a couple Fried Shrimp and tiny Crab Cakes. It was perfection!

The food is actually really good. However, the service and attitude of the staff is quite the contrary.Once a prominent restaurant in NYC, Lure has seemed to turn customers away by the culture that appears to be instilled from the management. With so many options in NYC that offer great food and service, there is simply no room in this city for a restaurant to maintain the culture that Lure has. It is not Carbone or Santina, and celebs are no longer dining there. Meaning, they need to realize in order to stay in business they need to change their attitude or they will be closing shop sooner than later.Rather than compliment their delightful food and ambiance, they seemed to have turned customers away by their pretentious attitude that is certainly not warranted.

1.0,6/12/2015,"AVOID so called 'Happy Hour'! Avoid all together! Sad to have to write this review --I have dined here before with a good experience. However, this evening my friend & I made impromptu plans to meet for a few well deserved end of the week drinks. I arrived first & ordered a drink. When my friend arrived it was very difficult for us to get any service from the waiter (she got stuck in traffic & arrived after 6pm--well into 'happy hour'). She finally ordered a drink. After this, our waiter disappeared for 20-30 mins & only reappeared to advise us that 'happy hour' would be over soon. By this point, my friend already had to go to the bar to order a drink as she was sitting there w-no drink or service for sometime. The waiter seemed quite disgusted by this & walked off. Yet again we were left w-no service, no check, nothing! Shocking! Finally the waiter reappeared to toss our check onto the table without so much as a word. At this point I was uncomfortable & wasn't sure if I should ask for a manager or just take the tab to the bar & pay it there. I was finishing a drink, my friend had no drink & we were never asked if we would like anything else, if we could be served dinner, if we minded tabbing out & moving to the bar, etc. Nothing. Before we could decide what to do, the waiter suddenly appears at our table telling my friend that the table is reserved, the reservation has arrived & would we mind him seating us at the bar---telling my friend that he has 2 great seats for us (this should have been done before the tab was rudely tossed on our table in silence). He rushed my friend over to the bar & as I caught up there was an uncomfortable exchange occurring at the bar. The two seats that the waiter had for us were already occupied by two  ladies. None of us knew what was going on at first, but after speaking to the ladies it was clear they already were occupying the seats so we apologized & ended up at the bar w-no seats. The two ladies at the bar were appalled at what just occurred as well. While all of this was occurring, I saw the bartender pick up our tab & put it under the counter. I asked my friend if she put her credit card or cash with the bar tab & she said that she had not. I had not either....strange. At this point I had made up my mind that I was going 2 management about this rotten state of service & unprofessional behavior. I spoke w- my friend & she agreed. We were perplexed as 2 why the bartender took it upon herself 2 take our check & put it away (that was never answered), but we proceeded down to the front of the restraunt  to request a word w-management. Here it goes from bad to worse --instead of really handling the matter w-any professionalism, the manager (Coran) spoke as though it was no real concern since we were 'happy hour' customers & proceeded to attempt 2 clear up the matter w-a free shot for each of us!!! Really?? I didn't need a shot (I can buy that anytime, anywhere)....what I /we needed was professional service! Not impressed!! He finally wasted more of our time going to 'find' the check (that the bartender misplaced...hhmmm???). He then gave us a card for a free drink upon a return visit.....all the while emphasizing that he would also be glad to set us up a Dinner reservations whenever we like ....even mentioning something as to 'happy hour' not really being such b/c all tables are 4 dinner reservations. As we were paying our check, my friend was feeling a bit bad about potentially not leaving a tip since she normally tips 20%+. I stated that I do as well, but giving any tip would be crazy seeing what we just went through & how poorly we were treated! The manager actually went on to say that we he would remind Brandon as to how to deal w-'happy hour' & that the tips are pooled so it wouldn't hurt him, it would hurt the whole staff. I stated that if that is so, then Brandon can explain the Zero tip he incurred!!  Omg--I'm surprised that anyone would care since apparently 'happy hour' customers don't matter---they should be getting all If their tips from dinner reservations!! Interestingly the table that we were sitting at was still empty when we left, as were a few more! To finish up this review, I chose to come to Lure because of prior good dining experience, not because of 'happy hour'! Reprehensible treatment of your customers! Perfect way to lose great business!

Additionally, we were asked to leave the ""reserved table,"" but no one was there to claim the table. To be flexible, we went to the bar and were told we had seats, but there WERE NO SEATS. Furthermore, we put our check on the bar table top, but the bartender, who is helping out Brandon, took it away in hopes we would walk out so they could arrest us. Fortunately, we walked over to management immediately and said our check was taken by the bartender and explained our issues with Brandon. Unfortunately, management only cared about us taking a free shot to clear it all up. We don't need shots, but just decent service. In return, we get a free drink the next time we come by. LOL. This is a joke. They are obviously struggling as a business. Come for dinner with reservations, but nothing else. They shouldn't even have a happy hour menu because management hates this population.

1.0,6/4/2015,"Utterly disappointed. Lure used to be a frequent lunch and after hours spot of mine when I worked in soho. My mom was in town so I took her to happy hours oysters. One of the raw clam we ordered smelled bad  so I let my waitstaff now. Instead of taking it away the manager comes by and asks me what the problem was. And I let him know the clam didn't smell right. He looked at me and asked if I was sure. (at this point im slightly taken aback) so I said smell it and I can't imagine you will disagree. He smells it and said, ""yes it does smell a little off."" and proceeds to look at me and then said, ""what do you want to do?"" (seriously?) so i let him know I was really looking forward to eating my clam and will he please get that replaced. So he picked it up and left. I'm in total disbelief at this point and my mother was wondering if this is how upscale new York restaurants do business. We also had the oyster shooters and that was tasteless. We had the lobster toast and while quite tasty was the size of a quarter. There were four pieces and it cost $12. Not worth it. We both had two cocktails as well which was pretty good. When it was time for the check we asked for it and 10 minutes later still no check. At this point my car service was waiting for me so I got up to ask where my check was. Turned out that the server i asked had completely ignored my request. I'm very unhappy at this point but no apologies and only a scowl from the cocky managers face. Lure, I've spent well over thousands of dollars at your restaurant and used to tell out of towners and visitors about you. This is going way back since 2009. You've lost me for life. I never expected to be repaid with your rudeness. My $80 check for the both of us during happy hour will be the last you see of my money.",0,0,0,roxanne o.,"Mount Kisco, NY",102,62,177

We both ordered the lobster bisque and I was debating on my entree so I asked the waitress about the Empress crab claws. She told me they were served raw but they were delicious. Raw? Crab? I questioned this but she insisted. She left to get our drinks and came back with a crab claw for me to try.  I thought this was super kind of her. It was delicious and served cold but definitely not raw. I ordered them for dinner and loved every bite. They were very similar to stone crab which I am familiar with being from Florida, and are served the same way. Oh well, she meant well.

However on this day my bartender ignored me for most of the evening and when I was noticed, was so rude to me that it made my guest really uncomfortable. I'm not sure why this was the case (since I was being my usual charming self) but I had to leave a message with my bill saying ""Sorry but you are the rudest bartender I have had in NY, and I have been to some shitty bars."" Honestly, it ruined what would've been an otherwise very enjoyable night.Do not ever bring a date here. I know I won't.(Rant is over---more reasonable review below)-Happy hour oysters are not $1 and you have only one choice of oyster: I recommend mermaid oyster bar, Ed's lobster bar, and upstate over Lure without hesitation-Happy hour drinks are still $8 for a glass of wine: slightly above average price with not much selection: you can go anywhere else unless you really have to be surrounded by members of the AARP while you get your drink on-Food: calamari is gross (I think it was covered in BBQ sauce)...I recommend Ed's lobster bar over Pure since the food there is amazing.Not impressed",2,1,1,Andy W.,"Manhattan, NY",308,126,100

My favorite sushi place in the world serves really crazy rolls, strange pieces and in combinations you'd never think of. And I couldn't be happier with it. But simple, delicious sushi definitely has a place. Lure mostly goes that way, but screws it up.A great piece of sushi has a lot of subtlety going on. The rice has to be good, the fish has to be good, and the hints of soy sauce and wasabi have to be good too. The less ingredients in a dish, the more important each individual ingredient is. And it seems like Lure doesn't totally get that. The elements of good sushi are there, but then each piece has tons of wasabi between the rice and the fish. And several had some kind of jalapeño chutney dabbed on the top.Tons of wasabi and jalepeño chutney grab subtlety by the collar and repeatedly punch it in the face. It's a sad thing. And maybe that's the environment here. I don't know, I've only been once.

3.0,5/12/2015,"A place where you can dine and feel like you're on a yacht, less the seasick motions of bouncing around on the ocean.  Their seafood is delicious, fresh and they have cooked and raw food options.  By decor alone, I could've given Lure a 4 star rating.  The ambiance was romantic because of the yellow lights reflecting off their wooden walls with the benched booth cushion seats.  Neatly designed, clean and high ceilings, for a basement restaurant, makes for a good environment to enjoy one's meal with a lovely companion.The food, however, is a hit or a miss depending on what one may order.  They have special sushi items every so often.  The sushi is fresh but it does get pricy when you order several pieces.  While it is good to try something new and not normally available, the pricing makes me reconsider the choices at time.  On this occasion, I came with my fiance to Restaurant Week.  My fiance and I ordered from their Restaurant Week menu and made additions of sushi from their normal menu.  I had tried their Miso Glazed Salmon and the mixed oysters from east to west coast.  The Miso Glazed Salmon was cooked well, moist and lightly seared without the skin.  The miso glaze was a dark savory soy like flavor, not too strong so the flavors of the salmon wasn't just overwhelmed.  Oysters were good, but nothing truly special to mention.  The mixed plate of sushi we ordered was good but for the price I wasn't blown away.  Lure is a good restaurant for special occasions.  The place looks great and the food is good, however the regular price you pay are just too steep to come here just because you're craving some seafood.  Lure receives 4 stars overall, less one star for the higher pricing model they use and it drops to a 3 star review.",0,0,0,Louis N.,"New York, NY",375,218,459

But it just doesn't do it for me. The place looks great - you're basically in the hull of a yacht (do yacht's have hulls?  I need to get on a yacht.) BUT, the bar area is not conducive to a bunch of people gathering around to drink and share oysters (i.e be a bar.) There are only ~ a dozen bar stools and a few small tables so it gets packed during happy hour and other prime times. Most of the times I've been here we actually haven't been able to order happy hour appetizers as planned because there's literally no way to eat them while holding drinks - and I am not the type of girl to not be a holding a drink.The other thing that rubs me the wrong way here is how the bartenders handle happy hour. They have a few yummy cocktails on offer during HH for $8 but I usually stick to wine - there's a red and white offering every day during happy hour. Every time I've asked what it was, I've gotten an eye roll!

4.0,3/3/2015,"Consider this a 3.5I'm rounding up because I'm feeling generous and, since my most recent visit was on restaurant week, it's usually been my experience that restaurant's are better on ""normal"" days.I'd recommend both the chowder and the tempura to start, but the salmon was just okay. The entrees, however, were more disappointing. Both the miso salmon and nori crusted tuna were fine, but each was good one level more than requested (all it takes is a short lapse of attention in the kitchen) and were pretty one-note in flavor. I mean they tasted fine, but really nothing special which was disappointing given a previous dining experience (over a year prior) and the many good reviews I'd read. I love eating fish out because I can rarely make it as good at home, but this felt a little flat. Good, but not enough to keep me coming back. On the dessert side, both the chocolate cake and butterscotch pot de creme were tasty and ended the meal on a high note. Overall, a good ""value"" during RW; affordable and above average quality. While the quality improves off the regular menu, the prices are pretty steep with avg. apps hovering around $20 and entrees in the mid-to-high $30's and it's not somewhere I'd necessarily rush back to.",0,0,0,Alex G.,"New York, NY",1,66,0

When it became apparent that there was no chance of leaving NYC that night, we decided to make the most of it and go see a movie.Yelping around the movie theater we accidentally found Lure. No way could we turn down the chance to try out somewhere with 900+ reviews and incredible seafood.So make the most of it we sure did. Oysters. Lobster. Cocktails. The whole, stunning, lovely restaurant almost completely to ourselves on a freezing Monday night. The nicest servers and hostesses who took all our coats and luggage and everything and were so sweet to our exhausted selves.Lure is absolutely gorgeous inside. It makes me want to go live on a yacht. There are few restaurants where the ambiance and food are symbiotic, but this is one of them (Ava Gene's in Portland, OR is another). I'd give 10 stars if I could. Worth every penny we spent (and we spent about $100 a head). 10/10 would definitely eat here every day if I was a zillionaire.Thank you Lure for the most amazing accidental NYC meal I have ever had.I'll be back for more as soon as I possibly can.",1,0,0,Margot D.,"Davis, CA",25,50,6

I enjoyed the bacon, but a vegetarian may not.  I had a bite of the shrimp tempura and loved how the black sesame added an extra dimension to it.   The lobster ravioli was very simple, so you better taste the lobster meat.  The butterscotch pot de creme for dessert was delicious, creamy like the pudding.  But really, how can you go wrong with pot de creme ever?  The other half of the experience of dining at Lure is the decor, which made me feel like I was on a cruise ship, with the retro slanted picture windows, or an older private yacht with all of the lighter color wood.  I felt like I was off the coast of Florida, which made me hunger for key lime pie, which is not on the menu.  Was a great place to try.

I'm personally not a raw seafood person so I don't know if the oysters was fresh or not, but I did try one and it wasn't for me. The shrimp tempura was really good, definitely recommend it even though it looks like a small portion.For entree we ordered the nori crusted tuna and lobster ravioli. You only get five pieces of ravioli, but it was really good and the sauce was different in a good way. The nori crusted tuna was cooked medium well (I think). The crust was intact and didn't fall apart when you bite into it, but the tuna was just too much for my taste. The rice was average, didn't taste bad. For dessert we ordered the warm chocolate cake and apple walnut crumble. The apple walnut crumble is literally like a apple pie, it's so good and warm!

5.0,2/25/2015,"Hands downy favorite restaurant in all of New York. Quite literally we make a point to eat here every time I'm in Manhattan. The atmosphere is awesome, like an old yacht which matches the food perfectly. Quick recommendations -Tuna Taco are out of control good. Chili Glazed Calamari is to die for. Miso Salmon is so good, you'll regret ordering salmon at other restaurants. Niro Wrapped Ahi is awesome, but you have to like to taste of seaweed as it has a dominant flavor. Surf and Turf is obviously amazing - lobster is perfectly cooked and steak is tender and high grade. Jalapeño Yellowtail roll is a must for sushi lovers. They used to have steamed lobster tails on spinach - but have recently removed it for whatever reason. The waitress told us it's on special occasionally so if you see it, splurge and get it. It's like heaven. In your mouth. Service is amazing and the staff is super helpful if you're indecisive. Go! You won't regret it.",1,1,1,Fidel N.,"Stanton, CA",246,48,103
4.0,2/24/2015,"Went here for my birthday dinner on a Monday night.  Even on a Monday night there was a wait so obviously the place is good.  Reservation was at 8pm. We were there at 7:30 so we hung out at the bar. I ordered this cocktail with blackberries and blue berries. It was really good! I was happy with my choice.We were seated pretty much on time as our reservation at a corner not too far from the bar. It got a bit chilly every time the door would open because of the draft (hence, the reason for 4 stars). Also, it's not a quiet restaurant. Expect noise and a lot of chatter. The ambiance is very nice though - you feel like you're in a ship. If my review was solely based on ambiance, service, and food, this place would get 5 stars. For appetizers, I had the lobster croutons and my bf had the raw bar sample from the restaurant week menu.  My lobster croutons were very good. I liked it a lot. I was able to try some stuff from the raw bar sample which was also good. My bf seemed to have liked it, too. As for our main entrees, I got the Ahi Crusted Tuna which came with Garlic Rice and spicy mayo. My bf got a sushi dish.  I loved my dish.  It was the right portion and everything about it was good. My bf especially liked the garlic rice. I was full but I wasn't on the verge of food coma.  I can't say much about the sushi but he seemed to have liked it. From what I did try, it was fresh and the miso salmon roll is good. And for dessert, we had the apple crumble from the restaurant week menu which was good as well.I really liked this restaurant and their food. I couldn't have asked for a better birthday dinner.  I would definitely go back to try their food some other time.  I understand why this place gets good reviews.",2,0,0,Laura B.,"Jersey City, NJ",71,35,24
4.0,2/23/2015,"Restaurant Week '15The 80's music was definitely the mood setter, especially when we were seated at a booth, and then we asked ourselves, ""Wait, are we setting sail?"" How cool is that their dining area is a set up like a cruise ship? Awesome. Even though my one year old daughter did not admire the decor, she did enjoy sharing the food with us. Our server kept her in mind and kindly gave her a special kiddie cup and her own side of fries as we slowly settled down. For starters, we had the Crispy Shrimp Tempura and the New England Clam Chowder. I loved the shrimp, deep fried perfectly and tossed in mild spicy mayo. I did not enjoy the chowder too much as the smokiness of the bacon overpowered the flavor of the clams in the chowder itself.I asked my salmon to be made well done and even though it was cooked all the way through, it still tasted amazing. The Miso Glazed Salmon was such a great choice, the piece of fish was big, and the sautéed greens were the best part--seasoned well and cooked just right. Karen ate almost all the greens, as parents we were so proud. My husband had the Nori Crusted Tuna, fish cooked to medium and the crust was beautifully wrapped all around, the crust stayed glued on to the fish. The smell of the fried rice was fragrant yet flavors weren't too overwhelming.All their dessert choices were very hard to choose from, in the end I finally decided on the Butterscotch Pot De Creme. Luscious, creamy goodness, Karen can't talk yet but she showed me how spoon fully licking good it was, homerun! My husband wrapped his meal up with their Warm Chocolate Cake. The cake was just so satisfying and the guiltiest part was the gooey chocolatey center as you cut through the cake and the sauce, from the top of the cake, running throughout. But, the popcorn and the caramel ice cream was the spotlight of the dish, and guess who ate it all? Hey, don't blame it on the kid, it was me!",6,4,5,Amy N.,"Brooklyn, NY",489,358,3862

You're dining underground and it feels like you're dining underwater! I love restaurants with high ceilings. Six of us sat in a u shaped booth, which was a little snug but not too tight.Food:Appetizer: Salmon Poke. Average. The taste of avocado (although one of my favorite flavors) overpowered the salmon poke. It was rather small and not too memorable.Main: Nori Crusted Tuna. OH MY. I've never tasted anything so perfectly crusted. The texture of the tuna (raw) and the crust was delightful and easy to eat. The garlic fried rice was really flavorful and the greens were cooked perfectly. Also, the sauce accompanying the dish was flavorful and not too spicy or strong. 10/10 would recommend. The miso salmon was also very flavorful.Dessert: Everything is good. Chocolate cake is actually molten. Salted caramel ice cream was on point, the butterscotch dessert was good (and not as sweet as the chocolate cake) and the toffee that came with it was so good and not too hard to eat. The warm apple walnut crisp was also rather large and tasted just how you would expect - yum.Everything with tip came up to about $32. Fantastic deal for the quality/amount of food.Service: Average.

I'll list the few not so niceties for you...Even with a rez on a busy Valentine's Saturday afternoon, it still took us quite some time to be seated. We tried to grab drinks at the extremely busy bar while waiting but the bartender told us he didn't know what Long Duc was or if we could buy a bottle of it...ohhhkaaay. Next, when we were finally seated, it was at the front booth in the main dining area - was quite windy bc of the proximity to the door but hey. We were also seated next to an incredibly loud and tipsy group of female patrons circa midwest Mama Mia fans, who were very rude to the busers and anyone who wanted to talk in a low, sexy, valentine whisper to their dinner partner, hello Me. Lastly, our waitress seemed a bit... new? slow to articulate? new? Not sure, nice girl but conversation was a tad difficult. All of that out of the way, THE FOOD IS STINKING AMAZING and the hostesses are sweet and pretty. We had the beignets, lobster bene, crab omelet and all types of sushi. Just decadent and over the top.

The star of my meal was dessert - Butterscotch pot de creme - mmmmmm. I also had a bite of the chocolate cake which was heavenly.

It was so thoughtful of them to split both entrees for is and gave us a side of fries each!!!! The burger was so flavorful and juicy, cooked to a perfect medium rare with the center being a perfect hint of pink. The lobster roll was very fresh and the amount of mayo used was perfect.

A good serving of queso and cuts of ham made for a flavorful and balanced dish. Not too spicy but there was a definite kick.  For dessert had the trio of ice cream and each tasted good:  chocolate was velvety, peanut brittle was smooth and chock full of peanut butter and the toasted marshmallow was sweet but not overpowering.  Solid coffee at the restaurant.

Although it was shuckers-choice, it was cool they didn't limit us to the basic Blue Points that NYC restaurants use for happy hour.The Shrimp tempura with spicy sesame mayo was also a standout app. The Crispy Calamari was not crispy at all, but soggy and had an unusual taste.The Blackberry Daiquiri was way too sweet for my taste, almost like drinking jam. The Spicy Paloma was much more to my liking with jalapeño agave tequila and red ruby grapefruit. I had two of them!Service was uneven and we had to reorder our drinks when they forgot.

Our waiter was very nice.The unfortunate part was that we were done wrong. My husband saw a kitchen worker come out of the stall and not wash his hands. I'm sure it happens all the time, but when you see it, it turns you off. He told our waiter, the waiter told a manager and then when we were leaving we were approached by a manager. A manager of social media who expressed his extreme disappointment for what we told him. So much that he took our name, number and email address and promised my husband a night to come back and to ""eat like a king"" and that we would expect an email the next day. We really didn't care to go back and do that as we don't go into the city often and we like trying new places each time we do.

So I sat at the bar in between two of NY's most random beings I've ever met! I mean this in the sweetest way! We shared our food and drinks (not in a gross way) and laughed so hard my belly hurt the next day! So back to my sushi roll, yea not that good! First plate had a piece of saran wrap in it! Yea, bartender (can't remember his name, he was not that great either) agreed it was not acceptable and made me another. Sad to say, the saran-wrapped-roll tasted better than the non. :/ Anyway, had to ask the bartender for water a couple times, he never refilled, he didn't know there were 2 options of cabarnet, oh wait he did but said no one ever orders the $25 glass! Oh ok..but shouldn't you know its still there? I order $25 glasses of wine! Think he's name was Jake, Peter or Sam... something very typical. I think he meant well, maybe he was annoyed at my new friend's obnoxiously drunk behavior but why so aloof with me? I'm sure I will drop by again, hopefully to meet and make more new friends!

Interesting menu items, everyone enjoyed what they had, I had the short rib and potato hash with poached eggs and loved it, although I would have liked my egg yolk to be a bit runnier. Really good though, great flavors and tender meat. We also split a few lobster rolls among the table, excellent! Ambience was fun, the restaurant is a few steps down from the sidewalk and the inside is intended to make you feel like you are in a large ship. The decor is nice and there are windows up top and you can see the people outside walking above you.

Lure's management should really be ashamed. Here's the story...Despite a 9 p.m. reservation no table was ready on arrival and a large group of 30 were in the midst of sports chant! Given the time, the option of leaving was out so I requested a quiet table.Our party of 5 was seated at a table set for 8 - in a room next to the obnoxious group (turned out they were all with Go Pro). After not having any service for an inordinate length of time we requested to be moved.While service returned to Lure standards after this complaint and the food was its usual ""good"" the Go Pro group got even more obnoxious as the night went on: shouting, group cheers, drunken boisterousness akin to a frat party (trust me -- I am not exaggerating) .Completely embarrassed by nights end I spoke with the manager as my guest were getting their things together. She apologized. When asked why she didn't do something about it she said, ""They are friends of the chef"".That's it!? A night ruined for a restaurant full of people for the chef's friends.

First we offered to move once the party that had he reservations arrived. The manager would have none of it. Then we offered to order dinner food but that still was absolutely unacceptable to her. She raised her voice and told us how angry she was and that we had 5 min to get out. Never in my life was I treated this rudely while trying to order dinner and spend my money at a restaurant. Again the place was half empty and they clearly didn't want our business.   A side note on drinks menu - they were below average on taste - with only 5 to choose from - priced around $9 (I wouldn't call that a happy hour special).,3,0,0,Olga L.,"Manhattan, NY",22,23,42

The space was nice for a large party and the service was attentive and cordial, but nothing above average. The decoration concept is cool (resembles a ship), but the music was so loud that it distracted from conversation. For the prices, the food portions were fair. I was more disappointed that nothing stood out as being exceptional. The food tasted fine (we shared, so I sampled several apps and entrees), but there was nothing that stood out to me as unique or far better than I could find elsewhere (I tasted both seafood and steak). The bathrooms (always important to me): Clean, but the toilet was very difficult to  flush - I had to wiggle the handle for a good while :/ They offered paper products to dry washed hands instead of an environmentally friendly hand dryer (I recommend they invest in a Dyson).

There was no wow factor. In fact, we tried the seafood salad the next day at Sarabeth's for brunch and preferred their version of the same dish. Lure House Roll - Prepared fresh but wouldn't stand a chance if measured against a quality Japanese restaurant.To be fair, the saving grace that night was the branzino entree.  I highly recommend if you do find yourself at this restaurant.  It was fresh, juicy and flavorful but not overly powered with seasoning so you can still taste the natural flavors of the fish.  However, with other seafood restaurants nearby, I would probably make a second tour back to those places before venturing back here especially at their current prices.",1,0,0,Sonia N.,"Boston, MA",610,398,2815

5.0,8/12/2014,"Lure has officially become my go to spot for lunch in SoHo and is quickly becoming one of my all-time favorite restaurants in NYC.

Last time I visited I had my favorite appetizer, the oysters. Lure's oysters are ALWAYS ultra fresh and tasty - easily some of the best in Manhattan. For my main course I had the Miso Glazed Salmon and it was brilliant. The salmon was cooked to perfection and served over a bed of sautéed sugar snap peas and shiitake mushrooms.

4.0,8/6/2014,"First restaurant week meal of Summer 2014 and left a happy camperLure Fishbar definitely had one of the better/appealing menus for restaurant week - the food here was definitely impressive.  I had the Oysters, Mediterranean Daurade and Butterscotch Toffee Dessert.  Oysters were very fresh; my friend who disliked raw oysters actually enjoyed it because there was barely any fishiness.  The Daurade was crispy on the outside and soft in the meaty area.  Butterscotch toffee was tasteful and not overly sweet - I really enjoyed the toffee candies.  My pal ordered the rock-shrimp and the Miso glazed salmon; I had a bite of each and I would have equally enjoyed her choices as well.  Bottom Line: Lure Fishbar does things right by serving fresh and delicious plates.",2,0,0,Susan N.,"New York, NY",13,90,104

The oyster appetizer was pretty good although the waiters didn't bother introducing the types of oysters they served. The cod entree (Asian themed) was solid, but tasted like home cooking. The creme dessert was solid as well although a creme brulee would have been much nicer.

SO GOOD. The fish was delicious. Skin perfectly crispy, not too salty and mixed well with the vegetables. The dessert was flawless, not too sweet but so creamy and a good portion. I had a taste of my friends Warm Chocolate Cake and wanted to gobble that up also. AMAZING.The only reason it's missing a star is because I noticed a couple repeats on the menu (the salmon tartare was offered the prior year also, but it was also pretty good) and we got seated in a very weird location right by the door and got everyone that walked in the door. Also the service wasn't amazing, just average.

5.0,7/30/2014,"Restaurant week lunch review:Walk into a boat! What? In Soho? Cool.Salmon tartare Fresh salmon on top of avocado. The salmon was pink, melt in your mouth texture that combined nicely with the more creamy avocado accompaniment. The four different types of sauces that came with it- made the dish. Try every one separately, then try them mixed together! DauradeNot going to lie, the skin was too salty for me, but the actual filet underneath was seasoned fine and cooked perfectly. Saltiness was slightly disappointing. However, the eggplant added a earthy flavor to the dish, which I really enjoyed. Overall, it was a nice light main dish which is what I was looking for. Chocolate cake Cake was dense and rich- could satisfy any chocolate lover, however the icecream with popcorn totally won the show. The combination.. Amazing. The crunch of the popcorn added to the salted caramel.. Drool. I had to stop eating the cake because I got a sugar rush but it was worth it.Great RW deal.",1,0,1,Gina K.,"New York, NY",550,171,977
4.0,7/30/2014,"First off, Lure Fishbar transported me from crowded Soho to a classic cruise ship on a hot summer afternoon. Next, it presented me with a solid set of options on the restaurant week menu and put my decision making abilities to test. I was already sold. The appetizers arrived swift. Gazpacho with crab salad for me - 4 stars. Risking the annoyance of my two dining companions, I couldn't resist but sample their oysters and shrimp tempura - 5 stars.  For the main course, I picked the miso glazed salmon. Crisp on the outside, tender inside and emanating subtle flavors, this fish was cooked to perfection. The Daurade and Cod entrees were attested to be lip-smacking as I noticed two plates emptying themselves in less than 5 minutes. My stomach was full but it magically made space to accommodate the warm chocolate cake for dessert. Whoever came up with the idea of caramelized popcorn and salted ice-cream as accompaniments to the cake, I salute you. Hands down, the best restaurant week lunch I have had.

Notwithstanding the fact that the restaurant had ample empty tables both when we arrived and when we left, the hostess seated us in a cramped space between other diners and next to a large party. Service alternated between a disappearing waiter, and busboys who instantly snatched empty plates and immediately brought the already prepared next course.  The wine pour was embarrassingly small.Restaurant week should be a reason to introduce potential new diners to the best a restaurant has to offer, not to treat them like second class customers to be fed and discarded as quickly as possible.3*.",0,0,0,Nora C.,"Manhattan, NY",0,31,0

They were served with with cocktail sauce and another sweeter sauce.For entrees we had the steamed Icelandic cod, which came with jasmine rice, baby bok choy and a ginger sake broth.

The lobster sliders were definitely a highlight - and they were able to customize the order size for our party. For our mains, we got the dorade and red snapper.

I also like that there are stairs leading down to Lure. I like this because it means that there won't be a bunch of tourists that just happen to wander in. I haven't got any qualms about the service. Oh, minus a bus boy touching my phone to wipe the table when I wasn't even done with my meal. That was pretty rude, but other than that nothing good and nothing bad. Of course with a nice place like this located in the heart of Soho you're not going to get amazing service. That's fine with me, though. I'm content as long as my glass is filled, and my order gets taken. I shared the grilled octopus appetizer. Get it. You're welcome. The octopus is tender, the creamed potatoes (I think it was creamed potatoes under the octopus) and whatever else was on there went together well. I ordered the lobster ravioli and my mom ordered the grilled branzino. The ravioli, while delicious, left me a little hungry. There were only eight or nine pieces, and I gave a few away. The tomato sauce it was served in was really tasty and obviously did not come from a can. The grilled branzino left my mother full, and you really do get your money's worth with this dish. It was flavorful and light. The desserts were my favorite part. I ordered the warm chocolate cake (served with salted caramel ice cream, caramel popcorn and chocolate pudding), and my mom got the carrot cake cheesecake (served with rum raisin ice cream and candied walnuts). The rum raisin ice cream was fantastic. Ugh. I can't even. It's good and heavy and delicioius and you will need to drink water halfway through, but sometimes you just need to treat yourself. It's good. That's all you need to know.Overall, I can't wait to come back here. The food and ambiance are both great. This is a great place for a nice date.

2.0,4/17/2014,"Maybe I came here on an off-night, I don't know.I came off an 11 hour work day and had walked into Lure Fishbar with a couple girlfriends. It was a busy Friday night, which in some cases can excuse lackluster service but in most cases, no. Friday nights are jam packed everywhere, no excuse for the wait staff to loom over our table every 15 minutes... to clear the table, NOT to refill water/ask if we wanted more drinks. I had told them I was NOT finished eating and he literally cleared the table as my fork was ON the plate... I've never experienced anyone that rude.I ordered a salad that was overly bitter and had a hint of car freshener taste. I don't remember what it was called but just ask for the bitter salad, with bits of brown rice and a minty car freshener smell to it. The ""lemon zest"" furthermore added to the car freshener taste I'm referring to.Nothing special about the appetizers. The shrimp tempura tasted like it had been deep fried in extremely old oil and the spicy sauce on it tasted like mayo + siracha sauce mixed together. The tuna tacos had a cream-like avocado sauce on top of it and it didn't go too well with the tuna, I don't know. Not for me.2 stars for the cool ambiance, it really felt like you were on a yacht.

4.0,4/11/2014,"Lure Fishbar is a MUST for all of you seafood lovers out there.When you walk into Lure Fishbar, you are immediately taken into a yacht -- but not in a cheesy, themed restaurant type way. It is done just right.Let's talk about the food. The oysters were amazing. Served at the perfect temperature, and fresh every time. I love a good west coast oyster, so the Kushi ones were my favorite (we ordered a dozen on their own. We also ordered a few of the Garnished shellfish plateaus -- and you should as well. You won't regret it. The sauce (radish, jalepeno, ponzu) they put on the Kushi oysters is amazing.  The tuna tataki was phenomenal and the avocado complemented the flavor of the tuna. The sushi bar combination plate was delicious and included the standard assortment of fish that you would receive in any sushi platter (the sushi grade fish is served on top of white rice, so it looks more like sashimi). Again, the fish was incredibly fresh. Lastly, the grilled mahi mahi tacos were unreal. The sauce they put on it was very tasty. You have a choice of hard or soft taco shell -- go with the hard.Also, for all you boozers out there -- you can't skip on the cocktails here! The Dulce Caliente was my favorite - sweet but with a little subtle spicy kick during the after taste. The service was good -- nothing memorable but the waitstaff are friendly and attentive.

Super fresh, and delicious-Lobster Tempura Roll & Yellowtail Jalapeno Roll: Were delicious but no point to order when there is so much amazing seafood hereEntrees:-Nori Custed Tuna: Favorite, Mind blowing, got it rare, and it was the freshest and best tuna I have had. Nori crust was the perfect touch, with a little side of mustard -Lobster Ravioli- Delicious but I could leave or take it, on point with other restaurants-Sauteed Branzino- Second favorite - very flavorful, perfectly cooked, what all branzino should taste like -Steamed Red Snapper - Perfectly cooked snapper, as good as it gets.Overall this was some of the best seafood I have had in a long time.We spent 300 a couple here after tax and tip, for the quality of food and experience it is worth every penny.",3,0,1,Leo K.,"Brooklyn, NY",240,443,483
3.0,4/2/2014,"3.5!!!!!!!!! But I can't......... oh well too bad.My wife and I dined at Lure Fishbar to celebrate her birthday on a busy Saturday night. The interior decoration and ambiance of the restaurant was fantastic. Once pass the reception counter, the alluring surrounding adequately projected an interior of a yacht, instant party mode! Too bad the restaurant lacked a dance floor, otherwise it would be perfect. We came with a reservation at 6:30PM and was quickly received and led to our table. Overall, the service for the night was great, our waiter was very responsive and the dishes all came in a timely manner.Now on to the food! For the night, we started off with 8 oysters, one of each on the oyster menu plus two special oysters of the day, 5 sashimi pieces of big eye tuna, yellow tail, blue fin, sea eel, and sea urchin from Maine, crab cakes, salmon tartare, deviled eggs, buffalo chicken lollipops, and nori crusted tuna for entrees. I would rate the dishes as follow:1. Oysters - fresh, fat, sweet and salty. My wife and I loved every piece.2. Sashimi - disappointment! Wife and I are sushi and sashimi lovers and we would scrutinize and criticize greatly and mercilessly. The whole experience from service to dish was bad, not terrible since the meats were fresh. First when you would serve sushi/sashimi, don't pour soy sauce for your customer. And if you did, then you shouldn't dump a whole saucer-load when only a pinch of wasabi was provided. Second, a good cut of meat would mean it would melt in your mouth, hardly any chewing needed. Yet we were given pieces with so many tendons that we had to chew very hard to swallow. Third, when you serve sashimi style, you would usually give two pieces per type of fish not just one especially when your prices were the same compare to everywhere else. Finally the sea urchin from Maine tasted salty and disgusting; I would guess local American breed couldn't match with air shipments direct from Japan.3. Appetizers -rating varies. Great crab cakes, sweet and lumpy crab meats paired with smoked pineapple and jalapeno and the only drawback was the presentation.  The salmon tartare was equally great. Deviled eggs were average. And the chicken lollipops were one of the worst, as it was super salty and sour, even Costco frozen ones would beat this.4. Entrees - OMG delicious! The nori crust was fried crunchy and the tuna cooked perfect. And surprisingly it was served with a layer of the best fried rice I had ever tasted in a none Chinese restaurant. The rice was cooked with a slight crunch and perfectly seasoned. Lure was a great place to dine at for romantic dates or celebrations. Food wise, you should skip the sushi and sashimi part; it would be a waste of money on these inferior selections.",1,0,0,T.K M.,"Jackson Heights, NY",3,66,81

My 4 friends and I went for dinner and everyone came out extremely satisfied with our meal.  This is also now one of the restaurants I would go to again (I rarely go to the same place twice) for the next Restaurant week. It is suggested that you make reservations at least a week in advance, especially during Restaurant week.  Reservations get taken pretty quickly. We all arrived a bit late for our reservation, but the hostess at the restaurant was extremely nice and pleasant about it.   There were also plenty of tables, so I guess we came at a time in which they weren't that busy. I had the salmon tartar for my appetizer, which was decent.  Then I had the branzino for my entree.  The branzino came in a pretty big piece, about  the length of my palm, and grilled to perfection.  It laid on top of broccoli rabe, seasoned with raspberry vingarette.  The broccoli rabe surprised me the most.  I'm usually not a big fan of broccoli rabe and its bitter aftertaste, but the chef did an amazing job with this plate so that my broccoli rabe was not only tasty, but did not come with any displeasing aftertaste. For my dessert, I had the berry crumb pie with ice cream, which was good.  My friends had the chocolate cake with caramel icing and ice cream, and that was sooooo good.  I had a bite of their dessert and I suddenly was a bit disappointed with mine.I'm definitely coming back next year.  For $35, it was a steal with the amount of seafood we ate during the night.",0,0,0,Kei Ling W.,"New York, NY",49,291,89

Being the first Friday in lent, we opted to go to Lure Fishbar based on the rave reviews they received on yelp.We went for lunch for the $25 prix fixe menu. The hubby and I decided to split one since we were going to be eating a lot that day =)We got the salmon tartare to start, the sushi and maki as an entree, and the chocolate cake with caramel ice cream and caramel popcorn for dessert. The tartare was alright. Nothing speciate. The sushi was terrible. The fish did not seem fresh. The cuts of fish were very small. The rice was meh. The highlight of the meal was the dessert! The chocolate cake was dense and rich, which was complemented nicely by the caramel ice cream and crunch from the caramel popcorn!Our friends ordered the oysters, which they enjoyed. I think the winner of the day was Adrain J. who ordered the branzino, which was cooked perfectly with a delicious, crunchy skin. The service was a little snooty. We obviously weren't the normal clientele at this restaurant. The place looks pretty cool. As everyone has mentioned, it looks like you're in a yacht, which is pretty neat. Also, during our meal, they were filming some sort of reality tv show. Entertaining to watch the chef come over and over again to serve the same plate of food to the same table =) Overall, our experience here was very lackluster.

However the wait for our food was soooo unbearable. 5 out of 6 of us got the oyster platter for our appetizer. This took about 15/20mins. I would be more understanding if the place was full, but there were several tables that were empty. I would also understand if they had to actually cook our appetizers but everything was raw!! After they wet our appetite with the oysters, we waited about 45min to an hour for our entrees. Holy crap we were hungry. There was no bread with EVOO so we just sat there chatting and drinking and waiting for our food. I was about to get HANGRY. When the food did come, it was like I said, delicious. Although the time we had to wait for it deterred me from the whole experience. I can't even tell you much about the food because even as I write this, all I can think about was how hungry I was waiting an hour and half for my entree to arrive!!!I really hope it was because of RW that caused the untimely service, so I would actually come back again.

Lure did not disappoint; we left determined to come back again soon! The ambiance and the food were exceptional! RW may have lured us in (harhar), but our experience is what will be bringing us back.Although we did order off the RW menu, we ended up ordering a medium raw platter which in itself cost almost as much as our combined RW dinners. And it was totally worth it! The oysters, the shrimp, the clams, the lobster claws, and the seafood salad were simply perfect. In terms of the RW menu, our fish entrees (He had the salmon. I had the branzino.) were both cooked and seasoned perfectly. This was the best RW meal I have had, hands down.Since we ordered the additional raw platter and had a generous amount of cocktails and wine, our RW dinner ended up not being a bargain at all, but when a restaurant is able to deliver like Lure did, we were happy to pay every penny and plan for our next resurn.

If there is one thing you have to try is the smoked salmon pizza. Beautifully sliced North Atlantic salmon, cream cheese, red onion and capers on a toasty round flat bread.

I had a few other stops to make, so the location was convenient and allowed me to get into the City then back on the turnpike with little to no drama!Pros: Neighborhood, sushi selection, restaurant did not wreak of yucky fish, the hostess was simply delightful, the restaurant reminds me of a posh submarine, the shrimp tempura is the BEST EVER IN LIFE, everyone is very well dressed and quite chatty..... Not typical for the average New Yorker.Cons: To afford the drinks you absolutely must cash in on one of your 401 Ks! I had one (Very small) prickly pear margarita and it was $16! The calamari was bland and they didn't provide you with sauce of any sort. Who does that? All in all, I'd likely return and/or recommend Lure to friends.... However, only during Restaurant Week! The prices are steep and I'm not convinced that you need to spend that much money on ""Just Okay"" menu items.",0,1,0,Ivy J.,"Trenton, NJ",80,20,16
3.0,2/18/2014,"Actually, it's more like a 3.5 - but only because I felt the service could be just a tad better.  The ambiance is so creative since it's situated below street level and has round cruise ship windows looking out at Prince Street.  We also loved the decor on the inside which made us feel like we were sitting inside a ship.  Thankfully the waiters and hostess weren't dressed up in nautical attire - keepin it classy Lure!! We made reservations and were running a few minutes late and when we called to inform the hostess, they were perfectly okay with that.  Once we got there, we were immediately seated.  It took at least 7 minutes before anyone came to take our order but at least we were fully ready and knew what we wanted! We had the Crispy Rock Shrimp which was sooo good that I spent half my time there trying to decipher all the ingredients in the yummy sauce that was drizzled on it! We also had the Calamari, which was done perfectly! Not overfried which kept the consistency nice and not chewy. Extremely fresh and well seasoned. Our third appetizer was the Tuna Tartare, which needed something to actually eat it with.  Usually tartare is served with tortilla strips or on a rice cracker or some sort to add crunch to the texture, but this lacked that crunch factor which made this our least fave appetizer. Onto lunch - we had the Branzino and the Salmon which were so delicious that we each finished our plates clean (very rare for us)! The salmon was cooked medium rare and kept the flavor of the fish and the crunch on the outside gave it a nice texture.  The fingerling potatoes were nice and soft and flavored well to complement the fish.  The branzino came with a potato mash which was a perfect accompaniment with the meaty fish - a nice 'meat and potatoes' feel, as my hubby described it.  The capers and broccoli rabe that came with the dish were also well seasoned and delicious! Our desserts consisted of the chocolate cake and the butterscotch creme de pot and while neither of us could finish the dishes, trust me - we wanted to! Great experience - will definitely be back here!",1,0,0,Sabeena M.,"New York, NY",22,70,14

5.0,2/17/2014,"Upon entering Lure Fishbar, you feel like you've just entered a luxurious submarine boat. You got greeted warmly, and everybody was smiling to you.I don't know how we got so lucky to get seated on one of the round sofa seats, spacious and comfortable, also giving me and my company enough privacy. It's good for people-watching too. haha~Now on to the main point, so we came for the RW menu. My friend and I ordered different 3 courses to share, so that both of us ended up trying 6 dishes. I have to say, among those 6, nothing disappointed, and a few items really shine out!!The oysters, as you expect, were fresh, and of significant size. I love the shrimp cocktail sauce, but I enjoyed the other vinegary mixed with horseradish sauce even more!Entree was tough choice, my friend ordered the cod fish; I opted for the salmon. Have to say, the cod was pretty on the look, but the sauce was a bit too tomato-y for me, and I definitely preferred the texture of the medium-cooked salmon by a large scale. If I were to choose again, I might have suggested my friend to pick Bazino, which is a European sea bass, the fish meat itself of which would probably be more sophisticated and savory.But yeah the salmon was awesome!  Get it medium. Dessert!! The warm or even hot apple crumbler, topped with cold vanilla icecream. Gosh, it's the *exact* dessert one would crave on a cold winter day!!The other dessert I picked was the toffee cream. It was quite light, not as sweet as apple crumbler. I also really liked that thin piece of caramel chocolate cookie on top - it's not a mere garnish -  it made the perfect pair with the toffee cream cup. All in all,  my friend and I both loved this place. Not just because this was one of the most enjoyable and relaxing dining experience, or because it is chic and trendy, Lure Fishbar's people are nice and warm.

4.0,12/26/2013,"Lure is a seafood, raw bar, and sushi bar... and is exquisite. Kyle took me here for my birthday and it's one of my new favorite spots (definitely a NY exception). Lure is great spot for a special occasion or somewhere sure to impress. The restaurant is under the Prada store in Soho and is looks and feels like you were transported out of Soho and into a yacht at sea. Everything we got here was fresh and so good! I have been dreaming about their Tempura Shrimp and just about everything else we ordered since August 4th... I need to go back.The oysters were decadent, and our waiter gave us some glorious recommendations. We ordered the Fried Calamari and he suggested that we do a half and half option of the Calamari and Tempura Shrimp. Best idea ever. The Fried Calamari comes with a smoked chili glaze and the Tempura Shrimp come with a spicy sesame mayo. I'm all about sauces and these two are great. The Calamari was good, but the Shrimp was stellar. Despite being fried and tempura battered, the taste of the shrimp was still flavorful, plump and fresh. The batter was light and crispy and the spicy sesame mayo just complimented it perfectly.The Lobster Croutons were also a good choice with golden garlic and chili's on sourdough, topped with fresh lobster and basil. Our waiter also recommended the Lobster Tempura Roll with lobster tail, tobiko, spicy and avocado which was good... but standard, nothing special. Next time I would opt to try a sampling of their sashimi instead or their tuna tartare which I hear is awesome.The best thing we had: The Pan Seared Salmon with fingerling potatoes, mushrooms, and leeks in a dijon sauce. I will preface this by telling you that I am not the biggest fan of salmon, but this dish was one of the best I've had in the city. The salmon was cooked to luxurious perfection and was delicately pan seared and the flavors from the dijon sauce were bold yet not over-powering, and the potatoes, mushrooms and leeks enhanced it all. So. good. For dessert, we tried the ice cream sandwiches which completed a perfect meal. The cocktails are great, and they have a happy hour that is not to be missed: Cocktails are $8 (normally $14) and they offer $1 oysters, the fried calamari, shrimp tempura and more all for under $9. Great deal for a great taste of Lure without splurging.

The bar is always crowded, but the bartenders manage really well and I never have to wait long before someone takes my drink order. They also always give you water without even asking if you sit at the bar, which I always appreciate. The music is on point and kinda on the loud-ish side, but that only adds to the trendy vibe. Patrons are generally good- looking and stylishly dressed.Service was attentive (our waitress even gave us an order of their homemade potato chips on the house after we found out that they're no longer complementary). We had the deviled eggs and lobster croutons as starters. Both were on the smaller side, but they were really well done so I enjoyed every bite (especially the lobster croutons!).I had the grilled whole daurade as my main and was surprised at how good it was.

2.0,9/27/2013,"I came here because it was on NY's Eater Top 38. Eater recommends the burger, which we got, both the one on the menu and the secret one off the menu. The burger off the menu was okay, I think I still would have preferred Red Robin. The one on the menu - the waitress tried to compare it with In-n-out....in n out would have been better...I mean wayyyyy better. Since this place is called Lure Fishbar, I also tried out some of their seafood dishes, the lobster roll was okay. I would have it again, but only if I had to. I've definitely had better lobster rolls from many other places, including at the hole in wall fish markets off the pier. My friend had some white fish with manila clams. It was a bit over-salted: which never speaks well for the chef, but overall edible and cooked well. Overall, the food was edible, but definitely not worthy of the 38 IMO. The drinks were decent. The service was bland....speaking of service, why would you take reservations at 10:30PM if you know the kitchen is going to close soon and the specials are going to be sold out? Illogical, I think so; at least give us a warning to take an earlier reservation. Also, I kept having this strong feeling that PDiddy was going to come out and spray everyone down with Moet, since the inside decor was resembling a yacht and the music was all club rap and hiphop.

Looks like you're on a boat!My husband and I are both vegetarian, but we still decided to join the birthday festivities. I eat some seafood (no fish though) on special occasions, but my husband doesn't eat any. He ended up just snacking on onion rings as they don't have any vegetarian entrees. The lobster croutons were pretty good, but too small. Pop 'em in your mouth and just as you're starting to enjoy it, it's all gone. The grilled baby octopus was tender and was served with saffron potatoes. It was okay. Seemed like it was missing something. I had a big lunch earlier that day, so I had the crab cakes appetizer as my entree. (This is now $19, not the $16 listed on their website.) Lots of crab, not too much cake. Served on top of a refreshing pineapple salsa.  Rich and filling, despite how small they looked. Service was excellent, even though the restaurant was packed that evening. It was, unfortunately, extremely loud. A packed restaurant, top 40 hits playing, reflective surfaces, ugh. The food is nicely presented, and I did enjoy the crab cakes... however, the pricing is a bit steep.

I have NO CLUE what some of the other reviews are talking about when it comes to lies, service, high traffic tables, etc. I was a few minutes late, but we were seated right away when I arrived. We were treated very well from beginning to end.Their crispy calamari with the smoked chili glaze was scrumptious and I order calamari basically everywhere I go that has it. For an entree, I ordered off the menu and demolished their Bash Burger, which is the BEST. BURGER EVER. And I'm a burger connoisseur, so I would never say that lightly. Again, it's OFF THE MENU. My dinner companion was rather strict in how he ordered, and our waitress was very patient and the kitchen nailed his order in one try (the chef came by our table, he was wonderful). For dessert I had the Double Chocolate Peanut Butter Pie, which is as much of a mouthful as its name suggests. Delicious, though. My companion had the Blueberry Almond Crumble and ate as much as he could after all the other food that had graced our table. I don't know why some people feel the need to down a place because it's full of beautiful people or run by wealthy individuals. I don't go to restaurants for that reason. It's a restaurant, it's supposed to be about the food, drink and service. This is one of the places that gets it right without making anyone feel out of place (there were children here the night I dined). I observed many different people and everyone was having a grand time, from the group of 4 businessmen at the table next to us, to the large group of friends in the middle of the main room to the people at the bar. By the way it's not overwhelming, but the restaurant does look like the inside of a yacht. Not in your face, but its smile inducing.

It was flakey and the red curry coconut broth made it a hearty dish. The curry wasn't too heavy so it had a nice balance to add some flavor to the fish and the rice.

Lure is in the heart of SoHo and as you descend down the steps and into the restaurant your expectations get pretty blown away. From the outside it looks like Lure may be some shady NY place that you have to walk down the steps to, but as you enter, you'll see that the inside of the restaurant is modeled after the inside of a yacht or cruise ship deck. Cool date spot but may be a bit loud.I would like to point out that the waiting staff here is especially attentive. My glass of water never fell below 1/3 full! Superbly impressed. I drink a lot of water when I eat and I love it when the staff is attentive about that kind of stuff. Mad props! They were very nice and accommodating as wellMoving onto the food. My friend and I came here to try the summer restaurant week 2013 menu and were pretty impressed. We basically wanted the same 2 things off the menu so between the two of us we split the raw bar tasting and rock shrimp tempura for apps, chatham cod and the nori crusted tuna for the main course and the blueberry crumble and warm chocolate cake for dessert. Oh and since I read that the burger was pretty good and since we were HUNGRAY, we decided to split the Lure burger for sh*ts and giggles.Apps: The oysters from the raw bar were especially good. You get 2 from the east coast and 2 from the west along with 2 pieces of shrimp cocktail. I regret not asking where the oysters were from but the smaller ones in my picture was really tasty. Though the larger one (kushi from the looks of it?) was good too.Rock shrimp tempura was better than I expected as well. I love the sesame oil taste that you get when you bite into it. Not overly sauced with mayo either which was nice.Burger: Yeah this deserves its own section. They split this in half prior to serving us since we had asked to share it. The burger was AWESOME. very simply made, no bacon or other exotic toppings, just your simple lettuce/cheese/tomato combo. Got it medium rare and the juicyness/tenderness of the meat was amazing. also there is something to be said about that bun....perfectly toasted with a light swipe of butter I think on top? SO GOOD.Main: Both of the main courses were good. The chatham cod was cooked superbly well and had really awesome texture as the middle was cooked soft, the fish flaked off nicely and the outer edges of the piece of fish was seared to crispy perfection! Though I'm not a huge fan of tuna, it was good as well! Get it medium rare to keep the tenderness of the meat. The rice that it comes with was a little hard though much to my surpriseDessert: Blueberry crumble was awesome! The blueberry crumble by itself is a bit too sweet but pair it with the scoop of ice cream on top and damn that is a good dessert. Warm chocolate cake was pretty good as well. Kind of wish it had a molten center though instead of just liquid fudge on top. The caramel popcorn that was paired with the ice cream that came with it made for a nice touch though!Will come back!

The hostess seated us a table right in front of a pathway with high traffic. After observing surrounding empty tables, we figured there were 3 to 4 open ones (seated 4 too). We requested for moving us to one of the more comfortable 4-seated tables but got rejected by hostess with a ridiculous excuse, "" We are fully booked!"". We made reservation too and we were already in the restaurant. We were just asking for one of the open 4-seated tables not in front of the pathway! Fine, we were moved to a small dark area with leaking pipes in the ceiling; you can tell from several up-side-down open hanging umbrellas up there. At least we would not be hit by pathway traffic. During dessert course, we figured there were no complimentary bread served and the rest tables were all served with edamame. So we asked our waitress, Christiann (as shown on receipt), if edamame on the next table was complimentary. She answered without hesitation, ""they ordered it"". What a coincidence all the other tables in the restaurant at that time all ordered it but us. And it is NOT on the menu. At the end, it was confirmed by our friends dining at the same time on the other table that edamame IS complimentary. Christiann is really good at lying!The food is below average. Raw bar sampler was ok; entree during restaurant week, cod, has no flavor at all and taste like rubber band. 2 of us got upset stomach when we got home.

They put us at the table in front of the passage way where the staff passed by a lot. We asked if we could switch to another table, and they said they can't because all the tables are reserved, and then put us in the back room. Question: we made reservation about a month ago, and we came earlier than the others. Why can't we move to other empty tables that also can seat 4 people? Were all other tables specially requested when being reserved?2. Our waitress Christiann LIED. My friends were extremely hungry and wanted some bread before appetizer. We noticed that all other tables were served with a bowl of edamame. So we asked our waitress if we could have edamame as well, and she told us that other people ordered it. Although it doesn't make much sense since this is not a Japanese restaurant and people don't come here for edamame, but we took the answer suspiciously. After dinner, we stopped by our friends' table and asked them if they ordered the edamame. They told us it was complimentary and served right after they got seated. WTH?? Its not like we are super stingy, especially that we ordered drinks, which are the most profitable items in the restaurant, we just could't believe that why our waitress lied to us over such things.

1.0,8/8/2013,"Been to Lure many times and always loved it. However, went there for dinner a few days ago and it will be my last time. WHAT HORRIBLE SERVICE!!!! We were rushed through the entire meal. My friends and I didn't even finish our appetizers and they were ready to take our plates away to set down the entrees. Then as I was finishing my entree, the bus boy came to collect my plate while my friends were still eating. What poor etiquette and service. They were sure in a rush to collect our dishes but never once came to ask if we would like another drink or some more water. Overbooking reservations only to rush your patrons is disgusting and a huge waste of my money. This will be the last time I ever come here.",0,0,0,Ann T.,"New York, NY",140,98,5

4.0,8/7/2013,"I went for Restaurant Week 13' with two friends and we enjoyed our dinner tremendously. The waiter was very nice and provided service well. The food was great. I got a tuna tartar for my appetizer that was nothing special but my entree on the other hand. I got a tuna crusted steak cooked medium over rice pilaf sautéed with either kale or spinach. It was AMAZING. It was perfectly crusted and cooked. The tuna was sooooo fresh, felt like it just came out of the water. Just mouth watering and delicious. My friend got the cod and it too was cooked amazing. It was fresh and airy, fluffy and not oily. Served over a bed of grapes and ratatouille. She loved it and I loved the bite I had of it. For dessert, my friend got the chocolate cake which tasted okay. It was not special or anything too tasty to be quite frank. My friend and I took blueberry cobblers served with a scoop of vanilla ice cream atop. That was the perfect ending. Not too sweet, just tart enough to put a perfect final you h on you palette. It was great. Overall, I had an AMAZING experience and I would most certainly go here for any seafood because its obvious they know what they're doing and that they're using great quality products.

4.0,8/4/2013,"Restaurant Week can get old in NYC.   The best of the best don't really offer ""their best"" so I tried something different with bf last Friday.   Lure Fishbar, a trendy Soho spot that's under ground and shaped like a boat (fishbar, get it..? Watch those floors, they are woody-slippery!).     The RW menu looked good.  As expected, a day before I could only get a reservation at 10:30.  We arrived a bit after 10 and they did seat us, but for future reference, I would have tried walking in and just snagging sushi bar seating (which was quiet, towards the back). The space, along with the boat theme, is beautiful.  Beautiful decor, beautiful people.  But I don't really care about all that.. the food is actually really, really good.  While the busboy did a great job refilling waters, others aspects of service are left to be desired-- from recommendations, to precision of remember who ordered what to changing waiters. Whatever, no big deal. Everyone was nice enough.  The portions do seem smaller but meals in their entirety are filling (thanks to the deserts).I went with this 3 courseRaw Bar Tasting- No one told me what oysters I got but I used my palate and affinity for oysters to guess kumamoto (YUMMM) and bluepoints.  So fresh and clean.  The shrimp cocktail (which is always whatever) was really plump, clean and went great with the usual suspects- cocktail sauce, horseradish and vinegar.  Very good option. The Sushi- one roll of choice (spicy big eye tuna), and 6 sushis...the usual suspects (salmon, yellowtail, etc). Among that stood out was the tasty, sweet eel piece  The roll was really good- plump, yummy tempura flakes.. but despite the waiter suggesting the sushi, I didn't think it was any better than your above average sushi spot.  Don't get my wrong, the sushi is very clean. But I sort of wish I got the tuna...Creamsicle Custard- DO NOT GET THIS unless you LOVE creamsicle. This is just entirely on me, I don't dig creamsicle at all as the sweetness is too much for me but I wanted a panna cotta-y experience.  Custard was very spot on though- rich, creamy and filling. Bf had:Shrimp tempura- almost like a beer battered, very well seasoned (interestingly so), not overly fried, big, fresh pieces of fried shrimp. No run of the mill panko here.  The potion was a bit big and I thought it was better sans the spicy mayo (which was a little drowning). The cod- fresh, deliciously spot on seared cod, gooey on the inside, crispy on the outside.  Wrapped enough awesome ratatouille and flavorful pesto.   Probably one of the best fish dishes on the menuThe almond blueberry crumble- surprisingly huge.  Gooey, hot/cold yummy granola, nuts and other yummys mixed in with melt-y blueberries. All with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. I would come back- the scene (due to the 'hood) lends itself to be more group-friendly, sort of a nice ""girls night out"" place.   GREAT to get in on RW if you still can...(and if you love seafood)",5,3,1,Stephanie Y.,"New York, NY",878,1242,25

4.0,8/3/2013,"Went here this Friday night for Summer Restaurant Week and a celebratory dinner. The boyfriend and I both really loved it.  I would break down my rating as follows- Food: A/A+, Ambiance: A+, Service: B+FOODAbsolutely delicious overall.  For appetizers we shared the shrimp tempura (yum!) and the gazpacho (really really amazing).  We also added an order of the lobster croutons since they were not on the restaurant week menu and I was so excited to try them.  Actually turned out to be my least favorite thing. Still really good, but I just felt the other two appetizers were clearly a step above.  For the record, my boyfriend disagreed and loved them.  For entree, we both had the nori crusted tuna. Wow. Just wow. Perfect medium rare, with the soft middle contrasting with the nori crunch. Fried rice/some sort of greens/unique spicy mayo were amazing accompaniments.Desserts also delicious- the warm chocolate cake and especiallyyyy the blueberry crumble (and I'm normally a chocolate person).Also, DON'T miss the Strawberry Basil Martini. I saw so many pictures here on yelp and was confused when it wasn't on the menu, but they were happy to make it for me.  So so so amazing, one of the best cocktails I've ever had. Although I think they were slightly weak.  But that's ok for me!AMBIANCELoved the luxury yacht theme. The idea has the potential to be totally corny but they do it really well.  It mostly comes through in the architecture and they don't overdo it.  I saw tons of reviews mentioning the noise, but in my opinion they are a little dramatic, at least according to our experience last night. Yes it was one of the noisier restaurants I've been to but I like a lively atmosphere and it didn't affect our conversation.  They played fun music like hiphop, reminding me a little of Beauty and Essex except dialed down a bit.  Definitely a younger crowd.SERVICEThis is the only area with some negatives. Nothing glaring, but still. Hostesses seemed flustered and were pretty slow to seat, so everyone was clustered in the doorway waiting to give their name- I know it's busy but other places seem to manage. I just hate this because it makes me anxious lol.  Our waiter was perfectly fine and nice.  At one point I had a bite or two left on my plate and I could feel and see the bus boy watching me and waiting to clear it. We had a 10:30 reservation and they were clearly not needing our table again, so I don't see the reason for the rush (we also were not the last table in the place). Not cool. But that was the only thing that actually bothered me...the other stuff didn't really take away from the experience much.So despite the few blips in service, we will definitely be coming back.

4.0,7/29/2013,"I was one of the many restaurant week people in attendance tonight and I had quite a pleasant experience. I don't typically go out to seafood places, because it is not usually my top choice for food. However, immediately upon walking into this venue I was impressed by the decor and the boat-style windows. It did feel like you stepped foot into a subterranean area!We had a party of six and I found the waiter quite attentive to our needs (all of us are yelpers to, little did he know). We split choices from the restaurant week menu and I settled on the Yellow Tomato Gazpacho Soup as an appetizer. It was quite tasy, served cool as it should be. A great summer choice.My entree was one of my few complaints about this evening. I tried the Roasted Kuna Bay Salmon and it was in my opinion a little under cooked and slightly lacking in flavor. However, I sampled the tuna from my brother and the special (grilled snapper, which they let us substitute) and they were much tastier. This may just have been an unimaginative choice on my part. They provided a very sparing side of potatoes and you could see that it was more about the presentation then anything for the entree.I absolutely loved the warm chocolate cake. It hit the spot, with a side of salted caramel ice cream.  That alone, gave Lure Fishbar an extra star! Slight complaint, due to acoustics in the venue, it made it a little difficult for me to talk to the two sitting on the left side of the table (we were a party of six).Overall, I would consider coming back, if I wanted a trendy Soho seafood dinner.",2,0,0,Jon B.,"Greenwich Village, Manhattan, NY",165,417,3

Thats really the main appetizer that needs to be ordered.  They were phenomenal and the raw bar platter was fresh and well rounded with alot of seafood all prepared perfectly.  The grilled spanish octopus had a rich buttery texture, would definitely reccommend. The tuna appetizer was light and refreshing, well done but not the shining piece.  And lastly was the lobster toasties, I can't say I was all that impressed, but didn;t take away from my dining experience.Onto the Main:  The Daurude was my main, picked for me by our waiter.  It was delicious.  A rich white fish with a lot of flavor.  Two of my friends ordered the Tuna which was done superbly, this outshone the appetizer tremendously and I would definitely recommend.  The last in our party was the curry red snapper which was very flavorful and enjoyable as well, but not my favorite.  Definitely order the lobster sliders, they are expensive and tiny, but they are little morsels of deliciousness.  Can't think of any word better to describe.   Would definitely reccommend this place.",1,0,0,Dominic M.,"Jersey City, NJ",490,44,1
4.0,7/9/2013,"A very solid option if you're in SoHo and in the mood for sushi (I've only ever had sushi at the sushi bar here, so can't speak to anything else).  The Sushi Only Combination Board is always very good, and more often than not the sushi chef tops you off with a complimentary delicious little something either pre- or post-meal.  The pieces are a little on the small side, but each is always fresh and delicious.  Service is very efficient, if not overly warm.  I usually walk in without a reservation and have a drink at the bar while I wait for a spot at the sushi bar.  The beer menu consists mostly of generic offerings, but at least there's Brooklyn Lager so not totally hopeless.  Bartenders are generally friendly, but at peak times they're woefully understaffed so getting a drink will take some time.  What it would take to up my rating:  more thoughtful beer list, more bartenders, and slightly greater bang for the buck for their sushi offerings.",2,1,1,Todd P.,"Brooklyn, NY",2,18,0
3.0,7/8/2013,"Had high hopes for this place but just because the food looks good doesn't mean it IS good. If I could break it down, I would probably make an amateur summary about this place that it was opened by a bunch of rich folk, connected to a network of ""talented"" chefs. The interior is amazing, like the inside of a ship. I love the ambience and it's definitely a place to take your date to. Unfortunately, the taste of the food does not match the beautiful aesthetics of the interior.The server was nonchalant at best. He checked on us after we got food......never. Could care less about our service/experience. His busboys did most of the work and they were awesome. Everything else, he seemed to just shrug off. As customers, I was offended. We spent hundreds of dollars here not to be served by some self righteous dude. Onto the food. I definitely recommend starting with oysters but it is pricey here. I recommend beau soleil and the shigoku (when they have it). Really fresh. If you are craving oysters, come between 5-7pm for $1 happy hour oysters. What we got:Hamachi Carpaccio - Fresh, smaller cuts than expected, beautiful sauce to accompany it, vibrant and clean.Amberjack Sashimi - Pretty small cuts, but the fish itself is beautiful on its own so this, I could only give credit to whoever picked the fish for the day.Grilled Octopus - I'm a sucker for octopus so I was excited to try this one out. Tender, grilled to perfection. I loved the mashed potatoes it came with but not so much the bell pepper relish that was on top of it. It killed the taste of the octopus for me. Tuna Tiradito - It's probably everything you'd expect it to be. Nothing special or memorable about it. Again, very small cuts.Daurade - They take out the entire bone in the fish. Perfectly cooked and simple.Black Cod special - I asked which dish the server recommended between this and the Roasted Cod. He answered with such assuredness that I was sure this couldn't fail. This dish disappointed me thoroughly. Made me think whoever created it, has no sense of taste or combinations of spices. The one good thing about this fish is the cook + freshness. The rest of it was so muddled. It was topped with a ginger, mushroom, leek ""salad"" with a green sauce I could not figure out. I ate this yesterday so if I cannot remember the taste of certain things, that is a bad sign. The ginger was overpowering. Clearly whoever thought slicing ginger that thick on a dish is inexperienced. The cod was served ontop a bed of spinach that was barely seasoned. There were fresh hot red pepper slices sprinkled throughout but the heat from that and the overwhelming ginger was just disgusting. It almost tasted like it was salty but it wasn't. My tastebuds were so confused. Just pure disappointment because  the chef kind of ruined that cut of fish right there.Skuna Bay Salmon - By far the best entree we had. The salmon was cooked to a medium rare perfection. The sauce and richness of the salmon was buttery, melted in your mouth. It was just amazing. Portion size, too small.Branzino - Perfectly cooked fish but confusing ratatouille flavors didn't go well with the dish at all. I would probably go back for the oysters and some small dishes but I wouldn't eat an entire meal here again. They have amazingly fresh seafood that they have no idea what to do with. That is my 2 cents.",2,0,2,Ha-ti N.,"New York, NY",193,112,4

4.0,7/1/2013,"Want to feel like you're eating fresh seafood in the cabin of a luxury yacht despite being nestled away in the heart of SoHo? If so, head to Lure Fishbar where they make that experience a reality seven days a week.AtmosphereThe interior of Lure Fishbar is modeled to evoke the look and feel of a cabin from a luxury yacht. Wood paneling, portholes and a slew of marine accents combine to form one incredible theme. Looking around, if I didn't know I was in New York City, I would have sworn I was floating out on the high seas.FoodThe menu at Lure Fishbar is expansive. It spans everything from your more traditional seafood fare, including a sizeable raw oyster bar, to sushi. There were a bunch of us at the table, so we ordered from across the menu. A sample of what we had:Crispy calamari: smoked chili glazeGrilled baby octopus: saffron-potato, fennel, pickled carrots, guajilloTuna tacosSeared branzino: pancetta, broccoli rabe, Manilla clams, garlic brothNori crusted tuna: garlic fried rice, Chinese broccoli, citrus emulsionDouble chocolate peanut butter pie: peanut brittle ice cream & chocolate covered pretzelWarm chocolate cake: salted caramel ice cream, caramel popcorn & chocolate puddingEverything - from the appetizers to the entrees to the desserts - was presented perfectly. The kitchen at Lure didn't shy away from using colors to brighten the various dishes and nearly everything had some highlight of color in it.At first glance, I thought the calamari was going to be very heavy and weighed down by the chili glaze. However, looks are deceiving and I was pleasantly surprised at how light it was. The fish tacos were equally as good. The shell was similar to a fried wonton and it was exploding with fresh tuna. This was topped with a wasabi puree, but don't worry, it didn't add much spice to the dish.The seared branzino was double the seafood for one price. A filet of branzino was laid on top of broccoli rabe and placed in a broth filled with clams. The branzino had a mild flavor, as expected. Surprisingly, my favorite part of this dish wasn't the fish itself, but the clams and garlic broth instead. I loved dipping bread to soak up the garlicky broth.While the branzino was good, the hit of the night was the nori crusted tuna. If I could do it all again, I would order this as my entree in a heartbeat. Tuna, cooked nice and rare, was wrapped in nori which appeared to have been lightly fried. The taste was incredible - contrasting between the cold interior tuna and the warmer nori on the outside. A great mix of flavors and presentation.Dessert didn't disappoint either. I mean, how can peanut butter, chocolate and a pretzel fall flat? The peanut butter pie was covered in a very thick layer of chocolate and the pretzel provided the salty addition to make this my ideal dessert.ServiceThe service was as you'd expect at any seafood restaurant or steakhouse - attentive and prompt. Our waitress took time to walk us through the menu and answer our questions while making sure we were well taken care of the entire night.ValueYou're eating at a seafood restaurant in the city, what do you expect? The prices are on the high side - $14 for calamari, $31 for seared branzino, $32 for nori crusted tuna. I'm one of those people that doesn't understand how seafood restaurants or steakhouses get away with charging these types of prices. However, they're in line with your typical seafood restaurants and the food was delicious. Lure is definitely a restaurant for special occasions.The VerdictLure Fishbar was a fun place to eat. Across the board, our food was delicious. The added bonus was the interior. The team at Lure did an incredible job making it truly feel like you're eating while drifting miles off the coast in a luxury yacht. The prices are on the high side, but the service and food is there to back it up.

5.0,5/23/2013,"This is a much belated review written in support of Lure following the rumors of it eventually closing following a possible rent hike this fall. Sentimentality is not having any effect on the score however, Lure stands on its own merits.---How Lure, my neighborhood seafood restaurant, became a hit among a younger energetic crowd is something of an enigma. It is THE place for people in New Media and tech start-ups. This is no Meatpacking District lounge with a restaurant alibi (looking at you STK). Neither is it some gimmicky sushi joint  with inflated prices because they a have a guy with a Japanese sounding name behind the counter.It actually appears as if though Lure has found the sweet spot of location, menu balance, great decor and clientele while remaining a great restaurant and bar. Shocking, I know! Having been here numerous times I don't know what to pick out. With three different bars depending on what tickles your fancy for the evening you are hard pressed to not find something fresh and delicious at your visit.

5.0,5/20/2013,"Initially,  I was under the assumption that this place was a sushi bar, but noticed there was much more offered on the menu.  Having recently acquired a taste for oysters, I decided to start with an order of two (the Kumamoto, partly b/c of the recommendation from the waiter).  The verdict? Delish!  Very smooth and not overly metallic or briny.  Next came the arctic char sashimi, which I've never had before.  It was very clean tasting, another plus.  For my main, I ordered the cod with endive and lentils.  Another hit.  To cap off the meal, I opted for the maple tart  since I wasn't counting calories that day and it was an excuse to stay longer in this cute space!",1,0,0,Matt A.,"Brooklyn, NY",93,218,16

I was so impressed with our server - she was friendly, professional, totally on top of everything and just all-around awesome. Huge points for her!As for my drinks, my martini was totally crave-worthy. I started with a glass of prosecco, which was nothing more than your standard sparkling. But then I moved on to the strawberry basil martini, and it was insane. Sweet, but not too sweet, flavorful, and refreshing. I would have ordered three, if I didn't think they'd catch up with me later. But seriously, I don't think you could just order one... I'd love to recreate this cocktail at home.The atmosphere is meant to feel like you're on a boat, which is cool since it's situated in the middle of NYC, but I think on a sunny afternoon I would've preferred a brighter spot.

Luckily my date liked me a lot so he allowed me to consume most of this awesome dish :DSquid Ink salad: Hm.. not good. not bad. Date ordered it just to add greens to our mealCrab Cakes: LOVE. I am biased since I love crab cakes. However, I have tried many a places which do it bad. So this is awesome. You can taste the layers of fresh crab meat. It falls apart so you know it is molded together from scratch!Lobster Ravioli: NOT SURE WHY everyone recommended this dish. I only ordered it because it seemed like 8/10 people wrote about it. Kind of disappointed that I got this. The tomatoes were cooked too long so the tarty flavor lingered in your mouth. I think my tongue got cut. Only could tell it was lobster because I ordered it. Not a bad dish but not worth the raves.Decor is so nice! I love how it is hidden out of the way.

3.0,4/25/2013,"Decor/Ambiance: 5/5- very well done, looks like the interior of a yacht- good open space layout, big big dining area- good amount of bar space if you're waiting for a seat - people eat at the bar too though so it might be hard to sneak in to order a drink. - good for dates, but a little on the noisy sideService: 3.5/5- servers were very attentive, water was filled often and waitress returned to ask if we wanted another drink when our beers were empty- I could tell the servers were well trained for good attentive customer service, however you can clearly tell that moral is not very high, when not talking to customers, they have a rushed, angry, frustrated look - this applied to about 90% of the staff- we had reservations for 930 but came around 830, they said we could hang out at the bar and they would come find us if anything opened up sooner. 15 mins later we were seated. =)- one gripe, our server never asked us how our food was, and only returned when she saw our beers were empty, give us our dessert menu, and check. Food: 3.5/5Lobster croutons - six- 1 square inch pieces of garlic seasoned croutons with a layer of lobster on top - delicious, I could eat these all day!Yellowtail Carpaccio- 8 thin slices of yellowtail topped with clementine slices and mint - nothing specialHoney Roasted Cod ($28)- no complaints, could have been a little less cooked, the texture was not as buttery as I expected cod to be. Roasted Hamachi ($31) (daily special) w/ apple wood bacon, peas, - completely overcooked, dry, chewy. I was very disappointed. - good flavor, I enjoyed the black eyed peas with baconGiven previous reviews, it could have just been our bad luck that service was rushed and food was overcooked.

Although surf 'n turf doesn't evoke the best of connotations, Lure executed on both fronts pretty well.Oysters from the raw menu were all really good (especially the kushi's). The appetizers were especially great; try the shrimp tempura and the baked clams. They claim to have an award-winning burger here, and indeed it was above average. What was even nicer was that the waiters knew we wanted to split the dishes and brought everything out already split for us.The only downside is that the place is a bit pricey.

1.0,2/13/2013,"I took my husband to Lure Fishbar for his birthday and both of us were pretty excited to go.  My husband loves seafood and sushi.  They seemed to have OK reviews, so the idea of being able to have seafood & sushi seemed pretty awesome.  We were there around the time of ""Happy Hour"", and ordered a bunch of food.  The food was ""ok"", but it definitely was NOT amazing.  Then I saw a HUGE cockroach crawling on the wall that our table is leaning against.  My husband saw the waitress and waved her over to let her know.  The waitress - flustered didn't know what to do, so my husband asked if he wants us to dispose of it.  She goes, yes - one of us has to - but if you don't mind.  My husband killed it in one of the napkins; but I was pretty disgusted.  In all honestly, we all know that rodents exist at restaurants.  My husband owns a restaurant in the city; we're NOT naive or stupid about this fact.  One thing we like is that these rodents and insects are no where NEAR us while we're eating.  The manager came over afterwards and recommended an appetizer she loved and comped that one appetizer.  The thing is, I've been to plenty of other restaurants in the city who has comped appetizers for us for having done a LOT less in terms of bad experience for us.  My husband - being in the restaurant business was annoyed.  After all, we hardly cared for the appetizer we were comped.  He was like - the least she can do is give us 20% off the bill; and being the confrontational person that he is - he was chatting with the waitress after we ordered yet another round of drinks.  He said to the waitress, is that all your manager is going to do when a cockroach was this close to crawling on our food that I killed?  Instead of graciously saying well, that's the usual policy, etc.. etc.. - she says ""well, yea - you got a free appetizer for that already - and let's be honest, that wasn't really a cockroach, that was a beetle"" REALLLY!?!!  Yelpers - since when does THAT make it a difference.  Whether or not it was a cockroach or a beetle, should the rodent been anywhere NEAR our food?  Why was she arguing with us over this?  AT the end of the day, the service SUCKED.  The food was average, and for the price you pay, you can definitely get something extraordinary somewhere else in the city.  We will definitely NOT be recommending this place to any of our friends and will definitely be discouraging all friends/acquaintances from ever stepping foot into Lure.",0,0,0,Cheryl N.,"Queens, NY",20,45,62

Another pro, they have a great wine list.  Con, the tables are so packed together I had a hard time getting into my chair b/c the man behind me was about 6' tall so he needed a bit extra room.  desert was delicious, and they didn't seem upset that we sat and enjoyed our 2nd bottle of wine.

2.0,2/8/2013,"I only booked 1 reservation for Restaurant Week and it was to Lure Fishbar. I was so looking forward to it, but left disappointed.Everything I had was good (not spectacular), but my complaint is for what was lacking.First off, I booked the reservation because of the falsely advertised menu. Boo! No New England Clam Chowder. Then, they didn't have the whiskey for the Moonshine Whiskey drink (my Bellini was delish though). When my bf was served the alternate soup he wasn't given a spoon because they were ""out of spoons,"" so we sat there staring at our appetizers for a few minutes before they could wash one. I don't understand why the food was served to us. The Tuna Tartare app was tasty when eaten with the bruschetta, but not without. The appetizer and entree dishes were super quick, but almost felt rushed. I may have gotten that impression due to the waiter literally running into our table a couple times. My Branzino entree with pumpkin risotto was the highlight of the meal.All of a sudden, when it was time for dessert, the service slowed way down. I received my cappuccino and was worrying it would get cold before I got my Warm Chocolate Cake. Then I found out why it was taking so long...they were out of cake. I ordered the Mocha Pot de Creme instead. It was good, but 2 out of the 3 things that I wanted on the menu weren't available so it was ultimately disappointing. Then our waiter even went missing. We sat there for a while until some random lady brought our check. I have no idea who received the tip I left.The experience was utter chaos.

The shrimp was a good texture, and I loved the sauce it came with. My friends got the raw bar tasting, which they said was awesome. Entree - Branzino with pumpkin risotto. I was freaked out at first by the pumpkin, but it was so delicious. The Branzino was also definitely the highlight of the meal. Everyone I was with loved it. Also, the waitress told us about some prawn green curry that sounded pretty good as well, but I would say the branzino is a solid choice. Dessert - My friends said meh on this one. They weren't wowed by the crumble or the chocolate cake. However, I got the special (carrot cake with rum raisins and cream cheese ice cream) mentioned by the waitress. Best dessert.

Surrounding it will be a scene right out of Felicity (this will probably reveal my age). If you have some time, it's a great place to be lost (for I was lost). I browsed along the Prince Street, stepping on marble stones and finding street art randomly on the pavement. Walk towards Lafayette, the opposite direction to Lure Fishbar--you may find more hip bars & restaurants to add to your list of places to dine and wine. Along the Prince Street, I've never felt richer to be part of New York City: the world really was my oyster for that moment. Yes, the restaurant. You'll find the restaurant in the corner of Mercer and Prince Street. Down the stairs, you'll find flickering light seeping through the windows. The restaurant exuded this err of black & white chic. There was no appropriate waiting area--the bar was my best bet. Good luck finding a seat at the bar for I had to stand around the bar, in everyone's way, waiting for my friend to arrive. This restaurant had one of the finest and extensive wine collection. Love, love, love! We ordered oysters and shrimps--one of the best oysters I had in the city (I've had oysters from The Mermaid Inn and John Dory Oyster Bar). The wine and oysters were the highlight of the night.

5.0,1/28/2013,"I went here during Restaurant Week with a couple of friends.  I had a wonderful experience - the decor was very cool and the food was fantastic.  I ordered solely from the prix fix menu and got the following items:1. For starters, I got the Fresh Shucked Oysters.  It came with half a dozen East Coast Oysters, with cocktail and mignonette sauce on the side.  They were not the best oysters I've ever tasted, but they were still really good.  The oysters were very fresh and went very well with the sides they provided.  Overall rating: 4/5 stars.2. For the main entree, I got the Honey Glazed Cod.  It came with a medium sized piece of fish with lentils and small mushrooms on the bottom.  This was my favorite.  The fish was very flaky and soft and tasted wonderful with the lentils and mushrooms.  I find myself wanting to go back to Lure just so I could have some more cod.  Overall rating: 5/5 stars.3. For the dessert, I got the Apple Walnut Crumble.  It came with vanilla ice cream and tasted just as I expected it to.  It wasn't anything particularly dazzling, but it was still pretty good.  Overall rating: 4 stars.In terms of decor, I loved the ship decorations. It was very fancy and I loved how everything looked together.  Overall rating: 5/5 stars.So overall, I give the food a 4.5/5 stars and the decor a 5/5 stars.  I would recommend this place.",5,0,2,Catherine Z.,"Manhattan, NY",28,13,0

5.0,1/25/2013,"I've eating like a queen all week thanks to my main squeeze, Paul H. I swear, he's fattening me up so he can make sure my Texan body can withstand NYC's winters. This was the closing meal for my Restaurant Week vacay and it did not disappoint! Lure Fishbar made me feel like I was Ginger and Paul was the Professor on a tricked out version of the S.S. Minnow. Throughout dinner I had to fight the urge to sing ""I'm on a boat."". This restaurant knows know to keep a nautical ambiance without looking tacky. :)We were slurping oysters left and right like there was no tomorrow. They were sooo good. East coast oysters all day everyday.  Lobster croutons are kind of a ripoff but man they are freaking tasty. The fried calamari wasn't too bad. I can definitely live without the fried oysters. All I tasted was mayo.I'm kind of a nerd so when I saw Branzino on the RW menu I was super excited. I had to pay tribute to Spideman! I wanted to eat what Peter Parker ate. Luckily, my nerdy-ness *sp paid off because that Branzino with its crispy skin was scrumptious! I didn't want to share my filet-o-fish but sharing is caring so I traded Paul a piece for his salmon. The salmon was cooked to perfection but it was lacking something. I swear I've made salmon a little more tasty. (I think it's my Vietnamese secret weapon -fish sauce :x)  The sides that came with our fish was good. I ate all of the butternut risotto which was a huge mistake because it made me a little too full and I couldn't finish my apple crumble dessert. Lucky for Paul, he got to scarf the rest down for me.

The only downside was that our server this time around was so blah. I don't even have a good word to describe her.

I would suggest to get a latte with no sugar while having the chocolate cake to balance the flavor. Service: I was not pleased by their service. The waitress who took our order was nice.

4.0,1/23/2013,"Lure Fishbar is about as hip as Soho gets. As many other have noted, you descend the stairs on the corner of Mercer Street and walk into a very yacht-like environment. It's definitely pretty cool inside and since we came around 12:30, the lunch crowd had the place hopping and it only got busier.My girlfriend and I came here today for Restaurant Week. I had noted in my reservation that she is pregnant and asked she be provided with a cozy, comfy and roomy seat. After checking in with the hostess, we were promptly seated and they were very accommodating, giving us a corner seat, on a bench, where she had plenty of room.Moving onto the menu, there is one gripe about their RW Lunch menu - NYC Go, which links to Lure's RW menu, and the menu posted on Lure's website, are slightly different. One difference is minor - Honey Glazed Cod vs. Steamed Market Cod, but the other is a bit more offending - New England Clam Chowder vs. Kabocha Squash Soup. I had seen the RW menu off NYC Go and was a bit surprised when it wasn't on Lure's RW menu. Our server was very nice about it tho and said others had asked the same question and the staff had fought with the chef about substituting, but he wasn't permitting it. She did say it was ok to substitute the soup of the day - Chicken Matzo Ball soup. I ended up going with the Freshly Shucked Oysters, as did my girlfriend. The chowder did look really good tho, with whole littleneck clams and bacon. I'll have to come back for it.For our entree, I selected the Sushi Combo - 6 pieces of sushi and one maki roll - you're given a choice of three rolls, I chose Yellowtail Scallion. My girlfriend had the Honey Glazed Cod. For dessert, we chose the Warm Chocolate Cake and Apple Walnut Crumble.We also chose to order one off menu item - as in it's not on the Restaurant Week menu or the regular menu. It's called the Bash Burger. It's meat of made of a secret Pat LaFrieda blend and it's topped with caramelized onion and bacon jam, shaved pickles, secret sauce and American cheese.Ok, our appetizers came first. Each serving of oysters came with a half dozen Blue Point oysters. Normally, I can't stand how the Happy Hour oysters (or Restaurant Week ones) are always Blue Points, but being that they are slightly out of season, the oysters were improved in taste - sweeter and less briny. If you're wondering, my girlfriend gave me all of her oysters except one. You didn't really think a pregnant woman was going to eat all that raw fish, did you? The quality of the oysters was very high tho, as I'd except from Lure.Moving onto our entrees - no complaints about the Sushi Combo. The six pieces of sushi ranged from eel, tuna and salmon, plus other pieces of fish that I don't remember. As with the oysters, the raw fish was very fresh and delicious. The Yellowtail Scallion role that I chose was right up there as well.I was less enthused about my girlfriend's cod. It was served with Oyster Mushrooms, Ponzu, Cilantro and Scallions. The cod by itself was a bit bland, but if you ate it with other items in the dish, it improved.Moving onto the burger - it was really, really good. I know it seems odd to find an amazing burger at the Lure Fishbar, but believe it. Perfectly cooked to medium rare, the burger itself is very juicy and the toppings are superb. They also put on enough toppings so that you get some in each bite. Another plus is that you don't run out of burger or toppings before the other. If there's one gripe about the burger, it's the price tag - $18. Just an FYi that you can also find this burger over at Burger & Barrel.Moving onto dessert, the Apple Walnut crumble was yummy, but familiar. It was served warm, with vanilla ice cream and is your typical disk of apples and walnuts baked with a crumb topping, with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. My girlfriend's Warm Chocolate Cake was served with Salted Caramel Ice Cream and Candied Popcorn. Yummy, but rich. I was focused on my dessert and only had one bite of hers, which she was unable to finish.No complaints about the service tho - our server was friendly and professional. She even knew what kind of oysters were served as part of the RW appetizer. Water was refilled often and between her and the bus boys, dishes were promptly cleared as well.The final bill? $25 x 2 for RW lunch, $18 for the Bash Burger + tax and tip came to around $85.About the neighborhood, parking is very difficult to come by, so it's best to take public transportation or park in a garage. Definitely worth checking out tho.",1,0,0,John-Paul P.,"Madison, NJ",68,149,839

Although the fish was very flaky, overall the flavor was kinda bland. My other friends ordered the branzino fish dish- which was pan fried and oh so crispy,  was clearly the better choice.3) for dessert - I got the lavender yogurt panna cotta- so smooth and creamy, with a hint of lavender and lemon.

The pork chop was very thick and well prepared but slightly too sweet. I would probably try something else next time. The desert of chocolate cake came with salted caramel ice cream and popcorn.

We have a friend who claims this is the best burger in NYC. Seafood dishes are ok. Growing up in California, where we dont have to pay an arm and a leg to get decent oysters and sushi, Lure seems a bit pricey but not that bad compared to other NY restaurants.We did come here once to drink. A bartender named Annie was the BEST EVER and served us up pretty good and drunk. She makes really good cocktails and we would come back to visit her again.",0,0,0,Tiffany M.,"Pasadena, CA",123,52,4

I had the Lobster Roll, it was really good and tasted fresh.  For dessert I had the Sorbet, they give you 3 scoops of different flavors and I chose Peach, Raspberry, and Strawberry. Service got kind of slow the later it got so I would suggest making reservations with time so that you can get something earlier in the evening. I would definitely go back though.",2,0,0,Yesenia P.,"Orlando, FL",190,195,25

4.0,1/2/2013,"I've heard a lot of great things about Lure Fishbar and I finally got the opportunity to try it with my girl friends for a night of celebration. If you're a fan of seafood, then yes, you have come to the right place. For appetizers, we ordered calamari and ahi tuna poke.  I've been kind of obsessed with poke ever since coming back from Hawaii and try to order it whenever I find the opportunity to do so. It is like raw salad served on tortilla chips. I like it because it's really refreshing as an appetizer and it doesn't make you too full. Here, it is no exception and enjoyed every bite of it. For entrée, I ordered the Lobster roll  which was overstuffed with lobster meat. Definitely more than I can handle but overall it was delicious. Lobster meat was fresh and chewy, however, I wish they toasted the bun a little more. Like what many Yelpers have said, the dining experience makes you feel like you're on a boat. It is dim yet romantic with circular windows which gives off a maritime ambiance. Perhaps a few more drinks will definitely add a more cruise-like experience. *wink wink* Service was friendly and attentive.

3.0,12/17/2012,"We had a very nice meal at Lure Fishbar, despite the lackluster service.  A few of the dishes were tasty enough but looked rather silly on the plate, given how diminutive the portions were (lobster crouton comes to mind). Pricey too for the sizes - $18 for 5 miniature bites of food is a little rich. They also used a rather unappealing cut for the octopus app (intead of baby octopus, they used a cross-section of a very large tentacle, which left a great deal of odd, black connective tissue that was quite unappetizing), which spoiled it a bit, despite being an overall well-composed dish. They were accommodating to my son, the main dishes were lovely and we had a nice evening. Was it special or spectacular? No.  Was the food incredibly inventive and inspiring? Again, no.

4.0,12/3/2012,"Lure Fishbar, located right in the heart of SoHo, is actually decorated like the inside of a yacht. Since the restaurant is actually in the ""basement,"" it makes for good use of the small windows up top, making you feel like you're out to sea.I went here actually a while back for restaurant week, and was very pleased. We made a late night reservation, after putting away some drinks at Puck Fair, my favorite bar in Manhattan, so around 10:30 or so.The food was great, although definitely a little pricey. The wine was delicious but expensive, I noticed some bottles on the list that could be purchased for a fraction of the price at any liquor store in the area. The staff was nice and attentive as well.We started with a tuna tartare, which was great. Although it's hard to mess up a dish that needs no cooking, it was really fresh and seasoned really well. They have a lot of sushi as well, which looked great but I'd had some for lunch so ultimately passed.Next up we ordered the raw bar taster; oysters, shrimp cocktail. It was good but not exciting. As we'd been getting our fair share of oysters at Miller's in Williamsburg lately, I suppose we'd been spoiled.For entree we had the branzino and the salmon. My branzino was actually quite good, although lacked any real amazing-factor or unique creativity. The salmon was similar in terms of culinary creativity. Considering the rapid-fire rate that my boyfriend consumed the desserts, with a fork in each hand, I can assume those were good.Ultimately, this is a good place for lunch, for sushi, to take an out of towner, and an okay place for a date; but what you pay for is the unique (and superb) atmosphere, but little else. Don't get me wrong, the food isn't bad, but like I've said; in New York City, why choose ""good"" when ""great"" is just around the corner? That being said, I'll certainly be back because I've since read their reviews from a more recent time, and they seem to really have stepped it up.",1,0,0,Corinne C.,"Manhattan, NY",65,165,31

4.0,11/18/2012,"After finding this place on Yelp, I was slightly skeptical. I've had mixed experiences finding places that were well-reviewed and having slightly less than satisfying experiences.The waitress was sweet, but the person that impressed me most was the busboy. Although he was serving a large area, he was constantly checking on us, clearly unnecessary plates and filling out water. We only had 3-4 dishes between the two of us (my mother and I), but we must have had the busboy at the table 5 or 6 times.The yellowtail carpaccio was delicious. Incredible delicate, and the fish fell apart in our mouths. The baked clams were also amazing. They had the perfect combination of flavor and texture. We also ordered a special, which was an appetizer portion of pasta with garlic, shrimp and leeks.

4.0,9/17/2012,"Lure Fishbar has been open since 2005 but a recent weekday after work visit proved that it's still one of the hottest spots in SoHo. In fact, Lure is favored among celebrities and other NYC chefs that snapshots of famous sightings at the restaurant gets posted and tweeted about quite frequently. And why wouldn't it be a hot spot? The food is delicious and the sexy yacht interior makes anyone enjoy their time at Lure.Dinner at Lure is a satisfying affair with crudo for appetizers, grilled whole fish for the entrée and fun desserts to top it all off. The sushi bar is also quite excellent. There is, however, a price that comes with the sexy interior as you'll notice the noise level becomes almost intolerable as the night progresses. And so I recommend you come to Lure for an early dinner or a lovely weekend lunch. A happy hour menu is available during the week and you'll find a beautiful crowd gathering here for cocktails and oysters after work. Aside from expertly shucked oysters there are clams, lobster croutons, and everyone's favorite chicken lollipops. Wash them down with wine or the ginger apple martini and your night is off to a good start. The staff is friendly but during happy hour your server might seem a little harried.

During the meal the assistant chef came out of the kitchen with raw cookie dough and different colored sugars for my kid to decorate. Then they baked it in the oven for him and brought it back out hot and fresh-baked. The dessert was to die for as well. They had so many tantalizing choices I could not resist. But it finally came down to the assorted little ""ice cream sandwiches"" and the peanut butter chocolate pie - with a chocolate covered pretzel and peanut brittle ice cream.

1.0,9/5/2012,"Beware!I always thought being treated poorly by waitstaff in scene-y restaurants was a bit of an urban myth. I have lived in New York for 16 years and I love to eat out. Naturally, I've encountered snooty staff, but until this week, I thought the ""Pretty Woman"" scenario was a fictional exaggeration of the snotty sales/waitstaff person. I'm disappointed and shocked to learn that this is not the case. There are, in fact, actual human beings who seek to degrade others by way of manufactured elitism. One said person works for LureFishbar.I made a reservation for two at Lure to celebrate my boyfriend's birthday. Seafood is his favorite so I wanted to find the best seafood plateau in New York and thought Lure might be the spot. I was really so excited about it, which makes the turn of events especially disheartening.  We showed up exactly on time (6:30 on a Monday night) to find a somewhat empty restaurant. We were seated immediately...at the bar! Of course I asked the host if we could sit in the dining room with the other 8 people eating. He said, ""sure."" I looked at the banquette tables (all but one were empty) and asked to sit there. It was a special occasion, the place was empty, and I really wanted that plateau to be center stage. He replied, ""Yeah. That's not gonna happen."" He took us to a table by the bathroom, pointed to the banquettes and said, ""Those tables are spoken for.""Mortified and humiliated, I sat there trying to pretend this didn't happen because it was a birthday celebration. Then I saw the occupied table open up.  Soon after, the host seated a couple from the bar in one of the banquettes. The rest remained open. I couldn't take it anymore, nor quietly accept the appalling treatment that I had done nothing to deserve.I approached the podium to ask the host why he said what he did. I expected a simple apology and an attempt to move us. Everyone has bad days! Maybe he was just cranky and taking it out on me. I don't know him, so I knew it was not personal. I did not get an apology. Instead, it got worse.The host lied to my face and told me that I (and my boyfriend) misheard him. I couldn't believe he was lying! We went back and forth and then he said something about not liking how I asked to be moved from that ""great table"" in the bar. By now the damage was done and we were getting nowhere. I asked to speak to the manager to let her know what had transpired. And then I left, no seafood plateau is that good.I looked around the website and I'm pretty sure the host was Albert Ragusa. I can see that he has been with Lure since the opening. As such, I'm sure he is a part of the ""family.""

3.0,9/3/2012,"First, the most important part of a meal - the drinks. And yes, they were great. At leas  I ordered the dulce caliente and it came as this pink martini. If you're a dude and you order it, it'll come as a more masculine-looking drink in a tumbler. The blackberry sage was also great. Of course, you can't eat here without having the oysters - raw, b/c cooked is really just not as delicious. I thought the soleils were much more tasty than the kushi, which seemed very mellow. The lobster ravioli appetizer was also great - not overly cheesy, as many raviolis tend to be. The red snapper was tender and flaky, and the thai curry sauce it came in was well-flavored, though a bit salty. I didn't end with a dessert, though I did hear that the chocolate peanut butter brittle pie was mediocre. And the chocolate covered pretzel it came with was stale, which is sad. Service was great.

5.0,8/12/2012,"My first visit to Lure was memorable because there was about 20 old college friends in the private wine vault. The amount of wine consumed is really what I remember of the night, not so much of the prix fixe menu and branzino that I had.Fast forward nearly two years to last night when I got to taste several dishes off the menu and enjoy (and remember) it responsibly with a glass of Malbec. As others have noted the decor is modeled after the inside of a yacht - not that I would really know what the inside of a yacht looks like. Our reservation was for 6:45 on a Saturday and the place was relatively empty which was refreshing. On to the food...My girlfriend and I shared everything we ordered so we were able to try several different items, first course was a few Bluepoint oysters and Littleneck clams and a spicy scallop roll. The raw bar was delicious and fresh and the spicy scallop roll was amazingly full flavored.Next up was the shrimp tempura and one of the specials - squid salad. The shrimp's portion was surprisingly large and the spicy mayo it was smothered in was great without being overpowering. The shrimp was a little overcooked for the first negative points of the evening. The squid was tasty but the greens it was paired with were a little too minty for my taste.The entree we shared was the yellowfin tuna, an Asian-inspired dish with soba noodles, mushrooms, lotus root and peanut sauce. After the minor disappointment of the shrimp and squid I was beginning to get a little nervous that this dish was going to have some element that I wouldn't love - not the case. The tuna was cooked perfectly (medium-rare - the ""chef's recommendation"" per our waitress) and the rest of the dish was delicious - my only regret was sharing it with the old lady.Finally I have to give them props on the service, our server really took care of us and the busboys were very attentive and professional. Our waitress really understood what we wanted and brought out the squid salad and entree split into two plates and gave us advice whenever we asked or seemed to want it.Food - 4.5 starsAmbiance/Decor - 4 starsService - 5 stars",0,1,0,David G.,"Maywood, NJ",47,145,28

The oysters were good, and unlike Lydia C., I definitely preferred the West Coast oysters. The crispy shrimp tempura were somewhat surprising, in that they didn't look like normal tempura. Still very tasty, but definitely... unique.For entrees, we got the cod and branzino. The branzino was definitely better - the sear was delicious and the pairing with beet risotto was perfect. The cod was merely ok. It was cooked well, but compared with the branzino, it lacked flavor. Definitely a healthier choice though.For dessert, we had the warm chocolate cake and the blueberry crumble. The warm chocolate cake (with salted caramel sauce!) was amazing.

A friend secured reservations for a Saturday night, so I was definitely up for it. I ordered the fried oysters, dragon rolls and 2 cocktails. I was quite satisfied. My friend ordered the filet Mignon and quite frankly this overcooked piece left a lot to be desired. No bueno. You should definitely stick to the fish and seafood options. The ambiance is nice and you feel as though you are in a ship since the restaurant is below ground and has those circular windows that are so common on ships. This Ofcourse allowed for drunk people passing by to moon patrons as they passed by, but I can't put the restaurant at fault for this interruption of my dinner. The music is quite hip and makes the restaurant pretty lively, so I guess this infraction was made up for.

2.0,7/24/2012,"Lure Fishbar was recommended by a friend. We made reservations for a group of 6 for our friend's birthday dinner. We got there on time, but our whole party wasn't there yet so we waited by the car and ordered drinks. Really creative and delicious-sounding drinks (and that they were!). They were very good, but you can't taste the alcohol at all. It was like drinking juice so I would NOT recommend getting drinks there. Seems just like a waste. We were finally seated at a cute semi-circle booth seating. The waitress seemed really nice, asked us if we wanted any drinks. No one else did so she started to take away the wine glasses...at which point she dropped one against the table and completely shatters it. Her immediate reaction was to turn to the table NEXT to us and asked if they were ok THEN she turned to our table and asked if we were ok. We all had to get out of the table and were moved to a different table (I later found little pieces of glasses inside my shoes cutting me). We were fine with moving even though we were being moved to a smaller table. What we weren't ok with was the beginning of a terrible service. We sat down for quite some time before anyone at all came by our table to give us menus or take our drink orders. We assumed that since glass was shattered on us that they would make up for it by providing us with extra care and attention. We asked the busboy (?) or waiter for menus. He brought ONE. We asked for 5 more, he brought a couple more. Finally our waitress shows up and we asked for more menus and water..to which she responded (with attitude), ""Umm I was just about to come here and ask you if you wanted tap or bottle."" Could she not have responded with ""yes""? A lot more waiting passes by and she comes to take our order.West coast oysters - a mix of 3 different types, they were all really good.Roasted scallops - came with pork belly, sweet pea ravioli, and pickled onion. Scallop was cooked perfectly, pork belly was salty, but delicious. Sweet pea ravioli was ok, not bad, but not a standout. The pickled onions were good additions to the dish because it helped cut some of the salty flavor. Overall, I would recommend this dish. Steamed cod - my friend ordered this and I had a few bites. It was good. Definitely has some asian influences in the dish. Served with rice. My friend said she wished the dish was a little less acidic as it drenched the rice and she couldn't taste anything else. Seared tuna - my other friend got seared tuna, which I thought was good, but everything else paled in comparison to the scallops (or maybe I'm just biased)Warm chocolate cake - served with salted caramel ice cream, caramel popcorn, chocolate pudding. So good. Definitely recommend this. The warm chocolate cake just melts in your mouth. The salted caramel sauce was saltier than my friend would have liked, but I really liked it. The popcorn gave a nice textural contrast.Ice cream sandwiches - great variety. All were really good as wellI would have rated this higher, but the service was just awful. The waitress barely checked on us. Very difficult to find her. She had kind of an attitude. The busboys (or waiters?) were way too eager to clear the table. On SEVERAL occasions, they tried to remove plates from the table when we weren't done eating. And they kind of stand around watching us eat.

5.0,7/19/2012,"We went here for the first time yesterday for Restaurant Week since I read online that this place serves a great dinner. We weren't disappointed by the meal and the location. Lure Fishbar looks fantastic, it was trendy and comfortable with lots of people surrounding us. It wasn't as secluded as some would have liked, but there was decent space between tables and there was a feeling of seclusion for me. I like restaurants bustling with life, hence I didn't mind. Must make a reservation because the place really is packed. Booking a seat a week in advance still couldn't get us the seven o'clock dinner slot.Service was great, they were all attentive though we did have a little problem with trying to get her attention after we were done deciding, however she was nice and made helpful suggestions. We had a small problem with our crab cakes not arriving even after our entree came, we told the waiters and they immediately cracked down on the problem and got it out quickly. We ordered from both the restaurant week menu and their regular menu and the food was great. I had a rock shrimp tempura with spicy mayo, I believe, and it was delicious. Spicy mayo wasn't too spicy and it was crispy. The shrimp was fresh and the portion was perfect for a small appetizer. Crab cakes were great. Slight tint of coconut in the crust which was perfectly done. The crab was great, packed with crab meat. What really got me was my Atlantic Salmon, grilled perfectly. It was slightly overcooked, but it was still delicious! The crust was great and, once again, I have to emphasize the seafood was fresh. Everybody else, I forgot what they ordered, thought their food was delicious too. Seared Brazino, I heard, was a little too salty, but fantastic nevertheless. My sister ordered the soft shell crab hand roll, and she enjoyed it, saying it was very well done.Desert was... awesome. Our warm chocolate cake was filled with flavor and the caramel ice cream complimented the cake perfectly. Being a big fan of chocolate, it was heaven for my taste bud. It was a perfect way to end dinner. Definitely coming back soon, in fact we booked a reservation for a week later. Friendly staff, great food, and nice decor. restaurant week was also a hit as others mentioned before. it is definitely a place I'm coming back to in the future.",0,0,0,Tiffany L.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,3,0
1.0,7/19/2012,"Lure Fishbar quite possibly has the worst service in the city. The host was rude and condescending (pretty entertaining considering he was wearing a bowling shirt) and informed us at 7:10 that we were ""very early"" for our 7:15 reservation and would have to wait 15-20 minutes. We were finally seated about 15 minutes after our reserved time and were seated in the bar area instead of the actual dining room. It was deafeningly loud and we were shoved into a corner table. Our waitress appeared to either be bored and incredibly dumb or heavily sedated. We ordered shortly after sitting down and she seemed totally confused and overwhelmed by our order (two appetizers, two main courses. No alterations or special requests). She stood by the table for a good two minutes after we ordered before wandering off. Our appetizers came out and before we were halfway through them two busboys came over and attempted to take our plates. We corrected them and they walked about two feet away from us and they proceeded to stare at us until the plates were empty, literally removing the plates the moment we had put the last bite into our mouths. Same thing happened with the main course. The wine list is lacking and the two champagnes by the glass were AWFUL. Food was fresh and very good but the service was appalling. My friend and I were both born and raised in the city and have been to tons of restaurants in the city, in every category and price range.

Robert, the manager, is warm and welcoming. He always remembers my family and does his best to seat us right away. The service is almost white glove, fitting in with the theme of luxury 1900s ocean liner. Must haves are any of their mojitos, bloody mary royale with oyster shooter, anything from the raw bar, and the SHRIMP TEMPURA. Unlike any tempura I've ever tried. The sauce is the perfect balance of umami and sweet, and the black sesame seeds complement the nutiness of the panko. It is a fairly expensive place, so save it for a special occasion or just go for appetizers and drinks (the best things on the menu anyway). Bottom line: eat here, even if you just go for a strawberry mojito and shrimp tempura.

5.0,6/25/2012,"Could this be my favorite seafood restaurant in the city? Is it possible? After eating here last Saturday everything seems to point towards a resounding yes. On a Saturday night obviously very busy, nice crowd, maybe just one big B&T table easily identifiable by their loudness and the amounts of burger & fries they had ordered - but hey, can't stop people from wanting to go to awesome restaurants. Killed wait time for our table by sipping grapefruit martinis at the bar - one of  the few bars that is actually sufficiently separate from the dining area so that a crowd 4-5 people deep can chill without being gang-rushed by scurrying waiters. The separation is cunningly achieved by a low wall so that you can still enjoy the restaurant vibe though. And the decor reminiscent of the inside of a yacht is splendidly pulled off with wooden interiors, a vaulted ceiling, and portholes for windows. Time for dinner: 6 oysters on the half shell for me, waitress recommendation is spot one. As is for the wine and the entree, a grilled whole daurade with a tasty Mediterranean-style accompaniment of dill gnocchi and tomatoes. My friend, a food snob, had the scallops and loved them too.

Everyone got the lobster roll ($29), which came with potato chips, salad, or fries, and a little coleslaw and pickle. The lobster roll had nice flavor, good chunks of meat, right proportion of mayo, and a large toasty bun. It was exactly how it should be, nothing more, nothing less. I still really prefer Mary's Fish Camp, but this was good.I tried my mom's fries, which were completely average, but I opted to get a salad with mine. The side salad was actually really good. It had a really tangy vinaigrette, and was a low cylinder, held together and wrapped with thin cucumber slices. It's so easy for restaurants to just throw some mixed greens and balsamic on a plate, so I was happy to see some effort. The pickle was not garlicky enough though. I'd definitely like to come back for dinner. I am not a sushi-snob, so I would like to try some of the rolls or sashimi, as a lot looked interesting.

Best avocados ever used in anything ever... ever... and this is coming from someone who grew up in CA. This flavorful experience was equivalent to rolling around on a thousand rabbits wearing chinchilla coats. I am not over-reacting. It was freakin' delightful. Avocado!

Beneath the crispy skin on the head, there are two pockets of cheek meat, which are the most tender and delicious parts of the fish. It was awesome! The fish is rather large and with a whole fish, you're really getting two filets, which is quite a lot of food actually. So it was totally worth it. The herbs de provence was spot on.

We ordered a side of sausage to go with it since the platter didn't include meat. The egg white omelet with spinach was delish, but the toast was slightly too dry. The service was good, but definitely could have been a bit more friendly.  In their defense, it was brunch and it was crowded but it still felt like there was something missing.

1.0,3/1/2012,"I had dinner here on a Monday night during the last week of Restaurant Week. I had originally made a reservation for 2, my boyfriend and I. But since friends of ours decide to join us, I changed my reservations to 4 and the only time they could accommodate us was at 915pm! I give em' a star for at least filling in my request last minute. ... but other than that, really I was pretty disappointed in my experience after hearing raves about this place. Didn't turn out as I had expected, unfortunately.I agree with Jeff T. that service was definitely lacking, and inhospitable! Upon entering the entrance of Lure, I, dumbfounded, stood in front of the hostess stand, waiting to be greeted. There they were, two girls at the desk as hostess who I am sure has already acknowledged that someone has entered the front doors, but nonetheless, did not bother to welcome me, or even smile at me! HA.. I stood there for quite some time till the point I was pretty infuriated. YA, honestly I expect the hostess to greet me, I mean it is their job. (I was a hostess for some time during my high school years so I know what the job entitles.) Then, finally I stepped on it, and greeted myself. ""Good evening ladies, how are you tonight? My name is Jenn and I have a reservation for 9:15pm. I'm a little earlier than expected, so is there something that you can do to help me out?"" Finally, one of them spoke! ... ---When my boyfriend and I were seated being that we were here before the other couple, we took a look at the RW menu, and not that I mind, but Lure did not offer anything that didn't have to do with fish. I understand that it is a seafood/fish restaurant, but I would expect that they would probably have one option for a non-fish person. I'm sure not everyone LOVES fish. Because one of my friend certainly didn't like fish at all. But luckily he's one heck of a fella. He hates cooked fish, because of the fishiness smell, but he doesn't mind eating raw fish therefore he opted for the sushi platter..We had ordered the raw platter sampling and tuna tartar as appetizer. I was pretty disappointed with the tartar. It was lacking flavor. I've definitely had better. Lure, you better step up your game a bit. The raw bar tasting (east/west coast oyster, and shrimp cocktail) was actually pretty good for a RW menu item and considering I was totally disappointed with the tartare to begin with. The oysters were pretty fresh. For entrees, we had the sushi platter, steamed cod, and seared yellowfin tuna. Sushi? Not top quality on my list. I think Lure passes for sushi but it definitely isn't worth $30-40 for a platter for one person. I've had better. But then again, I have to keep in mind, it was Monday night, and fish-delivery is normally on Thursday. The steamed cod was very silky but it was bland! The portion was tiny too! It was barely the size of my palm. Honestly, off all, I think I enjoyed the seared yellowfin tuna the most. The tuna was seared just right on top of a bed with soba noodles mixed in with peanut sauce, mushroom and lotus roots. The only complaint about this dish, the peanut sauce was a bit tad too overwhelming. Next time, ask for the chef to go easy on the sauce, unless you like your noodles saucy and hearty!Dessert, it was standard. Chocolate cake. What can go wrong? --- Anyways.. at the end of the night, after a average dinner, you didn't think anything could go wrong, not until the check came. When we looked at it a bit closer, we realized we were charged gratuity of 18%! I WAS APPALLED! We were a party of 4! Not 6, but 4! My boyfriend said that they probably thought we were tourists from China and just to be safe, they charged us. That was definitely not a cool way of thinking it, because we all ordered and spoke in english. I'm sure I sound fluent in english.. haha. but what was upsetting is that they didn't even bother to mention or point out that they already charged gratuity! Had they hoped that we missed the charge and tip on top it? I'm in the service industry so I don't how the tricks of this works. ... sigh, sad. I would've definitely left a 20% tip. Oh well, sucks for you.",3,0,2,Jenn N.,"Oakland Gardens, NY",5,25,7
5.0,3/1/2012,"I just had lunch at this place (literally, three hours ago), and it was fantastic.  A client of mine suggested it for a business lunch, and I am so glad they did.  First off, this restaurant is actually below street level, so this plays nicely with their decor theme-the whole place is done up like the inside of a boat (think wood paneling and warmth).  When you first walk in, you feel the comfortable vibe, like you could see yourself staying here a while.  The staff, including at the bar and host stand, are all extremely friendly and unpretentious.  Now let's talk about the food.  We started with three appetizers, all of which were amazing.  Shrimp tempura was my favorite.  It looked pan fried ratehr than deep fried, and unlike most tempuras, it was only dusted with flour-no thick batter to drown out the flavor of the shrimp.  It was also presented in this amazing sauce that was kind of like a spicy aioli, and oh man, I could eat that for hours.  The fried calamari was as good as you'd expect, nothing too crazy, but it was clearly fresh.  We also ordered the smoked salmon pizza, which was like the best combination of pizza and bagel since you know what.  Then my entree was the mahi mahi tacos, and they were so good I could cry.  They served three on a place, but I was stuffed after just two.  My dining companions each ordered something different (tuna burger, fish and chips, and salad of the day), and they all loved what they had, too.  Each meal looked delicious and freshly prepared, and the portions were generous.   Add all of this on top of the fact that right when I decided I loved this place, Lovin' Touchin' Squeezin' came on the restaurant sound system, and really threw me over the edge.I can't wait to come back here.  Fully reccommended!",0,0,0,Dina L.,"Sausalito, CA",36,19,0
3.0,2/28/2012,"I came here for a post birthday dinner last week with a party of 6. Originally, I wanted to go to Crispo, but there doesn't seem to be many restaurants willing to seat more than 5 in the area. We mingled around at the bar for some minutes before seating, taking in the decor and atmosphere. I must say that the cruise like decor is somewhat charming. Before I start talking about the food, I must say that I do find their staff being more attentive and hospitable to their older clientele. This is especially prevalent during earlier periods of service. We are their future patrons after all. You'd expect better treatment. Who else is going to dining here after Senior Senior over there passes away?Anywho, the food was magnificent. The standout was the baked cod, which came served on top of some mashed potatoes in a butter sauce. The fish itself was perfect, lightly browned on the outside, with the inside being exceedingly buttery. Aside from that, I also had the calamari appetizer and the warm lemon pudding cake; both enjoyable as well. As for the others', they also gave the food top marks. Despite the raves about the decor and food, I feel apprehensive about coming back. Although, the service was not entirely offensive, it was still lacking, and cold. This holds true from my greeting the hostess (yes, I had to greet her), who is by far the worst hostess I've ever had the displeasure of speaking to, through dinner. I suppose I'll receive a warm welcome if I returned a few years down the road, but with this in memory, it's unlikely. *If I based the score solely on the food, it would be a 5, but it's hard to rate anything higher than a 3 when the staff does the bare minimum.*",5,3,4,Jeff T.,"Brooklyn, NY",131,141,41
4.0,2/24/2012,"During my favorite time of the year in NYC (Restaurant Week!), my bf and I decided to eat here based on a few friends' reviews and recommendations. I made the reservations a couple of weeks in advance for lunch one weekday afternoon via Opentable.com. We arrived half an hour early that day and they had no problems seating us. I loved the décor of the place, you really did feel like you were on a ship, just without the motion sickness! The crowd was a good mix of everything, tourists/non-tourists, older crowd/younger crowd, couples/families, etc. The place can definitely get noisy so I'm not sure if this would be a good place to take a date. Often times, we found it difficult to understand/hear the waitress, but that might also be cause she just spoke softly. Our waitress sat us down and handed us the menus with the restaurant week options. I ordered the Clam Chowder for my appetizer, the Grilled Salmon for my entrée, and the S'mores Sundae for my dessert. The Clam Chowder was very good. Not as thick and creamy as I expected, but still delicious. It had great seafood flavor and the pieces of Clam were very fresh. The Grilled Salmon came with Spatzle, Truffled Onions, Brussel Sprouts, and Bacon. This was a big portion. The Salmon was perfectly cooked and was moist and juicy. I loved the sweet Truffled Onions and the saltiness of the bacon with the fresh tasting Salmon. My bf and I ended up switching our plates a few times so we could try each other's dishes. I ate a great deal of his Sushi and I know he enjoyed my Salmon dish too. The S'mores Sundae was put together very creatively. It came with the Graham crackers and chocolate syrup, however I didn't see any Marshmallows, but my bf helped point out that the ice cream was Marshmallow flavored. It threw  me off because it wasn't white ice cream which is what I would guess for it to look like, but it was probably chocolate marshmallow flavored ice cream. All together, it worked and I def got the S'mores flavor in that little bowl!Nice dining experience and great value for a RW lunch!",2,0,2,Melissa D.,"Matawan, NJ",403,501,745
2.0,2/19/2012,"Restaurant week review. Went with a crowd of 11 gorgeous execs, doctors, lawyers, and just great gals on the last Friday night of RW. We were seated in the back by the liquor and raw bar, a cool spot for us and we had view of the restaurant behind us. It was live, music being 80s and 90s pop, over all an upbeat happenin atmosphere. We were off to the side, so with all this said, why would the head chef come to our table and tell us to tone it down? Not really sure, but definitely taken aback seeing as we blended in with the place. Someone actually complained about our noise level... really? Are you on Yelp, can you tell me who you are? The chef was a rather rolly polly loud kinda guy as well. So that definitely put a damper on our experience of the place. Onto the food... I loved the raw appetizer. It was what I wanted and expected. My entree of tuna with the soba noodles, didn't taste special. I heard the other entrees were delicious, the cod and the salmon. Dessert was good, but pretty carbon copy to other molten chocolate cakes. Theirs' does have the candy popcorn which vamps it up.

Had a nice bite/kick to it with just a touch of sweetness.3) Soho Moonshine (moonshine whiskey, ginger elderflower & lime): another great drink. A little too sour for what I was in the mood for, but it was pretty good.Appetizer:1) Raw Bar Tasting: East & West Coast Oysters, Shrimp Cocktail: not bad considering it was RW2) Yellowtail Carpaccio (garlic chili sauce, sesame oil, avocado, crispy shallots): Not included in RW menu but wanted to try it. Presentation was nice, but it was overall okay.Entrees:1) Black Bass: It was on their special menu, but was allowed to be substituted in for RW. It was a little salty, but was pretty good.2) Steamed Cod (Oyster Mushrooms, Scallions, Ponzu, Cilantro)3) Seared Yellowfin Tuna (Soba Noodles, Thai Peanut Sauce, Mushrooms, Lotus Root)4) Grilled Salmon (Spatzle, Truffled Onions, Brussels Sprouts, Bacon)- each dish was either on the salty side or bland side. The cod was probably the best one out of all the dishes.Dessert:1) Warm Chocolate Cake (caramel ice cream, candied popcorn): was really good!

The shrimp was ok, pretty dry though.The seared tuna entree was bland and the soba noodles and lotus root and mushroom side was all just weird and tasted like a weird pile of leftovers they just threw together.The chocolate cake dessert tasted like it was done by an amateur.

The cod was in an incredibly salty sauce and everything else seemed... uninspired.3) The ship theme of Lure extends to the lack of elbow space at a table for two.4) It was loud, but romantically lit by candles... which is good for  people who look like me.5) If OpenTable doesn't have any open reservations, just give them a call and they'll hook you up.6) I didn't know what Hitachino White beer is, still don't, but I liked it.7) The busboys REALLY like to rearrange your flatware.8) There's also not a lot of elbow room between urinals in the men's room.

To be a fair judge I'd have to go back during dinner, but I will say their lunch service was absolutely impeccable. I haven't a single complaint.We were seated immediately in a very roomy booth that could have sat five, and took in the elegant yacht furnishings over mineral water, oysters, steamed cod, and salmon--all utterly delicious. Later we had coffee and tea, chocolate cake and a smore sundae--so decadent! The oysters and chocolate cake with candied popcorn and caramel ice cream were the highlights for me, though my cod couldn't have been cooked or seasoned more perfectly. My friend couldn't shut up about the bacon in the salmon dish.The service was timed perfectly, and the waitstaff were neither overbearing or neglectful.

The lighting is very intimate and romantic, not to mention flattering...dimly lite...perfect to hide flaws and imperfections, especially when on a date. This would be wonderful spot for a first date.   It does get a big loud and at times. I found it difficult to talk and listen a few times, but nothing to the point where we couldn't conversate.The staff was great, extremely accommodating and pleasant! We were running way late than our booked reservations, (1 hour and 15mins!) But as soon as we were all there, they still seated us within minutes, whereas people who showed up with no reservations were told the wait is an hour or more. Most restaurants in NYC will NOT do you such kindness or honor your reservations if you're that late. So BIG kudos. The food was delish from beginning to end. The crispy shrimp tempura was just amazing. Seasoned and sauced up with just the right amount of flavor to awaken all your senses. I literally could have eaten that the whole night. Once you start, you can't stop! They had a special fish of the day that was added to the restaurant week menu. It was called something Char. The waiter told me it's similar to a Salmon. OMG! It was so buttery soft...melted away in my mouth. It was mixed in with this creamy yogurt sauce...YUMS. The Jalapeño yellowtail sushi was quite good as well. Spicy enough to get the juices flowing. The warm chocolate cake was an explosion of sin and delight. Loved it. Now my favorite item for the entire night was the strawberry basil martini! It was more of a slurpie texture, which I slurped away in minutes, not realizing there's alcohol in it. I really felt like I was being whisked away on a ship to the Caribbean island as I'm downing my icy slushie delight one after another with no worries or cares about the time... just enjoying and taking in the view.

It's among the best we've seen, and surprising given the trendy nature of the restaurant that makes any New Yorker naturally brace themselves in preparation for haughty waiters and waitresses. The ambiance is trendy and nice for a couple or girlfriends in their mid-20s/30s to get together and have a good time on a Friday or Saturday. Doesn't hurt that their excellent cocktails help loosen up the atmosphere. As mentioned, food is average. Don't get me wrong, it is far from being offensive or bad. But it's just standard execution on standard dishes.

Like, makes you want to stand up and shout ""I'm on a boat, mothafucka,"" which I'm not going to lie, I totally did. And it rocked. Restaurant Week limits you to an extent, but since most of the stuff I had is on the menu full time, I feel comfortable writing this review out for you all. Meal: salmon tartare followed by the spicy tuna sushi combo (handrolls plus sashimi) and tied off at the end with the lemon pudding.The salmon tartare was great - loved the dill sauce that was spread around. I feel like I expected more from it, but ultimately was pleased. Not thrilled with it, but pleased. Sushi was incredible. Like, some of the best spicy tuna ever. Some people might ask how you'd fuck up spicy tuna, and I guess I don't really have an answer for them. All I know was this was fresh, quality sushi. The eel was a nice touch, too. and the dessert? Awesome. Not like a big ass pile of pudding, but more like a weird pudding meets cake. Whatever it was, it owned.Like other reviewers, I think they need to work on the pacing of the service. Too much time in between courses, and my waitress definitely should have come over BEFORE our dessert came to ask us if we wanted coffee or tea. Who wants coffee or tea after dessert?

5.0,12/5/2011,"Lure Fishbar was simply sensational.  Everything I had the pleasure of trying at dinner was shockingly delicious.  The lobster croutons were as exquisite as everyone raves about on Yelp.  My favorite appetizer was hands-down the Salmon Tartare but Crab Cakes did not fall too far behind in favor.  For my main dish, I simply had the Lobster Tempura Roll, which melted in the mouth and was absolutely amazing.  I also had the luck of trying bites of the Roasted Scallops & Bucatini Pasta, Steamed Red Snapper, Lobster Roll, Baked Halibut and Seared Yellowfin Tuna with zero complaints and only compliments.  Note to all: if you are going to visit Lure, make sure you go with a lot of generous friends who will share around their food for a full experience.The service was more than amazing.  The waitress was responsive and prompt, as well as pleasant to interact with in every moment that we were there.The ambience is great for a group.  It is on the noisier side so there is no shyness about talking amongst a large group of people.  The lighting is dim but sufficient.  The inside is designed to emulate the inside of a boat.  As my friend mentioned, it is amazing how the restaurant is designed so that the place did not feel closed in considering it is situated on a sub-level with a limited strip of small windows--no small feat.I would surely revisit this restaurant.  Though it is a pricier choice for dinner, it is worth every little bit of the cash (especially if you eat like a little bird like me, you will leave with a full belly).",0,0,0,Joyce G.,"Manhattan, NY",12,3,0
4.0,12/5/2011,"I came here on a Friday during happy hour (Mon-Fri 5-7pm) to enjoy some oysters at the bar. Unfortunately the only oysters available during HH are Blue Point ($1.50). For what it lacks in terms of oyster variety, however, the HH menu makes it up by offering many other items, including Littleneck clams ($1), crispy calamari in a smoked chili glaze ($6), shrimp tempura ($7), and lobster croutons ($9).We ordered a platter of 12 oysters and 12 clams. The bivalves are perfectly shucked to keep as much of their juices as possible, and I like my mollusks juicy. Blue Points can vary a lot in flavor from batch to batch, ranging from tasty to bland. These ones were certainly good: creamy and briny, flavorful and firm. The Littleneck clams were also excellent: a nice pink color, firm meat, and an intense sea flavor of salt and iodine.The HH menu also offers 4 cocktails at $8. My Dark & Stormy was perfect: just the right combination of flavor and strength. The beer selection is dishearteningly skimpy: Kirin Light, Brooklyn Lager, and Corona (all at $5).If you want to sit at the bar during HH, come here early: the bar is always busy, mainly with a business-like crowd. Keep in mind that there is a second bar located at the back of the restaurant.Overall, 3 1/2 stars. If you are mainly interested in a HH that offers different oysters, you may want to look elsewhere. If you're interested in a HH that offers oysters, small plates, and good cocktails, then Lure is certainly solid.",15,7,15,Matteo R.,"Brooklyn, NY",703,698,3183

Tempura shrimp was amazing - gently fried, painted with a lightly-spiced mayo sauce and dusted with black sesame seeds. My group also loved the calamari, though I personally didn't care for the sauce it was glazed in (kind of sweet, kind of bitter).On the down side, the waitstaff got a little rude at the end when we lingered at the bar tables past happy hour - that was a bit annoying (didn't we just give you a $50 tip??).

Salmon/Avacado roll -this is the exact type of roll you can find in a sushi restaurant for $4 yet this place charges $9. Oysters -They were pretty standard too, nothing outstanding.Again, this review is a bit bias since I didn't really come here to get the good stuff like the crab, lobster, etc. However, it just seems overpriced for all the standard dishes that I don't really get what's the point.

It was quite soggy and there wasn't enough fat in the choice of salmon they used.  Nothing special about it. No kick to it nor any sauce that made you want to lick the plate.The crispy calamari was nice.  The smoked chili glaze added a nice kick to it. I enjoyed the sauce. The fried calamari was a little soggy.  Overall, I liked the sauce a lot and it was the redeeming factor for this dish.The seared yellowfin tuna was on the dry side and chewy. I couldn't believe that at a fishbar, the meat was cooked/prepared better than the fish.The aged sirloin was good.  Definitely better than the fish dish. It was a nice big piece of sirloin. It was a little chewy but I didn't mind it all because it tasted good.My favorite meal of the evening was the almond plum crumble.  It wasn't too sweet. I could taste the subtle almond even though I would have liked it to be more, and some contrast with tart flavor from the plum.

4.0,10/14/2011,"Nice happy hour especially if you love oysters. My friend and I had an oysterfest there complete with raw oysters, fried oysters and oyster shooters. The raw oysters were nicely briney and tasty and only $1.50 each. The fried oysters were served 4 to an order and each were on a bed of a slaw with the slightest hint of coconut. This was delicious and highly recommended. The oyster shooters were a nice surprise and perfect if you like bloody marys. I would recommend them marinating a little bit before taking them, the brininess of the oysters infuses that nice flavor throughout the bloody mary. Overall, this is a perfect spot for happy hour and if you get there early enough (by 5pm or so) you can snag a seat in the lounge tables next to the bar till 7pm. That is more than enough time to gorge on a ton of oysters. :)Service is a bit hit or miss, however.

I was suspicious that - given the restaurant location and reputation -we would NEVER be seated as walk-ins... how wrong I was! Literally two minutes after walking through the doors were were seated comfortably with menus and adult beverages on the way. Sure, we were seated at the sushi bar but who cares? We were sitting and there was the promise of alcohol. The drinks were a good sign of the deliciousness to come. My friend had a fresh watermelon martini a.k.a. a sophisticated version of the boozy BBQ staple, watermelon soaked with vodka. It was classy without losing some of the picnic table charm of watermelon.I had something called the Soho moon... aptly named as it's made with legit moonshine. Seriously, I expect that the alcoholic part of this drink comes from a jug with three x's on it. Delicious and it made my belly warm. Then... the main event. The fish is perfection - I had two pieces of salmon sashimi that legit melted in my mouth and a roll (think it was the Lure Roll?) that was out of this world. The best part? Sitting at the sushi bar. For one, I could watch the frequency of deliveries from the kitchen to the bar -- it was phenomenal. Every five minutes, someone came out of the kitchen with just fried tempura shrimp for the rolls. If that's not a sign of how this places runs itself, then I don't know what is.

Looked like the inside of a yacht. They were also playing dance-y pop music which was perfect for our partying mood. It might have been a little loud for an intimate, serious dinner, but it was fine for us.Appetizers: The salt and vinegar chips were delicious and addicting.  We also had some raw tuna tacos (tiraditos?) that were very flavorful and had a surprisingly spicy kick. The lobster croutons were also tasty and perfectly sized for one yummy bite.  The fried calamari was interesting because the sauce was already on the calamari - i.e. no dipping necessary. I thought the sauce was a little funky, so it wasn't my favorite dish. I think I just prefer old school tomato-based sauces for my fried calamari.Entree: The lobster roll had a good balance of mayo and lobster, and was overall a very good lobster roll, but the actual amount of lobster was not as much as some other places in the city. I had the seared tuna with warm soba noodles. I thought the use of lotus root and nuts gave the dish a good contrast in terms of texture, and the tuna was seared perfectly. The mushrooms in the dish were a little too vinegary for my taste but I guess it was supposed to balance out the peanut sauce.Service: I think they didn't want to disturb us so, besides the manager, the service wasn't all that attentive.

The shrimp were great too.-Sushi combo with spicy tuna roll: Deliciously fresh sushi and a great spicy tuna roll to boot. They also gave enough food that I was not hungry afterward like I sometimes am with RW sushi meal offerings (cough Nobu). Great salmon!-Chocolate cake: Delicious molten chocolate cake with a liquid center and ice cream on the side.

4.0,8/24/2011,"It was restaurant week in New York, and I was busy reserving restaurants on Seamless Web.  Lure Fishbar was one of the places that a friend recommended, and after glancing briefly at their menu, quickly reserved the place.Lure Fishbar honestly has one of the best New York restaurant week menus.  Their portions are not at all downsized as many other restaurants do, so that was a plus.  Their restaurant week specials also encompass a wide variety of dishes from their regular menu, so you get a real sense and taste of the restaurant for a fraction of the price.I started off my meal with the six raw oysters, which were fresh and soft.  Though I said I would only eat one or two to save room for the rest of the meal, I ate all six.  Then came my entrée, the steamed branzino, which was equally delicious.  The ponzu sauce really did penetrate the fish so that each bite was even.  The oyster mushrooms were cooked to a slight dry chewiness, which added a lot of texture to the dish.  Meanwhile, the scallion and cilantrol really seemed to round off the flavor to keep the ponzu sauce from going too wild.  The dish came with a side of rice, also so perfectly seasoned with spices and ponzu, that I ate the entire scoop of that as well.Then came dessert.  I ordered the cherry upside-down cake, which was good for a dessert, but nothing too memorable.  However, a few of my friends ordered the molten chocolate cake with the salted caramel ice-cream and caramel popcorn, and that was a huge hit.  Rich and dreamy, plus the salted caramel was good contrast to the sweet chocolate.  The crunchiness of the popcorn added in an extra kick, bringing the juxtaposition of textures and tastes in full swing.The restaurant is underground and is designed so that you really do feel like you are on a boat.  Another interesting thing to note is that there are a lot of Asians dining here.  In the middle of Soho, I actually expected a very diverse crowd, so was very surprised to find the place nearly all Asians.  In fact, that is what each of my friends said when they walked into the restaurant: ""Wow, this place is really Asian!""  It's quite ironic that we were meeting up for lunch for an Asian American Association family reunion from school. Lure Fishbar was delicious, but I have to take off one star when I got sick the next day, feeling extremely bloated without an appetite for anything.  I'm pretty sure it was from engulfing those six oysters...",0,0,0,Buggy Z.,"Cambridge, MA",242,307,748

We had a reservation, and they made us wait a little bit past it even though there were a few empty tables (that stayed empty throughout our meal). Weird.Other than that, it was amazing! The watermelon martini was just the right amount of sweet and just the right amount of liquor. I also had another drink, but don't remember what it was, so it must not have been that great. Drinks were normal price for soho.Now for the burger....it's not on the menu, but if you ask for it, they'll make it. It's called the ""bash burger"" and I don't even know what was on it (some sort of sauce or mashed up stuff...I think they waiter said there was mango in it?) but it was absolutely de-effing-licious. And skip lunch the day you decide to go for this burger because it's a good size - I only ate half - and it comes with a huge side of very fresh french fries...possibly the best fries I've had in NYC yet. The burger and fries were around $16 together.The service was great, we never had to search for the waiter, except to ask for the check, which I find to be commonplace in NYC anyway...The ambiance is cool, it feels like you are in a cruise ship..and it seemed to somehow balance being upscale but casual so perfectly that I didn't feel out of place in my skinny jeans and flip flops even though there were a few other patrons in much fancier attire.This place is definitely a must-try!",0,0,0,Shauna M.,"Boston, MA",19,27,1

I came here during summer 2011 restaurant week and it was the best restaurant week meal I've had. For appetizer I had the salmon tartare and it was very flavorful. Perfect start to a meal. For the entree I chose the steamed branzino which was cooked perfectly. The fish was so tender and soft. I had the chocolate lava cake dessert and that was good too. Me and my bf had an amazing time here.,0,0,0,Susan L.,"Brooklyn, NY",9,67,31

1.0,8/9/2011,I'm soooo disappointed with Lure! My boyfriend and I had been looking forward to eating there for awhile. I started with the lobster croutons and my bf with the roasted beet/goat cheese salad. My croutons were good not great. The salad was pretty good. I'm not a big fan of beets but I couldn't resist the goat cheese. It was great! We then ordered a small plateau to share. It consisted of 2 oysters 2 clams 2 mussels 2 shrimp and 4 snow crab claws. I was only really looking forward to the snow crab claws which were just ok. Although the oysters ( they didn't specify east or west) were fresh and delicious!! I looked at the menu before I arrived and didn't really find any of the entrees appetizing. I hoped when I got there that would change. It didn't. ( The menu is actually different online then in the restaurant). The seafood combinations are kinda weird! Grilled shrimp with short ribs?! No thank you! I decided on the roasted scallops. It was served with pasta and chorizo with tomato confit. Bf ordered the steamed branzino with oyster mushrooms and scallions. My scallops were sooo boring! I dragged my feet and practically forced myself to finish my food. The branzino was steamed whole so the skin was pale and actually looked pretty gross! We assumed it would be a filet. My bf was so grossed out he couldn't eat it. The staff were REALLY nice about it. Actually the manager noticed right away and without a mention from us he offered to have the skin removed. So I'm guessing that is a common complaint with the branzino. My bf declined. The manager insisted and instead brought out some freshly made crab cakes that were really good! And took the branzino off the check. Initially we decided we wouldn't return. But the staff was so apologetic we will give them a 2nd chance. Next time I think we'll just order from their sushi menu.,0,0,0,Janelle P.,"New York, NY",58,26,0

The decor really conveys the intended feeling of being on a fancy boat/yacht. The service here is beyond excellent, our waitress knew the menu like the back of her hand, which was quite helpful. Definitely try the Bellini cocktail and the Lobster Ravioli YUM! It IS kind of overpriced but it's the city can't expect anything other.

But I'm down to try new things, so Lure it is. Met her at her job where we take a walk past the party her bosses are having for some bankers and one of the workers invites us into a bank room to snack on some of the left overs. I grab a piece of sushi, lamb shank and a slider (that was very under done) then some lollipop breaded seafood thing. Sans the slider it was all delicious. Turns out it was all catered by Lure. Swell beginnings. We arrive at Lure, no reservation at 8:30pm. It's swarming with the too-cool people of Downtown Manhattan. Dimly lit and the bar is full. We put our name down for a table of two, and move over to the bar where we find a small standing space to order drinks. I ordered the Soho Moon, a refreshing moonshine whiskey tinged cocktail, that I remembered tasting very very good, and then feeling very very good right after. My friend had the Dulce Caliente a jalapeno tinged pomegranate margarita. Sits open up at the bar and we order a 2nd round, as I try the Pineapple Sage Daiquiri. Sweet. 45 minutes we're seated and the menu is too much for me. Far too many options, do I do sushi, apps, entree, oyster bar? Friend suggests the Steamed Branzino and takes away the pressure of me having to choice. We skip the sushi because we had some back at the office and it didn't really stand out for me. She orders the Lobster Ravioli. For apps we get the Fried Oysters and Crab Cakes. Then the waiter suggests sides, oh my. I quickly glance back over the menu and pick out the Garlic Spinach and Bacon Crusted Macaroni. The Fried Oysters were ah-maaazing!! Oysters is one of those shellfish that I'm fickle with it. They taste great, but I HATE the slimy texture of them. Frying them solves that issue perfectly and they weren't over fried or super greasy, as they were plated on the shell over colesaw so you still retained a similar experience to eating oysters. The crab cakes were fresh but I wish they were fried/baked a little bit more. On to the main course. Dem entrees! Branzino was smoky goodness, lobster ravioli was the bomb.com and that spinach had me feeling like Popeye. Nothing but goodness abounded till I hit the macaroni & cheese. Granted everything tastes better with bacon...but again the m&c failed me, IDK what lied beneath the bacon but it was reminiscent of my middle school cafeteria mac&cheese, over baked and just plain ehhhhh. But back to that spinach...I really was drooling over some garlic spinach. Great, great, great. Good drinks, good food.",1,1,0,Jasi B.,"Dallas, TX",75,118,19

4.0,7/21/2011,"I've been to Lure 2 times, once for happy hour and recently for Summer RW2011 lunch. Place was a bit hard to find the first time, since it is underneath the Prada store, but it is still roomy and beautiful. The restaurant seemed mostly filled with young, hip people, reflecting its chic and fashionable neighborhood, SoHo. When I went during lunchtime, the restaurant was quite full, and there was a nice amount of chatter. This is a perfect place to take a date if you want to be in a nice hip atmosphere where you wouldn't feel uncomfortable breaking the mood of the restaurant by striking up a convo. Dishes I had were great. I had the oyster tasting for appetizer, steamed branzino for entree and homemade ice-cream sandwiches for dessert. I love raw bar, and without restaurant week, oysters & clams run about $1~1.50 each during happy hour (regularly priced at around $3~). I've heard good things about their clam chowder (which is also available as a RW appetizer) but I haven't had the opportunity to try it yet. The steamed branzino was tender and flavorful. The homemade ice-cream sandwiches looked cute, but I preferred my date's choice of dessert, the chocolate cake (molten lava cake with a spoonful of icecream covered in caramel and caramel popcorn...delicious.) Waiter could've been more attentive and warm but given the amount of customers at the time I went, it was understandable.",1,0,1,Sophia C.,"New York, NY",265,59,24
5.0,7/21/2011,"After my CD release gig at the Bitter End (shameless plug: cdbaby.com/careyyaruss2) Gabriel and I decided to go celebrate with a cocktail and some seafood at Lure. I'd been there a few times for their $1 oyster happy hour, but never for anything else. We arrived to a full restaurant and were seated in a quiet, corner booth relatively quickly- just as soon as they could clear and re-set the table for us. No one gave us weirdo looks when we decided to sit on the same side next to each other. I often prefer 'next to' instead of 'across from', and I appreciated that they had actually set the table that way for us.It was a pleasant surprise to see that they were participating in restaurant week- my favorite NYC 'holiday' (which has apparently been extended into restaurant SUMMER and is continuing through the beginning of September!!! OH HAPPY NEWS!) where 3 course lunches are $25 and 3 course dinners are $35 at a ton of the city's restaurants. Since it was late and we didn't want to stuff ourselves, we decided to order drinks, one prix fixe meal to share and a side of garlic spinach.I had a strawberry/basil martini and it was STRONG. Then again, I was drinking on a mostly empty stomach. I intended to wait until I'd eaten a little bit before having a second sip. It was so delicious though, that I continued sipping on it before the food arrived. I can safely say that one cocktail was plenty for me.We started with a raw bar sampler which included 2 each of shrimp, blue point oysters and kumamoto oysters. All were succulent and with a squeeze of lemon hardly needed any of the vinaigrette or cocktail sauce that sat next to them on the platter. There was also a tartar sauce flavored with lemon and horseradish that was tasty, but I skipped it so as to taste the purity of the fresh seafood. Our main course was the sushi sampler, 8 pieces of sushi and one salmon/avocado roll. I have to comment on the awesome ginger that came with this. It wasn't the standard ginger, but a little bit thicker cut, fresher, and much more flavorful than most. We finished all of it before we even finished the sushi- which was also excellent. The spinach was a great accompaniment to our meal- even though It didn't really go with it. We wanted a little something green and it was garlickylicious and cooked perfectly- not at all soggy or buttery, just fresh and wonderful.For dessert we had the warm chocolate cake with salted caramel ice cream and popcorn brittle. Now I personally don't care at all that little, plain, round, warm, melty, chocolate cakes are no longer considered hip or cool enough to be at fine restaurants. Apparently, they are oh-so 90s ,but as far as I'm concerned, that is just snobby bullshit. It's a perfectly delicious piece of heaven. How can that possibly go out of style? I guess they add the trendy salted caramel ice cream as a more current touch, and it certainly was tasty- but as far as I'm concerned, warm, melty, chocolate things are always fine by me, with or without of-the-moment ice creams. Aside our cake sat the most decadent piece of dark chocolate, with 'congratulations' written on the top. Our waitress was rather awesome and sweet- giving me a big, heart-felt congratulations and asking me about my music. I was really touched that she was interested. How thoughtful is my awesome boyfriend to have mentioned to the waitress that it was a special night for me? Very very sweet. Just like my yummy dessert.",0,0,0,Carey Y.,"Sarasota, FL",407,338,3

Not usually a fan of restaurants underground but it was fine and I liked the fact it felt like I was inside a big boat.Our waitress was polite though biggest issue with the meal - they served our dishes one after another. Example, when the bus boys came to clear our appetizer dishes (maybe 60 seconds after putting fork/chopsticks down), another guy was there to immediately place my entree down. I don't know if it's because they were slammed for restaurant week but that is unacceptable.For the food, the raw bar tastings and tuna tartar were good. Nothing spectacular but solid. They do a very nice branzino. The tuna with vegetables and soba noodles was ok. Flavor wise it worked and the tuna was cooked to the right level but it wasn't the best grade I've had.Desserts - so so. Luckily I'm not a huge dessert person but I have been blown away recently (David Burke Townhouse, Fishtail, even Craftbar) so I feel they could step it up.Overall, I enjoyed my meal.

The good news......Had dinner here with a couple of friends last week during restaurant week. Very cool ambiance, good crowd, loved the interior- it's like the inside of a ship. Yummy selection of cocktails. We were seated at our table on time, and our waitress was there to go over the specials, drink options etc. I don't impress easily, but I was impressed by her attentiveness, here's why; there was 3 of us on a 4 top, I noticed as we sat that my water glass had lipstick stains on it, so I quietly switched it with the one at the place setting that wasn't occupied. As I did this, our waitress noticed, but within minutes was back with complimentary appetizers as an 'apology'. She did it so discretely that my other 2 dinner partners didn't even know what had happened. This is the message you get ""your experience matters to us, we care"". Wins you brownie points instantly!!

The shrimp tempura smelled good but different from typical japanese tempura. Main: mahi mahi fish taco: Which was so much better than I expected. The spicy mayo was really addicting, the mahi mahi wasn't overcooked and pineapple give a sweet edge, and cilantro wasn't too pronounced. The steamed branzino was really tender, like Chinese steamed fish, not big in portion though but flavorful. fish basket was ordinary.

5.0,7/15/2011,"2011 RESTAURANT WEEK REVIEW First, the decor of this place is awesome. I thought I written the address down wrong because I wasn't able to find it and then saw that it was under the Prada Store. You walk in and you feel like your inside a boat! It reminded me of being a cruise ship, right away I loved it. We arrived a few minutes before our reservation so we went to the bar and had a glass of Prosecco ($24 for 2). I was shocked at how busy this place was! Within a few minutes we were taken to our table. While the tables are a little on top of one another it was ... we'll say cozy! It was a little loud in there as well but you get passed it. From the regular menu we decided to order one of the Shellfish Plateaus, the small one ($25). 2 Oysters, 2 Shrimp, 2 Clams, 4 Crab Claws. The crab claws might have been my favorite. It came with three sauces, a cocktail sauce, a sauce that was something lime mayo and horseradish and then something very similar to a soy sauce. From the RW menu we ordered: Apps: Tuna Tartar tops with Avocado and crispy wontons in a chili sesame dressing. The tuna was so fresh and with the avocado on top and the accent from the dressing was out of this world. Full of flavor. Raw Bar Tasting: East & West Coast Oyster (4) and shrimp cocktail (4). This was very similar to the app we ordered off the regular menu. The oysters were extremely fresh. I'm not even a big fan of oysters but you could tell the different in the tastes of the east and west coast oysters. Entrees: Seared Yellowfin Tuna: Soba Noodles, Thai Peanut sauce, Mushrooms & Lotus roots. This dish was amazing, amazing, amazing!! While it took on the taste of a pad thai the flavor combo couldn't have been more right. The tuna was cooked but still a little pink and not tough. Again very fresh. If you go to Lure, you've got to get this ... out of this world!! Good work Lure! Grilled Salmon: Summer veggies, basil, roasted tomatoes, and pine nut tapenade. This dish was also very very good. It screams summer. It was so fresh and full of flavor. The salmon was cooked perfectly, and again it was very fresh. Dessert: Warm Chocolate Cake: Salted Carmel Ice Cream, Candied Popcorn. Whenever we saw that there was popcorn with the ice cream, we thought hrmm this is kind of odd. But the salty and sweet went together perfectly and danced around in your mouth!! The cake was extremely good and having it warmed the way it was made it even better. Ice Cream Sandwiches: chocolate chip cookie & vanilla ice cream Vanilla shortbread cookie & strawberry ice cream. Super simple and straight forward but more importantly delicious!! I like the chocolate chip one better though. We also ordered a really nice bottle of white wine from Spain, don't ask me what it was but it was light and fruity and accented our meal perfectly. The service was great and very attentive. The portion sizes were also very generous. Most places scale their portions back during RW so I was pleased to see that. I was extremely pleased with Lure Fishbar. I'm not one to go back to a restaurant twice but I would come back here again in heartbeat!! Even though we did come for RW, our bill was $160 which I didn't think was bad for having the app from the regular menu, 2 RW meals and then a bottle of wine. If you get the chance to go to Lure ... GO!!!",1,0,0,Lauren L.,"Astoria, NY",414,331,602
3.0,7/14/2011,"I wanted to love this place. I love the decor and the food was tasty but the portions were tiny and there were certain things I really disliked about our waitress. She was very prompt in taking our drink/dinner orders and delivered drinks within a few minutes of ordering. I was a little surprised when she poured herself some wine from the bottle belonging to the table next to us. I wouldn't have found it strange if it was right when she opened it, but it was towards the end of their meal when they were close to finishing the bottle.I ordered a glass of prosecco while clearly reading from the restaurant week wine list but must have forgotten to say rose, because I was given and charged for a different, more expensive glass that was not on the restaurant week wine list. No big deal, especially since it was only a $3 difference, but it would have been nice for her to clarify what I was ordering if she wasn't sure.I ordered the clam chowder, ahi tuna and the chocolate cake, while my friend ordered the tuna tartare, salmon and cherry upside down cake. We tasted eachother's dishes and I was very happy with my selections, as was she. I had really been looking foward to the clam chowder as I had read quite a few positive reviews about it. It wasn't as great as I had expected but tt definitely wasn't bad. I would have preferred it to have more small pieces of clams versus the couple of large (too large) pieces it came with. That definitely would have helped balance the potato to clam ratio since most spoonfuls were all potato, no clam. The ahi tuna was definitely the winning dish, and I loved the soba noodles it came with! One of the more disappointing aspects of our meal was the dessert. I ordered the chocolate cake (which was really rich and delicious) because it came with salty caramel ice cream (my favorite!!) but was disappointed when there was absolutely no salty flavor to it!

All were phenomenal. Both seafood dishes were fresh, and each seasoned minimally letting the natural flavors come through. The ice cream was, dare I say... cute. Next time I might order something a little more fit for an adult, but it was still very good. The only reason Lure won't get five stars is because of our service. Our waiter was generally absent, while our busser ended up being more attentive and engaging. Maybe I can contribute the missing service to restaurant week, but for Lure, our lunch was generally not much less than what the average patron would spend on lunch there, so I would expect the service to match. Regardless of the service this time, I plan on returning to Lure for their great food and atmosphere.",0,0,0,Joe G.,"ASTORIA, NY",17,32,6

One of my favorite neighborhoods in the city, and Lure is located right underneath Prada. I think this has to be one of top favorites places still up to today, and I have been living here for a few years now. You cant beat the location, and I'm such a downtown guy, so I find any excuse to be around this area. I love the decor, as it's built like a yacht inside. I highly recommend their calamari, oysters, ahi tuna, sushi, etc. It's a great seafood and fish bar, very fresh seafood, awesome drinks, and I just love the vibe. I think on weekends, it almost turns into like a lounge by the bar. It's such a fun scene, the crowd is great! Good looking crowd!

It is a bit loud as the tables are situated probably closer together than they should be for this type of restaurant. Service is good. Efficient and friendly w/o being overbearing. For appetizers we ordered the special which were lobster sliders. They were OK, the bun was the best part about it, the lobster salad itself inside was not amazing. We ordered the fluke ceviche which I liked a lot. It wasn't as tart as your peruvian ceviche, made with grapes it was sweet and refreshing. The jalapeno yellowtail roll was also good. The entree we ordered came split on two dishes which was nice. They had a scallop special which they should add to their menu because it was delicious! Overall really nice experience.

With the yacht-like decor and the 80s music it felt like we were on a booze cruise. This place is very trendy and loud, you have to scream to hear people at your table. There seemed to be a curtained area for quieter dining, and I would request that area if you want to have a conversation during dinner. That said, the waitresses were very friendly, the servers very attentive, and the food was good and the seafood very fresh. The dishes we ordered were the surf and turf, stuffed halibut, steamed red snapper and the daily special of blackened sea bass. Although all were tasty, the stuffed halibut was my favorite by far. Truly memorable. Had the calamari and fried oysters for appetizers (they were good but nothing to write home about), my brother had the clam chowder which was watery and tasted more like butter than traditional chowder, and the molten chocolate cake and cookie plate were also good but nothing special.

You feel like you're inside of a cruise boat, and they have those great semi-circular booths that make you feel all fancy. The food is also excellent. I got the crab-stuffed halibut with asparagus, and I enjoyed every bite. We also got the ceviche and the lobster croutons for appetizers, both of which were very good. My friends got some raw bar options, and my boyfriend got the steak, all of which was good.I have to take one star off for REALLY slow service, and I have to take one star off for small portions for the price.

We then ordered a bunch of sushi and sashimi, all of which was absolutely delicious and a fresh as you would ask for. My problem with this restaurant obviously wasn't the food, but the service. The place was SO dark that I was hardly able to see the faces of the people that I was with, and our waiter disappeared halfway through our meal to wait on other tables.

4.0,5/10/2011,"Gold-diggers don't get a day off. That's a fact. However, it must be something like the equivalent of a Casual Friday for them at Lure Fishbar, because while they are certainly in attendance, they are also a bit more inconspicuous about it all. The cougar sub-species is scattered across dining tables and not exclusively perched at the bar, per their usual. The young, twenty-somethings' silicone sweater puppies are a bit more covered up with cardigans draped over spaghetti straps. And the stick-thin models only pull out their cigarettes between two fingers after dessert, as opposed to taunting the smoke alarms during the entirety of their meal.These girls can't fool me. But they may be onto something. Lure Fishbar is home to some of the most unique interior design in the city - a near-perfect replica of a high-end ocean liner serving as the belly of the restaurant. Being subterranean surely works in the establishment motif's favor as the street level acts as some faux-water line, complete with circular cabin windows out of which patrons can peer.However, do not mistake Lure Fishbar as some one-trick pony. Yes, the decor is impressive. Yes, the clientele can be new-money, upper-crust New York. Yes, the pop music playlist always sounds like it's only a few songs away from droppin' club beats. But, thankfully, their food just also happens to be delicious.Where to begin? The Crab Cakes, while creatively speaking, a bit cliche, are some of the best I've ever had. Served hot and ready to go, with a slightly crisp exterior and bursting with amazing flavor (especially when dipped in the Old Bay aioli), this is one appetizer that is a must-try for any seafood lover.If you're feeling adventurous, look no further than the Fluke Ceviche. You heard me. Fluke Ceviche. Clean cuts of fish and a seriously refreshing combination of red grapes, chili, olives, and elderflower make this the perfect sharing plate, served with a set of strictly-functional, otherwise-underwhelming tortilla chips to shovel this baby home.Keep going? OK. Let's talk about the Grilled Octopus Salad. Now, most grilled octopi are smoky, tough, and delicious enough to be one of those buzzwords on menus that I will almost always automatically gravitate towards. But Lure's grilled octopus is quite the enigma - soft mollusk morsels that melt in your mouth. How can this be? Turns out the kitchen soaks these suckers before putting them on the grill and that makes all the difference. Other seafood chefs, take note - this is some simple, yet tremendous culinary execution.Finally, a question - can seafood ever be considered rustic? Is there such a thing? Seems like more of a land-locked state type of term, and not for some coastal catch. However, if this descriptor is at all applicable, my special was rustic indeed - a Pan Seared Halibut (with Roasted Potatoes and Scallions). If any of the fish entrees on their regular menu are as good as this one, you really can't go wrong here.Treat yourself by washing it all down with a SoHo Moon cocktail (moonshine whiskey, ginger elderflower, and lime juice). Try to imagine a Pimm's Cup drinking herself stupid, and as a result, taking that rugged whiskey down at the end of the bar home for a good time after last call. Well, the SoHo Moon is the ""Gift from God"" spawned from this one-night-stand-turned-shotgun-wedding.So, what's the catch with this place? Well, while our waitress was fantastic, the pacing of our dining experience was a little mismanaged as there was way too much lag time between courses. And, while I hate to call it out, the hostess was a bit rude. For some, the relatively small portion sizes might not warrant their price tags. As for me, Lure Fishbar is the closest thing I've come to being on a real cruise ship, and for the gastronomic voyage I embarked upon here, I gotta say, I got my money's worth.",5,0,4,Dan R.,"Brooklyn, NY",633,551,148

4.0,5/8/2011,"I came here for dinner a couple of weeks ago, and I left fairly impressed with the quality of the food and service offered here. This subterranean restaurant has a modern, trendy interior, and the dim lighting adds to the atmosphere. For the table, we started with the large Shellfish Plateau, which came with 12 oysters, eight shrimp, eight clams, 10 crab claws, seafood salad, and one pound of lobster. Served as a two-tiered platter, the seafood was fresh and tasty, though some of the crab claws and clams were on the small side. For my entrée, I ordered one of that evening's specials - Pan-Seared Striped Bass with Shrimp Polenta and Tomatillo Sauce. The bass was absolutely delicious, with the buttery and flaky fish pairing nicely with the refreshing tomatillo sauce and sweet peppers. The shrimp polenta on which the fish rested was sufficiently creamy and tasty, but it felt a bit mismatched with the bass. Small quibbles, to be sure, given that everything on my plate tasted great. Most of the rest of the table also opted for the bass, but someone else ordered the Rock Shrimp Risotto, which featured grains of rice which were chewy and still very toothsome. The person who ordered the dish proclaimed it to be tasty nonetheless, but that's not how risotto is supposed to be.Overall, I enjoyed my meal at Lure Fishbar.

While the devil's eggs are bite size, the american cavier inside is delicious and above average grade. As far as alcohol, try the ginger apple martini. Very generous amount of vodka with a subtle taste of ginger. Delightful. The dinner is somewhat on the pricey side. I sat down for dinner only one time. Considering the cost of their entrees, I am somewhat disappointed by the quality of their food. But two thumbs up for their happy hours special!",1,0,0,Raymond N.,"Oakland Gardens, NY",117,94,4

I've decided I like anything fried. (I've even had fried pickles!) Anyways, the fish was so warm and so soft. You can't even taste the frying oil that much. It didn't taste greasy at all. Dessert - I got the warm chocolate cake with caramel ice cream and popcorn that I later traded my friend for his apple bread pudding with ice cream and rum raisin sauce. The chocolate cake was alright, but he seemed to really like it. The bread pudding - SO SO GOOD. He said he tasted too much alcohol but you really can't!

Great fish restaurants I believe are tested by simple preparations of fish, without sauces as those tend to be the most challenging and Lure was spot on.

Me and my dining partner were seated quickly, and we proceeded to order. We were just planning to grab something quick to fill ourselves before we got our shop on. This was around 4 in the afternoon. We split a salad, a fish dish, and some sashimi to share. The salad and the fish was quite good, delicate and delicious. However the sashimi, well I can't really comment on it because this is where our experience turned sour. We never received our sashimi, instead we got sushi. When I brought this to the waiter's attention, the waiter insisted that I had ordered sushi instead of sashimi. It wasn't possible because as we ordered we actually discussed whether to have sushi or sashimi while the waiter was taking our order and I remember specifically ordering sashimi because sushi would be too filling. I was so put off by the gesture of the waiter not willing to admit a mistake, and a minor mistake at that. We didn't want to argue so we just ate the sushi. It made the rest of the meal difficult to enjoy.At the end of the day, if this was a regular diner or even a neighborhood restaurant I would've been fine.

By the time I left it was packed and popping. The food was very good too. I had half a dozen oysters (blue point, beau soleil and kumamoto) and and half a dozen littlenecks clams.

Creamy horseradish went so well on top of salmon tartare - who would have thought? For main course I had Baked Cod (mushroom ragout, scallion potatoes, miso sauce). It looked impressive and tasted very good - so many different ingredients but went so well together.

Our waitress disappeared for lengthy periods of time. Also, when we would order more drinks (as another reviewer indicated they push quite heavily), she would appear sometimes with one drink at a time making it awkward for ""toasting"" etc. The food ... the food I have to say was flavorful in some respects. The cod entree is excellent and the lobster croutons are quite original. However, there is still some bland ... I love octopus and was excited for the octopus salad but it seemed kind of ""eh"". I think more than anything I felt that the service hurt my experience. The waitress seemed disinterested and sadly I must say that the hostesses seemed in no rush to get you to your table and wanted you to live mostly at the bar. It is definitely a ""scene"" which doesn't always mean it isn't good, but it is one of those sad occurrences where the scene has become more important than the food.

3.0,2/9/2011,"Went here for dinner yesterday night, and it was...alright. My date picked a rhone valley white wine, which was really excellent. We had the octopus salad and the fluke ceviche. The octopus in the salad was fresh and had the exact consistency of chicken. All in all, it was kind of an unremarkable dish. There were hazelnuts dotted about the plate, which was basically the strongest flavor of the dish since the octopus and whatever dressing they used were really mild. The ceviche was disappointing mild, too. It was kind of sweet, with grapes and olives mixed in. I appreciated the plantain chips they supplied to dip with, however. We also got 2 dozen oysters from PEI and they were sublime. For an entree, we split a seared tuna dish on a bed of peanut soba noodles. The kitchen actually split the entree onto two separate plates, which was really accommodating of them. The tuna was excellent in taste and quality. However, the noodles underneath were warm, not cold. Not only did this make the tuna a little less rare, it was a weird culinary choice and seemed like an obvious mistake. Regardless, the flavors were good and it was a satisfying dish. The atmosphere and service are top-notch, but I'd have to admit that there are other restaurants out there that'd provide more flavor and skill for your buck. The wine and the oysters were the definite highlights of the meal. I want to like Lure for dinner, but I'd have to say that it might be best reserved for brunch. Get. That. French.

2.0,2/2/2011,"This review is based on experiences on two separate occasions.Experience #1: I first visited Lure Fishbar during Winter 2010 RW lunch with 4 friends. Service was horrendously slow, even though the dining room wasn't even very packed. I also sensed that staff didn't treat us with the same respect or attention that older-looking patrons received. The food was tasty from what I remember; I had the rock shrimp tempura appetizer and steamed branzino with jasmine rice in a fragrant jus. Don't remember what I had for dessert... so I guess that item wasn't all that memorable.Experience #2: Returned over the spring for Sunday brunch (only because nearby Hundred Acres and Jane were both too crowded). First off, the hostess seemed somewhat annoyed and standoffish when I told her I didn't have a reservation (even though the dining room was not even 1/3 full!). She sat us anyway, so clearly the place wasn't booked, so I thought the attitude was unnecessary. The service only got worse. After we sat down, it took at least 5 minutes for anyone to notice that we didn't have any water or anything else to drink. Then after bf and I examined their menu, it took over 10 minutes for anyone to notice that we have yet to order or even greeted. It wasn't until the floor manager noticed the displeasure written on my face that he personally took our orders himself. I'm sorry but by that point it is already too late.The brunch menu was pretty generic and boring, consisting of normal brunch staples without any real twists. I ordered the banana walnut pancakes while bf ordered the short rib hash. Let me correct myself, I THOUGHT I ordered the banana walnut pancakes, but after eating more than half the dish did I realize that what came out of the kitchen were just ordinary buttermilk pancakes. I should have realized the discrepancy right off the bat, as there were no banana or walnut garnish on top of the short stack... but I was hopeful that there would be some tiny traces inside the batter. Clearly I was very wrong. Bf said the short rib hash (a tiny portion) was underseasoned, and the spinach to meat ratio was wayyyyy off. I assumed that he was pretty unimpressed as well, but at least he actually received what he intended to order.Overall I think Lure Fishbar has fresh seafood and good things on its menu, but the service and overall dining experiences I have had here bring even the food down so much that I don't think I will ever be coming back.",1,0,1,Cecilia Z.,"Los Angeles, CA",762,644,43

We were seated pretty promptly but squeezed in - tight spaces, eesh. The grandpa next to us was watching, staring, and commenting on our food and table side manner all night to his companion - really annoying. Not that we were eating like heathens or anything. Just random weird comments. Sigh.Anyways - to the good stuff. No bread! Boo. Yeah yeah, I know it's not an Italian restaurant, it's a seafood restaurant, but still. NYC spoils me. RW menu: tempura shrimp to start, which was pretty good, decent size for an appetizer. I opted for the yellowfish tuna medium-rare, but realized after I should have gotten it rare.  It's probably my own palette, but it just didn't taste good to have the tougher cooked tuna enveloping the really good uncooked tuna in the middle. They're two totally different consistencies and took away from the overall enjoyment of the dish. The peanut sauced soba was good, but didn't really mesh well with the tuna either - sauce was a little too overwhelming in my opinion. The salmon was much better, even though it wasn't the best I've had.  Tender, well-cooked and well-seasoned. I was lukewarm with the meal until... UNTIL... the dessert. I die. It was apple bread pudding soaked in the caramelly rum sauce. The edges were that crispy crumbly deliciousness, and every bite was like heaven. If you've ever watched West Side Story, we were like Tony and Maria on the dancefloor - just the bread pudding and me.  The chocolate cake wasn't bad either.Fantastic server, horrid service otherwise from the staff that brought out the plates and cleared the table. Quite a few times, things were dropped in front of us with a clang without a word, and plates were taken away without a word as well, not even to check if we were finished.  Mixed bag, seriously.

Appetizer: Raw Bar Tasting: The best part of the meal, which is kinda sad considering you can't really mess this up. Entree: Seared Yellowfin Tuna: Ordered medium rare, which came out fine. I felt that the fish was overpowered by the soba noodles and thai peanut sauce. I would've liked it with a less powerful, less dense kind of sauce. My friend had the Branzino, which I liked more than the tuna (although he thought it was mediocre). The sauce was delicate and perfectly complemented the fish. Dessert: Warm Chocolate Cake: Basically just a molten chocolate cake, which I must say was well-made. Also sided with a salted caramel ice cream, which was good except small in portion, so that the cold and hot were not balanced and at the end you are left with dry cake.

3.0,1/29/2011,"Came for Restaurant Week dinner, ordering the $35 prix fix (and trying most of it with my group) along with several other items off the regular menu.  Lure Fishbar is located in the middle of Soho, a large subterranean space that seems completely hidden from the street level.  The decor has plenty of nautically-themed touches, but tastefully done and not gimmicky.  The restaurant is gently separated into different dining areas; the ones I saw included the bar, main dining area, oyster bar, sushi bar, and a smaller dining room.  Ambience is casual and comfortable. The black-clad waitstaff were ubiquitous and constantly on the move, got the job done, although our waitress was sometimes hard to find.The seafood-centric menu is divided into selections from the raw bar or sushi bar, seafood appetizers, entrees, and soup or salads, and a meat section.  They have a wine list, cocktail menu, and a small bottled beer list.  The Restaurant Week menu seemed a good cross-section of their offerings, and we ordered most of the items on the menu between the three in my party.  In addition, we also ordered oysters, shrimp cocktail, and two specialty sushi rolls.From the raw bar, the oysters were very good but the shrimp cocktail was mediocre, slightly overcooked, and doesn't seem worth the price.  Among appetizers, the clam chowder was good, different than I expected because the bacon was a stronger flavor than I'm used to; tuna tartare was good, no surprises; shrimp tempura was hot, crisp, flavorful, and better than the cocktail.  For entrees, the perfectly grilled salmon was deliciously paired with a refreshing corn and pepper relish; the branzino was fresh and well-cooked, served simply with a little white rice, bit of mushrooms and scallions, and soy sauce, although I'd prefer the skin being crispy instead of steamed; and the sushi sampler was pretty good for my friend, but not edible for me because my standards for sushi is too high.  The portions for all were fairly generous for a prix fix menu.  The dragon roll and yellowtail jalapeno rolls were decent but not something I'd get again.  For dessert, the warm chocolate cake with salted caramel ice cream was blissfully chocolately, not very sweet; apple bread pudding was also good, cinnamon ice cream didn't taste like anything; ice cream sandwiches were interesting but I didn't find them otherwise memorable.The verdict is mixed, so I tend to think the rest of the menu may be a mix of hits and misses, but I think its a good place for seafood.  I would avoid the sushi bar and shrimp cocktail but would love to try other seafood I didn't eat this visit.",0,0,0,Valery C.,"Forest Hills, NY",56,837,9616

But I'd definitely come back for a drink sometime just because the space is so cool. Maybe I'd try the sushi bar.",0,2,0,Alex M.,"New York, NY",4,97,0

4.0,1/28/2011,"Brian picked this place for restaurant week so we had dinner here last night - SUCH A GOOD CALL!SETTING:I love the nautical décor here. it feels like the interior of a boat! dim lighting, round windowpanes, double doors, the works. & the restaurant is below street level. the vibe is perfect for après work drinks, but also good for dinner for two. there are a couple of private rooms for bigger parties as well.FOOD:RAW BAR TASTING - eat + west coast oysters & shrimp cocktail. fresh & perfect.TUNA TARTARE - I love this dish - you can taste the hint of sesame but it has a Mexican flair with the small strips of tortilla & dollop of guac on top. love!SUSHI PLATE - came with a spicy big eye tuna roll & 8 pieces of sushi. everything is super fresh!STEAMED BRANZINO - amazing. a big half of it, with the skin on & sitting on this ponzu sauce with jasmine rice. very refreshing since I've been eating VERY rich & savory meals lately.CHOCOLATE CAKE - this was really good, the salted caramel ice cream is sitting on top of caramel popped corn =)ICE CREAM COOKIE SANDWICHES - Brian loved this, it's two ice cream sandwiches, cut in half. one had strawberry ice cream in between two shortbreads & another had vanilla + choc chips in between shortbread cookies as well.DRINKS:STRAWBERRY BASIL MARTINI - omg amazing! pretty strong though but perfect for sipping. just a teeny hint of basil - so good!SAKE MARTINI - this is refreshing - I love the hint of cucumber. as the bartender was shaking this, you could smell the cukes. really good. get this is if you just want a nice drink but nothing too sweet.BELLINI MARTINI - this was ok. I think that my palate got too used to the sweet strawberry martini that when I finally got this, it tasted a bit too tart.SPIKE ARNOLD PALMER - ok by this time, I had a really good buzz so I'm probably not the best judge when I say it was ok. the first two drinks are definitely better.SERVICE:I absolutely love the staff here. they left us alone & did not rush us at all. every course came in at a very good pace.PRICE:everything came out to around $150 with tip. it's not bad considering the fact that we ordered about a bajillion drinks. which is how they hook you during restaurant week anyway.

The dining room was slightly less crowded.  Our table received neither bread nor amuse bouches referred to in other reviews. The best part of the my restaurant week  meal was probably the tempura shrimp with black sesame seeds and spicy mayo. The shrimp were plump, piping hot, and well battered.  For entree, I tried the steamed branzino with oyster mushrooms, jasmine rice, ponzu, which was very light and could have used a more substantial amount of vegetables on the side. Of all the entrees at my table, only the seared tuna looked like a good portion.  For dessert, I chose the cute ice cream sandwiches (vanilla chocolate chip and strawberry with shortbread dipped in dark chocolate).  The warm chocolate cake with caramel ice cream looked good too.

4.0,1/14/2011,"I can only speak for the Happy Hour [5-7pm] & my experience from sitting at the bar.  I made plans to meet a friend there last night, Thursday & it was packed when I walked in around 6:45pm. All the lounge seats were taken & no space at the bar.  But a very nice gentlemen offered me his seat & kept me company until my friend showed up.The comfortable bar & lounge area started to empty out around 7:30 & then got really busy again around 9pm? I think? We ended up staying until almost midnight!  If you are looking for a quiet place, this isn't it.  The music is fun [lots of 80's last night] but you can barely hear it over all the conversations.  I don't think the dining room [which could use some updating, is like the inside of a tastefully decorated 70's-ish large yacht] started to empty out until after 11:30pm so the atmosphere was definitely buzzy.  With a mostly late 20's-30 something-ish crowd.  Conservative banker looking types with a few fashionistas mixed in.  But the place definitely did not have a pretentious vibe at all.The drinks were delicious & the reason we stayed much later than expected.  The bartenders were also pretty good at handling the very busy bar & never threw an attitude.  But were actually somewhat attentive & helpful. Had the grapefruit margarita, ginger apple martini, & the pomegranate margarita.  The chicken lollipops were ok. The lobster croutons were a mistake to order. The $9 dish was literally 4 crouton pieces with a bit of lobster on them. For some reason I was imagining a bruschetta with lobster on top.  The Happy Hour oysters which were blue points, were great & $1.50 each.  The calamari looked good, I wasn't fast enough to taste it.  It wasn't heavily breaded so I'd probably like them  & they were spicy.  I couldn't resist trying a dessert & got the pumpkin cheesecake served with vanilla ice cream & anglaise sauce.  It was opposite of a dense heavy cheesecake that I was expecting.  It was light with just a touch of pumpkin flavor & went down too easily.  Our bill for 2 people with all the food I mentioned plus about 7-8 drinks [with only 2 of them at HH prices] was around $150.  I'll have to go back & actually eat dinner next time as opposed to drinking it.",0,0,0,J A.,"New York, NY",0,3,0

I loved the music they played from early Michael Jackson to Musical Youth (""Pass the Dutchie"" --- if you don't know). The price was also a little too high for my taste. Mongo said it was it was due to their location.  I responded in kind by telling him that their location didn't make their food taste better. Mostly, I didn't appreciate the inconsiderate sushi chef and his assistant making comments about me taking pictures.... saying that it seemed like I had never seen food before. Pardon me, but perhaps I'm a photographer that enjoys taking photos of my surroundings.

4.0,1/2/2011,"A fishbar?? Chicka whaaaaaaat?? Yup, that was my reaction when my friend suggested we go to a cool place that had an awesome lobster roll. Ummm.....kay! And off we went. We were at Lure on a Thursday night around 8:00, we walk in, and the woman immediately asked if we wanted to check our coats and bags and, seeing as I went to town at AllSaints earlier, yes please take my crap. Did we have reservations? Nope! But they seated us anyways. This place is definitely really cool when it comes to decor. It did feel like we were inside of a yacht and I absolutely loved how dim it was. Lure is a great place to take a date, spouse, whoever if you want to get a little buzzed and impress the person your with (and get laid later in the night). We both ordered cocktails. I can't remember what they were called but mine was a blueberry something or other and my friend ordered an orange...something or other. They were both VERY good and definitely had a nice kick to it. Not that bad in price either, about $13 a drink, but they were good drinks. Ok, when it comes to new places, I'm always so lazy to look over a new menu and order something I recognize. Thaaaaaaat's right, folks! This yelper went to a fishbar and ordered a burger and fries....I know I know. But my friend ordered the lobster roll she was craving all day. We also ordered the fried calamari for appetizers. The calamari was very delicious...I just wish my friend or the waitress had told me that the sauce they pour all over it was spicy....it would have saved me some horrible ulcer pain, but it was very good so, forgiven! My burger was alright, the waitress definitely hyped it up saying it's one of the best sellers in the restaurant. Yea.....no it's not, don't lie. It's was a small burger smothered in red onions and kind of gross onion rings. Oh and also smothered with lettuce. Hey, Lady! Where's the beef? Oh wait, there it is, I couldn't see it with all the unnecessary crap on my burger. My friend was literally having an orgasm in her mouth as she chowed down her lobster roll (wow, orgasm and roll in the same sentence when reviewing a restaurant, gota love it!). Her dish was definitely very good. I had a few, OK, a lot of bites from her dish. But it was only fair since she downed my fries, the only ""good"" part of my dish. Besides my burger that definitely was not worth $17.00, this place is definitely worth the price! The lobster roll was $29.95 and the calamari was $15ish. I mean, honestly, Lure was definitely out of my price range (my cut of the bill was $61....ugh!) but I just loved the decor and the dim lighting and the drinks and my friend's dish. Good stuff. Our waitress was also very nice (well, just don't ask her for suggestions, she's wrong). Also, we stayed there about and hour and a half and the lighting gradually became dimmer and dimmer, when it was time to leave, I was dead tired and wanted to sleep on the table, low lighting=sleepiness!

2.0,12/5/2010,"So, I went to Lure Fishbar last night.  I had high hopes for it because it was the winner of the Time Out New York Best New Seafood Restaurant and I'm a definite seafood lover.  Sadly, my guest and I came away grossly disappointed.It started off negative right from the get-go.  When I approached the hostess to confirm my reservation, she immediately turned to the Maitre D who sternly told us to ""wait over there.""  After waiting about 10 minutes, two girls then arrived, hugged and schmoozed with the Maitre D, then were seated at a luxurious booth in the back; whereas my guest and I were stuck at a crummy table near the front door and by the coat check crowd.There were some major issues with the overall atmosphere.  One of the first things I noticed was the noise level. The acoustics in this place was horrendous and was reminiscent of a middle school cafeteria.  The blasting Top 40 music didn't help matters.  Not only was it hard to hear your tablemates, but it was also hard to see them.  The lighting wasn't mood lighting but rather dim lighting.  Finally, I was upset with our seating but realized there weren't many good seats in this place to begin with.  It's organized like a long train car and either you're too close to the door, too close to the bus boy station, too close to the bar, or too close to the kitchen.  Just to give you the heads-up if you have a ""too close to the door"" spot, don't check your coat because it gets drafty.Overall, the service was poor.  The Maitre D started things off on the wrong note and the busboy neglected us throughout the meal (with the exception of offering us to refill our glasses of water when we were paying the bill).  There was one highlight to this experience:  the food!  I had the steamed branzino and my companion had the steamed red snapper.  Both had very unique sauces and our dishes were served very shortly after ordering.  It would've been nice to be offered bread before our entrees, though.  Usually, we like to lounge and drink wine at a leisurely pace after our meal, but we felt so stifled after this experience, we left abruptly after finishing our meal.Overall, the food is excellent but with some gaping holes in the service and ambiance, it just wasn't worth it.",0,0,0,Lisa R.,"Mahwah, NJ",23,122,10

It's a dark lit setting, ideal for romantic dates (albeit it's a bit loud so prepare to speak up!) or casual friendly get-togethers.My girlfriend and I shared the grilled octopus salad, which was a beautiful concoction of peppery arugula (a few leaves at best! why such small portions? more greenery would definitely not detract from the dish!), a few chunks of celery, acidified cherry tomatoes with the integrity of their skins broken down to a mushier texture, small toasted hazelnuts (amazing touch), and featured circular pieces of coin-sized grilled octopus with a chewy but not overly so consistency and marinated with a salty sauce. A few bites of warm goodness for a short few minutes. Portions really should be increased for a $17 dish.My friend doesn't eat raw seafood, and so oysters and sushi/sashimi weren't on the list of options. (I note this because I would've gone for the oyster sampler.) Her entree was the baked cod marinated in miso, which came with green mashed potatoes (scallion infused according to the menu) and bits of mushroom. I had a bite of her fish, which tasted as you'd expect baked cod to taste anywhere else. My friend noted that the dish was a bit too salty.The waitress recommended the grilled whole daurade, steamed branzino, roasted sea scallops, or classic lobster roll, of which I chose the steamed branzino. The fish had the texture, moisture, and softness of steamed snapper fish that you would typically order at a Chinese restaurant. ""Chinese"" as the fish might seem, it came with a flavorful, clear broth. In between the two halves of branzino was a spread of finely chopped cilantro that freshened up the entire dish. To the side was a small portion of rice which soaked up the clear broth, lending it a burst of flavor. Atop the fish were little pieces of oyster mushrooms and scallions. My only request would be to serve the fish hot, not warm.The bellini was delicious, but the lychee martini didn't taste like lychee.

I went with my permanent date :) but its perfect for a first or second, or just a night out with the ladies. The tables for 2 have quite some space in between them, and the music is a bit loud, so its a little hard to hear each other.I'm not a huge fan of oysters, but I went for the 1/2 chilled lobster and it was delicious. We also got the warmed grilled octopus salad... good, but very small serving. I got the tuna, served with a spicy peanut sauce, mushrooms, scallions, leeks (I think?) & soba noodles. They serve in little slices, which was unexpected but it was sooooo good. One of the best tuna plates I've had. My boyfriend got the Brandzino(?), he wanted to try a new fish... I didn't like it too much but he did.Nice selection of cocktails, I went for their pale ale from Nantucket for something new.The tuna dish totally won me over.

From 5-7p they have a set happy hour menu in the bar area but seating fills up very quickly. Yes they are snotty about you leaving the tables by 7, claiming they are reserved, but who cares, you can get your happy hour fix in before then anyway. As you can imagine,  it's difficult to try and eat a dozen raw  Naked Cowboy LI oysters while drinking a dark and stormy without a seat. The menu is pretty ridiculous on pricing, so I've kept all my visits here short but sweet. Maybe if I get a raise I can spring for the $30 lobster roll! All jokes aside, best oysters I've had in Manhattan have been here & Aquagrill. Usually bluepoints or naked cowboys for happy hour, but the shimp tempura and chicken lollipops are also delicious. All drinks are delicious that I have tried, haven't gotten to the bellini yet but I'm sure it's good too.

Then for entree I had the tuna caponata, rare (wonderfully cooked). My fiancé had the Bronzino which tasted great, but we found several small bones in the filet... Very disapointing. The atmosphere was a mix of a nice dark lit room, romantic ad nice.... With Britney spears blasting in the background :( we didn't get how the bilboard top 20 enhanced the atmospere.

The decor is perfect, you feel like you're sitting in a big boat, and there's plenty of room for a lot of people.

Both times were for after dinner drinks and desert.  I really enjoyed both of the times that I've been here.  The staff was extremely helpful and friendly.  It did help out a lot that my date happens to be a regular at Lure and maybe we did get a little bit more attention than you would as a first timer.  With that being said, I did notice that the staff was very pleasant and friendly to everyone around us.  Generally I find that establishments down in Soho are quite snobbish but I didn't get that vibe at all here. One of the great things that I noticed about the staff was that there were a lot of smiles even running to and from the kitchen.  That really added to the comfort and ease of the place.As far as drinks go, prices are pretty standard for a place of this reputation and location, but the quality is great.  My date ordered us an off the menu specialty of one of the bartenders, a lychee saketini, damn was it good!  Perfect for a hot NYC summer night, her mix of the ingredients were genus, the sweetness of the fresh lychee was a perfect balance with the dryness of the sake she used.  All the bartenders here really know what they are talking about when it comes to libations, tell them what you are in the mood for and they will find a cocktail, wine or liqueur to satisfy. We really didn't order any of the food but what the people around us were nibbling on all smelled and looked scrumptious.  My date promised that when it was his turn to take me out that he would take me here for dinner, I'm holding him to that promise.   We did however order Lure's signature desert, home made ice cream sandwiches...seriously delish!!!  The peanut butter ice cream between 2 chocolate chip cookies was heaven, the mint chocolate chip & chocolate cookie sandwich was a time machine to my childhood.  Do not skip this desert if you go.Based on the bar alone, I am eagerly anticipating dinner here.  I'll update this review when that happens.",0,0,0,John T.,"Maplewood, NJ",90,58,6

3.0,7/10/2010,"I almost expected to hand in a boarding pass while making my way to our table at Lure Fishbar. For the decor is that of a cruise ship...without the surfing, massive buffets, captain's night and other traits that make modern cruising what it is.No, instead Lure's cruise motif harkens back to an earlier ear of nautical relaxation, one aesthetically pleasing and more sophisticated than the current fleet.It's quite a spacious layout, with a huge bar serving up happy hour specials until 7pm (like clockwork the bar emptied out around then), a raw bar in the back, booths and tables tastefully spaced in the main cabin. Candles abounded, even in the men's room!So far, quite alluring but what of the nibbles? 20,000 leagues under the sea of goodness or residue from Davy Jones' Locker ?I place the cuisine somewhere in between those extremes. As an appetizer, I started out with a salmon tartar, that when presented, actually reminded me of a flan. A few pieces of melba toast were present for coating with the salmon and the round dome of tartar was topped with roe. I enjoyed this appetizer as it was the right combination of size and taste. Most appetizers are in the $14 range, with my wife's soft-shell crab coming in at the same. That appetizer consisted of one solitary soft-shell crab-- we almost felt sorry for it.My main was a grilled whole daurade, a popular Mediterranean fish,  served with dill gnocchi and tomato. I could count the gnocchi on one hand. Delicious yes, but sparse.My daurade was delicious fish, filled with white meat sacrificed to my belly that melted in my mouth. The chunks of tomato were slightly distracting but a fresh lemon wedge was welcome for squeezing atop the firm, white flesh.Branzino, snapper and halibut were other fishy options for the entree. I should mention that there is also a respectable sushi and sashimi menu and a very large wine menu. Cocktails are also offered and my spiked Arnold Palmer was on the mild side with a bit more ice than I'm accustomed too. Service was friendly and Lure gets a tip of the hat for working with my nearly last minute reservation shift to a later time.Dessert was a tasty peanut butter cake, presented on the plate with a chocolate covered pretzel stick and small scoop of peanut butter ice cream. We thoroughly enjoyed this part of the meal and I'd say this was the highlight for sheer taste alone-- I really can't find any flaw in this dessert.Final cost for 2, with appetizers, drinks , entrees and one dessert-- the mid $120's. A bit steep for what we received, portion-wise but the setting and service did compensate. I'd consider booking another cruise for happy hour.",1,0,1,Tom K.,"Forest Hills, NY",337,820,47

It was kind of like asian fish.Again AMAZING. The rice on the side.. wow. I eat rice everyday and I never had rice quite like this before. Pairing it with the fish grazed with slightly sweet soy sauce, it was heaven in your mouth. I couldn't get enough of it. I also had a bite of the salmon entree from my friend's plate and it too was lovely.For the desserts, i had the three flavor sorbets. It was good. nothing too special.

3.0,6/4/2010,"Usually restaurants with a theme fail to be charming.  Lure Fishbar is a clear exception to that rule.  The restaurant is designed like a cruise ship.  It is located below ground in SoHo with nice circular windows opening out to the street, much like cabin windows peering just over the water line.  Inside the flourishes of wood and plentiful handrails completes the effect.  It's not excessive, so it errors towards being stately.  It is perfect in setting the mood for a seafood dinner.  I began with the New England clam chowder ($12) -- a pricey selection that ultimately was disappointing.  The littleneck clams were few and far between, and, sadly, some sand was present.  Far more abundant were the potatoes which was a disservice given the price.  Oddly, the potatoes seemed undercooked giving them a sharp texture.  The soup itself was not particularly creamy, but that is ultimately a stylistic preference.  Okay overall, but I would not seek it out again.  For the main course, I opted for the grilled whole daurade ($29).  Grilled whole fish!  How refreshing.  It was served with herbs de provence, agro dolce, tomatoes, and a side of dill gnocchi.  The fish was nice, but not much flavor was imparted to it from the herbs.  Having a grilled lemon to squeeze over the body of the fish was a very nice touch though.  Nuanced acidity.  The gnocchi were fairly good though, not being heavy and adding a complementing taste.  Overall, a nice simple dish that was executed well.  The service was friendly but otherwise adequate.  While charming as a restaurant, I was not really taken by the quality of the seafood dishes in a way that I would be at Oceana for example.  They were fine but not memorable in any way.  3.5 stars",9,6,7,Jim U.,"Washington, DC",690,1303,3044

The waitress brought us things we didn't order and then charged us for them. The oysters were fresh but the sauces served with the oysters was average. The sushi was OK but not exceptional. Second, the ambiance is terrible (don't trust anyone who tells you differently). It's too loud with lots of echo from the hard wood walls. Does no one ever consider acoustics?

I think Lure has great food. the service is top notch just because my cousin is a usual here and has befriended the manager and waiters. We always get seated at a great table, even on busy nights. Right away went we are seated, we get warm dinner rolls with whipped butter and potato chips and edamame. Yum. I have tried the shrimp tampura. My goodness it's like Heaven in my mouth. I do feel as though it's not really shrimp tampura at all, but they can call it whatever they want since it tastes so good. The dipping sauce it comes with is so amazing. They also gave us tuna tartar which was very good. It was really sweet of them to let us try it. I have also tried the Lure House Salad which is amazing. On to the entrees. I have tried the salmon dish which was absolutely savory and very good. Grilled to perfection. And the scallops are delicious as well. Their seafood selection is amazing. I'm a huge fish person, I just stay away from the shellfish. So, that leads me to the oysters. I have never tried, but my cousin can consume a dozen of them. She claims it's the best raw oysters you can get. So I would go with her word on that. I have also tried the House Sushi Roll which is shrimp tampura with spicy tuna. It was okay. Nothing fantastic. I did not like the price tag on that dish. I felt like I could get better sushi some place else. Moving on to the desserts... The sorbets and ice cream are good, not good enough to pay whatever the price is. The chocolate cake is well worth the price, so if you're looking for some dessert, get that. So good. Satisfies your chocolate craving for days. Yum! I definitely recommend this place for seafood lovers and oyster lovers, but other than that I wouldn't come here.

Let's figure this one out.I came in today for lunch with my boyfriend. The Bloody Mary was just ok - so sad. I loved that they had Fat Tuesday specials on a Monday - because the specials were good. We had a dozen oysters. I love love love my Kumamoto oysters! Again, I had better ones at Cercle Rouge. Blue Water Grill and Giorgione beat them all when it comes to Kumamotos anyway. So the oysters were OK. The Fat Tuesday specials were a po boy and gumbo - both were good. I had a half portion of fish and chips and it was good. I am still searching for this very crispy and oh-so-soft inside fried fish that is not greasy - Lure's was a bit greasy, so was the po boy but the bread on the po boy was crispy and nice. We skipped dessert and left but I am definitely coming back for happy hour.The ambiance is great, the booths are very nice, our waiter had great personality. Get this, the girl bringing our drinks has them squeezed in between both hands, comes to the table and literally hands them out. I thought that was strange. Putting the fact that I'm a snob and a half aside, I'd think she'd set them on the table in front of us, not wait until we figure out she is trying to hand them over as if they were burning her hands. She has two hands, she was carrying two drinks, there were two of us at the table - no need to clump them together in both palms as if she had specials needs. Whatever. My sauvignon blanc was good. I should mention that. Until next time, Lure. Maybe even this week. And you better floor me with your happy hour specials. As much as I love Soho, it's so touristy and I just love my Tribeca so much more. Peace.",7,9,6,Bartholomew K.,"New York, NY",825,192,170
5.0,2/15/2010,"Came here for their happy hour special from 5-7pm. We ordered a few rounds of fresh clam and oyster on the shell for $1 each. Their little neck clam is soo fresh, and I definitely enjoyed clam more than their oysters. We also had oyster shooters which was filled with half shot full of bloody mary and Vodka. Another highlight of the night is their calamari!! It's sweet and crunchy. I must come back and eat more. Now let's talk about their drinks: Lure's happy hour include a few special cocktail options (besides wine) - Ginger apple martini, Bellini, and Margarita. My friend and I tried all of three, and I've gotta say, Lure is not stingy when it comes to alcohol! My favorite among all is the ginger apple martini.

3.0,2/10/2010,"I love Soho and I was expecting to find that this place was going to fit right in with the artsy, quality and hip vibe that is Soho. It's situated below street level on the corner of Prince and Mercer. We walked into a very dark and dimly lit good size restaurant. Definitely it was styled and decorated to mimic the dining room of a cruiseliner or yacht and for the first 5 minutes I was taking in the scene and looking around. It soon became a bit cheesy and overboard and just really gimmicky in a way that does not work.I would say, everything except the oysters were subpar. Service was slow and we were skipped over and ignored for the first 10-15mins of sitting down. It took that long after being seated to just get some water and bread. I was starving. I'd say the oysters were easily the best part of the meal. If you can make it for happy hour, where these fine pieces of sexiness could be had for $1 a piece, that would make things 100x better. I wanted to try what a $12 clam chowder tasted like and it definitely does not measure up to some of the best clam chowders I've had served up at some dumps of a restaurant elsewhere. I had the salmon, which tasted good for the first 3 bites and then the flavors became very overpowering and salty. Felt pretty bad that I dragged 3 other lovely people with me this time.",0,0,0,Yvette W.,"Brooklyn, NY",79,313,242

4.0,2/4/2010,"My g/f and I came for restaurant week, but when we left, Lure's happy hour special was the most memorable part of the night. Having heard about the happy hour from 5-7pm at Lure, we arrived at 6:45, barely making the cutoff, and the bar scene was abuzz. I'm a little skeptical about any $1 oyster deal but Lure proved its rep as a seafood place. We got 6 perfectly fresh and briny blue points for $6 on a bed of ice with all the fixins, and we accompanied these with $5 kirins and a $6 glass of white wine. If we had more time, we definitely would've dabbled in the other happy hour specials including the chicken lollipops (basically buffalo wings) which one party got 3 orders of! Also the bar wasn't a 4 sq foot area with 30 people sandwiched in. We comfortably sat at the long bar fit for about 15 people and there's also a small lounge area where maybe another 15-20 people sat.   We reluctantly extracted ourselves from the bar and went to the dining area for our restaurant week meal. I immediately appreciated that the RW menu featured apps and entrees that were on the regular menu but wow, the service was RW-like. Our waiter was all over the place except for at our table. At one point of the meal, he disappeared to get us spoons for dessert and 5 minutes later, gave us these huge ladle-like spoons, one of which was completely blackened. But onto the food: the rock shrimp tempura was perfectly fried, meaty, and topped with an addictive spicy mayo while my g/f's raw bar app was good but no comparison to the raw bar happy hour special. It was great to see that our seared yellowfin tuna and steamed branzino entrees were listed at $29 on the regular menu: the tuna was seared well with a bit of raw in the middle but the accompanying olive tapenade and tomato overpowered the taste of the fish. The branzino was light and delicate and ponzu sauce really came through although there were a couple scales my g/f had to pick out.  And finally for dessert, the homemade chipwiches were hands down way better than the peanut butter pie. They would give good humor a run for its money. Lure has a solid RW menu, and I really liked that their entrees were straight from the regular menu. But when we left the restaurant, we were still talking about how fresh those $1 happy hour oysters were and how many we could've possibly eaten. Definitely a 5-star happy hour deal.",6,2,3,Eric K.,"New York, NY",62,159,26
4.0,1/31/2010,"This is a rather difficult place to find because its ducked into some basement, but well worth it once you've made it inside. Think the entire restaurant is meant to look like the inside of a ship, which is a nice touch.I haven't eaten dinner here yet, but we've been here for happy hour multiple times. It can get very crowded and difficult to get a seat (especially since the area reserved for happy hour is very narrow), but well worth it once you've sat down. We always get dozens of the oysters and clams, and rinse it down with discounted drinks. The other happy hour food items are fine too, but nothing that you can't get elsewhere.Service here is great.

4.0,1/29/2010,"Just the idea of heading down a staircase to enter a dark alcovey basement restaurant has always been very alLURing to me (notice my not so adept play on the word Lure) so every time I pass the corner of Mercer and Prince and see the gold script reading ""Lure"" on the window peering into the fancy looking lush inside of this sweet seafood restaurant in Soho, I feel magnetically drawn to it... not unlike a fish swimming towards a lure.  Okay, okay, I'll stop with the fish references. But speaking of fish... that's Lure's specialty, as you can tell by the title.  Since it was restaurant week, I felt like I had the perfect excuse to try out this place that you wouldn't just hit up on an ordinary day. I thoroughly enjoyed the entire dining experience from my sample raw bar appetizer (which came with two different types of oysters, two little neck clams and two jumbo shrimp), to the seared tuna with fennel infused mashed potatoes to dessert...which was peanut butter pie made with real peanut butter  and quality dark chocolate so it didn't have that fake processed taste (obviously).  I would definitely go back here again for some Martinis, wine and oysters...especially if I wanted to make it a romantic date (again, I'm a sucker for the stairs).  The inside of this place feels like a giant yacht and I was actually impressed with the sheer size of the place.  I guess it's not that big, but I've been going to these little tiny restaurant ""gems"" recently (You know how everyone refers to this closet sized spaces as such) so it was nice to relax in a sprawling space (which probably isn' that big but tinted mirrors do decorating wonders).  The service was attentive and friendly but not overly formal or anything.  I think this place would be great if you want to celebrate an occasion, impress a date, or have classy drinks and oysters at the bar in this awesome and convenient neighborhood.  Ahoy!  Haha...I can't believe I wrote that... no, but really.... cast your line.... I mean....take the bait... no, no, that's not right.... umm... fall hook, line and sinker into Lure next restaurant week.  Hope you bite.",3,2,1,Christina M.,"New York, NY",301,483,52

I had the shrimp tempura which was to die for as well as the steamed branzino, and my husband had the tuna tartare and the seared tuna entree which were so fresh and delicious.

We walked into this place and immediately looked like outsiders. Was it because we wanted martinis at noon? Nope. It was because we were probably the only people under 40 there. However, we had a lot of fun there, sitting both at the bar for a short time, and then moving to a table.

5.0,1/27/2010,"In addition to its beautiful ship-deck/submarine decor and below-SoHo-sea-level spaciousness, Lure offers very good variety on their Winter 2010 Restaurant Week menu. The salmon tartare was topped with roe and melted in your mouth. My more-or-less introduction to Malpeque oysters was a pleasant one--they were crisp, fresh, and light, the perfect ""shooter"" appetizer, made perfect by the cocktail sauce (a vinegar-based mignonette sauce was also available).The sushi was solid, with fresh fish and nothing to complain about. Steamed branzino was simply prepared and full of flavor--no disgusting creamy sauces and minimalist garnish. Unlike other seafood restaurants, the meal didn't end, but blossomed, at dessert. We tried the double chocolate peanut butter pie (great) and homemade ice cream sandwiches (very good).All in all, I had a 5-star Restaurant Week experience, on par with Asia de Cuba and Nobu.",2,0,1,Yan T.,"Manhattan, NY",2506,1716,229
3.0,1/26/2010,"I'd give Lure 3.5 stars. I had heard great things and had peeked inside and loved the decor, so when I saw them on the list for restaurant week, I immediately made a reservation. First, I want to make a comment on the service. Although it was far from bad, it was a tad sterile for my tastes. Our waitress arrived at our table and said ""Are you ready to order drinks?"" No 'hello', no 'my name is', no 'how are you doing tonight?' She was a good waitress but there was zero warmth or welcoming feeling coming from her. I know it's restaurant week and that may translate to smaller tabs, but for a party of 4 that was drinking the bill was still over $200, and honestly the amount of the bill shouldn't affect the quality of the service. Second, the food. For the appetizer course we decided to each try something different, so we had the tuna tartare, clam chowder, a raw plate, and shrimp tempura. Everything was very very tasty and presented nicely. For our mains we only tried two of the 4 items: the miso glazed salmon, and the seared yellowtail. I had the yellowtail and I found the dish to be too salty, and I LOVE salt. The fish was encrusted in spices and served on a bed of the spiciest mashed potatoes I've ever had. I was extremely parched the rest of the night. It wasn't bad, in fact the sashimi grade fish was high quality, but I could hardly taste it buried under all that salt. I eventually started cutting the crust off, but as the cut of fish was small that ended up taking about 25% of the meat away. I wish I had gone with the sushi as I see many Yelper's rave in the reviews below. Both my folks had the salmon which was a nice piece of fish, perfectly cooked medium, and appropriately seasoned. Dessert was spot on. Ice cream sandwiches, peanut butter cake, all very fun and casual. The decor is def unique as I enjoy a ""theme"" to a restaurant, but it's a fine line between having a cool theme and having a Disney theme park. They land on the right side of that fence. I would return, but probably just for the happy hour. If I wanted to do a top notch seafood dinner I'd stick with my regulars: BLT Fish & Aqua Grill.",4,1,2,John L.,"Brooklyn, NY",95,234,0

My friend and I finished two dozen oysters :X2. shrimp cocktail - for $7 there were 3 shrimps. It was not worth it even though it taste really good.3. shrimp tempura - one of the best shrimp tempura I have ever tried.

I'm really the type of person who wants more bang for her buck, so I was unimpressed.In addition to these bar snacks, I got the grapefruit margarita and it was very delicious and not too strong.

Our first drinks were refreshing and spicy, so good, we wanted another. This time, our drinks were made by another bartender and unmistakeably sweeter. The inconsistency of the drinks made me love this place a little less.Our oysters were fresh, and the shrimp tempura light and crispy.This cosy-chic, nautical themed lounge area is great for a post-shopping pit stop, or pre-dinner drinks and apps.",2,1,2,Meghan B.,"Brooklyn, NY",378,4,0

I started with the Spicy Tuna Maki and had a bowl of their clam chowder. The clam chowder was OMG good!

Appetizers: The fluke ceviche was amazing! I didn't really like the tortilla chips it came with, but the ceviche itself was mind blowing. Well worth the $15. I also tried a kimomoto oyster, and its the biggest, juiciest, tastiest oyster I ever had. Now, now...get your head out of the gutter. Yes I am talking about oysters ;-) I also had the NE clam chowder, and really it was one of the best chowdas I have had. They had fresh clams in the soup and not these small shriveled things from a can. But hey, where were the oyster crackers? I mean come on, lets be authentic right?Entrees:  I had the special which was grilled striped bass, and it was very flavourful. The accompanying potato gnocchi and cauliflower were also good too. Me BF had the bacon-wrapped cod with butternut squash risotto, which I had a taste of, and I thought it was just OK. After all, it was cod, and cod can be well cod. Its difficult to make a really tasty cod dish. But still, I give them A for effort! Dessert:  I didn't really like the chocolate bread pudding, but hey at least my date did ;-)This is a great place to take a date, just be aware that it is a bit loud and you might have to shout.

Asked to sit at the oyster bar, which turned out to be a mistake since it's super small and not very pretty like the rest of the space. One nice thing about being there however was that the oyster shucking dude handed me a few extras while the wait staff wasn't looking. Overall the oysters were mediocre, and the selection pretty small, though the shucker was excellent at cleaning out all the grit before serving. Bloody Mary was fine.

The tuna tartare was perfect with nicoise olives and string beans, definitely tasty!  I'm not a fan of raw oysters and the like, but my friend thought they were good and she's a raw bar fan.  For dinner I had the seared tuna, which was perfectly medium rare on top of shelled edamame and portabella mushrooms, mmm mmm good.  We were so full by the time we got to the dinner we had barely enough room for dessert! I had the lemon pudding cake for dessert that came with a really nice sorbet, totally yummy!The wine list and cocktails were amazing! Service was top-notch and although it was crowded they didn't rush us at all.  We stayed for about 2 1/2 hours just chatting and laughing.This is a nice place for a large group as the noise level is a bit high but not out of control.  We're definitely going back for their happy hour, the bar looked amazing.I loved the decor, looks like a ship inside, wood everywhere and the music selection was nice, a lot of classics mixed with quite a few Michael Jackson songs, a nice tribute to the King of Pop.Overall, I'd definitely recommend this again.  And, you must get the soft shell crab!

5.0,7/24/2009,"I have only ever rated one restaurant on yelp before for being awful but as a regular frequenter of Lure (I go about every 3 weeks), I felt like lure deserved a raving review from me. Ambience: The restaurant is underground and once you're in the dining room it feels like you're dining in an expensive yacht. The decor is simplistic and beautiful, with lots of dark wood and dim lighting. The restaurant does tend to get a bit loud on Thurs-Saturday nights so it can sometimes be difficult to hold a conversation. Service:I have had mixed experiences with the service at lure. The maitre'd is very professional and sincere. After about my fifth visit he started welcoming me by my first name as I walked through the door - a nice touch. Also, the restaurant frequently does an amuse bouche (a chef's tasting or a small bite of something the chef sends to show you his cooking style/technique). This is always greatly appreciated - who doesn't like well-cooked, tasty, free food? The service in the dining room seems to depend on the waiter/waitress you have for the evening. Most nights the service is impeccable although other times I've had waiters that are not very attentive  and do not check back often enough (even when the place is dead sometimes). The bus boys are very attentive and check back frequently. The Food:The food here is really spot on. As someone who has gone to culinary school for fun and someone who has eaten at many of the city's ""top"" restaurants, I can truly say that Lure's food is exceptional. I've never walked out wishing that something was better or wishing I'd eaten somewhere else. Lure is my favorite restaurant in New York City and I have brought many family members and friends who have visited town to this place and no one has ever been disappointed. Things not to miss:Lure House Roll - shrimp tempura roll with a piece of tuna on top and a spicy mayonaiseShrimp Tempura (Appetizer) - really wonderful (also served with a spicy mayonaise)House Salad - very elegant and beautiful. Comes dressed in a nice mustard vinaigrette. Oysters - always wonderful here.Scallops with Mushroom and Asparagus Risotto - The best scallops i've ever had. Not one bit chewy or tough, Perfectly seared on one side. They almost melt in your mouth. Grilled Salmon with Pumpkin Gnocchi - This dish made me a customer for life. Wonderful preparation, executed perfectly by Chef Josh. (This dish is seasonal for fall and winter). Also notable: Spicy Calamari, Crab Cakes, Tuna Tartare, Daurade, Cod, Salted Caramel Ice Cream. Most dishes range from about 25-35 for entrees.I cannot give Lure a strong enough review. I truly love this place and as a repeat customer I feel like Lure appreciates my continued business.

It has a brioche bun, shredded lettuce, cheese, thin pickle slices, perfectly juicy meat that actually starts to sog up the bottom layer of the bun... It's pretty delicious.For $16, it also comes with a pretty generous side of french fries and catsup and mayo for dipping. Not the cheapest burger ever, but if you're in the mood for it and you're in Soho, you're way better off here than across the street at Fanelli's. $1 oysters at happy hour. Great deal.

The pre-fix menu was rather boring as well. I only chose it cause nothing on the main menu caught my attention. I opted for the raw bar sampler(east coast oysters, littleneck clams and shrimp cocktail), the linguine with manilla clams(pancetta, white wine, leeks, and parsley) and some coconut tapioca dessert. A.H ordered the chilled lobster. Other than the funky presentation. Nothing to write home about. I felt overall the food was bland. Maybe I just ordered the wrong items. The menu just did not look special to me. I would maybe come here for some happy hour cocktails and order some appetizers or sushi.

3.0,6/1/2009,"3.25 stars.I ordered the lobster roll as my appetizer and the chilled lobster (listed under appetizers) for my entree.  I know, I'm weird like that.  We shared the lobster roll, and it came out already cut in half with each of us getting our own serving if cole slaw and salt 'n vinegar chips.  Pretty nice.  The roll was extra small (even compared to the usual lobster rolls at Mary's Fishcamp and the Mermaid Inn).  A pretty generous serving of lobster, not too much mayo, on top of 1/2 of a single, toasted brioche roll.  It was fresh and yummy.  The cole slaw was a little on the dry side, interesting because it was a little more...sour?? than usual.  The salt 'n vinegar chips were salty enough but not as vinegar-y as I'm used to having.  My chilled lobster was pretty small and tasted, just as T predicted, like shrimp cocktail.  It was accompanied with 2 dipping sauces: cocktail sauce and ...butter??  The butter wasn't even melted.  The chilled lobster was somewhat of a disappointment, although I'm not quite sure what I was expecting since it was, as the menu put it, simply chilled lobster.T ordered the $35 prix fixe and chose a raw bar entree for his appetizer, manila clams linguini for his entree, and I chose the coconut tapioca as his dessert.  The raw bar appetizer came with 2 raw clams, 2 raw oysters, and 2 large shrimp cocktail.  The oysters were good, clams were...interesting, and the shrimp juicy and fresh.  His pasta was tasty, with bits of pancetta and tomato.  The coconut tapioca was my favorite, the tapioca extra creamy and I loved the coconut-y taste.Overall, my fave dishes were the lobster roll and coconut tapioca.",0,0,0,Junkfoodie Q.,"NY, NY",12,372,0

The service is generally great to decent. (Cocktail waitresses will take your order from the booths and little banquets with low cocktail tables in front.) I'm on a budget, so the full restaurant menu is off limits to me right now. But the happy hour features some scrumptious deals. Everything is reduced -- both bar snack food and drinks. My favorite is to order up some deviled eggs, some french fries and have a couple drafts of beer on the comfy banquets with a friend or two.

I got the Lure roll and the Yellowtail Jalapeno roll and they were both great. The ceviche was outstanding as well- great portion size. The tuna tiradito was pretty good as well.Definitely try the blood orange martini- tastes more like a sweet/tart grapefruit!However, the dish I recommend the most off the menu is the Warm Chocolate Cake dessert.

5.0,3/17/2009,"(Que Michael Jackson - Billy Jean)Every time i step into Lure Fishbar I feel like I'm a character in Grand Theft Auto - Vice City.Yeah - it's that cool. The interior makes you feel like you're eating in a yacht. The music theme is generally 80's (see Vice City soundtrack). The whole restaurant is so unique in this way. It's a bit loud, little dark, and really awesome. I ate there last night and I've actually got Flock of Seagulls stuck in my head. How many restaurants are awesome enough to play Flock of Seagulls ? And it works - all the different aspects of the theme of this restaurant blend seamlessly. But it can't be 5 stars without spectacular food & service. I am not, admittedly, a big seafood eater. Yet, there are certain gems from the sea I really enjoy eating. I've been here about 6 times so i've got a pretty good feel on how consistent their food is.(change song to  Flock of Seagulls - Ran So Far Away) I usually have a drink at the bar before sitting down. It seems to be highly encouraged by the host/hostess as well. I DO find bar service to be a bit slow sometimes, but i'm willing to let that slide. They'll make you a strong drink, which is good since they're slightly over-priced. Once we're seated, we'll peruse the wine list for something interesting. I don't usually drink white wine, but i do with seafood. They have a good selection of whites here - I recommend one of the White Bordeaux's or White Burgundy's. There is a white Bordeaux i get frequently. Chateau Carbonnieaux (spelling??). On to the food. (change song to Cutting Crew - Died In Your Arms).Appetizer - chicken noodle soup. Yeah, odd choice but i love soup and it's a pretty hearty soup.Entree: Steamed Lobster Tails. BEST lobster i have ever had. The presentation is amazing. It comes in corn/tomato mix with citrus butter. You get 4 tails. The tails are tendy, tasty, simply amazing. I can't recommend the lobster tails enough.Sides: Mac & Cheese, Fries. It's some of the best Mac & Cheese ever. They use 5 cheeses i believe. (change song to  Animotion - Obsession)Total tab for 2 people ? $221. Not bad considering it was a $90 bottle of wine, and some of the best seafood i've had. Service ? It's usually above average to very good. I've had service that is at the average level, but i can't let that take off a star from this place. Out of the  6 times i've been here, average service only occurred maybe once.

3.0,3/5/2009,"Came here for Restaurant Week. It wasn't bad but it wasn't terrific. My dad and I left very full, which is usually a good sign except I had a bit of an upset stomach the rest of the day... Maybe it's 'cause I haven't had seafood in a while. Still, it was odd, considering I don't have a sensitive stomach by any stretch of the imagination.So you go down the steps, and it's kind of like you're in a ship! Round porthole windows! Woohoo!(Unfortunately, there are hardly any exclamation points from here on out. *CUE OMINOUS MUSIC.)Anyways, let this be known: I love clam chowder. Specifically the New England variety. Seriously, I order it everywhere I can and eat the stuff by the bucket. Naturally I got clam chowder to start. The soup itself didn't have the greatest consistency, and I got all of 2 clams - frankly, it was more of a potato chowder. Pretty lame. I like potatoes too, but mine were a little undercooked. Disappointed, I didn't even bother to finish it. The bacon that was thrown in was a nice thought, but incredibly soggy without providing any real punch. Pouty face.We supplemented our soup with a couple of appetizers from the main menu. The Crispy Calamari w/ Smoked Chili Glaze appetizer was bountiful and had some flavor, but it lacked sufficient crunch. My family tends to order fried calamari everywhere we go, and this was nothin' to write home about. The glaze made it interesting, otherwise it was pretty standard fare. The highlight from the starters was undoubtedly the Seared Scallop and Pappardelle appetizer. I thought it was good; my dad on the other hand, loved it and so I let him devour it.The main course was the saving grace - I had the branzino, which is a fish I was completely unfamiliar with. Let's just say that I'm so glad we've officially met. One tasty fish - no overpowering fishy smell, very flavorful, light meat. This dish was working. Very simple preparation, and well done. My dad's fish and chips is about what you'd expect - they didn't screw it up. Unfortunately, it didn't blow us out of the water, either.The desserts we got were ice cream sammiches and some tapioca pearl fuckery. The ice cream sandwiches were good, but my pops and I were *SHOCK* too full to fully polish off both. We stuffed our faces with the sandwiches, since those were worth the space.The service was pretty good. At one point our waiter refilled our sodas without us asking, leaving my dad and I to shake our heads... Oh great, we're 'bout to get charged for two more of these suckers (and you know, IN THIS ECONOMY dot dot dot). But alas, when the check came, we noticed it was a free refill! Our waiter is a veritable Mother Teresa!Lure's a 3.5 with me. I have the feeling it can get a 4. I'd give it another shot, if I'm feeling into getting my nautical on.

I ordered Kumamoto oysters and Sea Urchin top of that menu since the raw bar appetizer only includes east coast varieties. The kumamoto  was exceptionally good and it made my day. Uni was ok and small. The ice cream sandwich was a bit too much to take with peanut butter. My friends had Lobsters and they loved it but not swooned. However, the place has good atmosphere w/ nice lightings and deco of inside of a sail boat. The bar looked cool to hang out. Maybe next time. It got a bit packed around 7 or so.

For entrees, we ordered the salmon, linguini with clams, lobster roll, red snapper, and I had the seared yellowfin. They were all superb and the edamame with my tuna had an incredibly unique and delicious flavor. I also had a glass of Prosecco that the waitress recommended, which was also delicious.

The only thing about that night i can remember is I got the lobster roll and thought it was marginal at best. Last night however I enjoyed the meal. While the Clam Chowder came with this OMG! people come from all over just to try it review from our server and it was good and satisfying, it was not the best I have ever had need to go to this restaurant just to eat it. My sister got lobster crouton things - don't get them unless you want some overpriced garlic bread with tiny pieces of lobster that you cannot taste. I got octopus and the scallop entree. Octopus was grilled well, generously proportioned and tangy enough with the vinegar and tomatoes. i liked it and would order again. The scallop entree was the highlight. I only got the app size portion since i was not that hungry, but it was more than enough. a HUGE sea scallop, perfectly cooked, perfectly seasoned over some parpadelle pasta with pork loin or something (sorry i forget). Damn tasty. Scallop was not over-seasoned so you could taste its sweetness. Dessert - there is a chocolate cake that comes with caramel popcorn ice cream. Get the ice cream and forgo the chocolate cake. Suggest maybe ordering the warm plate of cookies with a scoop of ice cream on top. i got the cookies and asked for a glass of milk. happily dunked like a little kid (one complaint - if you order milk with cookies give the patron a glass with a wide enough rim to fit the entire width of the cookie in the glass).

4.0,11/12/2008,"I am a longtime fan of the Lure Happy Hour. It's one of the best values in Manhattan, given the level of service and food/drink quality. If you're looking for an after work, swanky drink spot at reasonably unswanky prices, this is it.The ""wines of the day"" are $5 or $6 a glass, taken from their list of usually $10-12 a glass wines. Nice deal. They usually have a great rose, if they don't run out, that goes well with the fresh shucked oysters (which are, by the way, $1 each at happy hour). Tonight I had a perfect chenin blanc. The happy hour snacks menu is somewhat upscale: fried oysters, buffalo chicken lollipops, shrimp cocktail, etc. The cocktails are tasty, such as the Dark and Stormy, Grapefruit Margarita. They even have a few beers on the menu, at $4 each. What makes all of this a memorable experience, though, is the atmosphere of Lure Fishbar. As has been documented, it's sunken below street level, with clever porthole windows that set the tone for the luxury liner decor and offer a fun view of Soho footwear.

GoodSeveral tables next to ours were little loud at times but that's probably case by case.  Our waiter was not the most attentive but very nice and helpful when he was around. OVERALL:If you like seafood, especially raw bar style definitely put Lure on your list. Just make sure you bring your CC because it could be pricey for some. If you want to really enjoy food and wine expect $80-100/person. Also, it's the old Canteen in SOHO.",2,0,0,D H.,"New York, NY",89,28,4
4.0,10/31/2008,"I've done my Due Diligence on ""Lure Fishbar"" both on Yelp and Lure's website.  I've read other's recommendation and also perused their menu, available on their website.8pm reservations for 6 on a chilly but clear Thursday evening in October, day before Halloween.  Everyone shows up on time and we are seated without delay.I've actually been to an underground level restaurant before, actually across the street at Mercer Kitchen so I was fine with that.  The decor definitely makes you feel as though you are inside a yacht or luxury cruise liner.  Dim lighting sets the mood.  Very warm and inviting atmosphere.One thing I noticed, kudos to the waitstaff,  my glass of water was never empty!  Every time I reached over to get a drink of water, the glass was full!  Now that is what you call service!Appetizer:- 1/2 Dozen Littleneck Clams ($1.50/each) - Fresh and reasonably priced.- Lobster Croutons ($16) - Although I read about this appetizer, I couldn't imagine what it would taste like as I thought it would be croutons with lobster flavoring of some sort.  Well it was good and not what I thought.  It was a mixture of  lobster, garlic and chilis on a sourdough crouton.  Very small pieces, but big in flavor. Very good.  Couldn't really taste the lobster though as the garlic was quite overpowering.- Appetizer Nibble: Oysters (courtesy of Jennifer Y.) - Very fresh but I'll suppress my oyster cravings for $1 oyster nights at Harry's in Wilmington, DE.- Entree:- Classic Lobster Roll ($29) - Brioche Roll, Vegetable Slaw.  The waitress asked if I wanted to substitute the Salt & Vinegar Chips for fries which I did, which I regretted.  The lobster was very good, but I think the Brioche Roll could use LOTS MORE BUTTER please, maybe as an option.  The lobster mayo mix was good as their was not as much mayo as other places.  It was good but nothing exceptional.- Dessert:Choice of 3 scoops of either ice cream or sorbet. ($6) - Not bad.- Blueberry Mint sorbet - Refreshing- Coconut Sorbet- Salted Caramel Ice Cream - BINGO!  WOW!  Sweet & Salty with lots of caramel flavor. Reminds me of Garrett's ""The Mix"" (CaramelCrisp & Cheesecorn)  A DEFINITE FIRST.  Rest assured it won't be the last.  I should've asked if they sell it by the pint.- Passion Fruit Sorbet (Courtesy of Karen D) - Refreshing with a strong Passion Fruit flavor.Maybe Lure Fishbar should consider branching out into the ice cream & sorbet business, assuming they didn't buy it from another vendor.I was going to give Lure Fishbar 3 stars but the Salty Caramel ice cream, the wonderful and attentive service and the fact it wasn't fair to come here so soon after La Sirene and Cafe Boulud, I am raising it to 4 stars.Next visit I will try a fish dish, it was just difficult to pass up on the Lobster roll.I definitely recommend this place.",7,2,5,Billy C.,"Bayonne, NJ",242,242,49
5.0,10/21/2008,"This was my first underground restaurant in NY, which means it took me a bit of confused walking around to find.  The place is real fancy, obviously catering to the business lunch and dinner crowd (or whatever's left of them).  I came alone, so I had the choice of sitting at the sushi bar or the regular bar.  I decided to go with the regular bar since I had come for their Burger and I felt it would be rude to order it from the sushi bar. The waiter was very professional and attentive.  This place is definitely pricier than what I'm used to, but the service definitely reflected it.  I had forgotten what good service is supposed to look like, and this was a welcome reminder. I came because I had heard that in this place with Fishbar in the title, where they have oyster specials and a sushi bar, lives a burger of the highest quality.  For once, people were right.  The burger was large, but not overwhelming.  It was also cut in half so that you could easily split it with someone else, and when you pick it up it doesn't collapse on itself.  The patty (which I got medium rare) was juicy, just the right thickness, and cooked to perfection.  It melted in your mouth, in a good way.  The bun was fluffy and the vegetables (especially the pickles) were large enough to give texture to the burger, but not so large that they all fell out after the first bite. The fries were brought in a separate dish, with three separate dipping sauces (huge plus).  They were golden, crisp on the outside and fluffy on the inside.  As soon as I ran out of water the bartender refilled my glass.  Yes, the burger is $16, but it includes a bunch of fries, a burger big enough to share (if you get something else on the side), great service, and some great atmosphere.  This place could easily be a business lunch or a date. Also, the irony of the best burger in New York being in a fish place is worth the extra bucks.",3,2,2,Denis S.,"Marina del Rey, CA",753,2076,21

3.0,10/2/2008,"Came here with someone, I enjoyed the food, but a few things bugged me. I made reservations, was seated and the table was way small and had way too much stuff on it. Then i had to deal with 2 excessively large menus. Like a 1.5 foot tall wine menu and no where to put it! I don't see why every utensil needs to be on the table when it is so small. Aside from that it was pretty loud in there, I would rather not lean in to talk if i don't have to.The food was very good, we had oysters which were pretty big. I then had the seared yellowfin tuna, and some wine. Yum. She had some sort of pasta with shrimp i think. I can't remember if the tails of the shrimp had been taken out. I think they should ALWAYS be taken off before serving. If it can't be eaten, it should never be on the plate. For desert we shared a coconut sorbet served with a cookie, very tasty.Good food, but I probably will not come again, but wouldn't be opposed to the idea.",1,0,1,Daniel S.,"New York, NY",64,62,34

The oysters were fab, $1 each and very juicy. I do adore the Bellini cocktails and the Grapefruit Margarita by Tiffany, who made the experience better for the birthday girl and me. Although the tab was pricey, it's expected at a hidden joint like this that really does LURE you in. I felt like I was on a secret cruise somewhere!",0,1,0,Kim G.,"Richmond, VA",159,324,49
3.0,9/23/2008,"Lure is one of those aesthetically beautiful dining establishments that is both chic and creative with good, good food. Their entrees, however, are a little on the disappointing side when compared to everything else.I recently dined at Lure Fishbar for a business dinner. One of the guys in our party was a personal friend of the chef, so they seated us in the back and we had the whole works--including hors d'oeuvres served by the chef himself. Hors d'oeuvres included (off menu) glazed sweet shrimp, salmon tartare w/ caviar and these delicious small fried balls filled w/ some sort of seafood puree (I believe they were Lure's version of squid balls). Everything was delectable.The chef also brought out a platter of sushi rolls and sashimi which were all phenomenal and very fresh. My favorite was the yellowtail jalepeno which was spicy yellowtail topped with fresh sliced jalepeno peppers. Delicious.After downing all the sushi, I opted for the crabcakes (of all things when you're already stuffed) with jicama salad as my appetizer. They were delicious. The thin breading on the crabcakes was light and crunchy. Inside the breading was a ton of crab meat which was notably sweet and juicy.  I was pleasantly surprised because I despise crabcakes that are essentially 10% grounded crabmeat mixed with 90% breadcrumbs. The two crabcakes were also a very filling portion.For my entrée, I had the steamed branzino which was VERY fresh. The meat was sweet and slightly chewy, I'd say a bit more dense than bass.  It was filleted but note that they do not skin the fish. If this makes you squeamish, you might want to request that they take the skin off. I didn't mind, as the skin easily peels off. The portion of the fish was large, which I struggled to finish after the hors d'oeuvres and all the sushi. The branzino came with small portion of steamed coconut rice (delicious) on the side, and the fish was topped with a small amount of sliced ginger and oyster mushrooms. The fish was also dressed with a sprinkle of chopped scallions and ponzu cilantro. While this was a simple tasting dish overall, I would have appreciated more oyster mushrooms (they give maybe two slivers of it) and more flavor overall.  The portion was on the larger side and everything was fresh, but once I took a bite, it just seemed a bit anticlimactic. Another diner ordered the dry-aged sirloin which looked a little overcooked, but I didn't try it. Lure is definitely a place where you want to try the seafood though.For dessert, I got the warm strawberry rhubard crumble which I was too full to take advantage of. The portion was huge though, spilling over the ramekin. The crumble itself was divine and the inside of the crumble was sweet and gooey. The buttermilk ice cream on the side was superb. Others had the warm chocolate cake which was devoured by most. Although I didn't have a bite, it looked very moist and delicious.Overall, Lure is another one of those trendy and bustling dining spots in Manhattan. The SoHo location is ideal and the space is beautiful. The seafood and fish are all extremely fresh. The food is prepared under a very high level of culinary standards. My only gripe is that their entrees need a bit of a boost to be in the same playing field as their hors d'oeuvres, appetizers and desserts!This is a great place to impress that girl who likes food, but appreciates the vibe and aesthetics of a restaurant much more.",1,1,1,Stella Y.,"Atlanta, GA",124,366,277
4.0,9/22/2008,"Came here on a Saturday night around 9pm. The restaurant was pretty crowded, but my gf and I were able to get a table without reservations. Apparently there is a whole hidden section waaaay in the back, literally under the sidewalk, that contained a couple of tables. Not exactly a desireable spot, but the food more than made up for that. Recommended dishes? The tomato soup to start and the lobster roll. I am a huge lobster roll fan, and although I usually head over to Mary's Fish Camp for it, Lure's was a bit better, only because there was less mayo in it. (I'm not a huge fan of mayo.) SO if you prefer your lobster rolls with a bit less mayo and the option to substitute fries for spinach (yaay! yes, i am a strange one) this is the place for you!",2,1,2,Wendy L.,"Sunnyside, NY",173,234,6

5.0,8/13/2008,"Went here for Restaurant Week. Wow -- totally blew me away for two reasons:1) Decor2) PortionsOn #1, I felt like I was in a submarine, the lighting was sublime and cozy and they had cute round windows. The whole place was GORGEOUS and we got seated near the door but I could totally imagine a romantic dinner or a nice dinner party with friends more towards the back with the nice booths. The other side of the restaurant had the bar area which looks so cool and intimate but at the same time the space was just large enough. Excellent, excellent feel and definitely put me in a good mood as soon as we were seated in a half-round booth table.On #2, the portions were just right, enough to feed a very hungry person but not overwhelming to a health conscious person. I had the big-eye tuna sushi and sashimi platter for entree and the salmon tartare for appetizer. Then I had the chocolate cake for dessert which I have to say was the richiest and creamiest chocolate cake I've ever had. It was so crazy how chocolat-y it was. It was very yummy but I took about 3 bites, had some of the accompanying vanilla ice cream, and my sweet tooth was more than satisfied!The food itself was a little average, nothing spectacular except for the salmon tartare which combined with the horseradish sauce had a great smooth texture and I could definitely taste the freshness of the salmon. The whole presentation, the prompt service and the beautiful surreal surroundings convinced me the food was probably twice as better as it actually was. But it wasn't the food I was interested in at this point, and it wasn't the food I remembered with fondness -- it was the whole dinning experience that was worth every penny.",0,0,0,Vanessa X.,"Chicago, IL",169,487,0

They put wasabi on the sushi enbetween the fish and the rice, the sashimi piece themselves were small, my uni was completely unbalanced and may of been the oldest piece of uni , i've ever had.

The sampler was the best, and most of it wasn't even cooked. The branzino was good and salty, but the side of rice was not nearly enough to be filling and the sauce was TOO SALTY.

2.0,7/14/2008,"FOOD! I came here for dinner with my mom. I read on Yelp that the burgers aren't bad and that there were $1 oysters. Even though the oysters were not $1 (I had gone on a Tuesday night), I went ahead and ordered half a dozen oysters anyway, 3 kumamotos and 3 malpeques. The kumamotos were good (not great, but good), and the malpeques were just ok. Sad to say.. my mom said her burger was just a bigger burger with a bunch of stuff on it but it wasn't tastier than a whopper. I had the branzino filet which the waiter had recommended which was alright. It didn't blow my mind. The scallop special appetizer was actually really good... but there was only 1 scallop and the calamari appetizer was just ok also. It's pretty much standard tasting calamari. (For some reason, calamari tastes the same to me everywhere except for a few rare instances) Lastly, I had a side of asparagus which were old as they were hard and not crispy. The bill came out to $120 (I included tip) which is, I suppose, expected for 1 good appetizer, 1 ok appetizer, 3 good oysters, 3 eh oysters, a $20 fish filet dish, a burger, an expired side dish, and 2 sodas. I want to add that service was slow here (half an hour to take our order) as there were 3 tables there for dinner and everyone else there was having drinks at the bar. I almost got up and left. Maybe I should've. I suppose what you're really paying for is the atmosphere which has a nice little ""cruise"" theme.

The clams were pretty good, but the linguini like the salmon tartare was also tasteless. If I wanted to eat tasteless food, I should have just stayed home and drank water.

4.0,6/6/2008,"I'm gonna start my review with Wheelchair access, YES, YES, YES it is accessible. I said it 3 times 'cause there are 3 votes saying it isn't. Let the folks at Lure know you use a wheelchair - call ahead, send someone in. On the Mercer side of the restaurant there is a service entrance that leads to an elevator that takes you downstairs. The staff was quick to help and friendly, the service entrance was clean, well lit and the elevator was big. There's also an accessible bathroom downstairs. So Lure is not just accessible, it's very accessible.  There are already too many restaurants and shops that aren't accessible in NYC, by saying a place isn't when it is only causes more confusion. Now on to the food. I can't truly judge Lure's full menu because I was there with a 20+ party honoring someone and we all ordered from a 3-course prix fixe menu. I ordered the shrimp cocktail that arrived with 4 meaty, fresh shrimp and a tangy cocktail sauce as well as mustard. For my main it was the Branzino filet. Very nicely cooked, skin on with a very subtle herb sauce. Dessert was the strawberry rhubarb crisp which was really, really good. The decor is kinda like an old wooden Chris Craft speed boat.

It is dimly lit with somewhat of a lounge feel. Of course, following from the name, Lure, the menu focuses on lots of seafood. We ordered a variety of things, from sushi to calamari to oysters. Service was adequate, for a late Sunday night, though it did occasionally take us a while to get the server's attention. The food was good, though a little expensive (along with the drinks). In the end the bill for four of us was about equal to the bill from earlier in the day at Jean Georges, and while there were more of us there I don't quite think we got as good of a value.

5.0,4/28/2008,"Lure is a great place to bring a group, especially a party of six people. Their round booths, in the corners of the restaurant, make for excellent conversation and people-watching. Because my girlfriend wanted to do a triple-date for her birthday with her two best friends and their significant others, it made for an ideal setting.The restaurant is nestled under the Prada store in Soho, so I'd walked by it many times without noticing. Once inside, it's quite large and has a fittingly nautical theme, with yacht-like fiberglass pannelings, wooden walls, maps, teak floors and life preservers. It was almost too much, but somehow they managed to pull off a fully-themed restaurant without being over the top or kitchy. The crowd is pretty upscale with professional types, families and 30-somethings out for a special occassion (there was a slight B &T tinge to the crowd). With seafood and sushi options, most people should find something they like here. Many in my group did sushi as an appetizer (very fresh and quite good), but I also got a taste of a very good salmon tartare and fried calamari that was sensational, but a touch oily. I had the clam chowder it was one of the best I've ever had. The chunks of potatoes and clams were huge and they included the one ingredient that makes everything better: bacon. I actually found the menu for mains to be a bit narrow, but most were happy to order the Branzino. I tried the Yellowtail Tuna, and it was perfectly prepared over shitake mushrooms and edamame. The Red Snapper and full plate of sushi rolls also went over quite well.For desert, we split two of the warm strawberry rubharb crumbles and they capped off the meal really well.The wine list offers a huge variety of options, but is a bit spendy. You might want to work the cocktail list instead. Everything we ordered went over really well.I suppose it's the service that put our experience over the top.

I believe we also had the taratre and and something else but the tempura shrimp definitely stood out.We were brought about 7-8 different rolls and I'm not sure which was which but I enjoyed them all..everything was fresh and delicious and present wonderfully. With the sushi we also had the mac and cheese which I found way better than Cafeteria's by a landslide.We were brought out every single dessert and the little ice cream cookie sandwiches were delicious as well as the apple crumb pie I think it was, that would have been my favorite.All in all highly reccomended.. can't wait to go back!",0,0,0,Sabrina L.,"New York, NY",6,16,3

4.0,1/30/2008,"Lure Fish Bar is a cozy, underground spot of plaids, wood, and leather. Its nautical theme and expensive menu draws suited business people who stray downtown (of which there are many more as ""downtown"" becomes less ""downtown"") and rich women worn out from shopping.It is not particularly a place I could see myself fitting into comfortably or affording to go to on a regular basis, if it weren't for one special secret...Until 7pm, they serve a Happy Hour Menu which features one dollar oysters! Due to this exceptional deal, Lure is indeed a spot I think we'll be frequenting.The oysters are great; plump and briny with both cocktail and vinegar accompaniments. Other happy hour specials, such as the lobster croutons and the deviled eggs are a significantly less impressive deal money wise (the tiny four one inch squares of bread with lobster were 7 dollars), and would have been crazy if the waitress had kept them at full price (a trick she tried twice). But, I have to admit, they were delicious, so if you feel like a ridiculous splurge, have at it.Also at blissful half price were the cocktails, and a six dollar dark and stormy made magic with our two dozen oysters.The deal ends early in the day and is only offered in the bar area on weekdays. Perfect then for those days you might get out early and have some time to spare indulging in one of my most favorite foods.Lure was destroyed by fire in 2006 along with the Prada store above it, but they have rebuilt quickly and it looks stunning in a rich manly kind of way.brixpicks.com",0,0,0,Brittany H.,"Brooklyn, NY",5,21,0
4.0,1/28/2008,"I had a great time here for restaurant week dinner. The options were normal menu selections and size. The food was tasty and fresh. I loved the salmon tartare and clam chowder. They use fresh whole clams and not too much cream or salt yum!For entree I had the steamed branzino which was really light and tender. It reminded me of the steamed fish at a chinese restaurant only they use stronger sauce - vinegar maybe? The creamed rice was yummy but the portion tiny. I liked this dish better than the ahi tuna salad but it was good too.Dessert-the cinnamon gelato was yummy but that made the apple really sour so I had to eat it separately. The ice cream sandwiches were a little disappointing-cookies a little hard for the ice cream and the strawberry ice cream tasted too artificial.Our service was polite but not really trying. Dont know if that was RW or typical but we had to flag him down to get a spoon for the soup, etc.Overall I really liked the food and atmosphere was nice. Happy hour specials looked good too.",3,0,2,Lainy C.,"Los Angeles, CA",145,634,8
2.0,1/22/2008,"Went here last night with best friend Bates for restaurant week. As usual we ended up ordering from the regular menu, which I think is what added to our outrage about our dining experience. We were seated in a booth by the bar, at first, this seemed ok, the bartender was nice to look at! But  when the bar got crowded there were moments when the young girls with shopping bags felt like they might join us. We began with the yummy homemade chips, a dozen oysters and a  bottle of washington pinot noir. The oysters were really yummy even though we had to specifically request cocktail forks. We watched as tables around us were visited by the maitre d and greeted with an amuse bouche of some kind of tuna. We found it entirely inappropriate that the amuse bouche was not given to everyone, especially since best friend Bates had dined before and raved about it. We ordered some sushi, I specifically asked our waitress if the sushi chefs used wasabi between the rice and fish, you know like glue. She looked at me like I was nuts and assured me they didn't. Our sushi arrived, with wasabi between the fish and the rice. I sent it back. When it returned wasabi free, the pieces were smaller than the initial delivery and while the kampachi and king salmon were very fresh and delicious, the scallop was slightly fishy, I have had better at my local sushi joint. At this point my wine glass was empty and the waitress and maitre d had passed by numerous times before stopping to refill my glass; a bus boy who wasn't assigned to our table ignored me when I tried to get his attention. Bates would also like to note that he did not pick up his feet when he walked, a personal peeve of hers.Then our next course arrived. We ordered the roasted sea scallop with bacon, fennel, apple and caramelized onions. It was one scallop, no better than I have cooked myself, in a mushy puree with cubed apples, too much pepper, no onions to speak of and fatty slices of bacon. We barely ate this. The second dish was the lobster croutons; raved about by friends. These were served as six small pieces of garlic bread topped with lobster meat. Tasted like store bought garlic bread with salty mush on top. Not impressed, didn't finish this either. We requested the check and the waitress asked if we were full. I bluntly informed her that we did not enjoy the last two plates. In my experience this is when the waitress would seek out the maitre d for assistance, as an unhappy customer tells a lot more people than a happy one. She did nothing. Had the wine and oysters not been good, the experience would have been completely shot, but the fact alone that Bates and I paid $150 for being treated like 2nd class citizens when we didn't even participate in Restaurant Week ensures that I will not return and will have my wine and oysters in establishments that understand how to treat their diners.",7,0,2,Erica S.,"New York, NY",170,94,1

This place definitely lived up to my expectations and the yacht decor was cool and sophisticated and not tacky like it could have been. When we arrived, we were seated at a very small table for 2 and they promptly accommodated our request to be moved to a larger table that was not directly on top of another one. They had a great wine selection and our waiter was very helpful in making a recommendation. The yellow tail jalapeno sushi roll was great - very fresh and spicy.  We also split a scallops special and were equally as impressed.  Although the portions we ample, we still had room for dessert and the Mocha Crunch was great.  Overall it was a great dinner and nice atmosphere - can't beat sitting on a ""yacht"" listening to Talking Heads. Our only complaint was that our waiter couldn't keep our wine glasses filled fast enough and our bottle was not within our reach to do it ourselves.  Also, I would definitely make reservations because this place looked busy.  Cafe Wha is within walking distance and was a fun place to hang out at afterwards.",1,0,1,michelle l.,"Atlanta, GA",6,4,0

5.0,7/27/2007,"As far as seafood goes - this place is a home run. Comparable to other great restaurants in this regard (Aquagrill, River Cafe, etc.) -- the decor is awesome, as you feel like you're in the cabin of a large boat, with the recessed windows, polished wooden walls and floor and metal handrails. Also, the booths are very comforable and spacious, and if it wasn't for the fact that the windows look out onto street-level SoHo, you'd honesly expect to see sloshing water there. We went for brunch and walked out of here absolutely stuffed and wanting to schedule a return trip ASAP. The mussels were gigantic, literally the largest I'd ever had, and absolutely delectable, perfectly textured and flavorful. I had an unbelievably rich and satisfying lobster roll on some fabulously buttery bread with a side of home made (and warm) potato chips. Yea, I know, heart attack waiting to happen - but everyone should try something this good every now and again. This fantastic food was accompanied by great cocktails and superlative service - if you've wandered into SoHo and want some great seafood, you absolutely won't regret this place.

4.0,7/19/2007,"Peter took me here tonight on a mystery date.  We only live up the street so we walk by a lot and it was about time.  WHAT a nice meal!We did the Restaurant Week ""tasting menu"".  We had cocktails in the bar while waiting for our table and Peter ordered a Lagavulin, a dozen beau soleil oysters and I had a watermelon martini.  It wasn't shaken well enough so all the ginger in it which would have helped mitigate the sweetness wound up being in the last sip of the drink.  Nice drink for summer though.Peter ordered the salmon tartare starter and I ordered the clam chowder.  Normally I am not much of a New England clam person, but this was simple and delicate, tasting of clams (whole ones), bacon, cream and the sea.  The potatoes were small dice and very tender, and didn't overwhelm the dish.  Peter's tartare was savory, with a lovely acidic creamy horseradish with dill balancing the rich salmon. We both wound up ordering the tuna entree.  It was crusted lightly with nori, and served on a bed of shitake mushrooms with water chestnuts, edamame and edamame puree, and a dashi glaze.  It was simply divine.  The tuna was prepared positively raw, the way we asked for it, and the portion size was enormous.  For dessert, we also both ordered the panna cotta.  This wasn't as successful as the other dishes.  The strawberries were far past their prime, and as mushy as they were, the raspberries and bluberries served with them under the panna cotta were barely macerated, making for a jarring and unpleasant textural experience.  The panna cotta was served on top of a peculiarly seasoned...something...not a crust, not a tart, not a cookie, not a tuile...not really sure what it was doing there, on TOP of the fruit, and altogether just a peculiar and unsuccessful, ultimately, mishmosh of flavors.  Service at the table was attentive and correct.  Bar service was flustered and kind of clueless, but attentive and nice.  Overall, far less obnoxious than I expected, given the proximity to Prada, very chic decor inside, with an elegant sushi bar at the rear, a private dining room and attractive restrooms which are located next to the Prada storage room.  When I went to the ladies' room, they were wheeling a pallet of shoes in there and I had to hold on to the doorknob.  A most enjoyable meal, and a definite return visit, Restaurant Week or not.",4,1,3,Jessica F.,"New York, NY",87,252,49

4.0,7/8/2006,"First off - I didn't pay for the meal so you've gotta take that into account. Lure as the other reviewer has written is located in the basement of a building on the north east corner of mercer and prince st (near the apple store). The menu comprises of seafood mainly which to sum up is ""clean"" tasting and ""pretty"". We had the yellow tail carpacio, some sushi/sashimi combo and tuna tartare. All was great - I would say that you can't go wrong with the sushi (but few restaurants fail in the sushi department). I would have like to have tried more apps but that's what we ordered.The mains were a full dorarde fish with intense flavoring on top, a seared salmon steak on a bed of asparagus and corn and then a tuna dish as well. The salmon was fantastic (but it's a special and you probably won't get it). The dorarde was great but a bit dry and not particularly enticing (it was served all alone on a big white plate). Overall the food was good but not incredible. It's not a place you'll walk out of feeling overly full which is nice. THe desserts are intense and almost shadow the meal which was a little anoying. the coffee was fucking terrible - but New York is renowned for its shit coffee.",1,0,1,Bojo T.,"Brooklyn, NY",1,16,0
4.0,5/11/2006,"Located on the basement level of a buildings, with only their porthole windows visible from the street, Lure Fishbar really has the feel of being on a ship or a submarine of sorts. The cool decor is no surprise since Lure was started by the same people that did the architecturally saavy Lever House uptown.Ambiance aside, the food is good too - skip the oddly textured Lobster croutons and go instead for the well seasoned salmon tartare on mini-toasts, oysters from their oyster bar, as well as the perfectly lightly fried chilli-lime calamari that was so irressistable and tasty that my dinner guests and I ordered a second one even before our main courses arrived. Stick with the fish for the mains - the whole grilled dorade was good, but a very strong flavored lime herb sauce on top, but the crispy trout with pinenut salad took the prize - light, crispy and flakey on top and lightly seasoned, every bite was delicious. The lobster roll on brioche is also delicious - though not quite as good as Pearl's.A few things to note: many of the dishes we tasted had very strong  flavors that sometimes overpowered the fish - so push some aside to balance it out and you have a great dish. Management and waitstaff are attentive and friendly, but can sometimes get a little confused (especially if there's any customization involved with your dish due to dietary reasons).Despite the name of the restaurant, Lure has a surprisingly delicious burger ""Lure"" style - well seasoned and tender, the burger was not too large nor too little and the kitchen was great about giving my friend and I two buns with miniburgers when we decided to split that and the lobsert roll.Lure's desserts are fabulous - their ice creams are made inhouse and their ice cream sandwiches are back on the menu. Try the affrogato, two scoops of ice cream with a bit of chocolate fudge and caramel on top and hot espresso poured over - I replaced the second scoop (chocolate ice cream) with their peanut brittle ice cream and I'm so glad I did!! The peanut brittle ice cream was fantastic with little crunchie bits within the creamy icecream scoop.Lure is a tasty Soho option and a good seafood restaurant to check out. I would definitely come back - even if only to taste the calamari, burger, and peanut brittle ice cream again.",2,2,2,Chris L.,"New York, NY",95,276,9
